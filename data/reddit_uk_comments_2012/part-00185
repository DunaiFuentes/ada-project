If you think about it, the presence of the Headless Monks at Demon's Run was what allowed the Doctor to prevail over the Silence: it gave him two sides to turn against each other. If the Monks hadn't been there, he would've had a bloody battle on his hands.

There are many other instances where the Monks, while appearing to be antagonists, assist the Doctor indirectly. For example, converting Dorium and storing his head so the Doctor can track him down later. Or including the homebox of the Byzantium in their museum, the Delirium Archives.

true,CopreaVonDedd,null,null,"The difference is, when Donna was uploaded into the computer, her whole body was uploaded, and so were the bodies of everyone else that got uploaded. When they came out of the computer, they had bodies to return to.

River's body was completely disintegrated. There's nothing left but ash. I don't think her skeleton even survived. The Doctor basically saved her memories on a flash drive and put them on a computer. Her mind and all of her memories are all saved, but she doesn't have a physical body to return to. She is sort of still alive, in a way, because her mind will live forever, but he can't save her the way he saved Donna and everybody else. He put her in the computer because it was the *only* way he could save her. And he told the Vashta Nerada that if they let him and his friends go, he would leave them in peace and make sure no one ever came there again.

Now, theoretically, there is one way they could still bring River back at a point in her timeline that's after Silence in the Library, but she wouldn't be played by Alex Kingston anymore. If Moffat really wanted to bring her back, he could have the Doctor go back to the library with another person and somehow put all of River's memories in the body of someone else. That would get her out of the computer and bring her back to life, but in a different body. Also, that's not the kind of plan the Doctor would try to make, because someone else would have to die in order for River to live, and he wouldn't do that. And if that's not the sort of plan he would come up with, killing a person to save a person, then why would he even be back in the library in the first place?

What you say is technically true. River is in the computer, and all of her memories and experiences are saved, so in a way, yes, she is still alive. But physically, her body is dead, there's no way to return to it, and the only other option involves someone else being killed. 

I think the reason Moffat ""killed"" River in Silence in the Library is because he wanted to give himself a cutoff point. He wanted to introduce the character so we would know who she was before she actually started having adventures with the Doctor, but unlike other companions, there's no good way to justify why she would stop travelling with the Doctor. She never travels full time, she just pops in and out whenever she feels like it, plus, she and the Doctor are married. The only real way to write the character out of the show is to kill her off. But if he introduced her in a way that lined up with the Doctor's timeline, then killed her off when he was done with her, people would be upset. So instead he killed her first, then introduced her, so people would know from the beginning that her days were numbered. We know River's story now, and the Ponds, her parents, are gone. Moffat has nearly told everything he wants to tell, and in The Angels Take Manhattan, River told the Doctor that she was a professor now. This was Moffat's way of saying, ""get ready to say goodbye to River, because she's not going to be around for much longer."" There may be plenty of ways that the Doctor could save her later, but from a storytelling standpoint, I think Moffat intends for Silence in the Library/ Forest of the Dead to be the end of River.",0,1356541506,null,0,false,0,c7md6e4,t3_15h08f,t1_c7md6e4,t3_15h08f,null,1430774863,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Jack is immortal. More immortal than a timelord. 

The Doctor was fixed by River after being poisoned by the Juniper tree. 

The universe believes the Doctor killed by River Song. 

Oswin unwrote the history of The Doctor existing by the Daleks and it apparently expanded outwards as River is now no longer serving time for his Murder as now he never existed. 

Rose absorbed the Heart of the Tardis and lived. 

The Master ran out of Regenerations back in the Classic series. He figured out his way around it. 

Strax died at Demon's Run. He got better. 

This is a world of extraordinary and impossible things. If the writers decide she comes out of the computer, she comes out of the computer. I can come up with a dozen-dozen ways to easily explain how either she accomplishes it on her own, or the Doctor does. Thats without using anything NEW. (as in I can come up with ways and tricks established or inferred in the series). The writers of the show have no such constraints and can make up whatever timeywimey reason they feel like. 

It could be as simple as plugging some Living Flesh into the computer, then using the image of her body that is in the computer (the one she is using to appear human within the fake construct reality inside the librarys computer) to create a new body. Or downloading her into an Android Body, or she could become a virus like entity and travel from computer system to computer system. A time traveling version of her from the past could have her body copied by the Living Plastic and then THAT one could have Rivers computer current memories copied into it. There are tons of potential explanations. 

My point is that she is not dead. She is alive, inside the computer. From a literary standpoint there is little reason to do this unless you want to leave the door open to have her appear again. Saying she is ""dead"" is silly because she is not dead. She is alive. Just inside a computer. Considering the challenges that The Doctor and River and the other companions have faced and overcame this is a trivial obstacle to overcome.

Something tells me as the Doctor starts running to find out about Clara, we're going to be running just to keep up. I think she has multiple timelines that the Doctor will need to bind. I wouldn't be too worried about the ""romantic"" component of the new companion. People with a lot of passion and love for life in general are very open about expressing that in multiple forms. I think the Clara timeline in 1892 was attracted to a very unique man; I think it will take much more to impress a modern timeline Clara.

When does it stop being reactionary to look at the entirety of the year so far and see how disappointing we've been, see no recent improvement and a majority of important players who are so lethargic, wasteful and unimaginative week after week after week? Do we have to drop behind Chelsea now for the players to realize they can't phone it in and wait 'til April?

This isn't one player or a few players underperforming. This is just about everyone (save perhaps Barry and Nastasic) underperforming with alarming consistency. Set pieces have been shit, Yaya hasn't been used properly all season, Sinclair might as well not exist, even Joe's lost focus regularly, and we crapped out of Europe entirely without even looking like trying after dropping that result at the Bernabou.

It's not a knee-jerk based on this result, it's watching us woefully underperform all season long so far and seeing little else but ""more of the same"" recently. You can downvote, or reply as many folks on Twitter do with insults about my loyalty or calling me reactionary, but I genuinely believe at this time, we really need to consider moving **Mancini out** to bring our form up to where it needs to be and get something out of this season.

A friend told me his performances used to be unstable when he was at Atlético, but I judging from last season I didn't think he'd lose his sense of goal THIS badly. He still has flair and balance, but what does that matter when he's only scored 6 goals in all competitions after the summer break? It looks like he really wants to perform though, so it's sad to see him below par.

Then there's Yaya. It looks like he's barely interested in the game. He does make some runs, and a couple of shots, but this season he's been far from one of the best midfielders in the world, like he was last season. 

To some degree I'm happy to see City get a punch in the face today. The gap up to United is far from impossible to close, and hopefully the players realize that they'll have to give a little extra in the coming matches.

Personally I hope that both Balotelli and Džeko are sold during the january transfer window, and replaced by Falcao. Then we'll get a striker that we know has been very effective in front of goal, which is the oposite of what City have been lately. Maybe it would create a little more competition for the start XI as well. 

Mancini needs to change his tactics, it's obvious that most teams are defending with 11 players against us. Hopefully Nasri will step up when he's back, he had a good game on the wing in his last match!

I'd stick with your current course but yeah, if there's any chance of taking more A Levels and going on to a 'proper' uni (Russel group or whatever) then aim for that option. There are plenty of postgrad courses which will teach you whatever you need to know, and some of the degrees (while fun) are a bit of a scam career-wise.

true,Pergatory,k9,K-9,"I don't really have a complete theory, just an observation which is that there's been a lot of emphasis on the concept of memory in this season.

Both Claras, in their last breath, told the Doctor to remember her, and I believe in both cases they did a very dramatic zoom-in on her face as she looked directly at the camera and said it.

Here's the interesting bit - There was an occurrence of this before the Doctor meets the first Clara. When the Doctor, Amy, and Rory are captured by the Daleks and brought before the Dalek Supreme Court, Amy or Rory asks the Doctor what they are supposed to do or say. The Doctor's answer is very cryptic: ""Make them remember you."" At first I thought it might've just been his way of saying ""I'm sorry we're all going to die, but we'll live on in memory,"" but upon retrospect I don't think that's what he was saying. I think he literally meant to make the Daleks remember them.

So the concept of ""remembering"" being important in this season comes before Clara's introduction to the Doctor, although she definitely ties into it.

As far as where to go with that... I can think of a couple. For one thing, there was the recent episode which had the Great Intelligence constructing physical bodies out of peoples' memories. Perhaps this is how each Clara is created, by being remembered into existence? Then there's also the Dalek Pathweb that the first Clara hacked into. She referred to the Pathweb as almost a kind of hive mind, therefore I don't think it's much of a stretch to imagine that some form of her mind survived inside the Pathweb and perhaps just needs a push to get it back out again, a push from someone who remembers who she is. Then there's the whole idea that the Question itself was spawned from the erasure of memory. As well in the latest episode, there's the memory worm. So lots to do with memory in this season.

Minor addendum: I just had another realization. Dalek Clara was in the Intensive Care Unit inside the Asylum. The Doctor had to pass through it to get to her. We learn that all the Daleks there had been survivors of the Doctor. Does that include Clara herself? Perhaps she wasn't a survivor of that ship crash on the Asylum, perhaps she had always been a Dalek, and somehow at some point Clara's consciousness was imprinted on it?",0,1356549431,null,0,false,0,c7mf3d0,t3_15g7sx,t1_c7mf3d0,t3_15g7sx,null,1430775773,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

I've been kinda on the fence about him, but I feel this shows his value. A Dembele-Parker combantion will be very interresting to see, but even him and Sandro looked good and way less static than Hud-Sandro or Livermore-Sandro. Feelsgoodman.

Other than that Adebayor looked static, Defoe was pretty good and the rest of the team looked very good; Bale with the obvious standout performance.

You don't just build a physical staircase the wrong way round by accident. Those involved in the construction would pipe up, the actors might notice, the continuity editor would flip out, and it would be painfully obvious if the pieces were stored together.

Now, I don't have an actual explanation for it... I think Moffatt is waiting to reveal that later. But it's intriguing isn't it? Rather dreamlike?

Will we have pure historical episodes? Will we have the female characters being brusquely told to stay in the TARDIS and make the tea while the men do all the hunting and gathering?

The show acknowledged its history quite well in ""The Snowmen"" with the Great Intelligence and the Sherlock Holmes reference. But every story can't constantly tip its deerstalker to the legacy that came before it, otherwise they won't be stories - just inside jokes that half the fandom won't get. 

And I know that's not what you're saying, but I have a very visceral trigger reaction to any ""get back to its roots"" crap. If people want to go back underground, fine. I'd rather be above ground, with space to grow, evolve and develop. You can't do that if you're wrapped around the roots.

true,Nerflet,null,null,"No worries. I'm a current uni student (Education), and I've had a tonne of friends and relatives go down the vocational route. I also give general uni admissions advice to potential Cambridge applicants, and other students thinking of university, so I'm pretty knowledgeable, yeah :) 

Here's my thoughts:

1. The job market in journalism/media/film is extremely saturated right now with the exception of work that's considered 'highly skilled' - that is, light rigging, electrical work on sets, etc. That's because the last ten years have made work in the film industry through legitimate degrees a much more available option to many people - twenty years ago, you'd be hardpressed to find a film degree anywhere, whereas now pretty much all unis beyond the Russell Group consider it standard. More graduates in a saturated market = low job opportunity unless you're really marketable, with specific experience and skills that your competition doesn't have (here's where the freelancing comes in!).
2. The media industry in the UK is almost solely in London, with marginal exceptions at the local BBC broadcasting houses. Unless you can afford to live/commute to London for job interviews, working, etc, it's very difficult to 'break in' to the industry in a job that would pay enough to allow you to live there comfortably enough. Jobs like runners/assistants on the lowest rung typically pay £17-19K a year. This isn't enough to live in London, even if you're cheap about it.
3. Vocational qualifications are seen as 'less desirable' by good universities in that they are difficult to assess and may be considered 'easy options' and less 'academically rigorous' than A-Levels. I know a lot of universities will not even consider an application from a BTEC student, or will only accept it as part of a uni offer.
4. Most of the people I know who work/will work in media/broadcasting/journalism are working feverishly on networking now. I'm lucky enough to go to a university which has a lot of famous alumni with TV and Theatre links, so my friends and other former students are able to 'network' to find work informally. ""Does your ex-mate's dad work for production? Does he need a camera rig operator? Well, I worked on a play with him!"" This is how a lot of connections are made in the industry, and so many of them are impossible to make on the 'media degree' route, because you're not really associating with professionals.
5. There are so many people graduating with these degrees who haven't taken the time to 'network' and build social and professional relations and an experience portfolio. It's so easy to piss away three years in a degree without gaining 'real world' experience (hint: very few of your employers will care about a 'final project', but they will care if you worked at a theatre in your spare time, or produced an indie movie that won an award).

My tips:

1. Work real world, and find a degree at a respected university to take, and network therein when you can.
2. If you must go the 'media degree' route, you absolutely need to work and network, right from the get go. Christmas holiday of first year, and you want to go to France with your new mates? Nope, there's that three week work experience placement at BBC Norwich you could be doing, or you could be volunteering on hospital radio. If you're allowed to work during the term, take advantage: work backstage for student productions, your local theatre, at music gigs - but make sure it's 'relevant' in a way that working at the chippy isn't. Have a goal, and make your social time fit around it.
6. Pick what area you want to work in, and what interests you. Be specific. If you're into film making, make a list of your top five favourite directors. Research their movies, their process, and the route they took to doing it. Shadow industry professionals through internships, online communication, and research. Learn their process, how they worked up the ladder, and what they have that you don't. Go about acquiring those skills. 

If you've decided that it's what you want, by all means, go for it. But if it's in any way 'half arsed', don't even dream of it. It won't be fun for a good five or six years post-uni. It won't be glamorous, and you probably won't make it. 

I hope some of this was helpful. I don't want to seem like a pessimistic douche, but the world of work is so impossible for young people now in a way that it wasn't 20 years ago, everything is stacked against you. Enthusiasm and the drive to succeed aren't enough anymore.

Anybody who happened along to meet the Doctor this episode would have to cheer him up because we can't have a whole arc of him moping around. And the companion has to be female or else people would complain about a gender imbalance in the main cast (of two people).

So Clara cheered the Doctor up. It was more like getting back into the swing of things cheered him up more than just having a person around. It was also the adventure and the ""showing people the universe"".

Anyhoo.. I don't think that Rodgers has the pedigree to demand 3 years of Liverpool FC's history. It's a big club, and he's a small manager. I hope to God (Fowler, that is) that Brendan is Shankly's second coming, but he has proven nothing and the way some people speak of him here makes me think they were all born yesterday.

Furthermore, my main gripe is this: Brendan wants to play a possession-oriented style of football in a direct, physical league. Ambitious, to say the least. We've got a brittle defence to boot. I don't see his ideas translating to a decent league position. Not this year, nor the next.

The margins of modern football are getting smaller and smaller, you can't assume that you'll score three or four goals every match. Ergo, you have to be hard to break down, hard to score against.

Whatever else you want to say about Rafa, even at the worst of times, we were hard to beat. I predict that Rodgers will bring us misery, even with a generous transfer budget.

I wanted to bring back Rafa, I'm one of those. That ship has sailed, but that doesn't make Brendan the right man.

With the recent turmoil at the Bernabéu I am sure Real Madrid would want him.  The aging attack at Bayern could use his talents.  Both Inter (especially with Sneijder's departure) and Milan could use the help in wrestling Seria A from Juventus.

It seems we're now an inconsistent side, winning one and then losing the next by extreme margins, when only a few weeks ago, we were a side that consistently drew games. If we don't kill the game off, then we're in trouble and usually end up drawing or losing the game, with West Ham being the one exception.

The whole team was pretty poor today, except for maybe Suarez and Reina, although Suarez missed a couple chances and Reina could've done better on the third goal. I'm really disappointed with defense though, particularly with Skrtel and Agger, both really poor today and were directly at fault for all 3 goals. Enrique was inconsistent , great defensively at times, but giving it away the next and Johnson was average, okay defensively, but quiet offensively.

We've now let in 7 goals in 2 games to the worst offensive teams in the EPL, Villa and Stoke. During that 8 game run of form it seemed like the defense was sorted out, but it's reared it's ugly head again, and it needs to be fixed quickly. We're looking better offensively, although we're still wasting our chances, but for me, the defense is the bigger issue right now.

Then, when you get a new car (new Time Lord/Lady incarnation), then the car might be younger than you are!  

Maybe later you get into a crash, and need a new car a lot sooner than you expected (Time Lord/Lady unexpected regeneration/death).  You keep aging, however, no matter how young or old your car is.

So, the Tenth Doctor incarnation had aged a bit, yes - but The Doctor is a very old Time Lord indeed - his incarnation just happens to look younger than some of his other incarnations in the past.

true,KnownForNothing,lfc99,,"I feel really bad for Suarez. He gives his all every game, and the rest of the team is just so *lackluster*.

Reina - Good performance. Couldn't do shit with the first two goals, but possibly could have done a little better with the third. However, very brave goalkeeping kept us from conceding more.

Skrtel + Agger - Not a good game. Going forward they didn't offer much in corners, and lost the man they were supposed to be marking at times.

Enrique - Still a boss. He's so damn strong and fast, he's bloody awesome. But he couldn't do much, we need more than one strong/fast player to break Stoke's defence.

Johnson - Okay game.

Lucas/Henderson - Both quietly did their job, did pretty okay. Lucas isn't bossing it as much as he used to, but he just recovered, so he has to be cut some slack.

Gerrard - Good play, played both his and Allen's role - distributing the ball near and far. Took a good penalty, had a few attempts at shots, which are good, but probably just taken out of exasperation.

Downing - Meh. Okay game. Had his ups and downs.

Shelvey - Should have been taken off. Absolutely horrible game, he just didn't seem to be sure of himself. Looked for Suarez every time he got the ball, and would pass it to him even if it meant 20 defenders were hugging Suarez. To be fair, he drives forward well, makes good runs, but just couldn't do anything when he got the ball this game.

Sterling - Created a good chance for Suarez, then disappeared. Not his fault though, Stoke were pressing hard. Did well to track back like Suso.

Suso - Pretty much the same as Sterling. Created a good chance for Suarez, disappeared, tracked back well.

Suarez - MoTM for our side no contest. Honestly, everything about him is just so awesome. He goes in for every ball, chases every damn thing down and actually does stuff with the ball. Be it winning corners, creating chances, having a crack at goal, drawing fouls, this is the stuff we need from everyone. Spirit.

At least we got our penalty this game. We really need to sort out the defence.

I think what we need is not just a striker, but a proper midfielder that is tricky and creative. One that beats a defender and slips a through ball in. Right now what's going on is that we ""tiki-taka"" until we find Suarez, he turns, pulls his tricks, and then either sets up someone or shoots. Actually, scratch that. We need everyone to be creative. And we need runners on the wing, as in people to make runs behind the defence. Sterling always waits for it before trying to beat the full back, Downing/Suso always cuts in if they are played on the right.

Also, our players actually just a bunch of unpolished gems. Shelvey is good but his left foot isn't, and his first touch is bad. Suso's right foot is pretty bad and he can't head the ball well. Sterling's left foot is getting better I guess but still not very good, and he's very predictable. Allen is very simple and accurate with his passing but isn't creative enough. Henderson lacks confidence.

I'd say Agger is our only real world class player besides Suarez but I can't see Suarez sticking around much longer. It must be so frustrating for him to play with such lackluster players. The difference is Stoke play as a team, they know exactly what they are doing and they do it well. Suarez is the only player in our side that is a threat. I 100% believe that if we did not have Suarez in the side, that we would be fighting the relegation battle, it really is that dire. 

Look at the only sides we have beaten so far this year in the league. Norwich, Reading, Wigan, West Ham, and Fulham. All sides that are lower mid table or in the relegation battle. It really is hard to stay positive when you look at the facts. It will take much more than 1-2 Sturridge quality players for us to get anywhere near the top four. Our midfield and wide players are lacking. I still don't believe Suso and Sterling are ready to be 100% starters week in week out. Downing is too inconsistent, as are Gerrard, Jonjo, and Allen.

I don't think that Rodgers has the pedigree to demand 3 years of Liverpool FC's history. It's a big club, and he's a small manager. I hope to God (Fowler, that is) that Brendan is Shankly's second coming, but he has proven nothing and the way some people speak of him here makes me think they were all born yesterday.

Furthermore, my main gripe is this: Brendan wants to play a possession-oriented style of football in a direct, physical league. Ambitious, to say the least. We've got a brittle defence to boot. I don't see his ideas translating to a decent league position. Not this year, nor the next.

The margins of modern football are getting smaller and smaller, you can't assume that you'll score three or four goals every match. Ergo, you have to be hard to break down, hard to score against.

Whatever else you want to say about Rafa, even at the worst of times, we were hard to beat. I predict that Rodgers will bring us misery, even with a generous transfer budget.

I wanted to bring back Rafa, I'm one of those. That ship has sailed, but that doesn't make Brendan the right man.

Lots of possession, lots of pretty passing, no result. It will keep happening. Mark my words.

Shopping is really take your pick, go down Princess Street and meander back through George street and then discover Rose street, so much to see and do.

If you love walking, walk to the top of Arthurs Seat (Did it in dress shoes and suited on a night out on my tod) and watch the sun set or simply walk up for the view.

Regarding Shelvey, I'll repost one my comments from the match thread: 

&gt; He's a young kid that needs to polish his game, but he has a lot of potential. We have Hendo, Sahin, and Allen who are all like for like players, all playing a holding/box to box CM type of position. Shelvey is one of the few mids that we have that offers something offensively, except for Gerrard and Sahin to a lesser extent, but as I said, Rodgers doesn't like to play Gerrard as a CAM, for whatever reason. So when we play a double pivot midfield, Shelvey is one the few CMs that we have that can play there.

Since Rodgers only wants to play Gerrard as holding mid in a double pivot or one of the 2 higher mids in a single pivot, it leaves our options very limited when we play a 2-1 midfield.

2) Technically, this is unknown. The sets were often rebuilt a bit differently each time in the classic show, at least before the later 4th Doctor era.

Mickey and Rory didn't want him, but the Doctor only initially brought them along for Rose/Amy's sake. Amy wanted him for a pretty damn long time, even after she'd realized Rory mattered more to her.

The Doctor does interact with people who actually aren't attracted to him; Madame Vastra and Jenny, the Brigadier's daughter Kate, Strax, Wilfred, Craig Owens, Canton Delaware, Rory's dad, etc. But the Doctor never seems to choose them to be his primary long-term companions. Even when it's not reciprocal, except for Donna every primary companion has been attracted to him.

Even the Doctor's Dream Lord persona pointed out it's getting a bit creepy - the old man prefers the company of the young. And apparently in particular prefers the company of young human girls who want to kiss him, even if he doesn't want to kiss them.

It makes sense for many companions want the Doctor.

I think that since she can die, she isn't exactly a fixed point; more of a repeated idea that shows up too late **AND** too early for its big role in the Who U. The idea goes through time like a wave, putting Oswin in likely places where her role might be. Victorian England and the Dalek planet were both places she could save the world with the Doctor. Her ultimate role will probably be saving all of the Who U, or something like that. This also explains why she has the same character traits in both of her times (souffles, intelligent;heroic).

 The version, or whatever you want to call it, of her that will be the companion will be the one that arrives on time, so to speak, and we'll find out who is propagating her throughout time and space much like BAD WOLF.

In the snowmen movie where the angel has grabbed River's wrist. When the Doctor and River are talking about how they need to get her arm free without breaking her wrist, through that entire scene, maybe 4 minutes, I would approximate that eyes were on the angel for 5 seconds, and even then, indirectly because they are actually looking directly at eachother. That is the type of continuity issue that Tenant would have walked on sound stage, as The Doctor, and would have taken a ho hum written scene and it would have been entertaining for the value of he and River taking turns putting eyes on the angel. Smith? He isn't The Doctor, he's just the kid who plays The Doctor now, so since the director didn't tell him ""weeping angels kill you if you don't keep your eyes on them, so between the two of you, make sure one of you is always looking at the angel"" the scene is done like shit.

Tenant worked with a lot of the same writers and producers I believe. He carried the show when they dropped the ball. With Smith around, the ball just drops. 

Smith reminds me of Shemp from The Three Stooges. Both in how he looks and how he really just does not fit into the show that he inherited from Curley (Tenant/Eccleston).",0,1356564112,null,0,false,0,c7milf8,t3_15g4wl,t1_c7milf8,t1_c7mi2kb,null,1430777422,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,TheCheshireCody,adipose,Adipose,"Your Three Stooges analogy is lost on me, but I get the gist. I don't really know how much of the final form of an episode is up to the actors. The lion's share of credit and blame go to the director, writer and executive producer, but I can definitely see your point that the actor is the keeper of their character. TV behind-the-scenes is full of stories of actors confronting or questioning their directors and writers about elements of a script with which they disagree. Probably the most famous of these was Leonard Nimoy's invention of the Vulcan Neck Pinch because he didn't feel Spock would bonk somebody over the head with a phaser (as was originally written).

On that front, I can definitely see the point that Smith seems to be coasting through his role, not really thinking about possible plot problems. Tennant was a much more sophisticated, theatre-trained and -raised actor, but I think he would have failed that test as well, as there were any number of awful episodes and moments that should have been prevented from happening. 'Fires of Pompeii' comes to mind, as does the two-parter with the Sontarans stealing the Earth, in which the Doctor clears up the entire atmosphere and defeats the entire Sontaran army with literally the single press of a button.

I love Tennant in other roles (his Casanova is the definitive one, as far as I'm concerned), but I never thought he was a great Doctor. He mumbled, spoke far too quickly, and gave virtually every line the same laissez-faire ""this is so easy for me because I'm the Doctor, and you're not"" delivery. Compare any performance of his as the Doctor to Tom Baker or Peter Davison, and he comes up short. Eccleston was the shiz. Loved every second of his performance, even when the writing let me down.

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that it cannot all be laid at the feet of the actor. Depending on the showrunner and episode director, the actors may actually not be allowed a voice at all - especially on a show where a big part of the base premise is that everyone is exchangeable, especially the actor in the title role.",0,1356565843,null,0,1356569190,0,c7mizos,t3_15g4wl,t1_c7mizos,t1_c7milf8,null,1430777624,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I completely understand where you are coming from, I would hate to be the make-up artist on duty if Vastra was to be full time, Filming times would be limited and even location filming would be limited.

I think the main reason I want Vastra to be a Full time companion would be due to the fact that i am so over the love-struck companion. Donna was a great break from that, but she was still helpless, Vastra can hold her own.

What ever happened to Jenny, The 10th Doctors daughter/clone?

Do you? Politics, left and right, is really about obtaining and retaining the power to direct other people's lives. Power largely for its own sake. You might want to think about that.

Anyway, not attending a public school and not going on to Oxbridge is nearly as much of a handicap with Labour as with the Con/Libs. However, I met several Labour high-flyers of the Blair era when they were involved in student politics in Scotland in the late 80's/early 90's and this is what they seemed to do: 

1. get in to a univeristy, study something in the humanities or business school (PPE, Law, Sociology, Finance, Business Administration, something like that. Preferably nothing that your working-class parents would recognise as having any connection with an honest day's work) 
1. bring yourself to the attention of the student union political society affiliated with the Party of your choice (do not choose a Party which has never had any MPs, do not choose a Party which hasn't been in a government any time in the last 50 years.

1. be a busy beaver for the Party. Get involved in campaigns, debates, make a noise but always in agreement with the Party line
1. (hopefully) have a Party rep in your Union/Students Association/Whatever pass your details up the chain of command as a promising new recruit
1. get on the Party ticket for a part-time elected position in your Union
1. work hard to align your Union with the policies of Party
1. get on the Party ticket for a full-time elected position in your Union
1. work even harder to align your Union with the policies of Party
1. get on the Party ticket for a minor elected position in the NUS (the politics of NUS tend to run counter to whatever the current government is, so this prepares you well for your Party's move from opposition to government a few years after you graduate)
1. work hard to align NUS with the policies of Party
1. get on the Party ticket for a major elected position in the NUS
1. be sent on various “how to get elected” training courses run by your Party. Get new media-friendly haircut, shoes. 
1. work even harder to align NUS with the policies of Party
1. have the Party hand you over to a leading councillor or non-entity back-bench MP as a researcher
1. work hard to align your boss with the policies of Party central office
1. have the Party recognise you as a loyal footsoldier 
1. have the Party promote you to be an adviser to an MP who gets in the news now and again
1. have the Party recognise you as a loyal footsoldier _with potential_
1. work even harder to align your boss with the policies of Party central office
1. stand for Party in a seat with a huge majority for the other side that you have no chance of winning, for practice
1. have the Party recognise you as a loyal footsoldier with potential, who'll take any amount of stupid, degrading shit in the name of the Party and its Leader
1. have the Party hand you a safe seat
1. now you're a loyal back-bench MP and mindless lobby fodder. Recognise on which side your bread is buttered, and start sucking up to the whips
1. after this, career progression is much as before, but now you need to become dogsbody to a junior minister, and so on.

My top tip for you at your age is to get involved in local politics. Your local council will probably have a youth council, and in many places there are also youth MPs. Ask your local council or your school/college about how to get involved with this. This is a great way to learn about politics, meet some real politicians, and find out about how things work in your area. Is also not always necessary to get involved with party politics at this stage: in fact it might be a good idea not to get too fixed on one party until you have found out about the way it is in your area and how you think you might want to get involved.

Look at Todd Akin of ""legitimate rape"" fame - he was referring to the idea we all have in our heads of a violent rape in the bushes by a stranger; which I understand is not a particularly prevalent form of rape.

Look at the reaction to Julian Assange's being accused of raping this girl in Sweden, particularly what George Galloway had to say about it.

Look at *your* attitude towards it.

As a man, I am aware that some men almost feel like they are *entitled* to sex. I'm not saying that's you (after all, I don't know you), but... well,

Do you remember those ad campaigns from a few months back? ""Don't let a night of fun turn into a night of regret"", or words to that effect. The response was, regret what? As if it was the *victims at fault for getting raped*! You know, dressing like that, like a *slut* she must have been *asking for it*.

It's so prevalent, it's hard to explain. I'm not a woman, but it's obviously a lot easier to see from their eyes. Rape really isn't taken as seriously as it should be. Sure, it is getting better.

I suppose what I'm getting at is, the advert is supposed to make you think, before you next stick your dick in some girl, ""is she able to consent to this? Is she actually in control of her faculties?"" Maybe you would do that anyway.

But plenty wouldn't. An ad isn't going to change that, but I think it's a step forward.

The re-scheduled date was Wednesday 17th December and the match started but only lasted 30 minutes before being abandoned when a fault at a sub-station caused floodlight failure. Wednesday 7th January 1970 was the next date pencilled in for the fixture but that one didn't happen either when Spurs had to play an FA Cup replay that evening. The match was finally played on Wednesday 11th March and after a near three month wait and three different programmes being printed Spurs lost one-nil! Ironically Spurs' next match was three days later and was the return fixture against Everton at Goodison. That went ahead at the first attempt and Spurs lost that one as well, 2-3.""

The problem is that contrary to popular perception, the majority of rape is by people who know the victim in some kind of social situation, and rarely anything like the stranger in alley sort of thing that people usually picture. Along with this, far more people will admit to rape if you don't use the word 'rape' - that is, they either don't realise they've raped someone, or they're rationalising it away somehow, .

(Edit: And in case anyone assumes a bias due to the feminist nature of the blog, I'll note that the two papers analysed are both published in a peer-reviewed journal, though I can't find copies that aren't behind a paywall.)

Now, the implication of the adverts is absolutely not that all men are rapists or anything like that. That you can take that message away is perhaps an unavoidable problem - the people you want to address, who might not rape if they just thought about it and realised what they were doing, look and behave just like anyone else...probably up to and including condemning rape when you actually use the word. Since they look and behave like everyone else, you can't pick them out to educate them so you have to use adverts like these. I'm happy to discuss other possibilities, but I can't personally think of another way to do it.

A notable statistic in the linked article is the high proportion of rapes relating to intoxicated victims.

Stephen Twigg was never expected to beat Portillo in 97, that was his practice run, but the Conservatives were just too unpopular. 

Skinner is an interesting case, though. I understand that he is actually a very good and genuinely popular constituency MP. Which means that Labour would lose a seat if they deselected him. Why would they do that? Notice that he has been on the Labour National Executive, and was even Chairman of the party at one point (so he's not exactly a total outsider) but after 40+ years sitting as an MP he's only even been a back-bencher. 

As Lily Tomlin says “no matter how cynical you get, it's impossible to keep up”

MPs do hold surgeries, yes.

I could not help but notice a similarity between Clara Oswin Oswald and Scaroth[1] the Jagaroth.
In City of Death[2] , the Fourth Doctor finds Scaroth split in time into twelve pieces because he was involved in a warp drive explosion. Basically, a version of him is living in one period of history and the other versions in other periods that do not overlap. These twelve versions, however, can communicate with one another through some sort of inter-temporal telepathy.
I think Clara Oswin Oswald, now that we know that there are at least three different temporal versions of her, might have undergone through such event.
Since the Oswin we met at Skaro and the Clara in Victorian England both say thing to the Doctor, it can be speculated that the splitting event happened before Skaro was destroyed. (Since they both say the same thing they need to have a single memory that both versions shared at some point.)
So, I think the doctor needs to meet her before this splitting thing happens in order to find out who she really is.
Hmm..I don't have much else to say for now. I was just bored.",0,1356572253,null,0,false,0,c7mkg2j,t3_15g7sx,t1_c7mkg2j,t3_15g7sx,null,1430778383,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

But you have to admit that in this game, and many before this, he failed to put the ball in the net when there were chances created through the hard work of others, as in Suso and Sterling's case today. Now I know that he creates a lot of his chances himself too, and I also understand the capabilities he possesses to score goals by himself, but a lot of the times there are options he could choose that would have a higher probability of resulting in a goal. Like passing to Shelvey who was open in the middle of the box, instead of choosing to shoot from the narrowest angle. BR has repeatedly said how he wants other players to get in the box, well chances like that go missed when Suarez tries to do it all himself.

I love Suarez, and he's definitely the top player at this club, with the most amount of goals to his name. But too often, he misses chances to score which could make the difference between winning or losing. I'm just saying that it's not like the rest of the team's performance is so drastically worse than his that he should start feeling like he needs to play with players of a higher calibre.

I agree with the ""legitimate rape"" idea tbh. Most rape is by people who the victim already knows and likely trusts or at least is friendly with (like a guy you've been dancing with all night). The whole idea of a guy grabbing you on the street is incredibly uncommon and unrealistic. 

As for ""don't get raped"" - that's a perfectly valid thing to say imo. Before downvoting, please keep reading! Again, we aren't talking about strangers grabbing girls on the street. ""Not getting raped"" is about not putting yourself into the situation where it *could* happen in the first place. That includes things like not getting too drunk when around guys, watching your drink for spiking, not flirting too much unless you are actually interested, not being alone with guys (like don't go up to ""see the bedroom"" with the guy at the house party) etc. And yes, maybe even dressing a bit more conservatively is also sensible.

These are all perfectly sensible precautions which my girlfriend practices if she goes out without me. I suppose somebody could call it ""don't get raped"" but I think it's just called ""being sensible"". I dislike the premise that every guy who likes sex with girls is a rapist and that every girl who wants to have fun is a slut who deserves it. But let's be realistic - some of the responsibility *is* on the girl not to put herself into a bad situation to begin with where sex can happen. The whole ""don't turn fun into regret"" is totally sensible advice imo. A girl who dresses sexily, gets drunk and goes up to the bedroom with a guy is more likely to be raped than a girl who doesn't get too drunk and stays with her friends.

I mean, I wouldn't walk down a pitch black alley in a council estate playing on my iphone 5... essentially I am practising ""don't get mugged"" aren't I?

She seems to exist at different points in time, despite dying at least twice. She seems to have a fundamentially different view of things ( it's smaller on the outside! ) and is seemingly connected to past events she was in. The Daleks, for reasons unknown, converted and imprisoned her as their most dangerous inmate and needed the Doctor to subdue her.  During this time she succeeded in retaining most of herself and successfully hacked their network, which even the Doctor has never been able to do.

If they wanted to play with the ""special"" companion model Moffat seems to adore a lonely, lost TARDIS that made itself human to be found by the Doctor would be an interesting twist.

EDIT:  Another random thought.  What if Clara is a future version of the [Great Intelligence](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Intelligence)?

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"&gt;Has rape become so much of a problem that we need adverts about it now? 

Rape has always been a problem and it's only really starting to be taken seriously now. Rape culture is even more of a problem, and one that still needs to be addressed and worked on. There's a study knocking about done in America that found that 6% of men in the study admitted to raping someone or several people when the word 'rape' wasn't used to define their actions:

http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/meet-the-predators/

This is a disturbing thought and I think drawing attention to what rape really is and really can be (stranger in an alley rape is actually very uncommon, it's something like 90% of women actually knew their rapist (acquaintance/friend rape) would really help people look at their actions, the circumstances of what might be happening, and ask themselves whether this really is rape.

&gt;Personally I find them rather offensive; it's almost as if they say ""now remember men, we know you're all rapists at heart so don't be a rapist!""

Not all men are rapists but the majority of rapists are men. It's just an advert that tries to get people (especially young people) to understand that lack of a 'no' doesn't mean yes, and that being drunk means that people are unable to consent. It's not saying that you, me, or anyone else is a rapist, just that certain actions are the actions of a rapist, whether you self-identify as one or not.

It's an advert that's trying to fight rape culture, and I think it does a pretty good job for what it is. It certainly makes me feel uncomfortable anyway, the creepy sound effects and the one close up shot over the guys shoulder as you hear this girl just take a sharp breath.

Nope. A lot of people who rape don't even think that they have raped someone, but will admit to raping someone when the word 'rape' isn't used.

There's a study knocking about done in America that found that 6% of men in the study admitted to raping someone or several people when the word 'rape' wasn't used to define their actions:

http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/meet-the-predators/


Look at these conclusions from several sources (it's American, but I think the data can be extrapolated) :

&gt;**60% of male college students “indicated some likelihood of raping or using force in certain circumstances.”**

&gt;Men in fraternities appear to engage in more non-physical coercion and use of drugs and alcohol as a sexual strategy than do independents.

&gt;Every 21 hours there is another rape on an American college campus.

&gt;90% of all campus rapes occur under the influence of alcohol.

&gt;**Men are more likely than women to assume that a woman who drinks alcohol on a date is a willing sex partner. 40% of men who think this way also believe it is acceptable to force sex on an intoxicated woman.**

&gt;**Alcohol use at the time of the attack was found to be one of the four strongest predictors of a college woman being raped.**

&gt;**43% of college men admit using coercive behavior to have sex, including ignoring a woman’s protest; using physical aggression; and forcing intercourse; 15% acknowledged they had committed acquaintance rape; 11% acknowledged using physical restraint to force a woman to have sex.**

&gt;College rape victims receive external physical injuries in over 47% of all rapes.

&gt;**Of the college woman who are raped, only 25% describe it as rape.**

&gt;**Of the college women who are raped, only 10% report the rape.**

&gt;College women are most vulnerable to rape during the first few weeks of the freshman and sophomore years.

&gt;**One in twelve college-age men admit having fulfilled the prevailing definition of rape or attempted rape, yet virtually none of these men identify themselves as rapists.**

&gt;34% of completed rapes and 45% of attempted rapes take place on campus. Almost 60% of the completed campus rapes that take place on campus occur in the victim's residence, 31% occur in another residence, and 10% occur in a fraternity.

&gt;3/4 of off-campus rapes and 7/8 of on-campus rapes involved perpetrators who were known to the victims.

&gt;**78% of the men identified (as rapists) were an acquaintance, friend or boyfriend of the victims.**

&gt;Most rapes occur on the weekend

I saw Algo's point as more of a ""rules are not enforced full stop"", which is what I disagreed with. Speaking personally rather than a representative, I do feel that more enforcement is needed too. Having said that, over Christmas, the combination of the mods having their own lives distracting them all the more, and the fact of the sharp increase of people who haven't read the rules to begin with have made things very difficult.

The other major problem we have is trying to make everyone happy. In the one ear, we have people saying that the subreddit is moderated too much. In the other, we have people who say it's not moderated enough. It's that balance which is almost impossible but we try to get there anyway, and I reckon this is possibly the main problem we face. At least it's a big one for me, alongside the rules not being read.

Personally, the way I moderate now, due to the sheer volume, is I respond to reported posts within about a minute of it being reported and popping up on my screen (which is almost instant). And then I do the rest in batches, because if I did them as I went along the day, I'd never get anything done. This is why, at least on my part, the removals may not be all that quick.

Do you not think that that situation has ever played out in real life?  Because i can guarantee you're wrong.

&gt;And stupid because people in those situations know damn well what they're doing, and they don't care.

On what basis are you making this claim?  From everything i've seen people who do this *don't* consider what they are doing rape.

It would always be the same few folk in trouble.

define too much. Even if you actually could define it, it wouldn't matter, anyone should be able to flirt as much as they like and not be forced into sex because of this.

However this means you can't tell a brand new story and then copy and paste the originals ending without destroying the themes and value of your own work.  In Le Morte d'Arthur Arthur's death is a culmination of the themes and events that proceeded it and can be seen as nothing but fitting.  Merlin had nothing in common beyond the superficial.  The ending is nonsensical in the context of Merlin and the only question is whether the writers gave in to time constraints due to the cancellation and just wrote the easiest thing possible or whether they got cold feet and were unwilling to truly rewrite Arthur's tale.

true,lol_oopsie,null,null,"&gt; um how do you propose we go to 'girls only' house parties for instance? And what is your definition of 'too drunk'? Guys get hammered all the time but usually just ends up in them getting a bit embarrassed, not raped.

Why do I have to define it? It's advice, not law! You're being silly because it's quite clear what I am saying. Go to whatever parties you want, but drink in moderation if there are guys around or if you're by yourself etc. Aside from the topic of rape, it's sensible behaviour anyway not to get so drunk that you lose self-control - guys included. Obviously a drunk girl is a much easier target, easier to manipulate, or more likely to agree to something she doesn't actually want. By not being drunk, you avoid this altogether.

&gt; define too much. Even if you actually could define it, it wouldn't matter, anyone should be able to flirt as much as they like and not be forced into sex because of this.

You can flirt as much as you want. Just be aware that if you are leading a guy on all night, he's more likely not to take ""no"" as easily later on as if you never gave signals to him at all. Not all guys are like that of course, but I'm sure you can see that a guy you flirted with is more likely to try to have sex with you than a guy you didn't flirt with. There's no ""should"" about it. I *should* be able to walk down dark alleys at night or accept lifts from strangers, but I don't. It's simply risk prevention.

&gt; so we have to assume that most guys (that we presumably know at least a little bit if we're at the same party) are liars?!

Not sure where you got that from. I think you know exactly what I mean. Drunk at house party, hanging around a guy all night and he asks you upstairs. By saying no, you reduce the chance of sex happening. But by being drunk and going up alone into the bedroom with a guy, you increase the chance of sex. That's not complicated. Again, it's risk prevention - don't put yourself into the situation in the first place. And hell yeah, guys lie to get girls into bed... that's no secret.

Think of it this way - wouldn't you be horrified if your partner said they got drunk and went into a bedroom alone with someone of the opposite sex?

&gt;Actually cba to even write anything about this because hopefully most people realise how moronic this statement is.

It's not moronic at all. In fact, aside from not getting too drunk, it's probably the best ""advice"" here. How many times have you seen the ""she was asking for it"" or ""she was dressed like a slut"" argument by guys who have raped girls? By not appearing that way, you reduce the likelihood of guys raping you. Again, that *shouldn't* happen, but it does, and the clothes a girl wears is a relatively common ""justification"".

In an ideal world women could dress in anything, get drunk as much as they want, flirt with guys and never fear anything happening. You can argue that you ""shouldn't"" have to do whatever, but we don't live in an ideal world. So why doesn't everybody male AND female take part in minimising the risk of anything happening? I'm not condoning rapists - I'm advocating responsibility from both genders. Guys should make sure that a girl is capable of saying yes, and learn that no means no. But girls should also moderate their behaviour and take sensible precautions to reduce the risk. As I mentioned before, my girlfriend told me most of this - she's very careful not to flirt with guys or send the wrong signals, and she would never get drunk with guy friends or get ""too close"" in the friendship. Isn't that just sensible risk prevention.

To me, some of the [plot devices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_device) they use seem to be forced and are not always consistent. It also seems they make up ""rules"" for the DW universe as they go which aren't always consistent. Like the staircase for example, why would it be necessary? How are they walking on the clouds? How do they get to the clouds so fast on the staircase? Why couldn't the Doctor just park the TARDIS on the ground? I feel it takes away from the story when they have to take time to explain the plot devices they've created.

Then you have things like characters dying and miraculously coming back to life because of some insane time travel logic or some magical technology they just make up. Stuff like that to me feels cheap. Like the writers couldn't figure out how to get from point A to point B in a story so they just write in whatever is convenient for them. 

I'm not saying that I would expect the logic within the show to consistent 100% of the time, but if they at least attempt to be consistent it makes [the suspension of disbelief] (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief) a little easier.

Yeah and the Doctor was not being an aloof and lonely god in *The Eleventh Hour*. He regenerated laughing. His face popped out of the TARDIS manically smiling. He didn't need *a little girl* to cheer him up so keep that creepy ""hot piece of young girl flesh"" out of it. Seriously that phrase there creeped me out major.

Doctor, aren't you *married*?

Um yeah he also got married to Marilyn Monroe and engaged to an Aztec woman named Cameca and nobody's complaining about that. He's also slept with a number of other people. Nobody complained about the Doctor betraying Rose when he met River even though (imo) the Doctor showed more romantic feeling toward Rose.

""Clara Oswin Oswald"" is a loaded name in a season heavily concerned with the Doctor's real name. What's in a name, though? Interestingly, the pub Clara worked 'part-time' is named ""The Rose &amp; The Crown""--and ain't no such thing as a pub not having a meaningful name. Reminds me of [""A rose by any other name...""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_rose_by_any_other_name_would_smell_as_sweet). In the relationship of Clara &amp; the Doctor, we clearly see that it is the Doctor that changes names yet retains his 'essence' (i.e. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. are all different names for what smells the same: the Doctor). Would Clara be 'the Crown,' that which anoints the time lord as his role, a ""Doctor""?

The parallel of the the Doctor and Clara is interesting: 'immortals' qualified. One is always new but remembers being different people while the other is always the same but doesn't remember being as much. Call me crazy, but I'd love if Clara was 'new' in each episode, always dying. It would almost be as if the Doctor was the companion (he for once playing the role of ""concerned for the mental welfare of the unique being"").

Just shooting the shit: 10 loved a gift shop (maybe because he was 'born' on Christmas). 11 loves buses (said a couple times I believe). Clara tells him to run; people run to catch buses (usually because they're late, which apparently 11 hates but frequently is).

Bow ties are cool. Clara Oswin Oswald is c.o.o...maybe that's how he ""remembers"" Clara, the metaphorical noose around his neck. The ""L"" needed to complete ""cool"" could be the title ""lady,"" a U.K. Honorific, sometimes appended to the end of a name. Clara has been 'highest woman' in the contexts we've seen her in: queen Dalek of the Asylum, head/preferred barmaid, and duchess of the manor--each case having her in a singular capacity in relation to a space/room (TARDIS, timelord, timespace continuum, etc.).

Letting the bad guy monologue at you and then saying that you can't figure out anything you can do except hope the Doctor shows up doesn't actually qualify as detective work.

It's possible that Moffat's similarly lackluster work in the last season of *Sherlock* is confusing you.

I agree. It would be great if Moffat kept that out of it. Unfortunately, we got ""The Snowmen"" instead.

I was actually willing to give the episode the benefit of the doubt and assume that the Doctor recognized her as the girl from ""Asylum of the Daleks"", which would have gone a long way towards justifying his creepy-as-hell interactions with her.

But then the end of the episode reveals that, nope, that wasn't the case: He hadn't figured that out. A dozen lines of dialogue with a girl who does absolutely nothing of consequence except say the word ""Pond"" and kiss him is reason enough to hand over a TARDIS key.

But the narrative/story dictates that she's not allowed to discover anything because then that'd spoil it for the viewers. Plus, if you watched the prequel, you'd see that she really wants to get the Doctor involved in the world again. This is her chance to get him interested.

Yeah, Moffat is keeping the ""hot piece of young girl flesh"" out of it. To assume that's the only reason the Doctor stopped being grumpy is insulting to the girl/companion and to the character of the Doctor, who is not a creeper. Plus, it's not really nice towards the actor either. If she wasn't young and pretty but still made the Doctor feel better you wouldn't be saying such a thing.

But in the end of the episode it reveals that the Doctor *did* recognize Clara Oswin Oswald. He said he recognized her voice but not her face because *he never actually saw her face in Asylum*.

&gt;Really? Didn't you just establish that he's lost the memory of the last hour and has no idea who she is?

Except that we don't know if they originally met Clara exactly an hour ago or not. Because they like to cut all the boring walking and in-between stuff.

&gt;A dozen lines of dialogue with a girl who does absolutely nothing of consequence except say the word ""Pond"" and kiss him

Yeah sure, that's allll she does. Besides having the wits to realize what's going on with the place and actually try and figure out something to do about it doesn't count for beans unless you stop it yourself. It's the *1800s* for Pete's sake. What could she even do about it? It's not like someone has to be a kickass genius who saves the world on *day one* to ""earn"" the right to be friends with the Doctor.

1) Becoming a member is your best way of getting tickets. Craigslist is an option but that runs the risk of scams.
2) No need to book a hotel near the Bridge. The subway (""tube"") has a stop right next to the bridge (I think its the Green line?)
3) The tube makes getting around really easy. BUT London is not on a Grid so walking from point A to point B isnt always a straight shot. There is a lot of free WiFi in London at Pubs so map out your routes on Google Maps. They'll give you the bus line to take or the tube line
4) Celery? No idea haha
5) The Bridge is in one of London's nicest neighborhoods. I didn't feel threatened at all.
6) London is expensive! Try to avoid Taxis and use public transportation. With planning it is really easy.

As a side note (don't kill me). I had a great time at Craven Cottage (Fulham's). The arena is really small and super small (like 14,000 or something). My main goal was to see Dempsey play but I ended up getting to see Cahill play as well while he was on Bolton. There is seriously no bad seat in that venue. Also it is walking distance from the bridge (maybe 1-1.5 mile)

Then you run the risk of confusing - and alienating - an entire demographic who won't get those references. It's one thing to mention the Great Intelligence, done so subtly that even those who weren't familiar with their history. It's another thing if every episode, you've got the Doctor saying that he met this person and defeated that enemy on that planet. The writing more concerned with working in classic references than telling new stories? You'd have ratings dropping like flies.

""Clara Oswin Oswald"" is a loaded name in a season heavily concerned with the Doctor's real name. What's in a name, though? Interestingly, the pub Clara worked 'part-time' is named ""The Rose &amp; The Crown""--and ain't no such thing as a pub not having a meaningful name. Reminds me of ""A rose by any other name..."". In the relationship of Clara &amp; the Doctor, we clearly see that it is the Doctor that changes names yet retains his 'essence' (i.e. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. are all different names for what smells the same: the Doctor). Would Clara be 'the Crown,' that which anoints the time lord as his role, a ""Doctor""?

The parallel of the the Doctor and Clara is interesting: 'immortals' qualified. One is always new but remembers being different people while the other is always the same but doesn't remember being as much. Call me crazy, but I'd love if Clara was 'new' in each episode, always dying. It would almost be as if the Doctor was the companion (he for once playing the role of ""concerned for the mental welfare of the unique being"").

Just shooting the shit: 10 loved a gift shop (maybe because he was 'born' on Christmas). 11 loves buses (said a couple times I believe). Clara tells him to run; people run to catch buses (usually because they're late, which apparently 11 hates but frequently is).

Bow ties are cool. Clara Oswin Oswald is c.o.o...maybe that's how he ""remembers"" Clara, the metaphorical noose around his neck. The ""L"" needed to complete ""cool"" could be the title ""lady,"" a U.K. Honorific, sometimes appended to the end of a name. Clara has been 'highest woman' in the contexts we've seen her in: queen Dalek of the Asylum, head/preferred barmaid, and duchess of the manor--each case having her in a singular capacity in relation to a space/room (TARDIS, timelord, timespace continuum, etc.).

You are technically correct. As far as the BBC's position on canon, a writer could decide in a future episode that The Doctor is not a real entity and none of his adventures ever happened. It was all an illusion created by The Daleks, who are a race of hamster/dog creatures that run on AA batteries. Also there is no London in the show's universe, that was an illusion too. You *must* understand though, that in any show where there is a running set of storylines and ideas, going back on some things (like the aforementioned) is considered a terrible move because it goes against what the entire show is about.

But that's not what she says. What she says is that they need to pray that the Doctor gets involved because she doesn't think there's anything she can do. (Not that we've actually seen her do anything at all yet.)

&gt; But in the end of the episode it reveals that the Doctor did recognize Clara Oswin Oswald. He said he recognized her voice but not her face because he never actually saw her face in Asylum.

Except that's not what happens. He figures out that she's the same person in that final scene.

Not to just beat him, but Moffats trying to return us to the form of Classic Who, where the doctor would stay a bit longer, to fully flesh out the life of that regen. 

Don't get me wrong, it'd be extremely interesting seeing a new doctor, but I'm not so sure it'll be for the anniversary. We all know Moffats gonna try making a multi doc story, and cramming in 50 years of history while also bringing in a whole new doctor and establishing him would be too much. THey wouldn't have time to flesh out each part and itll feel half assed because those are two VERY huge topics that need some time to fill. 

Probably my last reason is because of Gillian's logic. She said shes not returning for the 50th, and probably not ever again, because it would take away from the emotional toll that TATM brought about. If Smith were to regenerate in the 50th, that'd just be sad. Oh here's the Doctor dying and regenerating, and now he's still around for another adventure. 

I'm not saying I wouldn't like it, I just think it'd be giving Matt Smith the short end of the stick. But I COULD possibly see him regenerating at the end of the series. way to kick off the next 50 years of who with a new Doctor.

The list of perky young females who get all flirty with the Doctor has gotten absurdly long at this point: Rose, Martha, Astrid, Madame de Pompadour, Lady Christina, Amy...

It's trite and it's worn out. I thought Moffat understood that: He did a delightful job of deconstructing it with Amy and then gave the Doctor a very non-Rose-like romantic relationship with River. But, instead, we're right back to Rose 8.0.

And if we're going to be stuck with Rose 8.0, I would have at least preferred to get either the Victorian governess or the tech specialist from the future versions of Clara Oswin. But instead it looks like we're just going to go for the complete retread.

I don't see the difference here. Vastra prayed the Doctor would get involved because, like I said, she's been trying to get him interested in stuff. We saw her interrogate Simeon. That's good enough for me because honestly I can't be bothered if they don't show her doing detective work on screen. If it's written within the storyline that she's been snooping around and up to stuff, then that's all I need to hear. I don't need to see it because it's not relevant to the story at hand.

&gt;Except that's not what happens. He figures out that she's the same person in that final scene.

I'm confused now. I pretty much said the same thing. Are we agreeing now?

&gt;Except we know for a fact that Strax won't remember where they picked her up, because when Strax handles the memory worm he doesn't remember Clara at all.

Oops, got me there. And the Doctor too apparently because he didn't seem to remember. Guy must have a lot on his mind. Funnily enough, this doesn't bother me. Maybe because your arguments for disliking this story so far was the Doctor forgetting about Strax's memory loss, the lack of onscreen evidence of Vastra's detecting, and that the Doctor did recognize Oswin at the end of the story (I still don't get that last one).

I mean if those three things are your only big problems with this story then I don't see what you're so unhappy about. Yeah there were things I didn't like/was concerned about, but overall I thought it was good.

true,RomanAbramovich,RU,russia,"*Do I have to be a member to purchase tickets? If not, what are the benefits of becoming a member?*

No you don't have to be a member, but being a member gives you early access to buy tickets from the club. Otherwise, when the tickets are sold out (which is likely if you're not a member) you can get them (legally, safely and expensively) from www.viagogo.com

*Should I try to book a hotel near Stamford Bridge (the match is the main event of my trip)?*

You don't need to book hotels around the Bridge as there are a lot of public transport options around London. Fulham Broadway is the Tube station right next to the Bridge (about 100m) and if you get it on matchday, every single person there will be a Chelsea fan walking there so you won't miss it (come out of the station, turn left).

Edit: It may be worth checking out www.travelodge.com and www.premierinn.com, they are cheap chains which always give the same 3* service, so it's nothing fantastic but they're value for money, safe and at least you know at that price it's a rather nice stay.

*Is it easy to get around in London?*

As I said in my previous answer, I'd say it's pretty damn easy. As long as the tube is running (which it should unless the drivers go on strike again - dicks). Your best bet is to either buy an Oyster card and put money on it, which allows you to travel around London on buses and tubes, or buy an All Day TravelCard Zones 1-6, which allows you to travel on the tube unrestricted all day.

*Is celery still banned inside the grounds (haha)?*

Yes, don't risk getting chucked out for something so menial.

*Is the area around Stamford Bridge safe?*

The Bridge is in the nice bit of London in the South West, just a stone's throw away from Kensington (where every house/flat has a minimum value of £1m no matter how small). However, London is a big city and a lot of tourists go there, so you will find trouble if you don't keep your wits about you. I don't mean to scare you, but it's just worth knowing to be alert. If you stay with the crowd to and from the station you will be as safe as can be. No one is going to mug you in a crowd of a few thousand, haha. The really touristy areas are quite safe (Whitehall, Westminster eg) but just don't be the guy who walks down a long dark alley at night.

I entirely agree that rapists are the problem and I'm not apportioning any blame on the woman at all. However, if you look at most rapes - they happen when a girl is drunk because it makes her an easy target. So rather than say ""well you should be able to get as drunk as you want without fear"", I'm saying ""don't get too drunk and avoid making yourself a target"" because that is simply the realistic advice in the real world.

It will take generations to vanish this kind of rape from society. The reporting rate is probably understated for the number of actual rapes that happen and the prosecution and conviction rates are even lower. That's a bad thing obviously. You can argue that it *should* stop, and I agree, but until then why don't guys AND girls take steps to reduce the risk of it happening. What's wrong with saying that?

Clearly not all men are rapists, but isn't avoiding the situation better altogether? As I mentioned earlier, my girlfriend avoids getting too close with male friends, and she wouldn't ever get drunk around them. It's not because she thinks they will grab her at any minute - it's that she doesn't ever want to be in the situation where they hit on her. Same if she goes out - she knows where her friends are, doesn't get separated, doesn't get too drunk. Isn't that just being sensible?

Out of two girls - A and B, A gets drunk and goes to a house party in sexy clothes and flirts wildly with the guys while getting more and more drunk. One of the guys leads her drunkenly upstairs and off she goes. Girl B stays a bit more sober, isn't attracting the attention of all the guys and her friends are keeping an eye on her. Which girl, rightly or wrongly, is more likely to be raped? Which would you advise your girlfriend or mum to be like? Clearly the fault is 100% with the rapist, but statistically one girl is in more danger than the other. Wouldn't you want your mum/girlfriend to be the low risk one?

I see what you are saying, but this isn't an ideal world. The fact is that drunk girls (and yes, ones who ""lead the guy on"" or ""she was asking for it"" too) get raped more.

As for the words, I take 'Wibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey' not just as a silly catchphrase from the show (even if that is what it is) but more from the full quote from 10 about the nature of time, ""its not a linear progression of events but more a big ball of wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff.""

true,TakenByVultures,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"&gt;I absolutely abide halal and kosher slaughtering methods as they are barbaric compared to non religious methods, but that usually goes without check. Millions of animals are slaughtered each year by these methods. Many more so than foxs by the hounds. 

I am in agreement. Not sure how this legitimises cruel forms of hunting though?

It is quite possible to abhor all forms of animal cruelty, as I do. Personally I believe that at the very least halal/kosher meat should be labelled as such thereby allowing the consumer to make an informed choice. I also believe that spineless ministers are terrified of whipping up a shitstorm of epic proporitions in even discussing this issue. 

&gt;If the hobby wasn't one practiced by the upper classes, and the quarry wasn't one so perceivably cute and fluffy, no one would give a crap. 

Those who disagree with animal testing would like a word. Not many people perceive rats as 'cute', nor scientists as 'upper class' - but are you telling me there is no vocal movement against such practices?

I agree that the perception of foxes as 'cute' probably made the campaign to ban hunting with dogs easier to market though. Doesn't make the principle any less valid.

[edit] And your point on class - that probably does come into it. If I directed my dog to rip up the neighbours cat (obviously not something I'd ever want to do, but let's think hypothetically here), I'd have the police on my arse and my face splashed across the local rag.

My grandfather, whose skills for farming kept him out of the war, kept pheasants and rehabilitated (still does) whatever wild life came into his land. He took great delight in protecting the foxes (and to be fair his fields of strawberries) if they ran across his land and told the hunters to go fuck themselves, usually with a 12 bore in his hands. My dad grew up in a large working class family in the middle of the village over from here, worked various jobs with animals. He tried beating (as in scaring the pheasants from the scrub/trees for shooting) while desperate for cash and was treated like shit by the shooters, and saw the Us and Them in play.

It may pose more significance but that does not mean it poses none to those who haven't seen the older series. Many wanted to see the full new intro, the first big change in recent who, in its entirety for the first time during the broadcast. 

Are the only people that are meant to find significance in it are the people who are either more fortunate to see it earlier, or bother to watch it early online? 

Well I disagree. 

Regardless on if others will find its significance or not, you cannot simply assume that people are in a sector of non classic watchers who won't realize, and people who do watch classic and already have seen the broadcast because they had the time before the us version to see it whether in a different countries broadcast, or online.

Part of the reason I got invested in Arrow was the superb genre crew behind the curtain. I'm not a big comic book fan, but I became a huge Supernatural fan because it was what Kim Manners tackled after the X-Files... and CW took SPN out of the Friday death slot to Wednesday with Arrow as the lead-in.     

If you're on the fence, Arrow is really well done. Barrowman has only had about 10 minutes onscreen (total) thus far in Arrow and I don't think they'd tangle him up for future episodes in a way that prevented him from appearing in an iconic capacity as Harkness.

The Angels here were strong enough to be able to control the other statues. The statues themselves were not Angels but statues that were under the Angels' power, including Liberty.

&gt; 2. In The Power Of Three, it makes it really look like Amy's little monologue at the very end implies that the Tally is going to find out all about ""The Power of Three"" and it zooms in on a tableau of herself, Rory, and the Doctor...why would they even imply that if the next episode they kill both of them off?  

What? The point of the end was to show that they were going to restart their adventures, which added a point of tragedy to it because we knew they didn't have long left.

&gt; 3. If the Doctor can never see them again...how does River get the manuscript for the book? She got a forward in the end from Amy, so, clearly, they had to have contact, and she had to talk to her to get it published. If she can talk to them, why can't the Doctor?  

The Doctor uses the TARDIS which is now unable to return to that point due to the time distortions; River's vortex manipulator creates a smaller disturbance and so is more manoeuvrable (but still difficult to return now).

This survey is saying the overwhelming majority want to ban hunting foxes. I doubt 76% of people want to ban testing cancer cures on mice. (although I don't doubt that some dodgy wording of questions could give you a result like that, but that's a different matter)

As for your comment about the cat, the police would be on you because the spirit of the law suggests you maliciously killed an animal that was someone else's property.

Is a wild animal really the same as an owned domesticated one? It also depends on your motivations. You kill a wild animal and it probably doesn't affect anyone directly.

I suspect a majority of the 76% people would accept that you can't let foxes breed uncontrollably, and it's likely they are against the sporting aspect of hunting foxes with cruel methods.

Personally I don't care, I'd prefer if the foxes were culled in the most humane way possible, but the bottom line is that foxes CAN be a pest and when they are they DO need to be culled.

Have you thought about going into business? Starting and growing a business can by the most rewarding life experience as it puts up an immense amount of challenges and opportunities that make you a more well rounded person. Plus, depending on what kind of business, you can bring a lot to a community and reflect your political foundations within the way you approach business. I know the obvious question is ""A business doing what?"" but that really comes down to where your passions and talent lies, or identifying a part of a community that could benefit from a specific set of services/products. A lot of MP's started off in business, and my belief is that more should do so.

One thing to remember though, planning too much doesn't leave much room for mistakes, and making mistakes is one of the best way to find the best paths in life. I understand being an MP means a lot to you NOW, but don't focus too much on the end destination, and just do all you can to make sure your journey towards it is full of fun, worthwhile and positive experiences.

How long do you think it will take to ""sort out"" the problem? A rapist has a low chance of ever being caught.

And the argument of ""she was asking for it"" is STILL going strong, whether we like it or not. Hopefully that perception will change, but in the meanwhile why give rapists that argument?

You can argue that women *should* be able to get drunk and be sure that they won't be raped. And I agree entirely, but it's sadly just not realistic right now. If it was your girlfriend or mum, would you advise her to stay a bit more sober or to get completely hammered? Which do you think puts her at higher risk?

true,[deleted],null,null,"It is very difficult to write tax law that doesn't become onerous that can't be avoided. Generally with larger companies its more of an implicit agreement that they won't take the piss and the government won't hound them.

If you imagine the capacity for the government to write laws and large organisations to hire accountants, if it was a race to the bottom of 'write new rules / avoid new rules' both governments and large organisations would lose out. As well as creating a mess of tax law that becomes impossibly hard to police or even to fully comply with when there are hundreds of rules. 

Current tax law is fairly straightforward and nice, the problem is the setting up of convoluted arrangements by a minority of large companies who can't even be bothered to pay a token amount of tax - in a similar way to how Jimmy Carr had arranged his affairs so his income went through 100 small companies or something.

It's not the case that the MD has the responsibility to immediately maximise all returns on capital, by aggressively avoiding tax he is taking political risks that the governments will turn on the company which is bad for the long term wellbeing of the organisation.

I'm not surprised that a number of these companies are American because the culture of law in America is you follow the *letter* of the law and disregard the spirit. In the UK generally you follow the spirit of the law and even if you feel you have dressed something up to be ok under some law, a judge may bitchslap you down anyway for taking the mick.

That said, like I said before accountants and lawmakers know everyone will be slightly creative. So they allow for this, a small amount of 'creative slack' as it were.

true,TakenByVultures,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"&gt;This survey is saying the overwhelming majority want to ban hunting foxes. I doubt 76% of people want to ban testing cancer cures on mice. (although I don't doubt that some dodgy wording of questions could give you a result like that, but that's a different matter)

Even if there was no overwhelming majority, the fact that I get stopped at least a couple of times a year on the high street to sign petitions against animal testing is a clear indicator to me that people don't just care about 'rich people killing fluffy things' as the previous poster suggested.

&gt;As for your comment about the cat, the police would be on you because the spirit of the law suggests you maliciously killed an animal that was someone else's property.

No, the police would be on me because I'm much easier to charge and prosecute. Whether or not an animal is someone's 'property' (and I use that in the loosest sense - I keep rats and I consider them companions, not property) is irrelevant if the method in which they're killed is inhumane. 

&gt;Is a wild animal really the same as an owned domesticated one?

Does that matter for the purposes of this discussion? Not to me, but then again it sounds like we place a different value on the worth of a living creature depending on whether a human 'owns' it or not. Whether an animal is domesticated or not has no bearing on the level of pain/suffering it experiences.

&gt;the bottom line is that foxes CAN be a pest and when they are they DO need to be culled. 

I've never stated otherwise. I'm not stupid - I know populations can sometimes run rampant. This is no argument for inhumane hunting though. For a start it's completely ineffective. How many foxes does a hunt catch? One or two every few weeks? Do you really think that makes any sort of significant impact on wild populations? Secondly, there are much more humane and efficient ways of culling that spare the animal any unnecessary suffering.

&gt;If someone enjoys that job, or even considers it a leisure activity, It doesn't affect anyone else.

I'd suggest anyone who enjoys seeing an animal ripped to shreds for fun (fun, not necessity) isn't quite 'all there'. If we're talking about your local Rentakill officer with some poison, then I agree.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"You've made the same point ""as large as they can be while remaining competitive"".  Adam Smith pointed out that profits will tend to zero, because every percentage point of profit is an opportunity for your competitor to undercut you.  That's what drives prices down.  Corporations have no magic source of money -- it is the customer.  If there were no corporation tax to pay, then that would be profit that a competitor could use to undercut you.  It's fairly obvious then that corporation tax is paid by the customer in higher prices.

Similarly, ""as low as possible without losing staff"".  Staff will move to a competitor who offers slightly higher wages.  A competitor who didn't have to pay corporation tax could offer higher wages without affecting their profit.  Corporation tax is therefore lowering the amount available to pay staff.  Hence corporation tax is also paid in the form of lower wages for workers.

Shareholders are always held up as the ones who should pay.  You do realise that most ""shareholders"" are pension funds?  Lower payments to shareholders means lower payments to pensioners.  You do also realise that share ownership is competitve in itself?  If you offer a lower dividend per pound, then shareholders will move their money elsewhere.

Your comment is written such that you're simply offering your opinion as if it is fact.  When I said ""it is well documented"", it really is... I didn't just offer my opinion.

What you say is true, in a sense, it is perfectly possible for payments to shareholders to be reduced without it affecting the prices or wages.

Don't know the reason, but every other person's consciousness that was also stored in the hard-drive was able to come back out. They never say she died, only that she was dying, meaning that her body could still be there (though it would still have the illness). She also could have found another body, in The Doctor's Wife the TARDIS' consciousness is transferred to a body, so a similar thing could have happened here. 

And the events in SitL/FotD did happen way ahead in the future. River Song's diary contains many stories of her adventures with The Doctor though he doesn't realize they have happened.

I haven't seen the ad the OP refers to, and by the sounds of it I don't disagree with it, but I suspect this problem will need to be tacked from several different angles: to educate potential and actual offenders on consent and show them the effect of their actions; to educate potential victims on how to reduce the risk they could get attacked (such as not incapacitating oneself through alcohol or drugs, as demonstrated by the 60-70% of attacks involving intoxicated victims in the two reports mentioned); and finally (and probably most difficult) find a way to prosecute rapists while avoiding miscarriages of justice.

My point is that those things will take ages. Re-educating public perception about one night stands and the role of alcohol etc, plus changing legal framework will likely take decades. 

I don't see how you can say it isn't realistic to reduce the risk when you just said that the area of consent isn't clear and many guys don't even believe they are raping a girl in the first place. That usually occurs when the girl is too drunk to give a clear yes or no and seems to be going along with it. I'm saying that by not being too drunk in the first place, that situation is avoided because there is zero confusion. That's not appointing blame and I'm not saying practice chastity, wear a burka, only drink water... I'm just advocating a bit of caution and practicality in those situations. Just like we tell people not to flash their cash in the pub.. it doesn't condone mugging or theft, but you can avoid the situation by doing a few things differently.

I don't want girls to get raped at Christmas parties while they are drunk. Obviously, the idea of that happening is absolutely horrible and it's crazy that it probably happened last night and will happen again tonight.

true,alshaw,null,null,"""Marriage equality"" in the way you are using the term is an oxymoron.

Since marriage is, by definition, a heterosexual arrangement, it is impossible to create equality between it and other arrangements which do not contain its essential components (namely sexual intercourse and procreation.) 

Civil partnerships, by contrast, provide a rigorous framework within which two individuals can gain security and legal protection, without the need to redefine an unrelated cultural institution (marriage).

As for homosexuality not existing in open society, I'm sure you are aware of these historic precedents, during which ""marriage"" continued to be defined heterosexually.

IB is for people unable to work due to injury/disability, DLA is there to assist with increased living/care costs, regardless of employment status, as a result of disability/injury (i.e. in the case of my mum - severly visually impaired, can't drive a car, has to take public transport - therefore entitled to a free bus pass). She has actually worked full time for most of her life.

&gt;If that's you evidence that the poor/disabled are being ""targeted"" (as opposed to general cuts that affect almost everybody) then you may as well say the government is targeting her personally. 

Sure, it's anecdotal and not completely representative. But is every single claimant not being re-assessed for fitness for work under tests deemed 'extremely flawed' by numerous disability groups? Have the assessors (ATOS) not been exposed by whistle blowers numerous times for having 'targets' for finding people fit for work? If that's not targeted, I don't know what is.

Furthermore, the article states that his reason for being asked to leave is not that he was working, but that his student visa was only valid for one collage that ceased to exist (i.e. even though they knew he was doing paid work, it was not the work that was the visa issue).

Some people would prefer something more metropolitan in which case I could recommend Manchester, Birmingham or LSE. But for me York was perfect.

true,emericuh,lfcflame,,"Last night in the chat room, I objected to a few people who claimed Stoke were playing ""ugly football"" and this post makes me feel vindicated in that regard. Simply put, our transition times between phases of play was atrocious and Stoke's was superb. 

I've said that Raheem Sterling can often remind me of Shaun Wright-Phillips. Incredibly quick down the flank, but once nearing his own touch line, often runs out of options and puts in a poor or unnecessary cross. I think where Downing found so much joy last week was by allowing Johnson to make those runs down the flank, while he curled inside, arriving in or around the box, giving an outlet to an otherwise pinned down Johnson. Stoke, however, was able to press so high up the pitch that this strategy broke down and none of out wide players got much luck. Efforts to move through the middle were let down by the poor movement and touch of Shelvey, who was simply woeful. As the tip of the midfield spear, his distribution to players coming in to attack needs to be sharper. I would have liked to have seen him swapped for Henderson or Allen, who could have swapped with Gerrard, who seems to link up with Suarez far better and can hold up the ball long enough for other players to arrive.

So I really don't think you'd have to worry about people asking Who is this bitch. They did a good job explaining who Sarah Jane is without making new Whovians feel lame for not knowing already.

And then for bringing old people back, I for one think its actually weird they don't.

I have a huge itch for him to run into himself and then be like oh shit and hide. Doesn't have to be a story, it can just be he stumbled upon a previous episode, oops, turns around a d continues on his merry way. I think it would really make the whole time travel thing more realistic and just be like a cool time travel gets complicated moment.

I think Levy does absolutely try to find the best deal on a player even if its not a exact fit to what we need.  A couple years ago we all were screaming for a big time striker to compete in the CL, Levy grabbed VDV (not a true match), Last season in January we all screamed for a striker and degensive coverage and Levy got us Saha and Ryan Nelsen. this year we all wanted a deep sitting CM and a winger for coverage and Levy brought in Moussa and Dempsey.  So Levy's moves can be hit or miss (like most chairmen to be fair) but he has had some successes when he goes bargain hunting and it would be hard to argue that Sneijder wouldn't be an addition that would benefit the team both in terms of play and as a statement of intent.

Would still love to get Mouts, but with a 26m pricetag (his reported buyout clause) i think it is smart for Levy to look around and price out some other options even if they aren't the exact fit for what we need.",0,1356624424,null,0,false,0,c7mt9sy,t3_15in0d,t1_c7mt9sy,t1_c7mt1sv,null,1430782615,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

He's shifted from the left wing to CAM to CM in a 4-1-4-1 at Bremen, so it seems he's being groomed, intentionally or not, for a deep midfield role - sort of similar to how many of us thought Oscar would end up. I'd rather see KDB deep than Oscar though, KDB seems much less of a defensive liability. Comparing KDB to Lampard, it seems Lampard is still a more solid defensive option as KDB gets dribbled past a lot more and gives up more fouls, but to his credit, he will get stuck into tackles more often and is capable of making as many interceptions as Frank.

The TARDIS was beat up on the outside in TATM but it looked like the Doctor and River were trying to clean her up before the bad thing happened. Pretty sure the inside was alright but I sort of remember the doctor coming outside when they first landed in the graveyard using a fire extinguisher but I might be confusing it with a different episode. If I remember correctly the TARDIS was still pretty torn up on the outside in the shots on the cloud in the Christmas special. I'll double check when I get home from work if I still have them on my DVR.   Granted I don't think this would be reason enough for a remodel as it was apparently working alright at the end of TATM.

You cannot though. A very small amount of politics is to do with ones ability or suitability for the position. I mean, take a sample of politicians and check their qualifications. A fairly standard route is in a PPE degree - how does that straightforward non-scientific position prepare someone to be a science and technology minister? How can they disseminate the reams of technical information they **should** need to be able to do their job properly? 

The answer is that they can't, and that the reason things are the way they are is because our political system selects for a particular kind of person. There's a tremendous selection bias-like effect where one of the major defining factors is the university you went to and the people you know. 

I suspect it's much more important to choose a university with a history of producing politicians (that will be one with an active debates and political societies) than to choose a university that will give you the best education: so whilst you can go to a university outside of oxbridge and still get that economics degree, the truth is you're already at a massive disadvantage because of other factors.

So let's say Starbucks sells 1,000,000 cups of coffee for £1 each.

It spends £100,000 on coffee beans, pays its staff £100,000 and spends £700,000 on intellectual property - it has made a profit of £100,000, upon which it should be taxed.

If the supplier of the coffee beans is owned by Starbucks USA, however, we should say ""sorry, mate, that's not a business expense, we're going to treat it as profit"".

Likewise the intellectual property - the labour of the staff is the only thing which the coffee shop has been obliged to buy at market price, a price which it has honestly negotiated.

Everything else the coffee shop has bought from itself and thus dictated its own price - therefore it should be taxed on earnings of £900,000.

If the coffee shop buys its coffee from a different supplier then it should allowed to claim the beans as a business expense, paying tax on earnings of £800,000.",0,1356630190,null,0,1356630424,0,c7mur5l,t3_15ij0f,t1_c7mur5l,t1_c7muhmw,null,1430783316,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

That is absolutely not true, and in fact can't really be much further from the truth. 

Try to pick one thing in your room just now that was produced in some important way by a politician. This conversation should really be textbooks long, but suffice to say there will be precisely zero items.

We can't mess with that without breaking various international agreements. (Btw I'm reasonably certain costs for direct materials cannot be claimed as a write off, this is more of a vat area).

All I can say is have a look at the ""arms length"" rules for transfer pricing. It enforces market prices by expecting the internal markets to operate similarly to the external markets.

Total points differences:

SWA 1 6 7

TOT -3 4 1

WBA 6 1 7

WHU 8 2 10

WIG -3 -5 -8

WOL is WHU, BOL is REA, BLB is SOT

So  what I've done is calculated 2 things: the difference in points in home matches and the differences in points in away matches for each team. I can add these and get the total difference. Thus, Tottenham is 3 points worse at home this year, 4 points better away, for a 1 point difference overall.

Moffat said he went back and forth and back and forth on the ending, and I don't think he made the right choice.

&gt; The bear cub was purchased from a hunter for $20 by Canadian Lieutenant Harry Colebourn in White River, Ontario, Canada, while en route to England during the First World War. He named the bear ""Winnie"" after his adopted hometown in Winnipeg, Manitoba. ""Winnie"" was surreptitiously brought to England with her owner, and gained unofficial recognition as The Fort Garry Horse regimental mascot. Colebourn left Winnie at the London Zoo while he and his unit were in France; after the war she was officially donated to the zoo, as she had become a much loved attraction there.[3] Pooh the swan appears as a character in its own right in When We Were Very Young.

It would be the merger of the Doctor's dark thoughts and his darkside.

Then there would be an episode where the Doctor and the Master worked together to stop some evil plan concocted by this newly formed Valeyard and upon the success of stopping him the Master turns on the Doctor, kidnapping the Valeyard and breaking the Time Lock to return the Valeyard to Gallifrey and bring about the trial to steal the Doctor's remaining regenerations.

Or it could even be a series long arc centered around the Valeyard with the penultimate episode about the Master and the Doctor working together. Of course they would have to get someone that looked like Anthony Ainley to play the Master, unless a future Master handed the Valeyard over to the Ainley Master at some point.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; You say that on the worldwide web, which was created in Cern and based on an internet that was pioneered by DARPA in the US.

None of those people were politicians; they were and are scientists. Politicians did not have the idea to create the internet. Good ideas will happen without state involvement - sometimes they will come faster, sometimes slower but the key is that entrepreneurs are much more efficient than the state can ever be. 

&gt; The funding, maintenance and existence of everything that makes all of this would not be possible without the state and the government.

Nope, this is also untrue. The extreme majority of all innovation and tangible progress happens without state involvement, but this is a much bigger discussion that probably neither of us have time for. 

Also, as someone that is part of the academic system I can categorically say that the government involvement (that is, the funding bodies) is mostly a farce. Government funding bodies for science provide funding not based on merit, but based on things that make them look good by whatever the metric of the day is- for instance, there can be a demand or expectation for some number of scientific publications, with zero regard for the real quality of value of the work. 

&gt; You're also suggesting that technological progress, not social, political or economic progress is the only way we can move forward but that's entirely different.

I'm using technological (and the economic progress that derives from it) progress as an example of how it's possible to be dramatically more effective for the advancement of society doing almost anything other than politics. 

Anyway these discussions are far too big scale to have in single posts on reddit. I think it's nice that you're interested in politics and the political process but before you get too settled in, I implore you to keep your mind open. Don't shut out ideas on the blind basis that they conflict with your pre-disposed ideology- always question and test your own beliefs. Read that introduction to public choice theory I linked in a different post. Initially you probably won't agree with much of what is being said, but it's important to be aware that these kinds of factors are in play.

Then there's the Master. In Deadly Assassin, he's used up all his regenerations and is a walking corpse. When we next see him, he steals a new body that he uses for a number of years, then he gets exterminated and steals another body. At some point after that he gets another body (The Professor Yana version) which has at least one regeneration in it.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_egoism

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism

Altruism requires you to **NOT** expect or desire any reward for helping others. 

However, by 'making a public sacrifice' for charity, you're gaining recognition and personal gratification. It's the 'Ooo look at me I've donated to charity' scenario.

People who donate altruistically to charity do so without gaining anything in return. They just donate to help out their charity of choice. They don't mention it to anybody, they just do it and move on. 

They don't do it to obtain social standing, increase their self worth or anything like that. This is what people who get sponsored are doing. Whether they like it or not, they will get direct or indirect benefits from being sponsored so it could be argued that they aren't giving out of altruistic feeling alone.

One, as many others have stated, that regeneration limits were imposed by Time Lord society. (While ""Time Lord"" is used for the species, it's interesting to consider that it's also a *title*, and so the regeneration limit is somewhat akin to term limits.)

Second, and what I haven't seen much of, and based *entirely* on my own speculation, is that a Time Lord doesn't get a fixed amount of regenerations, but a reserve of regeneration energy. It's enough for 12 regenerations if all goes well (either without spare use, or some small allowance for it). The Doctor has manipulated his regeneration energy on at least two occasions I can remember, and River once. 

Spoilers, I guess? But nothing too major.

Tennant expelled the remaining regeneration energy after being shot by a Dalek into his severed hand. (I'm not counting regrowing that hand, as that seemed to be a side-effect of a total regeneration.)

Smith used his regeneration energy to mend River's broken wrist.

River used her remaining regenerations to save the Doctor.

I would think that the regeneration limits were originally arbitrary, to allow the Doctor to regenerate but not make all Time Lords quasi-immortal. At 12 regenerations, they may have just assumed that the show would have finished its run before that ever posed a problem.

It hasn't, so now it is.

I don't think anyone capable of rape (and I know to include those that aren't necessarily vile thugs, but those who would take advantage of another person when put in the situation) would really be stopped from doing so given this film.

I too don't like people that make a big deal of being offended, but I find the advert quite insulting. The one I saw was placed in an advert block on 4music (a Freeview digital channel) at about three the morning on the night of Christmas day during a break for Balls of Steel Australia. 

The reason I take insult is that in the same way adverts for children's toys are placed into ad breaks during children's television (the advertising is *targeted*) and accident or PPI claims ads are during daytime TV Dave, PickTV or Really in order to reach their target audience, does that mean the Home Office thinks because I'm watching Balls of Steel Australia at three in the morning mean I'm more likely to be a rapist? That's how it feels when you boil it down this way. 

The stuff about every man being a rapist is an argument for feminism forums and I don't want to go into it, but because I'm a person who enjoys rather lewd trashy TV like Ball of Steel, they better let me know not to commit a heinous crime. Like I stated in my thread, should they start putting anti benefits fraud adverts on the daytime block alongside the PPI claims and the Accident Direct? It's insulting because it feels something like class discrimination. They'd never bother to stick this advert in a block between something like Gok Wan's Fashion whatever or the X Factor. Correct me if I'm wrong and I quite possibly am. It's just the way that I saw the advert and the context in which it was presented to me left me feeling, I think rightfully, insulted. 

Shall we stick anti tax evasion ads on More4 between showings of The Upper Class Build A Big Fucking Mansion With All Their Money (I like Grand Designs or whatever it's actually called too, but it really does have a different target audience)?

EDIT: The fact that the actor was a young male approximately my age wearing clothes that I would wear is a factor too. I don't know if these adverts are a series, but I want to see one where a lewd old Civil Servant or politician uses a position of power or their station to commit sexual assault while drunk on copious amounts of Moet et Chandon. Then I won't be insulted.

EDIT: Kindly go back to SRS too please.

I would guess that instances or sexual assault are just as likely in the context of work with an abuse of power or station and even by type of people who probably okayed this campaign in the first place. I bet more sexual assault occurs between married couples than in a situation like this.

true,oookiezooo,null,null,"I've been doing this for 3 years or so, if you have any specific quests then ask away but here's an outline of my route (although I now realise that I know very few of the road names!)

I cycle down the Abingdon Road to Redbridge then through Kennington. You can bypass Radley by ignoring the left hand turn into Radley and carrying on down the country lane (Whitehorse road? Or Packhorse or something to do with horses). When you get to the junction you have a choice, straight on and you can take cycle route 5 and avoid the roads into Abingdon, but it can be muddy, dark and it takes longer. Alternatively turn right then left at the roundabout to Abingdon, there are cycle paths on the pavement the whole way.

To avoid the hill I take the cycle route down the side of Waitrose and into Abingdon. You've got a number of options from here, each of which have positive and negatives (let me know if you want specifics) but I go down St Helen's Street then left at the church to ride along the river. Take the left after the bridge down to St Helen's wharf. Just keep going straights and the cycle path (currently flooded) will take you past the sewage works (nice) and onto the road into Sutton Courtney. Left at the end, then right at the main junction takes you all the way to the Didcot end of the park.

The whole thing takes me 45 mins to 1 hour.

On the way home I stick to the roads around Abingdon and so follow the one way system, but its possible to get off your bike and cross the roads to retrace your morning route.

The most dangerous points are the road from Radley to Abingdon which is dark and the cars are fast, the rest of the route is honestly a pleasure.

Like I say, let me know if you are considering a different route and I will tell you my thoughts, I've tried them all!

Firstly, don't let your letter lines end on other letters unless you're using them as dual lines; the top line on the P is ending on what should be the S, giving it four lines and therefore invalidating the letter as the most a letter can have is three lines. If the line went straight through to the inner boundary circle it would be fine (but I'm guessing maybe that letter wasn't supposed to be a P).

Same problem with your F on the second word. You have a line hitting the R, but no letter can have both dots and lines.

Joe's a world class keeper, but his rare mistakes are magnified when the offense doesn't pull its weight

Any decent HDTV/projector will inverse telecine any 1080i film source back to 1920x1080 progressive frames, then display it at the TV's native resolution. A good 1080i film source will look sharper on a 1080p HDTV than on a 720p HDTV (assuming you are sitting close enough to the TV to see the difference).

Fully interlaced 1080i (live video sources like sports and the news) have to be deinterlaced in some fashion. Smart deinterlacers will maintain the full resolution in non-moving areas but will fall back to half (vertically) resolution in moving areas. This is one reason why much sports (ESPN for example) is broadcast at 720p.

All the processing going on makes it impossible to predict what will look better on an HDTV. You have to try both options with different sources and you have to know what defects to look for. For me, on my system...the 1080i looks much better.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Of 2012 based on how players performed:

                           Reina    
    Johnson      Skrtel              Agger        Enrique
                        
                  
               Henderson            Gerrard


    Maxi               Bellamy                   Sterling
            
                              Suarez


Henderson has proved he has a very good passing range in 2012, Sahin technically should be the best player to fit Alonso's role but we haven't seen enough of him yet. Bellamy provided some important goals last season, was good over the deadball and like Sterling is pacy and can beat defenders. Lucas didn't play much in 2012. Maxi, Suarez and Bellamy linked up very well on the rare occasions they played together. Sterling has been a revelation this season. The back 4 speak for themselves really, Skrtel has chipped in with a few goals. Agger finally looks settled and free from injury problems. Johnson and Enrique have often been our most creative players. Reina's had a tough season but can still produce really important saves and useful distribution. Gerrard seems to step up when we really need him too and is looking in much better form in recent games. Allen misses out because I feel he hasn't made a worthwhile contribution this season. Wisdom, Shelvey and Suso have a lot of learning still to do. Kuyt's final season was kind of an anti-climax, we really could have used a 14/15 goal season from him under Dalglish but he just couldn't deliver. Carroll was unfairly expected to live up to his pricetag, Spearing wasn't a solid enough cover for Lucas, sold us out a coulple of times in the FA cup final as well. Downing's first season was very forgettable. Charlie Adam was a very good player of the ball for us but didn't provide any defensive stability. Carragher and Coates haven't played many games in 2012 either though a special mention has to go to Coates for a brilliant goal against QPR. Brad Jones has probably provided the biggest impact with the least amount of playing time so I feel it only fair to give him special mention also. /walloftext

Previously, policy makers would try and tax high amounts from the rich in the hope it would raise extra tax revenue but this didn't work. So Laffer developed the curve to show that setting policy of absurdly high rates isn't effective. And now, particularly in the US at the moment, the Laffer can be used to show policy makers that revenue isn't being maximised and so a hike in tax (to what extent is unclear) would move closer to the 'sweet spot' as it were. 

Of course, it is only an estimate and this is a given because Economics isn't an exact science. But we can estimate people's reactivity to tax to a decent degree which can help set the optimal level of tax. Also, we can estimate where we are on the curve to find whether we should raise or decrease tax i.e. perhaps in a specific industry e.g. coffee shops perhaps?

then why did you say

&gt;""the majority of rapists are men""?!

&gt;Any figures or sources to go with that baseless accusation? Thanks for stereotyping an entire gender.

Most rapists are men (conviction rates are really one of the few reliable sources we can use for this) The US is one of the few countries (maybe even the only one) where more men are raped than women, and this is because men rape other men in prisons.

&gt;The Justice Department now seems to be saying that prison rape accounted for the majority of all rapes committed in the US in 2008, likely making the United States the first country in the history of the world to count more rapes for men than for women.

Your source says **nothing** about conviction rates for men vs. women in **any crime** it just says that women are more likely to have mental health issues and parental responsibilities, and that judges were advised to take that into account. Absolutely nowhere in your linked article doesn't say that 'women are probably less likely to get convicted', especially when you don't even mention a crime.


&gt;and men are probably much less likely to report a rape, and in fact may not even see it as such, especially given there are no targeted ad campaigns regarding rape of men!

Men are not 'probably' much less likely to report a rape, please try and at least back it up. 1 in 4 women will be sexually assaulted in their lifetime, and, from a recent study,:

&gt;**Of the college woman who are raped, only 25% describe it as rape.**
&gt;**Of the college women who are raped, only 10% report the rape**.

Here's some more stats:

Look at these conclusions from several sources (it's American, but I think the data can be extrapolated) :

&gt;**60% of male college students “indicated some likelihood of raping or using force in certain circumstances.”**

&gt;Men in fraternities appear to engage in more non-physical coercion and use of drugs and alcohol as a sexual strategy than do independents.

&gt;Every 21 hours there is another rape on an American college campus.

&gt;90% of all campus rapes occur under the influence of alcohol.

&gt;**Men are more likely than women to assume that a woman who drinks alcohol on a date is a willing sex partner. 40% of men who think this way also believe it is acceptable to force sex on an intoxicated woman.**

&gt;**Alcohol use at the time of the attack was found to be one of the four strongest predictors of a college woman being raped.**

&gt;**43% of college men admit using coercive behavior to have sex, including ignoring a woman’s protest; using physical aggression; and forcing intercourse; 15% acknowledged they had committed acquaintance rape; 11% acknowledged using physical restraint to force a woman to have sex.**

&gt;College rape victims receive external physical injuries in over 47% of all rapes.

&gt;**Of the college woman who are raped, only 25% describe it as rape.**

&gt;**Of the college women who are raped, only 10% report the rape.**

&gt;College women are most vulnerable to rape during the first few weeks of the freshman and sophomore years.

&gt;**One in twelve college-age men admit having fulfilled the prevailing definition of rape or attempted rape, yet virtually none of these men identify themselves as rapists.**

&gt;34% of completed rapes and 45% of attempted rapes take place on campus. Almost 60% of the completed campus rapes that take place on campus occur in the victim's residence, 31% occur in another residence, and 10% occur in a fraternity.

&gt;3/4 of off-campus rapes and 7/8 of on-campus rapes involved perpetrators who were known to the victims.

&gt;**78% of the men identified (as rapists) were an acquaintance, friend or boyfriend of the victims.**

&gt;Most rapes occur on the weekend

The oldest trick in the book is to sign your assets over to a limited company with yourself as the director, then pay yourself dividends from the income. For example, if I owned a few houses and took rental income from them, I could simply create a new holding company called Galerath Homes, and pay myself all the money that comes in as Dividends. The company pays no tax because it has no profit (all the money goes straight to dividends) and I pay the flat 20% rate instead of whatever I'd pay if I took it as income. This is a perfectly legal way of making a lot of money and it's very common. 

In fact I did a quick search to try and determine average dividend income of the most wealthy people and I got pages of sites recommending ways to change income into dividends specifically to avoid tax.

I am Scottish by way of Cornwall).  I had one week where I had interviews everyday and was called back for a final interview on the day I was meant to sign on (I have been offered the job) I rang them to say I couldn't make it in, they said they would write to me with a new date... No letter arrives.  I eventually chased it they said they had cancelled my claim.  So in 2 months they paid me £91.. Yes £91 !! But to add insult to injury they rang the CSA told them I am signing on and they want £5 a week from my benefit.... So lets say thats 8 weeks thats £40. Out of £91 they think you can live off £6 a week !!!! To put this in to context the bus fair to the job centre to sign on is £5.10 return.... Its a fucking joke !!!!!!!!

To use the curve to do that don't you need to know at what tax rates the maxima (unless you somehow know the maximum is unique) occur? And how would you? Maybe I'm just mis–informed but I didn't think that anyone had a way to work out the exact shape of the curve. I'd love to see a citation for how to do that, if there is one. 

It always seems that right–wingers tend to be convinced that rates are to the right of the maximum and left–wingers that they are to the left without anyone really giving any solid reasons why. So the Laffer curve in practice seems mainly to be an impressive sounding bit of theory to use to justify an ideological position.

Meanwhile, whether or not the tax rate applicable to coffee shops is too low or two high turns out to be a second–order effect. They'd have to start paying tax before we'd have to worry much about at what rate :)",0,1356653221,null,0,false,0,c7n1666,t3_15ij0f,t1_c7n1666,t1_c7n0g6e,null,1430786411,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It's a fact that the government must make cuts to spending/services for the long-term good of the country. Unfortunately, it's also a fact that the poor are the ones who most heavily depend on government support. Therefore, it's an unfortunate fact that the poor will be those who most feel the effect of cuts. However, the cuts are designed to minimize this effect as much as possible, so it's not fair to say that the poor are being ""targeted"".

I don't know why the Home Office targeted this campaign at young people.  Maybe they put more thought into than we did posting on a dumb message board and conducted studies that found that young people were morel likely to commit this sort of rape, or were more receptive to the message, seeing how they were putting money in to it.  I don't know.  Personally it seems like a good idea to aim it at young people who are new to and exploring their sexuality, but that's just personal speculation i have no evidence to back it up.

Whatever their reason, you give the impression you have a victimisation complex and you're trying to distract from the issue at hand by making up this class conflict thing.  People in our demographic **do** commit rape, and just because there aren't a thousand ads showing every possible situation rape can occur doesn't mean they can't tackle this one.  That's not to say they can't have a ""anybody can be a rapist"" campaign showing the situations you describe, but for whatever reason the people behind the campaign decided this was a good use of resources, and as they are probably a lot more informed on the issue than you and I i'll defer to their judgement.

As for why there aren't ads telling people not to avoid tax, i think the distinction is that that is a calculated ""cold-blooded"" crime.  The people who do it are thinking rationally and chose to do it.  The entire point of this advert is that the rapist isn't thinking rationally and in the heat of the moment doesn't see what he is doing as rape.  The tag line is ""If you could see yourself would you see rape?"", it's asking you to take a step back and consider your actions.  Again though, i think you're just trying to distract from the issue.

true,zewm426,tardis,TARDIS,"Honestly, you'll get a better perspective of the re-launch if you start with 9. The great thing about starting at 9 is you get to see two regenerations and it gives you a better idea of who the doctor is as a being. He's been through a lot of stuff and it's worth seeing and catching things from the beginning. It's always great to actually get references to earlier episodes as opposed to them flying over your head. As an example there is an episode where something happens with the ninth doctor and then later when the tenth doctor comes in they kind of make a joke about it. I don't want to spoil it, but I'm just saying that there might be things from previous episodes that will make more sense in the newer ones. 

Lastly, if you don't watch starting from Rose you will 1) Miss out on the most amazing companion ever. 2) You'll miss out on Captain Jack. 3) ROSE. Rose will make you fall in love with the show.

Anyway, it's a show about time travel and so it makes sense to see what he's been through in the past in order for you to have a better understanding of who the doctor is and why certain things mean so much to him. Like his relationships with his companions and all the people he's saved.

Also, there are certain story elements that happen to the 10th doctor that are extremely significant to the 11th doctor. It's hard to explain without *spoiling* anything. You should definitely watch starting from Rose S1EP1 of the relaunch. The episodes were not filmed in HD so for the first few seasons it looks really bad.

I disagree, bond yields are fine, spending is not a dirty word in a recession.

I think you're confusing 'facts' here with 'policies'. It is a policy of reassessing benefits for tens of thousands of people which is needlessly affecting the poor. Closing tax loopholes or even simplifying tax policy would likely save as much and would hurt nobody to any extent.

&gt; it's very clear that a significant number of welfare recipients are cheating the system and it's right to do something about it

Lets focus on the MPs cheating the system first eh? You're just reinforcing the stereotype of middle class people who think they understand what it is to be poor.

true,AgentUmlaut,null,null,"The harsh reality is while it's good to be building a strong young gun system by fielding the kids in games like this, we can't rely on them 100% to be playing the vigorous demanding pace of the EPL. 

Is it a sign of good work and a job well done when we put in the younger players and get a positive result? Absolutely. Unfortunately experience and being a veteran is needed to edge out the other team for the win. Especially when you have to deal with a bully/hard hitting defensive side such as Stoke. 

I don't mean to bash any of the younger players, because as I said, it's a quality investment, it keeps the momentum going for future seasons, and (if needed/there are rifts among the squad) we could sell that player for a nice sum. 

I just feel that this upcoming transfer window, we're going to need someone who is completely 100% ready to rock and be hungry for that win when things are looking bad. That kind of ""refuse to lose"" hunger that you could see in past players like Dirk Kuyt and Craig Bellamy. 

That being said, I don't think we should be calling up Anelka, Drogba or Raul(or other respected older quality player), but we need to find someone who can get the job done and is creditable for the position they're playing. Obviously Liverpool has had a nasty habit of buying players ,playing them out of position and having a bad time.

**Longish TL DR** Can't go wrong with our approach and inclusion of younger players, unfortunately if the kids aren't 100% at the speed of the EPL, that leaves us open to taking a turn for the worse. We cannot rely so heavily on younger players. Lastly sign someone experienced but not ancient in January that can get us a goal, inspire the team, and blend well. Joe Cole isn't that person, clearly.

true,mallardtheduck,null,East Midlands,"&gt; I disagree, bond yields are fine, spending is not a dirty word in a recession.

Clearly you have a very simplistic view of the economic situation. Spending on things like infrastructure is a useful thing to do to shore up the economy in a recession, and the current government is doing that (actually finding funding for the wild promises made by the last government in it's final days), but to pay for that, cuts have to be made elsewhere, or you just increase the deficit.

&gt; I think you're confusing 'facts' here with 'policies'. It is a policy of reassessing benefits for tens of thousands of people which is needlessly affecting the poor.

A policy that is a direct consequence of the sharp rise in the number of people claiming disability-related benefits. i.e. a rational response to evidence that the system is being abused. Sure, the execution of it has been less than perfect, it was rushed, which is never a good thing in government.

&gt; Closing tax loopholes or even simplifying tax policy would likely save as much and would hurt nobody to any extent.

Effectively raising taxes might be a good short-term win, but in the long-term it just discourages business from investing in the country. Additionally, for every business that is making huge profits through tax avoidance, there are others who are relying on the very same ""loopholes"" just to stay afloat. Getting tax right is _hard_ and you clearly have a very simplistic understanding of it.

&gt; Lets focus on the MPs cheating the system first eh?

You mean like the massive reform of the MP's expenses system we've just had?

&gt; You're just reinforcing the stereotype of middle class people who think they understand what it is to be poor.

I grew up in a single-parent household, entirely dependent on benefits. I know what it's like. I think you're assuming an awful lot about me. There are definitely areas of the government's approach that I don't agree with; e.g. the annual ""Christmas crackdown"" that's been going on for many years smacks of 'let's punish the families who do a little cash-in-hand work to improve Christmas for their kids'.

&gt; Yes welfare fraud does exist, no it doesn't cost any significant amount of money.

I disagree. There's good evidence that it does cost significant amounts of money. It's also not just fraud. There are also problems with the welfare structure that mean that some people see little/no benefit to working even when they are perfectly capable of it.

&gt; Practically every one of these new tory policies has failed miserably because they're based on faulty premises. This is why the poor are being targeted, because you are ignorant of the reality of the situation.

I think your political allegiance is showing here. Cuts are being made across the board and virtually everybody is feeling them.

true,fiyarburst,null,null,"Whoaaa. So obviously there are similarities to the Doctor and the Valeyard, but here's some speculation. Stop me if this has been done before.

The Dream Lord is the Doctor's darker side somehow projected through the TARDIS or something; the Valeyard is a darker side actually embodied. The Valeyard seems extremely similar, and appears between the 12th and 13th regenerations.

So the first mention of Amy Pond possibly being pregnant and not being pregnant at the same time is in the Dream Lord episode in series 5. 

The baby, Melody, gives her regeneration energy to the Doctor in ""Let's Kill Hitler"" so he can regenerate despite the Judas poison. [The jury's still out](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Regeneration) on how many regenerations the Doctor has left. River she gets mad when he uses regen energy to heal her in ""The Angels Take Manhattan"". This suggests it's somehow limited. 

The Silence kidnapped and messed with Melody so she could kill the Doctor. 

What if *River was created by the Dream Lord* to facilitate the Doctor's death, and in doing so, bring about the 12th regeneration and the manifestation of the Valeyard?

EDIT: Just found [this speculation](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/xg23r/the_silence_solved_spoilers_seasons_56/) that suggests that the Silence might also be a creation of the Doctor. IT JUST MAKES SENSE

true,oag721,smith,Smith,"Well, they aren't like either. There are instead many more eras and many more interpretations (which is why I love DW, because it had its own history). I'd say they are closer to Moffat in spirit (wacky, ambitious adventures) since RTD gravitated towards invasion stories and companion background/relationships. But here is the general layout of the classic series:

The First Doctor: There is a balance of sci-fi stories and pure historicals, which are set in the past and have no sci-fi element. The stories can be slow and sometimes long, but personally I like their ambition. Try to think of it like a stage play. The majority of the first two seasons exist and I recommend watching them to see how it all begins. Barbara and Ian are great companions; Susan was underwritten (lots of screaming) which is why her actress decided to leave at the beginning of the second season, and she is replaced by the vibrant Vicki, who is far more enjoyable and must be the most underrated companion. Highlights include *An Unearthly Child*, *The Daleks*, *The Aztecs*, *The Dalek Invasion of Earth*, *The Romans*, *The Chase*, and *The Time Meddler*.

The majority of seasons 3-5 don't exist; they were wiped by the BBC, though they exist in soundtrack/audio form, which some have put to telesnaps to make reconstructions. I'd recommend watching the existing serials if you want, especially *The Gunfighters*, *The War Machines*, and *Tomb of the Cybermen*. *The Tenth Planet* (the first Cyberman and regeneration story) all exists except for the last episode, and it is rather essential.

The Second Doctor: Introdced in season 4. Troughton was famous for having the ""base under seige"" monster stories, and unfortunately most of them are missing. His last season does branch out a bit. Along with Ben and Polly, he picks up the headstrong Scot Jamie, who serves as his partner-in-crime for the rest of his tenure. Ben and Polly leave at the end of season 4, and season 5 features Victoria (who unfortunately reverts to a damsel in distress), followed by future space cadet Zoe in season 6 (who is far more competent). Recommended serials: really anything that exists is worth watching because there is so little, but especially *Tomb of the Cyberman*, *The Mind Robber*, and *The War Games*.

Third Doctor: The color reboot, and following *The War Games*, he's exiled on Earth and stuck working with UNIT. The stories become a bit repetitive at first (they branch out later) and sometimes are too long or rely on heavy social or political themes, but it remains a consistent era. Pertwee also made the Doctor more of an action man, getting rid of the need for a male companion, though the wonderful Brigadier and others at UNIT are usual around. Season 7 is a bit more adult-ish and contains the scientiest Liz Shaw--the more equal companion to date--while 8-11 make an effort to appeal to the family. Season 8 also features the Master, and he makes more appearances in seasons 9 and 10. Jo Grant was less bright than Liz but also helpful and charming, and she is intended to grow up as the series goes along. Season 11 introduces Sarah Jane Smith. Recommended serials: *Spearhead from Space*, *The Silurians*, *Inferno*, *Terror of the Autons*, *The Claws of Axos*, *The Daemons*, *Day of the Daleks*, *The Curse of Peladon*, *The Sea Devils*, *The Three Doctors*, *Carnival of Monsters*, *The Green Death*, and *The Time Warrior*.

The Fourth Doctor: You know, the one with the scarf. He actually occupies a few eras. The first is the famous ""Gothic horror"" era, generally regarded as the high point, and lasts from season 12 to the first serial in season 15. It primarily features Sarah Jane (who is great) and sees the intro of Leela, who is probably the strangest and most violent (and, in, scantily clad) companion. Harry Sullivan of UNIT also travels with Sarah and the Doctor in season 12, the stories of whch run together. Recommended serials: *Robot*, *The Ark in Space*, *Genesis of the Daleks*, anything in season 13, *Pyramids of Mars*, *The Deadly Assasin*, *The Face of Evil*, *The Talons of Weng-Chiang*, *The Robots of Death*, The Horror of Fang Rock*. I haven't seen much of this era yet, so there could be more. And these might be out of order.

Next is the more humorous era, from the rest of season 15-17. This is where K-9 joins. Season 16 contains linked serials which form the ""Key to Time"" quest. I wouldn't say any serial stands out, but it is all rather enjoyable. The Time Lady Romana is introduced here, and is one of the most equal companions to date. Her first incarnation is played by Mary Tamm (season 16) and the second by Lalla Ward (17-18). Season 17 is generally regarded as being silly, but Douglas Adams' *City of Death* is a standout. I haven't seen enough of seasons 15 or 17 to make recommendations.

Season 18, the last of Tom Baker's, sees the beginning of John Nathen-Turner as producer. He tried revamping things in season 18, though I haven't seen enough to make recommendations. It has the E-space trilogy, saying goodbye to Romana and hello to young alien geniuses Adric and Nyssa. The final two serials lead right into the beginning of...

The Fifth Doctor: Continuing in a more serious vibe. I have not seen that much yet, aside from the stretch of *Kinda* to *Earthshock*, all of which I recommend. His final story, *The Caves of Androzani*, is also very highly regarded. Season 20 also features return monsters. For the most part Five is a father figure to Nyssa, Teagan, and Adric. Unfortunately, they seem to just tag along and Teagan and Adric occasionally grind nerves. Later comes Turlough and Peri.

The Sixth Doctor: Probably the least favorite, he was intended to be unlikable at first and become the Doctor we know, but due to production reasons this was never realized, and he just comes across as unlikable. His first season has 45 minute episodes, the highlight of which is said to be *Vengeance on Varos*. His second season forms the story arc ""The Trial of a Time Lord"", which had varying degrees of successful execution. It also (sort of) sees the demise of Peri and the introduction of Mel.

The Seventh Doctor: His first season is leftover stories with lots of crazy ideas an generally really silly stuff, if legend is to be believed. However, new writers turned it into more serious storytelling with a more mischievous Doctor in the famous final two seasons. While the stories are sometimes over-stuffed with ambition, they bring the series back to form. Ace is also a fantastic companion. The final two seasons are probably best watched together, and I am currently in this process and so don't have much to recommend. But I really enjoyed *Remembrance of the Daleks*.

I grew up during the Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker era (Doctor 3 and 4) so I'm probably biased.  I still think those are the cream of the 'old Who' era.

Peter Davison (5) is ok, but Doctor Who gets kind of stale around that time until the 'reboot'

Colin Baker (6) was reportedly an ass in real life and I think it shows in the show in retrospect.

Sylvester McCoy (7) didn't have a lot of work with, but he did ok.  I don't find anything too memorable about his time as The Doctor.

Paul McGann (8) was super exciting when the TV movie came out.  We all thought Who was coming back in force.  Sadly it didn't happen and we had to wait a few more years.  I think the TARDIS looked awesome in it though.

I'm seen very few of the Hartnell/Troughton (1 and 2) episodes so have no real opinion on them.

but individuals will make up their own minds and sometimes have solid friendships, and alliances, despite what their culture or location of origin would have them do. 

The Doctor is very much one of those characters, where whether he's a good guy, or whether he's a bad-scary guy, depends on whether he's on your side or not. He's been through, but also done, some things that if we look at them from a bit of a distance, in a very general way, looks really really scary and horrific.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I had a similar experience - applied for engineering but my extracurricular stuff was largely musical and theatrical. As I've said before in threads like this, you've got two separate goals - firstly, to get an interview, and secondly, to get an offer based on that interview. Extracurricular activities are largely useful for the first goal, but much less relevant for the second. If you impress in the interview, they'll probably give you an offer, and if you fail to impress in the interview no amount of extracurricular material will save you. For you, I'd recommend you write the fuck out of your personal statement. Engineering isn't something you study in school, so you can get away with having little background. Write a personal statement about all the things that interest you about Engineering, review it a week later, get a friend to go over it and tell you which bits suck, repeat. Polish the hell out of it. Honestly, it sounds like you're a pretty solid candidate, so you stand a good chance of getting an interview, but don't be tempted to assume that you'll get one just because of your grades - Cambridge has to turn away 4-A students every year, because there just aren't enough places for everyone. Your personal statement is your best weapon for making an impression. Extracurricular stuff is nice, but it's really you the candidate that they're interested in, and a well-written personal statement is much more indicative of your character and intellect than a line saying you were in the model aircraft club.

So that said, I guess I'd recommend reading up on things that interest you to prepare - there's not really a solid list, but it'd be a good idea to investigate the areas of engineering that really interest you. You'll do a lot of different stuff in first and second year, spanning civil, electrical, information and mechanical, so look up some industry leaders in each of those and read about cool projects they're doing. I won't list lots here, but there's plenty of cool engineering projects happening right now, and if you want some pointers I can help out. Find something you think is fascinating, and read up as much as you can on what's involved - Wikipedia is a good starting point, but see if you can get any of the cited sources out of a library if you're interested. 

As far as what the course is like - it'll seem like you're doing a lot more work than everyone else for the first couple of years, but really it's just very apparent what your workload is. Arts students often end up doing more work because their courses are much more open-ended - in Engineering, if you do the work you're set when you're supposed to, you're guaranteed to do OK. Third year is when the fun really starts. 

I had a friend who went on the MIT exchange - he loved it, but be aware that you'll have built up a lot of friendships with people over the first two years who will graduate at the end of third year, so there's a bit of a danger that you can go away on the exchange and come back to find all your friends gone, and you've missed the fun they all had without you in their final year. Not to dissuade you - just be aware that that's a possibility. Apparently MIT is great.

Shooting birds like pheasants and grouse is also popular (and legal), and deer are shot by gamekeepers and hunters but these are nowhere near as controversial because the kill isn't seen as cruel and the animals tend to be eaten by people afterwards.

The state is far too big and I really do put much of that down to this idea that the state should pay for everything and everyone.

We're left with this system where the working poor are forced to pay high taxes and then they're able to claim some of it back through benefits, if they're lucky, while the workless poor are just given a wage on a plate and not expected to do anything for it. Then you have the lower middle class who get hit with huge taxes and almost nothing in regards to benefits. It has created a sort of benefit dependent class slightly bellow the working class.

People need to learn that work pays, the world does not owe you a living and that in order to find opportunities you must first look for them.

This isn't some ""out of touch"" Tory attack on the poor, it's simply common sense. I see no reason why I should work only to have my money taken from me and given to someone who does not work. I see no reason to support a man who will not help himself.

true,serosis,null,null,"The Dream Lord is a projection in the same sense that in Inception, Mal was Cobb's projection. The Dream Lord manifested out of the Doctor's guilt and hatred of himself for things he has done in his past, manifested through the help of the psychic pollen that was activated after being caught in the time rotor.

The Valeyard is a physical projection of the Doctor's dark side brought on by who-knows-what, either on purpose to expel his evil or extracted by the Master to serve as a way to finally defeat the Doctor.
An example of physical projections in the past are Cho Je and The Watcher, both oddly enough show up at the end of the 3rd Doctor's and the 4th Doctor's incarnation respectively.

I assume the Doctor has either one or two more regenerations, depending if they decide to say the metacrisis Doctor is a full regeneration or not. I will not be surprised or disappointed if/when they find a way around it.

The Silence theory is definitely interesting, but I will wait to see if that is how it pans out. I would like it if the Silence were working alone on this, it has been awhile since we had a new big bad that was thinking for itself and not run by the usual suspects.

Your second edit is what I am trying to close the gap on, simple fan-wank that can satisfy old fans and new fans alike. As the Valeyard is being manifested either by force or by the Doctor's own will the Dream Lord takes advantage of the situation and combines with the Valeyard.

The education budget is relatively small anyway and not much a burden on society, it wouldn't be a problem for even a small state with low taxes to deal with.

People really should be open to a private healthcare system or at least some major reforms in healthcare though.

Because Sarah Jane was exceptional. Think of it this way: how many past companions have reappeared in the show after her? Jo Grant (*Death of the Doctor* doesn't count)? Turlough? Teagen? Nyssa? Peri? Mel? Ace? Jamie? Leela? Romana? Liz? Zoe? Victoria? 

I mean, at some part you have to stop paying lip service to the classic series and tell your own stories. I don't want new Who to be a revolving door of classic actors. Davies made great use of Lis Sladen (in ""School Reunion"", anyway). I don't doubt for a second that Moffat and his successor(s) will similarly open the door for a role being reprised. But don't do it simply for the sake of wanking the classic series. Do it if you've got a story to tell, like ""School Reunion"". 

&gt;I have a huge itch for him to run into himself and then be like oh shit and hide.

I think there are probably theoretical laws and limitations that prevent him from encountering his past selves again. 

&gt;be like a cool time travel gets complicated moment.

Jeez, hasn't Moffat made it complicated enough for you? :P

* Still think the Europa League is a waste of time and we should be either playing squad players or kids in it.
* Glad to be out of the League Cup (or whatever it is called now), see above.
* FA Cup, more time for kids unless we face a decent side.

League:

* Worried Chelsea/Arsenal are likely to improve the second half of the season, will be close with these two. WBA will drop off. Everton could continue if they keep players fit/don't sell during January, they've usually improved post xmas if anything.

Form:

* We struggle breaking down defensive teams. Against Stoke we started pushing too late and didn't create that much tbh. Was similar against Villa but the possession eventually started creating pressure/chances. Teams are happy for the draw and want to take away our play on the counter, we need to get that first goal.
* Regarding this I think Sigurdsson could be part of the answer. Thought he looked really off the pace at the start of the season but worked well off the bench the last few weeks. Needs to start creating in that area outside the box when teams have men behind the ball.
* I would however be reluctant to drop Defoe in his current form. Which is a shame as I'm not sure Defoe/Sigurdsson as our front two would work that well with our Bale/Lennon putting balls in to the box.
* Defensively we've been terrible for the first part but in recent weeks it has got a lot better. Having Lloris settled is a great thing and hopefully when BAE/Kaboul come back they can continue this.

Squad:

* I don't see that many areas we really need another player.
* A lot of people talk about another attack minded midfielder but it would be hard to fit another in to the squad and have everyone happy. Obviously if top talent like Sneijder wants to come you make room, but currently we have good options. Moutinho is another name linked and many people think he's a panacea to AVB's tactics but a good manager should be able to work with good players.
* I think Parker will become invaluable if not a first choice player. Many are forgetting he's more than just a defensive player and was considered one of the best box-to-box players in England a few years back. We can play him with Sandro and Dembele with the latter pushing forwards a lot more and Parker providing the link (think Yaya Toure last year).
* In attack we may need another striker (and Ade may be going, who knows). The original plan was to rotate three for one position, with the third being a young player not looking for a lot of time, but we've played two up a bit now and we don't really even have a young third option.

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"&gt; I almost stopped watching the show when he took over. I feel like everything he does is so predictable. 

I feel that more *now*. One thing I don't like about Clara is that she seems to be *yet another* space-time complicated companion/female character, after two *years* of the ups and downs and wibbley and wobbley of Amy and River. Moffat gets a good idea, then drills it like he's prospecting for oil. 

&gt;And I'm not saying make it a revolving door, I just think that with a show about time travel there should realistically be more moments where they at least glimpse past companions, like when he saw the ponds for a minute in the mall during the episode with Craig.

They weren't ""past"" companions in that episode :P I know what you mean, but Amy and Rory were still very much part of the show. Their departure in ""The God Complex"" was in name only.

But I think that works best for companions from the new series because those are the characters the audience would recognize. That's why Martha, Rose and Jack could make a number of return appearances. That's also why, despite the Doctor checking in on *all* his companions before he regenerated into 11, we didn't see it - obviously because it would have been too cost-prohibitive to film all that, but because it wouldn't have resonated with most of the audience.

Oh, sure, it would resonate with *us*, those who take to the Internet to debate minutia back and forth. Most of the fanbase doesn't do that, though.

Besides, casual glimpses can be distracting. If the Doctor is rushing through the streets of London to stave off an impending alien invasion, it wouldn't make sense for him to stop dead in his tracks, say, ""Hey, I know that person!"" and then keep going. I know that's not what you're saying, but that what it'd boil down to. 

It could be realistic, sure - but it could also be more realistic if the Doctor landed in other countries more. ",0,1356670997,null,0,false,0,c7n5izm,t3_15hbjc,t1_c7n5izm,t1_c7n5eej,null,1430788476,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Similar situation with Parker, I don't see why rumors of him leaving are flying about. AVB has made it clear repeatedly that Parker is an integral part of the Spurs squad. Fairly sure he has a plan for him. I can't see BAE going out as well, we don't have a freaking left back and Jan doesn't like playing there. AVB knows this, and once BAE is 100% fit, he's sure as hell going to play that position.

With Clara, I know it's a bit of a repeat of the River idea, but this time I'm actually not sure how he's running with it and its like the first time since Moffat took over I've actually had to sit and think about an aspect if the show and try to puzzle something out, which is my favourite part of the show.

true,TiberiCorneli,lfc68,,"&gt; FSG will not be investing further funds until a manager proves his transfer policy and team vision.

I don't think they will at all. It's late and I'm too tired to go spend hours digging for all the old articles but there's plenty out there, stuff on how they were impressed with Arsenal's model, quotes from (I think) Henry about they don't want to be doing ""deficit spending"" etc. etc.

I legitimately think FSG has us living purely on revenue, and is going to keep it that way for their tenure. If the club is only making a £30m profit, congratulations, we only have £30m to spend all season. The trouble is in order to generate the kind of revenues we would need in order to be successful, we would first have to be successful. 

This either comes from having the right manager and, unless we're really lucky, being patient with them or from investment, which doesn't appear to be forthcoming. So the question becomes is Brendan the right man? I'm inclined to think he is, but I'm not inclined to think Fenway will be patient with him. They want that top 4 spot. They want that sustainability. Henry himself said winning the FA Cup on top of the League Cup wouldn't have kept Kenny his job (although I do think giving Kenny the sack was the right move tbh).

The Europa League is literally a second class competition. People go on about 'champions league quality' ties but they aren't. If they were, the teams would still be in the CL.

Being in it is a hassle. AVB talks about it being an opportunity for a trophy, which is it. But in Portugal they play 8 less league games a season and their cups are shorter. If we play the same players in the league and then mid-week they're going to tire, or worse get injured. 

What we should be doing with both it and the League Cup (and ironically is one of the things that has made Arsenal so strong the last few years now you mention it) is using it as an opportunity to help players adapt to our system, so when they're put in the first team they know what they're doing. The only good thing about playing everyone in the EL so far this year is it's a new system for all our players, and while they've struggled at times it has probably helped a little.

If just *one* person posted just *one* type of thing (ie. a pic of a sonic screwdriver), then people could use the oh so repeated excuse of ""just downvote it and move on"" and people wouldn't mind too much. But when that turns into a flood of the same things over and over again, that's when it's gets annoying. People leave the subreddit or miss the important posts.

Whenever we have posts like this, we usually also have comments mentioning a new important piece of news (such as the news about Neil Gaiman writing another Who episode a few months ago), which is almost always followed by another comment by another user thanking them for posting it because they missed it in the ""flood"".

So we brought in the repost rule. But then, *for the very low-effort content*, why should one person be allowed to post something anyone could have and not the rest? What are the boundaries supposed to be between ""acceptable"" and ""not acceptable""? Where do we call it a day?

People are having problems reading and understanding the rules anyway, so we find that having clearer rules would be easier than having ones that could be ""got round"".

Most of the gifts people have received for Christmas, are mass-produced items from places like ThinkGeek and BBCShop and Forbidden Planet. The point of the subreddit is to find out stuff. What's stopping people from just having a look at a list of items at these places or through a google search? Why do we need a submission for practically each and every item (and some items more than once)? 

I've mentioned my mod style before in a previous post quite recently so I won't do so again, but as I see every post that is submitted here, I think I've got quite a good eye as to what gets repeated. We do let some merchandise posts in, and these are the rare ones or the very new ones that we haven't seen before. 

&gt;I've never been in charge of a large group of people like this

Again, mentioned this recently too. It's a huge subreddit and part of the subs are screaming one thing in one ear and likewise with the other. It's hard to keep the balance right and as a user put recently, ""the mods absolutely can't win"". So personally, as long as what people think is worded constructively, isn't insulting and is civilised, then I'll listen to it. Otherwise and honestly, I don't care about them. I don't get paid to do this. It's something that I do in my free time that takes up a lot of time (mostly because people can't read the rules).
