- knocked down buildings.
- reduced lanes for cars.

Note that althoguh dutch cycle lanes are great, this is absolutely daft. Only car accident I've ever witnessed is in Holland, two cars on one of these roads, light rain, head on crash, one car ends up upside down in the river).

While I'd love there to be more cycle lanes where I live (Canterbury), I can see why they have such problems.

- Most roads are already one lane each way, so no realistic prospect of taking away lanes from cars.
- Cannot knock down privately owned and often historic buildings.
- Pedestrianised main street through the town, but didn't put in a cycle route so you can't cycle through it; probably because of the hoards of tourists would just get run over all the time.
- Alternative route runs through a shopping precinct and the council sold the land to a private firm, so the streets aren't publically owned there so no hope of a cycle track.

Benitez realised that his qualities were better suited as a holding midfielder, and that's the position he started to play beside Mascherano. It took Benitez and his own hardwork to get him where he is today. 

The initial scouting has nothing to do with his current success. Liverpool were lucky that we got a player who was humble enough to work hard at changing his role. 

He currently plays in the same position for Brazil as he does for Liverpool.

There is also a public holiday left at the end of this month which (depending on your finish date) you may/may not be entitled to.

true,spoonmonkey,null,null,"Credit cards are good things if you use them sensibly.  A track record of having credit, using credit and paying it off promptly is definitely good for your credit score.

So credit cards basics: you can spend on the card up to your personal credit limit (chosen by the issuer when you get the card, and they generally reassess every year).  Each month you must pay back a minimum amount (something like 5-10% of the total balance).  You are charged interest on any money left on the card.  The interest is generally higher than a long-term loan, but a bit lower than those quick cash pay day loans you see advertised on TV.

You can use the card to withdraw money - like a loan - but be warned normally you are charged a higher rate of interest on that.  Never use this facility except in emergencies, it's not worth it.

Credit cards are better than debit cards for most transactions, because they offer stronger consumer protection.  If you ever have a dispute over a transaction, just contact your CC provider and they'll cancel it in your favour.

Probably the best way to use your CC is in place of your debit card, certainly for all internet transactions, and optionally for all real world transactions too.  But **treat it like a debit card or cash**.  Never spend more than you can afford, always pay it off the same month.  That way you'll get the consumer protection, and you'll get the good credit history, but you won't get yourself into debt.

Do not ever look at your credit card and think it's free money.  It's okay to use it once in a while to carry a bit of debt if say you have sudden unexpected expenses and then pay it back over a few months.  It'll cost you in interest, but it's not the end of the world.

I have a credit card but I pay it off in full every month. That really doesn't do anything for your credit score because you aren't *borrowing* the money.

Whereas, by spending on the card, then repaying it, you're showing that you can reliably make monthly payments, thus building your credit score.

Your credit score matters for things like a mortgage, car loan or mobile phone contract. It's also linked to lots of other things such as your address. If you've lived in one place for a while, that's a good thing. Trying to get credit while living in temporary student property or a new house is much worse because the address often has a bad history.

&gt;Shouldn't we also be pedantic about it not representing the Welsh?

They are intended to be represented under the English flag.  Everyone knows they aren't really happy about that, but it's not a point of pedantry, as it has been addressed.  Also, it's irrelevant, and a new thing you just injected to the debate for no reason.  Why did you write this sentence?

&gt;Certainly before we worry if people should be waving it one way or the other.

Oh I see why.  Well, like I said, there is genuine history and culture behind which way the flag flies, whereas the Wales thing has already been addressed.  Wales are technically represented on the flag, and the flag is technically often flown upside down.

I often find the ""there are more important debates to be had"" response a bit annoying tbh anyway.  Seriously, you could shut down just about any debate with that response.

You are indicating that a person who is not damaged or hurt by a case need the same support as someone who is severely physically injured and mentally controlled by the events. This is a straw man argument. 

To start with the support needs and processes involved in supporting a male victim are very different to those needed for a female victim. So using the same resources would be inefficient and ineffective.

Men are much much less likely to seek or need help for these issues then women. The issues they seek help for would be very different (child care inequality etc).

Treating issues with different needs differently is not sexist its rational.

What does being in the shadow of Xabi Alonso or Mascherano have anything to do with this? He wasn't good enough as an attacking midfielder. He became a good defensive midfielder.

To top it off he passionately loves playing for LFC.

I understand his move would bring in transfer funds, but does any sane person really think that £20M would actually buy an *upgrade* from Agger?  I know he is injury prone, but LFC are pretty stacked with central defenders to cover for him.  You might be tempted to say that with the depth available, let him go.  But Agger is a *proven* success here at the club.  Plus, he *broke a rib* and still finished a match last season.  That is not the quality of an average footballer!

29 appearances per season for the past 4 seasons isn't very injury prone. Injury prone is Hargraves, or Wilshere, or not recovering from an injury like Anderson. Nobody refers to Gerrard as injury prone but he has missed more games than Agger. Agger hasn't had a large recurring and he has recovered from injuries as a better player, that isn't 'injury prone'.

He is one of the top defenders in the world, especially on the ball, and he can not be replaced. Even improving replacements are being quoted at 40M Eur. We need to do everything in our power to retain Agger, and that includes matching salaries with what City are offering.

I have completely supported every other sale or possible sale the club has made, but you don't simply give away one of the first names on the team sheet, one of the foundation of the 'new' team and one of the best ball-playing defenders in the world.

If we could afford to give a group of muppets on average 6-figures in salary, each of who barely featured in the squad and are now difficult to get rid of, then we can certainly give Agger a 6-figure deal. 

There is no consistency in the line of thought here - first 'lets give Acqua a chance', who is on 125k and has failed, failed, failed, but lets sell Agger for 20 and bring in an inferior version of him who might not work out for the same money. seriously, wtf.

There are two things we need to change at LFC this offseason:

* stop giving signings, especially idiots, large wages (cole, acqua, maxi, bellamy, etc.)

* instead spend those wages on retaining the best players we have

She'd have stood a better chance - and done other participants on these programmes a favour in the process, if she'd argued that they're not fit for purpose in their current form. The programmes should be geared up in such a way that placements can be proven to be useful to customers, by benefiting them for the future. So yes - if you want to get into retail, a placement at Poundland / other retail company would be ideal. But if you want, for example, to work in admin, then clearly it's not.

As for the notion that somehow, as a graduate, such a job is above her? I'm sorry I completely **disagree.** Yes, of course she should have been sent on a programme / placement that would allow her to use her skills and qualifications [hence why, imo, she went the wrong way with this appeal.] but had there been no other placements available?

Obviously I have fuck all clue about the medical likelyhood of something like that happening again, so any theory I am making is based on his medical history not his likely medical future.

What it comes down to in the end is what's of more value to the squad a good CB who is going to make 30+ league appearances a year or a world beater who may make 30+ or may make 18 if he's lucky.

Double-decker, high capacity trains make it much cheaper to move people around the country (and transport large numbers of bikes). No hills mean no tunnels, and no tunnels means you can make bigger trains.

The ubiquitousness of cheap bikes and ease their use has in part lead to the development of the cycle network. Very few bikes have gears; they don't need them. This means the bikes themselves arn't very valuable, are much easier/cheaper to maintain and rarely get stolen (they are mostly identical anyway).

Yes and no. Your Expirion/Equifax report does list repayments but only those that are late. For each card they have a table totting up how often you are late e.g. ""2 incidents of being less than one month late, one incident of being 2 months late and one default"". However, this combined with the knowledge of when the account was open tells them everything they want about your repayments. AFAIK they don't note whether you make the minimum payment or more but it does not the overall balance which you can make a guess on this from. 

The UK doesn't have a ""credit score"". They make this data available to the card issuers and it is them that decide your ""score"" based upon the data; this is usually your risk to them. It's similar to your ""profitability"" argument but it's not quite the same.

* The **tide of mass EU immigration** has pushed down wages and restricted job opportunities.  Only by leaving the EU can we regain control of our borders.

* Freeze permanent immigration for 5 years. Immigrants must be fluent in English, have minimum education levels and show they can financially support themselves.

* Free the police force from the straitjacket of political correctness and ‘targets’.

* The law of the land must be single and apply to us all.  We oppose any other system of law.

Role models don't have to be celebrities, whether a photogenic athlete or a stripper who's done well for herself. They just have to be good people and an example of what 'good' is. That could be a local shop keeper, a lollipop lady at a school crossing, a doctor, whatever. Perhaps just someone who keeps a fine garden and does nothing else other than to live with honour.

Part of the reason why the newspapers and TV's are full of shallow reflections of role models is because we're less likely to know the shop keeper, the lolipop lady etc. 

We get into cars or catch the train to go to work and drive miles and miles away from our neighbours, whereas 100 years ago, we'd work with them. 100 years ago, we knew what our neighbours were doing, how they were living. Now we haven't got a clue about the people across the road or next door and our neighbours have been replaced by characters in soap operas on TV, pushing us all even further apart. The character's lives always have more going on than a real person could and that makes our neighbours seem boring. Katie Price has a team of publicists that present an image of an interesting person with an interesting life, with plenty of razzle dazzle.

100 years ago, a kid with bad parents knew other adults who could inspire them that weren't just relatives, but also the guy 5 doors down who was 'good' because they lived and worked together, and there was no TV to replace them. Bad parents rely on the TV to provide entertainment and inspiration for their kids as dayus9 gives a clue to in his comment.

Beacuse we don't know our neighbours, the local shop keeper, the local doctor or lolipop lady other than a nodding acquaintance, we look elsewhere and lap up the fake lives that are presented to us in exchange for money. This is what children have to deal with - a lack of real relationships that might inspire.

As Snoron points out elswhere here in the comments, these fine athletes don't want to take that role, and even if they did, they'd have to do a George Best to compete for attention with Kim Kardiwhatsit for the front page of a tabloid or a reality TV show. Sports people typically wind up on the front page because someone else has had sex with them - that's pretty goddam lame and hardly role model territory.

We now enter the realm of diminishing returns. We have always yearned for gossip, part of the human condition, and we used to get that by leaning over the garden fence, or knowing everyone in the pub. Now the gossip is global and it's far more salacious and exciting than anything the neighbours would likely deliver and it competes to be more and more spicey. Reddit is a perfect example of the best and worst of this.

Exceptions exist, and I'm thinking of the likes of Tariq Jahan (the Brimingham father) or Johnson Beharry - but profound acts of courage or dignity tend not to make headlines as they don't typically generate money like sex does, and therefore children of weak parents don't get to witness them. Even when they do, a child will never form a relationship with that person, find out what makes them tick and why they're dignified or courageous.

How many of us now really know the names of our neighbours five doors to the right and left of our front door? How many of us want to? The chances are that even if we were to get to know them, they or we would have moved house by the time a real relationship could form and children don't get to know the adults close by who can make a difference. 

Great role models are everywhere around us, but the children that need them most have a very small chance of finding them.

Have you never wondered why dressage is the hobby of the wealthy? It’s because training a horse to that level is so bloody hard that the few that compete at that level are as expensive as sports cars.

Dressage came out of the traditions of cavalry riders; the art was to show total synergy between horse and rider to the point where the rider was able to get the horse to perform complex movements with only the most subtle of commands. Training a horse to that level of athletic ability takes years, and can only be done to an international level by a handful of people in the world.

Now I’ve been a big gamer all my life; I’ve never properly competed at national events but I’ve trained and lead clans in FPS tournaments. My younger sister on the other hand is a dressage obsessive; also all her life. There’s nothing very upper-class about my family; both my parents grew up in the east end of London, and we’re now comfortably middle-class.

After finishing her studies my sister wrote to a Dutch trainer, asking to intern at his yard for three months. He was so impressed with her eagerness he gave her free lessons in exchange for her labour. We could never afford to buy a competing dressage horse, so she bought a young Dutch warmblood in a 50/50 share with my parents (she’s been paying back their half ever since).

She’s been training it for five years now, working 50-hour weeks as a waitress to support its upkeep (vets bills on horses this highly strung are a nightmare). Every day she gets up early, feeds it, exercises it, trains it, then spends the rest of the afternoon and evening waiting tables. The horse is huge; massive slabs of mussel cover its frame. The stables she keeps it at normally house race-horses; this thing weighs almost half again as much.

But for all her efforts, she’s not an international horse trainer. She doesn’t have the skills to take it any where further then national competitions.

So don’t tell me gaming is any where near as comparable; ex-games journos like Charile Brooker are talking out of their puckered asses when they come out with stuff like that. Dressage might be one of the dullest sports for spectators ever invented, and it might make a rather easy target for all the class-warriors out there, but to say it requires as much effort as competitive gaming is just rubbish. The level of dedication, expertise and physical fitness required is on a whole other scale.

We are now 3rd in the medal table. Third! Against the US and China. A sign we have wasted treasure on a global phallus measuring contest.

And still we hear people asking for MORE money to put into sport. STOP. STOP NOW. We need scientists, engineers, business people, not cyclists and horsey folk. Chasing superpowers in the wasting money on weird nationalist flag waving is irresponsible.

Unbelievably I hear politicians complaining that too many posh people were winning posh sports. They then claimed the poor lacked experience of competition. Was I hearing this right? The poor that face constant reminders they are losers, that obsess over talent shows and football. Are we going to complain that too few footballers went to Eton?

The poor know all about competition. The problem is they are failing not that they are ignorant of the concept.

Then fitness. If watching sports on television got people fit America would be a sprightly nation of super heroes in civilian dress. Olympics are not going to make this country fit, even if it was on every month. Televised sports are for a professional elite.

But hey propaganda works. Until the hangover.

Our politicians do very little to challenge the public mood of cynicism. We find them to be career minded, lobbyist funded, dubious expense claiming, selfish hypocrites. I'm tired of a lack of integrity being ok in modern politics, it should be challenged whenever its seen. 

&gt;  is it so hard to believe that she wants to be a dedicated mother not distracted by her work, and also live with her husband at the same time?

She was a mother before she became an MP. Every MP since forever has said ""I'm giving up politics for my family"" Mensch has shown her love of the media and has said some quite *repugnant* things for attention and self promotion, I don't trust the press release she's given out of hand because the source isn't trustworthy or reliable.

&gt; and perish the thought that we should have MPs smart enough to kickstart businesses on the side.

The point is *on the side*, when you become a politician your are accepting a duty for a period of time. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't be able to do anything outside of politics but it lacks integrity to abandon the post. ""Family reasons"" is a valid excuse because it stops awkward questions and criticism of the party and the individual. An MP should take shit for giving up their post and the party should select individuals worthy of representing the nation.

&gt; why isn't her husband out buying porn and charging me for it?

Bit of a non-sequitur, I'm not attempting to defend any MPs that lack integrity.

I agree with you that it does all that good stuff, but I don't think it is the role of the state to provide free labour for firms even if they are struggling - if their business model can't pay proper wages than they don't have a viable business. 

Furthermore, surely you can appreciate the massive potential for corruption that this has? As firms can just hire more and more of the workfare people and use them to replace actual paid positions. Indeed, IIRC, there were reports that many seasonal positions over the Christmas period were replaced with workfare in supermarkets (sadly I don't have the source right now).

I would suggest any person visiting the US to eat some authentic Southern US food (not KFC, Popeyes, etc).  It's the most unique cuisine in the US, I would say.  Of course, like all things ""American"" it borrows heavily from other cultures' cuisines.  If you are to eat any one thing in the US, it should be BBQ. I would go to any one of the BBQ centers of the US, whether it be Memphis, Texas, Kansas City, or the Carolinas.  I prefer Memphis, but it's what I was raised on.  The really good stuff is sold out of run-down shacks, not shiny clean restaurants.

There's also Cajun/Creole food, which borrows heavily from French.  Of course, you have to go to Louisiana for authentic.  I don't know much about it, unfortunately since I've never been down there.  If you visit during crawfish season, there's craw-boils.  These are done all over the south, but the crawdads would be best in Louisiana.  They typically occur in backyards, so you would have to know someone.  Basically, it's crawfish, prawns, corn on the cob, sausage, red potatoes, and seasoning cooked together in a big pot, then strained and poured out on a table.  Everyone stands around and eats out of the pile.

Which brings me to my next point.  Beer.  Drink good beer.  Yes, America has outstanding beer.  Any municipality you are in will have at least one microbrew, and any grocery store/liquor store will have a huge selection of brews from around the US.  It's readily available, and offers an amazing amount of variety.  Leave the piss water for the rednecks.

**Programme Skill:**

* Very skilled with Photoshop

**Experience:**

Most of the stuff I create I do for kicks or practice, recently though Ive had people asking me to create small projects for them.
Recently I built a website for a friend who's a DJ and started a local record store and one for a friend of a friend who started a local accounting firm.

**Design practice:**

When I build a website I normal start by creating a mock up in Photoshop, as new ideas develop and fit in it allows me to update the mock up giving us a live idea of what it will look like.

Once approved I then start to build the site which can take between a couple of hours if everything goes well, to a couple of days if im busy or have some trouble.

My level to detail is RIDICULOUS, pixel perfect every time

-----------------------

**Early Design Concept:**

[I created this Liverpool themed website mockup (very basic, early stage)](http://i.imgur.com/1lvcw.jpg) a few weeks ago with the intention of turning it a similar project to this

If other designers working on the project message we then we can start to bounce ideas together and get things rolling

I do recall communist countries that obsessively threw resources into Olympic athletics in a form of political posturing. It never really helped those countries.

We spent many years selling off sports grounds around schools. I can be persuaded it was sensible on economic grounds. But then why do we need to centralise all our sporting efforts on London? The Olympics drained resources towards specialism and away from grass roots activities.

Of course people need to be more active. I'd love to see provision for local sports. But the Olympics are not going to do that. We have plenty of sports coverage the rest of the year yet this apparently does not inspire people?

The redevelopment value of the Olympics looks slight. And London during the boom was the last place in the UK that needed central development money.

In saying that...

I really appreciate the drama and spectacle of the event. The opening ceremony was magical for people. And I say that without cynicism. An occasion like that can touch the soul of people. It has the aspects of religion that make it so powerful, art, collective worship, ritual, transcendent.

Although I don't appreciate sports I can see the utopian science fiction ideal that it represents - that in the future all petty ethnic battles are placed into symbolic games. Now that all material needs are dealt with, we can watch esteemed competitors on giant public screens who devote their lives to perfecting their bodies and talents in recreational games whilst we play harps and study philosophy. I'm not being mean there. I do see the modern Olympics as part of how we might wish the future to be.

But that magic is powerful and I fear as with religion, royalty and nationalism, it can be moved in a way to hide corruption, misappropriation and misdirection of resources.

true,ezekielziggy,eng-sussex,Sussex,"Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg has announced that plans to make the House of Lords mainly elected are to be dropped. Here's his statement in full:

""I support an elected House of Lords because I believe that those who make the laws of the land should be elected by those who have to obey the laws of the land. That is democracy - and it is what people rightly expect from their politics in the 21st Century.

When the Liberal Democrats came into Government, I knew that creating a democratic Lords would not be straightforward. This cause has long been blocked by an establishment resistant to change and by the vested interests who benefit from maintaining the power of political patronage, while keeping the power of people out.

However, Lords reform was in each party's manifesto. It was written into the Coalition Agreement - without argument or controversy. And I had hoped that, with enough compromise and cross-party involvement we could build a consensus delivering it once and for all.

After the election I convened cross-party talks. The Government then published a draft bill and white paper with a clear commitment from myself and the Prime Minister to hold the first elections to the Lords in 2015.

We then established a joint committee, of both Houses, to scrutinise our proposals. We amended the Bill once the Joint Committee reported - taking on the majority of their changes. And, last month, in a historic vote an overwhelming majority of MPs backed an elected House of Lords during the Bill's second reading.

'Painstaking efforts'
However, despite these painstaking efforts the Labour party and Conservative backbenchers united to block any further progress, preventing government from securing a timetable motion without which the Bill effectively becomes impossible to deliver.

At that point, the Prime Minister said he needed more time, over the summer, to persuade his MPs and I, of course, agreed to that reasonable request. Unfortunately, the PM has confirmed to me, since then, that an insufficient number of his MPs have been persuaded to support the Bill.

In my discussions with the Labour Party leadership, they have made it clear that: while they continue to back Lords reform in principle. They are set on blocking it in practice.

Supporting the ends, but - when push comes to shove - obstructing the means.

I invited Ed Miliband to propose the number of days that Labour believe is necessary for consideration of the Bill. He declined to do so. Instead he confirmed Labour would only support individual closure motions - which could bog down parliament for months.

Regrettably Labour is allowing short-term political opportunism to thwart long-term democratic change.

So, after a long process - almost two and a half years - we do not have the Commons majority needed to ensure this Bill progresses through Parliament. It is obvious that the Bill's opponents would now seek to inflict on it a slow death: ensuring Lords reform consumes an unacceptable amount of parliamentary time.

'Manipulated'
Clearly, it would be wrong for me to allow Parliament to be manipulated in this way not least at a time when there is so much else for us to concentrate on.

So I can confirm today that we do not intend to proceed with the Bill in this parliament. The government will make a full statement on this - to parliament - as soon as it returns in September.

To modernisers and campaigners, let me say this: I am as disappointed as you that we have not delivered an elected Lords this time around. But Lords Reform has always been a case of two steps forward, one step back.

And my hope is that we will return to it, in the next Parliament emboldened by the overwhelming vote in favour of our Bill at second reading.

An unelected House of Lords flies in the face of democratic principles and public opinion. It makes a mockery of our claim to be the mother of all democracies. And - even if you put all of that to one side - the ever increasing size of the Lords makes it an unsustainable chamber. It cannot keep growing; reform cannot be forever ducked.

As you know, an elected House of Lords was part of the Coalition Agreement: a fundamental part of the contract that keeps the coalition parties working together in the national interest.

A contract not just to each other, but a set of commitments we have made, collectively, to the British people.

Contract
My party has held to that contract even when it meant voting for things that we found difficult. The Liberal Democrats are proving ourselves to be a mature and competent party of Government and I am proud that we have met our obligations.

But the Conservative party is not honouring the commitment to Lords reform and, as a result, part of our contract has now been broken.

Clearly I cannot permit a situation where Conservative rebels can pick and choose the parts of the contract they like, while Liberal Democrat MPs are bound to the entire agreement.

Coalition works on mutual respect; it is a reciprocal arrangement, a two-way street. So I have told the Prime Minister that when, in due course, parliament votes on boundary changes for the 2015 election I will be instructing my party to oppose them.

When part of a contract is broken, it is normal to amend that contract in order then to move on.

Lords reform and boundaries are two, separate parliamentary bills but they are both part of a package of overall political reform. Delivering one but not the other would create an imbalance - not just in the Coalition Agreement, but also in our political system.

Lords reform leads to a smaller, more legitimate House of Lords. Boundary changes lead to a smaller House of Commons, by cutting the number of MPs. If you cut the number of MPs without enhancing the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Lords all you have done is weaken parliament as a whole, strengthen the executive and its over-mighty government that wins.

'Pause button'
So, for these reasons, I have decided, reluctantly to push the pause button on these controversial parliamentary reforms.

Throughout this process my aim has always been too honour the Coalition Agreement in full - no more, no less. I stood ready - and stand ready - to deliver reforms that are controversial for my party because that is part of a wider, reciprocal arrangement.

That is why, for instance, in a last ditch attempt to keep both sides of the bargain intact, I suggested a solution that would have allowed us to progress with both reforms: a referendum on Lords Reform on election day in 2015, with first elections to the Lords taking place in 2020, while deferring boundary changes to 2020 too.

That would have been in keeping with the Coalition Agreement - in which neither policy had a set timetable. But this offer was not accepted.

So we must now restore balance to the Coalition Agreement, allowing us to draw a line under these events and get on with the rest of our Programme for Government.

My Liberal Democrat colleagues and I remain focused on the urgent task that brought the Coalition together: rescuing, repairing and rebalancing our economy.

And, just as we are determined that this Government delivers economic reform, we are determined to deliver social renewal too.

There are many things that brought me into politics. Many things which animate my party: political reform is one. A fairer tax system is another. Internationalism. The environment. Civil liberties.

But the thing I care about most - the central purpose of the Liberal Democrats in this government - is to build a fairer society. A more socially mobile society, where a person's opportunities do not depend on the circumstances of their birth, where every individual has the chance to flourish.

We will continue with that critical work. We will continue to anchor this government firmly in the centre ground."" ",0,1344271048,null,0,false,0,c5p0e81,t3_xrl9z,t1_c5p0e81,t3_xrl9z,null,1429566929,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

They don't pay them at all, that's the point.  Trainees should get starter-level salaries.  That's what starter level means - it means you're just starting.  If you pay people you get exactly the same thing at the end without exploiting anyone.

&gt; That is 100% bullshit.

Nope.  Businesses do what maximises their profits in the short-term and what they can get away with in order to do so, often at the expense of their own long-term goals.  This isn't some extreme political opinion, it's just true.  You think the recent banking disaster, for example, was due to a couple of honest mistakes?

It's not even a conscious decision to exploit - if you don't, your competition will and you'll end up behind.  The joys of capitalism.

Amoral doesn't mean evil by the way - it just means they don't factor in any moral considerations into their business transactions.

And why have team GB so miraclously won so many golds. Thanks Black Magic-you can do anything. Just 5 months to go and the dark age is finally over. Time to ascend out of duality people. Be at peace-love each other. The real conspiracy is that you are angels in human form. Humanity has been fooled for centuries. Swallow the ego pride and be at one. No child should starve on this planet. Theres enough bananas for everyone.

I made a pretty basic Doctor Who theme for it a while back using Super Boot Manager (I think), but it wasn't all that impressive so I didn't bother posting it anywhere. I'll see if I can still find it if you're interested.
Last time I checked, GRUB only supports background images of a pretty low color palette (somethink like 256 colors IIRC), so I imagine that background image you posted doesn't look all that great. You might want to check out BURG, as it doesn't have this limitation. Not sure how easy it is to make custom themes for it, but I imagine you could just plop whatever background image you want into an existing theme.
As for the sound issue in my splash screen, I recently learned it's possible for QML-based KSplash themes to play the sound themselves (as opposed to the hack-ish method I'm using), which I imagine would be less overhead. I'd like to update my theme at some point to use this method, but I know absolutely *nothing* about QML, so this might be a while.

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"I hope this isn't true, though, because transfer fees still do matter. After last summer's business and our general ""big club"" status, we're going to be forced to overpay when targeting signings. Given that we don't have the financial clout or CL football that the other ""big clubs"" do, we can't afford to overpay; **even if the wages are low, a large transfer fee remains money wasted.**

Secondly, with huge transfer fees come huge expectation. See Andy Carroll.

Lastly, overall wage budget is a better predictor of league finish than transfer fee. So if FSG keep spending large amounts on transfer fees but say ""It's OK, our wage bill is low"", because transfers in/out of the squad for the sake of low wages will lower our chances of getting back into the top 4.

I hope you've misinterpreted FSG's intentions, OP - personally I think that the more significant reason they're offloading Maxi, Kuyt, Aquilani, etc. comes down to value for money; those players don't deserve the wages they were on, with the first two being 30+ and not regular starters (rightly or wrongly), and Aquilani possibly not wanting to be here, injury prone, and/or not guaranteed a starting berth. They'd probably shift Joe Cole too if they could, but nobody's going to be as stupid as we were in signing him (or Rodgers sees something in him nobody else has this far in a red shirt). 

**I think they'd be willing to offer high wages for the right player**, even if it's by giving them a lower contract first and then signing them onto a better one (e.g. Suarez). ",0,1344275194,null,0,false,0,c5p1hra,t3_xrt9d,t1_c5p1hra,t3_xrt9d,null,1429567449,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

It allows them to buy / rent cheap houses and turn every room into a growing area without any of the electrical work being signed off by a competent person.  It allows dangerous people across the country to make hundreds of millions of pounds, untaxed because people enjoy cannabis.  It allows children to buy whatever they want, because the only ID a dealer needs has the queens head on it.  It allows certain dealers to spray their cannabis with glass fibre to bulk up the weight.  It allows growers to not flush their plants so you end up smoking whatever plant growing food's in there.  It allows gangs to murder each other to control turf.  People raiding known dealers / growers houses with violence because there's nothing they can do about it.

It makes sense that FSG want to mimic Arsenal or Tottenham's wage model and greatly limit the amount of 75k+ wages that guys like Andy Carroll, Kuyt, Aquilani, Joe Cole, etc. are on. It's arguably why Meireles didn't receive a new offer of around 70k --we didn't want to create another Kuyt/Maxi situation with an aging player on huge wages.

This statement gets my back up. These schemes do not do a damn thing to help the unemployed get 'real' skills that they actually want. If the government was serious about helping people get real work experience, they would let the jobseeker try to find a position of their own instead of shovelling them onto pointless predefined schemes for businesses that are big enough and simple enough to operate that they should be paying a proper wage or the working hours are limited each week.

Given a jobseeker earns about £71 a week over the age of 25, this translates to, for a normal 37.5 hour a week job, to £1.89 an hour. For someone under 25 that earns £56.25 a week, they would be on £1.50 an hour. I just can't see this as remotely acceptable.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yes I'd say massively safer. There are 9,000 alcohol-related deaths in the UK every year. That's the equivalent of a 9/11 every six months in terms of people losing their lives. There are zero deaths from cannabis.

Aside from killing thousands, alcohol fuels domestic violence. How many hundreds of thousands of women have been hit by their drunk husband because of booze? If those same people smoked a spliff there would be a lot less violence in this country.

&gt; If weed was legalised in this country, everybody would see that as the green light to get stoned everyday because there is no hangovers from weed.

So you think millions of people will immediately take up cannabis because it is legally available. I think you'd find that 95% of people would stick their current habits. As for the kind of people who would get stoned every day, I suspect they are already doing that.

Drug legalisation is inevitable. The politicians all know it even if they won't admit it and public opinion is slowly but surely coming round to it. The first step will be decriminalisation, which has been a proven success in Portugal. South American countries, which have been ripped apart by the drugs war, are demanding change and the US is starting to listen. Prohibition has never worked and never will.

It's because a large number of Scottish voters are of the opinion that their vote doesn't matter because ultimately England has the final say in everything, based on the fact it has a larger electorate. If every man and woman in England voted for the Conservative Party in the General Election, and every man and woman in Scotland voted for Labour, we'd wind up with either a Conservative government, or a hung parliament at best.

What if leaving the EU becomes a larger issue than it is right now? What happens if every man and woman in England wants to leave, but nobody in Scotland does? Then we wind up with a major problem where the two regions are directly conflicted, and it's simply not *fair* for Scotland to be forced to follow what the English want. It's called self-determination: the right of the Scottish electorate to actually see a result to their votes.

He **did** have pace - he looked so lively it was unreal, when he first joined Leeds - but he's the kind of player who just picks up little niggling injuries and after a solid start at Leeds, his first season would ultimately be ruined by these (and a lack of game time, with Snodgrass and Gradel being ahead of him in the pecking order). When he came back last season, he seemed to have lost what pace he had and looked genuinely unwilling to take players on. However, I've always thought that he crossed the ball really well, although he's very one-footed and simply cannot play on the left side on the field.

I completely agree about him being capable of scoring, though. His movement off the ball in and around the box can be really good: I still remember the way he got himself in the box to head in that sublime cross from Johnson against Nottingham Forest, at the City Ground. However, that was while he was playing as a winger in a 4-3-3 system (Grayson changed it to 4-2-3-1 later that season - and 4-4-2 in the following season) and I wonder if that system just suited him better.",0,1344283594,null,0,false,0,c5p3tak,t3_xrtld,t1_c5p3tak,t1_c5p0vpb,null,1429568547,2,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,2

Nope.  But then not every company uses interns either and a lot of the ones that do have plenty of profits.  I'm just saying if you want something, pay for it.

&gt; Furthermore, new employees can often be the catalyst to solve any problems that are present.

If you think this'll help then hire someone, take the risk that it'll improve your company.  Banks are quite keen to loan to established businesses, and minimum wage isn't a ridiculous amount of money.

1. deal with a breach of the peace or prevent it.

3. arrest a person in connection with certain offences.
    
4. recapture someone who has escaped from custody.

5. save life or prevent serious damage to property.

It's irrelevant whether it should be illegal or not and it's your own responsibility to conceal or get rid of it whilst it is.

As someone who has voted Lib Dem and Tory in the past, I have to agree that the Lib Dems are being disingenuous here. Boundary reviews were tied to the AV referendum, not Lords Reform - but having failed on AV Clegg is desperately trying to secure some sort of legacy. I would be happy to see him achieve it, but not at the expense of our democracy - his Lords proposals are just not good enough, and it's disgusting to propose that we should accept a constitutional faff just to salvage a little Liberal Democrat credibility. The sad thing here is that the Lib Dems have no-one to blame but themselves - they were dealt a good hand but played it terribly. They *could* have won AV if they'd run a better campaign, and they *could* have got Lords Reform through if they'd done a better job of building a cross-party consensus. Instead, they've been lazy and unrealistic and fallen back on moral outrage to make them feel better about their political shortcomings.

I don't think difficulty is a fair argument against Scottish self-determination, personally. It's okay for you to disagree, but it's ultimately not your decision, as you don't live in Scotland.

true,LedgeySC,cnty-uk,Manchester,"Wages are not solely dictated by their economy, but also by western companies who are willing to use exploitative labour, as well as those of us who purchase items made in sweatshops. How do you solve this? I think that the best way is to encourage Western companies to raise wages (not to £28,000 a year you tit), give the workers better rights and best of all to petition governments of third world nations to push for better rights for workers (in particular children) whilst assuring them that you'll continue to operate in that country. The reason they're willing to allow exploitation to happen is because they're competing for the presence of company's like Adidas, if they put in a minimum wage then they'd just move to another third world nation. If wages are fine there'd be no poverty in the third world, or anyone who worked in a sweatshop wouldn't live in squalor. Unfortunately that's not the case.  

Also, don't be silly, I never suggested paying them more than doctors and I don't know why you keep suggesting that. You can pay a sweatshop worker more without putting them on doctor wages.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Microwaves are radio waves with wavelengths ranging from as long as one meter to as short as one millimetre, or equivalently, with frequencies between 300 MHz (0.3 GHz) and 300 GHz.[1] This broad definition includes both UHF and EHF (millimeter waves), and various sources use different boundaries.[2] In all cases, microwave includes the entire SHF band (3 to 30 GHz, or 10 to 1 cm) at minimum, with RF engineering often putting the lower boundary at 1 GHz (30 cm), and the upper around 100 GHz (3 mm).

Apparatus and techniques may be described qualitatively as ""microwave"" when the wavelengths of signals are roughly the same as the dimensions of the equipment, so that lumped-element circuit theory is inaccurate. As a consequence, practical microwave technique tends to move away from the discrete resistors, capacitors, and inductors used with lower-frequency radio waves. Instead, distributed circuit elements and transmission-line theory are more useful methods for design and analysis. Open-wire and coaxial transmission lines give way to waveguides and stripline, and lumped-element tuned circuits are replaced by cavity resonators or resonant lines. Effects of reflection, polarization, scattering, diffraction, and atmospheric absorption usually associated with visible light are of practical significance in the study of microwave propagation. The same equations of electromagnetic theory apply at all frequencies.

The prefix ""micro-"" in ""microwave"" is not meant to suggest a wavelength in the micrometer range. It indicates that microwaves are ""small"" compared to waves used in typical radio broadcasting, in that they have shorter wavelengths. The boundaries between far infrared light, terahertz radiation, microwaves, and ultra-high-frequency radio waves are fairly arbitrary and are used variously between different fields of study.

High-power microwave sources use specialized vacuum tubes to generate microwaves. These devices operate on different principles from low-frequency vacuum tubes, using the ballistic motion of electrons in a vacuum under the influence of controlling electric or magnetic fields, and include the magnetron (used in microwave ovens), klystron, traveling-wave tube (TWT), and gyrotron. These devices work in the density modulated mode, rather than the current modulated mode. This means that they work on the basis of clumps of electrons flying ballistically through them, rather than using a continuous stream of electrons.

Low-power microwave sources use solid-state devices such as the field-effect transistor (at least at lower frequencies), tunnel diodes, Gunn diodes, and IMPATT diodes.[3]

A maser is a device similar to a laser, which amplifies light energy by stimulating photons. The maser, rather than amplifying light energy, amplifies the lower frequency, longer wavelength microwaves and radio frequency emissions.

The sun also emits microwave radiation, although most of it is blocked by Earth's atmosphere.[4][not in citation given]

Before the advent of fiber-optic transmission, most long-distance telephone calls were carried via networks of microwave radio relay links run by carriers such as AT&amp;T Long Lines. Starting in the early 1950s, frequency division multiplex was used to send up to 5,400 telephone channels on each microwave radio channel, with as many as ten radio channels combined into one antenna for the hop to the next site, up to 70 km away.

Wireless LAN protocols, such as Bluetooth and the IEEE 802.11 specifications, also use microwaves in the 2.4 GHz ISM band, although 802.11a uses ISM band and U-NII frequencies in the 5 GHz range. Licensed long-range (up to about 25 km) Wireless Internet Access services have been used for almost a decade in many countries in the 3.5–4.0 GHz range. The FCC recently[when?] carved out spectrum for carriers that wish to offer services in this range in the U.S. — with emphasis on 3.65 GHz. Dozens of service providers across the country are securing or have already received licenses from the FCC to operate in this band. The WIMAX service offerings that can be carried on the 3.65 GHz band will give business customers another option for connectivity.

Metropolitan area network (MAN) protocols, such as WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) are based on standards such as IEEE 802.16, designed to operate between 2 to 11 GHz. Commercial implementations are in the 2.3 GHz, 2.5 GHz, 3.5 GHz and 5.8 GHz ranges.

Mobile Broadband Wireless Access (MBWA) protocols based on standards specifications such as IEEE 802.20 or ATIS/ANSI HC-SDMA (such as iBurst) operate between 1.6 and 2.3 GHz to give mobility and in-building penetration characteristics similar to mobile phones but with vastly greater spectral efficiency.[5]

Some mobile phone networks, like GSM, use the low-microwave/high-UHF frequencies around 1.8 and 1.9 GHz in the Americas and elsewhere, respectively. DVB-SH and S-DMB use 1.452 to 1.492 GHz, while proprietary/incompatible satellite radio in the U.S. uses around 2.3 GHz for DARS.

Microwave radio is used in broadcasting and telecommunication transmissions because, due to their short wavelength, highly directional antennas are smaller and therefore more practical than they would be at longer wavelengths (lower frequencies). There is also more bandwidth in the microwave spectrum than in the rest of the radio spectrum; the usable bandwidth below 300 MHz is less than 300 MHz while many GHz can be used above 300 MHz. Typically, microwaves are used in television news to transmit a signal from a remote location to a television station from a specially equipped van. See broadcast auxiliary service (BAS), remote pickup unit (RPU), and studio/transmitter link (STL).

Most satellite communications systems operate in the C, X, Ka, or Ku bands of the microwave spectrum. These frequencies allow large bandwidth while avoiding the crowded UHF frequencies and staying below the atmospheric absorption of EHF frequencies. Satellite TV either operates in the C band for the traditional large dish fixed satellite service or Ku band for direct-broadcast satellite. Military communications run primarily over X or Ku-band links, with Ka band being used for Milstar.",0,1344289227,null,0,false,0,c5p5dr5,t3_xrpcc,t1_c5p5dr5,t1_c5p5b0h,null,1429569273,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Power

A microwave oven passes (non-ionizing) microwave radiation (at a frequency near 2.45 GHz) through food, causing dielectric heating primarily by absorption of the energy in water. Microwave ovens became common kitchen appliances in Western countries in the late 1970s, following development of inexpensive cavity magnetrons. Water in the liquid state possesses many molecular interactions that broaden the absorption peak. In the vapor phase, isolated water molecules absorb at around 22 GHz, almost ten times the frequency of the microwave oven.

Microwave heating is used in industrial processes for drying and curing products.

Many semiconductor processing techniques use microwaves to generate plasma for such purposes as reactive ion etching and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).

Microwave frequencies typically ranging from 110 – 140 GHz are used in stellarators and more notably in tokamak experimental fusion reactors to help heat the fuel into a plasma state. The upcoming ITER Thermonuclear Reactor[6] is expected to range from 110–170 GHz and will employ Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH).[7]

Microwaves can be used to transmit power over long distances, and post-World War II research was done to examine possibilities. NASA worked in the 1970s and early 1980s to research the possibilities of using solar power satellite (SPS) systems with large solar arrays that would beam power down to the Earth's surface via microwaves.

Less-than-lethal weaponry exists that uses millimeter waves to heat a thin layer of human skin to an intolerable temperature so as to make the targeted person move away. A two-second burst of the 95 GHz focused beam heats the skin to a temperature of 130 °F (54 °C) at a depth of 1/64th of an inch (0.4 mm). The United States Air Force and Marines are currently using this type of active denial system.[8]
Spectroscopy

Microwave radiation is used in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR or ESR) spectroscopy, typically in the X-band region (~9 GHz) in conjunction typically with magnetic fields of 0.3 T. This technique provides information on unpaired electrons in chemical systems, such as free radicals or transition metal ions such as Cu(II). The microwave radiation can also be combined with electrochemistry as in microwave enhanced electrochemistry.

Microwave frequency can be measured by either electronic or mechanical techniques.

Frequency counters or high frequency heterodyne systems can be used.

In a laboratory setting, Lecher lines can be used to directly measure the wavelength on a transmission line made of parallel wires, the frequency can then be calculated. A similar technique is to use a slotted waveguide or slotted coaxial line to directly measure the wavelength. These devices consist of a probe introduced into the line through a longitudinal slot, so that the probe is free to travel up and down the line. Slotted lines are primarily intended for measurement of the voltage standing wave ratio on the line.

Further information: Electromagnetic radiation and health and Microwave burn

Microwaves do not contain sufficient energy to chemically change substances by ionization, and so are an example of nonionizing radiation. The word ""radiation"" refers to energy radiating from a source and not to radioactivity. It has not been shown conclusively that microwaves (or other nonionizing electromagnetic radiation) have significant adverse biological effects at low levels. Some, but not all, studies suggest that long-term exposure may have a carcinogenic effect.[12] This is separate from the risks associated with very high intensity exposure, which can cause heating and burns like any heat source, and not a unique property of microwaves specifically.

During World War II, it was observed that individuals in the radiation path of radar installations experienced clicks and buzzing sounds in response to microwave radiation. This microwave auditory effect was thought to be caused by the microwaves inducing an electric current in the hearing centers of the brain.[13] Research by NASA in the 1970s has shown this to be caused by thermal expansion in parts of the inner ear.[citation needed]

When injury from exposure to microwaves occurs, it usually results from dielectric heating induced in the body. Exposure to microwave radiation can produce cataracts by this mechanism, because the microwave heating denatures proteins in the crystalline lens of the eye (in the same way that heat turns egg whites white and opaque). The lens and cornea of the eye are especially vulnerable because they contain no blood vessels that can carry away heat. Exposure to heavy doses of microwave radiation (as from an oven that has been tampered with to allow operation even with the door open) can produce heat damage in other tissues as well, up to and including serious burns that may not be immediately evident because of the tendency for microwaves to heat deeper tissues with higher moisture content.[citation needed]",0,1344289354,null,0,false,0,c5p5eyi,t3_xrpcc,t1_c5p5eyi,t1_c5p5b0h,null,1429569289,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The existence of radio waves was predicted by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864 from his equations. In 1888, Heinrich Hertz was the first to demonstrate the existence of radio waves by building a spark gap radio transmitter that produced 450 MHz microwaves, in the UHF region. The equipment he used was primitive, including a horse trough, a wrought iron point spark, and Leyden jars. He also built the first parabolic antenna, using a zinc gutter sheet. In 1894 Indian radio pioneer Jagdish Chandra Bose publicly demonstrated radio control of a bell using millimeter wavelengths, and conducted research into the propagation of microwaves.[14]

Perhaps the first, documented, formal use of the term microwave occurred in 1931:

    ""When trials with wavelengths as low as 18 cm were made known, there was undisguised surprise that the problem of the micro-wave had been solved so soon."" Telegraph &amp; Telephone Journal XVII. 179/1

In 1943, the Hungarian engineer Zoltán Bay sent ultra-short radio waves to the moon, which, reflected from there, worked as a radar, and could be used to measure distance, as well as to study the moon.[15]

Perhaps the first use of the word microwave in an astronomical context occurred in 1946 in an article ""Microwave Radiation from the Sun and Moon"" by Robert Dicke and Robert Beringer. This same article also made a showing in the New York Times issued in 1951.

Disclaimer: Any of what follows might be inaccurate.

What you have to realise is that if you are riding behind someone else, you ride in their slipstream so don't suffer as much air resistance. You'd think this is marginal, but I've heard people say it's like having a third extra power.

So take the sprint for example. The guy at the front is further forward. But the guy behind can accelerate while shielded by the front guy, reach a fast speed and only then swing out into the air. Also, if you're on the inside, then you have the shorter route, just like the inside lane in athletics. But if you're on the outside, you can use the slope to suddenly accelerate. It can be quite tactical. You may have seen a rider at the back on the far outside, and the rider at the front rides up to match his slope advantage, and then when the front rider isn't looking the back rider suddenly accelerates and passes him on the inside, having accelerated *and* nabbed the inside track. That said, at the end of the day, pedalling harder is usually what decides it. Kenny won being both the front rider and at the back.

The *really* confusing event is the omnium thing. But bear in mind this is the equivalent of the heptathalon in athletics.

true,LedgeySC,cnty-uk,Manchester,"There is most certainly not a lack of industry in places where these companies are sourced, in fact they're going through their own 'industrial revolution'. And China is most certainly involved in this because there's a lot of exploitation there, doesn't matter whether it's 'third world' or not (however, that is debatable. They are a 'developing' nation'). What these nations lack is entrepreneurial ability, in that they either can't afford or lack the ability or financial backing to form their own companies and thus have to look westwards to accommodate their massive industry boom. It's a slightly different case in Africa, but there's is still a lot of exploitation in different forms.

And I said in my second reply: ""If wages are fine there'd be no poverty in the third world, or anyone who worked in a sweatshop wouldn't live in squalor."" The market allows for them to be paid meager amounts but the amount they're paid is barely enough to pay for necessities, which is why a lot of the time a whole family (including children) have to work. If you're going to sit there and tell me that the West has no say in the wage structure of sweatshop workers then you're completely oblivious. I understand that you're arguing that $2 isn't as low as it seems but what you're failing to comprehend is that $2 is still very low. We're talking about companies that earn billions through products made by people of all ages in poor countries at a rate which is incredibly low, despite the massive profits they can gain. How the hell can you encourage a market economy in a country where they have little to no disposable income? Fact is, western economics is not applicable in a third world state or even a developing state. There has to be top-down alteration of wages or an introduction of 

If you're going towards ad hominem and doubting my ability to argue as opposed to the argument itself then I wouldn't suggest that. I'd suggest reading 'Just Give Money to the Poor' which argues that the West is just sitting there tutting at impoverished nations because they're developing at an incredibly slow rate, when in fact it's because these countries and the people in them don't have any money to spend to stimulate a market economy.

true,absolutedestiny,null,null,"Pro sc2 players measure the distance between themselves, their monitor, their keyboard and their mouse. The physical is there as much as it is in a precision sport like Archery or Shooting but on top of that precision and focus there is a lot of thinking.

At the high level, reaction speed and focus are somewhat less of a factor - everyone at the high level of e-sports has those. What they're mostly training on is the actual strategy part of the game - testing build orders and unit compositions until they've refined them to the point that there's no wasted resources and that they are flexible for anything the opponent can throw at them at each stage of the game (x3 match-ups and however many different maps are in the tournament map pool).

They're learning the timings of every unit in the game - how fast they build, upgrade, can get across the map to attack (can I attack before he has X, does he have enough money to be about to build Y to counter my Z). They're working out how to guage an opponent's army with incomplete information and how to hide their own strategy from their opponent. Then, when it comes to maximising your engagement, the speed and focus are vital.

While I think e-sports have a solid place in international competition I accept that the olympics will never be the venue for them and the same is also true for many physical sports.

I'd rather we established the Spring and Autumn Olympics.

But for the benefit of everyone else: you're disgusting.

By choosing to define activities as ""fundamental realities"" or ""recreational pursuits"", you presume to define what is and isn't a right.

You have already claimed I shouldn't have freedom of speech by saying that it's not my right to support a certain football club. You appear to be saying that you're entitled to pass a law that obliges me to attend Fulham matches.

I think that ""fundamental reality"" is a pretty weird way to describe the choice of book from which one selects one's religion, but that's clearly the way you intend to frame things. Thus by saying that religion is part of one's ""fundamental reality"" you can say that it's a human right to use red wine in a church service, or even to attend that service.

If I accept your premise, then you're also claiming the right to say that gay sex is merely a ""recreational pursuit"" and shouldn't be protected as a human right.

I'm sorry, but that's not how it works. You don't get to whimsically decide what is and isn't a right - that's the whole point of them.

We have the right to do whatever we like, as long as it doesn't harm other people. 

In Europe that's worded as the right to a ""private and family life"", which is frankly an awful set of words. It's much better defined in US terms - we have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Yes, it is my right to smoke weed, drink wine, have gay sex or support any football team I like.

Not a very glowing review of a player worth spending 9m on. Granted he did mention that he had a great season last year, and is comfortable on the ball with both feet, and handles wingers well. I just think 9m euros could be spent on a better player (however admittedly I know nothing about this player beyond the OP's evaluation). I do agree that reinforcements need to be brought in at RB without question. I just hope if we plan on spending around 10m euros, we could find someone more experienced/higher rated

 the only way ffp wont level the playing field is if they dont enforce it, but as it stands even sponsorship deals are going to be tested for market value.

To expand upon the prize money - bonuses are awarded for all sorts of things.

1. Marin, I'm not so sure about. I haven't heard any official word that he was injured but that could very well be the case as EnglishMD said.
2. Mikel, Essien, Meireles, Lampard and possibly Ramires all play that role. He's temporarily the third back-up. I don't think they'll sell him but rather loan him to increase his value/get him playing time. Romeu was great for Chelsea last season because he was a U21 player but now he might not be good enough to warrant a spot on the 25 man squad.
3. Possible loan destinations include Southampton and Watford are the only two possible destinations as of this moment (more suitors might come). Don't forget that he was a highly coveted loan property before the loan to Swansea.

@EnglishMD
Did you watch a lot of the Swansea games? Rodgers couldn't sit down a player like Sigurdsson that was performing at an exceptional level. It was really bad luck Swansea took both players on loan because McEachran would have had more than five total matches. 

@ScreamingGerman 
KdB complained about the way RdM was using him. He said that he had never played on the right side and wasn't used to it. It also complained about playing with the reserves. If KdB would have accepted a role on the right side, it is possible he would have stayed instead of being loaned out.

Certainly, I'd like to see a conclusion to the West Lothian Question. I think further English devolution would be great for the people of England, and that more mainstream parties than the UKIP need to start pushing that as a major agenda item; it'd probably win them more votes, at least. That's ultimately not something that concerns me, though, nor would I expect to have the right to vote on the creation of such a parliament.

You cannot state as fact that cannabis causes lung cancer. [The largest ever study of its kind concluded that ""smoking marijuana, even regularly and heavily, does not lead to lung cancer.""](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/25/AR2006052501729.html)

&gt; That paranoid feeling from weed can spill over to your sober mind... if cannabis is abused it could lead to suicide. I'm sure cases like this will have happened, to say no deaths have been caused by weed is ignorant.

Maybe cannabis is detrimental to your mental health over time. Again there has been contradictory findings on this, but there are many things that can worsen mental illness. Whether cannabis is bad for unstable people I don't know but it's not a reason for prohibition.

&gt; to say no deaths have been caused by weed is ignorant

It's not ignorant. It's actually down as zero in the [United States' official list of causes of death](http://drugwarfacts.org/cms/?q=node/30). For you to say I think that weed probably does this or probably that doesn't really hold much water.

However, I am not going to claim that cannabis is entirely safe. No drug is. I was highlighting that compared to alcohol it is relatively safe. What I would say is that you cannot argue for prohibition by claiming that people need to be saved from themselves, especially while more dangerous drugs and activities are legal.

&gt; More people would definitely smoke weed if it legalised, surely that is obvious?

Would they definitely? If that is the case when why are Americans  twice as likely to smoke weed compared to the Dutch. The US has strict drug control whereas the Dutch can smoke weed at their leisure. [Source](http://drugwarfacts.org/cms/?q=node/67)

Even if usage was going to increase, it's not a reason for prohibition. 'We are going to continue to criminalise this group of people because that group of people might be tempted to try this product if it were legal' just doesn't stand up as a reasonable way to run a country.

&gt; Blindly shouting out for full legalisation is moronic though. Cannabis is still an addictive drug (mentally) and smoking it is still harmful to the body. Pretending otherwise is insulting to your intelligence.

I wouldn't advocate full legalisation overnight. Decriminalisation followed by gradual legalisation would be a sensible approach. Cannabis is certainly not addictive like cocaine and heroin but I'm sure regular users can develop a habit.

[This study which appeared in the Lancet](http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/11/drugs_cause_most_harm) compares the damage down to individuals and to others.

If Matt Smith did this, he was supposedly gone for 200 years (Aged 900 -&gt; 1100) we would be wondering what he did.

true,ibpants,1972crest,,"&gt; the only way ffp wont level the playing field is if they dont enforce it

I'm not sure you understand FFP.  It has nothing to do with creating a level playing field and everything to do with ensuring that UEFA's cash cows - the teams with the highest revenues - continue to be successful.

FFP limits spending to revenue, how is that a level playing field when Man U have a revenue of over 300m, while Stoke take in less than 70m?  How can Stoke ever hope to catch up?  This is where people tend to point to the statistical outlier that is Newcastle's 2011-12 season, but I do not believe for a second that a couple of shrewd Bosman transfers and one lucky season will ever be enough to close such a huge gulf in revenue.  Man U will continue to spend their way into the Champions League season after season because they'll have the revenue, while Stoke will only be able to afford midtable at best because **they can't invest in their future if their spending is limited by their past**.

It doesn't bother me.  We have a great squad, great infrastructure, and crucially our revenue has grown massively - FFP will only serve to cement our position as a top club - but no other clubs will be able to crash the party thanks to outside investment because they will only be able spend what they already had.  

FFP does **NOTHING** to level the playing field - FFP tips the balance even further in favour of the established order.  There won't be any more rags to riches stories like City's; no one will be able to afford to crash the party again.  Doesn't that strike you as being bad for football?

true,JB_UK,null,null,"Say what you will about the Americans, but it's extremely impressive they get the return they do by funding elite sport without any public subsidy whatsoever, whereas we spend £100m a year on [UK Sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Sport) (who do no grass-roots support whatsoever, they solely fund elite training facilities, coaching, nutrition etc).

They also managed to host the 1984 LA Olympics [with no public funding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Summer_Olympics#Los_Angeles_as_host_city), indeed with a direct public profit of $200m.

I do think we should be funding sport in the community, for instance local parks, playing fields, swimming and gymn facilities, physiotherapy services, and so on, should be heavily funded, because of the benefits to health and happiness for the general population. But we shouldn't be funding elite atheletes solely for the purpose of flag waving and 'inspirational moments'.

true,rbnc,cnty-wales,Wales. Living in Germany.,"&gt;Hubbs is an ancient Anglo-Saxon surname that came from the son of Robert. In Old English, patronyms were formed by adding a variety of suffixes to personal names, which changed over time and from place to place. For example, after the Norman Conquest, sunu and sune, which meant son, were the most common patronymic suffixes. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the most common patronymic names included the word filius, which meant son. By the 14th century, the suffix son had replaced these earlier versions. Surnames that were formed with filius or son were more common in the north of England and it was here that the number of individuals without surnames was greatest at this time.

This is the only way to get rid of a player who is worth 40k-50k a week yet earning 100k a week, because humans just dont wanna take a significantly smaller salary...

First, technically dollar coins have existed for years in the form of ""Sacagawea dollars"" and various quarter sized ""golden dollar"" coins. Generally these are used as change in vending machines as it is easier for machines to dispense coins over paper. 

Second, the ""paper bills"" naturally act as a decimal point. That is, American's look at the dollar as the most basic unit of money, and coins are fractions of that unit. You can't just change the base unit (never-mind the fact that the value of money is an invented concept to begin with).

If I had to redesign the currency from scratch, I would make it all in units of 10^n and 5*10^n (as per roman numerals). None of these inconsistencies like 25 cent coins but 20 dollar bills.

1. The homegrown rules aren't FFP related -  they are competition related.

4. Moses is being looked at seriously because we don't have a true right-flank player. Brana is slightly suspect offensively and Rami is more a wide-midfielder than a winger. Marin, Hazard, Sturridge, Mata are all naturally left-footed (and hence naturally left-flank or central) players. Same applies for Theo or Hulk.

As for The Doctor becoming a woman or a different race, I'm iffy about that. There would be more pressure on the actor/actress then even before and if it ever happened it would probably be for the sake of creating a big difference rather than the story.

I'm all for a doctor of a different gender or race if they cast the right actor and it fits the story.

Just seem he has strong genes.

One of the things that makes a dog a good fighting dog is an unswerving devotion to its owner and a willingness to fight to the death to protect him or her.  There are certain breeds that can be trained to be either very good or very bad.  The Pit Bull is one of those breeds.  In fact, it used to be called the [Nanny Dog](http://sgbrown.hubpages.com/hub/The-Pit-Bull-Dog-Once-Knows-as-the-Nanny-Dog-What-Happened) because it was so loyal and good with children (although this natural state of affairs has been skewed somewhat by selective breeding for aggression).  German Shepherds are another prime example.  If you're a police/security dog handler then you need a loyal, well behaved dog that will absolutely do what you tell it without question, even if it means putting its own life at risk.  If you tell it to attack another person then it will.  That's not a ""bad dog"", that's a ""good dog"" (in terms of dog training) that's doing exactly what it's been told/trained to do.

TL;DR: It's more a case of the owners being vile.  The dogs are just doing what they've been trained to do, i.e. protecting their vile owner.

It opens us up to being mislead. Imagine a politician campaigning on removing CCTV cameras and makes a show of getting rid of a few thousand cameras, only for them to be from car parking areas while the ones watching regular people remain.

I can't find how the determined it was *directly* caused by cannabis use.  But even with their numbers 2.5% is pretty low.

So basically it's the age old problem of young inexperience drivers thinking they're better than they are, combined with the use of drugs including cannabis and alcohol.

If someone were recommending the best episodes from the new series to someone looking to cherry pick and mostly skipped over Tennant, it would probably be dismissed as a terrible guide.

But from a character and continuity standpoint, if you want to see Tennant you're actually probably better off starting with 9 so you can get more context for him and get introduced to Rose and Jack Harkness, since his story in many ways continues from where 9's left off, unlike 11 who's introduction starts and entirely new arc and so far has only had one major returning character from Tennant's run.

Bear in mind that £264m figure is just for elite olympic sport, so the benefits to society are literally only the medals won. This isn't money to set up sports clubs, run local gymnasia or swimming pools, or build cycle lanes; it's solely to pay for the facilities and coaches which the olympic athletes use. Even in terms of 'inspirational moments', most of the medals come from events which are completely inaccessible to the mass of the population -  13 of 18 gold medals have come in canoeing, equestrian, track cycling, rowing, shooting or sailing.

For context, £264m is equivalent to something like 6% of public expenditure on university tuition each year, or about half of all public money spent on medical research. It's nothing to sneeze at.

Edit: I should clarify that 60% of that is lottery money, so maybe not quite so bad.

Almost all teams, and I would venture to guess every single team that expects to regularly play in the Champion's League from a major country, will use the amortization method you have outlined.

There are some additional FFP rules around transfer fee net gains/losses when players are sold but this is a really good starting point.  If everyone understands this they will have a better insight into how I expect FSG thinks, too, because in the US there are no significant transfer fees so everything is about annual player expenses.

*In the absence of evidence*, Doping has to pass the same plausibility criteria, again the most important of which being controlling for other factors. In a purely scientific context that would have been extremely difficult (but not impossible) to do if you can only *assume* some people are and are not using performance enhancing drugs. However, in this  case there wasn't much need to be theoretically rigorous because there was ample evidence - anecdotal and documentary - gathered over time to suggest doping was taking place, certainly enough to make *proving* one wasn't gaining an illegal advantage more important than *assuming* that to be the case, hence the introduction of drug-testing regimes.

and then there is this:

&gt; The acceptable deviation is EUR 5 million. However it can exceed this level up to the following amounts only if such excess is entirely covered by contributions from equity participants and/or related parties:
&gt; a) EUR 45 million for the monitoring period assessed in the licence seasons 2013/14 and 2014/15;
&gt; b) EUR 30 million for the monitoring period assessed in the licence seasons 2015/16, 2016/17 and 2017/18;
&gt; c) a lower amount as decided in due course by the UEFA Executive Committee for the monitoring periods assessed in the following years.

So you can run at negative 45M, then negative 30M up until after '17/18.

I don't know what the read is on Article 65, which talks about having to report total cost for each registered player, the amount and date paid, and outstanding debt in the player registration transfer. 

The gold is in Annex VII, section c

&gt; 4. The minimum accounting requirements for licence applicants that capitalise the costs of acquiring a player’s registration are as follows:

&gt; a) In respect of each individual player’s registration, the depreciable amount must be allocated on a systematic basis over its useful life. This is achieved by the systematic allocation of the cost of the asset as an expense over the period of the player’s contract.

It then goes on to say *or* it can be capitalized immediately. It is up to the club. Which means you can front-run your large player purchases into years where there is more flexibility. eg. Chelsea could just load all their purchases this summer into the current financial year and take a large, one-off loss of £100-150M, but then amortize everybody else over the later years when the allowed revenue shortfall is smaller.

**Edit**: thinking about it, I think the section 65 stuff is about preventing clubs from partnering with other lesser clubs to offload player costs. For eg. last year Kevin Prince Boateng transferred to Genoa for 5.5M and then was immediately loaned to AC Milan. I think that entire section is about trying to prevent deals like that and having the 5.5M transfer fee on Milans books",0,1344336438,null,0,false,0,c5pf014,t3_xtd3z,t1_c5pf014,t1_c5pevf0,null,1429573882,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

It'll take you around two and a half hours to go from Manchester to Bridlington. Not much difference between going M62, A614 route or M62, M1, A1, A64, A166. About 5 miles and 5 minutes although going the latter way you can stop get to see some of the fantastic Wolds and also stop at Wetwang fish and chip shop. You'll not miss it because there will be a mass of people parked there as it is extremely popular with tourists and locals. There's a pub next door and a duck pond across the road so it is a nice place to take a break and about a couple of hours into your journey.

On the way to Bridlington stop at [Burton Agnes Hall.](http://www.burtonagnes.com/Home.html) - you'll pass it whatever way you come.

**Bridlington:** South beach - miles and miles and miles of smooth sandy beaches. Go to the harbour and take a boat trip around Bempton Cliffs on the [Yorkshire Belle.](http://www.yorkshire-belle.co.uk/) [Priory Church](http://www.bridlingtonpriory.co.uk/) in Old Town if its your kind of thing. If it is sunny take a walk or go on the [Land Train](http://www.aboutbridlington.co.uk/landtrain.html) along the north cliffs on the town and visit [Sewerby Hall and gardens.](http://www.eastriding.gov.uk/sewerby/index2.html) Visit Flamborough and Bempton. On the way to Flamborough stop and have a walk around [Danes Dyke.](http://www.danesdyke.com/) At Flamborough go visit [the Lighthouse](http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses/lighthouse_list/flamborough.html) which has guided tours and at Bempton go to the world renown [Bempton Cliffs RSPB reserve.](http://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves/guide/b/bemptoncliffs/). You can then go on to Scarborough from there.

[**BRITAIN'S BEST FISH AND CHIP SHOP** is in Bridlington](http://yorkshire.greatbritishlife.co.uk/article/bridlington-chippy-crowned-britains-best-at-at-the-23rd-annual-national-fish-and-chip-awards-32887/) at 

Fish &amp; Chips 149, 149 Marton Road, Bridlington, YO16 7DJ. You'll wonder where your Satnav is taking you as it is about as far from the tourist part of the town as possible.

**Scarborough:** [Peasholm Park is a must](http://www.peasholmpark.com) Time it right and they do a gun battle with remote control ships. Peasholme Park also needs to be visited on a night time as well. You can visit the Lifeboat Station on the south beach. It is also worth taking a drive through [Forge Valley](http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nnr/1006055.aspx) and [Dalby Forest,](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/dalbyforest) stopping off in both and going for a walk. 

As mentioned, definitely worth travelling up the coast road to Whitby. There's the old cathedral that inspired Dracula, an old sailing ship in the harbour complete with cannon and tons of small quirky shops to go see.

Also there is Pickering and take a ride on the [North Yorkshire Moors Railway](http://www.nymr.co.uk) steam trains. You can stop at Goathland Station where Heartbeat was filmed. In fact you can go to Goathland from Whitby and do the NYMR route in reverse, travelling to Pickering by steam train and returning back to Goathland.

**York:** That is a 2 day event in itself. York Minster, National Railway Museum (free), loads of galleries, walk around the medieval walls, Jorvik center, Cliffords Tower, boat trip on the river...

The fact that FFP does not count development expenses against the club is another reason that stadium upgrade/replacement becomes important.  The cost of doing the work does not count against us but the added revenues from the seats do count for us.

On another note...

Quote from your post:
&gt;It then goes on to say or it can be capitalized immediately. It is up to the club. Which means you can front-run your large player purchases into years where there is more flexibility. eg. Chelsea could just load all their purchases this summer into the current financial year and take a large, one-off loss of £100-150M, but then amortize everybody else over the later years when the allowed revenue shortfall is smaller.


From FFP Annex X:
&gt;For the purpose of the break-even calculation:

&gt;iii) For clubs which use the ‘capitalisation and amortisation’ method of
accounting for player registrations in their annual financial statements,
relevant income and relevant expenses must reflect this same accounting
treatment;

&gt;iv) For clubs which use the ‘income and expense’ method of accounting for
player registrations in their annual financial statements, the club can elect
to apply either the ‘income and expense’ or the ‘capitalisation and
amortisation’ method. **The selected treatment must be applied on a
consistent basis from one reporting period to the next.**

So clubs cannot change their method of accounting for transfer fees to do what you outlined with basically scheduling a big loss season.  There may be a method for changing a club's system but I couldn't find one.  At the very least, it shouldn't be easy to do.  I don't particularly like the structure of the regulations but this is one loophole that they did at least think about.",0,1344341328,null,0,false,0,c5pficm,t3_xtd3z,t1_c5pficm,t1_c5pf014,null,1429574136,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Although you are right in that precision motor controls are crucial, I can't agree that its the same as Archery or shooting. Archery takes years to build up the strength in your arms to the degree where you can accurately shoot a bow long distances. Shooting requires a very special combination of strength and relaxation of the body in order to hold the rifle steadily.

I believe a lot of pro SC2 players spend time at the gym in their off-hours, but its fairly telling that physical fitness isnt a core part of their training regime (they mostly work out just to keep the rest of their body healthy). Of course you've got those who have insane click-rates, but I don't know if thats considered essential any more.

I know e-sports have lot of trouble being taken seriously by sports professionals, but you've also got to consider that they are still a relatively young form of competition.

true,henleyregatta,hampshire,Hampshire,"I'm not talking about specific cases, but you're broadly correct in summarising my argument. If there were zero evidence, both ""Doping"" and ""Magic Wheels"" are valid hypotheses. But, so is ""Invisible British Fairies providing assistance"" and ""Foreigner-hating magnets installed under the velodrome floor"". Strictly speaking, under conditions of zero evidence, each of these hypotheses are equally (im)plausible as explanations for exceptional behaviour on the part of a given competitor or team. 

But we're not in a zero-evidence situation. We have specific NEGATIVE evidence for Doping because we're testing for it. Against this negative evidence, in order to continue to use Doping as the explanation for Team GB's results, we have to hypothesise:

1. A new drug has been found that improves an Athlete's performance at cycling without obvious near-term side effects (no pee turning green, bloodshot eyes or violent mood-swings)
1. This new drug evades both the current drug testing regime and expected near-future testing regimes (as samples will be retained for, I think 10 years to re-test as new drugs are found) if we expect to get away with it
1. ONLY Team GB has knowledge of, access to and motivation to use this new Stealth Drug to obtain competitive advantage.

...I hold that believing these are true is more complicated than the ""null hypothesis"" - that Team GB aren't doping - and thus that the doping hypothesis fails Occam's Razor.

A similar argument holds for  ""Magic Wheels""; we've got several pieces of negative evidence which require explaining away in a similar fashion. First start by assuming this hypothesis is real and explain:

1. There exists a new material, manufacturing or maintenance process that delivers wheels with significantly better performance than existing known wheels
1. These Magic Wheels can pass whatever technical scrutineering is in place without comment. They also look, sound and behave the same as ordinary wheels to the untrained eye (all billion or so of them watching these races live and on TV).
1. As with drugs, only Team GB have knowledge of,  access to and motivation for using these Magic Wheels

...And if you weigh this up against the ""null hypothesis"" in this case - that the wheels are just ordinarily expensive and well-maintained and deserving of good treatment - again I assess you're failing Occam's Razor. 

In EITHER case, if you believe any of the hypotheses above is true (especially the one about foreigner-hating magnets), you've got to compare them against the default hypothesis which is that the public explanation (i.e. good training plan etc) isn't sufficient to explain the observed performance. There are good statistical tools that would let you build a mathematical case one way or the other on this but I have neither the time, the ability, nor the data to go through that exercise. 

I've gotten a bit lost in comment here but I want to make a couple of extra points:

First of all, we're in ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" territory here: It's ultimately not our job to explain how there's no Magic Wheels, it's the accuser's job to explain a) how there COULD be Magic Wheels b) How they might affect performance and (crucially) c) how that's not fair given the rules in place AND to provide evidence for their assertions. This is a point that's unrelated to the discussion of what is/is not plausible and likely though.

Secondly, I do want to make clear that my ramblings above about Doping relate to an assessment of the specific situation being discussed and not to this sport or even all sport in general. We KNOW doping has occurred in the past, both in Cycling and in the wider world. We know it's a problem, and we have counter-measures in place to detect this. The bulk of my argument above is based on my own assumption that cyclists have taken the decision that the risk and subsequent consequences of discovery outweighs the potential benefits, and that they're not taking known proscribed substances. I have no evidence for that, but it seems a rational decision to be taken by reasonable people under these circumstances.",0,1344343149,null,0,false,0,c5pfr1p,t3_xtcum,t1_c5pfr1p,t1_c5peyzb,null,1429574256,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

River and Amy are pretty similiar to each other, but that doesn't seem to be an issue. I think the hesitation is more of a resistance, again, to the RTD years, but I think Captain Jack has a chance, considering Moffat created him.

A reminder that maybe she isn't as all knowing as she thinks might be a good way to give her some further characterization beyond ""I love the Doctor, he just doesn't know it yet! Along with a million other things!"". It might be a chance to really bring back that River we saw in the Library, instead of the River that is so mysterious she's hard to relate to.

I don't intend to advocate the practice because I can't agree with it either, but I can see some reasoning behind it. Consider how many applications each store must receive weekly. Every single person who is out of work, seeking part time work, on hard times, needs something to tide them over, just dropped out of school / college / uni etc. will probably pop their CV forward just to get a bit of money in. 

Hundreds if not thousands of people going for the same handful of roles in a store. Superstores are big after all but not THAT big. Not ""employ half the town"" big. 

So how do you sort through all those people? Employ a dedicated team for every single store? Even then I can tell you that speaking to all those people and sorting out who is suitable from who is not would take a hell of a lot of time (if done properly).

Again mainly down to the cheap tenders and the fact that councils don't give a monkeys how they get the job done, so long as it's cheap. 

Now I have nothing against Eastern Europeans and their right to work here at all, but surely these projects should be going to construction gangs from the UK when there are so many who can't find work.

Hell bees kill considerably more people than terrorists do per year and we don't enact laws to monitor everything that's going on to protect us from bees now do we?

It's a greedy corporate world out there these days and you have to be blind and ignorant not to see it. It's not my responsibility or anyone's responsibility other than your own to educate yourself on such matters.

As long as there remains the chance for the select earn money over the expense of the many we're going to see this escalate.

Sources are twisted, facts are blurred, so it's difficult to know who is right but when faced with laws that want to make it OK to read your emails at whim, require access to your personal information whenever, or arrest you for what you post on Facebook I think we're at the point where it's kind of easy to see things are going too far.

Privacy is a human right and the argument of ""The innocent have nothing to hide"" should not even be a factor.

* Day 6: I call them to find out more information. They say they heard back from Head Office on Day 4 that the tablet would be back in stock on Day 6. I point out that it isn't back in stock. They can't help. I point out that they spoiled the birthday surprise. They are sorry. I ask what they will do now. They can't do anything, but if I click a button on the website, it will email me when the tablet is back in stock.

As for Torres, he hasn't proven to be worth 50m yet, but the football Chelsea play is in some ways Hodgson-esque; if the likes of Hazard, Mata and Oscar can gel for Chelsea, they'll have three playmakers feeding Torres - I can't see him having a horror show with suitable quality service like that. He's also been injury-free for a long time by his standards.

You're right on how it happened (although I'm fairly sure they'd already scouted Carroll and when Torres went out, they picked Andy off the shortlist which he was possibly at the top of), but that doesn't justify it as a good decision. Carroll's price should still have mattered for us, because instead of Chelsea paying for one ""promising"" striker, they could have paid for 3-4 new quality signings if we'd waited till summer, or they could have paid for one already established star striker if Dalglish &amp; Comolli had decided to spend 35m on current quality rather than future potential.

I think independent shops have the potential to win a lot of these battles since they can customise their business better to the local area (and style).    

One of brand coffee's big benefits: its consistency, is also one of its biggest drawbacks when you look at how inflexible it makes some of their branches.    

Unfortunately independent stores seem to be run by people with very little business experience in areas like marketing or consumer research. I also feel some of them get a little lazy after being static for, in some cases, twenty or more years.   

In tourist ~~traps~~ areas the shop should focus on whatever it is that brings the tourists to the area; then the shop its self can literally be part of the tourist attraction (instead of a side-show).

true,alex_applause,null,null,"Good question and the honest answer is ""I don't know"". 

I won't make claims that I've designed these tests or have deep insight into the goings on behind them. The only claim that I *would* make is that - for example - today I have reviewed hundreds of CVs for a particular set of roles and of those 95% have been unsuitable because of location issues. 

This is going off at a tangent slightly, but a *lot* of the candidates who have submitted details for the roles I'm speaking about have neglected to put their location on the CVs. I'm told this is to prevent us recruiters for being biased - however I have a set of requirements that I need to work to. 

That means I've spent more time than I'd like calling these people to find out that they don't live in the correct area - something that they could and should have included as realistically they have no more chance by omitting the information than they do by providing it. 

My personal rant aside (and bringing it back to the topic) this can no doubt be carried over to the requirements of ASDA and other major employers as well. I'm not privy to their requirements but I imagine they have various roles and have various standards in place with regards to who can fit those roles. For instance - say they need a shelf stacker - they're not going to want to take on another 65 year old lady who is looking to bring a few more pounds in whilst sitting behind a till. You could say that's ageist... but personally I can see some very real safety reasons for it as well! 

Another thought I had behind this... you're right in that anyone with some sense can work out how to answer these tests. You don't want to say ""I react to all disagreements by shouting at people"" - would you? Not for a customer facing role? But perhaps there's an element of psychology there as well... they're looking for someone who *can* lie and put on a straight face and smile - because that's exactly what they need the employees to do when they have to deal with troublesome customers. You want people who can either be nice enough to deal with anything, or sneaky enough to deal with it and hide what they're really thinking. 

Perhaps there is a method to the madness. Though please don't quote me on it! ",0,1344352506,null,0,false,0,c5phjgt,t3_xtfhh,t1_c5phjgt,t1_c5pheho,null,1429575078,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I previously applied for a chef position at a new Harvester pub opening. Not something I would usually try and apply for because of no experience etc, but the advert specifically stated that full training or an apprenticeship were an option and no experience was necessary. I went through all the online bullshit to submit my application, and amazingly I got an interview.

Fastforward to said interview, the first question asked was 'so what previous chef experience do you have?' to which I pointed out what was in the advert and my CV/application, they just apologised and told me they wanted people with experience, and I only got given the interview because I must have gotten over a certain percentage of the bullshit questions correct. If they had even bothered to read it beforehand they could see I had no experience.

Another time, in-store in Morrisons there was an advert for a bakery apprenticeship, I asked about it at customer services and they said to hand in an application form which I did a few days later.

About 6 weeks later I got a letter in the post with a generic copy paste response ""we have no positions available in store currently"" which leads me to believe they hadn't even read it, as it was for a specific job/apprenticeship.

&gt; Abort67 is a group which **advocates the tactics** of anti-abortion campaigners in the United States, who regularly picket abortion clinics and **have murdered doctors and medical staff** who work there.

He's claiming they advocate tactics that include murder. But he doesn't provide evidence of this. When this is picked on in the comments he says:

&gt; I didn't say that Abort67 supports (or openly supports) the murder of doctors and nurses, but it comes from the same poisoned well as those who do.

Which seems like an odd argument. He claims that he's an anti-zionist. So are Hamas, does that mean he can be associated with them the same way?

He condemns them for comparing abortion to the holocaust (fair enough) but then compares them to the german christians that supported Hitler.

&gt; The purpose of German Christians was to breed for race and nation and Abort67 would have been most welcome in German Christian circles and in the Reich Church headed by Bishop Muller.

So now they're racists. Again, no supporting evidence is provided.

There seems to be very little about Abort67 themselves or or their tactics (other than picketting Wiston’s Clinic). He briefly mentions the support they receive from Worthing Jubilee Church though gives no details about them. He spends most of the article talking about evangelical Christians in the USA. Basically a load more guilt by association. If this is what they do is the USA then it must be what they do here too!!

Yeah, hindsight does make this more painful.

Don't understand why you're saying ""Look to America"", they still have their 1c and 2c coins.

Anyway, you are wrong. Using Australia as an example, they got rid of their 1c and 2c coins, yet they still advertise items/fuel for sale with the odd cents (not ending in a 0 or 5). If something was advertised as $*.99/98/etc, you would pay that if you pay by card, otherwise it will be rounded up/down to the nearest 5c if you pay by cash. 

$1.99/98 would therefore be rounded up to $2, $1.97/96 rounded down to $1.95, etc.

Two stories:  

1. We (me+partner) were shown around a property listed at £625/pm. Once we said we wanted it, the agent told us the real price was £725/pm. We had no realistic alternatives, and needed a place to live because our *previous* landlord had decided they wanted our other place back after 6 months for family use (mysteriously back on the market almost instantly after we left).  

2. In a different city, we agreed a let of £1350 for a house-share and, once we had all gone on holiday together, agents called back and said the new price was £1500 inc council tax (of ~£100/pm).

Something about her (Rose), how she grows to be like him and him her. Their budding friendship in the beginning and longing and care for one another as the show went on, the connection of the FA Doctor with a stranger, then friend that becomes a lover as they become alike. Martha was a ok companion for a short bit and Donna was good in her ways but neither had that spark of connection. Pond fits the new Doctor but only as the ""tin dog"" type of companion whereas Tennant's version with Rose had the make love not war type of passion and the adventures was just them popping out for a date. River song...the River Song character I don't understand. She did well with Tennant in Silence in the Library but in this show...it's to forced, seems to early for that story arc as this Doctor strikes me as the asexual gonna throw a rock at a vagina and run the other way type of Doctor.

To which I would say, I think its better top think of these rules and definitions in gradient instead of binary terms.  The writers certainly do, to give themselves leeway.  So the difference between the Time Lock and other fixed points is a difference of degree, not kind. Or to say it another way, some points are more fixed than others. The Doctor was able to finesse the situation on Mars and beat the odds.  But the Time War can be thought of as the biggest, most-fixed point in the universes history, with no wiggle room. 

You're right that the Time Lords can't travel out of the War, but thats just because their presence there is part of whats fixed.

Admittedly from a technical aspect it must have been difficult to continue a romantic arc with two different actors with two different sets of characteristics and personalities.

Choking on the words, despite her previous acting, was refreshing. 

As for the Doctors, Nine and Rose's relationship was very blurred between infatuation and paternal love, in my opinion. Obvious daddy issues given her situation, and I think she played it off rather well. When it came to Ten, though, he was young and good looking compared to Nine so there was more of a sexual/romantic angle that this scene wrapped up in the best way it could have, I think.

true,FlamingBearAttack,null,null,"Yeah, I agree that if people are just peacefully exercising their right to protest then there is nothing wrong with it. I certainly wouldn't go 'fuck with them' just because I disagree with their opinion. 

What I dislike about these protesters is that some of the tactics they use seem a bit much or cruel. Some of them [protest at clinics as women go in to have an abortion, and stand prominently with placards and may even call out to patients](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/13/anti-abortion-activism-clinic-vigil). That just strikes me as a very insensitive and cruel, almost bullying way to behave. No-one takes abortion lightly, so it is very uncaring to politicise and foist your opinion upon someone going through the most difficult time of their life and make it even harder for them.

Apparently the [police have charged some protesters over the content of some of their banners](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9400183/Christian-protesters-charged-by-police-over-displaying-graphic-anti-abortion-banner.html), so perhaps they aren't protesting entirely legally. In that article it explains that the protesters were charged with causing “harassment, alarm or distress” under the Public Order Act 1986. It seems to me that a protest outside a clinic providing abortions, aimed at women about to have an abortion, would cause a considerable amount of distress or alarm.

Clearly you have no idea what ""Logic"" actually is, or means. But do go on.

&gt; Firstly, it's not a child, it's a parasite at best until it can survive on its own.

Please direct me to a 2 year old that can survive on it's own.

Also, newborn children can survive from just 20 weeks of pregnancy nowadays, but if they are born they are human all of a sudden? Can you please show me how their DNA suddenly transforms?

Parasites are by definition external in origin. Also, the word ""Parasite"" is extremely derogatory and denotes something that has an utterly negative influence, and is of no worth.

&gt;respond to stimuli

I assume you're aware that unborn children respond well to sound and touch? no? Oh well now you are.

&gt;Second... What of women who are raped, whom the pregnancy will kill

The majority of Pro-lifers agree that abortion in this case should be at the discretion of the mother. Not all though.

&gt;who do not make enough money to give the child a decent life?

For example, I remember a post over there that was just 'I hate Amy Pond, she's stupid.' While this could very well be how the person feels, I feel it's understandable where the down votes come from. It is not a statement that lends itself to discussion, nor is the person justifying their opinion with any sensibility. 

Personally, I rarely down vote ever, and that goes double for here and Gallifrey. However, I think it is still important to see why certain posts get down votes, and it's not simply disagreeing, but the manner in which someone states their opinion.

true,Swooshington,1953,,"Truth be told, it depends on City and Untied. If City come out like they finished last season it would be no real shame or embarrassment finishing below them, and the reality is United will always drag something out. I think we will find out stride, but I worry about how long it might take us. Even Arsenal and Spurs look capable of flying out of the traps this year. I think a top 4 finish is the imperative aim for the season. We need the financial benefit of CL football for FFP, and leaving it like we did this past year is not something we can risk again. 

The FA Cup and Carling Cups are always nice additions, so a decent cup run in either would be a nice addition for the season. What's more, it would be great to start the season with a win in the Shield, but its not really something I care too much about. A decent performance and signs of cohesion between the new guys is a bigger victory in my mind.

The CWC and Supercups would also be phenomanal achievements, and depending on the depth of the squad and the form, depends on my desire. Truth is, I'd love a strong show in the CWC as an international display of our talent, to win some international fans, especially after losing over in the States. However, between performing well in the league, or winning those, I would pick the league. If we have good depth, and everyone is performing reasonably, I'd love to see us rotate a bit. I'd love to see Piazon, Feruz, Chalobah, Kane and Blackman given starts and minutes, and I think these competitions can see that a reality, whether it be league rotation or sub appearances.

And finally, our Champions League. There's no shame in not retaining it. Very few clubs do. In fact, I think the last club to do it was AC Milan decades ago, and before that the all conquering Liverpool and Ajax sides of the 80s. Would I love us to? Yes, if only to shut the Scousers up. But I think we need to accept and admit how lucky we were to win it. We deserved the luck *coughoverbocough*, but it was still there. Through the group stage, and if we are to go out, let it be to a top side.

Ultimately, I'd like to see is take strides towards the football we should be playing. We have all the talent, and all the right players for attacking football. We also have some top youth, so I'd like to see them brought through slowly. Do I think Di Matteo is the man? I'm not sure. I'd love him to come good, and will back him all the way. But I have a suspicion that he will need to step up if he is to stay in the job. I'd also like to see a lot more of the Torres/Mata bromance...preferably with the patented Torres slide celebration that I'm sure Usain Bolt has stolen.

The rest of S6 is the younger doctor, and the mystery of how he can get around being shot. It's set up that his getting shot is a ""fixed point in time"" that cannot get changed.

The season finale has River refuse to shoot him, and time unravels as the fixed point is no longer fixed. At the end of the episode, in the warped time of that episode, the Doctor reveals to River that he had his own plan in place to survive. ""The Doctor in a Doctor Suit"". He had borrowed the Tesselecta, a person-sized, time traveling spaceship that could also morph it's exterior appearance. Oh, and the Tesselecta's pilots are miniturized inside it. He then piloted/drove the Tesselecta to the meeting where he would get shot. He was there, The Doctor got shot. Except it was actually the Tesselecta, with the Doctor inside, that got shot. He shut down the Tesselecta to mimic death, and it was the Tesselecta that was burned, while the Doctor was safe inside.

When River sees this, she realizes that the Doctor is actually safe, and allows time to be repaired.

true,Raffles_Dad,null,null,"I am now going off to University (as a very mature student) but have worked in a number of different areas including care. In care work you have the CRB scam, an agency will advertise well paid care jobs but require you to cover the cost of the CRB (An enhanced CRB check  now costs £44.00), so you enquire and they ask for a CRB. Even if you have a recent CRB they will say it is not the right one/not recent and get you to pay for them to do a CRB. As an individual you cannot get a CRB only an organisation can so people pay up the fee (plus £2+ processing charge) for a enhanced CRB check. You will be sent a copy of your CRB but you will be told that you are on a waiting list/no jobs in your area right now.  If you have never seen a CRB form or check with the Criminal Records Bureau (who are okay if you pay hardball with them) then you will never know you have just been scammed, there is no job and they have just taken your £50. 

I see this in the jobcentre plus website every day in the UK and have reported it but nothing is done, I would love to know how many unemployed people fall for this in the UK as I guess this is a multimillion pound a year industry. 

Even if you point this out to the job centre they will still get away with it as they just ban the IP address, if you get the jobcentre to do anything. 

So that is one example of how scamming an applicant works, but asda is a walmart company. A company that did give it employees advice on how to get  benefits until it was found out, it did not pay people more just stopped the classes. I worked for ASDA when I was in school 20 years ago and back then I got paid more (checkouts) than people do now, how the hell do you get paid less 20 years later? My job was before minimum wage but have checked the adverts at my local asda and asked the person working the till today and they are paid less than I was 20 years ago. Okay it is only 48p an hour less but I know I pay more for everything now than I did 20 years ago. 

Okay this is rough maths from this point, but better than you will see in most newspapers in the world but I am going on quick googled figures and thus may be inaccurate  (but they are better figures than you see day to day but I’m just more honest). So if the Walton family (no not that one) can screw you out of 5-10p for a phone call they will do as that is how they work, getting 5-10p is nothing until you think worldwide. 

So if they get 1500 people a day in the UK that is 9% of the world population. Worldwide that would be at least 15 000 people at 5p a minute, assuming 5 minutes that would be £3750 a day, every day for doing nothing. 

Unlike walmart I’m working on the lowest estimate but if you consider 10p a minute for a 10 minute call for 25 000 people in the UK then worldwide this is ¼ a million pounds a day, or just sort of £100 million a year.

And that is before you consider tax breaks for trying to find work for people. 

Does it make sense now?

true,QDean,eng-dorset,Dorset,"Nowadays, it's no longer the tenants responsibility to prove their innocence. 

In England and Wales (and very recently, Scotland), the deposit is presumed to belong to the Tenant. The deposit is the Tenants money. The landlord or agent has to prove damage beyond fair wear-and-tear.

There are various rules now, for deposits. If a LL/Agent takes a deposit from a Tenant, it has to be lodged with an approved deposit scheme. If an Inventory or any evidence is to be used the Tenant has to have had the opportunity to review that evidence. If it any point the LL/Agent cannot prove the Tenant has agreed, explicitly or implicitly, to the evidence, then the entire deposit is returned to the Tenant.

As a disclaimer, I work for Inventoryclerk.com , so I am hardly a disinterested party. However, I will say that Tenants have rights and recourse these days, but the biggest problem is that the Tenants do not know this.

I would advise any tenant to read:

If we can close on even 3 of these, we'll be in a good position to compete for fourth. I don't think Podolski and Giroud will have amazing seasons for Arsenal. Their season will hinge on the transfer of RvP and his form throughout the season. The only reason they did so well last year is because he had a miraculous season which he is doubtful to ever replicate.

Chelsea is hard to gauge. Sure, they added tons of talent but they aren't really a Premier League team. I feel like RDM will have way too many egos in the locker room to play the team that he wants.

I hope other cycling fans got as big a laugh out of that one as I did!

I don't really think she did too much wrong here, though. She was leaning in to Pendleton (but holding her line), Pendleton leant back as a natural response (but lost her line as her wheels slipped up the banking) and that caused the real contact. You could get penalised for leaning in if the commissaires really felt it was endangering the other rider, but the easier and more obvious call is just to pin it on Pendleton for leaving her line. I'd have said that Meares' was sticking her elbows in but without really endangering Pendleton, and Pendleton could be forgiven for marginally leaving her line accidentally in pushing back because that's just racing, but the UCI have openly stated their intent to be more strict about these things, so it's an understandable decision.

There is now a generation of property owners and a generation of renters - it's the wealthier amongst the property-owning generation who hold second properties as an investment, thus denying ownership to the younger generation.

It would be pretty easy to make rental property less attractive as an investment, which would act to lower prices and put more into occupier ownership. It would be easy to increase rights for tenants, make it harder to kick them out and give them more protection in their homes. It would be easy to raise taxes on investment properties.

I actually have a bit of faith in my MP, despite him being a conservative he's defied the party whip on occasions and seems to be part of the civil liberties wing of the party.

I'd seriously recommend writing a letter to your MP, they are there to represent all of their constituents, not just the ones that voted for them.

My letter read as follows (and the analogies are probably wrong, but)...

&gt;Dear Sir,

&gt;I notice, with some concern I might add, the planned legislation requiring ISPs to keep details of visited websites, voip calls and online gaming.

&gt;I believe that the proposed legislation is not only unworkable, but also ineffective. This, combined with the fact that it is in addition to previous legislation suggests that further bills will be presented when this one is found to be insufficient for the intended outcomes.

&gt;The legislation will require huge amounts of new infrastructure for ISPs, requiring data centres for the reams of browsing logs, not to mention the fact that backups will be required, all kept with Data Protection Act in mind. Who will meet the costs of this new requirement, is this something that will be put in at the taxpayer's expense or will it instead be placed on top of broadband connection costs.

&gt;As to the ineffectiveness, with the ease of access to VPNs, Proxy Servers and the relatively new TOR network, the ability to disguise one's browsing habits, downloads and other nefarious activities has already surpassed the planned legislation. For want of an analogy it is as if all car journeys are to be tracked by satelite, but there is a network of underground tunnels that allow access to every possible location in the world; all the satellites would be able to see is you entering the tunnel.

&gt;So you might think, lets ban the use of these networks and only allow Http (websites) and smtp (e-mail) traffic, which is fine, except that unless you monitor every single packet of data anyone in the country it will be impossible to actually identify the people using them, as it is relatively simple to mimic these traffic types.

&gt;The crucial difference between the analogy mentioned above (cars and roads) is that car journeys happen in a public space, where is there no expectation of privacy, or at least no legal right to one, whereas, on the whole, internet access is an act done from a private space, where I believe there is a reasonable right to private life, I would believe that this would be challenged in the European Court of Human Rights which would mean expensive legal costs on top of the costs mentioned above.

&gt;I understand that there is a need to protect the nation against terrorism, and children from abuse, perhaps this could be achieved by targeting these specific threats with warrants, rather than a blanket measure of holding everybody's data.

&gt;I urge you to consider voting against this awful piece of legislation ",0,1344383221,null,0,false,0,c5ppyf5,t3_xully,t1_c5ppyf5,t1_c5ppnvz,null,1429579228,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You can, in theory, buy a Team GB road bike (or a Wiggo special identical to the Tour de France winner) from the manufacturers, whose name I cannot remember because it is 1am, but who are listed as part of the competition information for the Olympics and Tour de France respectively. They're price-on-request and widely thought to be about £20-30k all told, but they are theoretically available to other teams and the general public. That said, when it's a millimetre-perfect custom fitted frame and things, being able to buy an exact copy is almost certainly a total waste (unless you are Wiggins' or Pendleton's evil twin), and I have no idea if you're required to be able to buy a correctly fitted version of the same bike. 

Give it 5-10 years and I expect we'll see F1-style construction rules and the like, which will be a shame but perhaps fairer. Then again, the argument can be made that all that's really going on is the ever-better matching of bike to rider, and to prohibit/approve certain technologies will unfairly penalise some riders, so it could go either way. I mean, you'll never stop the well-funded teams from getting in the wind tunnel and optimising that, and aerodynamic gains are definitely the big ones. I have no idea at the marginal first/second/third end, but further down the field, if everyone had had their aerodynamics analysed and refined as much as the UK cyclists have, things would look a lot more bunched up.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"I still think this guy could be a pretty big flop in England, personally. I mean he's obviously a great prospect but for someone who adds basically nothing to build up play he's not the most clinical goalscorer. 

He's like a more skillful Mario Gomez who doesn't finish as well. Often in the right place at the right time, but if he's not scoring he's not helping the team at all. 

Physically he's a beast which bodes well for the Premiership, but he also relies on that strength fairly often in Brazil and he won't be able to do that here to the same degree. He's not gonna be manhandling Vidic or Kompany or some shit. 

Furthermore in spite of his strength he has a lot to improve on in his play with back to goal. He is not a hold-up striker like Adebayor. He's less agile with worse touch and slower.

If we can get Ade in relatively cheaply and then add Leandro on top of that, I'd be very excited. But I really don't want to see us splashing our record transfer fee on a Brazilian prospect and immediately putting pressure on him. He's insanely gifted and has world class potential, but at the moment he has a lot of big flaws in his game which kind of turn me off from dropping 25m or something on him.

I wouldn't complain if we got him for a reasonable price of course. This is the type of player we really do have to sort of take a chance on. 

I could easily see Chelsea stepping in again, though Jjetset seems very confident we'll be getting him. I just don't see it personally, unless we're really going to splash some cash.
