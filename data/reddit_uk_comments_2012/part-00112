For some reason they only started the process when I moved in, so it took 4 weeks on the old provider before I was moved to Spark.  I immediately requested to go back to BG and had to wait another 4 weeks for that to happen.  Spark and BG then spent 12 months deciding what my final meter reading was (despite me having told them both and I'm pretty sure BG actually taking it in person). It was an utter farce that resulted in me getting a final bill 12 months later for £150 for 4 weeks worth of electricity from Spark. I paid it because the cost of electricity had gone up significantly in the 12 months so I was effectively block buying it for a lower price, BG then charged me a nominal £5 a month for the next 12 months and still gave me money back at the end of it (£120 or something).

I personally think Hulk would be the most important acquisition we could make but i don't see it as realistic. With Hulk we'd have the best offense in the EPL, I think. We could then get away with a Sandro/M'Vila midfield in a 4-2-3-1, which would shut down players like Hazard/Cazorla.

&gt;20p in every £1 goes to support local health related good causes.

So where does the other 80% go?

National Lottery meanwhile

&gt;In the period up to March 2013, around 28% of total National Lottery revenue is expected to go to the Good Causes.

&gt;Over the course of the third licence, over 50% of total National Lottery revenue is expected to be paid to winners in prizes, while 12% of total revenue is expected to be paid to the Government in Lottery Duty. National Lottery retailers will earn 5% in sales commission for each Draw-Based Game – and 6% commission on each Scratchcard (Camelot's retailers earn, on average, £7,800 per annum in lottery commission). Operating costs will be around 4% of total revenue.

&gt;In line with the incentivised model introduced by the NLC for the third licence period, the percentage of profit will be determined by how much the operator raises for National Lottery Good Causes.

Well not in the Scottish system at least.

Looking at our net transfers, we've only spent 2 million pounds. If the 70 million transfer check Levy revealed at the start of the window is true, then with that money + the Modric money (some people assume this was part of the 70 but I've seen no evidence to suggest that is the case) surely we could splurge a bit now?? It's realistically our last chance to splurge - we should grab a few young-ish stars. 

Could you imagine Spurs with Moutinho, Damiao, and Hulk in the starting rotation? I say Damiao because he's still young and has shown that he has good skills. He's much like Ade, with better footwork and more clinical finishing but not as good at bringing teammates into the game and assisting. I think Damiao could blossom into a better player than Ade and I think, even if we don't *need* another striker, we should get our hands on him before someone else does.

As busstopboxer said, Jol plays him deep. Previously alongside Murphy but now next to Diarra. It's a very formidable duo, too. 

If you look at his attributes, they are not even very well-suited for a more forward position and Dembele himself has said he prefers a central midfield role.

He's strong on the ball, an impeccable dribbler, excellent defensively, a hard-worker, and he plays a simple and tidy passing game. He is pretty toilet in front of goal, so it made sense to drop him deeper.

I think he's exactly what we need because of his dribbling and ball-retention. He can surge forward like Luka, linking midfield and attack. He also creates a lot of space for others by sucking opponents in and wriggling away. 

The player was absolutely brilliant with Diarra last weekend in the 5-0 game. He's top quality and affordable.

From the first time we meet Rory he is treated as a nuisance despite his devout loyalty to Amy. Rory's relationship with Amy began as an unhealthy and unrequited crush (she actually assumed he was *gay*) and continued into this one-sided codependent relationship.

Amy has consistently made childish and reckless decisions without regard to how this would affect Rory. Despite knowing that the TARDIS has *always* been shit at getting you back on time (she knows this from therapy-inducing experience), she ""ran away with another man on her wedding night"" (her words), leaving her wedding ring intentionally behind to escape her wedding.

She drags Rory into danger despite his pleas and constantly treats him as a ""tagalong"" and not as her fiancee, making remarks like how she'd like the Doctor to pretend to be her husband, but would rather Rory be her brother.

She doesn't inform him about a pregnancy (which she instead tells the Doctor about) and hold resentment against him after he was unwillingly hypnotized by a siren.

Rory has dedicated thousands of years of his life to protecting and caring for Amy, but Amy has shown very little return for this intense loyalty.

This is a *very* broken relationship that simply cannot run on ""ONE TRU LUV"" forever. These issues need to be addressed and resolved.

The Ukrainian league is not the same level as the Portuguese league and the fact that Hulk has scored so many more goals in less matches than Willian while playing most of the time in the same position shows, to me at least, that he's definitely worth the increased cost over Willian. 

Willian seems like the better investment, though, so that also makes him a more realistic prospect.

Ahem. It wasn't quite 35 million *dollars* ... :)

I don't mind Andy Carroll at all. He is saddled with the pressure of a huge price tag (not his fault), a reputation that is immobile and unable to adjust to our new style of play (a bit his fault but also a lack of opportunity to prove himself).

Stewart Downing? I've grown to dislike him. I don't think his technique and skill has suddenly left him (after all, this *should* be the prime years of his career), so I have to assume that it's a psychological issue. Perhaps he lacks the confidence to be at a big club with big expectations.

I want reiterate what /u/DoktorStrangelove stated earlier:

&gt;Downing out (like you said), Suarez to the right wing (like you said), Carroll in the middle, and Borini on the left. Sterling and Assaidi are your two wing subs, for now.

We can all acknowledge that this isn't a new idea but it's an idea that I keep coming back to as well.

I've been a member of this community since way back when it had fewer than 1,000 subscribers. While I must admit that the quality in the posts has gone down since then, with much more meme/silly content, I feel that your new rules are bad for two reasons:

1. You're banning practically everything. It would be easier to just list what is allowed here or prohibit links altogether than to create such a complicated list of what sort of content is disallowed.

2. You have given yourself and your fellow mods a huge job that is going to make your lives miserable.

I applaud your efforts, of course, as this remains one of my favorite subreddits and I'm curious to see how all this pans out. One suggestion, though? I mod over at /r/asoiaf and we implemented a no meme/silly content policy a few months ago. Our solution was to create another subreddit, /r/asongofmemesandrage, for people to post such content to. It has been largely successful in that people don't get angry when we remove their posts anymore. We just tell them, ""that belongs at /r/asomar"" and they usually post there, collect their precious karma, and everyone is happy.

true,canard_glasgow,null,null,"&gt;It is an exam in english and that includes spelling and grammar.

Yes, (English is a proper noun btw and is :. spelt with a capital letter) but it is not an exam **on** spelling and grammar. A paper with 100% perfect spelling and grammar could still be utter nonsense, it is the students understanding of the subject that is being tested. You need to accept that these exams are taken without the assistance of a computer and it is the first stressful situation that many young people have been placed in. Mistakes happen. If you take a heavy handed approach you will reward those with better spelling and grammar over those that actually understand the subject. That is not the desired outcome of the exam.  

&gt; Is that how dumbed down they've become where an incorrect answer still gets the same mark as a correct one?

true,OriginalEnough,eng-norfolk,Norfolk,"It tells you that you are at least up to the standard of the exam, which would be enough for most vocations. Imagine if the driving test required you to change the engine of your car yourself before letting you on the road. If you're planning to take any higher position, then you need further exams to show that you are up to their standards. Examination isn't supposed to be a sadistic ritual of making children suffer, as Mr Gove seems to see it; it's meant to allow someone to gauge, from abysmal to poor to capable to excellent, how capable you are at the subject.

Thus, there should be easy questions to test basic candidates, medium questions to test above average candidates and tougher, but not sadistic or unpleasant, questions for the advanced candidates. Then, everyone receives a grade that is to serve as a guide to their ability in that subject in the immediate future. There's no point failing someone completely if they can do basic arithmetic, geometry, algebra, etc., but struggle with differentiation, Standard Deviation and advanced polynomials.

I was two marks away from perfect scores on my Maths GCSE papers and I did the whole thing in a year. But then, I was interested in and bloody brilliant at Maths.

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"Alright, there's several problems with this, let's go:

1. Downing &amp; Enrique got in each other's way all the time last season - they both make the same runs and look to attack the same space. If I recall correctly, at Newcastle Enrique had Gutierrez in front of him, a more grafting wide midfielder rather than a winger, so it worked well because Gutierrez could cover while Enrique bombed forward. Also, Downing's best seasons at Villa came from playing on the right, where he'll provide more goals and also a good amount of chances (he's probably one of the best in the league when it comes to crossing with his weaker foot); also, it makes him more unpredictable, because he can come inside and across his fullback to shoot, or go down the line and cross, whereas on the left he rarely ever cut inside to shoot.

2. A two-man central midfield won't work when one of those two midfielders is Gerrard. Gerrard showed exceptional positional discipline at the Euros, but I honestly think that was because Roy sold it to him and the players that, given how little time he'd been afforded since coming in, their best chance of succcess was ""two banks of four"". Gerrard can hold his position, but when the game starts to go against Liverpool he switches to Roy of the Rovers and does his own thing - we saw this against West Brom, where after we went a goal down he started trying passes that were too ambitious, eventually giving away possession that led to Agger's red card. Also, this formation asks Gerrard to do too much defensive work, which limits the amount of creativity he can provide, and is also not a good idea in general with his age and injury record. Gerrard's best position is undoubtedly just behind the striker where he can provide excellent creativity, a goal threat, and also excellent defensive output.

3. Sahin is **not** a defensive midfielder. He's more like Michael Carrick or Mikel Arteta - a passer who can do some defensive work. But in this formation, especially where the other central midfielder is Gerrard (see above). Lucas needs to start, but then we're in the same situation as last season where the entire midfield collapses without Lucas because he's the only one there to defend.

So, fix us from getting overrun in midfield *every week* and the mess on the left flank, and ignore the fact that Rodgers won't abandon his 4-2-3-1 pressing-passing system anytime soon, and then we'll see. :P",0,1345740184,null,0,false,0,c5xm391,t3_yp925,t1_c5xm391,t3_yp925,null,1429715969,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

This is the part that got us in trouble, because we were talking or influencing the player directly or indirectly without going through the club.

First the NESV website sham, which was just stupid, and then Rodgers' comments that we were interested in him. We said and did all these things without following up with a formal bid, and Dempsey has since gone on strike, which gives the appearance that we are influencing him (we have) - which is illegal.  It was very weird to have a player on strike who hadn't had a formal transfer bid made for him. 

I was never comfortable with the Dempsey situation, either put in a bid or move along. I *hate* that we are now the club that [does this](http://tweetmeme.com/story/3881251972/liverpool-to-report-chelsea-for-tapping-up-fernando-torres-the-sun-sport-football) to other players.

**Edit:** and to add, [I pointed out at the time](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/wru56/rodgers_reveals_dempsey_enquiry/c5fyopg?context=3) of the Rodgers press conference that talking about Dempsey was a mistake.

Swansea had two fairly distinct shapes with and without the ball in the second half of the season. 

At any rate, deep midfield is not a position I want to see him in with the ball. I'm glad he has the discipline to drop back and defend but he really doesn't have the agility IMO. I suppose he could play the role a bit like Frank Lampard does but I just don't think he was purchased to play in a 4-3-3.

which is why this came up, all talk and no enquiry = tapping up

except BR said we were interested in signing him, although he said 'but we don't talk about players from other clubs', which makes it ok /s

&gt; very word Rodger said to the media about Carroll was evidence of him trying to offload Carroll.

we accepted a bid from West Ham from him, the fact that he keeps coming up suggests that we are still trying to sell him. This is also completely unrelated to the Fulham TappingUp Saga, please discuss this case on its merits.

&gt; And frankly, I don't care what managers talk about other players if all they are saying

But that is different to another manager saying ""We are interested in signing Suarez""

Everybody needs to know what tapping up is. When BR made those original comments I was the only Liverpool fan that seemed to notice that what he said wasn't right, while a whole bunch of other people saw it for what it was. 

The whole point of the tapping up rules is to protect player investments, so you don't end up in exactly the situation that Fulham are in right now - a player who wants to leave because he knows another club is interested in him and he is refusing to play. It is different when a club turns down a bid and then that happens, that is why this is all written into the rules.

LFC fans went nuts when Mascherano didn't show up to training, even though Barca made a bid, went nuts again when Torres handed in the transfer request, even though Chelsea had put in a transfer bid first (and I am not talking about 'going nuts' over losing the players, but going nuts because they had both obviously been tapped up). we don't do this to other clubs, end of story.",0,1345745715,null,0,1345746287,0,c5xnnxs,t3_yp58c,t1_c5xnnxs,t1_c5xnhgx,null,1429716710,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

As for what I think people need to know, I guess it depends on where the person in question is from. In NorthAm, our public education with respect to that period of time is woefully lacking for the following reasons:

a) Canada isn't a country yet, and this was a very formative period for us, so there's a lot of our own history to absorb

b) we had our own war going on over here

c) the US's Independence War and and Civil War sandwich it chronologically and seem to supersede it in in terms of cultural awareness.

Because of all that, I think almost *any* information imparted to someone living here would likely be new, though most of them wouldn't find it interesting. To wit, the main street in our capital city is called Wellington, and there's a huge push to rename it because tragically, most people over here don't know who he is or just don't care.

On the other hand, Britain takes a great deal of pride in their participation in the Napoleonic era(from what I understand), and in Wellington and Nelson specifically. Because of that, it seems like it would be difficult to try to tell you something you don't already know, and to be totally honest, I've always been a little intimidated speaking to Brits about it as a result of that.

true,APeacefulWarrior,null,null,"Here's the basic problem with the Daleks, as I see it:  They're brilliant when written well, and awful when written badly.  There's no such thing as a mediocre Dalek episode.  They're either terrifying or utterly laughable.

Good Dalek episodes are ones where they're brutal bastards who kill anything that stands in their way, cannot be reasoned with (and will usually shoot you for even trying), and the Doctor only barely escapes by the skin of his teeth.  The bad ones involve the Daleks sitting around and talking, capturing the Doctor without exterminating him, and tying him and his Companion to unexplained human-sized chairs.  (But he'll tell us why later.)

And see, here's the thing that automatically makes me worry about *Asylum*.  We see shots of the Doctor walking around surrounded by Daleks, but they're not shooting him.  Virtually **any** explanation for this is likely going to further strain the credibility of the Daleks because, pretty much fundamentally, they are only scary when they're psychotic.

I don't understand why the writers don't seem to get this.  No, Asylum hasn't aired and I *could* be totally wrong and they actually have some believable reason that the Daleks aren't off raping the known universe and are happily letting the Doctor walk around free...  but I just don't see it as very likely.

And seeing as it was Moffat who signed off on Victory of the Daleks and its iDalek designs, I can't say I've got my hopes up very far.  ",0,1345748818,null,0,false,0,c5xokrj,t3_yoonz,t1_c5xokrj,t3_yoonz,null,1429717145,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,stop___grammar_time,tardis,TARDIS,"I've watched it. I can't tell you if *you'll* enjoy it, but I can give you my impressions at  least, and I'll try to spoil as little as possible.

It's not like Doctor Who. It's targeted at an older audience, so there's a lot of sex and violence and swearing.  In my opinion, sometimes it feels over the top, especially with the swearing - a lot of times (to me) in season one, the swearing feels really artificial, like they just peppered in swear words to emphasize that it's catering to an adult audience. I've heard from other people that they thought the sex and violence was over the top too, but I didn't think it was particularly bad compared to other shows I've watched (American).  

Bear in mind that each season is pretty different from the rest. Season 1 and 2 are episodic like Doctor Who - for the most part, each episode is a separate adventure. Season 1 to me felt a little clunky at times, but most new series are like that as they find their footing. I think it starts to hit a stride in season 2 - stories feel more organized, the dialogue feels more natural. In both seasons certain story elements felt way too over the top at times for the world they had set up for it, but I also felt that those were a nod to its parent show Doctor Who. Overall the first two seasons are a pretty fun ride, with kind of a British ""X-Files Light""/""Buffy"" vibe.

Also, the end of Season 1 ties in with Doctor Who. The last episode of season 1 leads directly into Doctor Who, Series 3, episode 11, ""Utopia"".

In Season 3 Torchwood changes radically. Season 3 was a mini-series, one story stretched over 5 episodes. It changes drastically in tone into more of a serious action/drama/suspense. It's got a sort of ""24"" vibe to it.

Season 4 was a collaboration between the BBC and Starz. Targeted to a US audience I think it tried to recapture the feel of Season 3, but didn't, and it received mixed reviews from the fans.

true,Jaguarkmd,lfc68,,"Everybody seems to be panicking 20 minutes into our fourth game (three of them Europa League) of the season. I think everybody would be a lot calmer if they remembered three things:

1. While every team goes through offseason change, with new signings etc., few teams attempt to radically reinvent their playing style. Even against lesser opponents (such as Hearts), if they're playing the same system as they did a year before (and I have no clue if they are or not) they will be more comfortable in it than we are in ours, at least at the beginning.

2. Part of the point of the passing is to probe for good openings. If one isn't there, we pass back and forth, and backwards to Reina, and then try again to probe for new openings. They're all worthwhile passes, and much better than hoofing it or trying a ball with a 1% chance of going through.

3. The other point of passing is to make the ball do much of the work. Do you see how much Hearts players are pressing in an attempt to win it back as we go Shelvey-Agger-Reina-Agger-Carra-Agger-Henderson etc. This accomplishes two things. First, it gets Hearts out of position, and makes it easier to carve up their defense. Second, it tires them out, a benefit we will start to see around the 60th minute.

I'm hoping Asylum really picks them back up and gets me excited for seeing more of them.

I totally disagree with you on the Cybermen though. The Rise/Age two-parter got me really geared up for them, but then they got massively overshadowed by the Daleks in their next appearance. At that point they weren't in another episode until The Next Doctor, which I thought was just okay. The giant Cyberman was a little bit too hard to believe for me. At that point, apart from small cameos, they weren't around all the way until Closing Time, which I thought was an extremely shoddy episode for them. The episode was fine enough to give us some more about Craig and introduce us to Stormageddon, but I really felt like the Cybermen were just there for the sake of being there.

For example, it says:

&gt;Lawyers for Mr Assange tell a UK extradition hearing there is a risk of ""denial of justice"" if the Wikileaks founder is tried for rape in Sweden. They accuse the prosecutor of having a ""biased view"" against men.

It doesn't explain if he was really at a risk of 'denial of justice' or not, just that his lawyers said that. His lawyers could have said 'he as at the risk of turning into a penguin' and that BBC article would have had to cite it.

Adam had a pretty good game. Bit sloppy at times but was a good driving force and made some nice long passes. Corner taking abilities weren't great. Looked a bit knackered towards the end, I assume the booing from Hearts fans is because he's ex-Rangers? 

Spearing made one really good pass... but was invisible for the rest of the game before going off. In fact same goes for Hendo. Still doesn't really work on the right, can we stop playing him there. 

Overall it wasn't a good performance,  fortunate to have got the goal... was enough though and from a team that really only has a few first-teamers in.

true,LandGod,null,null,"Wait a minute, it all makes sense now! Pokemon is set on the planet of Gallifrey (far preceding when the doctor was born of course)! Pokeballs are obviously Time Lord technology since they must be bigger on the inside. If we assume that the events depicted by the Pokemon games and TV shows took place hundreds (if not thousands) of years before the great time war and all that, is explains why this technology is so rudimentary compared to what we see in Dr. Who.

Pokemon could depict ancient Gallifrey before the Time Lords discovered space travel and time travel and all that other fun stuff. And it's not so outlandish to think that in the intervening centuries Pokemon could have been hunted to extinction or died out for some other reason. 

People always wonder why kids were allowed to go out on their own with dangerous monsters all over the place in Pokemon land, but if they had the ability to regenerate when near death, then that would explain why nobody seemed to mind. It also seems pretty plausible that on the same planet where the Time Lords evolved there were also animals who were fairly hard to kill and had other strange properties. This explains Pokemon and the fact that they faint all the time but don't seem to die very much. 

Oh and lets not forget that there are red trees and bushes in some areas of the Pokemon universe and there most certainly are areas with red trees and bushes on Gallifrey. The prevalence of such varied and dangerous creatures as Pokemon also helps explain how a race such as the Time Lords would have evolved in the first place. That's a lot of evolutionary pressure when you've got flying dragons that breath fire!

Also time lords and humans look alike, so that works, and the Time Lords' long life-spans help explain why Ash and friends never seem to age.

If we get M'Vila, too, then I'd be much more comfortable with this. My reasoning is we don't have the kind of quality depth in the center that we need, and a player like M'Vila would be fantastic going forward and defending. Combine his good passing skills with Moutinho's superb passing skills and high work rate and our midfield will be fantastic. 

Having M'Vila would also give is more tactical depth. Parker isn't as good going forward, and Livermore needs more experience before he can be relied on at a high level. Sandro is good, but paired with M'Vila in a 4-2-3-1 would be amazing.

FFS people.

UEFA rules state that each club must have a minimum of 4 players trained by the club for 3 years between 15 and 21 years of age.
They must have a minimum of 8 players trained in England for 3 years between their 15th and 21st birthdays. Since club grown is also England grown they count as 4 for that as well. 
UEFA imposes this to promote youth leagues and homegrown talent.

Their points seem to be:

1. Putin should resign / stop meddling in the church ('away' could mean out of office or out of the church).

2. The church is materialist, and governed by an ex-KGB chief, and in cahoots with the state.

3. The state is homophobic and locks up protesters and restricts freedom.

4. The Virgin Mary should be a feminism icon, and a symbol for change in the church.

5. The last two verses are a bit lost in translation but they seem to be talking about corrupt religious teachers

6. ... and something about the Patriarch fearing God.

So they have a message. They've also made additional points in [the closing statement at their trial](http://chtodelat.wordpress.com/2012/08/08/yekaterina-samutsevich-closing-statement/). It's an erudite deconstruction of Putin's relationship with the cathedral and religion in general.

My grades are quite good (so far, well above a weighted 4.0 gpa, which I'm not sure if they consider) but that could, of course, change this year. 

The personal statement is probably quite similar to the application essays we write here.

As for an interview, I should be able to go to the UK whenever, I'm not sure if  would need a visa just for an interview (I travel internationally somewhat often to Europe, so in assuming going to England wouldn't be much of a hassle -- I'll check up on it.)

Sure, natural intelligence and skill is important. There are people who are highly intelligent, but are lazy or have negative personality traits.

Think realistically, if harder exams were introduced into UK to filter the diamonds from the dirt, then what would they do with all that mood? People won't employ them, they won't be given the chance to learn those practical life skills. Basically, more poverty and more crime.

What about the disabled? Soon, it will lead to inequality. Sure, the education system is marginally better than pants, but we don't need to exclude those who put in effort.

I know a girl who has brain damage, she pushed herself enough to get decent grades. Should she be left to have a terrible job and live a poor quality of life.

I didn't get the best grades. I'm bad with numbers. I can't even tell the time. I managed a high C, a few off a B. I had effort and motivation.

In reality, people wouldn't adjust, people would still be looking for above C's for jobs. Thousands of people not making it.

I was partly wrong so for clarification.

Sterling is very promising but he's not ready to start in the league on a regular basis.  He is either a very good option off the bench or is going to go out on loan.

A parallel world isn't ""looks exactly the same disregarding all logic"" it's having a bizarre reflection of our world.

The Cybus Cybermen are *vastly* different from the Mondasian Cybermen in so many ways. 

Their design is not alien, but is notably terrestrial in nature. They came from an Earth not too far into the future compared to ours. They have shown no capability of intergalactic travel or the capability to expand on a galactic scale (the Doctor *directly* notes how these Cybermen will simply stagnate after completing their goal of conversion and make no technological progresses). They have shown no allergies to gold and have many abilities (like the electroshock hand) that the Mondesian Cybermen simply do not posses.

The Mondesian Cybermen have not, do not, and have no reason to look like the Cybus Cybermen. It's a huge leap in logic to have these creatures who have been established as decidedly *not* being the Cybermen we already knew be suddenly indistinguishable from their Mondas bretheren.

I mean, it  pulls you right out of the story. 

There's no reason that these Mondas Cybermen would look like Cybus Cybermen except for ""we reused the same costumes"".

Yeah, because that's how stories work. You can believe that there's hyperspace and lightsabers and the Force but when an army of clone duplicates of the bounty hunter who attempted to assassinate a Republic Senator at the behest of the Federation is deemed as ""probably not connected to the Federation at all"" by every character that should know better you see the faulty logic.

Stories work that way. I can believe that Superman can fly and shoot lasers out of his eyes but can't believe him lifting up an island of Kryptonite. You can believe some things that lie down the world and the story, but when there are snarls of logic as the story is told within the rules of itself it starts to tear at the story's believability.

Peep Show and The Thick of It are pretty worthy contenders with amazing writing &amp;amp;amp; performances. The Vicar Of Dibley is not really my kinda show but it's very good. 
Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights was great. I'm Alan Partridge. Nathan Barley. 15 Storeys High. The Smoking Room. 

Blackadder is older than 20 years. Best parts of Red Dwarf probably are as well. Same with Only Fools And Horses.

The Day Today and Brass Eye aren't sitcoms so I can't really compare them. If it's ALL comedy then, Vic &amp;amp;amp; Bobs various shows, NMTB when Lamarr was still presenter, HIGNFY when the cokehead was still presenter, Qi, Ali G Show, various Charlie Brooker shows, The People vs. Jerry Sadowitz, Mock The Week when Frankie Boyle was still funny.

Now, the actual reason is quite simple: why spend money making a new design and new props when you can keep continuity and not annoy anybody but a few diehard fans?

true,DenningLJ,null,null,"Unfortunately, there is no requirement to recognise them as a same sex marriage and they would not be 'downgraded' to civil partnerships either as a a partnership is a completely separate legal entity with a host of different laws regulating it. It follows the same precedent as other marriage's that are not recognised in the UK, i.e. bigamists, bellow the age of consent etc. 

I guess the really interesting questions come about when a same sex couple marry in Scotland, move south of the boarder, have a mortgage, a couple of kids, a Labrador etc and then split up. Agree or not, the legislation provides for marriage between one man and one woman, if the couple were to split they could not rely on the laws regarding divorce and equity or the break down of a civil partnership with regards to the assets. 

I guess the saving grace in this is the principals of the legislation surrounding divorce are being used more and more as a template when deciding in cases of couples who have lived together as though they are man and wife even if they have not been married, a judge who is not a full basket short of a cutlery draw would at a guess apply the same principals and treat it as a sort of divorce...hopefully. I say hopefully as there would be zero requirement to do so but the harsh fact is that they would be seen as simply co-habiting as a same sex couple. 

If people fancy downvoting, write to your fucking MP, don't click a button a forum when someone is proving facts when requested because you disagree with the principal of the information.

The punishment for getting caught with a bit of weed you just bought and for growing a plant or two are exactly the same. Fixed fines and cautions are equivalent to being told off for being naughty. For the vast majority of people, they're meaningless and will have no effect on their life. The amount of money you save from growing your own is more than the fine.

Borini, I felt did okay.  He was isolated most of the games.  He also missed that one sitter.  However, I felt that his movement as a striker is really good and gets into good area to score.  Those movement either later went offside or players didn't play the penetrating pass to allow him in.  Too many time last year there would be no striker/forward in the area to receive the pass or cross.  I find lots of the criticism for him is harsh.  Just mainly two below average performance and the knives are on him.  Whereas Carroll has many bad performance at Liverpool and it is usually he will turn good, we need him to be fit, he needs time to fit in.

Henderson was non-existant for most of the game and having him at the right is not the best position.  Made safe pass and kept the ball well, but was hardly involved for most of the game.

Adam, Spearing, and Shelvey were terrible.  Adam played too many Hollywood passes that went nowhere.  And Spearing makes too many bad simple passes that leads to opponent counters.  And Shelvey seems to be learning the bad habits of Adam recently.  Makes rash tackles and making more hollywood passes that are poor.

Allen looked good when he came in.  And settle the central midfield down and showed composure.

Carra seems past his time and looked slow.

Kelly, Agger, and Robinson did decent jobs.

In the form of the National Guard, states in fact have incredibly powerful armed forces. The Texas and Californian National Air Guard can call on more considerable air power than many European countries such as Croatia. In economic terms, California had a GDP of $1.8 trillion in 2010, higher than all but four European states and 13% of U.S. GDP. Lastly in terms of political parties, the two national parties in the U.S. resemble the groups of the European Parliament than parties in individual European states. A southern Democrat is likely to share more in common with a republican from his own state than either will with a member of their own party from the North. State parties have a huge ammount of freedom from the national leadership, and often vary wildly in policy terms. Just look at the Blue Dogs and RINOs for examples.

We can speculate all we like about whether he is good enough or not, but we're not the ones that see him in training day-in-day-out. 

He certainly has talent and ability, but he has only really stood out at reserve for Liverpool and U-19 level for Spain. When i saw him in the preseason friendlies he looked way off the pace, and unable to cope physically. He still has a long way to go i think. He could do with a loan spell to the Championship 

Every football club has one or two kids that the fans want to see in action, but i think fans are way too impatient, particularly when its a club like Liverpool and the manager is expected to be challenging for honors every season.

true,nowonmai666,lfc99,null,"&gt;In a daring move BR brought on struggling left winger Downing and gave him a run at left back, there has been talk that Liverpool only having one decent LB in Erique but should the time come can we rely on Downing?

The finer minds in this subreddit have been discussing this very idea for some time. It looks like at a pinch we can get away without signing cover for Enrique, using either Robinson or Downing depending on the exact balance of attacking or defending nouse that's required.

I've never doubted Downing's work-rate when it comes to pressing, marking and trying to win the ball back: his problems have been a lack of confidence to beat his man or play that killer pass. The full-back role changes the balance of pressure and may be good for him mentally.

The question is whether he already has or can learn the right kind of concentration to not get caught out of position or be playing people onside. That'll come down to game time in that position and leadership from Agger and Reina, but I think he will prove more useful at left back than inside right.",0,1345799986,null,0,false,0,c5xzykj,t3_yq8pv,t1_c5xzykj,t3_yq8pv,null,1429722645,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

**When the police use penalty notices**

Penalty notices are used for smaller offences that would usually get a fine in court. For example:

* theft from a shop
* cannabis possession
* being drunk and disorderly in public

You cannot choose whether or not to accept a penalty notice. If is for the police to decide if you should be given one. If you pay the penalty then you cannot get a criminal conviction for the offence listed on your penalty notice ticket. A penalty notice isn’t part of your criminal record, but it may be disclosed on a Criminal Records Bureau enhanced disclosure if it’s considered relevant.

...

**Cautions and criminal records**

A caution is not a criminal conviction, but it does go on your criminal record.

The police will record your caution on their databases. This means that your caution may in some circumstances be told to an employer or used in court as evidence of bad character. The police will also keep a record of photographs, fingerprints and any evidence taken in your case.

If you are cautioned for a sexual offence, you could be placed on the sex offenders register.

The police may give your name and address to any victims of your crime if they ask for it. This means you might be sued for damages by a victim.

The worst thing, lack of money even when working a job the entire way through uni but in fairness I did waste that money myself (tip, always make sure you have enough money for rent, bills and food. Everything else is supplementary although at the time you won't think that).

3) You will be dropped in at the deep end. You will get here and your first night you will probably end up going out and getting wrecked with your new housemates, do it, this is the best way to make friends. Please don't sit in alone feeling homesick because that genuinely sucks, remember everyone is in the same boat as you and no one knows anyone. Also lecture-wise your knowledge level will have to increase way beyond what you learnt at A level, but don't worry, literally all you have to do is pass your first year it doesn't count to your overall grade. 

As for societies, I think a lot of it depends on what you're into. There are your degree based societies which are pretty good for getting to know people on your course but can be a bit lax on actually having socials and contacting people. Then you have other societies like dance and choir etc, your performing arts type societies. And of course your charity socs like RAG and the Hitch.

Secondly, why does he feel the need to say that the school he is at is ""we are everything you hate and everything you would like to abolish""? That just sounds like he is intentionally villifying himself.

Thirdly, He states that his students have worked hard enough and ""earned"" a C grade, but many got D's. That is hardly fucking surprising. One grade either way of a prediction is not exactly a statistical anomaly. If they were predicted B's and got D's, then I would be more worried.

Fourthly:

&gt; you have put pressure on exam boards to ensure that only a certain number of students achieve a C grade or above.

That is how it has *always* worked to some extent or another. The results taken are fed into a statistical program that adapts grade boundaries based on a histogram; I think they call these adapted marks ""UMS"" marks although I could have misremembered. The idea behind this is to take out any factor of a specific test being too easy or too hard relative to other tests, and to show the student's performance in some respects relative to their peers as opposed to absolute.

In time Sterling and will undoubtedly be a lot better than Downing, but he needs to learn some of the game's fundamentals before he can start games regularly. Same for Suso. 

And as for your point that if you don't give them time in the first team, we wont know. Rodgers and the coaching staff know better than us. In this day and age football clubs use incredibly extensive player performance analysis techniques. Rodgers in particular is known for his meticulous eye for such detail.

&gt;So how did the above deal effect the Parliament of today? Well let’s compare their profits and losses. The cost to maintain the royal family today is £40 million pounds per year as we mentioned before. But the revenue paid to the UK from the Royal lands is 200 million. So £200 million in revenue subtract £40 million in salary costs equals £160 million pounds in profit. That’s right: The Great Britain earns 160 million pounds in profit, every year from the Royal Family.

&gt;So stop all your moaning about the Royal family and how much they cost and how worthless they are. The Royal Family is Great for Great Britain.

&gt;Doing the individual’s math again: £160 million pounds divided by 62 million people is about £2.60 per person. So Because of the Royal Family, your taxes are actually £2.60 cheaper each year than they would otherwise be.

Suso would probably do well with a loan spell but I think he would also be helped by watching Sahin for a year.  If you are looking for a player for Suso to be modeled after, Sahin would be a good template.

Sahin broke into the Dortmund team at 16 but then sort of faded until he went on loan to Feyenoord at 19.  When he came back he was straight into the first team.  It's the path for so many players in that playmaker role.  Andrea Pirlo, Xabi Alonso, Sahin, Jack Wilshire and Tom Cleverly all made a few first team appearance for their parent club and then went on at least one loan spell sometime between when they were 17-20.  That would seem to be a logical path for Suso, too.

My hope is that he develops into a DM and cover for Lucas.  Lucas came up at Gremio as a box-to-box midfielder in a 4-4-2 which is similar to how Henderson played at Sunderland.  Once he got here it was clear that that isn't a role he can play at this level and that isn't a role that many top teams even use any more.  He isn't a winger but he is an efficient passer and not a bad tackler so if his reading of the game improves he could become very similar to Lucas.  We don't have any real cover for that position (Spearing doesn't cut it) so there is an opportunity there.

&gt; Gove has demanded that Cs are marked down to Ds

Has he though? Has he really? Teachers appear to be saying this but it appears groundless to me. There's no evidence of him doing so and he's denied it. Grades have been going up and up for many years, it's no surprise that trend didn't continue ad infinitum.

&gt; These kids, who worked their arses off but only got to a C-level because they have English as a second-language

Do you know what exams are for? They're for appraising *how good* someone is at something. If English is their second language, I'm really not surprised they're not so good at it. Does lack of an English GCSE stop you in life? No, it doesn't. You can easily explain away a poor mark in one subject, and especially when it is your second language.

If they did poorly, they don't deserve to be bumped up just because they're poor or immigrant or whatever. Exams are not designed for social easing.

&gt; They are prevented from getting on with their lives, condemned to sweeping the streets forever.

To say that is the difference between a C and a D grade is a crass exaggeration.

&gt; Not for lack of talent

There's no way you can say that. The teacher in question has undoubtably a rosy-eyed view of his class - of course he does. That's just *normal* - there's no way he can objectively assess their talents when he's that emotionally attached to them. But *you* have no idea of their raw talent; you don't know how much was there to start with, how well the teacher and teaching environment has coaxed it out of them, and you don't know how well they managed the exam itself.

&gt; and one more dick in a suit has decided that he'd rather preserve the good life for the rich than allow a few people to scrape a C and go to college to pick up a very modest career.
&gt; If you don't find this disgusting, you have no empathy.

Well, this is just utter bollocks. I have empathy for the kids; truly I do. But to blame the government is just batting away the responsibility.

The full Press Release:
&gt;Next year it will be 18 years since Richard Richard “Richie Richard” Richard and Eddie Hitler last graced our television screens. Long enough for a generation to be born, learn to walk and talk, grow up, go to school, nearly learn to read, leave school and register for job seekers’ allowance all without having experienced the wit and wisdom of two of comedy’s greatest characters.


&gt;All that is about to change as we find out what happened to two titans of comedy, Richie and Eddie. Are they still wandering round and round Hammersmith roundabout looking for a safe place to cross? Are they still living in one of the dirtiest and least hygienic flats uncondemned by Health and Safety? Are they still drinking neat furniture polish whilst hitting each other over the head with large metal objects, setting fire to each other’s private parts and other areas as they seek to impress gullible members of the opposite sex, and each other? Or are they down the pub?


&gt;No, they are abandoned, lost and shipwrecked on a tropical hell hole that is Hooligans’ Island, although they are still hitting each other over the head with large metal objects, still chasing women, (even though there are none on the island) and still waiting for that job seekers’ allowance cheque as they distil something quite like alcohol, only worse. And they are back on BBC Two in 2013 for **six new 30-minute episodes** starring Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson.


&gt;Be afraid. Be very afraid. And a bit bilious. Rik Mayall says: “How much am I getting paid? Are there any birds in it? And that horrific arse-brained Edmondson’s not in it again is he? Oh, God help me... no, no, alright then, I’ll do it. That useless, foul smelling waste of space and oxygen is really going to get it this time. This is the big one. Tell the audience to brace themselves.” Ade Edmondson said: “It’s been a while since I last worked with that complete b****** Rik Mayall and I’m very much looking forward to bashing him about the head with various blunt objects. It’s the only language he understands.

They have Jon Plowman producing it though, who done series 3 of Bottom as well as PsychoVille.",0,1345812720,null,0,false,0,c5y1gi6,t3_yqz0y,t1_c5y1gi6,t3_yqz0y,null,1429723351,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

I'm really speaking from experience on this one as well. A couple of weeks ago I recruited for a 1st Line Tech Support role and had (about) 40 applicants come in.  Skipping the boring stuff, about 5 of them reached a telephone interview stage. This simple process involved a ten minute call to discuss the role, the client and the candidates suitability. 

Of the two candidates *not* invited to a final face-to-face interview - both of them were rejected on the grounds that they hadn't done any research / didn't know anything about the company and sounded uninterested in the role. Both were surprised to hear the feedback when I told them. 

Of the other three, two got offers.

So I hope you can see how much ""not having time to commit"" may lose your chance at the role. Both of the candidates rejected for these reasons could have landed the job (and did have relevant skills) if they had only tried.

true,Chief_Master,lfc68,,"Its not that Downing is better than Sterling solely by virtue of his age, but age and experience bring dimensions to a players game that younger players don't have. 
One of the major differences between younger and older players is their mentality. While young players are refreshing in the sense that they're generally fearless and eager, they generally haven't developed positioning and decision making that you need at the highest level. Particularly in Rodger's system players like Sterling and Suso need to know when to play the simple pass and retain possession, and when to run at the defence. 

You don't quite seem to understand the argument i'm making - Downing isn't as talented as Sterling. Sterling undoubtedly has the potential to be a far better player than Downing. But he isn't yet. Sterling has the dribbling and pace that makes him eye catching, but he doesn't yet possess the more subtle elements to his game that he will eventually develop. 
Playing youngsters in the first team is only a small part of how they're developed. They need to be gradually introduced, but only when they're physically and mentally capable. Other aspects of their development are just as, if not more, important. The day-to-day training, experience in reserves, on loan, etc is extremely important.

Couple of observations:
Hazard could be a fantastic acquisition - if this level of quality can continue, and he doesn't get sussed by oppo, we could have a proper gem.

Oscar - quick, direct. Not quite as in tune with us/PL football as Hazard seems to be, but again, if this level can continue/improve it bodes well.

Torres. He is now the obvious striker choice, with no shadow over him He should be playing with a smile and his head up, so why wasn't he? He only looked interested after his tap in. I'll be watching him closely on Saturday.

Lampard made some uncharacteristically sloppy passes, which a team with more quality could have punished further. Also, the quickness of Hazard/Oscar/Mata are showing how much pace he has lost. His brain hasn't slowed, but his body has. I hope he can adapt his game to his loss of pace, and his team mates quickness, as I do not want him to become a liability.

Defence - carved open far too easily. Big gap between the defence and the Mikel/Lampard pairing, which gave Reading space to operate. Terry also is slower than he was (and he was never blindingly quick) and I can see that becoming an issue unless we have a quicker defensive partner, or the screening midfielders help out.

I hope that Cech's howler does not mean a return to his run of poor form from last season, as Ross Turnbull is not a replacement.

It's going to be an interesting season.

true,endedwiggin,null,null,"I'm an American student who will starting Oxford for chemistry this fall, so let me know if you have any questions in particular. phys1cs seems to do a great job of covering the logistics of applying. The one quirk of UCAS, as compared to the Common App, is that to get a reference from a teacher you simply provide the teacher's email and the rest of the communication will be between that teacher and UCAS. 

I also did not have IB program at my school, and took AP, SATs, and SAT IIs. My understanding of the requirements they give you is that they are the absolute minimum to have a remotely competitive application. You sound like you will be taking more than enough APs. I took 9. Something to note is that they care far more about APs in the relevant subjects than they do about those in English or History. I got 4's in both English APs and still was fine. 

Also, as far as I could tell, they don't care remotely about extracurricular activities if they aren't in some way related to your subject. I swam on the school team for all four years, and didn't mention it on the application. Another things is that they also don't particularly care about class grades. I never put mine on my application, and my school never sent a transcript. You could put them if they would help (under module grades, I think), but mine would not have (to put it mildly). 

These last two factors allowed me to have a much more competitive application at Oxford (or any other English university) than I would at top tier American universities. If you are the type of person who performs well on tests, this could definitely be for you.

I skyped for my interview, mostly for cost reasons because I didn't think my chances were good, and it went fine. There was a slight bit of awkwardness because everything we wrote was inverted by the camera and a personally interview would be quite the experience, but skype sufficed.

true,MattHardwick,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"Just had a nice long chat with our cheif registrar. She's a very nice lady with some clever ideas and sorry she can't help me/you anymore but...

As it stands the General Registrar has not been officially made aware of plans in Scotland, so they are some time off even being allowed to make a decision in this country. Essentially no decision has been made. So at the moment, at most, a same sex marraige in Scotland would at most be recognised as a civil partnership.

Under UK (currently including Scotland) law marraige, no matter what country it was performed in, must be ""between one man and one woman"". It's that one man one woman legislation that is the hard bit to change, as The Lords have the power to veto any changes unquestioned, and often do. Civil Partnership only managed to get in after years of pinning sentences and clauses onto minor changes of a wide set of legislations.

For all intents and purposes a Civil Partnership is the same, and in many respects ahead of marraige legally, and is actually MORE of a committment than marraige despite the perceptions to the contrary. The ceremony is almost the same two with the removal of the line ""the law in this country states that marriage is a union between one man and one woman"" and the removal of the traditional register (replaced with a schedule, which is much more fitting to today's society).

Hope that help clears things just a little.

&gt;Well, this is just utter bollocks. I have empathy for the kids; truly I do. But to blame the government is just batting away the responsibility.

Okay so the majority of teachers whose pupils have recieved a lower than predicted grade have just been slacking off and not bothered to teach? You clearly have no idea how hard teachers work and how difficult it is to teach in some of those schools. Because of this difference in grades, teachers are now in the firing line, and will most likely be blamed for marking generously or for not teaching hard enough.

It is easy to blame the government because they are to blame for this. If a kid is predicted a grade, then the teacher is confident that they can attain that level and the kids are pretty much guaranteed to get that grade unless they fuck up massively. The predicted grade isn't just an arbitrary number/letter, it is based on the current level a pupil is working at. So much time, energy and effort is put into preparing these kids for their exams, so to have such a MASSIVE and significant drop in levels is evident of some level of foul play somewhere.

Morientes was coming in from a different league, so it's not always easy to translate the contribution, and as for Adam, I think there's an argument that he doesn't play the same position as he did at Blackpool. Going from an AM to a CM will always result in fewer goals. Obviously there are factors like pressure and expectation involved.

What I know is if Dempsey comes he'll play in his preferred position on the wings, he's played in the prem for 6 seasons now and over that time has improved on his goal haul every single year.

It was a normal sized secondary school of around 700 pupils (140-150 per year).  The only thing about it to distinguish it at first glance from many schools is that it was in a quiet village rather being in the middle of a town or city, and drew most of it's pupils from the many surrounding villages.

Both staff and students put in the effort, and wanted to be there.  The results and rewards spoke for themselves.  I'm not saying everyone there was perfect, there were some bad apples, but at least 85-90% of students applied themselves. 

That attitude was completely different to any inner city school I've ever come across.  We occasionally had visits to other schools in the county, in addition to encountering them at rugby/cricket games and what stood out to me was how little anyone cared.

In my opinion, the problem is the attitudes to learning (and in general) of the parents (a lot of whom are no doubt on benefits and haven't worked a day in their lives)/pupils.

OH! I see. Players you put into the squad roster can count, however most clubs don't put players under 21 into the squad roster because they don't have to. This allows them to save space since 25 can be a bit restricting. 

The trick is they have to be at least 18 years old, and trained at Liverpool since they were at least 15. (Or 19 - 16, etc.) 

In that case, it's still understandable they would choose Spearing. He apparently doesn't mind sitting on the bench a fair amount, he's club grown, commands small wages yet he's good enough that they can play him against tougher sides when they need to use him.

The point is that if you look at [the first one](http://img.ibtimes.com/www/data/images/full/2012/05/31/278265.png), housing prices have risen far, far faster than general inflation or other commodities (proxied here by comparing them to the increase in retail prices) - faster than inflation would generally have caused them to rise.

The second graph indicates a likely reason why - we all know that there was a ""housing bubble"", where prices were inflated far above their sensible value, but (as usual) people were largely only willing to accept that conclusion in retrospect (once the crash had happened and it was unavoidable).

Similarly, bubbles followed by crashes often follow a fairly distinct pattern (demonstrated by [the second graph](http://www.arabianmoney.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/manias-bubbles.jpg)):

1. A slight but pronounced rise, as whatever effects are causing the bubble kick into gear.
2. After some growth, a sudden loss of confidence in some pessimistic investors as they decide the growth can't continue for much longer, at which point the market takes a small dip.
3. Not enough distrust is prevalent, however, to offset the bubble, so after a small dip in which ""the pessimists have been proven wrong"", freed of all that bothersome doubt and caution it takes off in earnest - practically exponentially.
4. The market peaks, as everyone who can possibly get in on the action has done so, and prices are achieving ludicrous levels.
5. A pronounced (but ultimately comparatively small) dip, in which the first signs that exponential growth can't continue forever become apparent.  People first start getting their fingers burnt, and people first start talking seriously about a crash or a recession.
6. A small rally, as after some losses a small cadre of optimists decide that the market has already self-corrected, and decide to get in on the ground floor while prices are ""cheap"".
7. Not enough optimism exists, however, and prices are still ridiculously inflated, so eventually the optimists run out of optimism, and the market's inevitable downward inertia overcomes their naive hopes it was all over.
8. A huge, crushing crash as the market falls back to the sort of level it *would* have been at by now without the bubble distorting it.

Notice the pattern there?  Everyone assumes that the way it is is the way it's going to continue to be, until they literally *can't deny* that their previous assessments were inaccurate.

Then they quickly (and prematurely) decide that whatever minimal corrective action the market's *already* taken is sufficient, and declare the current situation the new ""normal"", even though it's merely a temporary reprieve.  Then the *big* change takes over, and this time (having already been discredited once recently) there's no pessimism/optimism left to ameliorate or restrain it.

Pessimists are discredited in the rise and optimists in the crash, but either way ""conventional thinking"" in both cases:

* Is purely reactive, recognising what *has* happened but signally failing to predict what *will*, and
* Under-estimates the degree of market distortion (first the degree of inflation and then the size of the correction necessary to correct it), and is too quick to declare the ""new normal"" after the first tiny, temporary fluctuation in the trend.

Basically, if you want to look at how badly inflated the housing market is in the UK, consider equivalent measures of wealth and prosperity (retail prices for various commodities, inflation, etc), or look at the trend before the bubble occurred.

Both seem to indicate that housing prices *even now* are still perhaps two or three times their ""sustainable"" value (had the bubble never happened).  By comparison, the market has so far ""corrected"" by between perhaps a fifth or a tenth at most.",0,1345824837,null,0,1345825117,0,c5y4c0k,t3_yquvn,t1_c5y4c0k,t1_c5y3twt,null,1429724715,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

15 foreign players, 8 homegrown. 23 players total, who are over the age of 21. No exclusions needed for this squad list, I think. U21 players omitted, as their inclusion is assumed.

CL:

GK: Cech, Turnbull, Hilario  
DF: Ivanovic, Cole, Luiz, Cahill, Terry, Bertrand, Azpilicueta  
MID: Essien, Ramires, Lampard, Mata, Mikel, Meireles, Marin, Moses, Romeu, Hazard  
ST: Torres, Sturridge

Malouda, Benayoun, Ferreira are fairly obvious exclusions. Oscar does not make my cut given his young age and lack of experience with the European game. Qualified U21 players omitted, as their inclusion is assumed. Since we have one club trained player (Terry) and 4 association trained players, we are allowed to list a total of 22 players.

****

In conclusion, I think it's high time we sold Malouda and Benayoun. Malouda has not been able to contribute significantly to the team since the middle of last season. Benayoun may still be quality, and his versatility and experience may come in handy, but he'd have to be okay with not playing any CL football.

We could add another player (two, really) but for any new signing, we would have to sell off a corresponding player to be able to play them in the CL. Makes it a bit tricky to add anyone else this year I think, although Meireles may be expendable.

Due to recent successes, Chelsea have also developed a rivalry with Manchester United.

* You should despise anyone who says, ""Your club doesn't have a history."" You should also tell such morons, ""You are morons and you know nothing about football, so, shut up!"" Word of warning: I'd advise the latter only if you can handle yourself in a fist-fight.

* Chelsea's 'nemesis' would probably be Tottenham but that's ascribable to geography. League-positioning and 'fan-aticism' wise, it would probably be Manchester United &amp; Arsenal. Money-spending wise, it would be Man City, PSG &amp; Anzhi Makhachkala. 

* Everton is probably Chelsea's bogey going by the results in the recent seasons. I shit bricks when Chelsea play Everton.

* No pre-written or unwritten rules. Look around, ask questions, have a good time. Don't get offended by the 'banter' you hear - it can get downright nasty and may seem as a cultural shock even, but it is all in good spirit.

You could also consider Manchester United another rival as they were the team that we competed with for a lot of our success in the mid 2000s, most notably in the Champions League final loss in 2008. We've also had a few crazy games with Liverpool in European competition as well. Some more historic rivals would be Millwall and Leeds but those rivalries go back a bit farther and I don't want to tell you bad info, so maybe someone else can fill you in there.

I sort of consider Barca to be our main European rivals from another league. Our champions league clashes have always been exciting (albeit controversial).

As far as songs go, Keep The Blue Flag Flyin. High and Blue is the Colour are absolute musts. You can find them on YouTube. Nothing on this earth beats celebrating a win with a song and a pint.

When you can, watch some matches (or at least highlights) of some of our older players that no longer play for us. Zola, Makelele, Hasselbaink, Gudjohnsen etc. Zola is probably the greatest player to ever play for us. Didier Drogba may also contend for that title as well.

Extremely likely, yes - that's why I'm still conflicted about it.

I find myself in the awkward position of an arms dealer in the middle of a civil war - as long as I and/or my partner can stay employed throughout the recession (and given our respective industries that's a pretty good bet) we stand to be in an excellent position to take advantage of developments.  However, those developments would also necessarily make life very tough for people in general.

I don't want to tempt fate, but with no property, no debts and decent cash savings in the bank there's little (that I'm I'm aware of) that a recession would realistically do *directly* apart from causing me to lose my job (and as I said, that's fairly unlikely given my industry) or taking down a major bank (and even then, our money's split over several).

I don't want harm to come to anyone, but I seriously suspect that it's going to happen anyway, and we only exacerbate it by delaying the full market correction it even further.

Critical Thinking is about the process of arriving at reasoned judgements, which can be properly explained and supported.

Basically, we were taught how to argue and make our cases well. How to think about things from all angles, and properly analyse things. 

My teacher used to work for a large media empire at one point, so he knew the ins and outs of persuasive language, and could teach so incredibly well. Especially helpful, because a large portion of our course involved the media. Probably the most intelligent man I've ever met.

The problem is I don't know if Flanagan or Robinson have been at Liverpool the required 3 years to count.

*Jack Robinson is only 18 but he should count.

I think the argument against it would be... are they worth putting into the 25 man squad? I mean that's his decision but keeping Spearing would be more ideal, caveat being of course that Spearing is quality enough for it which he isn't.

I must be honest, I'm basing this on my memory of a Guardian article on this guy from about five months ago, but I'm relatively certain that they made a point of explaining that 'indecent exposure' isn't an actual specific concrete law that prohibits nudity.

Completely with you on this, however, there is a big difference between making the behaviour stop and throwing his naked ass in jail for six years (he has explicitly said that if he is simply allowed to leave the prison as he is he would go home and put on clothes and, most likely, not go out naked again - again, I am basing this on his interview with the guardian from a few months ago)  
  
 &gt;that last part superceeds any inherent naturism yearnings.  
  
Again, I think that you are completely right, here. I will, however, say that I think it goes beyond just his naturist yearnings at this point. Ultimately, this isn't just him enjoying being naked, it's him making a point of refusing to buckle to a sentiment that he truly believes in his heart of hearts is morally wrong and harmful, the idea that the human body is inherently offensive and disgusting. His family are unfortunate innocent victims of his campaign, and whether or not their suffering supercedes the importance of his campaign (for lack of a better term) is another question all together from whether or not he deserves to be in jail.",0,1345831034,null,0,false,0,c5y638q,t3_ypa5e,t1_c5y638q,t1_c5y2j59,null,1429725533,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

You can of course apply 'open', which many international students do, and the university will assign you to a college at the interview stage. However, contrary to what some university brochures may tell you, there are significant differences between colleges. They aren't so much differences of quality (however you define that). But the differences - of geographic location, social atmosphere, architectural style, academic strength in your subject, style of governance, distribution of students by subject, diversity, quality of library and facilities, strength in sport, etc. - are there. All of this means it's worthwhile to take a look at the college profiles in the official and alternative brochures, and maybe even their Wikipedia pages (or google maps!), to think about a choice.

Both are vital to society, one just had a better life start than another when you examine the social backgrounds of doctors and nurses. Same with solicitors and barristers or any two tier profession. 

Doctors are not selfless paragons of virtue. And much like there is a reason I work for a legal aid firm and not a massive private practise there is a reason doctors work for the NHS and not for a private practise: They aren't good enough/didn't know the right people/didn't go to the right university. A minority might have principles about working for the public rather than private but thats a case of post hoc ergo hoc.

If you do really well there they will give some money, but its not much, especially compared to the international tuition. Apparently you still can get aid from US federal programs though, despite going overseas. Its always worth trying, though I wouldn't count on it.

Oh, and one other large difference is the idea of the conditional offer. That applies to all British universities, though, and is explained well on UCAS. Basically, if you apply with your junior year scores they will give you an offer of certain scores that you must meet on your senior year exams in order to get in.

Baseball is ideally suited to the kind of advanced statistical analysis that ""moneyball"" is built around.

But here's the thing: Moneyball is a guarantee. Hell, the fellows at the center of it when it became a thing, never used the term. Moneyball was the name of a non-fiction book that described to rise of statistical analysis as the basis for building a team. It used Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics as the focal point to give context and character to the story, but the ideas had been around for a couple of decades before Paul DePodesta and Billy Beane got together.

So, Commoli, the cunt. Hah! When FSG bought LFC, the ownership had zero experience in proper football and needed someone they felt comfortable with to guide them. That's Commoli, who was recommended to FSG by Billy Beane. But Commoli's problem is that he takes the numbers game too far in evaluating players. Unfortunately, it took a down seasons, despite the Carling Cup, and nearly a hundred million in cash to realize that.

There is value to statistical analysis in football, but it should not be the only way to make decisions on signings.

""Moneyball"" was a strategy (I'll get into what the strategy is in a bit) employed by Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics in the early 2000's.

Bill James is a baseball statistician that has been pumping out baseball statistics for the last 40 years. In 2003 he was hired by the Boston Red Sox to assist their analytics department.

Bill James has very little to do with Moneyball. Some of the advanced statistical concepts he created were likely used by Billy Beane and the A's, but that is it.

So what is Moneyball? In the early 2000's, the Oakland A's were (and still are) one of the poorest team's in baseball. They were looking for a way to compete with the higher-spending teams in baseball while operating with a fraction of their budget. They did this by eschewing many traditional notions and statics in baseball, and targeting undervalued pitchers. 

Their basic premise was that a lot of the traditional baseball statistics (errors, RBIs, batting average, wins/losses) didn't really help determine who was better than whom. A lot of them, for instance, are counting statistics, like wins. If you have two perfectly similar pitchers, but one is on a bad team and one on a good team, the pitcher on the good team will have a much better record. That doesn't mean he is a better pitcher, he just happens to have better batters on his team that score more runs, and thus he gets more wins. Wins isn't a good statistic to differentiate pitcher skill.

Beane happened upon a couple of interesting concepts. He posited that defensive skill was very overrated, and thus would target a player who could hit well but field abysmally. He thought that onbase percentage was a much more revealing statistic than average, and thus targeted high onbase percentage players. He felt that it was much easier to project the careers of college players than high school players, so the A's primiarly drafted college players they thought would succeed.

By using some of the concepts above, Billy Beane was able to sign players that other teams neglected. One of the common examples is Scott Hatteberg, who was released by the Boston Red Sox because he was so injured that he couldn't throw a baseball. He could still hit, however, and had a high onbase percentage, so Beane signed him. Since Beane thought defense was overrated, he stuck Hatteberg at first base and didn't care that he was poor fielder.

Thus, the answer to your question is an emphatic no. Brendan Rodgers seems to believe that playing an uptempo, high-possession style is the way to win games. This is not an undervalued strategy, and perhaps may even be overvalued, leading to anyone employing it to pay a premium for players that fit well into it.

I don't know anything about how Stoke chooses players, but they're probably the best example of a Moneyball-esque strategy currently in the EPL. While everybody is moving to possession-based football, Stoke signs bruising defenders and tall forwards that thrive on set pieces and long ball football. They're able to get good players for cheap because other teams don't believe those players have a place in the modern game.

Just support your club and make decisions on who you like and don't like based on your own perceptions. A herd mentality only goes so far. So just roll with the endless amount of punches that will come your way as a Chelsea fan

To be honest I have a similar issue with MLB, I have decided to get behind the Angels, for very few tangible reasons. But I'm feeling my way out with that. Primarily i feel I hate the yankee's because it seems that anyone other than balding date-rapists from within a 50 mile radius of Yankee stadium wouldn't support the yankee's  - unless they could't give a shit less about sport.

So in the same vein, follow Chelsea as a passionate hobby and see who you find yourself honestly disliking. I would bet money on the fact that you will end up disliking Man U, Arsenal, Liverpool, Spurs &amp;amp;amp; Man City. - but the joy is in learning to hate these teams for yourself!

You are correct in that Carroll, Henderson &amp; Downing don't follow the Moneyball pattern because they are big buys.

It was a way for a relatively poor team to compete with the big boys, not a strategy for a big boy like Liverpool.

You are incorrect in the strategy Commoli employed. From what I have read, he used a lot of advanced statistics, and believed that **chances created** was very important, and so he got players like Downing and Adam that had created a lot of chances in the prior year, and Andy Carroll to deposit those chances into the back of the net. The rest of the league wasn't so hip on chances created, so he was able to target players that otherwise weren't as in high of demand.

&gt; By re-evaluating the strategies that produce wins on the field, the 2002 Athletics, with approximately $41 million in salary, were competitive with larger market teams such as the New York Yankees, who spent over $125 million in payroll that same season. Because of the team's smaller revenues, Oakland is forced to find players undervalued by the market, and their system for finding value in undervalued players has proven itself thus far.

This is a critical part of the application process, particularly for competitive universities and courses like law, medicine, economics etc. Perhaps students would be prepared to pay maybe £15 (or so) for bespoke online help and advice on both course selection and writing a good personal statement. Universities may also wish to advertise or we could get a payment for referring students on to a website.

Obviously we would need someone to design a website with payment system and to allow customers to send messages and drafts of personal statements etc. 

Then, the query would be forwarded to the person who has relevant experience. For example, I got into LSE to study management, so I could obviously talk about LSE and management/business/economics. Perhaps someone else has studied English at Manchester. Or maybe you work in Engineering and could advise on this. Most people probably have some knowledge they can give to prospective students even if it is simply: 'dont do philosophy cause it sucks'. We could also be the first independent group to offer advice on universities BY students for students, rather than some meaningless league table by some people who just look at some statistics. This is good because students are cheap labour and can easily talk about their uni. Also, unlike at 'visit' they can talk anonymously and be able to give honest criticism.


What is good about this is that it feeds on our obvious strengths and skills. Also, the cost is justified as which course you apply for and the strength of the application makes a significant difference to life chances. You would probably pay a lot of money to avoid spending 3 years in a dump studying a course you hate. A short piece of advice from a recent grad could do wonders for a teen with no experience in medicine or whatever.

true,T3ppic,null,null,"7 years training. And its not stressful its generally work in a comfy clean environment where you can wear a suit (Hint: thats why there are so many applicants). Its the same as any top 50 university course. Quite literally. Otherwise they wouldn't be able to run the undergraduate course. A lavish estimate for doctor training is 100k. Now you could argue they deserve to earn more because they paid to train more. But considering cost of living a newly qualified doctor can make his investment back in 1.5 years. And then continue for the rest of his life earning that investment every 1.5 years. 

And lots of professionals do the same or even more hours, usually unpaid as interns, as doctors. Difference being those professionals are not guaranteed a 100k a year job (able to opt out of extra hours thanks to new contracts issued in 2009) and an index linked pension with a job for life in most cases. 

And why would they do it? Because their parents expected it of them. Because their family can afford to support them whilst training. And everyone respects a doctor more than say a solicitor when both are vital to society. 

Its called unionisation. Invented before socialism - a bunch of professionals get together and fix their wage scale by not allowing people to enter their job market except on the professionals terms. Most professions are ""unionised"" doctors, lawyers, pharmacists. Nothing about what they do is very ""stressful"" - its just a job. Said as a solicitor and son of a pharmacist. If you gave me a choice of being a doctor for 20k a year or a refuse collector for 50k a year guess what? Id be the doctor. 

You could halve the pay scale of the average new doctor and there would still be more applicants than there are need for doctors. Why? Because its not a life cleaning up shit in a nursing home. Nurses do far more hours and labour than doctors but, as I said, earn 3.2 million less over the course of a career. Why? College of Nursing is a fairly recent ""union"" when doctors have had the privilege to dictate who is a doctor for over 300 years and lawyers? Close to 700. 

A doctor is no more clever than John Prescott - Someone who left school with nothing, joined a union when the unions were powerful, got a scholarship to oxford and bing bang boom johnny two jags. When by rights he should be mixing cement for a living. Same sort of thing happens with all professions and unions - they aren't forced to face the open market.

I was in this position myself, I did quite well at GCSE and school suggested I take 5 AS levels (and then that I take 4 full A-levels). I refused. The people who did this did worse, as they were spread too thin. They also did not get into better universities. better to get 3 As than 2As and 2Bs (or whatever you are likely to get). Only the best 3 results matter, so ABB is the same as ABBC. or ABBBBBCCCCCCDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEEUUUUUUU. And most unis dont even count Crit. Thinking, so all it does is bump up the colleges average grades, it actually HURTS you.

Seriously, you can take 4AS and 3 A-levels and that is plenty. Oxbridge/LSE/russell group are happy with 3 A-levels and 4as-levels. And other unis are certainly happy with 4 then 3 (or even 3 and 3). I got into a very competitive uni with AABb, which was plenty of work. an extra A-level would have probably given me ABCc, not nearly as good.

Your college may pressure you into doing critical thinking but you should be really firm: they cannot make you do this. Just say that you are unable to study this much.

I would suggest A followed shortly by B - but only once. This will make sure your application gets sent again (assuming all is working as it should be) and then hopefully giving you someone to talk to directly about your application. 

Hopefully the recruiter you speak to will either consider your application since you're taking the time to phone, or at least give you a reason why you're not suitable if that is the case. Be mindful though - if the recruiter has received a lot of applications they may not be able to find yours in their inbox easily. On behalf of recruiters everywhere I'd ask you not to take that personally - it's not that you're important, it's that we might have to wade through up to hundreds of applications to find *yours*. 

PdRichmond raises a good point - it does show you're interested and sets you apart from those that haven't called and - again as they mentioned - if you aren't going to have a shot, at least you'll find out why. 

Whilst you're on the phone, see if you can find out ways you could improve your resume and whether they have any other suitable roles. 

But a word to the wise - don't *keep* calling. If there's no news, there's no news. Calling the recruiter even once a day isn't necessarily doing you any favors if they have to keep saying ""no"" to you.

Junior doctors work 48 hour weeks officially for around £22,000.  Unofficially its a lot more.  My 9-5 day used to start at 0800 and quite commonly finish at 1900.  

A nurses responsibility goes so far as calling a doctor.  If a nurse is worried about a patient the decision she has to make is whether to call a doctor or not.  As a doctor your next step could mean whether the patient lives, gets worse or dies.

The total duration of my training from the day I started university is 6 years for uni + 2 FY + 7 for specialist training = 15 years before I become a consultant.  Not everyone becomes a consultant.  There are plenty of exams and plenty of competition along the way, everyone is free to enter.

Well done sir. Far more eloquently put. Its amazing how well aware we are of trolling online but in real life we will literally pay to be trolled. We enjoy it. People actually love getting wound up by a newspaper they will buy. 

Its far more insidious than even 4chan trolling however. Via the media trolling people and the peoples ""right to respond"" (5 Live, Question Time, Any Questions) it cultivates the appearance we live in a vibrant thriving democracy where even the most lowly and uneducated could have an opinion that would change the world...

But no, its just trolling. You care? You lose either way. But it doesnt matter because as long as people can turn on Question Time once a week, whose content is provided by newspapers and not any relation to reality, to shout themselves hoarse at politicians and media pundits (IE trolls) they will carry on. 

Twitter and facebook have made the problem worse - producers will actually produce ""reality documentaries"" specifically to incite social media feedback because its advertising. So long as people think what they think matters the status quo will carry on. Freedom of the press has stifled not improved society because any lofty principles held by the media basically comes down to money and someone has worked out there is more money in inciting uproar than actually reporting reality. 

Everyone has an opinion on shit like Jeremy Kyle, the Daily Mail of TV shows, some people even watch it ""ironically"" doesn't actually improve anything. The highly medicated idiots on that show troll the rest of the us neither improving their lives or ours.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"Well, at the risk of jinxing this, I'm feeling quite positive about this game. At the risk of jinxing it further, I think that Peterborough are the kind of team that those chasing promotion need to beat, home and away. They are a good, attacking side, in fairness, but I think that they've always been frail in defence whenever they've appeared in the Championship and we should be able to exploit this. The fact that Ferguson transfer listed most of his team and still has several of those players who have yet to move on in and around his team (notably George Boyd) won't particularly help them.

I'll predict a 2-1 win for Leeds. I also suspect that Warnock will give the team a chance to redeem themselves, or else he'll entertain the thought of starting Diouf next time (he probably won't try it until he's signed a proper contract, though).

So here's my predicted line-up (right to left):

If you did invoke profiling it might well catch more criminals in the short term, but it's also going to make the 95% of the black population who are entirely law abiding feel like they are aliens in their own country. How many times can a decent kid get stopped in the street before he legitimately feels pissed off at the government and the police? I'd say 50 is way past the reasonable limit.

Some maths exam questions will require at least an entire page of working to reach the answer.

If you go through the rest of the answer correctly with no errors in the method, understanding the process, it would be very harsh to lose all marks for the question.

Why thank you for putting words in my mouth.

At no point have I said the worlds fair, the world isn't fair, hence why I've had to put in effort where others haven't.

What I'm saying is in context to the first post I replied to, which implied that if you're poor you'll stay poor, which is just an outright lie, things are harder yes, but with dedication and effort (and in some cases a bit of luck) you can get to a respectable level, you may not earn millions but you are by no means stuck where you started.

&gt;I'm really struggling to understand your second paragraph. I was explaining to you very succinctly that your singular experience does not prove the proposition that 'effort = reward.' Telling you this is not a scientific theory...

Since technically speaking, all scientific facts are also theories, then by stating your sentence as a scientific fact, you are also stating it as a scientific theory.

I may have come across as a bit arrogant and egocentric in these posts, so for that I apologise. But I'm sick to death of seeing people on Reddit bitch about how the systems so corrupt that your entire life is dictated at birth.

true,CannibalHolocaust,uk,London,"You've highlighted the more subtle impact of profiling - the tension it creates in society. Let's take the L.A. riots, the French riots and the English riots last year. All were triggered when minorities who were often targeted by police were either killed or beaten up. The L.A. riots were sparked by video footage of a black man, Rodney King getting beaten up by police being leaked. 

The French riots were sparked by the death of two innocent teenage boys (one Algerian and one black) after they were chased by police and ended up getting electrocuted. One of the survivors said they ran because minority teenagers are detained for hours regularly whenever there's a disturbance. This resulted in protests, eventually police stations being petrol bombed and then widespread rioting. The English riots were similar, a black gangster (apparently) shot dead but the suspicion surrounding the events resulted in rumours developing that the police had shot dead an innocent black man, this sparked rioting etc. 

These are significant social problems and can create a negative loop whereby if police deliberately target a group they will inevitably face a backlash as will the rest of society as punishment.

You think doctors will ""take the fall"" if one of them administers 10 times the amount of drug intended? There is no principle within English law or professional codes of conduct that excuses the but for test to nurses and lumps it on the concious of doctors. The only difference to members of the public which applies to both doctors and nurses is that the law will not punish an intent to do well against a calculable risk IE surgical and medical mistakes are judged on the basis that they were done badly but in the best interest rather than leaving the cellar door of a pub open on a busy high street.   In both cases professional bodies will instigate a hearing and then there will be a possibility of tort at the end. 

Go look on google. That the media only reports on when it happens to a doctor shows that we hold them in higher regard than we should. A nurse fucking up isn't a news story, someone from the middle classes being paid over the odds is. Hence those are the only cases you hear of. 

And that it forms the basis of compensation is erroneous. A teacher certainly isn't paid more because they are entrusted with 30 children for 5 hours a day otherwise college lecturers would, by your logic, earn 5 times less as a nursery teacher - they are paid simply due to status rather than need and effort.

When we mark a student or prepare them for an exam they are marked against banded criteria. There are five bands for GCSE and four for A-level. The bands do not equal grades. That's what we are told. 

So... when we mark a kids work and we put it in band 4 or 5 we expect a certain result based on previous years. The problem this year is that while we were told we were right, the marks boundaries moved. So a kid who was submitted with 25/40 last year got a C and this year got a D. Which means there is no parity of experience.

Exams are not getting easier. If anything this new GCSE is much tougher than the one I sat 16 years ago. It calls for a much broader range of skills and a much higher level of output to attain the grades. 

I have no problems with any of this. Times change so do exams. 

However, I do have a problem with this curve grading (that people have denied existed.)

Let me take you back to the Bands. For A-level, as I have said, there are four bands. One year, all of our students bar one ended up in the top band and the other was the top of the band below. (We were just hugely lucky to have incredibly talented students.) There are four bands. Just repeating.  Our marks were agreed so I am not inflating their ability. However, the student in the second top band got a D. And in the top band no one got an A, only Bs and Cs. The A went to the 39 and 40/40. That's it.

Again, I would be okay with this but the previous year students who achieved 21/40 received a C grade while that year only those achieve 32 received. 

We might not grade on a curve but UMS conversion can ruin lives. 

This is what he is trying to say. If you want to make exams harder - go for it. We will step up teaching but don't toy with lives.

Those of you saying a D grade isn't that bad have clearly not had to compete for Post 16 places. This isn't about uni, it's about students in a 11-16 school trying to stay on in education and not being able to.

Do his students ""deserve"" a C? I don't know. But I do know that the parity of experience they have had from exam boards is different. And I am not sure that should be how it is. ",0,1345850190,null,0,false,0,c5ybaq5,t3_yqu3s,t1_c5ybaq5,t3_yqu3s,null,1429728075,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

It is also so much an issue of perception. I've no doubt that there are abuses of stop and search, but the scale of the problem is also overstated by activists who oppose the power's use. For instance, when the Guardian says:

&gt; The Met police is 11 times more likely to stop and search black people than white ones, according to Equalities and Human Rights Commission research published earlier this year. 

It's being quite misleading. Firstly because [that research](http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/uploaded_files/ehrc_-_briefing_paper_no.5_-_s60_stop_and_search.pdf) only referred to stop and searches which occur under section 60, whereas the majority of stop and searches occur under different legislation, particularly PACE. Secondly because the majority of these stop and searches are going to be happening in relatively small areas. The police might see from the statistics that a particular part of Tottenham is a gun crime hotspot, and introduce heavy stop and search powers, so that they were stopping people entirely randomly. But if the areas where they introduce these measures are inhabited predominantly by black people (for whatever underlying social reasons, involving poverty, a history of racism, or even historic bad policing), when you scale up to London, or to the whole country, the statistics are going to look like they are massively racially biased. For instance, all Londoners are, by my calculations, 27 times more likely to be stopped by the police than people living in the rest of the UK*. Therefore, whichever racial groups are highly represented in London will come out looking profiled against when you scale up to national metrics.

1. You have to understand how transfers work. When a team signs a player for multi-millions, they don't just show up at the other club with a briefcase full of cash. Think of it more like buying a car.  **Transfer fees are [Amortized](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_\(business\))**, with payments being spread out over months and years. This gives the clubs the opportunity to structure contracts favorably as to keep to some sort of budget. 

2. FFP works on the basis that you can only spend what you make. **Winning the Champions League** last year left Chelsea with a pretty nice reward, but that is only the half of it.

3. Probably most important: Winning the Champions League. **Sponsorships**. What business wouldn't pay astronomical sums of money for their brand to be associated with a winner? Deals were struck this summer with Sauber F1, Delta Air Lines, and most importantly of all Gazprom.  While the first two did announce their sponsorship/payment as part of the deal, the amount of money Gazprom is putting into the club remains ""undisclosed.""

When he was a schoolboy he helped his school win a bunch of cups, check.  Broke into a Championship side and became a regular, check.  Broke into a Premiership side and became a regular, check.  

We got him at a time when he is good enough to be on our bench..  but it also happens to be a time when he could really use a new challenge to help with the rest of his development.  I think with the quality of players we have that he's going to be training and playing with, this guy's stats' could see a huge improvement over the next couple years.  I mean, c'mon, he's only 21, he's got many a year of improvement left in him.  It wouldn't be unwise to assume that his value is only going to go up.

When you're buying a player like that, a part of that £9m should really be thought of as payment for his potential, not only his present ability...   and I'm not saying that this guy is going to be amazing in 5 years, but he is definitely on an upwards parabola of improvement.  

Somebody else did all the hard work and handed us a player who is good enough to be playing for us yet is still improving and should continue to improve for several more years.  For £9m..  in this crazy market..  and we needed a player for that position..  and he's a homegrown player..

I'd never really pegged Suarez as someone who'd want to come out and talk in detail about tactics in the way Carra does, but there he is. It's just part of him wanting to do everything possible to help the team win.
