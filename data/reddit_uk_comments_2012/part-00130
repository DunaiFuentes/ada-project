true,JoshQuest1,tardis,TARDIS,"Well. Here's how I look at it. You know going into the series right now for the first time (unless you have a fantastic friend) that there are 3 doctors so far. So you'll be expecting two of the doctors to die. There are some things that if you want to go in blank, you literally have to *go in blank* and skip out on trailers, press releases, fansites, discussions, and subreddits. Otherwise, you've spoiled yourself already by knowing one tiny little thing.  
  
Personally, I kind of know the feeling, considering I was following the BBC Doctor Who twitter (and not just the BBCA) and right after the Asylum of the Daleks aired in the UK, they posted [AotD Spoiler](#s """"So how did you like the surprise appearance of JLC?"""") That was the best kept secret ever! And it would have been a nice shock had I not known about it before seeing it myself.  
But on the flipside of that. It would have meant nothing to me had I not known [Casting Change Spoiler](#s ""JLC was going to be the new companion."")  
So if you are worried about being spoiled at *all* to the point where you want to know *nothing*, please by all means, leave this subreddit until next Sunday. Or after Christmas if you don't want to know who the [Casting Change Spoiler](#s ""new companion"") is.

BBC America may be a separate legal entity, but the BBC that this judgment is talking about does operate in the U.S. It sends reporters there to do field work, it interviews Americans, it films on-location, it has agreements with American news agencies and other organisations.

Obviously as the judge can't direct federal marshals to seize the tapes on British soil, the BBC could quite legitimately tell America to fuck off, but then America could quite legitimately tell the BBC to fuck off the next time one of its reporters wants to cover an American story in person if the organisation it represents is refusing to comply with a court order than is legal within that jurisdiction.

I'll say it again; this is not the U.S. administration attempting to bully other countries, these are private citizens trying to get justice for barbaric attacks that caused injuries and deaths, and they're not asking for anything that wouldn't be lawful if this was an English case.

Other former IRA members voiced a fear of retribution if the tapes were released. The legal proceedings are ongoing.

Also, I really wouldn't care at all if companions left (or died) if I didn't have time to get attached to them.

1. Find High Quality Classic Who Episodes

2. Add fitting music by Murray Gold

3. Gain internet fame

One: The Military in general has much that lends itself to humor.The heightened levels of absurdity as well as the heightened awareness of mortality both provide ample material for any type of humor be it farce, satire, parody, tragedy or dark comedy.For that matter the hyper reality of the military has furnished movie and TV writers with material in all genres,not just comedy.
Two: The Soldiers are the first to recognize the absurdity and are often the most vocally supportive of any show that points it out for the rest of us. I have yet to see a comedy that makes fun of soldiers at the expense of soldiers.At its most base level there will be derogatory humor at the expense of either the enemy combatants or most likely the commanding officers.

I question though, how much should a US person ~~see your post as a ""well put"" source of information~~ (""take your post to heart"")?  
I am not trying to attack your viewpoint, I think its a valid one, but I just suggest to any readers that they should take caution upon reading it as ""class"" is not at all well-defined in the UK.

If you don't mind, (I have some questions):

# ` `

&gt; If your father was a plumber, you'll die a plumber's son. Class has less to do with money than you'd think.

* When is one's class defined?

* How far back in a family's tree can a person's class should / be defined? By one family generation or multiple?

# ` `

&gt; Dressing in a tracksuit, listening to rap and speaking like a Jamaican gangster won't make you any less middle class. Or less white. So you may as well accept your fate, go to a red brick university, get a good education, a nice job, add a kilo of weight per year and move to Islington and call your kids Daphne and Victor. And start ranting about stories in the daily mail.

As you mentioned about one's clothes, musical likings, a person's speech as well as however you defined ""white"" to be, could you clarify, using the logic you presented about these ""definitions""(?) (of a person)...

* ...how one's class should be taken into consideration to a person's ""fate""?

* What one person's actions can, indeed, define their own class?

* Whilst born and / or still being alive, can anyone (for example, an acquaintance, friend, or partner) affect a person's class? [\[*\]](/spoiler ""This question is supposed to be in the 'Prophetic perfect tense' or 'future indicative' in a form of a question. This is because the person I am replying to used the word 'fate' indicating that the sentence was now future-indicative or 'prophetic'."")  
A quick example of this in my mind would be [""the commoner""](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=commoner+kate+middleton ""...as she is so called..."") Kate Middleton being affected by her now partner, Prince William.  
Is this status-shift (via association) possible by anyone and what are all the possible ways to do so?

# ` `

* What about a person from another country entering and residing in the UK?  
How is their fate defined? Can it ever be defined or are they ""exempt"" somehow?

* Can a person be defined with the status, ""no-class""?  
Is this a good status to have or a bad one?

* If a person from the UK moved to another country, would their class status still be upon them?  
Who would define it on them?

* If a person from India, with their own ""class system"", comes to the UK, should their own class system be recognised?  
What is the difference in recognition-status between the UK class system and this possible Indian class system?

# ` `

* What is the difference between ""working-class"", ""middle-class"" or ""upper-class"" if they are all indeed [""working""](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=working#hl=en&amp;q=working&amp;tbs=dfn:1 ""Definition: 1"")?

**John Lovesey - Sports editor of The Sunday Times who developed a distinctive investigative approach and supported a number of memorable campaigns**

Times, The (London, England) - Monday, September 24, 2012

As sports editor of The Sunday Times for 12 years, John Lovesey had no small role in the innovation of the newspaper under Harold Evans.

Encouraged to produce pages that delved beyond factual reports, he introduced photo essays, graphics and illustrations, gleaned, in part, from Sports Illustrated, the US publication where he learnt his craft.

Lovesey was a fan of sports journalism rather than of particular clubs or even some of the various events he covered, although he was interested in more sports than sometimes is the case with editors nowadays. His first by-line was on the Henley Regatta and he was not wedded to a football team. Athletics, swimming and sailing were special enthusiasms and he was to promote fitness through The Sunday Times ""Fun Run"", a precursor to the London Marathon.

He was also ahead of his time in the 1970s and early 1980s in addressing drug-taking in sport, in promoting disabled sport and giving female journalists prominence on sports pages when they were not always welcomed in football press boxes or by football managers. Although not well during this summer, his television was constantly on at his nursing home during the Olympics and Paralympics. It was fitting that he should live to see the success of the latter event.

Lovesey filled a number of other roles at the Sunday Times, chiefly in a management capacity, and had a further two years as sports editor in the mid-1980s, but was uncomfortable working at Wapping during News International's dispute with print workers and did not enjoy the same relationship with Andrew Neil, the then editor, as he had done with Evans. Always romantic about sport, he regarded the 14 years he spent working with Evans as the best of his life.

John William Lovesey , the son of an engineer, left Hampton Grammar School in west London when he was 15, becoming an office boy earning £2 a week at Time-Life magazine in Mayfair.

His family did not have sufficient money to consider sending him to university.

After his National Service in the RAF, serving as an air traffic controller — he enjoyed drill in particular — he returned to the company, now cross-referencing stories in its library and appreciating the emphasis placed on images.

Given the chance of an assignment in 1955, Lovesey reported on the Open; he was especially thrilled to be allowed to buy an umbrella on expenses. His first by-line, at Henley, followed two years afterwards, and from then until 1967 he covered numerous events for Time-Life and its sister publication, Sports Illustrated.

Evans, who became editor of The Sunday Times in 1967, was not a noted follower of sport, but was keen to nurture less formulaic coverage than was prevalent in national newspapers and had appreciated the American approach of these two magazines.

Lovesey worked initially for three years as the paper's sports features editor as well as a writer, before becoming sports editor in 1970. He employed two exceptional photographers, Gerry Cranham, who became a close friend, and Chris Smith, and encouraged talented writers ranging from Michael Parkinson to Brian Glanville to Robin Marlar. He formed the ""Inside Track"" column, mirroring the investigations for which the paper was becoming renowned.

Lovesey developed the idea that it was more interesting to write about jogging than football. And he got away with it. While other papers dismissed football hooligans with a few stereotypical phrases, Lovesey thought laterally: he asked Saatchi &amp; Saatchi to outline how they would pitch a ""Love Football"" campaign.

Another intriguing series involved a search for the country's most outstanding amateur sports player. The finalists were presented like footballers on old cigarette cards; the winner was a hockey international with 88 caps who had also won the junior doubles at Wimbledon, and who was a hurdler who had run 400m in 59 seconds.

He was the first newspaper executive, let alone sports editor, to take Peter Hain's anti-apartheid campaign seriously and wrote memorably about the troubles at the 1968 and 1972 Olympics.

The idea for improved fitness came when Lovesey was told by one of his sons that his upper body shape was unbecoming and he should wear a bra. This was no more than a throwaway remark and yet it presaged a pursuit of aerobic exercise that led to a campaign called ""Middle age Fitness: Time for Action."" The Sunday Times ""Fun Run"" attracted 30,000 participants and lasted for 15 years.

After Evans left the Sunday Times, Lovesey took on a number of other roles within the paper, all for short periods.

His organisational skills and the success he had made of the sports department led to an appointment as managing editor of news in 1982, overseeing coverage of the Falklands conflict; editor of the Innovation section; chief systems editor; deputy features editor and, from 1986 to 1988, he filled in as sports editor once more. This proved to be not so enjoyable as before. He subsequently worked for Racing Post as assistant editor and for The Observer. A man who smiled a lot and who rarely raised his voice, he would, nonetheless, ask his correspondents to rewrite from time to time and would take out any displeasure on his office telephone — which had to be replaced frequently.

He could not abide conceit in others.

""On my instructions,"" he told Brough Scott, the jockey turned racing journalist, ""the chief sub-editor has taken seven examples of the first person singular out of your column. As you know, I believe it gets between the story and the reader."" Scott was not cowed; he found Lovesey inspirational.

Lovesey wrote two books on sport, one on swimming, and edited others. In retirement, he studied Humanities at the Open University, taking a 2.1 degree and hence proving to himself that he could with alacrity have furthered his formal education when young.

He is succeeded by his wife, Christine, whom he met during his National Service, two sons and two daughters.

John Lovesey , sports editor and writer, was born on February 5, 1933. He died on September 21, 2012, aged 79

Sunday Times, The (London, England) - Sunday, September 23, 2012
Author: Nick Pitt

IT WAS fitting that the life of John Lovesey , the former Sunday Times sports editor who died on Thursday aged 79, extended through the great summer festival of sport that was London 2012, for many of the causes and themes he championed in these pages, in the 1970s and beyond, reached fulfilment at the Olympics and Paralympics.

Lovesey always insisted there was more to sports coverage than reports on football, cricket and rugby; he gave valuable space in the newspaper to women's sport and disabled sport; he had a vision that the appreciation of great performers could encourage wider athletic participation; and he had a belief that sport, by bringing people together, could promote the best aspects of humanity.

After national service in the RAF, Lovesey worked in the library of the Time-Life office in London. His talents were soon noticed and he became a writer and London editor for Sports Illustrated, Time-Life's weekly sporting magazine.

In 1964 Lovesey and the photographer Gerry Cranham were dispatched to Ghana, where Muhammad Ali, who had won the world heavyweight title and converted to Islam, was tracing his African roots. During the assignment, Lovesey and Cranham struck up a friendship with Ali, who later, when he was in London, invited them to tea.

Although he worked for The Sunday Times from 1967 to 1988 in various senior capacities, Lovesey 's years as sports editor, from 1970 to 1982, were the core of his life's work. When the editor Harold Evans brought Lovesey to the paper, he encouraged him to deviate radically from traditional British sports journalism. Lovesey brought rigorous American standards from Sports Illustrated and a mission to inform readers not merely who had won, but how and why.

He also developed the use of explanatory illustrations and graphics, and of photo-essays that employed the talents of Cranham and Chris Smith. All this was done within the confines of four sports pages every Sunday.

Lovesey assembled an eccentric group of writers. ""We had to lead,"" one of them said last week. ""We had to be different."" And no longer, thanks to Lovesey , was sport regarded as the paper's toy department.

Lovesey was patient, modest and generous. He tried to attract female readers to the sports pages, employed three women as sportswriters and inaugurated the Sunday Times Sportswoman of the Year award. He started an investigative column, Inside Track; he promoted fitness through The Sunday Times Fun Run, which prepared the way for the London Marathon.

Forty years ago Lovesey was using journalism to lead the way in celebrating sporting excellence; to warn about drug cheats; to suggest sport could help us all to be healthier and happier.

Sociologists agree that there is no real definite way to define class, and I think that basing it purely on job position is unrealistic, because it assumes everyone in those sorts of levels has the same social traits. 

Despite identifying as a real leftie socialist, I am still quite wary of the immediate and popularist idea of taxing a percentage of people.

My dad was, and is, a welder. I'm an engineer. Arguably a middle class job (proffesional, very decent wage, not getting my hands dirty etc.). However, that doesnt make me any less working class. Thats how I was brought up and even if I live in a nice house with a nice car it doesnt change who I am. 

But my kids, if and when I have them, will be brought up with that lifestyle. Therefore, they would, unfortunately maybe, be much more middle class.

You can better yourself and achieve anything you want in life no matter where you come from but I believe its exceptionally rare for somebody to actually change ""class"". Not that thats a bad thing. I'm proud to be working class. There's certainly no stigma attached to it.

What we could do with is the banks becoming exceptionally good at spotting a good business investment and lending to those whilst holding back on the others.  But this is really quite difficult.

While the banks ""repair their balance sheet"" (i.e. hold back cash that they should have been doing for years), someone else is needed to step in and lend to small businesses.

We continue to sign up to Private Finance Initiatives, which sees some councils close down public buildings (libraries, sport centers, swimming pools etc) just to pay for the privately-built public buildings they decided they needed, and wanted to pay off over 30 years.

We attack the disabled and force them back to work, despite the fact disability benefit accounts for around 1% of what the government does with taxes. On top of that, we pay a monsterous company like ATOS £200m, to do such a bad job of things, we also pay out a growing £50m a year in payouts, and an estimated 30 people died a month between January and July this year who were deemed ""fit to work"".

A while ago, some dopey MP thought it would be a good idea to sell off our forests - even though they are the only government department that actually makes a profit (selling lumber rights).

We squander £1billion on a ""small business fund"" designed to allow small businesses to get loans - even though this is what the banks are meant to be doing. Why we don't pressure them, oh wait, I know, MPs are spineless and won't want to risk their Non-Executive status on large private companies.

Our much delayed Eurofighter both under-performs compared to F-16 jets, and costs twice as much as an F-18.

Our Overseas Aid Development department squandered millions on making themselves richer, whilst ignoring the 3rd world folk the money was actually meant to be spent on.

We have middle management up the wazoo absorbing any money that's meant to trickle down. And whenever something needs to be done, all an MP does is ""Start a commission/new department/inquest/investigation"" which only ever seems to hire more already well-off people, and never do anything about the original problem.

The man at the head of HM Customs and Revenue made personal deals with Vodafone and Goldman Sachs that let them off over £26billion they owed in tax (this wasn't contested). To put that into perspective that amount would pay the £9k for nearly 1 million students, for 3 years of university.

Everybody knows how to get the money, but nobody is willing to challenge the banks or the party sponsors that got them into power in the first place.

true,laerad,null,null,"Class is pretty much a definition of a part of your cultural heritage; i.e., the way you talk, the approximate set of ideals you hold, your attitude, what sports you enjoy, etc.

More than anything, though, it's the way you talk: Talk rough? Working class. Talk posh? Upper class. Talk ""proper""? Middle class. 

Play polo? Upper class.

Edit: To answer some of your more serious points, the class system does not necessarily map directly onto visitors to the country. Immigrants are likely to be labeled upper class if they support themselves without *overtly* having to work to do so, and either have holdings abroad or expensive holdings in this country; middle class if they live in a moderately affluent neighbourhood and work to support their family; and lower class if they live in a poor neighbourhood and work in a lower paid job to support their family. In this instance class is less about heritage than about the heritage that is likely to be bestowed upon the next generation. In all instances it's about the social heritage and opportunities bestowed upon the generations. 

**However** it's worth noting that people are not generally called lower or upper class unless they fit strongly into at least one of the defining categories (upper: wealth, air of superiority, posh, public school, certain sporting childhoods; working: largely a particularly category of accents, mannerisms and trades).

I'd say there's a pretty fair distribution of idiots around the country and there is no particular concentrations.  There are a lot of deprived areas in Liverpool  due to the economic climate and the decline in industry in Liverpool and it's true some of the worst areas in the country are situated up north and some of them are in Liverpool.  A lot of older people lost their jobs when the docks collapsed and we've not quite recovered from that and it seems to be getting worse.

I am a developer and I'm doing fairly well up here because there is a need for me, I wouldn't call myself or anyone I associate with as thick as pig shit (I'm a developer, it requires at least some logic skills), but of course, there is a big proportion of Liverpool who do bounce around Liverpool in a tracksuit drinking Stella.  I do plan on moving down south however, the opportunities here are small scale business and the big bucks are in global banks and hedge funds

&gt;You gave us the Beatles for christs sake, now everyone up there's thick as pigshit...

You wouldn't believe how many Liverpudlians despise being associated to this band or either of the football teams (Sorry Tranmere).

I know well that it isn't that much money. As I say, earning in the £50s I wasn't exactly out buying champagne and fois gras every night. But, despite being thousands in debt, and not owning my own home, I still had the freedom to live comfortably. To go on holiday each year. To have a decent standard of living. 

The notion that my being taxed more is some kind of outrage is laughable. Of course I'd rather keep more of my money, we all would, but if you are earning in the £50s you are one of the lucky ones. I worked my way to where I am too, but let's be honest, birth and good luck has a fair bit to do with it too. Problem is when tax comes up, everyone thinks it's the people who are above them who should pay more. Us in the £50ks think it should be those lucky buggers in the £100k bracket. The £100k bracket demand that you're only really rich if you're making £250k or more. And so on till you get to the people who don't give a shit as they have the tax experts to help them move it all offshore and they pay piss all.

But none of that changes the fact that, while it may not be a fortune, if you're in the £50k mark you're in the top 10%. And yes, we could afford to pay more. It's a least an acceptable topic for politicians to discuss.

true,GimmeSomeSugar,null,null,"To explain my thinking a little further:  
Acknowledging that attraction to children is a sexual preference seems conducive to compelling such a person to seek help to effectively self-regulate, mitigating the risk they pose.  
For example, someone who feels like they have a sex drive for which they realistically have no release is going to seek help and comfort from somewhere, lest they go insane. If we're demonising attraction to children then will that help be sought in secret dark corners from like minded individuals? That's a scary thought.  
On the other hand, if it's generally understood that one could visit a mental health professional and they will offer judgment free counselling and teach to effectively self-regulate, as opposed to offering chemical castration or immediately passing a patient's details to the police. Isn't that going to be a more effective way of achieving the ultimate goal of removing the risk to children?   
&gt;If you are attracted to children and you suppress it and never take action on it that's fine but if you think you run the risk of hurting a child (mentally or physcially) you need to seek help  
  
I think we may be generally thinking along the same lines. What I'm saying is should we be doing more to encourage these people to seek help, as opposed to having them think ""If I own up to this my life is over"".

This is an anonymous (well, sort of) internet site and the level of insight should be taken as such - sort of a slightly better authority than, say Jeremy Clarkson, or wikipedia. I do appreciate your feedback and will attempt to answer some, if not all.

2 defining points can be taken as read, as I believe them and attempted to communicate.

1. Money in the US defines class almost exclusively; it does not (as much) in the UK.
2. The class system is alive and well. 

On to the points and questions.

 - Class is defined, I believe, when one has consciousness of it. Whether that is when you realise your school is special because everyone gets dropped off in Bentleys or you get to university and find a bunch of spoiled middle classed wankers instead of people that, like you perhaps, actually had to work hard to get there - despite feeling quite privileged and 'possibly middle class' before. The point about my answer is you actually define your own class by the circumstances you relate to around you. This isn't a fact, just a belief - interested to know how other people came to be defined.

 - How far back? See above - you define yourself.

 - Fate? I am sorry I don't really understand the question.

 - Actions - well that goes back to my point about moving to islington etc. If you look at characters like Andy Warhol or john geilgood and Quentin Crisp with their affectations they are classless - perhaps you can see what they are aiming for but their actions define them, from their personal interactions to their profession - they just are. You cannot imagine them entertaining falseness for the sake of popularity or an attempt to 'move'. I am rambling but this is the crux of what I mean throughout this - class defines you (as you define yourself) and it's a rare man or woman that can outgrow it. I think that's what I mean.

 - See above and please provide more examples of people that may have pulled it off - I think Kate is liked because she so clearly is NOT of the same class. And no I don't think it ever goes away for the people that care about it - google Alan Clarkes comments about Michael Hesaltine's 'furniture' to see schoolyard snobbery in place at the heart of British politics.

 - 'Them over 'ere - I have no idea about this beyond I think a class system operates everywhere and people slot into it fairly easily or not. Coming to America is a good study of this, as is the fact intermarriage throughout the classes has taken place for centuries. Hence the fact the British Royal family is, as blackadder reminds us of Queen Victoria when Darling says he's as british as she ""So your father's German, you're half German, and you married a German""!

 'Us over there - Again I think it is relative to that market. Barrow boy traders earning millions a year seem to be pretty well treated in New York but I am sure the Old Money detests the New Money. I don't know really.

Difference if they are all working? I suppose the biggest marker is they know and we all know. How we came to that point is a thousand years of cultural growth and will take a smarter man than me to answer.

In many areas of Ceredigion outside of Aberystwyth, speaking Welsh would make your life a hell of a lot easier, as you have access to everything that goes on in your community, not just the stuff in English. I don't think many people understand this when moving to places in Wales where Welsh speakers are in the majority. Language is about communication, understanding, and through language culture is carried. Goof on you for giving it a go.

It's a subreddit for people who get off on surreptitious photos of others, it's obviously preying on others. That needs no debate on banning people from taking photos in public places. It's not a sign of maturity to debate what's right or wrong about any possible incidence of it, it's a sign of having too much time on your hands and not enough experience of living in a community.

This is such a minor thing that I'm not going to spend time debating unnecessary minutiae. You don't need to invent laws banning things; as has always been the case, if someone offends others in this way, they'll be censured. Don't bother to write about changing times and challenging established norms, etc. It's obvious - don't prey on others for your kicks. Don't post me equivalences, just accept that in this case, I feel no need to debate every last possible incident, oh but this person might be doing something innocently that people think is guilty.

No; it's obvious, and I'm not going to bother with your drawn-out agonising over it. You're not more broad-minded as a result, you're just arguing the toss and trying to gain the intellectual high ground in the bargain, to make your over-questioning seem better than just naivity. I think it's more mature to let obvious things like this go and focus on important questions that really need tackling.

Such rules would only be important if you are a creep who behaves in this way. In which case, why do you think it's going to be made easier for you to offend the vast majority by giving you a set of rules to hide behind?

I agree for most subjects.  I think it's really difficult or impossible to correctly assess *understanding* of a subject with coursework.

When I did GCSEs they didn't assess understanding at all.  You could memorise the book the night before and get As.  I did that for science, in fact I got A*s without any revision whatsoever and barely trying in class.

I was much more happy with A-levels because they tested your understanding.  There was simply no way to pass the exam by just memorising stuff.

Andrew Marr has also noted it in one of his histories of britain, and that popular documentary he did on the Queen a few months ago, and he's watched by lots of people.

As for this article, I think the surprise actually is about the subject matter, not the Queen stating an opinion, which although we never hear of, we know must be stated (what else is going to happen? A minister goes there, talks about the issues and she sits there in silence with a blank expression, just in case a politician is stupid enough to base a decision off her?).

It could be nothing, it could be an homage, it could be a toy Atraxi children play with and pretend to be human, we can never *know* why it's there, so of course any discussion of it would be opinion. I wasn't trying to suggest otherwise, but I see how it came off that I was.

No one ever talks about the holes in Brad's game and the improvements we could see from a keeper of Hug's stature.

true,soundknowledge,,CO4,"Hey, I've just finished a 4 year course in Colchester. Here's a non-exhaustive list of venues for you:

**[Sub Zero / Level 2 / Frangos:](http://www.essexstudent.com/freshers/nights/)** These are your on-campus venues. I worked here, and still do on occasion. The freshers week lineup is pretty damn good this year, If you do one thing, **GO AND SEE TONY LEE ON SUNDAY 7th OCTOBER!** He is insane. Sub Zero has big club nights, level 2 smaller ones in a bar setting, and Frangos is an occasional venue / Nando's-style venue. If you do come down during Freshers or for Tony Lee, PM me and i'll try and find you and say Hi!

**[Colchester Arts Centre:](http://www.colchesterartscentre.com/)**
This place has a good variety of events, A quick glance at the lineup gives you stuff from The Colchester Symphony Orchestra to Napalm Death to Stephen K Amos. Big venue, set in an old church. You get a lot of mid-sized touring circuit bands here.

**[The Twist:](http://www.xxxpromotions.co.uk/)** Smaller Venue, Has been closed for a while but I think it's now reopened. Local bands and small-scale touring bands here. Always seemed to be the place for ska / punk / metal.

**[The Bull:](http://www.thebullcolchester.co.uk/whats-on/)**
Pub in town, with a music venue in the back garden. Lot of smaller / local acts here, I've seen some bloody good stuff in there.

**[V Bar:](http://v-bar.com)** A bit of a ""Marmite"" bar, with occasional gigs upstairs. Seems to be the hangout for the Indie / Rock / Scene crowd. I never really liked it, but you may love it tbh.


All the venues I mentioned (other than the on-campus ones) are in the Town Centre, get a 61 or 62 bus into town. Taxi back to campus is about 6 to 8 quid at the end of the night. Enjoy yourself, there's always  more venues, and there's a Liquid as well if you feel like drinking watered down, overpriced crap while watching 17 year old sluts grind themselves into early pregnancy...

It's a credit to our chairman that we've still been able to bring in players like Vertonghen and Dembele who surely could have played for CL teams. 

Levy has also proven in recent years that he's not adverse to making big bids for players. The wages are not actually as big of an issue with Hazard as people are making it out to be. He's probably on 100k, but if Chelsea hadn't been in the CL he would have surely taken less to play with us.

true,falsestone,null,null,"I guess in a short seas, I could see certain viewers feeling gypped by writers using one main story for two episodes, and generating less-than-ideal reviews. However, they really should've weighed that risk against that rushed mess that was the second half of Po3. A rewrite or trimming of details was needed, which would have been done be the writers. While I don't fault Chibnall's excellent initiative and creativity, he NEEDS to write for the time-slot he's given. But, since the producers and coordinators dictate what gets filmed and what gets shown, a blanket ""bad job"" all around to those in charge of Season 7 thus far, with emphasis on episodes 2 and 4.

There's a certain standard of timing, excitement, character development, and innovation expected in Who. You mess up one, and fans are a little disappointed, but it's okay because the error becomes something to talk about. You mess up two or three or (forbid!) all four, and you've got a train wreck of an episode on your hands. EVERYONE, especially writers, but including those who clear them for filming and screening, need to pay attention to these.

FOLLOWING ANALYSIS CONTAINS MANY SPOILERS:

Episode 1 had a slip with innovation at the end, but that final line could be seen as tying the two seasons and so was permissible. Overall, great episode.

2 messed up character development and timing, and both botched one innovation (Mitchell and Webb) and introduced another, better one (Silurian Noah's Space-Ark). So, not great by any means but perhaps ok.

3 had poor timing, but not painfully so. The slower 'Western' pace also went with the theme of the episode, making the unusual-for-who timing ok. The rest of the standards were great, so it was a good episode.

4 had a lot of good character development at the beginning, but sort of...stopped. Also, great innovations, but too many at once, plus mention of Torchwood, plus UNIT, plus the Brigadier's daughter--they had too much going on at once. Add to it the slow beginning (on purpose and well done with the Doctor's impatience, but not great for the amount of time the focus on slowness took up) tacked onto the ultra-rushed end, and you have bad timing on your hands. At the end, just as things get exciting, the Sonic Screwdriver deus-ex-machinas us out of a decent ending. Tacking on, just because it annoys me, the bad research that went into this episode as far as heart attacks, AEDs, and heart attack recovery (everyone still would have died, or died later with likely cardiac necrosis. Amy shocking the Doctor's non-working heart would've done nothing for him while shocking the working on would've stopped it, so she'd have killed the Doctor).

So, episodes went: ""Great"", ""Ok"", ""Good"", ""What in blue boxes happened here?"" (and that last one is not in a good way).",0,1348585910,null,0,false,0,c6d7jhn,t3_10f3r5,t1_c6d7jhn,t1_c6d77n8,null,1429987478,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,noiserr,null,null,"&gt; Dzeko scores goals more by luck than judgement

Tell that to Bundesliga players, who consistently voted him as the best striker in the league. The most underrated Dzeko's ability is his sharpness, he is incredibly dangerous because of his ability to make the right call when it comes to hitting or passing the ball in a split second. His technical ability lies in being able to provide aerial threat and the ability to finish with either foot.

This ability and the unselfishness made him and Grafite the best striking duo of all time in Bundesliga. What's even more telling is that they did it with Wolfsburg, which up until that point was an unremarkable team.

Now I have watched Dzeko make some mistakes last season, but most of that comes from, not being able to establish partnerships in the team because frankly, he's benched so often, and every time he's subbed in he plays with a different team, this and rust from not receiving enough game time. 

Watch the game from two weeks ago against Stoke. There are at least 3 times in the match, where Dzeko is in a perfect scoring position, but he gets no service, he would have scored each one of those times. I also think if Mancini kept Dzeko in the last game against Arsenal we wouldn't have conceded that goal out of the corner, because Dzeko offers a lot of support in terms of corner defense with his 6""4 height.

Despite all this Dzeko was the 2nd highest scorer in the team last season, and Aguero scored far more goals paired with Dzeko than he did with Balotelli. He also scored the important equalizer against QPR after being in the game for only 5 minutes, which also was no luck, but a sign of a great striker.",0,1348586344,null,0,1348586878,0,c6d7nmk,t3_104x6r,t1_c6d7nmk,t1_c6as158,null,1429987527,3,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,3

true,kenny-rogers,null,null,"I agree it really is hard to quantify because a ten pound note doesn't have a geo-tag and it can't be watched as it changes hands. The statistics I am using is nothing but empiricism and obvious truths. London has many examples of institutions with a strong gravitational wealth effect: MET, CPS, monarchy, parliament buildings, richest bankers, stock exchange, Heathrow, BBC, the universities, etc. I'd include Oxbridge as a satellite London borough maybe, and of course the Olympics, Wembley, football teams, that sort of thing. Others would include people like the Gaddafis, rich Russians and Greeks all parking their wealth in London property. This leads to another problem where the very rich are geographically and socially close to politics so their interests are just always going to be heard first and loudest.

Most money ""earned"" in London probably isn't, it just ends up there. Where do your insurance payments go? Mortgages? Student loans? A crude example half-truth half-hypothetical of 40m£ stolen for the queen who then spends it mostly in and around London, is 2 billion£ over 50 years not being distributed elsewhere. Where does Tesco suck it's profits to? The fees for your over draft?  Things like housing benefit will have disproportionate weighting and be recirculated in the London economy. On top of all that there are Cayman Islands, Jerseys and the City of London which are largely black holes. Another macro effect is private investment wanting to go where the money is.

There are so many ways regional and local economies can leak wealth, the largest is taxation, then probably financial services. If the wealth isn't returned in equal amounts then over a long enough time frame poverty or collapse is a mathematical certainty. We even see that effect between nation states in places like Haiti. Perhaps ""national income"" was the wrong construct, and wealth would have been better, because that would include everything from infrastructure, tax, ""private"" spending, ""public"" spending, and the harvesting of the UKs brightest minds. I think that last point is a really serious issue similar to how a Tesco works. Even if only 1% of the local pound or brightest children in a given area is attracted elsewhere, the compound effect over time will create a concentration of the least capable and the least well off - money just won't be circulating.",0,1348586870,null,0,false,0,c6d7smt,t3_10fvf5,t1_c6d7smt,t1_c6d65va,null,1429987649,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

If you are reliant on ad hoc rented vehicles you might be a little bit rusty especially in an unfamiliar vehicle - obviously that is hypothetical and I have no data for that. When you drive a car you literally are contributing to immense stresses on the NHS and welfare system - but that is never thought about. It's accepted colateral damage.

The opportunity cost is actually quite severe in some cases. Even if car is cheaper, you can't work and drive (unless you are a courier of course) so being productive on the train can offset the ticket price, an option not available in the car. Again this is my wider point, people aren't thinking inclusively enough.

The overall point I am making is that the car when seen at a societal level isn't cheap, convenient, efficient, or safe. In some cases it's not even fast - bikes beat urban traffic in most areas. Thinking selfishly at the immediate costs one might judge it as being more economical, but collectively it isn't or at least shouldn't be. With all the money, resources, policing, loss of life, and climate change required to allow the individual to think they are living the dream having freedom of the road, there has to be a better way. I don't believe the current train costs are anywhere near a fair or natural price, mainly because flying in some cases is cheaper as well as the car which is so *ridiculous* it's just not credible, it makes no sense.

&gt; This isn't a shock, this won't change. It does however contribute the most taxation of any region and is the highest GVA per capita.

And how likely is it that London is the chief tax avoider?

&gt; This money benefits the country as a whole.

You assume it does but it is hard to know for certain. If it did why is the north/south divide such a big problem that isn't going away? There's nothing natural about it. [85% of people in London don't actually do anything](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_London). The financial sector dominates: many just move money around to make money.

&gt; Tesco, for example, open stores all over the country as a result of that profit and pay staff in their local communities.

It's laughable that you try and claim Tescos to be a net positive local gain. It takes money, and leaves dumbed down low skilled underpaid jobs with little to no prospects in the best of scenarios. In the worst in shuts down the local grocers and book shop who then probably have to go work for them at lower wages, or at least some one in the community does, whilst increases car traffic which increases road kill and air pollution. Like I hinted at if Tescos sets up shop and takes just 1% a year from the total money in circulation, if there is no counter balance eventually things go bad for the local economy. Corporations profit by taking more than they leave behind, so I think it is say to say that Tesco isn't going to be that balance.

A maths question for you: I have 1000£ that I want to spend in the local economy, and it just so happens that anyone I give it to will always spend it locally as well.

Prime example was how Fabregas went for so relatively cheap to Barcelona. Cesc wouldn't sign a contract with anyone else, and so Arsenal's hands were tied. When only one person in the whole world can make a purchase, there is no competition for the product, and so the price will fall drastically.

To me, it's either one of the two forward midfield positions. Probably the central most position the best, as his energy allows him to cover a lot of area.

I like Jonjo playing the most advanced position, as he likes to drive forward and is pretty creative. That would leave Jordan competing with Stevie for the most central role, although you could argue Stevie should be starting in the most advanced position instead of Jonjo. And we know there's no way Stevie isn't playing. We're also trying to incorporate Sahin into the midfield. I see him as playing the most advanced midfield position once he gets his fitness up.

Speed is a decent measure of the technology available at the Exchange and what sort of POPs are nearby. It's a rising tide sort of thing, the general level needs to be at a certain mark in order for some things to be done. Granted lots of these things won't be used by everyone but it helps with specific use cases in an area and with general economic development.

Add to that, that faster speed connections have a lower per unit cost so cheaper broadband with less likelihood of a usage policy, and the latency and rich media nature of websites has been mentioned already. It'll be cheaper in the long run to upgrade to the latest instead of playing catchup in some areas. Also some technologies such as IPv6 are problematic at best on the older BT infrastructure.

You can even make the argument that faster broadband is actually of more use in rural and less densely populated areas.

In my view it just detracts from the job of governance; Government (which like it or not comes from the queen's right to rule) is accountable to parliament. It's parliament's job to make sure that the executive is doing their job properly (at least in theory). The House of Commons is then accountable to voters (at least in theory). In any case the media are very good at holding people to account; a lot better than the public. Look at each of the three major scandals of the past couple of years and ask how many of those were uncovered by the media. Parliamentary Expenses and Phone Hacking were not uncovered by the public, how could they have been?

The media also is not unaccountable though; it is accountable in the first instance to their consumers; if the consumer doesn't like the editorial line of a media company then they will either move to a different company or fall out of the market. In the second instance the media is accountable to the regulator (at least in theory). In the third instance, the media is accountable to their shareholders/the board of directors. And in the final instance the Media is accountable to the law either through parliamentary enquiry or the courts. The same sort of thing is true for every company that works in this country! 

How would the public knowing about it do anything other than impede the process through ignorant people who listen to half truths and make narrow conclusions?

You say we can do x and y to sort out what you claim is a problem, but how much do you actually know about how efficient the system is as it stands? How would full public disclosure make a difference in actuality? What would change? What would we gain?

It's not depressing IMO, there's going to be struggle transitioning but in the long run it's for the best I think.

But I'm a misty eyed futurist and look forward to post-job society, if I live that long.  

We shouldn't be aiming for employment for employments sake.  Everything that can be automated should be.  

If we get to the stage where we have ""unlimited"" clean energy, our food technology improves and we reach a stage where so much is automated (*I'm looking forward to most vehicles on the road being automated!*), there's no reason our base level couldn't be people with shelter, food and the time to do as they please (be that nothing or trying to become an astronaut etc) safe in the knowledge that when they're too old to look after themselves, we have a system in place to look after them . . . . . hopefully robots will do that.

I think what I'm looking forward too is a ""Post-scarcity economy""

true,concertina,tardis,TARDIS,"There's certainly some funny business going on with the ties.

Bear with me here, I took a close look at the season 7 episodes.  From the Williams' most likely timeline, we see the doctor with:

* Blue (Pond Life 1,2,4,5)
* Blue (AotD)
* Red (DoaS)
* Blue (beginning of tPoT)
* Blue (at the beginning of the party in tPoT)
* Blue (before AND after the Savoy in tPoT)
* Red (under Henry VIII's bed)
* Blue (ATCM)
* Red (the rest of tPoT)
* [Angels, based on trailer](#s ""Red"")

Please correct me if I'm wrong! There's a lot of footage involved.

Notice there's quite a lot of jumping around here, in particular with the events surrounding the party. So we're either getting a very out-of-order experience, or the tie is just a coincidence.

If all the red-bowtie doctor events happened first, he'd already know the purpose of the cubes in the middle of tPoT.  Which is possible, but a bit odd that he'd keep mum about it, especially given that so many lives were at risk. He'd also be dropping them off from the party before picking them up, which makes it hard to explain how he started traveling with them for that bit.

Still, if this did happen, from the doctor's POV we'd have to have something like:

[a timeline of:](#s ""Angels - DoaS - Henry VIII - middle/end tPoT - TIE SWITCH - Pond Life - AotD - beginning of tPoT - appear at party tPoT - Savoy - ATCM"")

or

[a timeline of:](#s ""Angels - DoaS - Henry VIII - middle/end tPoT - TIE SWITCH -  beginning of tPoT - appear at party tPoT - Savoy - ATCM - Pond Life - AotD"")

depending on whether the events in Pond Life / AotD happen before or after tPoT.  Either way, it seems a little forced.

So yeah, it's theoretically possible, but it seems like Moffat is trying to keep us guessing about the timeline by giving throwback references to the teselecta tie-switch.

Also I agree on the Henderson issue

Henderson will become a fantastic player. I have no doubt in my mind about this. I think the reason he is not currently fantastic and has not been fantastic the last year is because unlike Sterling and Suso he is 22 and will maybe become 23 years old before he gets trusted to be a vital part of the team under BR.

At the age of 15-20 most guys are the ""champions of the world"", teenagers, a ""genius"" and therefore also filled with confidence. When you actually are remarkably good at what you do best then that confidence might even be higher than for normal teenage boys.

At this point in their career Sterling and Suso have that confidence and will take on ANYONE without hesitating and that is also why they actually are successful at taking defenders on. Henderson was just like those two when he was younger. A flair player, quick, slick dribbles and good crosses, but that trait of a player was not nurtured in Henderson by a big name club as Liverpool.

Henderson is not 17-18 anymore and hence he does not have the same ""drive"" as a 18 year old. Those 4 year does a lot to you as a person, an athlete and a footballer. Those 4 years gives you higher top speed when running, stronger physique(heavier) and a better understanding of the bigger picture in the game, but the cost is that acceleration often declines a little. Since he was not with a big name club at this stage in his career his mind was not nurtured in the same way as Sterling's or Suso's is, either. 
He was the best player of the club he played for. Sterling and Suso is not(on paper). They(Sterling and Suso) have learned ""every day"" at from players like Suarez, Gerrard, Kuyt, Maxi. They have even been able to learn from players like Torres. Just take a moment and think about what that does to you as a 15-16 year old teenager who likes to kick a ball around the pitch.

Henderson did not have this in the same way. His talent from 18 and onwards is what brought him to Liverpool. He did not have those profiles teaching him in Sun'land or Coventry. And he has just had 1 year to learn from ""our"" guys. Think about what a player Henderson might have been if he came in 4 -5 years ago at the age of 17-18. JEBUS!

At this point in his career, if he focuses on the right things, I think that Henderson will be a vital part of our team's, or another top team's(god forbid), midfield and a fantastic player.

They could have prevented death yes, but the ultimate cause was the number of people there.

The Sun was stupid to publish what they did, but the sun is stupid in a fair amount of things that they publish.

People keep talking about how, because we've changed 10 of 11 players, we don't care about the match. I'd say that's wrong. We've been doing big rotations of the squad over the last couple of games. De Vries, Stearman, Zubar (0_o), Peszko, Edwards, Davis, Hunt, Boukari and Sigurdarson are all arguably starters, and Batth had a good spell on loan, with Margreiter having something to proove. We're far from playing a weak, not caring squad.

Also, Ismail and Price are in the subs. Ismail, as you may know, was touted as the first £100m valued player (I think you even put a couple of million bid in for him a couple of years back), and both are from the youth squad. I hope they get a decent amount of playing time in the match.

So yeah, good luck, but not too much, and I hope theres a good match there tonight.

&gt;I Don't Like This Subreddit Because 80-90% Of The Users On Here Know nothing about the classic series..

Means you're in a rather slim minority. I love the idea of the older doctors and some of the episodes I've seen on pbs were entertaining but it's not something those of born after the series ended want to see. (Ok, not quite I was very young when it ended, I double checked just now.)

Also, what OP said just isn't true so I was being a little sarcastic and making the same kind of sweeping generalization. As I just said the show's not unwatchable the same way Day Time TV of it's era is unwatchable. I'm just saying it's not very interesting to watch. 

The only the most hardcore fans (the top 10% or less actually) watch the old series. Less because there's some like you who've seen it before, I'm guessing you probably watched it for the first time before the new series existed, who are watching it our of nostalgia. 

The show has aged to the point where no one is really curious about it, we can read about the old doctor on wikipedia and have our desire to know more sated.

I admire your faith in the free market but nothing will ""save"" the north short of a new currency. If you see London as a capitalist enterprise and representative of the financial sector, then ""the north"" would just be a colony, like India was. It's there to either be a subdued rival or a gouged conquered people. Every start up loan and mortgage is a slice of profits going to the same sector, and that same sector gets to govern what is allowed to start. Inequality is inevitable.

Another reason to hate ""the south"": the duchy of cornwall. Think about all the subsidies going to the monarchy, even if it were only 40 million per year (and this is what I meant about those without ethics hide behind legality BTW) like I said over time that's enough to create a self reinforcing wealth accruement. We know it's much more than that though.  That's billions with compound interest not going ""north"" and generally staying ""south"" (Edinburgh would be a special case.)

The same thing happens with in cities. Manchester is heavily divided even if you ignore Alderly Edge where most of the footballing pricks live. South Manchester is the university, south still Disbury, which has accrued the postgrads and thus became gentrified. Right next door is Moss Side, left next door is Burnage. I'll let you guess where I got knives pulled out on me. East Manchester has been largely uncared for, of course until a rich Arab wanted a new toy. Just a small dripfeed of ""impovement"" lead to a ghettoization. 350k - 500k houses close by perhaps unsellable ones, at least at one time. Not been there for a while.

It's because quality newspapers usually attract traffic by writing good stories, albeit with a degree of sensationalism. Daily Mail uses a completely different dynamic, which is getting people to click by creating a 'buzz' around a sense of outrage. It is essentially a troll newspaper, which is in the business of driving people to their site, to view the ads, whether they are angry or in agreement.

Having said that, there's no way we're going to have a separate subreddit for hosting the content, because it is a hassle and because it is of questionable legality. The best way to go about it is probably to have a self-post which quotes objectionable sections on an article, with a link provided if people want to investigate further.

The problem is that all the most likely candidates who have tenure at Spurs aren't every week starters; 
Gallas is already being pushed by Caulker, and when Kaboul comes back he's going to be dropped down to 4th in the rotation.

Parker is good, but Sandro is better on the ball and just as gritty making tackles. Sandro has played very well starting our attack out of the back, something I don't think Parker is capable of doing.

Brad is good and steady, but Hugo is taking over for him eventually, and likely sooner rather than later.

Benzema and Higuain went to City in a trade for Aguero and cash the first week in my save. That was a real 'fuck these people are messing around' moment. Definitely going to have to be careful in the transfer market. My plan is to build a youth squad and develop talent in house but that may be too hard to balance with overhauling the squad now.

IT's pretty complicated how to do it, but if you wait til tonight I can come back and give a full rundown of how I did it on 12, with those files for easy upload

edit: i used these files to get started http://fanchants.co.uk/football-team/liverpool/  
They have all the teams and a few songs/chants

edit 2: something i found here: http://fifa2012tips.blogspot.ca/2012/02/fifa-12-custom-chants.html

This is a tutorial showing how to import custom sounds in FIFA 12 PC :
1. create a folder called ""chants"" in C:\

2. create subfolders in it like menu music, entrance, team chants etc

3. download/place audio files in those subfolders. eg.place EPL entrance music in entrance.

4. create .m3u playlist by selecting the files in the subfolders. eg. right-click on EPLentrance.mp3 and select "" add to vlc playlist "" or "" add to "" WMP list ""

5. Then save the playlist in your default music folder. eg. C:\Users\Name\Music ( IMP - dont create any folder inside music folder, just save playlist there )

6. Its all done, import them into game and dont delete/move chants folder from C:/, otherwise custom sounds wont work....

Almost no one ever uses crosses into the 6 yard box so the fact that the defense is filled with short players wasn't a problem. What was a key factor here is that every player in the team had 85+ acceleration (except I think David Luiz). I always directed corners to Didier Drogba. During play, depending on space available I would always attempt finesse shots with the wingers or a powerful shot with Lampard. Other key factors included playing with an offensive high-pressure tactic with most crosses happening over the opponent's team and an anticipatory game played at the back.

And Solomon tells the Doctor to get stuffed, and the Doctor says ""I haven't got time to argue, then.  Goodbye.""  Same result, but less cruel.

There were other things the Doctor did in that episode I found out of character, for this Doctor and for any Doctor.  I can't accept the Doctor knowing he might be going someplace dangerous and deciding to round up ""a gang"" -- potentially endangering them all.  That's flat out wrong for him.  Also abducting Amy, Rory, and dad without asking them.  Also being an oblivious and angry dick about Brian's unexpected presence.  None of it felt right.  I came to feel Chris Chibnall just didn't have a good handle on the Doctor's personality at all.

I even thought of a way to fix all those things while I was watching the episode.  Imagine the Doctor is traveling in the TARDIS with Nefertiti -- which was an AWESOME idea and sadly wasted -- and she gets too much for him so he decides to visit Amy and Rory.  Only they've left the room, leaving Brian fixing the lights when the TARDIS materializes.  He steps into it, baffled, then Amy and Rory come back and see the TARDIS plus Brian is gone, look at each other and go ""uh-oh.""  They follow and in the confusion the TARDIS dematerializes...

SPOILERS FOR ""THE ARMAGEDDON FACTOR"" BELOW!!!

In the Fourth Doctor serial ""The Armageddon Factor"" there is a villain known as the Shadow whom the Doctor has foiled and escaped from. There is a warship commanded by the Marshall firing nuclear missiles at a planet the Doctor and friends have escaped to. The Doctor uses a form of misdirection to cause the missiles to lock onto the space station the Shadow and his henchmen are on rather than the planet he himself is on.

The only reason it has come out recently is precisely because the government at the time decided to not release the report. Instead using laws designed to protect state security to hide it.

What if your parents from different classes?

My Dad was a coal miner back in the day, then a joiner, then got an office job in his firm, then was unemployed for 2 years and is now a joiner again - without a doubt a working class guy. 

My mums parents were both teachers both quite well off and my mum got a fairly nice office job and has worked her way up to now be on £60k a year - arguably middle class.

So where would that leave me? I'd say I'm working class, I've followed in my mums footsteps (cushy office job as an IT Analyst) but I'd argue that as a person, I'm pretty working class as I've inherited my dads attitudes when it comes to greed and appreciating what you have, but at the same time I've primarily been brought up by my mum (Divorced when I was 2) so I've been used to a comfortable lifestyle and was relatively spoilt as a child.

The seating in the compound is a mixture of park-like benches and more ""holiday""-like chairs. Some of the chairs are at round tables with umbrellas (suggests food or drink available) but some are in groups of three facing outwards. There are a few tubs of flowers/shrubs.

Two of the benches face the dome but most of the seating seems to ignore it.

There seems to be temporary barriers round the dome and across the ""horse stables"" on the right. Possibly if this is a car park which has been taken over for a fair or craft day, the ""horse stables"" on the right might be bicycle sheds. If it was a fair I think the pic might have been taken before things started rather than afterwards. Clearly it was not while it was on! Alternatively perhaps it is some kind of picnic area, but that doesn't ring quite true,

It looks like there might be a sign on the dome (right hand side) but it is completely unreadable.

The complete lack of any people and the closed gates show that it is closed. But it doesn't look as if it has ever been open.

It always made me feel like I could take any episode, make up any random shit, and as long as it was good, it didn't matter what/how/why was explained during that episode. My crazy theory could always be right.

For example I always thought the Vashta Nerada were extra crazy/scary, doctor lied about the whole thing. They're super scary, super dangerous and super rare. As in that they are in fact crazy meat eating, immortal shadows and not some stupid swarm of insects/cells. They never bred or laid eggs in trees, were ever ""swarms"" etc. They're crazy ass shadows who do crazy ass things and the library seemed like the best place to be. One reason because so many people went there, eventually someone with a vastha nerada showed up. And two, because so many strangers showed up there, killing people, making them disappear, etc, would go unnoticed compared to any home-world, so hunting/killing/feeding was easy game for them in the library. 

It's always fun thinking of things like this when you're bored, because it always makes you feel like doctor who is this innocent kids show, until you think about it, until shit gets real, and then it's like ""HOLY SHIT"" and you feel terrified all over again and you pretend it's real, like the doctor was lying the whole time trying to make you feel safe/better/etc. And then you're like ""I can't believe I survived that, let's NEVER DO THAT AGAIN, EVER!"". 

I always wish that something along those lines happened with a companion. Like ""shit happens season 8"" and then in season 10 you find out, EVERYONE including the companion is terrified, and it's a whole WTF clusterfuck that makes you reconsider leaving your house, sleeping with the lights turned off, etc. Anything that changes the way you live your life from now on I would consider a success.

true,Geonnos,smith,Smith,"I would do a Dalek episode. But not just any Dalek episode. An episode where the Daleks truly win.

It would start off with the Doctor spending time on some planet and then Daleks swarm the entire planet. The Doctor rushes to try and help, but the Daleks begin to just obliterate the entire population. (If we follow from AoTD, and the Daleks have no memory of the Doctor, a few Daleks try to exterminate him, and show little concern after seeing him.) The Doctor rushes towards the TARDIS and finds the Daleks have taken it. The world has fallen to the Daleks.

-End of part 1-

The Doctor runs to save the planet's population, of which are being herded off into slavery. He manages to save a few humans before they are caught and brought to the ship that leads the invasion. The Daleks begin to execute everyone the Doctor was with, all being in single file line. The Doctor now fears for his life. 
He sees the TARDIS in the corner of his eyes and has to choose. Save the People, or run away and live another day. He manages to distract the Daleks long enough to get to the TARDIS and starts it up. The Doctor flees from the place and as he flies away, the TARDIS is shown leaving the Galaxy, which was being burned and destroyed. The Doctor picks up radio signals from all over the Universe. All screaming for help. Asking for someone to save them. The Doctor sheds a single tear and switches off the radio.

-End of Part 2-

Several weeks have passed and the Daleks are moving towards the Milky Way Galaxy. Several Galaxies have been enslaved and destroyed. Other species gather to Earth, hoping that by doing this, it would further the chance the Doctor can help, as Earth is so precious to him. Like in the Journey's End episode, we see previous companions, who are trying to figure out what is going on. Then the Daleks appear and the other Species fleets engage the Dalek Warships. Previous Companions of the Doctor devise a plan, take out the central control ship, and it would buy some time. Just as they are about to enact this plan, the Daleks enter and attack. 

The Cloister Bells suddenly go off, the TARDIS lands, and blocks the Dalek's lasers from hitting the previous companions. He tells them to get in and they rush in. Everyone notices the 10th Doctor regenerated into 11th, small comments, Jack flirts, etc. They fly into the middle of the control ship and talk to the Leader. The Leader doesn't recognize the Doctor or his companions, and (Explain! Explain! EXPLAIINNNN!). The Doctor gives the Daleks a chance. Leave. Leave this planet, this Galaxy, ALL the Galaxies they've taken. Or else. They 'laugh' and tell him he has no chance. He then activates a switch and suddenly, all the Daleks remember the Doctor and scream, part in fear and part in anger as they realize that they didn't kill him. The Doctor tells them that this is their end. 

The Daleks cringe as their ship begins to fall apart and for some reason they can't move. The Doctor walks back to his TARDIS, everyone else already in. Explosions go off behind him before he finally closes the door. The fleet begins to push back the Daleks and ask the Doctor to help stop the Daleks. He is now given a choice. Run from the responsibility like he has so many other times before, or stay and fight the Daleks, once more. The Doctor tells the fleet that they don't need him to defeat the Daleks. All they need is hope. Hope is what stops the Daleks everytime. The fleets rally behind the Doctor's words and begin to take back the worlds the Daleks have taken. 

-End of Part 3-

Throughout the season, the Doctor can see the worlds being taken back from the Daleks.

The season finale results with the Daleks losing the War on the other species. The Daleks all go into hiding, afraid of them. very few remain, leaving them to be used again in the future.

The point being that the other species, are something to fear, not only the Doctor, AND that the other species realize that the Doctor isn't always needed to save the day.

Thats only an Idea of mine I had a while ago. It has holes in it, but thats simply because it is an idea. &gt;_&gt; I wanted the Daleks to seem frightening, and this made them that in my eyes.

Still, given how ""Doctor Who"" has used specific dates for other events in the Ponds' timeline, and that these dates tend to roughly coincide with the present (i.e., the airing date of the episode, give or take a few months), I think we can still assume it's the present unless explicitly told otherwise. So unless some character whips out an iPhone 15, I'm going to assume the line about Rory being 31 was a writer's gaff (confusing the character's age with the actor who plays him).

true,[deleted],null,null,"Actually I don't like *either* of them when they're angry. Often because their anger makes no damn sense and is part of some weird moralistic nagging which doesn't actually make sense -- something I consider to be a serious weakness in recent Who.

A Town Called Mercy is a great recent example. The Doctor's moralising really gets on my nerves because it doesn't make any damn sense. There's a few problems with this...

Firstly, due to the rather long history of the show, The Doctor's moralising is often deeply, deeply inconsistent from year to year and even from episode to episode. One moment he's like ""gurr, guns are bad I don't like guns"" and the next he's like ""Wheeee, press the big red button which blows up the entire Cyberman fleet!""

Secondly, in an episode which was supposed to be all about a big moral dilemma, there's no *real* dilemma because we all know, thanks to the structure of the show, that nothing bad is actually going to happen. There's zero chance that the Doctor's insistence on not handing over the war criminal will result in the gunslinger carrying out his threat to kill the entire town, because the structure of a Doctor Who episode means that the threat will be resolved by some clever thinking and possibly judicious application of a Sonic Screwdriver at approximately the 39-minute mark, and that some resolution will magically appear which allows the guilty to be punished without the Doctor being obliged to actually pull any triggers. Real-life moral dilemmas have no such guaranteed resolutions.

What's the solution? Not to try and make the Doctor morally consistent, it's a bit too late for that... but instead to tone back on the show's occasional insistence on turning the Doctor into a po-faced moralizer telling everybody that ""violence is bad and never solves anything, how *dare* you think otherwise?"" while simultaneously reserving the right to blow shit up at random provided he's never *actually* filmed using a weapon.",0,1348628623,null,0,false,0,c6dj14c,t3_10gfze,t1_c6dj14c,t1_c6dgj0b,null,1429993021,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

After saving a remote village on a distant moon from an evil warlord in the episode's opening minutes, the Doctor realizes how much of an appetite you can work up exhausting yourself in the line of duty.

He considers that he hasn't done much ""stopping to smell the roses"" when it comes to sampling each world's local cuisine as of late and decides that he will amuse himself playing the role of intergalactic food critic because he's always wanted to be a snob.

As soon as he reaches his decision he heads off to his first locale...and another...and another; trouble is, every time he heads out to the Food Cart At the End of the Universe or wherever such place he tries going, a legitimate emergency crops up and he's torn away to play the hero. He can get just a nibble in before he's pulled away for a rescue, or explosions - the conventional bit.

At the end of maybe a half dozen day-saving bits, the Doctor finally sits down at a picnic bench to cram down a sentient hot dog and winces realizing that after those half-dozen nibbles, he's actually quite full and has lost his appetite.",0,1348630910,null,0,false,0,c6djlq5,t3_10h9lz,t1_c6djlq5,t3_10h9lz,null,1429993290,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

Cybermen, with their universe hopping tenancies enter the, wait for it- Marvel universe.  Tony Stark starts getting reports of a new terror organization using supposed Iron Man tech to kidnap people who are never seen again.  The only message these terrorists seem to have is 'delete'.

Stark investigates, fights some Cybermen, and begins to realize that these are not the ordinary Iron Men copies he is used to dealing with.  He discovers what they are actually doing, and as the cybermen spread it seems to be too late to stop them.  This is when, as Tony despairingly stares down an unopened bottle of vodka at the top of Stark Tower, a blue box appears in his penthouse.

The Doctor had noticed the energy given off when the Cybermen tore into the other universe, followed through the hole they left behind, and has arrived to solve the problem before it has a greater impact on the two universes.  

From there Stark and the Doctor would fight the Cybermen.  I know it is a pretty stupid idea, but it does combine two of my favorite things.

I liked the focus on the manager because he's so well spoken and confident in his philosophies. You can see he's very intelligent too. Can you imagine taking over a huge club like Liverpool FC and in the first meeting being told everything will be on cameras to be broadcast over the USA? That he'll be constantly giving interviews and footage on top of the massive task he faced with revitalizing club?

It's great that he's come off so well, so far. Of course the editors wouldn't allow it the other way but I'm impressed.

true,CopreaVonDedd,null,null,"I think it wasn't supposed to be about the aliens or the action or the excitement. The slow invasion was just an excuse to get the Doctor to live with the Ponds for a few months, so we could see their interactions as characters. During a regular episode, everything is so fast paced and exciting, it's hard to get a scene with the characters just hanging out and spending time together. Everything is always life or death. The Power of Three gave the viewers a chance to see the Ponds in their daily life, and what it's like for companions who aren't traveling with the Doctor anymore. I know they still go with him sometimes, and they went with him again at the end, but the point was to see how they go back to their daily lives at the end of their adventures and how they interact with the other people in their lives who aren't the Doctor.

I also enjoyed seeing the Doctor in a domestic environment. He's always out travelling the universe, fighting monsters, saving lives, and he never stops. The idea has been toyed with several times. In season two, when he and Rose got stuck on the asteroid in The Satan Pit. Again in season two when the links between Madame de Pompadour and the spaceship got disconnected. In season 5 when he had to wait for Vincent to paint the church.We got the biggest glimpse of ""normal"" Doctor in seasons five and six, with the Craig episodes, but in both of those episodes, even though he was staying in one place for a while, he was still working endlessly to find the problem and figure out a solution.

In the Power of Three, he couldn't do anything until he had more to go on, so he had to just... sit back and relax for a while. I thought it was entertaining to see him fidgeting on the couch when nothing had happened after four days of the cubes' first appearance. It's funny because we all know people like that. People who can't stand the thought of sitting still for more than 10 seconds and constantly need to be doing something to keep from going crazy. It seemed to humanize the Doctor a bit, and brought him down to our level. It felt like it was a way of saying ""he may save the whole of reality on a weekly basis, but even the Doctor isn't so different from the rest of us."" He eventually got better about being in one place for too long and fixed his stir crazy head by... playing Wii sports.

Most importantly though, I believe this episode was meant to set us up for the finale next week. The Ponds have been with us longer than any other companion, and Moffat has been saying since the beginning that their departure is going to be heartbreaking. Next week is their last episode, and I think having the Power of Three come right before the finale was good story telling. Even though we know the Ponds have been living normally for a good long while now, the fact that they show back up at the beginning of every episode makes it difficult to realize how long they've been on their own. The invasion was slow because we needed to get a better idea of how much time passes between the Doctor's visits. 

Personally, I'm pretty sure Moffat is planning on killing both of them in the finale. Or at least one of them. We need to realize how much time passes between their adventures because (again, this is just what I believe is going to happen, not an actual spoiler), after one or both of them die, we'll be able to look back at this episode and see what a normal life they had. Before this season started, I thought the Ponds were just going to pick up where they left off with their adventures and just keep traveling with the Doctor until they died, and I thought ""Well, that's really sad because Amy has known the Doctor since she was 7, spent the next 14 years of her life obsessing over him, then traveled with him for the rest of her life. She never got the chance to have a normal life. It's even worse because the Doctor *tried* to give her a normal life by dropping her off at the end of The God Complex. Now she's just going to fly away with him again, and probably get herself killed, and they should have just ended their adventures there because that's really sad.""

But since the new season started, I feel better about them leaving because I see now that they DO have a normal life. Two years between season 6 and the Christmas special, ten months between Asylum of the Daleks and Dinosaurs on a Spaceship, the slow invasion that took a year... They do have normal lives and normal friends and a normal marriage, and their lives don't revolve around the Doctor, and it's good to know that they get to have that normal experience before... whatever happens in The Angels Take Manhattan. Moffat says it's going to be a heartbreaking goodbye, so if he doesn't kill them, he's probably going to at least ruin their lives forever. I like knowing that before they go, at least they haven't missed out on a real life, and no episode brought that feeling home for me more than The Power of Three.",0,1348639574,null,0,false,0,c6dle2u,t3_10dd7j,t1_c6dle2u,t3_10dd7j,null,1429994133,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,str0yr,mcgann,McGann,"I had an idea for something of the scale intended for the 50th anniversary. It would require a build-up season of several episodes starring one of four Doctors each and would use Eleven as the main plot device. Jack Harkness would appear in said special along with many older companions. The reason I only include the four most recent Doctors is due to casting. Sheridan Smith still looks young enough to portray Lucie Miller, as Paul McGann could portray the Eighth with no problem (and has stated he would love the opportunity).

**First Episode**

The story starts with the Eighth Doctor and Lucie Miller having just saved a family from the Great Fire of London in 1666. As a thankyou, the father (an astronomer) gave The Doctor an opportunity to use his early telescope (how could the Doctor refuse?). When peering at the Moon, looking quite closely at its surface, he notices something not right (we don't see what). He and Lucie travel by TARDIS to the Moon to investigate.

**Second Episode**

Skip forward to Nine. Right in the middle of a tornado in 1948 Roswell, New Mexico with Rose Tyler, they've just discovered that this tornado in particular is an alien entity (hence why it's in Roswell and not Tornado Alley and why the Doctor is drawn to the event). During said adventure, Nine discovers that the entity was being used as an engine contained and compressed within the crashed Roswell alien spaceship had been let loose upon the world after the crash, had only grown to its current size due to an abundance of strange energy coming from the Moon. The Doctor and Rose go to investigate.

**Third Episode**

Captain Jack Harkness' adventure starts on a cruise. I haven't worked out much about this story yet as I think about Doctor Who storylines much more than I do Torchwood-based storylines. He uses his repaired vortex manipulator to travel to the Moon and investigate (The line by Dorium Maldovar is not confirmed to have been Harkness). I know that either or both Martha and Mickey tag along in this episode. **This isn't a vital episode, as Jack may have been researching the strange anomalies with Torchwood. Not showing this episode would have no effect on continuity.**

**Fourth Episode**

I haven't put much thought into the backstory of this episode, though I think it would be cool to do something based on the works of Lewis Carroll. Seems like a fun idea. A man who uses logic and knowledge to gain the upper hand, in a world where nothing makes sense. The alternate, backwards reality is discovered by Ten. It appears (seemingly) from nowhere. We don't find out the origin of this place until closer to the end of the episode when things begin to tie together. The Tenth Doctor and Donna Noble would feature in this episode. 

**Season Finale**
The three Doctors, Captain Jack Harkness and all of their companions meet up at various points throughout the episode in a hidden base inside the Moon. They slowly find that The Eleventh Doctor has been imprisoned by the Silence. The restraint system they've used also doubles as an energy siphon, draining regeneration energy from Eleven to power their base, his prison and the machine which gives the Silents their ""memory-proof"" abilities, only this machine produces a bi-product; antimatter. The antimatter is jettisoned into space and collides with normal matter releasing large amounts of energy. The exterior of the moon is actually part of a chameleon circuit, hiding the real identity of the moon as being the base of operations for the Silence. The vented antimatter is masked through use of a perception filter, however The Doctor notices it.

After defeating The Silence on the Moon and rescuing Clara using clues she left behind before she was captured and cryogenically frozen after Eleven was first captured (she managed to elude capture for some time, both have been in the moon for several hundred years), the memory machine goes critical and almost completely wipes the memory of every individual of the events which had taken place. This also explains how none of his previous regenerations remembered the previous one venturing to the Moon in the first place... The only character who will remember any of this at all is [Season 3 spoiler](#s ""The Face of Bo. Yes, I know it's only implied and never confirmed, but this would make perfect use of the setup provided by RTD back in 2007. Jack Harkness wouldn't remember this until some point well into his own future, as changes to his physiology allow him to remember. He was also the furthest from the blast, hence why the Doctor won't remember this."")

This story forever remains the one adventure The Doctor never knew he had.
****
**Notes**

- The memory-machine cannot run on energy produced by anti-matter, as anti-matter is only produced as a bi-product of using regeneration energy. It needs to be regeneration energy because no other energy has the correct 4th dimensional properties required to alter memory in the way the Silents do.
- The portal to the alternate reality seen in the fourth episode is created as an anomaly of the antimatter produced by The Silence. They'd been dumping the antimatter in the same location in space for hundreds of years, creating fatigue in the fabric of reality, which the TARDIS passed through by mistake.

Then Liverpool DOMINATED possession in the 2nd half, scored twice, only to have a linesman miss a blatant offsides that helped the other side score the equalizer in the 90th... THEN straight away from the next kickoff, and 1 second before the referee is about to blow the final whistle, the other team's striker sees Liverpool's keeper off his line and tries for goal from the midline, only to have our keeper CLEARLY (and I mean GOD DAMN CLEARLY) keep the ball from crossing the line, but the same linesman who missed the worst offsides of all time now comes running in to award to goal to the other side for the win...... THEN (stay with me) the premiere league suddenly adapts a video replay system, the referees all convene and watch the play from every different angle in super slo-mo, and somehow still come to the conclusion that the ball actually did cross the line and instantly award the other team the match...

So that's around 3.7% of them got caught by the agencies, which is the only time we act. We can't automatically tell what's legit and what's not, so we don't interfere on the whole.

BitTorrent is an incredibly abusive protocol for NATing routers, I've disliked the technology for this reason since I was at uni (10 years now, sigh).

My ""official""  advice has to be don't do it, but if you want to play the numbers game it's up to you. I think fines from the deans are around £30-£50 for first offences, providing you're honest.

The problem is cultural: mass car ownership, unsafe urban environment, mass spectatorship, advertising, supermarket deals, long working hours, little intellectual freedom, a loss of skills, a competitive sporting arena that ostracises those that need it the most, etc, etc. Learning isn't a choice it's an environment, and its a shame that most people have the ability to learn taught out of them. It's a guess, but I can imagine a sizeable number just don't have access to guardians and good role models that have a long term emotional stake in their well being, so that excludes teachers and the like. They have to be lucky to have informed and skilled parents, and if not it's almost an inevitable outcome. As for the parents what hope do they have after 40 years of living a particular life?

When Lucas is back, we can start rotating out Allen. The other positions in centre mid we can rotate, with Gerrard, Sahin, Shelvey, Henderson and Suso providing good options. BR has shown that he isn't afraid to use Suso and the other younglings, so I suspect we can see more of him this season. 

However, using current tactics and with injuries and suspensions, I think we'll see Sahin/Henderson/Suso in tonight's game. A full possible lineup could be Jones - Wisdom, Carra, Wilson, someone - Sahin, Henderson, Suso - Downing, Morgan, Pacheco.

He pays a lot for childcare, well it was his choice to have children.  My father supported 3 kids and my mum on his wages (mum only took part-time work once we were all in school), he did that by not living in an expensive house in an expensive area.

Why doesn't he use an NHS dentist?  http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/AboutNHSservices/dentists/Pages/find-an-NHS-dentist.aspx

He says his fuel bill has tripled but driving instructors don't exactly use a lot of fuel, nearly all their driving is local.  And the driving test is now a lot more rigorous than it was 20 years ago.  What he means is, the cost of fuel per litre has tripled.  But his fuel costs won't have tripled and as he runs his own business he's perfectly free to adjust his prices to keep his profit margin the same.  No, what he's complaining about there is that there's increased competition for work in his industry.

He says his wife is a nurse and is required to work from home.  Well that's her problem frankly, she should simply tell her employer that she will only work if paid to do so.  She can't be sacked for refusing to work for nothing.  And I do not believe she cannot get school holidays off work.  She must be booking her holidays too late.

Then he complains about holiday prices, well my family holidays consisted of living in a tent for two weeks.  We all loved it.  Camping costs next to fuck all, you don't need to fly abroad or stay in a hotel.  Children love staying outdoors.  They don't need organised activities you have to pay for, a rope swing in the woods and a frisbee or football is enough to keep them happy.

What is he on about bags of garden rubbish for?  Just buy a cheap self-assembly composter, then you don't need to go to the tip.  And he's paying £1450 in council tax which probably means he's living in something like a band C house - so why not downsize to a lower band, like A, which is what I'm in?


In short, they're both working, I bet they both drive cars, they have children, they live in a reasonably expensive house and they go on organised family holidays.  They pay for private dentistry too.  And he's moaning that it all costs a lot of money.

true,geekchic,null,null,"&gt; It's too expensive.

&gt; I shop at Aldi; It's really not.

Once you are in the habit of cooking from scratch for yourself it is indeed a lot cheaper.

However, the migration process can be very expensive - you need to have spare food just in case the experiment goes wrong, but frankly the cost of buying all those little used ingredients up front can be ruinous.

I love curries, and my spices budget the other week was over £20. Yes, that will last months, and I can cook very cheap veggie curries as a result. However, when I was broke there would have been no way that I could have afforded to ""invest"" £20 upfront to save more than that over the next few months.

Given the choice, as it looked to me, of spending £4 on a curry or £25 on ingredients to make lots of curries (if I could manage it, maybe), then it really isn't that difficult to see why people are trapped into sticking to either very bland home cooked meals, or relying on ""tv dinners"".

I really do have some sympathy for people who want to cook for themselves, but lack the cash to cover the cost of migrating to that process.

In fact, I have often wondered if there isn't some merit in some sort of social-club in some areas where people learn the necessary skills and share the cost of the up-front expensive ingredients - and after a few months are given a ""starter pack"" to help them carry on.

He could be self-employed as a contractor for a driving school.  Technically he's his own boss, but his 'company' is hired by the school.  I used to see that a lot in IT.

Local is generally urban, so the least economical/most expensive sort of driving there is.  This is just back-of-the-envelope stuff, but if each hour's lesson averages 20 miles and he's getting 30mpg that's a full 60l tank every two a half days.

Bob Crow states it succinctly;

*“With the judge not even likely to decide on whether or not Virgin have a case for judicial review until mid-October, and that decision then likely to be subject to further legal challenge, this fiasco, rooted in the crazed world of rail privatisation, could drag on for months. It’s time for the Government to end the uncertainty for passengers, and the 3200 West Coast staff, and to announce renationalisation, with effect from 9th December, right now.”*

Considering 70% the British public are in favour of renationalisation of the West Coast Mainline, he's pretty much correct in what he's saying. The government are making decisions (or a lack of) based on ideaology rather than common sense - just like they're doing with the NHS.

QPR was an excellent experiment, and avbs half time adjustments prove this. His original thought didn't work so he implemented a 'seemingly obvious' tactical change. It worked.

true,tangled_foot,uk,The Toon,"You really really don't. My job means I move around the world (all post-colonial Enlgish speaking countries) for about 6 months at a time, with 6 months in the UK inbetween. 

When I move to a new place I have nothing and everything I buy I give to charity when I leave,

Utensils wise, a big pan (which can also go in the oven) a small pan (with a lid), a frying pan and a chopping board. I've never spent more than £10 on these four, I often buy second hand though. I take my own knife, because a good knife is expensive, but that is a luxury, you can buy a good enough one for £5.

Food wise I buy curry power, chill power and mix herbs, oil, some stock cubes and salt and pepper. They are your overheads, that's what you need to have to cook pretty much everything. I also like chinese food so I've started adding soy sauce, fish sauce and sesame oil to that list, but these are new additions.

From that point on you buy ingredients on a meal by meal basis and I think I can pretty much cook everything that people like to eat (actually, I just thought, I did once buy a stick blender for soups - that was very useful, and a grater once, I think that was a waste of time).

I'm not sure all these TV cooks help things, they all go into interesting and somewhat complicated dishes but in reality its not difficult, and they often make it seem like you need lots of utensils and ingredients, but you can dismiss most of what they say.

People try to complicate stuff too much, if I could be arsed I would set up a website with everything I cook on, because I don't think I ever go above £1-2 a meal per person and I don't think I ever really spend longer than 20 minutes or so cooking either (my rule is put the pasta/rice/potatoes on first, have everything finished by the time they're cooked), and I usually budge for £20 to buy the things I need to start cooking when I move somewhere new, I usually get away with more like £10-15 depending on the country.

But stuff like this isn't obvious, Jamie Oliver has the right idea imo, he's very laid back with what ingredients he uses and he style encourages people to play around with food, same as Nigel Slater although a lot of people don't like his presentation style.

I think we have a lot of overweight people who have a lot of complex problems, we have no effective infrastructure to help these people, and they're passing on their flaws to their children.   

Even if someone who is obese goes to the doctor that doctor has almost no ability to help that person. The only tools in that doctor's bag are a free gym trial, ineffective pills, and surgery (at the extreme).

 - Exercise is related to physical fitness, heart health, and reduces your diabetes risk.    

 - Diet changes (i.e. less sugar, less carbohydrates) will reduce your weight and also help your long term diabetes risk.    

You consider these schemes convoluted because you also consider the problem ""simple"" and just think educational initiates plus more exercise is some kind of magic bullet.    

The problem with this thinking is that historically it hasn't been effective. We have had tons of education schemes and we have had tons of exercise schemes (including mandatory exercise in schools already). These have resulted in an **increase** in percentage overweight.

It used to be around 30-40/week when we were both students and in then in first jobs. 

With two fairly decent incomes we've expanded our budgets. Additionally, I used to include packed lunches for both of us in that budget. We both get lunch from work now, so that's an added bonus.

It's not rocket science but I can suggest a budget, cupboard/freezer items and our weekly/monthly food rotation.

A quick look at wikipedia says that its got an empty weight of 286 tonnes and max takeoff of 380 tonnes. Lets be generous and say that the entire weight is for fuel. So thats 94 tonnes of fuel.

Range of 2000km over cruising speed of 450kmh is 4.4 hours endurance, so it will burn about 21.36 tonnes of fuel per hour.For comparison, the Boeing 747 burns about 15 tonnes an hour and carries around 350 people.

In kilometers/litre (where avgas is about .72kg a litre) thats about 0.015 kilometers a litre. So one litre of fuel gets you 15 metres.

Comparing with trains, a bit of searching gives me a figure of 0.5 miles per gallon for an HST which is about 0.212 km/l - so about 14 times more fuel efficient* before you even start to get into passengers carried.

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"*(Disclaimer - I don't actually use twitter or know much about how it works so I might be mistaken on some things. I'm just putting my opinion out there to get the discussion going.)*

As far as I can tell one of the problems is Twitter's tagging process falls somewhere between public statements and directed messages.

If I was under the impression that ""OP is a fag"" then I could leave a comment somewhere on reddit saying ""EquanimousMind is a fag"", and I'm pretty sure free speech would mean I'm not breaking any rules. If I sent EquanimousMind a PM saying ""You're a fag"" then that could be seen as needlessly offensive/abusive, and if I overdid it I might be prosecuted for harrassment and bullying.  
AFAIK most of these ""twitter arrests"" occur when someone tweets using the ""@"" symbol, which sends the tweet as a message to the tagged person. So I could say ""You are a fag @EquanimousMind"" and EquanimousMind would recieve that message, and everybody on twitter would be able to see it.

In my opinion, that is where the line should be. Just because twitter (and youtube and facebook etc.) makes it cheap and easy to send direct messages doesn't change the fact that it is still a direct message. Just because the message is available to read by the general public doesn't change the fact that it's a direct message. I think it's fine for a comedian to go on TV and say ""Tony Blair is a tosser!"" as a joke, I think it is quite different for a comedian to go on TV and say ""Look at this letter I sent to Tony Blair calling him a tosser!"" though.

We have laws, if you break them you should be punished.

If the punishment isn't harsh enough, then it's the punishment that should be changed. Justice, not some self-gratifying vengeance.

The key issue is: Did he break the law? The police officer clearly didn't think so.

There was no King/Queen of Wales since the territory's conquest by Edward I, and even before then it wasn't a unified country like Scotland was, so there wasn't a single monarch claiming absolute power over the entire country. As for Ireland: at the time, there was no Northern Ireland (Northern Ireland has only existed since the Partition of Ireland in 1922). I believe that the title King of Ireland was automatically help by whoever was the King/Queen of England. The Acts of Union (1707) combined England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain, so the King/Queen of Britain was automatically the King/Queen of Ireland; in 1800 the Act of Union formerly combined the Kingdom of Great Britain with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. It stayed this way until the Irish Free State broke away, the remainder becoming the Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as it is today.

Insurance: If you have a motor vehicle then you will need to have motor insurance by law. If you are renting poperty then you might want to consider contents insurance to protect your own belongings.

 2.
Banks: It changes depending on what they are offering. No point in deciding now as the various deals will have changed by the time you move.

 3.
Phones: Depends what you want. You need to think about what sort of balance of calling minutes, SMS texts and data you expect to use. Then look at the various deals on offer (again this will have changed by the time you get here) so you might as well wait until nearer the time. There are several chains like Carphone Warehouse and Phones4U that will compare the deals from several providers (I think the Carphone Warehouse website is quite good for helping you compare various deals). As for coverage it depends where you are. Providers usually have quite good coverage maps so you can compare coverage for where you expect to be moving to.

**Tax Rate**

I think the tax rate for your salary will be 40%.  Check this link (scroll down to Income Tax rates and taxable bands) - http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/it.htm

**Pets**

Some owners allow pets, other don't.  I have never heard of paying extra to allow a pet.  If it is a flat, and there is a policy that covers the whole building that states no pets, it is highly unlikely that you'll be able to keep a pet.  Some buildings have Building Management companies that will enforce rules, regulations and policy.  

**Vacation**

This will be stipulated in your contract.  Typically the senior the position, the more leave you will get.  I speak under correction, but when I lived in the UK, many people seem to speak of 20 or 21 days leave as standard for full time jobs.  The number of days increase with each full year in service.

In the UK we have Pay As You Earn (PAYE) for income tax and social security. On £45,000 your typical take home salary will be £33,000 so your employer will automatically deduct your tax at a monthly rate leaving you with roughly £2,750 per month.

Speak to the landlord, you will find many will be okay depending on what you're bringing.

3) 20-25 days + public holidays is normal so you'll get at least your 5 weeks. 

4)No insurance is essential. NHS provides adequate cover however private options are available, usually £50-80pm. Car insurance is required if you have a car. If you're in London don't bother with a car.  Car insurance is horrendous here. 

5) Banks &amp;amp;amp;amp; phones are much of a muchness, similar deals and generally cheaper than in Norway. I guess if you're calling back to Norway you might want to try Lycra or Libera mobile as they only cost 1p / minute for calls abroad.

Tax - The UK tax system is pretty complicated (no surprises there!). You will have to pay Income Tax on your earnings:

In the 2012/13 tax year the first £8105 you earn is tax free.
Between this and £34370 the rate is 20%
Between £34371 and £150,000 the rate is 40%

There is another tax called national insurance that you have to pay as well. Like income tax, this is all organised by your employer through the PAYE system (Pay As You Earn), this is ostensibly to pay for things like the NHS.

For example, I never have to worry about paying my taxes, it is automatically taken out of my pay by my employer; it will probably be the same for you.

[This](http://www.thesalarycalculator.co.uk/salary.php) will give you a rough idea of how much tax you will pay. According to this, if you earn £45000 a year, you will end up getting £32,881 a year, or £2740 a month, after your taxes have been paid.

Lastly, when you are looking for a place to live you need to think about council tax. This is a tax at a local level that pays for things like rubbish collection, local services, police etc. The amount you pay is based on the value of the property you live in, and you can get a reduction of 20% if you live there alone. The exact details vary from area to area, so check the local borough council website.

[Direct Gov](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/index.htm) is the UK government website, where you can find lots of answers to questions you will have if you come to live here. For example [this](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/Employees/Timeoffandholidays/DG_10029788) page tells you about holiday entitlements. If you work full-time, with a 5 day week, you will probably have about 28 working days of holiday each year, which may or may not include British bank holidays. 

Unless you are going to a remote area then cellphone coverage probably won't be a problem, best idea is to ask in store. The UK cellphone market is very competitive, and I'm sure there are several companies (eg. O2, vodafone, 3, Orange, Tesco, etc) who could all offer you a good deal. I have always been with O2 and never had a problem. 

As for insurance, it's probably similar to Norway. I don't think you will need medical insurance (check this), you will probably be covered for free by the NHS for most things. Your employer may offer medical insurance as an extra benefit, but this counts as salary so you pay a little more tax if you have it. Other than that, life insurance, home insurance and similar things are optional, but not essential. Again, there are many many companies that offer these insurances, you should check several for a good deal.

If you own and drive a car you MUST purchase insurance for it, it's the law. You must pay an annual road tax and have an annual safety inspection called an M.O.T.

I don't mean to be aggro, but you speak like it's a certainty.  Where's the actual *evidence* of this?

And I don't think Moffat has anything to do with the contrived theories constantly dreamed up in the fevered imaginations of the fans.  

Last year it was mirrors.  Everybody was convinced that there was some vitally important message in all the shots of mirrors, and went all quiet about it after it turned out not to be the case.  

Even better was the two-time streams theory.  There was *definitely* something going on with double realities throughout the series!  One minute the Doc couldn't do rubik's cubes, then he could!  Wibbly wobbly!  And in the episode where the deck of cards changed!  PROOF!  And of course there were definite signs that the real Doctor was a Ganger.  In the end, it amounted to a load of coincidences, imagined connections and production errors.

All these fan theories are fun, but they nearly always turn out to be completely wrong.  Moffat really isn't messing with you guys, you're just seeing things that aren't actually there.

Essentially it means you only buy a share of the property but you and the girlfriend are the only ones that live there.  It's a little work around they've introduced to circumvent the challenges of getting on the property ladder, and when you sell your 10% share, or whatever it might be, then that's your return and down payment for your next property/business/holiday/drug habit/whatever.  Typically the schemes have to run for at least 5 years but you're allowed to sublet - so if you're committed to 4 years in the UK and want somewhere possibly much nicer to live for possibly less money, *and* an investment, that's a choice available.  You can then sell/rent (sub-let) your share which you couldn't do if all you'd done is rent in the first place.  It might be something worth considering.

With a £45k salary the banks should offer far more on a mortgage than you would ever really need, even in a property very close to the city centre.

Exactly. I think people mistakenly assume that a twitter message automatically falls into that category, but the reality is that at some point, someone is going to log on to twitter and recieve that as a message - no different to opening a letter or answering a phonecall.

true,ArtistEngineer,australia,Cambridgeshire,"I recently moved here, my biggest problems were:

* credit rating - I'm a 40yr old professional with a house deposit in the bank, but I couldn't do much because I had a zero credit rating. bizarre. Not sure how the EU handles credit ratings. you have to build this up slowly. I got turned down by Santander! They said I wouldn't pass a credit check, so I asked them why I needed a credit check when I was the one lending *them* my money. They suggested I go to Lloyds.

* Lloyds bank seem to be the easiest to get a bank account with. Luckily I already had an old bank account with them from when I lived here 15yrs ago - and it was a lot easier to get a bank account.

* Mobile phone reception can be complete crap in some areas with some providers. So maybe try a few pay-as-you go SIM cards and see how the reception is where you live and work. They support number portability, so don't worry about losing your number.  http://giffgaff.com/ are cheap and good. Go to a carphonewarehouse http://www.carphonewarehouse.com/ and see what deals they have.  *Three* are cheap but their coverage is poor. Beware if you're not in a major city!

* once you have an address, and a bank account, you might be able to get a pay-monthly phone plan. This will build up your credit rating and you'll get a better deal.

* shop around for car insurance and keep shopping. Because I'm a foreigner, I was initially quoted £1500 for comprehensive, I eventually got it down to around £500 I think. Still expensive, and I had to swap my Australian license for a UK one, and get my Australian insurer to prove my no claims bonus. I've been driving since I was 15, and I've never had an accident.

* looking for rentals in the UK is completely crap. They have ~~parasites~~ people called ""letting agents"" who will charge you fees for everything they can.  It's really bad after coming from Australia where the most you have to pay for a lease is $25 in fees - governed by law. They will charge you for credit checks, and since you've just arrived you may well have to pay 6 months rent in advance, and possibly require a guarantor (for which you also pay a fee). You can pay almost two weeks worth of rent in these fees. i.e. you're being charged to be a consumer. It's corrupt. 

* the good news is that there is PLENTY of work here in tech/IT/engineering. Something like a couple weeks after I had arrived I applied for two jobs, I got two interviews, an offer the next day, I negotiated a higher rate and I started work the following Monday. All done within the week. Pay is crap though (because of the weak £) compared to other countries.  You don't need a credit check, or an address to start work. Just a bank account and a National Insurance number - but this is easy to get.

TL;DR - it's easier to get a job in the UK than it is to get a bank account, house to rent, or a mobile phone plan.",0,1348672429,null,0,1348693471,0,c6dplnw,t3_10i5xi,t1_c6dplnw,t3_10i5xi,null,1429996178,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

The company exploits BBC brands, sells BBC and other British programming for broadcast abroad with the aim of supplementing the income received by the BBC through the license fee.
In the year to 31 March 2010 it made a profit of £145m on a turnover of £1.074bn.[1] The company had made a profit of £106m on a turnover of £1,004m in the previous financial year.[2] **In the year to 31 March 2011 BBC Worldwide's headline profits were up 10.3% to £160.2m - its highest level ever.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The Doctor tells Nefertiti that they need to pick up the Ponds (meaning he intended to get Amy and Rory). Then, to pick up Amy and Rory, he materialized the Tardis around them, and since Brian (Rory's dad) was nearby, the Tardis materialized aroung him as well.

Also, while the Tardis is still materializing around them, the Doctor starts speaking to Rory and Amy. And there is nothing in his tone that implies that it is a surprise to see either of them (which makes sense seeing as he told Nefertiti that he planned on picking them up). 

Now, he doesn't notice that Brian is there until after they are already on the space ship. Then the Doctor notices, asks who the new guy is, Rory explains that Brian is his dad, and the Doctor scolds Rory, telling him that ""he can't just bring his dad along"", to which Rory replies ""you materialized around us"". Then the Doctor is okay with it.

What I took away from that is that the only reason Brian was dragged along was his close proximity to Amy and Rory when the Tardis materialized. So, Tardis materializes around Amy and Rory, and because Brian was between them, the Tardis couldn't help but materialize around Brian as well. Meaning it wasn't the Doctor's or the Tardis's doing, but was just a bit of an accident.

Unless someone knew the Doctor was going to materialize the Tardis around Amy and Rory to pick them up, and also knew that if they messed with the Pond's lighting, Brian would come over to help fix it. And also knew that the Doctor would need two people of the same gene chain in order to make it out of the Silurian ship alive.

Additionally, there is a part of Ep 2 where Amy is talking to the ship's computer and it is doing everything that she wants it to do. I don't know that she's ever demonstrated an ability to operate alien computers before. Could possibly be Oswin listening in, and hacking the computer to do what Amy is telling it to do.

What you say on the Internet isn't real in the conventional sense. All it is is some basic text on a webpage that somebody has consented to view, it's not a physical/verbal assault because the person who is being abused can back out of the webpage at any time. This is why saying (for example) ""@Rioferdy5 is a nigger"" online (while deplorable &amp; I'd argue that it perhaps warrants action from Twitter if it breaks the TOS) is not the same as running up to Rio Ferdinand in the street &amp; saying ""You're a nigger,"" it's not the same because he can back out at any time.

It's also not the same because you're insulting him with a veil of anonymity &amp; a barrier of digitalness between you &amp; the person you're insulting. The person you're insulting doesn't see your emotions as you say it &amp; doesn't see how you say it - both of which (in my view) are actually far more critical, as to whether it's verbal abuse or not, than  the mere words. You should be think-skinned online. Hell, I get called a ""fucking teadrinking whore bastard faggot"" every time I go online - does this mean under Brit law I could prosecute them (or at least get the CPS to pursue them), it probably does - which is fucked up. 

It boils down to, if you're not thick-skinned then you shouldn't consent to view the page.

I hate to sound like one of those crazy American conspiritards, but the precedents being set by these Twitter abuse cases will be used in court against somebody like you or me for slandering somebody as a joke online - be it in /r/circlejerk, 4chan or in a private chat.

true,Robotochan,cnty-england,Ashby-de-la-Zouch,"&gt;There are ways to improve democracy so that it is more democratic, number one would be to get rid of FPTP and go with STV with a ten MP per district minimum

But the people have already decided and they want to keep FPTP. Was AV a great system... no, there are better ones. But it was still considerably better than FPTP where more votes are discarded and the individual has less power to change things. Yet it got absolutely destroyed in the referendum.

Now the question is 'why didn't they want change?', which is where the concept of tradition democracy falls over. People don't vote for what they want or what they think is best, they vote for what they are told/convinced to vote for whether through fear or simply having a pretty face. Obviously this does not apply to everyone, but the masses who read The Sun/Daily Mail and it's like are in the majority and cancel out the votes of those who properly thought about it. God forbid should we have a vote on the EU, where a large majority will vote against those ""filthy foreigners"" for no logical reason, and we all may pay the price.

&gt;Is it right for laws to be passed on a population that doesn't want them, even if they are the ""best"" policy

As opposed to now... where the exact same happens but the goal appears to be for the benefit of those in charge rather than the people they serve. Look at the recent response to changes to the Lords from those in power. A lot of them see themselves heading that way and don't want to spoil anything, and so we still have a religion involved in politics.

I'd also add household heating/energy bills.  I'd actually argue this to be grounds in favour of an apartment over a terrace/deatched house, and new build over an older property.

The other thing in terms of budgeting for tax is Council Tax, which the local authority will send you a letter and bill you for.   Council Tax pays for the local amenities; street cleaning, local schools and parks, services like rubbish collection - that sort of thing.  It's measured not by income but by location and property.  In this sense settling for a smaller apartment house, even if you can afford more, in some sense can seem more of a saving than it first seems, and similarly it might just push what property is within your budget, out.

Also I should point out the most important idea of what I said was to have a federal system. If you look at the US, Canada, and the UK, I think most people would agree that the nation that has it the best together is Canada. It is the only one out of the three that has a strong economy. It is the only nation out of the three without runaway debt at less than 20 USD per person in debt. Their government does more than the US but manages to spend less when comparing federal and state to federal and provincial spending.

This is because out of the three Canada is the only one that has a non-overlapping federal system. Unlike the federal-unitary hybrid that is the UK, and abortion of a government that is the overlapping US federal system, the Ottawa isn't expected to get its fingers into every problem inside Canadian borders.

That is, when I'm successful at doing so. For example, I was surprised at so many of the inception cast being included in the dark knight rises. I didn't know **anything** about the movie beforehand, so I thought it was awesome when JGL and Marion Cotillard showed up. I similarly also got an awesome feeling when Sam Jackson showed up at the end of Iron Man, something that hadn't been announced beforehand. And then of course every time Moffat gives us a crazy ending to an episode or season, or some of the earlier epic moments like Bad Wolf Rose, the appearance of The Master, The Doctor-Donna, etc. Unfortunately I was spoiled on who River Song was (and just a day before I watched the episode) and I simply did not get the same kind of awesome feeling.

No. No she doesn't.

Queen Nefertiti asks if Amy is a queen because Queen Nefertiti assumes everyone who travels with the Doctor must be important in their society. Amy, realizing this, fumbles with her words for a moment and covers for her lack of importance by claiming she's a queen.

Edit - Here's a transcript:

Amy: Who are you, anyway?

John: John Ridell, big game hunter in the African plains. I'm sure you've heard of me, too.

Amy: No.

John: Well you clearly have some alarming gaps in you're education.

Amy: Or, men who hunt defenseless creatues just don't impact on history. Face it, she's way cooler than you.

Nefe: And you, Amy, are you also a queen?

[Pause]

Amy: [[With upward inflection](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYmSUSwYsPU)] Yes. [With, what appears to be, a forced conviction] Yes I am.

Dunno about that.  'Arry did have a certain degree of instinctive tactical nous, and I tended to think he substitutions were useful.  AVB, on the other hand, made some poor substitutions in our opening home games, trying to close out games too early.
