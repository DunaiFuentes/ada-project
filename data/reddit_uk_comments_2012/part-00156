It might be worth noting that there aren't as many minorities in the UK as in the US, if that's where you're asking from. According to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom#Ethnicity) the UK is 90% white, while the [US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States#Race_and_ethnicity) is 72%. The US population is 12% black, the UK is less than 1% with several other minority groups ahead of them.  

So considering that of the *main* companions since the reboot (Rose, Mickey, Martha, Donna, Amy, Rory) 2/6 were black (2/7 if you want to throw Captain Jack in there)... they're actually being statistically over represented.

&gt; Point out where we remove any comments that contain memes, swearing, etc. The only comments removed are for piracy and slurs.

This has changed, but the bot did at first delete a comment of mine with an f-bomb in it.  But, of course, I can't point that out, since it was deleted.

&gt; 13 is a child. Regardless, people under 13 use the site. Also regardless, nobody should have to be exposed to offensive slurs, no matter their age.

In the words of George Carlin, the radio has two knobs - one changes the station; the other turns it off.  If the users of this subreddit don't want to see it, they can downvote the posts.  If it's particularly offensive, a human mod can delete it, or edit the user's post.  Conversely, if it doesn't get downvoted, then obviously the majority are OK with it.  So, what you've done here is project your morals onto others, and I, for one, find that particularly and singularly offensive; more offensive by an order of magnitude than the stuff in the paragraph below.

Basing this on a regular expression is what lead, in the 1990's, to l33t sp34k.  This is another reason why bots fail, and why it is folly to rely on them; and another tick in the column of free-and-open discussion, not censorship. (insert leet speak racial slurs).  The bot isn't going to catch that, and it'll never catch everything, so you're just going to escalate the situation, alienate people who want free speech, and not actually solve the problem.

&gt; Reddit is not a democracy, and if you think otherwise, you delude yourself. The users decide which pieces of content are the most or least interesting, nothing more.

... When the entire function of the site is to deliver content in a ranked order, and the users decide the ranking, how is that conceivably anything other than democracy?  

The term originates from the Greek δημοκρατία (dēmokratía) ""rule of the people"", which was coined from δῆμος (dêmos) ""people"" and κράτος (kratos) ""power"".  When the people have the power to determine the content that is presented, that's democracy.

Nope.  Doesn't matter one bit.  There's no uproar.  There's a very, very small group of people who are exceptionally vocal.  This ""uproar"" consists of approximately 0.005% of the population of the subreddit... 

People are upset that rules are being enforced, because they feel that they could ""get away with it"" if the bot wasn't better at catching violations than the mods ever could be (because it can monitor every comment and every post, and *no* number of mods can effectively do that).

Whether it's what someone wants is of virtually no importance when compared against whether it performs the task that it has been assigned to do.  If it was broken and misbehaving, it would be a different story.  Even then, the programmatic rules can simply be adjusted.

For the record, I'm going to change my post, but I completely disagree with you that they're unnecessary.  They very succinctly make the point that your bot is ineffective at its stated goal: it can't protect people from seeing bad things; it often gets things wrong; and people don't want it here.

Clearly the ""c"" word was said in this post, which may be a ""swear word"" but is not a racial slur.  Since you specifically asked ""Point out where we remove any comments that contain memes, swearing, etc."", here's one.

http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/128h7t/russell_t_davies_pitched_a_doctor_who_graphic/c6t112h

Censorship, plain and simple; not against any rules, just the Mods deciding what's best and projecting their ethics onto others.


I mean, I can go on, dude, but the fact is that the bot sucks.  It is ineffective at accurately doing the things you say it's here for, and it has an extremely high failure rate.  Every link I posted above is an example of a wrong, or potentially wrong, action taken by the bot, and that's just the bot's first page of posts on its user page.

I did history, but I think in first year you do 3 for PPE.

Every week you will have a have a number of tutorials. For PPE this is normally two. You will have to write an essay or do economics problems for every one of those tutorials. Every essay questions will have its own individual reading list.

I suspect you would have around 30-40 tutes over the course of first year. So you would have 30-40 reading lists of several pages worth.

This is me extrapolating from my own experience in history.

I'll see if I can have a look, but the faculty reading lists now are located on subject locked areas, and aren't publicly accessible.

Also, and this is key really, most of the reading lists will be designed by your tutor. There is really no standardisation at Oxford, except in terms of the exams taken at the end. Its up to the tutor to get you there as they see fit.

That reading list is essentially a fiction to give students something to do over the holidays before they start when they keep asking. It has no bearing on the course, and is mostly for overly keen 18 year old geeks who have finished their A levels, and don't realise they should just go on holiday.

That being said, I am so fed up with this kind of rationale that I just had to get it out. 

Look at the first chance Torres had here:
http://www.footytube.com/video/chelsea-v-fc-shakhtar-donetsk-140874?ref=wv_relbox
Again and again I see him hesitate, not take a shot (presumably out of fear of missing) and seem frustrated afterwards. People say he hasn't got a chance, but he's got plenty. The chances that he's converted have been mostly out of speed and acceleration. That's all fine and great but we don't need another winger, we need a STRIKER. As in strike the ball. As in shoot the ball when there is a glimmer of a chance. You can't argue with the fact that he looks scared when he has an opportunity and the ball is usually snatched from him before he has a chance to shoot. He's scored 11 in goals so far for Chelsea. 11. A fellow blue posted this here and I thought it was pretty insightful: 
http://www.weaintgotnohistory.com/2012/11/6/3609980/chelsea-fc-romelu-lukaku-awesome-fernando-torres-poo

I respect Torres for how he has handled this slump in his career and love the fact that he's stuck with us and thanks the fans when he gets a chance. Thats absolute class for me. But I have no shame in saying that I want a better striker. One that's more confident and one that creates chances instead of finishing them.

I've just taken the time to quickly study it over the past week. Remember, we're not in a peak time.

But on the average of 10,000-20,000 unique users this subreddit gets per day, It only removes around 5-6 items per day on a slow day (some items it doesn't do a comment on, mostly due to it not being needed). Over the past week, it's been right just more than 95% of the time (You could reduce that to 90% if you were being lenient on some self-posts). That's an average of less than 1 screw-up per day. That figure could probably be made a lot more accurately if I did more time, if a few people wanted.

(I would point out that some users delete their posts, making it impossible for us mods to see the original content too)

What I am saying is (ignoring all the other arguments for and against for now)...we're very happy to reverse it, and would do it very quickly too, if it was incorrect. The bot would delete and reply to something within a few minutes of it being posted. Most of the time, the submitter is still around then anyway, but I'm sure they would definitely come back within a day or two. If it was removed incorrectly, all they would need to do is send a very quick message just letting us know. Most of the time, the user just moves on, downvotes the reply and/or simply deletes their post.

Speaking personally here, it's hard to find the will in caring myself sometimes when users, in general, do not care about their removed posts by the bot. It's worth pointing out that the way this whole discussion started is 2 users practically suggesting putting a script for an upcoming episode onto TPB, and those posts being removed. Neither of the original users actually posted again after saying that, and everyone who is suddenly complaining about the bot (BTW, it has been running for a good 5 or so months, why now?) never actually saw the original posts to know if it were correct or not.

You may raise a point that swear words are contextual, and I agree with you. Unfortunately technology is at a point where it is unable to discern context yet, so misclassifications happen. We actually do trawl thru the bot's logs to approve contextually appropriate posts.

To the previous poster that feels that police need better supervision, you are incorrect. We are now so over-supervised and over-accountable we're largely ineffective. You daren't deal robustly (in the true sense of the word, not the politicians sense) with offenders for fear of complaint.
If I deal with a criminal by the book, there's a 50-60% chance he's getting away with it. If he then gets all self entitled and complains about me, or the way I investigate a job, I'm dragged through a complaints process that lasts months. It's not done fairly and you're guilty until proven innocent and sometimes beyond then!

Tl;dr: PCC's are a waste of time and the police are far too accountable as it is.

Probably because the finances behind all of the deals above are so awful; Carroll, Henderson and Downing are all on silly wages that far exceed their worth and place in the squad. 

Of the bunch, I'd be most disappointed to see Henderson leave, because it really would be a case of a player's future being ruined purely because of financial considerations. But the 70k/wk he's on, where he's currently our 5th-choice central midfielder, would be enough to fund a genuine first XI player for the final third. Rodgers basically feels that the money freed up by selling Henderson is more valuable than Henderson himself.

As for Enrique, I don't think any club with top 4 pretensions should have to ""protect"" one of its fullbacks, no matter how attacking they are.

Are you expecting to hear the words ""cover up"" in the clip?

true,sinhaug,null,null,"Not necessarily in the way we are playing. With two DMs, it's possible to have one sitting (Mikel) and one running (Ramires). While Mikel is being given a more free role going forward this year (he almost scored, twice!) he is still the #1 sitting DM.

He'd have to be taught not to run up headless-chicken-Gerrard-like whenever Mikel ventures forward, but beyond that I could see it working. 

My biggest worry is we don't genuinely have enough CDMs this year for those 2 positions. Only 4 players - with 1 injured (Lamps) and 1 unproven/unreliable (Romeu) - leaves a whole lot of work for Ramires and Mikel, especially considering we have an extra trip to Japan coming up. Basically, they may be playing roughly 50-60 games this season. Their form will drop eventually, even if they are two of the four fittest men on the planet (Essien + Khedira gets in as the other 2).

I have the same scare for Mata, a man who were at the Euros and the Olympics. It's vital Marin gets in there asap to alleviate some of the pressure. He out-shone even Hazard in pre-season (direct, shifty, creative, and intelligent) and if he's fit he can really contribute. Add in Moses (who Nostredamus predicts to be 2016 world player of the year) and we have a solid rotation system with different types of players (Marin is better defensively, Moses if more of a threat inside the box).",0,1352375116,null,0,false,0,c6y934e,t3_12tjp3,t1_c6y934e,t1_c6y1tns,null,1430351902,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

The London bus service can take 6.5m per day, the bikes [20 thousand](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/bike-blog/2011/jul/10/boris-bikes-hire-scheme-london). Demand is a peculiar thing, it seems to be very well off white middle-aged men, particularly in Westminster.

I'd need to see some stats on users, whether they are tourists or locals. Roads are unsafe or should I say drivers are unsafe—probably both. I have at least one near miss every time I go out, whether it is tailgating or a car overtaking with less than a 50cm gap which is totally beyond my control. Every week they'll be abuse or such a poor overtake around a blind corner that on coming traffic will have to take evasive action. Cycling deaths and injuries have actually increased recently. Boris Bikes are used 77% by males, which mirrors the general trend of cycling (youth + male + generally sporty, good coordination). You need your brave pills, because you will get flustered, you will get regular near misses and it does put the vast majority of people off. The roads aren't the place for slightly wobbly old dears or young children on a bike or those with general poorer awareness or lack of bike competency. Panicked people tend not to have the best control, and for the easily stressed it would be a nightmare. I speculate that cycling is currently considered safe-ish statistically because the lesser cyclists aren't taking part in the 8-9am commute, or the winter 5-6pm in the dark.

Also as is usually the case, infrastructure within London is far greater than outside. Cycling provision even when the authorities make some effort often encourages dangerous cycling practices, if it's there at all. Should cycling actually become popular, very quickly we'll come to realise that the road networks are far from friendly.

Then there are those who quotes the studies and stats where cycle helmets are mandatory that show the death rate is not significantly reduced. What they don't realise is it is not just about the death rate, but on reducing the significance of the head injury. Advances in medicine now mean that people who would previously have died whilst not wearing a helmet ( or wearing one) are not surviving. Many of those are left with significant brain injury after the head trauma, while the physiological injuries to the brain can be similar in people, the effects of those are incredibly varied. Its not like breaking a bone. Families of those with a brain injury have said it is like living with a different person, they look talk and walk the same, but the person they fell in love with or grew up with is gone. Yet they cannot grieve like they would have if they had died, it is an incredibly sad situation to be in,. And then of course there are the physical motor effects of a brain injury, people unable to return to a job they loved or continue with a hobby.

It works on the principle, that if you increase the amount of a currency in circulation, the purchasing power of it goes down.
 
Basically a central bank issues more bank notes and gives them to the government. The Government can then spend these bank notes, before the 'value' or 'purchasing power' of the pound is affected by the increase of currency. So they get to buy goods at pre-inflation prices, before devaluing the currency with large quantities of cash.

This has a tendency to aid people who are in debt, while punishing people who have savings. The 'real' value of someone's debts is diminished, and the 'real' value of someone's savings is eroded.

QE is best considered a 'burst of inflation' and if taken to extremes, can cause hyperinflation, like what happened in [Zimbabwe.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe)

You want me to buy Zimbabwe government bonds and I'm going to want to see one helluva an interest rate return on the bond to counterbalance the risk.  G'damn huge for Zimbabwe, which is why no-one is.   To the some, much lesser extent the same issue is what Greece and Spain faces.  Confidence is at a low so those governments to keep servicing their debt need to offer higher and higher promises of return when servicing their government debt - and they're at the point now where people are asking at what stage are they no longer to fulfil these obligations.

It's a different matter with the UK.  Cost of UK government borrowing per pound borrowed is at historic lows^[1] , an unpopular sentiment but in no small part because it has shown willing to go into austerity early and strong.  So the Bank of England saying it doesn't feel it has to buy as many government bonds from banks freeing up their liquidity is a sign that the international community is showing more signs of confidence in the UK when compared to others.  It's opposite to what we see in Greece and Spain, or to a much greater extent in Zimbabwe; there the cost of borrowing is at historic highs.

In ELI5 terms the Bank of England improves confidence by effectively betting on the itself or the UK government when confidence in it elsewhere is low; saying they'll take the bonds knowing that they can sell them later because things ARE (in their sense, 'please believe us') going to get better.  When they announce that they're no longer trying to convince people, it's because the markets are telling them that they KNOW (or think they know) that things are getting better.  It's also an early indicator that they can contemplate towards moving the interest rate up, which is good in terms of how UK budgets are affected.  Moving interest closer to real term inflation makes budget spending go further and takes pressure off the middle class and the retired.

EU and EZ forecasts this week have been downgraded and the UK is showing signs of growth in both the markets and jobs.  It makes sense that the BoE should issue a statement saying they don't feel a need to be so interventionist.

I don't understand why people keep bringing Freema and Karen up in this context.

This is different with Oswin. This is intentional and planned from the beginning. 

When Freema and Karen were originally cast for their background/minor roles, there was no official intention to use them in any other capacity. Their casting as companions later on was after-the-fact and had no intended story relation to their previous appearance. The acknowledgement of Martha Jones having a cousin was only added resolve the fact that her likeness (in this case, her exact likeness, because it's the same actress) appeared before. It was not some secret plan from the beginning to randomly have someone in an attack have a cousin that becomes a companion later on. 

We'll eventually know Clara's connection to Oswin Oswald.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Australian Sutton, 55, who is also head coach at Team Sky, was involved in an incident while cycling along the A6 in Manchester suburb Levenshulme on Thursday morning.

It seems to me we need to start thinking about increased safety regulations for cyclists that wish to use arterial routes (such as the A6).

Let's face it: we don't let cars on the road without a mechanical inspection (MOT). Nor do we let drivers on the road without a knowledge test and examination. All new cars are subject to strict safety design standards and must be registered.

Some basic design features that bicycles for public roads need:

* four wheels instead of two for stability
* indicators to assist other road users in predicting a cyclist's next move
* strong secure bars around the rider - with a softer ""crumple zone"" beyond that to absorb energy during a collision

Of course this additional weight may necessitate some form of external power source such as a petrol engine. And improvements could be made by providing protection from rain and stones flung up by heavier vehicles. Some form of rider restraint could prevent cyclists being flung out of their vehicles in certain circumstances.

Look: let's not be silly about this. Rider safety is paramount. Particularly when sharing very busy traffic routes. And we can take very practical and pragmatic steps towards this *now*.",0,1352389571,null,0,false,0,c6ybg57,t3_12uuou,t1_c6ybg57,t3_12uuou,null,1430353084,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Even though I understand that people don't like him on Reddit all that much. People also say that his skills won't work on premier league defenders. I believe his agility and speed could be used easily to beat PL defense. I would also like to see Fellaini on Manchester city. Superb holding mid in my opinion and still has plenty of years ahead of him. Good attack, and good defense. I'd also like to see some kind of Russian talent come to Manchester. Such as Zhirkov, Dzygoev, and maybe take a chance on Arshavin for team depth. Kerzhakov would be good, but I think we have enough strikers. Honda, is another choice because of his ability to create plays in Midfield. He'd be a great addition to the squad and when we decide to play Clichy in stead of Kolarov, Honda can whack those free kicks in. He's also at a good age so we wouldn't have to worry about him retiring soon. 

Edit: I'd also like to see Moritz Leitner move here, shows potential at Dortmund and would be great addition. Thiago Silva, I believe is one of the best defenders in the world but he recently moved so I wouldn't expect him. Lahm would be a great addition, though I can't see any desire from him to move here.

true,robdabank,JE,jersey,"&gt; barca can have this little punk

Why Barcelona would buy Nerman him is beyond me.

1. They have Messi as their forward. Arguably the best footballer in the world in his position right now. Just this season he's scored 19 goals in 17 appearances across all competitions. He's locked into a great contract with Barcelona until 2016 with a powerful exit clause. That and Messi is 25, it's not like he's 31 and Barcelona need to consider a younger option.

2. Barcelona isn't short on attacking options. Villa, Sanchez, Messi, Pedro, and Cuenca. Are you kidding me? Why would they shell out easily upwards of 40.000.000 € for this guy?

3. They have to wait. His contract expires in 2014 with Santos given a 2 year option on him. 2014 is still two years away. Not that I think you'll see his transfer stock go down but Barcelona has boys who want in from La Masia. I could be wrong but I feel like they might get priority.


All that being said I'm sort of indifferent towards Nerman. 

I think he could mesh well with our Brazilians, and there's no doubt he's talented. That all being said he'd cost an exorbitant amount, probably about as much as Torres all in. Two years down the road we might need someone like him, who knows? Either way, if he came to the Bridge I'd be okay with it. If Chelsea wasn't on his shortlist I wouldn't care.

Like some other people in this thread have noted I'd be more interested in another high work rate centre back, a colossal box-to-box midfielder like Yaya Toure, or another striker.

A dead branch will be colonised by other fungi which will decay the actual wood and make the branch a risk to whatever's nearby.

Same for no bicycle helmets. Maybe you'll just die, which is pretty cheap. Or maybe you need a shitload of surgery which costs a fortune. Maybe it does mean that people will cycle less and become fatter, but I'm sure that difference would be negligible. I doubt that enough people cycle that it would make any significant difference to the obesity of the country overall.

Either way, how about we agree not to have government involved in every decision we make? If you want to ride without a helmet, fine. If you want to smoke, fine.

As a good Roman Catholic boy who went to a RC school we visited Ireland and Northern Ireland many times and I've continued to visit every few years to this day.

I love Northern Ireland, its peoples and cultures. Sure, certain areas can be sketchy as hell and the country is far from over the troubles, but its improved A LOT.

The last time I was over I worked on the film Your Highness so I lived over there for a couple of months and really got to see a whole different side to the place, that previously as tourist I hadn't seen.

But yes, I feel that there's a huge disconnect between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland, though I'm not sure the Unionists would agree.

For reference, ( rather than just saying read the article) a few notes from the article:

&gt;Conclusions The wearing of bicycle helmets contributes significantly to the prevention of head injuries (HI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly in children and adolescents.





&gt;There is evidence to support the role of cycle helmets in the prevention of injuries to the middle third of the face and some dental injuries. There is a case for the implementation of legislation accompanied by educational campaigns to increase significantly the use of cycle helmets.

&gt;McDermott,12 in Australia, reported that, in a sample of 830 cyclists, the first objects struck by the face, head or helmet were the ground and then motor vehicles. The road and vehicles were also the most common objects of impact for any part of the body. This suggests that in an accident the initial collision, and thus the brunt of the impact, is often taken by the head.





&gt;How do helmets work?
When the head impacts with a hard surface as, for example in a fall from a bicycle, it decelerates rapidly. This deceleration can cause cerebral contusions as the brain hits the skull and/or diffuse axonal injuries as a result of tearing and shearing within the substance of the brain.29 These can result in temporary or permanent brain damage.

&gt;A helmet distributes the kinetic energy of the impact over a wider area and thus reduces the rate of deceleration and risk of TBI. By spreading the impact energy over a greater area, direct trauma such as skull fractures are prevented. The helmet also works by preventing penetrating injuries such as from stones.4

&gt;A Transport Research Laboratory hospital-based study1 estimated that if unhelmeted riders had been wearing helmets, 30% of the slightly injured and 11% of the seriously injured would not have been injured at all and 18% of the seriously injured would have sustained only minor injuries.





&gt;Cook and Sheikh8 reviewed the UK trends in serious head injuries (skull fractures and intracranial injuries) in cycle accidents between 1991 and 1995, a period when cycle helmet use was reportedly increasing. During this period, the total number of emergency admissions of cyclists changed very little, but the number with head injury as the primary diagnosis, fell by around 25% and there was a reduction in admission for head injury from 40% to 28% of bicycle accident cases. This reduction was evenly spread across the age groups (9% in 6–10-year-olds, 11% in 11–15-year- olds and 13% in adults; 16+).

&gt;Thompson et al.30 examined the effect of helmet wearing in 3,990 injured cyclists who were admitted to hospital during an 18-month period. Of the 14 fatalities, 13 were unhelmeted and the deaths of 11 individuals were attributed to head injury. A study in Newcastle also reported that all 33 of the child cyclist fatalities due to head injury during the course of the study were in unhelmeted cyclists.31

There is a very distinct difference between paedophilia and ephebophilia and those that blur the lines between the two worry me as much as those that distinguish them does for you. Paedophilia is a mental illness in which a person is physically attracted to pre-pubescent children. Finding girls that have matured to a point in which psychologically we're *meant* to find them attractive, attractive, regardless of age or laws, in a purely primal manner, is entirely different. 

A 40 year old man who has sex with a 14 year old (provided she's post-pubescent) is not a paedophile, and to call them as such dilutes what paedophilia actually is. We're too quick in this country to label everyone a ""pedo"" if they find anyone under the age of 18 attractive, and when you've got teenagers tarting themselves up in skimpy clothes and full on make up, you've got to distinguish between what is and what isn't paedophilia. 

Alan Clark would never have been convicted of paedophilia, because he wasn't a paedophile.

Have a look into the history. England was Protestant and Ireland was Catholic. So the English sent in troops, and basically maltreated the locals. The Pope was a threat to the English in the days of religious war, and having a few million Catholics off to the West was not pleasing to the English.

The Irish didn't take kindly to being treated like scum, and they were a bit uppity. So the British sent over some hardcore settlers from Scotland; basically giving them land and letting them run it how they wanted, as long as they remained in control. You can imagine how that worked out.

When the Irish won independence, the British split the island so that the North remained part of the UK - because that's where most of the Protestant settlers had gone.  The Protestants continued to oppress the Catholics there, and I hear there's still a lot of discrimination.

So yes, it's not *just* about religion, but that's a handy line to tell you who held the power and who was abused.  You should also note that the Scots and the Welsh also suffered at the hands of the English and were likewise invaded and oppressed.

There are plenty of people alive *now* who have a better claim to the throne than 'ol Liz. For example, the descendents of the Stuart dynasty still live in France. England kicked out the Stuarts (we got sick of them, frankly), *twice*, in the C17th, only just missed creating a republic in the process.

Or, if you want to roll back all the way to the Plantagenets, there is a family alive and well and living in Australia (they did a program about this a while back), who had a better claim to the throne than any of the Tudors due to the very probable illegitimacy of someone that was key to the Tudor claim to the throne.

Claims to the throne are 10 a penny. What you require is consent from Parliament. 

Frankly, I think the whole Royalty thing is slightly embarrassing, and I do wish we could find some way of moving toward a Republic, but we do seem to be at an impasse. ",0,1352399823,null,0,1352400381,0,c6ye95o,t3_12v31v,t1_c6ye95o,t3_12v31v,null,1430354500,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

To be fair though, he was solid at times and stopped prevented some attacks very well.

+ Cole was not bad in the first half. In the second... ... ... *sigh*

+ Shelvey was off form today, and has been for the last few games.

+ I expected better from Henderson as well. Started off the match brightly, strung a couple of good passes together in the first 10 minutes or so, but after that, he was kind of like Shelvey.

+ Compared to his usual standard, Downing was decent. Really.

+ Jones was great. I'm liking him more and more, he impressed me the moment he blocked that volley from Eto'o in the first half. Would have had a perfect (?) game if he didn't concede that goal.

+ Suso was really good. That shot on goal which he took after beating one or two players was fantastic, shame it got saved. Also made good runs and passes.

Its because the differences have roots in, relatively recent, material inequalities and discrimination against Catholics.

Its not the religious divide itself or the history of religious conflict (that exists in many other countries) but the persistence of inequalities and discrimination based on that divide well into the 20th century.

there will always be dirty old pervs in the world but the laws that be in our country have deemed 16 to be the age where a minor becomes responsible for their own actions, in the past there was a difference in age for the hetro/homo loving

i dont know any of the FACTS, this is all based on ASSUMPTION but in the past:

- you have a straight man who sleeps with a 17 year old girl, she is over the age limit and thus ayyy-ok
- you have a gay man who sleeps with a 17 year old boy, he is under the age limit and thus his partner is a pedophile

true,myimportantthoughts,cnty-uk,It's grim up North London,"I don't know about Oxford but I can tell you a bit about LSE Economics from first hand experience, which must surely be similar. (I took an economics module but my degree is not in pure economics)

In the first year (undergrad) economics/business/finance students all take 1 module in economics which is the standard LSE introduction to economics. The economics course is only 1/4 of the first year *even for people doing Bsc economics*. The rest is maths (1/2 of year 1) and a accounting/business module.

There are a couple of key texts for this: 'Macroeconomics' by G.Mankiw and 'Microeconomics and Behavior' Frank. You could certainly read these yourself (as a layman) but to answer the questions and understand the advanced bits you will certainly need to be good at maths.

What a non economics specialist might find very surprising is how mathematical it is (at LSE at least). You need A-level maths and further maths to get in (for economics), with an A* in maths as a minimum. The economics books and problems are mostly mathematical, concerning the formulas for demand / supply / taxation. There is some essay writing but maths is certainly the majority. And students are not reading Adam smith, they are reading textbooks (mostly).

As for native vs. web apps? I guess there are a few points (my own, not my employer's):
1) Web app performance is still shoddy compared to native
2) This app uses some functionality that isn't/wasn't available to web apps (for example, I believe file upload was added in iOS6, but that absolutely predates development).
3) App stores for each platform offer an opportunity for promotion that's hard to match with a web app.
4) Native app stores are well suited for purchasing an app. As a web app it's possible to enable the app to be purchased, but almost impossible to do so with a conversion rate approaching that of a native app.",0,1352409798,null,0,false,0,c6yh4pk,t3_12vcr2,t1_c6yh4pk,t1_c6yge1t,null,1430355758,1,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,1

&gt;I wouldn't be surprised, since I'm a big fan of Adam Smith. I view him as a proto-socialist of sorts who didn't quite make the necessary connections. I have little argument with his basic economics, though they've been usefully updated by many people, Ricardo and Marx obviously, but many others since.

Smith was certainly on the side of the poor, not the rich. His entire system is supposed to bring ""Universal Opulence"". His famous ""invisible hand"" is supposed to be the method which redistributes wealth to the poor via rich people spending money on things that they want (like big houses, etc.).

Ricardo is on the other end of the scale (or so I've heard, I believe he teamed up with Malthus? I have his book but haven't read it yet. Read the first part of Malthus and it was pretty disgusting), regarding the poor as parasites who have to be made to work harder or starved out.

----
&gt;I don't think we're greatly opposed here. 

I suspect we both perceive the same problems and want to tackle them in different ways...

----
&gt;There's nothing that makes me more pissed off than middle class lefties talking about the need for touchy feelie rehab and leaving working class people to live on shitty estates with genuine crime. You know, where people actually get robbed and hurt. Yes, genuine restructuring of society is the only way to make property crime pointless, but that's not very helpful to a person with a shop on a shitty estate. But you can sell ""leftie"" progressive law and order polices just by showing they're cheaper and actually fucking work, whereas no ""rightie"" one I'm aware of does...

There will be property crime as long as there are people with no morals. Even if everyone has equal property some bastard will decide he wants more than other people and won't be afraid to take it from them. I very much doubt that many crimes are committed from actual need, but rather jealousy, want and a lack of sympathy for others. I have been a victim of serious crime this year, and it was nothing to do with trying to take something from me as far as I can tell, merely a bastard who wanted to take my classic car for a joyride. He couldn't, and torched it. That wasn't about property in the direct sense; he would have known he wouldn't have been able to keep the car, he just wanted fun and didn't care at whose expense.

----
&gt;I'm not against the concept of law, only the administration of justice. Personally, I'd go for juror only courts for most cases (with legal advisors), and juror courts supported by expert helpers as well as legal advisors in certain cases requiring technical knowledge.

The problem is that jurors are often worse than judges, I've heard through friends of juries deciding to find somebody innocent just because they wanted to go home! Nobody has any sense of civic duty any more...

I think a lot of the problems are in the Justice system. As mentioned I don't think Justice is applied equally: It should be the hammer used on behalf of *everybody* to keep those without a moral code from hurting the rest of us, be that physically, financially or whatever. Unfortunately it's mostly used by the rich as a manner to keep the rest of us in line. Especially when it comes to democratic protests in London... Again it's Smith who regards the ""exact administration of Justice"" for the good of everybody to be one of the 3 primary duties of the state.

----
&gt;I'm assuming, I think with some justice, that racism is a feature if not a product of capitalism (and/or other exploitative economic systems - like feudalism, slavery, etc.). If you're brought up in economic democracy, the tendency to blame other races or to believe you have some special racial status largely goes away.

I don't think racism is necessarily based on perceived injustice. I think you're right that it *can* be, for example, antisemitism in Europe probably got a lot of mileage out of the perception that Jews were all wealthy bankers/merchants etc. However, it think that it can just be based on tradition - i.e. if you're brought up being told black people are inferior and you never come into contact with one, you'll probably believe it and maintain the belief and pass it on to your descendants.

&gt;This has become the neo-classical myth, can you justify it in any way? None of the intelligent analyses of the crisis I've seen say irresponsible lending was at the heart of it. Have you seen Inside Job? Most independent analysts, including most people in the banking industry not directly implicated, seem to point to this as the best attempt at an explanation. And it directly points fingers for fraud and certainly never blames borrowers...

I'm going on what Robert Peston has had to say, here's a decent audio-slide show going through borrowing, the housing crisis, etc.: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7688308.stm

I probably should have said ""borrowing"" rather than ""lending"" but then again, it takes two to tango - on one side you have people and nations borrowing beyond their means, on the other side you have bankers happily lending to them, then bundling together ""toxic debt"" with AAA debt and selling off the bundles of debt as being much more sound than they were. That is what I have seen termed ""irresponsible lending"", as they were actively hiding bad debt with good debt.

I haven't seen Inside Job, I just had a look at IMDB. It looks a little like it might be trying to take a complex situation and blame it on a few individuals (which is always an easy way out), but that's just a very slight worry. I'll order it in as I'm very interested in all this.

&gt;On the other hand, if your house was burgled, you might do better than to go to the person who stole from you to decide what alarms to install...

They aren't all on the same side. The Chicago School who have been in vogue until recently are only one branch of economic thought. As an example, a separate and promising branch is Behavioral Economics. You also have interesting groups like [The New Economics Foundation](http://www.neweconomics.org/) who have some interesting publications up.

&gt; Economic migration is a result of globalisation and corporate capitalism. Without it, people would change country for more personally relevant reasons and because they identified with the place they moved to. Worker-owned enterprises don't shut themselves down and outsource overseas, that's what capitalist businesses do.

Remember that Capitalism doesn't preclude worker owned businesses (see for example, John Lewis, the Co-op, etc.) nor does it institutionally encourage economic migration. I agree that economic migration is presently the result, but I think that we have to look at the telos of Capitalism.
 
Strip Capitalism back to its basic premises, and it's about individuals bringing their capital into fair and free competition with each other for the sake of obtaining wealth. How that wealth is obtained is dependent on the consumers in the market place and the investors who have provided capital for that firm. Therefore, what you get out is what you put in - if investors cared about more than sheer profit, they might find moral reasons not to out source (or they might take the long view that out sourcing to India or wherever is actually moral because it redistributes our wealth...). If the consumers cared enough, they would take issue with the outsourcing and switch companies, thereby hurting that company's bottom line and discouraging further outsourcing. But consumers are too selfish and want things cheaply, and investors only care about growth, the result being that the company can obtain wealth by sending jobs overseas.

Taken from this view, economic migration is a result of *the attitudes of the people*; it is *not* an inherent result of Capitalism.

Of course, the pendulum is swinging the other way, I've seen talk in business columns of companies on-shoring their call centres again because their customers are not happy with the poor service they're getting, etc.. In other words, they've found that wealth lays in the other direction, so the tide reverses.

true,agoMiST,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"My best friend's a chef and from the tales he's told me it seems chefs are, for the most part, an arrogant bunch. It seems to be the nature of the kitchen, it's a **very** alpha environment and can be extremely confrontational. There also seems to be a huge stigma for perfectionism.

The crux of the issue here appears to be that the chef asked the critic if his meal was ok, and the critic affirmed it was. Now, the article writer is excusing this as not rocking the boat however, given past experience with my chef friend, it's the wrong option especially for a critic. 

If I'm out for a meal with my friend and there's anything wrong he lets the staff know, at first I was uncomfortable but I've picked this habit up; if you're pleasant about anything that's wrong it will more often than not be sorted as soon as possible or accommodations will be made to appease whatever is at fault. 

My friend does this because it's what he would want people to do to him, he wants to be 100% perfect 100% of the time and sometimes you need to be told where you've gone wrong.

Back to the article, if the critic had spoken up about what was wrong with his meal the chef would have done his damnedest to correct it which should have then lead to a more favourable review... which is why the chef has blown his top on twitter; now I'm not saying he was within his rights to be so abusive but the combination of the alpha confrontational perfectionist type combined with being deprived a chance to fix what was wrong because the critic kept quiet, explains the outburst.

As for other chefs joining in, that was completely unnecessary but that's a standard human mob mentality response, like kids circling a scrap in a playground and chanting ""fight, fight""

What really irritates me about the article is the author, he himself is a chef, he should know this mentality and even if he doesn't condone it he should at least understand it.

Some far-left groups exist within the labour party to push campaigns under the banner of the ""labour representation committee"". These include the Socialist Party (formerly militant tendency) and Alliance Workers Liberty. In terms of a modern electoral left this is as good as there is really. 

Even in big cities there is little electoral option on the left. Some areas (seems to be fairly randomly distributed) have Trade Union Socialist Coalition candidates, but they are very poorly organised IMO.

Due to the electoral system most left groups are like the SWP and largely reject working towards getting councillors or MPs elected. Its interesting to note that Galloway consistently proves this pessimism wrong. Don't get me wrong, his politics are terrible, but his continued successes really do point to possible way forward for some future left grouping.

There's the potential to stay within the free trade area, but unless we can negotiate a new form of agreement, this would mean retaining much of Brussels instituted law and regulations. 

If we left the free trade area, something like 90% of our trade is still covered by WTO rules, which means they can't impose tariffs, and the vast amount of our trade should continue unaffected.

Financially, in terms of contributions &amp; subsidies, we would be better off outside the EU. The net economic benefits however would depend on the effect on trade and regulation. I've heard it said that the cost of EU regulation for British businesses dwarfs our financial contributions.

Diplomatically, I hope that given the right tone and co-operation from us, a Britain that's leaving the EU and not blocking integration among EU members will be more warmly received than we are presently.

On the other hand, the existence of a European nation the size of Britain existing outside the EU does call into question it's purpose and assumptions made about it's importance.

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"They were formed from the union of two former Parties in 1988.The first of these Parties were the Liberals; which had grown out of the Whig Party in 1859 and which was the main opposition against the Conservative Party until the Labour Party, which had been founded in 1900, starting overtaking them in elections in the 1920s. The second Party was the Social Democratic Party, which was a break away group from the Labour Party who felt that Labour were being pulled too far to left and who saw themselves as more moderate. 

The Liberal Party had originally been based around Laissez-Faire economic Liberalism and defence of personal liberty and also for reducing the powers of the Crown and the Church of England. During the late 19th and 20th centuries though they shifted to Social Liberalism, which emphasises and encourages the role of the State in addressing economic and social issues and more vigorously promotes the collective rights of communities as well as the rights of individuals. 

In the late 1980s it made sense for these two Parties, who shared a good deal of common ground, to join forces in order to be a greater electoral force. Since then they've been the main third Party of British politics. 

There have always been internal divisions within the Party, the former Liberal wing, sometimes referred to as 'orange bookers' still believes in the ability of free markets and private enterprise to operate public services and manage the economy more so than the former Social Democrats who are still wedded to old Labour values such as Unionism and Nationalisation of services. 

Added to this they are also the main magnet on the centre and centre left for voters not wishing to vote for Labour or the Conservatives and for those wishing to register a protest vote who don't want to 'waste' it on too small a Party. So they attract people who'd vote Green but don't think that Party is well organised, people who'd vote Conservative but don't like their Euro-scepticism and so on. 

Right now they are in Government in a coalition with the Conservatives. This is because in our last General Election no Party won an outright majority. So the Lib-Dems as the third biggest Party were the 'king makers' since whoever they agreed to go in to coalition with would get the ruling majority. 

Labour, who were the first choice of much of the Lib-Dem membership, if not of their leadership (allegedly) abandoned coalition talks since to obtain a majority they would have needed to also court the Scottish and Welsh National Parties and possibly would have had to concede some sovereignty to them as part of the deal. The other (alleged) story is that the Lib-Dems never courted Labour with any ardour because they believed that since the Conservatives got the most seats it was more democratic to side with them.

The Lib-Dems and the Conservatives now have an uneasy alliance, there is enough overlap between the Parties that they can govern together after a fashion, but there is also bitter rancour and outright loathing between them. 

As of now the Lib-Dems have fallen from favour with much of their voter base because many of the policies they have helped the Conservatives push through displeases big parts of it. Examples are more private sector involvement in the NHS and reduced welfare benefits.

How would you describe a stereotypical liberal-democrat supporter? 

Does an admin job for the local Council or is a humanities teacher, wears sandals in the summer and regularly eats vegan food even if he's not a vegetarian, finds trade unions a bit Marxist for his tastes but joins one anyway because it organises day trips to the local train Museum. Is really vocally in favour of proportional representation or alternative vote and scrapping the Trident nuclear weapons, drinks real Ale.

I think you have a problem in that Economic Liberalism is a much broader term in the United Kingdom than how it is used in Europe and the United States. Like all political and social terms, they are subjective.

The Liberal Democrats are generally thought of to be middle, while the Conservatives are Middle-Right (or -traditionally- Right) and Labour are Middle-Left (or -traditionally- Left). Of course this may be meaningless without understanding political culture in the United Kingdom.

It is also important to remember that 'New Labour' is gone and it is now just 'Labour' again.

true,ben9345,english,London,"They used to be the Liberal Party and were opposed to the Conservatives during the 1800s but politics at the time was aristocratic and about as right wing as you can get so they would be considered very right wing now.  In the early 1900s the Labour Party was formed and that party allied itself with 'the working man' and established close links with trade unions. It became the true left wing party that the Liberals had never been. As a result they were stuck in the middle and Labour became the predominant party on the liberal side and the Liberal Party became centrist. In 1981 they allied with the Social Democrats who were another socially liberal centrist party and in 1988 the parties merged and became the Liberal Democrats. Neither party could get enough votes to challenge Labour or the Conservatives so they thought together they would be more forceful given they agreed on so much. Right now they are socially liberal and left wing but lack the union links of the labour party so they attract white collar liberals and people who don't feel connected enough to labour unions to vote labour but are still left wing. They are environmentalists, pro-EU, pro-wealth taxation, big supporters of electoral reform and in favour of gay marriage, abortion rights etc. 

I would not describe them as libertarians. They are in favour of publicly funded health care, taxing the rich and were aiming to keep tuition fees from going up and keeping them more publicly funded than they currently are. Unfortunately the coalition agreement meant that the conservatives could push for a rise in tuition fees and the Lib Dems had to support it meaning they now have a reputation for being spineless and unprincipled. I wouldn't say its a stigma to vote lib dem as long as you have you reasons for doing so I reckon people will listen to you but for the reason above it might raise an eyebrow or a disappointed look at least for the next election cycle. It certainly was not a stigma before 2010 and the coalition. 

They are frequently talked about as 'the 3rd party' preventing us from being a 2 party system. People like the idea of having many parties in elections as it make our democracy healthier so people support the idea of 'the 3rd party' if only to make our democracy look better. For many people this in the niche they fill but they do have a firm ground of at least 10% support I most elections. Its rare they fall below it. Now is one of those times because of the backlash from raising tuition fees but I am sure it will rise above 10% by 2015 if not 2020. However that's a long wait while people become more persuaded by the right wing sections of the media that they don't like the EU and therefore they vote for the UK Independence Party who basically run on the one issue of leaving the EU. People have mentioned that they could become the new 3rd party so we'll see if the Lib Dems recover in time to see of a challenge from UKIP.

true,notlostyet,null,null,"&gt; What ideological niche do they fill? 

Socially: far left, highly liberal. Pretty much everything else: stubbornly centre ground.

In American political terms they're probably far left Democrat.

&gt; Are they somewhat similar to American style libertarians? 

No. Libertarians sit on the right of the political spectrum and favour smaller government, lower public spending and less state interference and regulation. The Lib Dems sit on the left and, although they are pretty fiscally conservative, they can, like Labour, be much more centre ground when it comes to programmes that Americans would consider leaning toward outright socialism or coming from big government.

Also, Libertarians in the US tend to be allied with the more conservative pack (the Republicans) on social policy, or perhaps don't pursue social issues at all, seeing it as a problem for the individual state. The Lib Dems are socially highly liberal and push that ideal from the center.

There are some similarities though. Politically they *do* favour a smaller parliament (fewer MPs) and much more independent local governance....but there are some strong purely idealogical strict democratic agendas as well. They want a purely proportional voting system (rejected by the electorate by referendum) and complete reform of the upper house (which is currently unelected). 

A good example of a economic policy they support that is about as far away from Libertarianism as you can get  is that of the [Mansion Tax, which they support](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/liberaldemocrats/9565283/Lib-Dems-demand-2m-mansion-tax-for-the-stinking-rich.html).

The closest thing we have to those taking a strongly Libertarian economic policy in the UK is the Conservative Party, who were responsible for selling off many public utilities and assets to the private sector in the 1980s (like British Telecom, electricity, coal, and gas.).

&gt; How are lib-dems stigmatized culturally? 

England (not Scotland so much) is culturally cynical, self-deprecating and conservative. It is, however, a socially liberal place (hard fought over several decades)... so the Lib Dems strong support for personal liberties, LGBT rights, abortion, and assisted suicide tend to go down pretty well.

On the other hand, their green policies and their stance on defense on immigration tends to be met with ridicule. Their pro-European stance (they're still in favour of one day joining the €), their proposal for a one-off amnesty for illegal immigrants, and the idea of scrapping the UKs aging nuclear arsenal (a multi-billion $ submarine  system called 'Tridant') arguably cost them dearly in the 2010 election. Hopefully from these 3 policies alone you can see they are pretty far away from the US Republican party.

As of late they're also seen as flip-floppers, and yellow and spineless for going in to coalition with the Tories.

They will want to protect their internal market first before letting us get a sniff. Forcing ourselves out of a trading pact that has served us extremely well is the single most stupid idea that has come from politicians in this country. There is simply no benefit in doing so.

true,ben9345,english,London,"Of the things we will lose from leaving the EU the trade crap is the least important. We could remain in a free trade zone but it would cost us money. What matters to you as a human being is that a whole range of consumer protections and LGBT and gender equality rules and environmental rule will be rolled back because a lot of it is contained in the case law of the European Court of Justice. They might decide to try and keep it but it would have to be transferred into UK law as far as i'm aware which is unlikely to happen because its these types of laws and rules that normal people enjoy immensely but the Daily Mail see's as meddling Brussels bureaucrats blah blah fucking blah. 

This is not to mention the fact that you would no longer be able to freely travel around Europe and you would have to buy a visa each time you want to travel in Europe which means travelling in Europe for students will be come much more expensive and less safe because there will be no co-operation on crime and justice meaning your case is much more likely to not be solved. As it is you can go into any EU nations embassy and you will be given the same treatment and help as you would in the UK embassy if the UK does not have an embassy where you are. Nor will you be able to live and work without prejudice in the EU any more. You can be refused for a job purely because of your nationality. As of now that is illegal in the EU. 

European students will stop coming to the UK because we will now be able to charge them the price for foreign students which is tens of thousand of pounds which would put them of entirely when the cost in their own country is only a few thousand. That will mean the clever people of Europe won't get degrees from the UK and get UK jobs but will stay in the Eu where we won't be and that will probably have a massive effect on our economy both while those students are not spending money here but also later as we lose highly skilled workers from the EU due to the barrier of working outside the EU for them. But i'm sure our relationship with America is sufficient instead. UKIP seem to think so despite the fact that Germany and Britain now send fewer students to America than do Nepal or Vietnam and we travel much much more extensively in Europe for the Alps and Spanish beaches etc. But yeah, i'm sure we can trust UKIP on that one. India will definitely suffice for France. They're basically interchangeable right?
/s

Sarcasm aside you'll have to get someone else to tell you the positive to leaving the EU because i'm struggling here.

The two that Netflix has are extremely important to the series at that point. Planet of the Dead is not important, but you may choose to track it down and watch yourself.

2. There is a special between Seasons 5 and 6 that Netflix doesn't have called A Christmas Carol that I actually haven't even seen yet either, but it's out there.

true,judgewooden,eng-GreaterLondon,The Dutch,"Here is a theory: Its about the future of London.

London's is one of the easiest places to operate as a financial operator. The FSA is responsible for maintaining market confidence, promoting public understanding of the financial system, provide the appropriate degree of protection of consumers and fighting financial crime. The 2009 Lord Turner report broadly acknowledged that the FSA failed and proposed cross border regulation to be developed for banks. The British government said, in the wake of the credit crisis, that they will follow Lord Turner recommendation.

There will be a point, in the not to distant future, where cross border regulation will be developed that is to London's disadvantage. Since the regulation is designed using a co-decision procedure of regulators and then adopted by the European Commission / Parliament, there is no legal way for the UK government to influence it and can only resort to politics where they have no majority. 

Financial Operators will love it if the FSA could continue its 'light touch' approach. Having the option to not adopt EU regulation is why Cameron is playing this 'leaving the EU' game.

Politicians can not be seen to 'protect' bankers so they need to save the city of London undercover - if Cameron pulls this off he will be well rewarded.

EDIT: 'light touch' not my words - Lord Turners.

After half time we moved to a back three and put Dietmar Hamann on. From then on we were playing three against two in our defence and we controlled Kaká by playing Xabi Alonso and Hamann infront of our defence. We moved Steven Gerrard and Luis Garcia to play on both sides of Andrea Pirlo. In possesion our centre backs had to be wide, and we got space in wide areas by switching the ball quickly.

Just tossing in my two cents, but while I agree with the first part of that sentence, I completely disagree with the second part. I think the RTD era was much more closed off from the classic era, and was much more self contained within itself. I find that the Moffat era has opened up a lot more, and brings in much more references to the old days of Doctor Who. Hell, I still find classic references with Eleven that I missed the first dozen times I watched an episode. My favorite one to point out that I noticed just a few months ago, despite watching the episode more times than I can count, was in The Eleventh Hour. It's super subtle, but while The Doctor is having his cravings, Amelia asks him if he'd like some carrots. The Doctor gives some kind of response like 'Carrots?

true,gooneruk,cnty-england,London,"&gt;They want a purely proportional voting system (rejected by the electorate by referendum)

_Technically_, the public rejected the Alternative Vote system, rather than straight PR. The Lib Dems thought that moving to PR in one step would be too great a change, so went for AV as an in-between. Unfortunately, their coalition partners gleefully campaigned against even this change, which means that electoral change is off the agenda for probably another decade at least. A massive opportunity lost.

&gt;On the other hand, their green policies and their stance on defense on immigration tends to be met with ridicule.

I'm not so sure about this. The Lib Dems tend to be a bit ahead of the times on a number of policies. Take environmentalism, for example. They were into that way before Cameron's rebranding of the Tories as ""green"", and it's clear that the Tories' take on it was pretty cynical electioneering, as the policy has been pretty much abandoned since taking office. To be fair to the Lib Dems, they still hold true to it.

&gt;Their pro-European stance [and other policies] arguably cost them dearly in the 2010 election.

Again, whilst I agree that Britain has become more and more euro-sceptic, these kind of policies do attract voters, myself included. The percentage of the electorate voting Lib Dem has gone up in every election since 1997, in total from 16.8% to 23.0%. Unfortunately, the vagaries of FPTP meant that despite a rise in vote from 22.0% to 23.0% from 2005 to 2010, the Lib Dems actually _lost_ 5 seats.

And when you say that the above list of policies ""cost them dearly"" in 2010, they actually had their biggest share of the vote since 1987. Possibly there were some missed opportunities and they could have done better, true, but their performance shouldn't be pooh-poohed.

&gt;As of late they're also seen as flip-floppers, and yellow and spineless for going in to coalition with the Tories.

I'm in full agreement with this. The coalition has not been kind to them, despite it being their first taste of power in decades. It could quite easily be viewed as a deal with the devil, and it does threaten their 2015 electoral performance. Many voters are aghast at how quickly certain central policies have been abandoned, after years of putting them at the forefront of their manifestos. Yes, certain sacrifices have to be made in a coalition, but for many Lib Dem voters it seems that they are giving a lot of ground whilst the Tories are not.",0,1352452672,null,0,false,0,c6yqfwp,t3_12w5p0,t1_c6yqfwp,t1_c6ymwpb,null,1430360281,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

true,myimportantthoughts,cnty-uk,It's grim up North London,"Why these texts? I do not know. Yes, all texts will be biased / subjective, but this just means one must be aware of the different points of view, like if you read Marx. Microeconomics is probably less biased, and I would suggest starting with this. The best way to combat any bias (in my opinion) would be to read a lot of different sorts of books. For example, Dan Ariely writes about behavioural economics and believes that humans are consistently and predictably irrational, making all sorts of mistakes and biases. This is rejected by other schools of economics.

I would plunge straight in with Microeconomics and behaviour, but remember that it is a textbook, not prose. It is hard work in places. If there are areas with complex maths you can always skip those ( which I sometimes have to). I was not trying to exclude less mathematical people, simply to prevent anyone getting into a subject that isn't quite what they thought it was. I would also reccomend books by Dan Ariely on behavioural economics, which are good fun and very readable. 

Another area that I would reccomend is finance. Economists are hard to evaluate, anyone can make up a theory and fuzz the data to make it stick. The stockmarket is different as winners are obvious, so people like George Soros, Micheal Burry and Warren Buffet are (in my opinion) clearly worth listening to.

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","There was a point where EE's ""brand experts"" were talking about keeping Orange and T-Mobile; Orange would become the premium brand (higher quality service, more expensive for single users, only brand that offers shared plans for business), and T-Mobile would become the cheap and cheerful brand (pay to call customer service or free by e-mail/website, cheaper for single users, no shared plans).

So, Orange would be the brand that offered you things like ""up to 5 phones sharing 5,000 minutes, 50GB data, 10,000 SMS for £100/month plus £5/phone"". T-Mobile would be the brand offering ""unlimited calls, data and SMS for £25/month"". Orange users would get priority for data when a cell is congested - so when a T-Mobile user is struggling to get 1MBit/s, an Orange user in the same location might be happily getting 8MBit/s.

It made sense as a plan - Orange would cost more unless you're pulling in large numbers of phones (i.e. cheaper for corporate users), and would be consistently good service for its users. T-Mobile would be cheaper, but would sometimes have issues that Orange users didn't see. Both would share the EE network, but initially, only Orange customers would be provisioned for LTE (pay more, get better service applies - in this case, access to the LTE network in places where it exists).",0,1352455957,null,0,false,0,c6yqqlc,t3_12w4ah,t1_c6yqqlc,t1_c6yq7xc,null,1430360424,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7
true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Ironically pretty much every implementation of socialism has led to less liberty and less individual freedom, so it's not surprising that the word 'libertarianism' has been usurped.

Whilst I don't accept your assertion (and I'd want you to consider both the many anti-capitalist, workers' rights, anti-colonialist, neutralist, and liberationist movements globally and their contributions to wider freedom, and the important questions of freedom for whom and to do what, which purely celebratory capitalists have tended to ignore); it's certainly true that the fundamental schism early in the modern left's history into libertarian and State socialism, resulted in the ascendancy and dominance of the latter.

&gt;Interestingly modern-day libertarianism has independant roots in the United Kingdom, with Richard Cobden, John Bright, the Manchester School and the Anti-Corn Law League of the 19th Century.

It is interesting that you've gone for Manchesterism, as the American individualist anarchist, self-avowed libertarian socialist (and one of my leading lights) Benjamin Tucker was accused of being a consistent Manchester man and wore it as a badge of pride.  Our problem with the classical liberalism and free market preachings of Adam Smith and later the Manchester men is not that they are wrong, but that they are inconsistent and fearful of where their analysis takes them - i.e. to socialism.  

As Tucker per Ernest Lesigne quotes in his essay [State Socialism and Anarchism](http://praxeology.net/BT-SSA.htm):

    
         “There are two Socialisms.
        One is communistic, the other solidaritarian.
        One is dictatorial, the other libertarian.
        One is metaphysical, the other positive.
        One is dogmatic, the other scientific.
        One is emotional, the other reflective.
        One is destructive, the other constructive.
        Both are in pursuit of the greatest possible welfare for all.
        One aims to establish happiness for all, the other to enable each to be happy in his own way.
        The first regards the State as a society sui generis, of an especial essence, the product of a sort of divine right outside of and above all society, with special rights and able to exact special obediences; the second considers the State as an association like any other, generally managed worse than others.
        The first proclaims the sovereignty of the State, the second recognizes no sort of sovereign.
        One wishes all monopolies to be held by the State; the other wishes the abolition of all monopolies.
        One wishes the governed class to become the governing class; the other wishes the disappearance of classes.
        Both declare that the existing state of things cannot last.
        The first considers revolutions as the indispensable agent of evolutions; the second teaches that repression alone turns evolutions into revolution.
        The first has faith in a cataclysm.
        The second knows that social progress will result from the free play of individual efforts.
        Both understand that we are entering upon a new historic phase.
        One wishes that there should be none but proletaires.
        The other wishes that there should be no more proletaires.
        The first wishes to take everything away from everybody.
        The second wishes to leave each in possession of its own.
        The one wishes to expropriate everybody.
        The other wishes everybody to be a proprietor.
        The first says: ‘Do as the government wishes.’
        The second says: ‘Do as you wish yourself.’
        The former threatens with despotism.
        The latter promises liberty.
        The former makes the citizen the subject of the State.
        The latter makes the State the employee of the citizen.
        One proclaims that labor pains will be necessary to the birth of a new world.
        The other declares that real progress will not cause suffering to any one.
        The first has confidence in social war.
        The other believes only in the works of peace.
        One aspires to command, to regulate, to legislate.
        The other wishes to attain the minimum of command, of regulation, of legislation.
        One would be followed by the most atrocious of reactions.
        The other opens unlimited horizons to progress.
        The first will fail; the other will succeed.
        Both desire equality.
        One by lowering heads that are too high.
        The other by raising heads that are too low.
        One sees equality under a common yoke.
        The other will secure equality in complete liberty.
        One is intolerant, the other tolerant.
        One frightens, the other reassures.
        The first wishes to instruct everybody.
        The second wishes to enable everybody to instruct himself.
        The first wishes to support everybody.
        The second wishes to enable everybody to support himself.
        One says:
        The land to the State.
        The mine to the State.
        The tool to the State.
        The product to the State.
        The other says:
        The land to the cultivator.
        The mine to the miner.
        The tool to the laborer.
        The product to the producer.
        There are only these two Socialisms.
        One is the infancy of Socialism; the other is its manhood.
        One is already the past; the other is the future.
        One will give place to the other. 
    
        Today each of us must choose for the one or the other of these two Socialisms, or else confess that he is not a Socialist.”        ",0,1352455964,null,0,false,0,c6yqqm5,t3_12w5p0,t1_c6yqqm5,t1_c6yqje1,null,1430360424,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

true,Hiding_behind_you,yorkshire,From Essex to Yorkshire,"Cars are most definitely more dangerous than bicycles, yes, but I would suggest that cycling is, of itself, not dangerous - what makes it dangerous is the multi-ton vehicles that cyclists have to deal with, forced as they are into sharing the same road space.

But I would suggest that wearing a cycle helmet should be considered to be the equivalent of wearing a seatbelt in a car - we don't wear it to become immortal to every incident and accident, but to mitigate the consequences of 'normal' accidents.  And I would hope that, even without the statistics at hand, we would agree that wearing a car seatbelt has dramatically reduced the number of casualties and fatalities in motor vehicles.

So, perhaps the question isn't so much, ""Does wearing a helmet give *the impression* that cycling is dangerous?"", but more ""Driving a car and riding a bike **is** dangerous, but what are you, as the driver or rider, going to do about that?""

Now, working on the idea that it is impractical and unworkable to have ""Riding licences"" in the same way as we have Driving Licences, perhaps the solution is to make cycling safer by creating better cycle paths and riding lanes.  Encourage people to use them, and demonstrate that cyclists are being given the same respect as drivers.  But also encourage the use of cycle helmets if for no other reason than accidents happen, but while arm and leg bones heal comparatively quickly, brain injuries are life-changing and potentially fatal.

Firstly as to expense - having a Head of State involves costs. If we had an elected Head of State it would be expensive, the elections themselves, the necessary security, the state visits, the overseas promotion - no Head of State comes for free.

Then there's the question of whether the Royal family actually contributes more financially than it takes. This is a complicated argument and involves two seperate issues. One is the status of the Crown Estates,  - which do contribute financially - and what would / should happen to them if the role of the Monarchy was abolished.

Then there's the impact they have on tourism and the image of the UK abroad - this is pretty much unquantifiable, but is generally felt to be a positive.

There is a disconnect within the United Kingdom, particularly between Northern Ireland and England. It exists, in my opinion, between Scotland and England as well. The two nations are different. The Irish and Scots seem to have more in common with each other than either do with England when it comes to things like sense of humour, temperament, social manner and so on. Sense of humour might seem a peculiar metric to use, but along with language and accents these appear, to me at least, to be the subtleties that link people more than any highly strung political issue.

Northern Ireland will feel slightly foreign to a lot of English people because the sea divide means it's somewhere most have never visited. Add to that the news coverage surrounding Northern Ireland is mostly to do with, what the English view as, an old and very Irish conflict, I can see how it would be hard for both sides to feel affinity with one another.

Traditionally men were given various titles, for example 'Duke'. That title would then extend to his wife (Duchess) but it wasn't *her* title. She gets it through marriage. This extends all the way up and includes the Queen. You are either the owner of the title or you are granted the title by marriage. 

Queen is Elizabeth's title, she inherited it from her father (King George VI) when he died. King/Queen is same title obviously, just gender specific. 

Phillip (Queen's husband) is technically a King *Consort*, he's the husband of the Queen. He is not **The** King (Sovereign). When Elizabeth became Queen she chose to not have Phillip referred to as King Phillip, primarily because even though it's the same title King tends to sound like a higher position than Queen. 

So Phillip became Prince Phillip. 

When she dies her son will become King (Sovereign) Charles. His wife, Camilla, will become Queen (Consort) Camilla.

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle," Some people think a homosexual is more likely to be a paedophile since they regard them as already predisposed to sexual deviance. (This is complete tosh but plenty of people still believe it.) 

Savile has been named as a paedophile for years on certain on-line conspiracy blogs, these blogs are written by people distrustful of power who will repeat every rumour they hear. Hence these blogs were right about him (in general if not in every detail - we'll see - ) but the main ones Angrifaan and David Icke's blog, also believe in 'the Jewish conspiracy' and 'the homosexual conspiracy' (Seriously if you read their Savile stuff you find sentences like 'Savile was known to associate with homosexuals and Jews') Now some people think that because Icke and Angrifaan were on the money with Savile they must be right in every detail. I've even seen them cited as a reliable source here, which is crazy, to think that you also have to think the Queen is a lizard (Icke's most infamous belief) 


The law of consent around male homosexual sex has changed a lot in the last few decades, it's gone from a 21 year age limit to a 16 year age limit since the 1970s. Hence there are men around now who were having consensual sex with a 20 year old in the 1970s who were put on the sexual offences register at the time, but we now wouldn't consider that a sexual offence.

I suggest that there is a high chance you would have: therefore, we can say that a helmet can, in many examples like your own, mitigate the severity of injury.

In a higher speed, more severe incident, you might not have been so fortunate.  But in the same way the safety systems in modern cars, airbags and rigid roll cages, etc, cannot prevent all deaths from all impacts.  It's a question of how many urban-road, relatively low-speed fatalities can be avoided by cyclists wearing a helmet, as well as high-visibility clothing at night, as well as good rear- and front-facing lights.

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; With regards to that bloodline....is Queen Elizabeth a direct descendant of King Henry VIII?

Uhh sort of. You've picked the exact time it gets really quite messy. 

Henry VIII had 4 children, three of them took the throne (Mary I, Elizabeth I &amp; Edward VI) but none of them had any children and the remaining one became the King of Spain (Phillip II).

So they went back up the tree to Henry VIII siblings, to Margaret Tudor. She was married to James IV of Scotland, they had James V of Scotland, who then had James I of England/James VI of Scotland (same person, he was king of both countries, but Scotland had kings called james before him and England hadn't)

He had Charles I, who had James II and Charles II (Brothers, both were king for period). The next generation it gets messy again. 

James II had two kids, Anne and Mary II. Both of them at some point took the throne. 
James II's *sister* Mary had a son, William III.. he married Mary II.. his cousin. Perhaps unsurprisingly that lineage ended there.

Again they went back up the tree, back to the children of James I (of England) and from there it was *reasonably* straight forward.

George I -&gt; George II -&gt; Skip Generation -&gt; George III -&gt; George IV / William IV (brothers) -&gt; Victoria (Neice of George and William) -&gt; Edward VII -&gt; George V -&gt; Edward VIII (abdicated to brother) George VI -&gt; Now

Chelsea is currently in such an upwards trend and now such a huge name to reckon with that even if Abramovich decides to sell us tomorrow, You would be able to fill the Matthew Harding Stand with new offers of rich owners begging to continue the Abramovich technique at Chelsea. In my opinion we wont even end up at this point considering Abramovich will only get more interested in Chelsea as he gets older and starts backing away from the rest of his businesses, not to mention his heir Arkady Abramovich is pretty much watching every game at the Bridge now and cheering us on.

So laugh in the face of the imbeciles who think we wont make FFP or will die down after Roman Abramovich.

Thats a meaningless quote maybe, but when you have people in the local pub which i had last night, talking about individuals who you have a bit of respect for it gets a bit depressing.

maybe its just teething trouble with the immediacy of information (right or wrong) being shared in new ways and by groups that have no accountability, either way nowadays anyone can get an audience, maybe the people listening aren't able to take the wheat from the chaff.

edit: maybe the best message that will come out of this is a reiteration that 'everything you read isn't necessarily true' - lessons that should be learnt early in a persons development. having a person like Phil Schofield doing what he did to an audience who might not have the sense to not believe everything he says is true, is tremendously cheap.

I'm curious as to why there weren't any defensive alterations even though Coates was being bullied by Traore. In the second picture, we can see that, when attacking, Coates is alone against the central striker (Traore) and Carragher and Wisdom are too far down the sides to help out. With some clever movement or footwork, the central striker there could easily be away from our defender and be in on goal (which happened a few times).

Their economic policy is to shrink the state. In Boro, the state is a massive employer and a lot of our small economy relies on the public sector.

But hey, who gives a shit, it's only Middlesbrough, right?

I mistrust and dislike most of the politicians in London because they all strike me as sales people, PR people and spin doctors. This government has no mandate for their economic policies and Gideon is at the helm of that. I just can't stand the man.

I know the job of the Chancellor is to make the books balance and keep the economy stable, but it is also his job to weigh up what is more valuable than the money it loses.

Healthcare for example, the NHS exists because as a country we agree that fair access to healthcare is more important than the money from our pay cheques that go into national insurance.

There are many institutions which are heavily criticised by a Thatcherite mentality who can only see value in profitability.

Royal mail, British film council, the local theatres that Stewart Lee is talking about, even something as fundamental as power generation was privatised because it cost the government money.

These accusations were from a boys home and the men who abused them would seem to have a preference for boys. Whether that alone makes them ""gay"" is up for debate. It's a difficult thing to work through, does Saville's preference for girls prove he was heterosexual? Probably not, but judging from various stories about this stuff it does seem that paedophiles usually have a gender preference that matches their general sexual orientation. Not 100% of the time of course.

The bottom line here is that many people assume that a higher proportion of gay men are likely to abuse boys than the proportion of heterosexual men who are likely to abuse girls. It's all bollocks of course, the numbers of abusers is very low in both cases and, even then, the vast majority of abuse is by a family member, not serial offenders like Saville.

Anyway, this was also about the same time I first got Netflix, and one of their early streaming options was Dr. Who. So I went back and watched every episode, and the rest is history. 

If i wanted to show someone 1 episode to get them hooked, I would go with something in the Tennant era, probably The Girl in The Fireplace. I think that episode captures the show pretty well, and would be an easy intro to the world of the Doctor.",0,1352477962,null,0,false,0,c6yu4fc,t3_12x021,t1_c6yu4fc,t3_12x021,null,1430362013,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

Ed Milliband [does not want this](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/aug/29/ed-miliband-labour-leadership-change) and its not the platform of his party.

UKIP may have a complete manefesto but they don't talk about it much. In terms of their non-election PR its all about the EU and very little else. The majority of people who vote for them do so because of their Euro-skepticism not for their health policy. (If you want to describe them as libertarianism I would remind you that they want to keep the NHS public and intend to expand the prison system, get rid of the Human Rights Act and get rid of the possibility of parole for people given life sentences. Sounds pretty authoritarian to me.)

I do agree with you on the last point though. There other democratic reasons to want to leave the EU but thats nothing that couldn't be changed by a treaty change (there will be one coming up soon) and if we wanted to the UK could be in the driving seat pushing for democratic reforms.

James, I can see you are coming along as a critic, but having read your entire site, I urge you to take responsibility for what you are doing. 

You might feel like your blog is informative and helpful to diners, but your amateur comments are inconsistent and to the trained eye, unfounded. 

Before launching into criticism of a respected industry and the organisations and individuals who work in it, I urge you to get a complete education on all matters on which you espouse your apparent expertise. 

Some basics include understanding the rhythm of a restaurant service, understanding the mechanics of a menu, understanding the delicate balance required to create the perfect dish and match it to a beverage and a context for dining. 

It is a rare feat to achieve this without committing to the industry for some time - years even. Consider Nicholas Lander as an example of an accomplished, informed, educated and sympathetic critic. 

Then you must learn how to review critically which demands a specific, transparent and consistent criteria. 

Before you join the ranks of respected food critics and seek to rank respected restaurateurs, chefs and fellow diners, you owe it to your readers to achieve these fundamental steps. 

Perhaps when you have achieved this level of understanding you might revisit some of your earlier reviews and reconsider your position. 

This is not an amateur sport, do not try this at home.

Gary Cahill has been playing very well and he is a worry both offensively (on set pieces) and defensively.

If Bertrand is playing instead of Cole, Sterling will have to exploit him on the right and create havoc over there. 

Mikel is quite good in the holding role and I think he will be playing along side of Ramirez (Lampard is still injured I think) who I believe is underrated. This will keep Gerrard and Sahin's hands full

Obviously the biggest worry is Mata, Oscar, and Hazard. We can talk about how Agger and Skrtel will stop them all we want but seriously, these three are the best midfield trio in the PL right now. Joe Allen is going to have to play the game of his life, he will need a huge turn around from the shift he put in last week.

Torres seems to be red hot or ice cold as of late, hopefully we get the latter on Sunday but it is entirely possible he will feel he has something to prove and play very well.

Madame Kovarian: The anger of a good man is not a problem. Good men have too many rules.

Which typifies the modern series. I need to revisit the earlier series because it may be the same as well. The constant internal struggle of the Doctor to do or even know what is right and his mostly limitless faith in humankind is what I find the most appealing. 

The fact that the show can change settings at will, from a 19th century manor to a defunct library in the future or modern day Utah, allows the viewer to see these issues of hope, struggle between good and evil, love are universal and play out everywhere. 

Or maybe it's just watching Pond in a skirt or Rose in jeans or Martha in everything or Donna telling the doctor off. I'm sure the Doctor is the attraction for others. 

""Blink"" seems to intrigue people to the show. And is really a good story. But I think the true draw to the show are the persistent story arcs and character traits that we get to watch over the course of seasons not just episodes.

You mean aside from the fact two same sex people who refer to themselves as ""married"" actually aren't, either in the eyes of religious organisations, nor indeed the state? It might only be a word, but given the controversy over it, I'm inclined to believe it matters.

Then there's religious couples - under the ""exactly the same"" Civil Partnership, they're unable to have any religious element at all, to their ""ceremony"". In short, if you're ""of the faith"" and want to get married in a Church? Not happening. You can't even get a ceremony - of any sort, bar *perhaps* a blessing of the wedding rings, in a church you might have practiced in each weekend for decades.

&gt;Apart from gay marriage which I would argue isn't a moral issue since same sex civil partnerships are legal in the UK **and not opposed at all by the church**.

Richard Chatres was one of the final candidates. That a man who fundamentally disagrees with the notion of Civil Partnerships could make it through to the final list of candidates - and that virtually *all* senior members of the CoE are **absolutely** against the notion of ""Gay Marriage""?

I know how you feel. The only reason I was enthusiastic about the rest of the series was because I knew the next few episodes were not written by Steven Moffat.

Whether it's coincidence or not, the only episodes I enjoyed in Series 7A were the non-Moffat ones.

&gt;you could differentiate it from Wolves centre by trying to make the outskirts a greener place.

One of our **preliminary** designs, bearing in mind that we're going for a super eco friendly and arguably super eco friendly LOOKING building, is to have a green roof which can also be used as a park. We are looking at the feasibility of this. In lieu of actual grass we might try to make an adjoing leisure complex and also have an astroturf pitch on the roof. This has been quite successful in dense environments such as Tokyo/NY.

The build will also be clad in wood and have a few other eco-looking things. It's gonna look lush.

&gt;Old\New stuff? Ditch the old, go with the new; Wolverhampton being part of the Black Country, needs to look to the future, rather than its clapped out, run down factory past. We;re going more high-tech now; shiny new metro, shiny new Jaguar plant; the days of moaning on about historical old stuff is the reason why Wolves isn't doing what it can do now - needs shiny ;)

I agree with you. Unfortunately though, the site has 2 large listed buildings and a tiny one, none of which we can knock down. We've also been told to 'try and connect the new and old buildings in some way'.. which basically means 'connect the new and old buildings'. We're thinking of something like [this](http://urbanarchives.org/case_files/series/Vancouver_Public_Library/folders/20040620/images/20040620TRD4030.JPG). The good news is that the old buildings are getting completely refurbished and made shiny-ish again. One wing of the Hospital building is structurally compromised and is getting demolished but other than that, it should all look fairly shiny and new when its done!

That kid stole the doctor's watch for no reason, played all the time with it, and the whole conflict would have ended one episode earlier if he just bothered to return it. And then at the end we have that whole war-hero-thingy going on with him as an adult, and I just still hated that annoying boy with all my heart. My annoyance with him even made me overlook the great doctor-johnsmith-martha development, sad, really.",0,1352488974,null,0,false,0,c6yx6uo,t3_12wyju,t1_c6yx6uo,t3_12wyju,null,1430363498,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3
true,_The-Doctor_,smith,Smith,"I understand that, when it comes to my companions... But it is still hard. Take River's parents for example.. The Ponds... I had to leave them... And it was hard.  I had to say goodbye to them... Rather have that than watch them in their graves. 

I act like I do, because I care for every single of my companions. Every single of of them has given me something to learn, and something to solve... But most of all, they are proof that it is hard letting go of the first people you meet. Little Amelia Pond... The first person I met in this form. I watched her grow up, and watched over her child... Melody Pond. As you also know as River Song. 

I traveled across the universe, collecting every single dept I had, to be able to save The Ponds, and River. I blew up the entire UNIVERSE to save them. 

I start to grow attached to them, on our travels. That's what makes it hard.

I know that you people have your own life and own missions. But it still makes it hard. I have just found out that you, left with my wife, without my knowledge. My wife who I have seen growing up, traveled with, and spent time with through unknown and incredibly dangerous moments. I married her, because she was the one woman I grew to love and adore. The one woman who I could find love with, that could last.
