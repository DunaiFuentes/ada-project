true,Sango12592,null,null,"My friends rant about this xD :


""Let's just go down the list of reasons why Rory is supposedly the Master. This is probably going to be pretty lengthy, so apologies in advance.

Reason 1) Wasn't surprised that the TARDIS was bigger
on the inside.

Neither was Wilf. Is he the Master too? Rory has grown up with Amy telling him about the Doctor and his magic time travelling box that apparently had a swimming pool and a library inside of it. Maybe he didn't believe her growing up, but after the Doctor turned up in the Eleventh Hour and everything else she told Rory turned out being true, why wouldn't he believe about the box with huge rooms in it? When Amy saw inside the TARDIS, she was more amazed than surprised. Rory just isn't as easily impressed, especially considering his fiancee's obsession with the Doctor.

Reason 2) Rory has died and died again and always comes back.

So is the person suggesting that he always comes back because he's a Time Lord? Then we're looking at two possibilities. Either Rory is aware that he's a Time Lord, or he's used a chameleon arch to make himself human. If he knew he were a Time Lord, wouldn't he just regenerate all those times he died? He doesn't regenerate, he just comes back. And considering we saw him as a child growing up with Amy, we know he ages at the rate of a human, which means he would have changed his DNA. If that were the case, he wouldn't have regenerative abilities, so even if he WERE a Time Lord, it would have nothing to do with him coming back every time he dies. If a Time Lord disguised as a human could come back that many times, then there's no difference between being that and just being human, so all of the plot devices that keep bringing Rory back are the real reason, and not because he's the Master.

Reason 3) In “The God Complex” Rory is the only one who does not have a room filled with his fears. When the Doctor opens the room with HIS fears, hesays “Of course it was you.” and we hear the TARDIS distress signal, which was only ever heard before when the Master stole the TARDIS.

First of all, it was discovered at the end of the episode that the rooms only showed your primal fears so you would fall back on your fundamental faith. It wasn't that Rory wasn't afraid of anything so much as he didn't have enough faith in anything to save himself. Of course, in Rory's own words, after everything he's seen and been through, what's left to be afraid of? More importantly, what does what the DOCTOR saw in his room have to do with RORY being the Master? Even if the Doctor's fear somehow translated to Rory, this reasoning is still flawed because they said the only time we've heard the TARDIS distress signal was when the Master stole the TARDIS. That's just plain incorrect. We've heard it multiple times like at the end of Turn Left, or the beginning of The Eleventh Hour when the TARDIS crash landed. It's a distress call indicating danger, and has nothing to do with the Master.

Reason 4) Rory complaining about a banging in his head.

THIS DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. As I already explained, you don't have to be a psychopathic Time Lord to experience banging in your head. In any case, he only complained about it that one time. Professor Yana said that he had heard it as long as he could remember, his whole life. So if Moffat ""doesn't throw things like that around pointlessly,"" then why haven't we ever seen any other references to the sound of drums with Rory?

Reason 5) Rory's daughter is half Time-Lord.

Yes. She is. And they explained that in the show. She was conceived in the TARDIS as it was flying through the time vortex, which exposed her to the vortex from the beginning of her very existence and caused her to have a few certain Time Lord abilities. Maybe the person who came up with this doesn't like this explanation, and that's fine, you don't have to like it, but it's the explanation we've been given and we're just going to have to accept it. Personally, I don't see why it's such an unacceptable explanation.

And reason 6) We never got a good explanation for the cracks in the universe, so it could be that the Master used them to come back.

I think somebody missed the season 5 finale. Remember, the one where the entire universe fucking ended because the TARDIS exploded? Now, we never got a good explanation as to how the TARDIS blew up in the first place, but we know it has something to do with the Silence. But whatever caused it to blow up, it was the act of the TARDIS exploding that formed the cracks in the universe. And if the Master did use the cracks to come back, it would have been a deliberate plot, which means he would have still been a Time Lord and not disguised as a human, which would be the only explanation for him growing up with Amy. Why would he go through all the trouble of coming through the cracks, only to immediately turn himself into a human child with no memory of anything?

So yeah. This is pretty much what I think any time I see any crazy theory, and I'm just left sitting there yelling at my computer screen at the people who actually believe it. So it feels good to get all of that off my chest. Sorry for venting.""",0,1344669348,null,0,false,0,c5rgeql,t3_y12b5,t1_c5rgeql,t3_y12b5,null,1429609270,63,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,63

2. OK, so you have perfectly good intentions to share this with the community. Good on you. Has the community seen this? In the case of this picture, there is a high probability that this specific picture has been seen before, but not with the specific instagramfilter that is applied.
3. So the next question is asked: does this add value to the community? 

It's an instagram filter of a seen picture. It's not some never-before-seen behind-the-scene picture. Chances are no, it does not add value to the community.

true,cyborg_127,lfc68,,"Just reading these stories gives me a warm fuzzy feeling inside. To know how great these supporters are of those who have travelled long ways, who are basically strangers, makes me all the more proud to have chosen this team to support. Here is my story.

I lost my way with football around the 2000-2001 mark, got into a bad relationship with some crazy psycho bitch. Many years later, I had the opportunity to start playing again, and at the time thought I might as well watch some games. I used to support Arsenal way back in 2000/1, but now knew nothing about any teams.

So, why Liverpool? Well, this was the 07-08 season, and it was Crouch. I was just watching whatever games I could, and all I remember was him. That tall, lanky bastard who looked like he was tripping over his own feet yet still managed to move the ball well - plus he had this totally cheeky grin. Then I started to learn about the other players. Carragher. Reina. Hyppia. Kuyt. Riise. Alonso. Mascherano. Benayoun. Torres. And then Gerrard. I fell in love with this team. I fell in love with the supporters. I live on the other side of the world and was staying up until anywhere from 2-6am on a Sunday/Monday mornings (even if I had work at 8/9am) to watch games. 

Slowly my relationship with the team grew. What started out as an enjoyable time watching quality games of football turned into yelling at the ref on the TV, bollocking players for making mistakes and cheering when we scored or applauding a great play. You should have heard me curse the living shit out of Charlie Adam for blazing his penalty over the bar. A few minutes later I was celebrating seeing our first silverware win live. 

I was sad to see Rafa go. I was worried about how Gillet and Hicks were fucking things up for this club with such a great history (history I had slowly been learning about) for their own greed. I wish to myself I had remained involved with football for my entire life, but it was not to be. But I know for the remainder, my heart belongs with Liverpool.

I first learnt about the Miracle of Istanbul from the video that is now linked on the right. I have downloaded the full game and like to let it play on my computer while I play other games. Still get that same feeling when Gerrard scores, and he gets the crowd going, even though I *know* how it all goes.

For me, I cannot define this club by a single memory, or a 'best' memory. Whenever I think of Liverpool, a whole lot of memories and experiences come to mind, and I cannot choose a single one as 'best'. But I don't care, this means my best memory is yet to come, and I look forward to that day. I just hope I can still share it with you when it happens.

It is my dream to get over to the UK (fortunately my mum was born there, should be easy) and watch a game at Anfield. One day I might consider moving there, if my partner (yes, she supports the Reds, but not quite to the same level as me) would be happy.

true,Ch13fWiggum,eng-Herefordshire,Herefordshire,"&gt;It's just a bit of fun

Yes, and here's the but, Humour and jokes often have a victim to make them funny - I believe it's called the superiority theory of humour - it states that most jokes have a victim or loser. Some people take it that all jokes have a winner and loser, whether it is a character in the joke of the teller/tellee of the jokes.

For example the joke ""what's brown and rhymes with snoop? Dr Dre""
The humour in this joke comes from the tellee thinking the first part of the joke is referring to poop, and more importantly the joke teller fooling the tellee into believing the answer to the question is poop. So in this the teller is asserting their superiority through the joke.

In the video in the link - Spandy Andy is the superior one, and the people on the train are the victims of the joke, their reactions are what makes it funny. Had he done this in his bedroom, with nobody to witness it would it be as funny to you? no, didn't think so. 

Now they realise they are being filmed (see people in the vid looking at the camera) they probably realise that their reactions make or break the skit, and they don't know how to act knowing that it is likely going to be on one guy's youtube channel later -do you want to be seen being into it and risk being called a perv, or do you want to be seen confronting the dude (stopping the joke, and being labelled a killjoy) There is no third option that would allow you to completely avoid humiliation; the normal third option, to walk away, has been taken away because it's on a train - so you have to find a new one, and that is where the ignore response comes in, pretend it isn't happening.

That's one interpretation of it at any rate, the other could be that Spandy Andy's video is funny because he's not following the unwritten social rules of society.

Edit: And regarding proof:

Akqayid called Saha and Nelsen hours before the papers and anyone else even thought about it. He also was very early with claiming AVB as our new manager. He also called Lloris quite early and if it turns out that Lloris signs it will be further proof that he is ""ITK"". Lloris is apparently in London to ""watch the olympics"" and was left out of Lyons squad for their game today. 

JJ doesn't really take that many risks with his statements but what he says usualy turns out correct. He is just a few hours before the papers etc. He is more like the responisble one that shoots down the false ITK.

When was the last time a smoker robbed you for money for ciggies? Or killed someone over the price of cigs? Or broke into your house to steal for smoking money? It doesn't happen. I label them as separate because they are not the same. If you do not realize that then you have no experience dealing with drug addicts, and cheapen what they actually go through. However you have made it apparent that you do not wish to have a conversation about this as you cannot have a conversation with anyone with a differing opinion to yours. It is far easier to just label me a drug addict and discount anything I have to say. I do not take offense, people like you tend to do this kind of thing often. It is ok to trample over the rights of every adult in the country, and take away their right to make their own decisions, as long as it is something that you agree with. Have a good day as well and I did not intend on offending either, but that doesn't matter, much like my opinion, because I clearly cannot think clearly because I am such a drug addict.

In fact, the most significant difference is that, under public funding, future high income graduates have the cost of their education subsidised by low income taxpayers who never went to university.

It's amusing to see those on the left defend such a regressive policy.

&gt; I'll tell you exactly who pays for it: higher education. It adds much much more to the economy than it gets in state funding. £60Bn a year by some estimates.

Both the police and councils will be speaking from experience regarding the connection between shutters and crime and anti-social behaviour. They will undoubtedly have noted a correlation between the prevalence of security shutters and incidences of crime and anti-social behaviour.

Of course, there will be some reverse causality at play. It is more likely crime leads security shutters than security shutters lead crime. But it wouldn't be surprising if there was a ""broken windows"" style effect leading the latter effect to occur in some form, which is what the spokesman is referring to.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; ""free education"" is a misnomer. 

It's not a misnomer at all, because the people who use the term know exactly what they mean by it. It's used in exactly the same way as free health care, or free roads; ie, free at the point of use. The only time it is ever taken out of context is by rather desperate people trying to construct a shitty straw man argument from it.

&gt; In fact, the most significant difference is that, under public funding, future high income graduates have the cost of their education subsidised by low income taxpayers who never went to university.

The person on high income will be paying a far bigger contribution, and the person on low income benefits greatly from the contribution of higher eduction to the wider economy. Their tax burden would need to be far higher without it.

&gt; The £60bn figure is rather disingenuous. 


How on earth can you claim a 'multiplier effect with all public spending' detracts from my statement. If anything, it means we should be doing more public spending. That aside, it's simply wrong. http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/publications/documents/economicimpact4full.pdf      




&gt; Academic papers. See Greenaway and Haynes (2003) for example.

I suggest you actually read it instead of taking the word of the blog that reported it to you. The main reason it puts forward the idea of charging students is because universities lack control over their income and faced constraints on their budget.

&gt; Reports since then have argued that a funding problem remains and HE providers
&gt; have limited degrees of freedom in ameliorating this, since they have no scope to
&gt; vary fees (at least in an upward direction) for British and European Union (EU)
&gt; students, (though they have complete discretion over the fees they charge students
&gt; from outside the EU).3 In this paper we argue that greater flexibility in setting fees
&gt; is a necessary development if additional resources are to be drawn into HE in the
&gt; UK, alongside a greater availability of loan finance, repayable on an income con-
&gt; tingent basis.


They go on to say


&gt; We begin by reviewing broad trends in HE funding in the UK and evaluate this
&gt; relative to elsewhere in the OECD. The evidence confirms both a secular decline
&gt; in public funding in the UK and that it is low relative to other industrialised
&gt; countries. But, of course, this is only an issue if declining funding can be associated
&gt; with deterioration in performance, which we address in Section 2. Any argument
&gt; that beneficiaries should make a greater contribution to tuition costs relies on a
&gt; demonstration that they would be better off than otherwise as a result of having
&gt; been to university.

Notice they are not setting out to demonstrate that graduates are the main beneficiaries of higher education, only that they benefit from it. The main beneficiaries are the companies that pay their increased wages. 

They go on to completely exclude any consideration of the benefits graduates provide the companies that employ them, and only consider the wages they are paid:

&gt; The simplest measure of the private benefits to tertiary education are higher sal-
&gt; aries graduates receive compared with non-graduates10 and it is straightforward to
&gt; estimate the additional income earned by a graduate (over a non-graduate with
&gt; two ‘A’ levels) over a working life. ...

That is a terrible measure of the economic benefit, as I'm sure even you can see, and it obviously makes it impossible to know from this report if students benefit more or less than industry. In fact, if you read the entirety of pages 7-10, they make absolutely no attempt to consider the economic benefits of graduate education to industry, with only a minor mention of it adding 2% to growth, which is a huge figure considering our growth rarely goes above 4%. 


Of course, as with all economic papers, it is heavily biased in favour of the private sector. It could easily have suggested the government should stop reducing its funding, as that would also have solved the problem.

This non competitive sort of approach is what's made Spain such a dominant footballing nation and why they have a 2nd team who would get into England's starting 11.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; The person on high income will be paying a far bigger contribution, and the person on low income benefits greatly from the contribution of higher eduction to the wider economy. Their tax burden would need to be far higher without it.

You're dancing around the point here. Yes, higher income taxpayers pick up more of the bill for higher education, but this has morally repugnant implications. I've mentioned the absurdity of low income taxpayers who didn't go to university subsidising the cost of high income taxpayers who did, but what about high income taxpayers who never went to university? 'Free education' is a minefield.

Surely you realise it makes more sense to tie the amount a person pays towards the cost of higher education to the benefits they have derived from higher education?

&gt; How on earth can you claim a 'multiplier effect with all public spending' detracts from my statement. If anything, it means we should be doing more public spending. That aside, it's simply wrong.

The £60bn figure is the result of some mind-bending arithmetic, and only really tells us that the higher education merry-go-round is causing a lot of money to change hands.

A lot of the public funding could be better spent elsewhere, on projects with similar multiplier effects and higher social rates of return.

&gt; I suggest you actually read it instead of taking the word of the blog that reported it to you. The main reason it puts forward the idea of charging students is because universities lack control over their income and faced constraints on their budget.

I have read the paper, and at the risk of sounding patronising, it was not reported to me by a blog. The relevant point I cited, emphasis mine:

&gt; The fact that social returns are relatively high and externalities present, underpins the case for continued taxpayer investment in higher education. However, **the excess of private over social returns in the UK conﬁrms that most beneﬁts from higher education continue to be captured by individuals. Moreover, given the socio-economic mix of students in universities, it also means that the subsidies being transferred are regressive.** Both justify a shift towards a more equitable ﬁnancial partnership with a greater ﬁnancial commitment coming from beneﬁciaries.

Yes he does.  All the goddamn time.  And it's infuriating to watch.  He will go so out of his way to drop hints at some greater plot, just to screw with those of us who care enough to bother to try and figure it all out from the clues.  His writing style is painfully simple in this regard.  Everything is exactly what it seems to be, and the simplest and most obvious solution is what will happen.  If you see something that hints at a deeper plot or some cool twist, ignore it.  It's there because Moffat wants you to think that it might be important so you'll be surprised when you hit the ending.

It's actually pretty neat in that regard.  He goes out of his way to drop hints and clues to make you start speculating.  And we're not even talking about weird stretches here; he drops clues that straight-up scream ""PAY ATTENTION TO ME I'M IMPORTANT!""  He then ignores them himself and gives you the most obvious solution you expected from the beginning.  You weren't expecting it anymore because of all the hints, so you're actually surprised.  It's kinda cool.  He can make you surprised at the most obvious and simple ending possible, that you would have assumed from the beginning had he not tried to lead you otherwise.  The real downside to this is that the hints allude to a much more interesting story that never unfolds.

Correct. Was as in past tense.

Correct. However the manual unloading of 24 tonnes of goods, strapping down loads, sheeting down loads, chaining down loads, humping high pressure hoses around is.

Yet my friend who is still a truck driver bought a house last year.

You ask the price, they tell you 800RMB. You tell them that's absolutely ridiculous, you won't go a penny over 350 RMB. They say I can't go any lower than 750. I walk away...the come after me and say 'okay okay, 600.' 

No, no, I say, 600 is way too much. I refuse to pay that. 400, maybe, I don't like it enough to go over 400. I don't have a real purpose for it, I just think it would be fun to have. The guy tells me he buy it for 500, which I know is bullshit, so I say 'I'll buy for 500 only if you throw in this over here.' 

A little more haggling, and I've got him convinced. 500 for the item I originally wanted and an add-on. I've saved 300, and I've got an extra toy to play with. 

In footballing terms, Levy over priced Modric and convinced everyone his value is 40 million. Everyone scoffs at the valuation at first, but they slowly warm up to it. When Levy offers 30 million plus a player, it starts to look like a bargain for Madrid. It looks like Levy is caving, that he's actually trying to meet them halfway. 

But he's not, it's just a bargaining trick. Overvalue something and you create a desperate need to have that thing. Then, when that desire is in place, you drop the price and it seems like a bargain. How will Madrid disregard this? 30 million plus a year loan for Sahin is great for them - Sahin gets first team play, Madrid gets Modric at what they think is a great deal. 

Madrid has been swindled and they didn't even realize it. If Sahin enjoys playing, he may even stay. This would give Spurs a shot at the star and would give us leverage if we want to purchase him - now it will be the Modric situation in reverse. Madrid won't really need Sahin because they've got Modric, and if Sahin wants to stay then we've got bargaining ability. 

If he doesn't want to stay, though, we have just been given a year breathing space to find a Modric replacement.

true,Clbull,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"I hated sports day at primary school. It was not only saddening to my (childhood) mind because being last place pissed me off, and was where I finished **every year** but it was entirely track events. It's called 'Sports Day' yet is entirely running events, or the dumb 'Parents Race' or 'Egg and Spoon Race.' The last sports day I ever participated in was during secondary school where I was ordered to compete in the 400m dash because Sports Day was made compulsory that year. Predictably, I finished last place, about 25 seconds behind second-last and with the entire school as an audience to demonstrate my humiliatingly awful running capabilities. Around that point I already stopped giving a fuck years ago and hated sports ever since. By making this shit even more compulsory than it already is, you are going to make more children and adolescents hate sport. It's at the point where I have a disdain for watching spectator sports.

How about instead of just saying ""Competitive sports should be compulsory"", do what the yanks do. Establish student sports leagues for both secondary and sixth-form/FE-college students and encourage (as in not force) them to participate. Perhaps even do a deal with some television networks to televise student sports both at school, college and university level and facilitate some kind of process whereby professional teams can acquire highly performing student players on a contract.

Offer a wide range of sports (and make such a comprehensive list compulsory to offer at each school) such as swimming, javelin, fencing, volleyball, karate, kickboxing, track, gymnastics, cycling, tennis, BMX, skateboarding, football, basketball, rugby, baseball, even american-football if you wish. I would have fucking loved to do some of these as an extra-cirricular activity but there was simply nothing really available.

In cities like London it is almost impossible to build high-rise without visual intrusion on particular heritage assets or conservation areas (cf. The Shard &amp; St Paul's). Similarly, Britain tends to protect every bump in the ground in rural areas with area of natural beauty designations so again these are what lead to rejections of high rise. However, to the best of my knowledge there is no protective planning designation for the entire skyline of any city in the UK (at this scale it would be some sort of World Heritage Site I would expect). The resistance to high-rise is often therefore the product of elected Members rather than the advice of their planning officers. 

Believe me, the planning profession is not a barrier to house-building because it is imbued with anti-development ethos, quite the opposite.

true,Stavrosian,nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"If you want to improve the calibre of sportsman we produce in this country, you need to focus on skills. Competition in sport is everywhere for those who have the talent and the inclination - in inter-school matches, at clubs, in games taking place on the playground at lunchtime. Use compulsory time to teach people the skills they need to succeed, not simply to test if they have already succeeded.

I played a lot of sport competitively when I was a kid, and PE lessons were a waste of time for me. There was no benefit in my playing a competitive game of rugby against people who don't play rugby, or tennis against people who don't play tennis. I win easily without having any fun or learning anything, they feel like shit and resent the game (without learning anything) and then we do the whole stupid thing again next week.

I want compulsory sports education to focus on teaching people skills and putting those skills into practice against people on a level playing field. Set kids skills challenges and then demand that they improve their own performance - say you want them to dribble round a set of cones with a football in twenty seconds at the start of the year, but fifteen by the end of it, and you spend the interim teaching them about ball control and improving their speed through tightly-focused sessions. Focus on having them pass the ball from one foot to another, get them to control passes hit to them with their weaker foot, anything that will help them improve the skills they need to beat your challenge. Have them race against people at their own level to spur each other on to improve. You get to show everybody clear data to prove that they are learning something, and you get to help people at every part of the talent spectrum, rather than just forcing the naturally sporty to shit all over the rest for no benefit to either.

true,pedantic_cunt,null,null,"I have to be the pedantic cunt to point out that this article is about primary schools. Most of these comments are based on secondary school experience/opinions and hence provide solutions based on bigger institutions with more pupils and funding. 
While 'forced' competitive sports will breed resentment in a number of individuals, team sports is a much more realistic goal for primary schools. State primary schools have neither the resources nor the facilities to implement a plethora of activities, they also struggle to get the staff with expertise to teach/run these clubs. 
Relying on local sports clubs is an option but once again, these will be predominantly team sports as they get better funding and have more staff available. Team sports require minimal facilities (although some primary schools don't even have access to a pitch). It is very difficult to offer skateboarding or cycling if kids don't have their own gear. 
One option that has been implemented where I grew up is the primary school mentoring system where secondary school PE departments and staff offer facilities and support for the local primaries in order to improve sport where their own resources let them down. It's still in its infancy but appears to be both improving sport and encouraging participation in kids who otherwise wouldn't. It also allows he offering of more individual sports such as skateboarding - they even bought some decks for those who didn't have one.

true,beard-maketh-the-man,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; Competition shouldn't be avoided just because some kids don't like losing, or some parents don't want their little darlings to have to face the realities of the world.

Pointless competition is worth avoiding.

I see people competing trying to one up themselves with their cars.  I don't play that game, even when I could afford too.  It's the classic ""I earn more than you"" / ""I have better stuff"" competition.  

I've already mentioned my issue about competition in sports has nothing to do with that pathetic attitude of ""everyone should be a winner"".  I just don't feel there's any need to force children into sports they don't enjoy or like, when there's so many other options and only a limited amount of time.

One of my friends brothers hates sports, he spent his time on the computer hacking away while he had all the time in the world.  He was competing in that situation too (cracking games / hacking online game scores).  He's now an adult with a valuable skill which he learnt because he had passion for it.  He'll will be commanding a fair amount of money in his life just like his brother (who doesn't work for anyone but himself).  He got nothing from sports, other than fitness, but he didn't put in the effort so didn't even get the benefits of exercise either.  Just wasted his time.

That's just an anecdotal tale of the pointlessness of forcing kids to do competitive sports.

PE is great and should be encouraged, but there's so many more ways that team sports.  School gyms should be filled with soft mats and gymnastic equipment, teach them parkour, get them out of a BMX at the local park, disc gold or even walking is great, create treasure hunts in the woods, swimming . . . I could go on for a while.

There's also this, which I didn't even think about:

I know that the city of Coventry has received numerous requests for the licence to serve alcohol be withdrawn. The police have been involved due to the fact that they had to post officers outside the place to protect it. Suppliers have been put under pressure to review the relationship with browns and many in Coventry are embarrassed with this place (I know this due to the fact I am one of the people that wrote letters and emails).

If you look at reviews for Browns you will find a long history of people being refused service and entry without explanation, even people who have spent the afternoon in Browns that have left for some reason have been refused re-entry a short time later. I believe facebook has a campaign to close the place.

If, as you postulated, this is illegal under case law I have to wonder why no one has brought this to the attention of the police or council. Several members of the council have publicly stated that they want to see browns close but have no powers under which to act. 

I am going to apply Occam’s razor here and draw the conclusion that you are in fact mistaken in your belief and that the right to refuse service is, as I postulated, correct. 

If you ever do find the case law on this let Coventry council know as they would appreciate it.

And they are *definitely* legal tender!

What I found more amusing is that in the US people take $100 bills without even flinching.. and they are valued higher than a £50 - and I'll be honest I don't see that US money has as many security features as ours, though I might be mistaken.

Another interesting point (sorry for babbling on, and going way off on a tangent, haha..) is that £20 in 1985 is equivalent to £50 today... so if taking a £20 note in 1985 is basically identical to taking a £50 note today.",0,1344696891,null,0,1344697083,0,c5rja8o,t3_y1iom,t1_c5rja8o,t1_c5rh6du,null,1429610617,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

In a nutshell, it suggests that only in the final stages of development (14-16 for Females, 15-18 for Males) should competition be focused upon, and then even later should winning be focused on.

It can be seen as a progression:

1) FUNdamentals (using games with young children to develop key basic skills)

2) Learning to Train (Start to learn things about sport, such as the importance of warm-ups, cool downs, nutrition etc.)

3) Training to Train (High volume, low intensity workloads with a focus on aerobic conditioning. For reference, this stage is for Females : 11-14, Males 12-15)

4) Training to Compete (High volume workloads with increasing intensity.  More specialisation too, focusing on the individual's needs)

5) Training to Win (Emphasis on specialisation and performance enhancement)

true,hampa9,null,null,"Experience of being bad at something is only valuable if you actually enjoy it despite your lack of skill. For example, the videogame Team Fortress 2. When I first played it I was dreadful but I still had a really good time and that meant I had a desire to improve. Trying to encourage me to play football however is a lost cause. Guess what sport we played twice a week for 5 years of secondary school?

Most of my experience of that game, and of other team sports, was standing around waiting for something to happen. Occasionally the ball might come near me, and I would inevitably end up doing the wrong thing which would lead to shouting and swearing from my teammates who were much more passionate about the game than I was. I would have happily left them to play it without my interference if I was just allowed to go for a walk or do table tennis or something. So after 5 years I was arguably worse at football than I was beforehand because I would actively try to avoid the ball. There was no real sustained exercise so I didn't get any fitter. People would ask me whether my team had won afterwards, I didn't really care so I'd tell them I didn't know.

Whenever competitive elements were introduced it was fine for those who were good at it and enjoyed it, for me and others like me it just turned me off from exercise altogether. You'd get the PE teachers spouting the same old crap like you do but it didn't do me any good. Being patronising and telling the goalkeeper to get out the way so I could score a pretend-goal didn't help either. There were a few weeks when it rained where we just did table tennis and it was fantastic. There was no boy/girl separation so I could play with all my friends. And while this might annoy you, we didn't pay attention to who was winning. After the hour was over I'd be worn out yet I didn't even realize I'd been exercising because I'd been having so much fun, and all the while I'd been improving my game.

This can work for every sport just by putting people in smaller groups and taking off the pressure. Cricket, for example - when I played it casually with friends or family it was great because there were as few rules as possible and no-one cared who won. At school it was much more serious, people would be screaming and shouting at me to either run this way or do that or drop the bat and I would have no idea what I was supposed to do so I would sit on the sidelines as much as possible. Arguably most of the time spent playing cricket by anyone was standing still, or queuing.

My secondary school was a recognized sports college.  We had 3 large fields and an astroturf football field.  We had a pretty good rugby field, a cricket.. whatever it's called with a pavilion, both indoor and outdoor tennis courts, basketball courts, weights, rowing machines etc etc.  Was pretty fancy, and amazing if you were into sports.


As part of our application to become a sports college we got sponsored by HP, so had 4 fully fitted out computer labs.  I mean, at that time, state of the art computers.  This was a state funded school btw, just in a very rich area (Windsor).

  I
I wasn't interested in sports - competitive or not.  I wasn't unfit in anyway.  On an average weekend I walked and ran 10-15 miles a day over fields and Windsor Great Park.  I didn't want to row, or play rugby, or play football, or play tennis, or throw rocks and spears, or run or whatever else.


I wanted to learn about computers.  All these amazing computer facilities, and a considerable amount of our education was spent pissing about with sporty crap I haven't cared about since.


All our computer education was shit.  Was basically learn MS Office tools.  Soon as those computers got installed I spent every lunch hour and hours after school messing with them and worked out all that stuff pretty quickly.  I'm no expert, but at that age I was interested in learning more, and fairly talented compared to my peers.  I grew up self teaching myself BASIC, and would have loved to have been taught basic fundumentals of programming when I was still young.


But noooo.  If you were good at sports (or at least enjoyed it) then you could get extra coaching, attentive teaching etc.  If you were good at computers, you obviously hadn't used the overglorified typewritters right.  I ended up teaching myself.

The quick and dirty: That Amy/Rory were after they got dropped off after The God Complex.

The slightly longer answer, the season can be a bit complicated to follow, as we start off from Amy/Rory's perspective, but then quickly go to The Doctor's perspective of things. From Amy/Rory, they get the blue letter inviting them to America, see The Doctor die, then run into the younger Doctor and go on the adventures for the season. Then, during God Complex, The Doctor drops them off as to keep them safe, and we don't see them again until the scene in which River informs them that The Doctor is alive, and they seem to have started getting memories of all of time and space happening at once.

From The Doctor's perspective, he runs into Amy/Rory at the diner, they go on adventures until he drops them off after God Complex.

true,Stavrosian,nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"Thinking more about what you said, I should go further and say that an ideal PE lesson would allow kids to focus either on something they enjoy or that they excel at (or preferably both, of course). The only time this really happened for us was at the end of the school year when we switched from team sports to athletics, and everybody got to try everything then specialise in whatever they wanted.

I know that (top cyclist, for the unaware) Mark Cavendish recently spoke out about how all he wanted to do in PE lessons was ride his bike, but he was never allowed to do so. We have a responsibility to kids to nurture their talents wherever possible, and also to allow them to enjoy themselves while getting the benefit of exercise wherever possible. I hope there is some kind of sporting activity, however serious, that everybody could enjoy. One of the favourites at my school was when the teachers turned the gym into a giant obstacle course, where the whole lesson was spent diving and running around with everybody laughing their heads off and no competitive aspect for those who didn't want it.

It would be perfect, then, if we could specialise in skills training for those who would benefit from it and simple, entertaining exercise for those who wouldn't, but I worry about a two-tier system and what it does to somebody's potential when we abandon the idea of them having talent at too young an age. I saw so many people who suddenly became fast, strong or coordinated in their teenage years, and if we've already abandoned the idea of teaching them skills in order to focus purely on fun, we might have blown their chances at making a career from sport.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"First off, the beginning of the movie is not very well explained. A lot of people complain about how the Daleks are portrayed, and it's partially due to the nature of the movie, and partially due to the prologue being a little half assed. Essentially, during his attempts at keeping himself alive, The Master has resorted to helping out The Daleks. However, the Daleks discover that The Master has been planning to betray them, and upon confirming this, they decide to have him exterminated. During his last moments, he creates a psychic link with The Doctor, pleading to have his remains brought back to Gallifrey as a last request. The Doctor finding it hard to deny a last request, let alone from someone whom he used to call a friend, he decides to oblige and attains the remains of The Master from the Daleks. All this is glossed over in the movie, but is very well written out in the novelization.

Second most important thing to keep in mind is that this was supposed to be a pilot movie. If it were to be successful, then it would be picked up as a TV show, and rejuvenate the Doctor Who franchise. So there are many things(Like the Master/Dalek relationship just mentioned) that kind of get brought up, but don't go anywhere. This is because it was intended that the movie would eventually become a series, and these points could be expanded. Imagine if all the New Doctor Who got was Rose, and we were left with all these questions of the Time War, and Eccleston only got a few minutes of screen time fighting mannequins. My guess is people would not have looked as favoritivly upon the new series if that's all there was. In fact, when it first came out, there was quite the excitement over it. It wasn't until the show was cancelled, and people didn't see a series come of it that it started putting a bad taste in people's mouths.

I'll cover a bit of a double point in one. For starters, it's very 90's, and you'll see what I mean when you watch it. For this reason, it's a bit of a sore thumb in the series, simply because it doesn't quite fit with the feel of classic Who, but it doesn't fit in with New Who, either. If anything, it's a very nice fit in between the two series, though. Another thing that came with that, though, was the reveal that The Doctor is half human(On his mother's side). Honestly, myself, I could go either way with this point, but for many others its been a polarizing revelation. Some people refuse that he is nothing less than 100% Time Lord, and others are fond of the reveal as it helps explain his love for humans. Either way, it hasn't been brought up since, and probably never will, so instead of being upset over it, I would suggest just making up your own mind like everyone else has. Both ideas are supported in extended media. So it can either be fully accepted, or as stated in the IDW comic The Forgotten, you can believe that The Doctor was using a half broken chameleon arch to disguise himself as half human.

Finally, Paul McGann is amazing, and really makes the movie. He has an amazing portrayal of The Doctor, and it really is a shame he didn't get the series he deserved. I guarantee that, at the very least, you will fall in love with him. There are also a ton of references to Doctor Who, including several fourth Doctor references(See if you can spot them all!). People say it's not very faithful to Doctor Who, but honestly, it really is. The only thing most people have a gripe over is the half human thing, from what I've noticed.

Just relax and enjoy it. Honestly, I feel like it's better than quite a few episodes of New Who. So if you can get through episodes like Fear Her, Fear and Monsters, and some other pretty bad episodes, you can certainly get through this and enjoy it. Just give it a chance, and don't go into it prepared to hate it like so many others do :).",0,1344700688,null,0,false,0,c5rjzn4,t3_y1tls,t1_c5rjzn4,t3_y1tls,null,1429610949,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

Somehow I think not. I get the impression that you are using it to mean discrimination that has its basis in a culture. But I think that this just sensationalizes the issue.

true,_sik,null,null,"I'm a recently graduated EU student who studied economics at Cambridge. OP, what is your nationality/cultural background btw? I don't mean to pry, but this affects the advice I'd give you somewhat.

Just a quick correction to the helpful post above:

&gt; (and they might well ask what motivated your choice of college)

I think they're expressively forbidden to ask you about what motivated your college choice or whether you've made an open application. This is just one of those criteria (like your political or religious views) that they're not supposed to take into account when deciding whether to admit you or not. They will just gloss over the college choice question in the interview, but they did ask me why I chose Cambridge for my course. This sounds like an innocent question, but it's good to think about it a bit, as it could reflect badly on you if you're caught off-guard with this - they could just assume that you're applying for the wrong reasons (prestige, starting salaries, hoping that just the uni name will open doors for you or w/e) and don't want to say it out loud.

My own opinion is that you shouldn't look at the international figures too much as A) there aren't huge cultural differences re internationalism between colleges; I'm not aware of any B) all the big international groups have their own societies and it isn't hard at all to befriend lots of people from your own nationality/region or even internationals in general. On the contrary it's probably more of a risk that you segregate yourself too much with people who have a similar background with you. Befriending those natives can take some effort, but once you've done it they're a friend for life and they have the most interesting insights into their country. Especially for a subject like law/politics/economics/history it's very useful to have someone who can explain those cultural references and tidbits of knowledge that people sometimes just assume you know. Supervisors are always very helpful too, but sometimes you just want to ask those ""dumb"" questions in a more informal setting. Btw, a useful skill to learn is that it's fine not to know or understand something, just don't be too embarrassed about it and don't nod your head in ""understanding"" just to get out of the situation. This is just my own guess, but they might like you more if you display this skill in the interview.

And yes, my impression is too that the n.o 1 thing they're looking for is enthusiasm for your subject. Just imagine you're having a discussion/debate about legal matters with a friend in a pub or a similar setting: would it be a topic you'd enjoy discussing? Could you comment on current pressing legal affairs? Would you have a bit of a personal viewpoint on some of these you could argue (obviously backing it up somehow)? If the answer to all three of those is yes then you're basically what they're looking for. If you get this enthusiasm across genuinely the rest is more or less out of your hands. Well, then perhaps the point about dealing with a tough question: don't get shellshocked, tell them what you know, explain your reasoning, basically just try to show them that you can think creatively even if you don't know the answer.

One final tip to help with you nerves: don't give up even if you think you failed an interview horribly. I came out of my first interview kicking myself and thought there might be no point going to the second one. I managed to turn the small talk at the beginning that's meant to be relaxing into an awkward moment by being super nervous, I half-stuttered my answers, thought I completely botched a straightforward complementary question and at one point had to take probably 2 minutes to explain economies of scale in a really clunky way because I had forgotten the expression. To top it all off I hit my forehead quite HARD on the door frame when I was leaving, despite my interviewer having told me to mind my head when I had come inside the room (so essentially I looked like a moron who couldn't follow simple orders). I left grimacing in pain pretending that I hadn't hurt myself too badly to just get out of there. Two years later I had a tutorial interview with the same academic and she told me that she'd given me really good marks for my interview although we both laughed about how nervous I had been. I had some good moments in the interview, but for some reason I discounted those and just focused on the negatives - almost to my detriment.

Teaching a kid that he's fucking awful at running once a week doesn't help ""instil the desire for winning in them"" it just makes them think they're fucking awful at running.

- I buy a few houses in a neighbourhood

7-10 year olds fucking love running about and playing sport, all that this is suggesting is that they play a competitive sport as opposed to Indian dancing, or a football match where everyone is a winner because no on is keeping score, which is ridiculous.

C.  Brazil's midfield was pretty bad too.  Not sure whether to blame your boy Oscar, or someone else.  I thought Sandro looked like the best individual performance from that area.  But, there was no midfield unity, which maybe came from nobody taking charge.  If that's the case, maybe it was Sandro's fault.

D. Hulk looked like the best player on the field the whole time he was there.  Somebody should splash cash on that.  Hopefully not Roman, but wouldn't be surprised.

Walking is good exercise.

http://www.livestrong.com/article/296995-how-many-calories-do-you-burn-by-walking-for-45-minutes/

&gt; A 200-lb (14 stone) person burns 136 calories walking 2 mph for 45 minutes and 224 calories walking 3 mph. A faster pace of 4 mph burns 340 calories.

If someone at that weight walked for less than 1 hour a day (say at night after a meal) rather than watching TV, for a week, that'd be roughly 1500+ calories a week.

3200 calories is 1lb of fat.

People can achieve much higher levels of fitness and melt some fat off by not putting in loads of effort.  Combine walking such a small amount with a calorie controlled diet and you're onto a winner.

true,beard-maketh-the-man,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"1500 calories a week via less than an hours gentle walk.

That's 6000 calories a month.

3200 calories is a pound of fat.  14 pounds to the stone.

Combine that very light exercise along with cutting out 200 calories a day (two slices of white bread) and now you're looking at another 1400 calories a week via diet.

1500 + 1400 calories = 2900 calories per week

**2900 x 4 = 11600 calories = About 3.6 pounds of fat in a month, by doing very little.**

So if someone did nothing other than a little bit of walking and a tiny amount of calorie control they'd lose around.

Walking isn't just good exercise, it's great.  It takes so little effort to get results that it's the perfect way to get people *into* getting fitter.

So if you don't want to call it good, crack on, I'm not going to argue semantics.  I'll look at the numbers and listen to [expert advice](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/getting-started-guides/Pages/getting-started-walking.aspx) and see results in /r/fitness and /r/loseit.

And yes, I did walk myself fit.  Because after not being able to walk to the corner store without being sweaty and winded, walking was the first thing I did and still do because it's so cheap and easy without being strenuous at all and I already had a pair of shoes.  Once I was slightly fitter and more educated regarding foods (fat = good, simple carbs need limited, calories add up fast etc) then I started cycling.

Property buyers are taking a risk. Their net worth becomes linked to the house price, which is affected by many things they can not control.

Whereas renting is very flexible. After the minimum term, most contracts are monthly, so you can leave at any time you want. You can move to another city with almost no hassle. If you can't afford rent, you downsize.

However, if this wasn't the case, if these communities did still desire separate play services for mother and child. I see no reason not to give it to them.

There's no problem with the reporting in this case, and in general the problem with the Daily Mail is not its reporting so much as its editorial. Any mature, intelligent person can quite happily read the Mail (amongst other news sources) and sort the wheat from the chaff.

If someone decides they don't want to give them any hits, then fine - don't visit their links. But there's an achingly smug trend amongst UK redditors whereby this essentially meaningless personal preference has to become a public stance which is effectively censoring or hijacking threads. Sometimes people post a link to an alternative news source, and that's fine. But in this case the commenter just refused to visit the link and posted a comment that can only have been intended to dissuade other people from visiting it too (either that or he/she simply comments on the banalities of their link-clicking decision-making process). So someone posts a salient and interesting link to this thread, but because it's from the Daily Mail a redditor thinks it's not only not worth reading, it's worth posting a comment saying it's not worth reading. And this is a link to a report that has nothing particularly objectionable about it in terms of facts or reporting, and which does not seem to have been picked up elsewhere, and which contains interesting facts directly relevant to the thread.

Much of the time, the writers don't even *know* the surprise they're supposedly planting clues for, and then they have to scramble and come up with a last minute explanation that fits at least some of their clues.  That's Lost.  That's Battlestar Galactica.  That's Heroes.  And a dozen other shows I could name.

My point is, viewers have become so conditioned to think in terms of ""the wildest most unlikely reveal you'll never see coming"" that they embrace stuff like this.  It's got no taste, it doesn't make thematic or emotional sense, there's no logical reason for it.  Aha, say some people, that's what we've been taught to expect from television!

First Doctor: An Unearthly Child (4 parts - the first one is a classic, the other three are meh) The Daleks (7 parts, but worth it). The Aztecs is supposed to be good as well, but I haven't seen it yet.

Second Doctor: Tomb of the Cybermen (4 parts) The Time Meddler (5 shorter parts). Unfortunately a lot of the Second Doctor's serials were wiped.

Third Doctor: Spearhead from Space (4 parts, first Auton story), The Time Warrior (4 parts I think, first appearance of Sontarans and Sarah Jane). Haven't seen most of his stuff, but I know the Master (as well as Jo) first appear in Terror of the Autons. There's also The Three Doctors.

Fourth Doctor: The Ark in Space (4 parts), Pyramida of Mars (4 parts), Horror of Fang Rock (4 parts), The Ribos Operation (4 parts), City of Death (4 parts). And there's a lot more of his which I heard were good.

This is why I avoid a lot of the hardcore sites like Gallifrey Base, because of the ceaseless arguments and criticism. I like discussions and appreciation instead. That's not to say I love everything about every episode, there are some that I don't like a lot, but even those have their good points.

The First, Second, and Seventh Doctors aren't my favorites, but I still watch and appreciate them. Occasionally, I find a episode that I really like from their periods. The more I watch the broader my appreciation becomes.

I think that people who fixate on a particular Doctor or companion are selling their experience short. One of the reasons that this show has lasted 50 years is that it has developed a pretty unique way to accommodate change. As fans, we have to accept that and change along with the show. Although I have loved the Ponds as companions, I accept that it is time for them to go.  So I am definitely sad about that, but I'm looking forward to seeing Jenna Louise Coleman come on board.

The problem is inconsistency... and not just the little inconsistencies that one must expect from a show about time travel, I'm talking about glaring contradictions that totally destroy the entire central story. 

For example: 

1) In Blink, the entire point of the creatures is that they cover their eyes to avoid looking at one another.  It was a central plot point that ended up being the Angels' undoing.  

At the end of Flesh and Stone, when Amy was trying to navigate with her eyes closed (more on that later), she was surrounded by Angels, none of which were covering their eyes, all of which were looking at one another.  So they are apparently no longer ""lonely assassins."" 

2) When the angels are being observed, they *don't exist.*  So how, exactly, would they know whether or not Amy could see?  It's not like they are hiding out in the stone, aware of what is going on around them.  No, when they are stone, they *do not exist.*  

3) In Blink, there were several pictures of the Angels that were totally benign (if I remember correctly, she included them in the folio she gave to the Doctor at the end.)  

All of a sudden, images of angels turn into angels?  If that is the case, why don't angels pop up in EVERYBODY's eyes?  The eye creates an image of whatever you're looking at, then translates that image into impulses. 

****

So. The two episodes directly contradict themselves to the point where they are *not even the same monster.*

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"I don't really think those are inconsistencies.

1)The angels from Time of Angels and Blink are two different types of angels. Not entirely in the 'different species' kind of way, but in Blink they were scavengers, while in Time of Angel they were a colony of angels. So, by their individual nature, they're going to act differently considering they're in different circumstances. In Time of Angels I don't think there was ever a point in which they were all consistently looking at one another like they were in Blink. That's the thing, in Blink it wasn't enough to have one look at another, because then that one could always still look away, or have their vision interrupted by another angel. It was important that they were tricked into directly staring at one another, all at the same time. None of them were slightly looking to the side, or had some chance that their view was obstructed. No, they were looking directly at each other, dead in the face. You don't see this in Time of Angels, as they're always either looking slightly away, or are layered(One is in back of another) in which it makes it more feasible for them to move around without completely blocking another angel. Also, being a colony, they're going to know how to move effectively around one another, especially given the nature of themselves. There also had to be hundreds that we didn't even see for this reason, and the only ones we saw were the ones closest to Amy, while others were watching, waiting, and moving about. Simply put, they know how to move, they know their scope of vision, and even if one looked at another it wouldn't matter so long as they other wasn't looking back(Such as in Blink). These angels also wouldn't cover their eyes as they weren't scavengers, and were more like a trained army of hunters.

2)I personally didn't have a problem with this, because even in Blink The Doctor says that them turning into stone is an instinct, and instinct can be tricked. I remember taking psychology 101, and one of the first things the professor went over were instincts, and her first example was with newborn babies, who work off only instinct. I've since forgotten them, but she taught us various ways you can trick a baby into acting a certain way, because you cause their instinctual behavior to kick in, and they're reacting to something completely different they think is happening. This is how I felt with Amy, that The Doctor was helping her trick their instincts, and in turn caused them to stay stone and not exist.

3)While the phrase is 'A picture of an angel becomes an angel' that's not exactly it. In Time of Angels The Doctor explains the video recorded angel as the original angel simply reaching out to see them. Again in Stone and Flesh when the angels fall into the crack, he tells Amy she can open her eyes because the angel that was projecting through her vision had fallen into the crack, and thus could no longer project itself. So it's not that the picture itself becomes an angel, but it becomes a projection for the angel that it is a picture of. This is why there is no issue in Blink, because those were scavenger angels that would not have the energy to project themselves. Also, if I recall, aren't the pictures of the angels as they're staring at each other? I could be wrong as it's been a bit since I've seen Blink, but that also would make the point moot as even if the pictured angels became sentient angels, they'd still be staring at other angels in the picture.",0,1344726056,null,0,false,0,c5rpk19,t3_y25tj,t1_c5rpk19,t1_c5rp99a,null,1429613647,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

I've not seen enough of Wilson at CB to have an opinion, but I agree with you that he won't be a left back at Liverpool. A loan to a team looking for a footballing centre-back would seem ideal.

It's been a mantra for Liverpool for more than a decade, but we're in the market for a left-back; however, pace and technique are what we're prioritising rather than defensive solidity.

I think it's problematic regarding Glen Johnson as a left-back, too. He's great there in a 4-4-2, but under Rodgers the full-backs have to provide the attacking width by overlapping the inverted wingers / inside forwards. Glen's a much bigger asset on the right than the left in that system, and Kelly's a big step down (his future is in the centre of defence). Agger probably can do the job as you say, but we really want him in the middle.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"&gt; Yes, you certainly could. But that would tell you nothing about the population density of England as a whole.

I never said it would - in fact I clearly indicated an intent to ""manipulate statistics""

But then again, countries are just arbitrary subdivisions that people draw on a map for political reasons. Where I am in south-east England, what affects me is the population in the area where I live, not the fact that somewhere up north there's less people around.

The population of England as a whole obviously has some relevance in that we have the same national government, the same inland revenue etc. But still, getting back to the context of the OPs post, just because there's some empty properties in Yorkshire doesn't mean I'm free to move there, no matter how overpriced and crappy my half-of-a-crappy-house ""flat"" is.

If you can't live without named subdivisions, well why not pick on counties rather than countries?

But still, getting back to the reason why I said ""manipulate statistics"", there's e.g. reasons why the US prefers to measure resource use and pollution relative to land area rather than population. [How to Lie with Statistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Lie_with_Statistics) is even an old book title. But the problem is that there's no one guaranteed non-deceptive way to use statistics. Judging population purely based on each nations total population can easily be deceptive when populations aren't distributed evenly within nations, depending on what you use those statistics for.

All you can really do to avoid being deceived is to be aware of the issue, look for a variety of different relevant statistics, and use some common sense.

Overall, I'd say my attitude over the whole thing  has changed from complete disdain to mild ambivalence, which is a massive improvement in my books.

The Doctor clearly did not fully understand Weeping Angels before that point, and even learned a few things from reading the book in the episode. This shows, right off the bat of the episode, that the previous things The Doctor has said about the angels might not have been entirely accurate.

The screwdriver thing, pardon my saying, would have been rubbish. It would have been a little on the forced side, and they weren't biologically different, they were psychologically different. As I said, it's not that they were a different species, as far as the viewer could tell, but they were part of a colony where the angels in Blink were not.

Which also went to show The Doctor's ignorance. The only reason he allowed a whole army down into the caves, along with himself, was he didn't consider that angels might have pack instincts like they did in the episode.

Anyway, I suppose that I'm ready for Amy and Rory to pack up, because they don't have that trusting relationship with the doctor that the other companions have.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"I'll go ahead and answer your Big Finish audio question! It's basically a company that makes audio productions(Not just of Doctor Who, but several other things). The guy behind Big Finish is basically a huge fan of Doctor Who, and along with Mark Gatiss, made his start by essentially writing Doctor Who fan fiction. Eventually this lead into obtaining the rights to making Doctor Who audio adventures, and they haven't looked back since. They've recently gotten their license renewed until 2015.

They essentially make audio adventures of Doctors 4-8(To my understanding their license only covers 'classic' Doctors, so they don't have the rights to make 9-11 audios). They're exactly like 1920s radio broadcasts, in which they're stories acted out by actors, specifically the actors that played each Doctor. My personal favorites, as you can tell by the flair, are the 8th Doctor audios, but they're all fantastic.

The best to listen to are probably Doctors 6-8, simply because they were each able to find a home with Big Finish after each having their respective careers as The Doctor cut unexpectedly short. Big Finish has been their big chance to really shine, and shine they have. Also, unlike classic Doctors in the TV shows, I believe the actors have much more say in their development of The Doctor, which has really shined through. In fact coming November, the 8th Doctor will be receiving a new costume in the audio adventures that was created by Paul McGann himself.

So, in a nutshell, they come highly recommended for me. If you want my honest opinion, I'd say go for the 8th Doctor.

When at uni, I used to feel jealous of the free trips that the international students got to go on. But I didn't feel I was being discriminated against.

I see nothing wrong in the occasional play centre catering only for mothers, if there is a local demand for it. I do think it's wrong for all parent and child services to cater only for mothers, as that would make it significantly more difficult to be a dad. Obviously a line has to be drawn somewhere, but I don't think we need to be so heavy handed as to ban mother-only services entirely.

That said, the article suggests that their isn't sufficient demand in the local area for the play centre to be mother only, and the people running it seem to be handling the issue badly. So I don't think this specific place should be mother only. I just disagree with the tone of most of the commenters here, that such a thing would be inherently wrong.

The laptop logo never bothered me - obviously they can't have real laptop companies, as it's a BBC production and any kind of product placement is banned.

true,michael_ellis_day,null,null,"I agree with the observation about Amy's house, but not about Rory's hospital badge.  There are frequent examples of typos and gross errors making their way into mock newspapers, magazines, ID badges et cetera on television shows and in movies (where the creators design the thing to be seen on a much bigger screen and expect it to be scrutinized more closely).  *These things just happen.*  

It's a different category of error from major set design.  A staircase in a constructed set is unlikely to have been an error.  But with an ID badge, the instruction to the BBC prop graphic designer could well have been ""run up a Royal Leadworth Hospital ID badge for Rory Williams.""  The graphic designer figures a DOB goes on such a badge, and makes one up to look right graphically...not realizing that it's going to be seen in close up.  Comes the shooting day, maybe someone looks at the prop badge and says ""Hang on, that date's wrong.""  Then someone else says ""We're on location, we need to get this shot in and we have six other ones to do before we lose the light.  The majority of viewers aren't going to be pressing their noses up against the screen to read the date, especially if it's only on screen for a few seconds.""  And the first one says ""You've never been on the Internet, have you, gov?""

People overestimate the omniscience of a television production when there are thousands of different things to keep track of, and people seem really reluctant to accept that a favorite show can also make simple mistakes.

Then he was knocked out, we don't know for how long, but long enough for River to chain him to a pipe and complete the device. After that, 10 stayed down there for a while pondering. Then he rejoined the others in the main hall, where he rejoined with Donna, they talked for a while and looked around. By the time they get to the balcony it starts to get dark again. And only after that does 10 rush with the screwdriver to the core to save River. Then he had to go back all the way to the TARDIS, where he stood in front of for some time and finally snapping his fingers and walking inside. I frankly don't think there was much time left.

Plus, brining River back could take a very long time depending on the method used. And judging by how realistic it would be if correct, it would have to be pretty advanced stuff. The Flesh has been suggested, but pure data into the Flesh has never even occurred on screen nor implied it's even possible at all. 

On top of that, why? Why would 11 do this? He cried when he knew it was the 'last night' (in his future(in a special)). Why would he do this if he intended to bring her back? I mean, he wouldn't give that screwdriver without thinking about exactly it would accomplish. Seeing as he cried, it means that it's truly the last time he sees her.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"About the 12 regeneration limit, or about the BBC never letting The Doctor die?

For the former, it's been a part of Doctor Who as far back as the 4th Doctor. Time Lords can only regenerate 12 times, giving them a total of 13 incarnations. After that, they can't regenerate and they die.

It is possible, however, for the high council to grant an extra cycle of regenerations, but it is unknown how they are capable of doing this. This has also lead to some confusion around here as people have taken this to mean that the high council had total control over the regeneration limit, and that it was enforced by their will. This is untrue as we've seen The Master himself try and gain new regeneration cycles behind the high council's back. Also, I think, it's a bit of a ridiculous notion that a group of people can just *command* people to live or die. They've also only been shown to be able to grant new cycles, not individual regenerations.

Long story short, there's no real precidence for the high council to have control over it, but for some reason people around here have insisted that The Doctor doesn't have to worry about a regeneration limit now that they're gone. This is just not suggested anywhere in Doctor Who, and has actually been shown to be false(River Song being burning through all of her own regenerations, for example). Moffat himself has also been set on record as saying that the writers will figure out a way around the regeneration limit when they get to it.

For the latter, that's just a fact of the nature of this kind of thing. It's a science fiction show that has a huge amount of fans(Just about all the writers now were fans of the show growing up) that will keep it alive, and it makes money for the BBC, so they will be interested in keeping it alive. Even if the BBC puts Doctor Who on another hiatus, I don't see it going anywhere in the long run.

Depending on the amounts involved I'd be happy for Tello to have a buy-back clause, provided we're in the CL before it gets activated (and for Barca to want him back he'd have to have developed to a level where he'd be a major player in getting us back into the CL). By then we should have the ability to sign other high calibre players, and we'll make a very tidy profit on Tello.

true,bcwalker,null,null,"Changing The Doctor is a big deal.  While he is not always the protagonist, the show does revolve around him and rest upon his shoulders to carry its dramatic or comedic weight, so whomever plays that part needs to be someone sufficiently skilled to do so as well as sufficient healthy in body and mind to do so throughout the shoot of a series.  This winnows casting decisions greatly right there, and so far we have three actors that did carry that load well, but we should not be cavalier about the matter.  The regeneration of The Doctor always means a severe change in direction, and is not to be done lightly.

Far, far better is to focus on changing the regular Companion(s) when looking to make a significant change before going for regeneration.  It is in the dynamic of the relationship between The Doctor and the prime Companion(s)--as of this post, Amy &amp; Rory--that the series gets both its mood and its theme, and thus its energy, from with individual stories varying this mixture to achieve specific, discreet results.

If refocusing a series' stories to or from a given creative direction is not enough to revive a flagging energy level, then it's usually a time to change the Companion(s).  This is, as I see it, the reason that Moffat decided that Amy &amp; Rory need to make their exit from the stage and end their time as the prime Companions on the show.  Once the new Companion comes aboard, the relationship between The Doctor and the new Companion (Yes, I know the character's name, and I look forward to seeing how this new one works.) will change the dynamic of the show and thus its energy.  Much like the TARDIS topping off at the rift in Cardiff, a change of Companions refuels the creative tanks and often sparks a renewed sense of vitality in the production.  (Barring any meddling from above, that is.)

So I hope that Matt Smith will stick around a little longer, and since we need not worry about that until...oh, this time next year or so (if there is any announcement, it will likely occur at the San Diego Comic-Con), we should just relax and gear up for our departure from the Ponds.",0,1344752632,null,0,false,0,c5rv9sk,t3_y202t,t1_c5rv9sk,t3_y202t,null,1429616388,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

3) Henderson will compete with Joe Allen for that 3rd midfield spot. We'll see the best of him. I think our strength will come from midfield. 
4) Walcott lags behind Adam Johnson in every relevant metric from EPLIndex.com. Walcott's pace is attractive, but his production is lacking. Walcott would still be a nice signing given the fact that it's hard to bring in players at this time, but if Johnson is to be had, he should be preferred. 
5) Any other year I'd say 4th (Tottenham isn't markedly better and Arsenal is um... Arsenal), but 6th is my prediction, but could easily be 5th. Rodgers needs a honeymoon year to sort everything out. It will be a difficult year, but one with a bright future ahead of it.

1) Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol' Janx Spirit.

2) Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V.

3) Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzene is lost).

4) Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it (in memory of all those happy Hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia).

5) Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qalactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark Qualactin Zones.

6) Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian suns deep into the heart of the drink.

7) Sprinkle Zamphuor.

8) Add an olive.

Drink . . . but *very carefully*.

£40m is a paltry sum of money frankly I'm surprised it's a low as it is, look at what china and America spend - if our spending could come even close to matching theirs, we could seriously begin to compete with them at the games in terms of overall number of medals and turning some of the silvers and bronze in to gold which I think should be a target for 2016 - turn 10 silvers in to gold and 10 bronze in to silver. Not bad for a country with a fraction of the population they have. 

£40m over 4 years really is a very small amount of money (how much did the MP expenses scandal come to in the end?) - the NHS spends something like £1bn a day. The better services you claim could be created through better costing and analysis of where that enormous budget is going.

I love Chris period, he brought a deep level to the Doctor, in a way. The point I'm trying to make is that I, like you, can't pick a favourite, which is a great thing, because I know some Whovians that refused to watch Doctor Who for the longest time after David regenerated into Matt because they were so in love with David as the Doctor, and it drove me nuts. The Whovians that have that amazing ability to love the show in and of itself, regardless of who is playing Who, means that, no matter who the actor is, they'll always love the show.

He's regarded as one of the great full-backs, but you wouldn't pick him if you were Hodging two banks of four.

With respect to Downing, I think that his pressing and defensive work were quite good last season, even when he was at his most hopeless in possession. Even so, it would require Agger and Lucas to be paying a little more attention on that side. That's OK, as long as the right side is a little more secure as it would be with Johnson or, at a pinch, Kelly.

Think back to our formation with Carra and Riise as full-backs: Riise was usually AWOL, but that was fine because Henchoz and Hyypia could slide over a few yards knowing that nobody was getting past Carra.

true,bleasy,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"They all give me the ""fuzzies"" inside. Nine showed that powerful yet extremely fierce character, without really trying, he is simply amazing, the fact that he does not have to be ferocious to strike fear into his enemies. 

Ten has so many qualities that highlight the Doctor's past, he has his tense, violent, brilliant, comical and serious moments and sums up all the emotions that the Doctor would feel after all that has happened considering what he had to do during the time war.

Eleven has evolved that comical yet serious side even more, his quirkiness and playful side allows the younger generations to connect with the Doctor. What really tops Eleven off is his childish nature with the TARDIS, when he scoots around the console and does his little quirks that make him so special makes me go funny inside. 

I believe that it is not only the Doctor himself and his qualities that allow him to be loved, but his love for his companions, what really gets me is the connection that Rose and Ten had, when they get split up tore me to shreds and was absolutely brutal, this is similar to Eleven and Amy, the relationship between the Doctor and his companion is also another aspect to take into account when someone chooses ""their"" Doctor.

With all that being said though, a lot of people forget that the Doctor existed before Nine, however some of these characters felt distant and hard to connect with, it felt as though the show was more about the sci-fi ad actual story line, whereas today's Doctors have become a more audience orientated character that still manages to have fascinating adventures that still engage the audience.

A great deal of goals conceded in the first half of last season came through set pieces - a problem I now consider to be fixed. On the other hand we don't pose much threat through set pieces either, so we'll struggle to pick up goals against the run of play. That puts more emphasis on our home form, where we'll look to control possession. Away wins will be rare. 

The league has a more direct look about it this season, especially with Allardyce and Coppell back in the Premiership. Even Arsenal have bought a target man. All teams pre-season should be practicing set pieces and organisation. Team ethic is hugely important - the big, direct teams will seek either to dominate or to frustrate, so we must be psychologically resilient enough to live with that. 

So my prediction is, loosely, we won't keep clean sheets when not playing well, especially away from home, but that we have enough about us to be above the scrap once we get to the end of the season.

I'm not having any of that. Two banks of four actually compensates for poor defenders by having them camp on their line and get plenty of cover from the wide midfielder in front of them, meaning that if they make a mistake they aren't conceding as much space or territory as would happen under Rodgers' system, where we're high up the pitch and would be very exposed to the counter.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; Where did you get £250m a year from? 

That was a mistake, I misinterpreted a previous BBC article, and I've corrected it now. On the other hand, your NHS figure is three times too high.

&gt; I see there is £40m coming from the exchequer, with the rest coming from lottery funding (and I imagine a fair wack will also now come from private sponsors after these games as well as well known sponsors like Nike, Adidas and dozens of others)

Lottery money is allocated by the Department for Culture, Media and Sports, so there's no reason they couldn't spend it on sports for the general population, rather than for a tiny cadre of prospective elite athletes. Clearly, if the money can come from commercial sponsors, that's great.

&gt; £40m is a paltry sum of money frankly I'm surprised it's a low as it is, look at what china and America spend

America actually spends no public money on Olympic athletics. They are [entirely reliant on sponsorship and private donations](http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2006/February/20060209164553jmnamdeirf0.9387018.html). On the other hand, China is a good example of exactly the wrong approach. Sports participation there is very low amongst the general population. The government funds academies which take athletic children out of school at a young age, and train them up specifically to win medals. In other words, their medal tally has no connection to health or athleticism in the general population, it is solely pursued for nationalistic or public relations purposes.

&gt; £40m over 4 years really is a very small amount of money (how much did the MP expenses scandal come to in the end?) - the NHS spends something like £1bn a day. The better services you claim could be created through better costing and analysis of where that enormous budget is going. Who's to say the lift in national sport this funding provides wouldn't help lower the NHS bill due to a healthier, fitter society. 

This is just political rhetoric. All opposition parties are very keen on making massive efficiency savings before they get into power. And about two weeks after getting in, they discover to everyone's shock that budgeting mostly isn't about magicking money out of thin air, but about spending priorities.

As I indicated above, I believe the money would be better spent on grass-roots sport or direct physical therapy, rather than on, to paraphrase, 'inspiring people to get off the sofa', especially when we have such a smorgasbord of high level sports occurring virtually every week. 

£125m could be spent on hiring an extra P.E. teacher for every secondary school in the country(*), or on building local swimming pools, or supporting local athletics clubs, or on bike lanes, or on hiring 3000 extra NHS physios, who could provide something like ten million extra physiotherapy appointments every year(#), to get the injured and unhealthy back to the level of activity which is necessary to maintain health, and to save the rest of us from future medical bills. In comparison, even more inspiration is not a worthwhile expenditure of funds.

(*)[4000 secondary schools](http://www.cilt.org.uk/home/research_and_statistics/statistics/secondary_statistics/secondary_schools_in_uk.aspx) at £30,000 per P.E. teacher.

(#)3000 physios paid 40,000 each, 16 half hour appointments a day for five days a week, gives 11.5 million appointments a year.

You sell everyone pretty short by assuming that everyone will just straight up forget what a state we're in because we did well at hosting and participating in a global sporting event. The apathy of the country over some of the issues we face was present well before the Olympics came to town, and that's as responsible as any fool of a politician for where we find ourselves. Maybe if people have a bit of pride and confidence in themselves and society, they'll actually give a shit about what's going on too.

I don't think hosting the Olympics was a great idea, and was incredibly put off by the heavy handed brand protection and such, only buying tickets with Visa that kind of thing. I can still see past those things and see a great event that brings the world together and inspires people to both work together and give 110% to themselves.

Seeing all the people who are *amazed* that we are third in the medal table is hilarious.  We were fourth in Beijing, behind Russia; we were tenth in Athens and Sydney.  What's happened in between?  Oh, yeah, we were hosting the Olympics and spent more and more money on training potential Olympiads, money that could have been spent reducing poverty or improving hospitals.

&gt;It is the greatest good to the fewest number of people which is the measure of right and wrong.

Did I quote that right?

It's the before and after that matter with things like the Olympic Games; the before has certainly been a complete disaster (not in terms of running a successful event but pretty much everything else) and the after doesn't look like it'll achieve anything except improving Team GB's training facilities and kicking poor people out of East London.

I wonder what would have happened if we had spent the same, or a slightly higher amount, on Team GB and *not* hosted the Olympics.  Would the papers still be full of Olympic news?  I think so.

true,nowonmai666,lfc99,null,"No, that's not at all what I'm suggesting. I'm saying that I think that under Rodgers's system, a full-back is not really a ""defender""; that his ability to move the ball, retain possession and achieve attacking penetration is what will be most valued. Defending is still important, but more in the sense of pressing (as is expected from the forwards) than marking. Stopping wide players is not solely the responsibility of the full-back as it is in a rigid 4-4-2.

Where you say that an attacking full-back needs to be an extra-good defender, I say that playing with attacking wing-backs requires mobile central defenders and an intelligent plan to cover counter attacks, whether it's a defensive midfielder who drops back as the central defenders move wide, or understanding between the wing-backs that if one goes, the other stays and everyone shuffles over 10 yards. In either case you effectively have a back three while in possession, which can revert to a back four when the full-back is back in possession. This kind of fluidity is essential if you want to commit players forward without emptying the midfield.

All the hot young managers are playing with some variation of this. Villas Boas is probably the best-known for having his centre-backs split and move wide while a defensive midfielder drops in (worked at Porto, failed with the muppets he had at Chelsea: that's why you saw so many players just running up the middle and scoring unchallenged), whereas in Thursday's game we saw a bit more of ""one stays, one goes"". I'm not sure how Rodgers will decide to manage this in the long term; it depends crucially on the mobility of the central defenders. Agger and Skrtel can do it all, Carra and Coates are better staying in position.

While it's true that more attacking fullbacks are covered by the CB's moving across (with the DM then dropping deep), I still don't think you can get away with using Downing there.

He seems like a nice guy with good intentions, but let's face it, he's not cut out for Liverpool. With Roger's system we need players who can hold the ball and just pass it about for hours on end if need be. Spearing is not that guy. I'd love to see him blossom, but it's not going to happen.

As for the others, I agree with the first choice covers. And Adam as a cover for Lucas should he require it, although Adam isn't as great as he seemed to be when he first joined.

I'd guess that Cole will either play out wide in the front 3 rather than an attacking midfield role, unless both Gerrard &amp; Shelvey were unavailable, although I'd love to see Suso being called up against weaker teams in that situation.",0,1344780543,null,0,false,0,c5ryd0p,t3_y2mhh,t1_c5ryd0p,t3_y2mhh,null,1429617851,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

I realise that people will still buy European cars but from experience I've always been better off buying Japanese.  I'd like to think that Britain could buck the trend here but doubt it.

The markets where European brands excel are primarily high end, while the German manufacturers may not be able to boast of the reliability they once did it's obvious that they're able to continue selling vehicles based on brand prestige and luxury, something Asia struggles with.  British car manufacturing is nearly all in this category save for the locally produced Honda and GM vehicles.  It's better to have a handful of Lotuses, Jaguars and niche sports car manufacturers etc than a few mass market low prestige manufacturers like France.

Iva's red card (and now subsequent 3 match ban) just reiterates our need to strengthen at RB. We *must* bring in someone before the window closes to cover situations like the present. 

Mikel was utterly dreadful today. I thought he had one of his better seasons last year, but it remains painfully obvious that his abilities are extremely limited. He's slow on the ball, passing ability is very weak, vision is terrible, link up play is non-existent and offers absolutely nothing going forward. He cannot continue to be first choice. 

Beyond this, I thought Torres looked great. Work rate was very high, pace looked great, hold up play was solid, linked well with others (see his touch to Sturridge that created the 2nd goal), his first touch was sublime and finish was clinical on his goal. I think consistent game time will allow him to find continuity to his game and could have a great year. 

PS: Sturridge's late contributions (however limited they were) were encouraging. He'll provide a great second option (assuming we don't bring in another striker, which still may be necessary) this year.

2. We could use a good and young prospect to cover at right back, but I'm really not too sold on any of the available options out there. Someone like Kyle Walker would be great.

He didn't scoop that one. It was JJetset long ago, and then every paper in the fucking land said we were signing him.

akqayid said Vertonghen was going to be paraded about with AVB probably a month before he actually got signed, and then every week he just kept saying stupid shit about why he hadn't been announced yet. 

Sigurdsson he also wasn't the first to break, that one was some random ITK who actually happened to be right (they usually aren't). Again, he just kept saying ""he's done"" for a week or so just like everyone else and it happened.

The only thing I think he was first with was AVB, and that's not even an impressive feat considering the limited spectrum of available managers at the time. JJetset also talked about people being unhappy with Harry long before he was sacked. 

Bale's contract I'll give him, he was really the only one who said anything about that. But it doesn't mean I'm going to start getting hot and bothered when he teases stuff, because this is also the guy who said Lass Diarra was coming (Lass said there were no negotiations at all) and teased myriad other targets that never panned out.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Leverkusen are like a mid-to-low table team in the Prem, so it was nice to see we dominated them, especially in the first half. Gives me confidence we can claim 3 points against the lower teams that we really should be beating.

Huge amount of possession in the first 45, obviously down to Gerrard, Lucas &amp; Shelvey. They played really well together and I hope that combo is used from time to time. 

Second half was a lot slower and quite frankly looked like a different team. A lot less possession, sloppy passing, awful set pieces from Adam &amp; a lot of poor tackling.

I was pleasantly surprised by Spearing. Although he didn't see the ball a lot, he didn't give it away much either, which is a nice change. I still don't think he fits in the team, but at least he wasn't god-awful like he has been.

Carroll doesn't fit. His goal was good, but he's not able to get onto the through balls like Suarez or Borini can. He'll be a decent back up, but certainly not my first choice. 

Shelvey looked out of place on the right wing, but he was great in the first half. 

Stirling was brilliant. Beautiful goal and I can see him scoring many more like that in the near future, just a shame he didn't see much of the ball.

In general the defence was good, especially as it was essentially our second-choice defence, bar Enrique in the first half. Coates made a few goofs in the 2nd half but everything else was solid.

Reina didn't have much to do. Didn't have a chance with Sam's goal, but gotta give credit to Sam, it was an incredible strike.

All in all it was a solid performance. Didn't enjoy the second half, at times we looked quite poor, but equally the Carroll goal was very nice to see. 

Can't wait until next week.

true,soccerholic1816,null,null,"My thoughts: We didn't play very well at all. It doesn't help that we were (justifiably) playing with 10 men for a lot of the match, but a lot of the players were making silly mistakes. We just didn't look sharp enough to challenge for a title.  
  
Lampard looked good for the most part, but we will need cover for him. Obviously this is part of the reason we bought Oscar, so hopefully he is as good as everyone thinks. Mikel looked awful, as he usually does. The few rare games he gives us don't justify being a starter. He doesn't match up well with Lampard either, because neither of them are going to be all over the place winning balls. Honestly Ramires should be our first choice in this position, and Romeu should be getting plenty of time as well.  
  
Ivanovic showcased why he will always be a step below the best, no matter how much we love him. He just doesn't have the speed/quickness to be a top class right-back. And from everything I've heard, Azpilicueta isn't really our caliber either. Debuchy or Piszczek anyone? Luiz is starting to look like he won't grow out of his rash and stupid decisions, and frankly, Cahill should be a clear starter over him.  
  
In attack, Torres looked pretty good today, and perhaps performed well enough that another striker isn't our priority. Hazard and Mata looked alright, but problems deeper in the midfield hurt their performances, and they also need to gel more. I'm not too worried about them. Ramires played alright, but he just isn't a winger, plain and simple. He won't be anywhere near as effective playing with Mata and Hazard as someone like Marin would, and he is much more useful in the center anyway.  
  
Overall, the sharpness of the team just needs to improve, and we'll really need to buy a first-choice RB and probably a first-choice RW as well. Debuchy is the obvious RB target, and as much as I don't really want to break the bank, Hulk is a good option at RW because he gives us that little bit of cover up front if we need it.  
  
Based on everything I've seen in preseason, my starting lineup would be:
Cech  
Debuchy - Cahill - Terry - Cole  
Ramires - Lampard  
Hulk - Mata - Hazard  
Torres

true,Dr_Prodigious,present,,"1. Piscezck: After today, it has become painfully obvious that we need a RB. Branna can fill in but he plays with the instincts of a CB, which costs us. Ferreira is old. We are mostly linked with Azpilicueta but I believe Dortmund's Piscezk is a much better option. He is great both defensively and offensively, and has been tested against some of the best. He might be expensive, but well worth it IMO.

2. Fellaini/Schweinsteiger: We need a proper holding midfielder. Mikel is good but very slow. His movements are sluggish and he lumbers his way with the ball. With all the attacking talent we have acquired, we need a deep holding midfielder that can quickly transition from defense to offense. Schweini would be a perfect fit, acting as both a holding midfielder AND a deep lying playmaker. However, I doubt Schweini is planning on leaving Munich. Fellaini is a good alternative.

3. Hulk/Schurrle: It would be incredibly foolish to rely on Torres to score goals for the entire season. Such a risk can backfire and destroy us. On the other hand, buying an all out attacker like Cavani would be expenisve and it would demoralize Torres. The best option is to buy an attacking player that is versatile and can play either on the wings or as a striker. Hulk and Schurrle fit this description well. Schurrle is the cheaper option, but Hulk offers a Plan B of pure strength.

true,not-really,null,null,"What we have is tribalism going overtly mainstream, propagated by a fawning media. Pride in waving a flag is a very peculiar past time and historically an act of spite if not out right warfare. It's what is done when an entity claims ownership of a conquered people, when you are first to the moon, first to the arctic, that kind of thing. It's inherently of monarchy. We have been persistently told that communism is a terrible thing, so I find it odd that such a collectivist activity should be seen as a good thing, even encouraged, especially one that is so overtly fascist.

I think Britain is so shockingly organised and structured if it takes something as meaninglessly extravagant (and short lived might I add) as the Olympics to create this 'feel good factor'. Would it be there if no one had won anything? Does that mean the psycho-social well-being of a large set of people is determined by numbers on a medal table? It's like a massive opiate making us forget about the many levels and social injustices that are happening. This is an engineering of false cheer behind quite an insidious and private interest that is the IOC. The masses are 'included' in terms of paying for it, but profit and law making has been privatised and monopolised. You might say Bradly Wiggins is a hero and you have some kind of personal relationship which might be true or false (certainly artificial for the majority), but it is all packaged with sponsors and private media (yes, the BBC is private in this context). Corporations have been put ahead of people at every stage, but oh look at the shiny things and cheering.

Just like in advertising where consumers are given irrational reasons to be seduced into the love of a product, the same has happened with the euphoria of the games. This is to the extent that people are warming to the idea of Boris as PM, all because he made a largely irrelevant speech prior to the games and stuck it to 'that guy'. It is not a coincidence that they play 'god save the queen' when some one 'wins'. We are suppose to idolise the protagonists purely because they created a sense of victory over a different set of people.

&gt; I just don't think we as a nation are a very ""wave a flag for no good reason or part of a specific context"" type of people.

I can name a few: jubilee, Olympics, that sort of thing.

 I think the only thing that *really* shows this out to be satire is that it was published in the Guardian, which would not have a journalist with such a ruthless and arrow-minded economic perspective on things.  If this was published in the Daily Fail however, it might not have been spotted as satire by anyone - and may actually have collected quite a large and passionate following of similarly minded people.

If we're really shedding 5 players, that gives us an additional (very conservative) 15MM, or 32.5MM + Luka.

If we buy a replacement CM for 20MM that gives us 27.5MM. If we buy Lloris that leaves 12.5MM.

true,MR777,null,null,"&gt;Why is French the first language of the Olympics?
At the opening ceremony, all the main speeches were first given in French, followed by English.
But why? Is it because French is still considered to be the language of diplomacy? For centuries, political delegates from around the world learned to speak French.
French was the first language of the Olympic movement - which is based in the French-speaking city of Lausanne - thanks to Frenchman Baron de Coubertin, who developed the modern Games in the 1890s.
Today, both English and French are official languages of the Olympics. At ceremonies French is spoken first, then English, then the language of the host nation. If it's an English-speaking country, it's just French first then English. If it's a French-speaking country, it's English first then French.

The issue is that when he gets the ball in our half (i.e. from a good defensive play or from our defense), his link up play with Mata/Hazard/Lamps/Ramires near the middle of the park doesn't work. This is essential to make defense into offense and start a smooth transition into a peroid of offensive pressure. A good example is Madrid. Their double pivot works well (Alonso and Khedira). Mikel either lost the ball or passed it away today. He kind of looked nervous even, with how slow he was to react a few times.

I didn't mean to suggest we should purchase someone new either. All I meant to say was that Mikel needs to be able to adjust and hence do well in more games.

We know that companies are paid to manage online identities, so that may have happened in this case. Second, people who love the olympics (and this extends to any tribe whether it be the monarchy, Labour, Arsenal, or whatever) are usually a devotee out of remote emotion reinforced by ritual and iconography (but probably mostly TV). They suffer pride all to easily, as that is what something like the olympics is all about. There is no other reason (although competitors and friends of competitors would have legitimacy).

true,ksturgis,null,null,"I honestly have to agree with Tesco on this one. Mikel has *never* been great at passing, regardless of what the stats say. His high passing rates are strictly bc he often plays shorts passes to teammates within 10 yards, and frequently passes back. If it were possible, I would love to see his passing % moving the ball forward. But to echo Tesco's sentiment, not only is he (at best) an average passer, he is **much** too slow on the ball. If we ever intend to have a fluid, free-flowing midfield Mikel cannot function within it. His vision is awful, and if he needs to complete a pass longer than 12 yards, he will give the ball away. And when he loses possesion, he is not quick enough to track back and help out on defense. 

 But his most egregious offense is how he breaks up our own attack. If we are quickly moving the ball up from the back and the ball comes to him, he simply takes far too much time on the ball and allows the defense to reset. Again, you'll often see him try to quickly get rid of the ball by dumping it off to whoever is closest to him, which is why his passing stats might not be so terrible (again, this is why stats can prove whatever you want them to). 

I honestly don't mean to be disrespectful, but I don't understand how you can claim to have watched him the last 6 years and not see his glaring faults. At the end of the day Mikel is a very solid DM. He provides great cover for the back 4 and is useful when we need to protect and lead and defend our area. But he offers **nothing** going forward, and in today's game, you can't expect a starting place in a top European club if your game is one-dimensional, which unfortunately defines Obi Mikel.

true,ksturgis,null,null,"Honestly I don't think anyone forgets that he had a decent season last year, but I would be remiss not to mention that his contributions were solely on the defensive end. Mikel has always provided solid cover in front of the back 4, and has definitely made the job easier for our defenders when going up against formidable attacking sides. 

But this aside, he is the definition of a one-dimensional player. He offers *nothing* going forward (and I truly do mean nothing). His passing is rubbish (I heard someone mention he's had a high passing rate, but this is very misleading as the majority of his passes are shorter than 10 yards, and he frequently passes back). His vision is even worse, as he often has his head down when on the ball. And he is *much* too slow when on the ball. He actually slows our attack when the ball comes to him. He has no shot (literally, him shooting is the fastest way to give possession to the other team). And if/when he does lose possession, he is very slow to track back. 

If we truly want to have a fluid, free-flowing midfield the ball must be able to move through him. The unfortunate truth is it doesn't. It often gets stuck with him. I'll leave you with this, can anyone *honestly* say that Mikel would have a cemented place in any other top club's starting XI? I don't see United, City, Barcelona, or Madrid having him anywhere near the starting XI.

true,sulta,k9,K-9,"While the Galaxy class starship is an excellent warship, it would stand no chance in a 1-on-1 fight with an Imperial-class Star-Destroyer.

 The Galaxy-class (The USS Enterprise) starship is a mere 650 meters long as opposed to the Imperial-class' massive 1600 meters (almost a mile long).

The Galaxy-class has either 12 or 14 phaser emitters and 2 torpedo bays, from which their complement of 250 antimatter torpedoes can be fired. This is all well and good, but the Imperial-class Star Destroyer has 60 heavy turbolasers, 60 ion-cannons (designed to disable critical systems on the opposing starship), 10 tractor beams and an assortment of smaller guns. 

The Star-Destroyer also has a flight deck where, at any time, 48 TIE starfighters and 12 TIE bombers are ready to fly out and take on anything and everything that gets in their way. The TIE starfighters are all without shielding or life-support, but each is equipped with 2 laser cannons and is extremely fast, reaching speed of up to 1200 kilometers per hour, four times that of the speed of sound.

With this in mind, I believe the Enterprise would be pulverized within minutes, despite its higher maneuverability.

A TARDIS, not being a military starship, can not be compared to the other two in this way. But a clever individual in posession of one could easily find a way to disable both of these great warships.",0,1344809949,null,0,false,0,c5s4ujp,t3_y3smp,t1_c5s4ujp,t3_y3smp,null,1429620968,36,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,36

true,ksturgis,null,null,"I'm not suggesting he needs to be an offensive force, but even Essien (in his day) wasn't just a solid DM, he could contribute at both ends. I apologize for the lengthy response, but want to address several issues I disagree with:

&gt;I also don't think we want our holding midfielders to be free-flowing.

This is just simply not true. All midfielders need to have the ability to have the play flow through them. If we *truly* only wanted mikel to shield the back 4, he wouldn't/shouldn't wonder beyond 35-40 yards out of our own goal. The problem is he is frequently at or beyond midfield as the play advances, and the ball finds him frequently when the attack builds from the back. This is where he wastes possession, slows the attack, and frequently misplaces passes. 

&gt;yes for that purpose, I do think he could start for United/City/Madrid

Absolutely not. For starters, Mikel would never be around Madrid's starting XI, United perhaps because their midfield is weaker than it has been in years (until they signed Kagawa, whom I think will be great). And Yaya often operates as cover at the back for city, and still has the ability to offer something on the offensive end.

&gt;Lampard makes for the perfect foil for Mikel next to him as he is everything Mikel is not

This is an awful strategy. To freely admit that Mikel is simply an extra defender on the field basically limits our midfield. Realistically it would only make sense to play him max 10 games a season (against top 5 sides home and away) as it is not necessary to field essentially 5 defensive players against the rest of the PL opposition. Not to mention if Lamps has an off game or is isolated by the opposition, we're now stuck with one midfielder capable of linking play between the back 4 and the front. He just limits our options with his inabilities. ",0,1344812995,null,0,false,0,c5s5kw5,t3_y3k0q,t1_c5s5kw5,t1_c5s58bb,null,1429621313,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

1. Does the doctor know enough about both ships to disable them. Probably yes. Even if he's never seen an exact model of the ship, he could still put together based on knoweldge of other ships how to defeat them.

2. Woudl the people on board be vulnerable to psychic paper. If so, it'd be pretty simple for him to sabotage the entire ship by acting as a sort of engine specialist. (of course, it would depend on the size of the crew. Idk enough about Star Trek or Star Wars to know the size of the crew on these ships. If it was only a small handful, it'd be more difficult to infiltrate, whereas a crew of thousends it would be very easy)

3. How the ""captains"" would react. obviously unless they wronged the doctor (and depending on the doctor), he would probably try to reason with them. On top of that, we could safely assume that none of the members of either universe know of time lords, thus even if they shot him dead when he tries to reason, they probably would just get rid of his body.

My biggest issue with him is that we don't seen any progress with his game he not getting better its just the same. I feel like if we watched clips from 2 years ago and then one from today we would  see the same mistakes being made. What kills me is he can be a world class dm when he puts his mind to it but he doesn't come into every game with that energy. I would pick up some one to push him like M'Vila if we could get him for around 8-10 mil. The thing with Mikel also is we don't have a midfielder who can come deep pick up the ball and get our attack flowing. Mata isn't well suited for it because he can get bullied off the ball. Lampard's skill set doesn't fit this need either so Mikel has to do it and just looks horrible about half the time and doesn't pick his head up to pick a pass that is more then 10 meters.

To be fair, many managers also played (and showed confidence in) Kalou and yet was still subsequently sold after 6 years. Just bc he's selected consistently over 6 years doesn't automatically mean he's top quality. I think without a doubt it would be accurate to say that over the course of his 6 years here he is more often than not considered a squad player. Since his arrival in 2006 he's averaged 21 league starts per season. He's never really been considered first choice except when Essien has been unavailable.

 He's good enough to be a squad player which is likely why he has not been sold. I wouldn't argue against retaining him as a squad player. My argument is simply he is not good enough to be a starter now that we are trying to cement ourselves as one of Europe's elite. I feel confident in saying that despite being 25, Mikel will never be Chelsea's prefered first choice DM, and as such, a replacement must be found. For now, I hope Romeu is given more opportunities to prove his worth and can hopefully flex in and out with Mikel all season long.

true,baltospeaks,lfc99,,"You ~~speak~~ type the truth. I'm far more excited about Henderson than either Spearing or Adam, and I hope both (or at least Adam) are moved on. 

Henderson fits the profile of what Rodgers wants in an attacking central midfielder -- he is quick and strong and fit. He makes decent passes and is content with retaining possession in the final third and looking for the final ball or the shot. He'll be much more effective than he was in Kenny's system. I still have no idea why Kenny thought he was a right midfielder.

However, I think Henderson should be on the bench, especially when compared with Allen. Allen is a ball winner and a deep lying playmaker, both of which Henderson is definitely not. I think we should groom Henderson and Shelvey to see which one will eventually be Gerrard's replacement while keeping Lucas and Allen as the other 2 central midfielders.

Now the galaxy class would have to contend with the offensive capabilities of the ISD. Some estimates put the lasers on the ISD at 30 TW range (possibly higher according to the people doing the calculations, but possibly lower based on their assumptions made).

We know the Enterprise can handle at least a couple photon torpedoes before shields fail. Therefore, the Enterprise would be able to withstand the bombardment from the ISD, with minimal, if any, damage sustained.

Makelele was.

Hence why, in an ideal situation, we would play Lampard, Makelele, Essien. 

Essien has never been a defensive midfielder. His passing is pretty average. For all his other talents, he couldn't dictate passing tempo to save his life.
