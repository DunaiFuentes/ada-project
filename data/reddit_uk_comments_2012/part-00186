true,pool92,lfc68,,"Time.

Rodgers is in the process of implementing his vision, technique, and philosophy. He needs time to carry this out. Shankley didn't built his team in a year let alone 6 months. 

Henry and the manager have a clear vision of how the club should move forward. LFC, as an organization, squandered the base that had been erected during the 70's and 80's. We were blessed with the boot room culture that delivered consistency: Paisley, Fagan, Dalglish, and the continuity of Shankley's footballing ethos.

However, we got 'knocked off the perch' eventually. Since then we have had the determination to be the best again, but not the vision or philosophy. Meanwhile, Man U persevered with a manager - who they considered firing - and have been extremely successful. 

We have a *rookie* owner (Henry is the driving power, thus owner rather than owners), and a young talented manager. They are bound to make mistakes. However there seems to be a focus finally. 

As a long time Liverpool die-hard, I feel this is the first time since the Shankley era that we are in a complete rebuilding process. There is actually a vision.

Cups:

League:

- i too see Everton and WBA falling down the standings, and it should be a battle between us and arse. I hope city and chelsea coukd drop a significant amount od points, and tbh i think it could happen, you mever know. We just have to be consistent and rotate rotate rotate. 

Squad:
- i love huddlestone, but he and all that you named have to leave if they want first team action. Gyfli should play more imo but let him earn his place. The rotation between sandro the beast and parker should be a smart one, and ofc im hoping for eriksen moutinho or sneider or even belhanda.

Really glad Lloris is here, i feel we are lucky to have him, but even happier Brad is staying on more year we need him as backup and he has a huge amount of experience.

Its attracting the wrong sort of people, and lets face it we dont want the riff raff knocking on the door. For example, you go out for a meal because you are hungry. You opt to buy an item in a shop because its cheap etc... I have never heard of someone saying ""Oh i need that book, but i am buying it there because i have to dress up as Noddy!"" or ""I only shop at Asda on Thursdays, as thats when we all have to hop whilst quoting the National Anthem in the voice of Joe Pasquale!""

What i am trying to say is drinking is a serious past time, some opt to sit in silence and focus on inner issues, observe the world around them. Others may just give the knowing nod from time to time. Whilst others enjoy airing their dirty linen. Then some prefer the talk on philosophy, sociology and psychology. Such as whats the point of Piers Morgan? Then some just want to drink like its going out of fashion. A pub is for these people. I am sure our mighty Zues ""The Pub Landlord"" will back me up here. Yes he tours the country preaching the ways of the mighty English boozer. He is the reason every pub jukebox must have Queen songs, and why fruit based drinks are served to the women.

What we need is good chat, people participating without the fear of being made to look stupid. After all we are all here for fun, not fighting. Whilst these ""Themed nights"" are to encourage fun, its only going to distract from drinking and chat. That is the greatest fun of all. Well apart from nudity. Oh and maybe sex. 

Actually i have slightly changed my tune. Unless these nights encourage nudity, such as ""Largest nipples night"", ""Pubic topiary championships"", ""Sexual Olympics"" then i shall not be taking part. Or observing. I would also like to make it clear that i am no pervert, or just hoping to catch a glimpse of some wonderfully fabulous boobs as they are paraded in my face, forcing me to motorboat them with glee.

Basically all I did was take both devices apart, make some space in the screwdriver, put the circuit board from the keyless entry button inside the screwdriver, wire the on switch for the screwdriver to the unlock/lock switch for the keyless entry, when I press the on button for the screwdriver, it also closes the keyless entry circuit.

* FA cup - a bit too early to tell. We should get through against Coventry, even if AVB decides to play some kids and squad players. Judging by our performance last year we could even lift it this year, who knows? 

* Europa League - I just see it as a bit of a bonus. Some exciting fixtures with the draw against Lyon and (possibly) Inter but I'd be surprised if we went the whole way. Just sit back and enjoy the ride, I say.

League:

* Top four was our aim at the start of the season, we're currently in the top four, so we're on track. At the start of the season I thought it would be us and the scum competing for fourth, and it looks like it will be. I think Everton have too thin a squad, especially considering they don't have the funds to reinforce in January without selling key players (Fellaini). West Brom will drop away too.

* We're great on the break but need to learn to break teams down when they camp out in their own half. Stoke sat back for 90 minutes and got a draw, we couldn't break Villa down in the first half and only scored in the second half when they decided to actually attack us. 

* There's been an improvement in recent games, but **we need to close out games after going ahead.** You all know the 80 minute stat so I won't repeat it.

Squad:

* Overall I'm happy. We have a settled way of playing and players who know their roles in the system. Most areas we have good depth in - particularly GK, CBs and CMs. We do not need a drastic overhaul in either personnel or style. What we do need is...

* **A fahckin' centre-forward!** Two strikers is simply not enough. Injuries, suspensions, Ade deciding to go to ACON - we are not far from having no-one to play up top. Llorente would be best, especially as he wants to leave and Athletic want to sell.

true,sickgrof,num10-away,,"Cups:

* Disappointed to be out of Carling, especially because of how we went out, but it might be a good thing in the long run...long run of matches coming up.

* Love that AVB is going after the Europa league. Even if it is second rate to the Champions league, it shows intent. We're going to be winners no matter where we are. Love it.

* Would love to see younger kids get some starts in the FA Cup, which we should be able to do in the first few rounds...would like to see players such as Townsend, Falque, Carroll, and A. Smith get starts.

League:

* I agree that West Brom and Everton will probably fall back. For West Brom, I think it'll be relatively soon; for Everton, I think they'll stick around until like the end of March.

* Can't really complain about where we are; we want top four and we're sitting in fourth right now. The only thing that people have to remember is that Chelsea is basically five points clear of us, because they didn't play their match home to Southampton. With that being said, we're only six points behind City for 2nd. Some non Spurs fans might laugh, but don't give up hope people. You all know the 80th minute stat and we've seemed to have fixed that up with Lloris and key players coming back from injury.

Squad:

* Would basically kill at this point to see Siggy get a run of starts. Every time he comes on as a sub our offense seems to blossom. He has that great instinct in the final third.

* Obviously Moutinho would be the ideal addition in January, and if that's not possible, most people would want us to go after Eriksen (I would be one of them), but a guy that I would love to see us get, who would be a bit cheaper, is Jordie Classie.

* Llorente would be a huge buy. If we were able to get Llorente, it would be easier for us to take both the Europa league and FA Cup seriously. We're one injury up top away from being in some serious trouble.

Overall, I think we're in a great position in both the league and Europa and can't wait to see how the 2nd half of the season unfolds. COYS!!!",0,1356702446,null,0,false,0,c7na4jd,t3_15jtge,t1_c7na4jd,t3_15jtge,null,1430790702,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,The-Darkest-Knight,num19,,"I think instead of just putting out the Starting XI we see fit, we should also consider the opposition. Sunderland's attacking is quick and efficient. Sessegnon, McClean, Johnson and Fletcher make for four players who are really quick and who will be very quick on the counter and with Fletcher up front, finishing isn't a problem for them. As a result of this, I think a back four of Walker - Caulker - Vertonghen - Naughton would work best. Gallas is going to be caught out by their speed. Aerially they aren't a huge threat so Dawson can stay on the bench and he isn't very quick either. We're going to need Naughton on the wing to match pace with Johnson. Bale will need to track back too.

Midfield, I think we've established that Lennon - Dembele - Sandro - Bale would be a good starting four with Dembele being subbed perhaps in the 70th minute for Parker even though I think it's time that AVB played them together at some point. Perhaps not yet. Maybe against the Reading game that chance can be taken. They don't have a lot of strength in the center of the park, Dembele could be key in this game.

Now for the front two. I know everyone wants Siggy in there, but with Cueller and O'Shea as CB's, I think Adebayor stands a chance aerially and through strength. I'd pick Defoe and Adebayor.

Add-on, I think we shouldn't take the Man City losing to Sunderland as a rock solid scale for the outcome of this game, Man City played a lot of cute football with Aguero-Tevez-Silva dinking the ball around and Sunderland had no-nonsense defending. We have a much more direct route to goal and I think they will fall because of the pace and straight approach we have. I think this could be another 3-0 or 4-0 victory. COYS.

We simply don't have the personnel to get the most out of the system.  This past weekend was a great illustration of that when our starting attack consisted of Suso, Shelvey, and Downing; then two impact subs when we needed goals were an aging Joe Cole and a relatively unproven kid who is barely 18.  First and foremost for this transfer window any type of creative forward players will be most welcomed be it an out and out striker so we can push Suarez out wide into space, where I think he personally belongs, some attacking threat from the wings that can come inside, or a CAM.  

In the long-term we're missing a Messi/Ben Arfa/Fabregas type player that can come inside and create like a false 9 role or score on their own, a creative mid-field player, and a few just out and out goal threats to come off the bench, start, rotate or whatever but just something so we have options.  I would say the only pieces we do have at the moment that don't need addressing are the defenders, CDM, and Suarez for whatever role he is asked to play leaving a good 6 or 7 gaps to be filled if you include having options on the bench.  Also the best case scenario is that some of the extremely talented players we do already have on the books grow, perform well, and improve such as Allen, Sterling, Suso, Henderson, Shelvey and some of the up and coming youngsters from the academy such as Morgan, Ibe etc.  Apart from that just I have to hit on the time thing again as so many of the goals we've given up have come from individual errors, losing the ball in bad places, and mistakes with defensive positioning all of which will hopefully improve as the players get more comfortable with their role in Rodger's new style.  

I personally don't see us going anywhere but up and hopefully this window coming up in a few days will be another step in the right direction!

You're right.  I don't think nailing people down to 'you must spend on this' is the answer of course.  and of course to deny people the right to even spend money on a bottle of wine for Christmas dinner is awful!

I don't know the answer, and maybe I was too hasty to jump in on the sledgehammer answer, but having experienced a lot of parents at our kids school who bend the benefits rules and cry poverty between puffs of a cigarette while tapping away on their iPad it's hard to remain civil.  Honestly, one parent I know complains weekly that she doesn't have enough money and yet she still managed to get to Silverstone for the Grand Prix!!  Her kids wear old shabby clothes and live in a shithole.

So it's not about 'only spend your money on this' but it's about ensuring that an appropriate sum of the benefits people receive is spent on their kids to give them the basic life requirements, healthy meals, clean and functional houses.

Firstly, alcohol is a luxury item. An item which does not contribute to a persons life, it is not required for a person to survive (there are special circumstances, ie alcohol dependency).

Secondly, this is not their money. I look at benefits as a short-term loan. It is money to live on whilst you look for a job, to then go onto pay taxes. 

If you have a friend ask for £20 because he needs it to survive and you give it to him, you expect him to spend it on the necessary items.  You do not expect him to go down to the pub and buy a round of drinks for him and his mates. I would call that taking the piss. This is how I believe the government is viewing the current situation.


There are people out there earning their money who would love to be able to afford luxuries such as alcohol, but they can't.

* The picture quality is very good even on upscaled programs

You make an interesting point, but without some form of mandatory (private?) savings/pension/health insurance scheme I don't think it would be workable - at least not for very long - and looking at the US model of health insurance and the number of people who have to rely on free clinics that would worry me.

Things like those you suggested were raised as ideas but as they're not ""blessed"" by the LEA we were never allowed to do them.

The headmaster retired recently and I know it was because despite his attempts to interact with the community and implement these kind of things he was constantly hammered down.  It was quite simply due to continuous calls for ""You're not doing enough!"" and then if we did the response was, if not total apathy, cries of ""Stop trying to tell us what to do!""

And so, the easy to control but minimal impact policies are put into play: ""No juice or crisps in lunches as it's unhealthy"", ""no football on the field as it's dangerous""...  Honestly these are all true examples of policies that were put in place as a procrastination from what really needs doing.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; We need world class players like Luis and Stevie to get back into Europe

False. Look at the Spurs squad that came 4th in 2009-10 (minimum 10 appearances):

GK - Gomes

DEF - Bale, Kaboul, Dawson, Corluka, Bassong, King, Assou-Ekotto, Hutton

MID - Bentley, Huddlestone, Lennon, Jenas, Palacios, Modric, Kranjcar

ST - Pavlyuchenko, Crouch, Gudjohnsen, Keane, Defoe

That squad doesn't scream out with many ""world-class"" players; remember at this point Bale was still a left-back, and a backup at that. Modric, really, is the only one at the level of Gerrard or Suarez. Dawson and King are great CB's, Defoe is a very good striker, and Crouch does his job very well. But really, it's not a squad peppered with world-class players that will only move to a CL club. Gudjohnsen was signed on a short-term loan and was already 32.

Crucially, it has two things our current squad doesn't - depth, and several 'solid' players - players who are effective at completing a given task. That includes people like Aaron Lennon, Assou-Ekotto, the above mentioned Defoe &amp; Crouch, Robbie Keane and Kranjcar. 

When you look at our squad for that level of players - not world-class, CL-only players, but solid players who do a job and contribute to the overall team, most of them are in the defensive roles in the team, and very few of them are in goalscoring or creative areas. We currently don't have anyone to chip in with 10 goals from wide areas like Kranjcar, or a backup striker like Robbie Keane.

So we don't need to chase after world-class players, and we don't need young players who might, after 2-3 years, become world-class players but right now aren't even good enough to reliably do a job for the team.

In my opinion he brings a level of grittiness and effort that Tottenham needs.  You put Dempsey and Parker on the same pitch and that gives us an extra layer of muscle and pressure/effort players that form a great foundation for our skill players.

Part of the negative sentiment is because he is replacing a beloved legend in Van der Vaart, who is one of the few world class players we've had recently (Bale, Berbatov and Modric being others).  Dempsey is not world class which some fans expect.

Also, he was brought in last minute as a replacement to another player (Moutinho) and is an older option to Sigurdsson (some people have high expectations on player development).  He was receiving a lot of minutes while trying to find his place in the squad (which takes time).

Personally, I've seen more from Dempsey than I have of Sigurdsson.  I think both are good players that bring different qualities to the team and need some time to blend in.

Dempsey was starting to play better but then was hurt.

1) According to the DW wiki, the GI was introduced in 1967. So, not exactly a recent villain. When you introduce (or in this case re-introduce) a villain into a self-contained narrative like a TV show, I feel you try to establish their danger and importance to our heroes, so the stakes are felt by the audience. When the agents of your main villain have only one establishing shot at the beginning of the episode, and then spend the rest of the episode suddenly appearing but never actually menacing our heroes (see: Vastra, Jenny and Strax's arrival - they appear to just walk through the field of snowmen, no combat or running sequences, or even the suggestive use of shadows), then the illusion of danger is almost completely removed. For contrast, look at the Library episodes - the enemy is the shadows, and every attempt is made to emphasize that, from the shots used to the actor's reaction. 

2) Batman's the hero but that doesn't mean Robin can't shine. 
If your episode's first half is mostly a stalking, sulking scarecrow being chased by a buxom governess, the comedy trio of Vastra, Jenny and Strax becomes even more important. At the very least, they're an awesome Greek chorus.

3) Why introduce a characteristic if you're not going to use it? Either explore it, explain it, or don't make a big deal of it. Time is too precious and a narrative too fragile to just throw out randomness.

4) Yeah, well, this one's an essay in itself.

Under Redknapp, Adebayor would receive a cross from Modric/VDV/Bale/Lennon and either shoot or square it.

Under AVB, Adebayor is a lanky midfielder who's job is to lay it on to Defoe. Suppose it's his own fault for taking such a long time not playing in the beginning, and Defoe scored again so will remain the focal point. It's a headache.

On top of this, Ade hasn't really linked up well with others up the pitch, which is meant to be an area he betters Defoe in. Contrasting Ade, Defoe often gets criticized for shooting too often but has already picked up 4 assists already whilst Ade has 0.

true,MNEman13,lfc68,,"I am the knob who made that post about [‘Shelvey being the biggest bum of all time’]( http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/15hdxj/shelvey_is_the_biggest_bum_of_all_time/) during halftime of Wednesday’s match. I was just going to let it die but I think I’ll take this moment to defend myself and to bring up an issue that I would like to hear r/LiverpoolFC’s opinion on.

I am not defending the criticism launched at him via twitter and Facebook, but I will begin with my personal reasons for disliking Shelvey:

**1:** I dislike Shelvey for his attitude on the pitch. I’ve been an amateur athlete my entire life and the greatest lesson I have learned is an appreciation for good sportsmanship. When Shelvey dives into a tackle with two feet off the ground, I do not applaud him for his passion or acquit him for making a mistake in the heat of the moment. Consistently making rash challenges as he does is the most disrespectful thing a player can do because it put’s an emphasis on over the health and future of a colleague. I do not know how r/LiverpoolFC feels about Shelvey’s aggressiveness, and I would assume that there are fans who applaud it. To those fans who consider it as one of Shelvey’s assets, I say to you: Would you cheer him if he was making those same tackles for another team and against LFC? Besides launching dangerous tackles, Shelvey often instigates or escalates verbal altercations with opponent players. Sticking up for your teammates is paramount and I have nothing against the pushing and shoving that occurs in the name of protecting one’s teammate, but when I watch Shelvey point a finger in someone’s face repeatedly I can’t help but feel like he is often the instigator.
**TL;DR** Shelvey frequently makes dangerous tackles and starts verbal arguments. Those two things are independent from his abilities as a soccer player and are the source of my discontent for him as an LFC player.

**2:** I do not rate him as a good player. He commits too many fouls, he has a terrible first touch, and he shoots from range with little-to-no accuracy thus causing us to lose unnecessarily. I would say his strongest attribute is his crossing accuracy and we’ve already got Steven Gerrard to distribute such long balls and switch the play. I would never include him in the first team and although it is wrong to dislike him for getting first team action, I think it is perfectly justifiable to dislike him based solely on a lack of ability.

I wouldn’t attack Shelvey or any player personally via twitter or his facebook unless they were consciously trying to undermine the club (which Shelvey is clearly not doing). However, I do think that it is completely ok to criticize him on a forum such as this one. Yes, my post was not constructive in the slightest, but it’s something I would say to my buddy at a bar. Regardless of how constructive the criticism is I feel like all fans and especially Liverpool fans have a tendency to hold double standard around criticizing their own players and I think that is wrong. In fact I would say it should be the opposite. Fans of a club should be MORE critical of their own players and demand a higher quality of play and sportsmanship. To illustrate this point: if Liverpool was a team of 11 men making terrible tackles and starting fights i.e. Wimbledon in the late 80’s I would have a hard time reconciling my support with the club with my own values of being a good role model for sportsmanship. This is especially important to an international fan like myself because I am not tied to this team geographically so have a tendency to I lean on the club’s scruples and passion when we suffer a particularly bad loss.

This brings me to my issue/question about supporting the players of one’s club. Do players have to earn the respect of the supporters or is it something they are given and can be lost. In my opinion respect it is something that players must earn, although as some people have pointed out, the club’s motto would seem to suggest they are given respect upon entering the LFC family. While there is a clear difference between having to earn respect and being openly disrespected, as my post was, I don’t think that a player should be disrespected for not having enough ability. On other hand, players who seem to not care about the club do open themselves up to such personal attacks from fans, and on that same point, it is equally justifiable to criticize players who do not treat their teammates or opponents with respect. YNWA is a beautiful and great motto and it’s one of the reasons I decided to support Liverpool seven years ago, but it should come as a contract: Try your best and be respectful and you’ll never walk alone. Maybe I’m wrong, and maybe it’s not my place as a young foreign fan to interpret the club’s motto but I stand by my opinions and will continue to strongly dislike Jonjo Shelvey until his attitude is changed dramatically. 

**TL;DR In my opinion Shelvey offers little in talent and is a bad sportsman. While I remain a supporter of LFC, I won’t let the motto YNWA be an excuse to tolerate such behavior.**

For a player to be bought or sold, the two stores must reach an agreement on a fee.  After the fee is agreed upon, another agreement must be reach on how much the player is to be paid for working at the new store.  If the player is unsatisfied with what he is offered, he can walk away.

While the skills are definitely there I think a lot of people have some unrealistic expectations about Dempsey just slotting right in and picking up where he left off at Fulham. Right before he got injured he had what was arguably his best couple of games in a Spurs shirt. 

So then there's the dilemma: Half the people expect him to be performing at the same level even though he is being used in a different manner, and the other half are upset because not playing Dempsey is automatically seen as a slight to American soccer and not as AVB trying to figure out what works best for the team.

Yes, if there was a Canadian on the team I would want him to get as much playing time as possible. But I think everyone needs to cool their jets on Dempsey, whether you're American and think he's the second coming of christ or you're British and won't give him a fair shake.

**TL;DR British: Give him a break and some time and he'll be a very effective player.**

true,Evis03,cnty-uk,Welshman-on-Mersey,"A life without any sort of luxuries is no life at all. Even prisoners get a television. The problem with this legislation is that it sets a precedent of denying people on benefits access to a luxury item. Tomorrow the argument will change to 'Why should they be allowed tobacco?' and then after that it will move further on.

You could say that's a slippery slope argument, but really precedents set in politics are very important. Even taken as just a proposal to ban alcohol with no pretense to anything else, why stop people spending at least some of their money on luxuries- be it DVDs, alcohol or books? If people don't enjoy themselves at least a little it leads to mental health issues which are bad enough for the individual, but also reduce their chances of finding a job.

Then there's the 'entitlement' argument. Why should a person who has paid enough of their national insurance to qualify for job seekers and is actively seeking other work be barred from purchasing something? If they are doing everything in their power to find work, why should they be arbitrarily punished by having a product withheld from them?

If you're 'getting drunk all the time' then odds are there's an addiction at work. If that's the case then banning these people from buying alcohol won't work as they will just turn to criminal activity to get hold of it. Prohibition doesn't work, it never has and likely never will.

We have a benefits system partly in order to ensure the desperate *don't* turn to criminal activity in order to get food on the table. In the above example this just pisses all over that particular benefit to society by creating a black market- and I doubt the people selling would be paying duty. Alliteratively you just send someone else to the offie to get the booze for you. Either way, it's pointless.

Bottom line, the legislation is self defeating, pointlessly unenforceable and arbitrarily punishing.

I couldn't help but chuckle at this one. We both know that when it comes to Doctor Who *everything* is going to change, and that's why I'm a bit concerned by it's retreading of old ground so much.

Doctor Who, or at least New Who, has always been about going out beyond the mundane and seeing the fantastic and the amazing. To always keep running forward and encountering strange new things. To embrace wild diversity and meet people from all over time and space. It's about understanding that everything has a point where it dies and that new things will always come along.

&gt; Seriously, this is nitpicking.

No, saying that the Doctor nagging Strax was horribly out of character or saying that Madame Vastra's make-up wasn't good enough for the extreme close-ups she got is nitpicking.

This is major. This is massive stuff that influences the entire direction of the show. This isn't just a tiny little niggle. This is a *huge* problem that will impact the show for *at least* a year and will have a massive impact on how the 50th Anniversary will pan out.

They don't even have to raise their own children because the state will pay for that too!

Please don't misunderstand me or think that I'm demonising all claimants. I know and fully appreciate that many claimants are genuine people who have fallen on hard times, but there IS a hard core that refuse to work and I can fully understand why.

&gt; Frankly, that's wrong and we as a society need to change that so that it's no longer an option to choose unemployment as a lifestyle choice.

There's a rotten bottom of the welfare state, I don't deny that, but I think it's overstated by the media. As many have said, far more people claiming benefits are working than not, and a large portion of those not working cannot find anything because of the economy. 

I've yet to hear any reasonable suggestions as to how those who prefer to be on benefits rather than work can be encouraged to do so. The point of the welfare state is to act as a safety net for the sick, elderly or otherwise unemployed - without means testing there is no way to separate the deserving from the undeserving, and such a process is degrading and dubious.

**Gonville and Caius**: Loves sport, quite medicine based the most traditional college if you want formality. BIC

**Clare**: Full of musicians. Very pretty. very friendly. Amazing English course.  BIC

**Clare Hall**: Graduate only. Not to be confused with Clare - although it did stem from Clare.

**Corpus**: Small and full of nerds ( apparently) BIC

**Churchill**: Very informal, but out of town, modern buildings. More science than arts based but only because it's near the science block.

**Christs**: Hard working, really friendly. Will push you hard. BIC

**Darwin**: Graduates only. Ecclectic. BIC

**Downing**: Neo Classical grounds, lots of lawyers, but not great 2nd and 3rd year Accommodation. 

**Emmanuel** ( Emma ): Really lovely - no one ever has bad things to say about it.BIC

**St Edmunds**: Postgrad and small 

**Fitzilliam**: Modern, ugly buildings but everyone loves it. Near to Churchill. Out of town however. 

**Girton**: Small trek as roughly 2 miles from city centre but beautiful grounds. 

**Homerton**: Full of teachers, next to a sixth form college but quite friendly still. 

**Hughes Hall**: Sporty, hidden from tourists and Mature students only. 

**Jesus**: Full of toffs. Sporty, have their own grounds and less tourists than other colleges. BIC

**St John's**. Collectively hated by all other colleges ""I'd rather go to Oxford than St John's"". Has reputation of being a bit of a toff college, but many people are lovely and not that bad at all. BIC

**King's**: Beautiful Architecture but many tourists. Is very informal if you prefer things to remain relaxed. BIC

**Lucy Cavendish**: For mature women only. 

**Magdalene** ( say maudalen ): Unique college, had an interesting rep before but very good now, slightly posh but not quite up there with John's and Trinity. Has most expensive ball going, only hosted once every two years and is White Tie. BIC

**Newnham**: Women only. Apparently full of lesbians and the grumpiest porters in cambridge BIC

**New Hall/Murray Edwards**: Women only, mildly pretentious as name got changed because someone donated a lot of money. 

**Pembroke**: Really friendly, very pretty, again no one has anything bad to say about Pembroke. BIC

**Peterhouse**: Allegedly full of gays, and smallest and oldest college in cambridge. Very pretty. BIC

**Queens'**: Quite artsy, and has some unique and ugly buildings within Cambridge. Great for open air plays in summer. BIC

**Robinson**: Newest College. Great if you like modernity and redbrick. Opposite UL. 

**Selwyn**: more religious students than most, love their drink and pretty buildings, near to UL.

**Sidney Sussex**: Outside Sainsbury's, small college, rep for having a great bar as student run and very community based. 

**Trinity**: Biggest and Richest college in either Ox or Cam. Can be quite pretentious but also beautiful. Roughly even divide between science and Arts. 

**Trinity Hall** Not Trinity, known as Lawyers college. Pretty but some accommodation is left next to Fitzwilliam, so not so great. 

**Wolfson**: Mature only, is very modern and almost americanised in it's layout. Deceptively close to centre of town.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"It's because employers have an abundance of skilled workers out of work. They don't want to train anyone. They want minimal cost at maximum gain, and that shuts out a lot of people. Equally, they want to avoid losing too much time on interviews, so they are only interviewing the people they think would stick around for a significant period of time on these jobs.

The days when you could apply for anything and get an interview are gone. If you have experience and qualifications clearly in a different sector, you're likely not going to get an interview because you clearly would go elsewhere if the opportunity arose. If you're over-experienced and the role is for a less experienced person, you likely won't get an interview because again, you would most likely want a more demanding and better paying role.

This fundamentally screws anyone who has experience as they are competing in a very large market of experienced individuals, whilst alternative roles are not an option because it's clear with most CVs what someone wants to do or is capable of doing.

I mean, to be blunt, businesses are not stupid. They know they can ask for pretty much any level of talent right now and are likely to find it because there have been a lot of redundancies and businesses closing down or purging staff with excellent skillsets. Why would they want to train up anyone from scratch?

It's on that angle that I feel the government needs to stop trying to press people into jobs and instead find ways to create meaningful experience and skills for people out of work because the employers simply don't want the majority of the workforce, and it's not necessarily the fault of those who are out of work. There's no profitability in a business over-extending themselves and risking going into administration.

Why isn't Ade getting these opportunities though?  I mean granted, he isn't nearly as scoring oriented as Defoe is, but he is a striker, who was our leading scorer last year.  Even Ade's hold up play recently hasn't been that great.  I agree that on their form, Ade is a better choice for us because of all his great attributes, but lately, he hasn't really shown them.  

At this, I think it is very important to also remember that AvB still has the media watching his every move for criticism.  At this point if he starts Ade over Defoe and Ade does poorly, they will say that Defoe has been stunning this year so far and that AvB made a huge mistake in taking out Defoe when he has been on a good scoring streak lately.  The guy did win the match for us against Villa.  I think that we start Defoe until he shows a drop in form, then start Ade.  Ade has not shown any reason that he should be starting at this point.  His touch has been off and he just hasn't contributed as much as Defoe.

The origin of the [Great Intelligence](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Intelligence), also known as Yog-Sothoth, according to the Doctor Who Wiki(which has been incorrectly updated to include the snow) is the following:

&gt; In the universe before the one of the Doctor's, Yog-Sothoth had a body that was a mass of tentacles and mouths. Like the other Old Ones, it may have lost its body when it ran from the Fendahl.

&gt; Afterwards, the Intelligence constantly sought physical form, but it did maintain a somewhat basic or simple manifestation.

The [Great Old Ones](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Old_One) origin is summarized as such:

&gt; According to the Time Lords, the beings that became known as the Old Ones did not originate from this Universe, but the one before it. They were originally a powerful race of beings who were the equivalent of the Time Lords in their native space. However, when their Universe ended, the Old Ones shunted themselves into a parallel dimension which collapsed seconds later into the new Universe. This allowed them to pass into the new Universe which had different laws of physics, and they discovered that they had gained god-like powers which allowed them to manipulate the new Universe in which they now existed.

So since The Great Intelligence is one of the Great Old Ones, we know that he(masculine voice, so going masculine) was born much earlier than Earth in the 1800's and somewhere outside of the universe.  That's the where and when of his origin.  The ""how"" is that incident with the Fendahl which led to them losing physical form.

The Snow began as just mirroring Simeon.  After years of having someone else's mind poured into it(between 0 and 50), it became self aware.  It gained sentience and as such became more than just mirroring.  It still played the part of puppet even though it was now able to pull the strings because it wanted a body, which Simeon was more than willing to provide.  Once Simeon was gone, the ""puppet"" tried to take over the now empty ""master"" because that was an in reach body that had a major connection to the snow(which likely makes it easier to take over).  This means we know the when(1800's), where(London, Earth), and the how(mirroring leading to sentience) of the snow.

Compare the two whens, wheres, and hows of their origins and you'll find them incompatible at a basic level.",0,1356722449,null,0,false,0,c7nevtc,t3_15kst8,t1_c7nevtc,t1_c7neji2,null,1430792941,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Bale easily could have played him in after drawing out Guzan, but he ran past Guzan pretty easily and scored a deserved goal.  Bale was in the right place for his other two and deserved to score those as well.  I think the problem is, you want him because he is excellent at holding up and distributing, but he hasn't been doing that very well lately.  If he had been, he certainly deserves more playing time, if not to start.  But because he hasn't you can't just start him over Defoe based upon what they can do, it is about the form they currently are in, and what that will result in.  

I completely agree that we should give him as much time as possible (especially as our lone forward), but he doesn't deserve to start over Defoe at the moment.  Now if Defoe doesn't score or appears to even be the least bit tired, subbing Ade on would be great, especially if he begins to pick up his form.  And if he does that, yes he deserves the start.  But at this current time in his current form compared to Defoe's current form, Defoe deserves to start.  It's a bit like the Lloris vs Friedel debate originally.

1. Several of the Great Old Ones have appeared throughout Earth's history at various points. It doesn't matter if they are much older than that, it's just when they got there. Like the Doctor said: ""This snow is new, possibly alien"". New as in new to the Earth, that is. It says nothing about its age.

2. The snow began with mirroring, yes. Because that's all it could do at that point. It was the only way it can somewhat manifest itself. However, this does not mean that that's all there is to it, though. It seemed more like it was taking advantage of the psychic snow, than being the psychic snow itself. But because he used the snow, it was also linked to his form. Which in turn made him vulnerable. And which is why he sought an unmelting body. 

Besides, the way he talked when Simeon was deleted was not consistent with what Simeon was like. It was far more playful and...condescending. It was more like House, than Simeon. 

I mean, how can something go from just mirroring to sentience? Unless the sentience itself is being mirrored...But we know that's not the case.

So dramatic. What, the ""excessive"" kissing and temporally time-space involved companion will affect the show? Yeah, it will. There will be kissing and there will be a big arc about a time-space event that will probably deal with the 50th anniversary.

Except that it's not. Like it or not, Doctor Who is *mainstream*. It caters to a large international audience and it's hitting number one on charts.

Call it pandering to the demographic but last I checked, an overwhelming majority of planet Earth's population likes kissing. And they don't mind the ""formulaic"" companion thing. That's just how Moffat runs his Who. He likes companions to be temporally involved. If you're worried about formula, good lord go harp on the Pokemon franchise.

You can dislike the formulaic companion thing and the excessive kissing but don't act like it's the beginning of the show's decline or that it's bad writing.

In January No clubs really want to sell as it disrupts your club and generally people want to buy your best players so often you end up paying over the odds, (Carroll 35 million)
However player who are in the last year of their contract may be sold in Jan as if they're not they can go for free in summer (Walcott) 
So generally January is more an opportunity to fix a certain area of your squad an offload players before they leave on a free or if they're surplus to requirements (Bentley)

It's my understanding, based on advice from a job centre member of staff, given to one of my colleagues at an appointment in an actual job centre, that at the time of writing you *can* be ""kicked off"" - either through ineptitude of staff who think it is mandatory and pass a sanction decision further up the chain, or if a jobseeker is told to hand over their Government Gateway I.D. via a Jobseeker's Direction, and fails to do so.

You're absolutely correct.

We appreciate that there is an inverse link between the time commitment involved in a job and the time available to spend with children, and it's something that we have thought about and no doubt will think about in a lot more detail when we decide that it's time to have children of our own.

That being said, we believe that there is a lot of benefit in demonstrating a strong work ethic to children and reinforcing the idea that nothing is free and that nobody is going to hand them anything on a plate; the idea that one needs to work hard in life for the things that one wants is something that we really do believe in.

true,Evis03,cnty-uk,Welshman-on-Mersey,"&gt;I understand that you think that if people do not have luxuries then they will suffer from mental health problems, but I just don't feel that is the case.

Spend three months without any form of luxury. No internet connection, no booze, no television, no cinema, no videogames, no books, no car (unless you live in the sticks), no weekend train trips, no take away meals- not one penny that isn't needed for your home, legal tithes and personal survival- then tell me it's not affecting you. 

&gt;We live in one of the most beautiful countries in the world - people come from all over the planet to see it. They come to see our countryside, our history and out culture and very little of that actually requires anything in the way of a ""luxury"" to experience and enjoy.
I can count so many things around me that would be free for a single person or a family to do and I utterly reject the idea that you need to spend money on luxuries to enjoy yourself or to entertain your family.


That wonderful country you want to look at? Unless you're willing to walk around nothing more than your own backyard, it takes money to get around and see it. It takes money to rent even a cheap hostel. It takes money to get a train ticket. It takes money to fuel the car. It takes money to obtain food while you're travelling. It costs money to get a pair of decent boots that are going to be useless in a job interview unless you're applying at Millets. Money that you don't *need* according to your logic, and is therefore a luxury. Why do you think tourism is such a profitable business? Because these very things are heavily monetized unless you're using nothing but your feet, and as I've said that means you exhaust your options pretty damn quickly.

And then there's time. Sight seeing is arguably one of the most time inefficient ways of enjoying yourself. There's a reason people will hike hours up a mountain on holiday, but won't visit the Ogwen Valley when they live a stone's throw from it. It's because it's quicker and often just as satisfying to put on Netflix. That means more time 'wasted' on luxuries and less time spent trying to get back into work.

And good luck with appreciating the beauty of this country if you live in a city. Occasionally you'll find some kick ass graffiti, but that's about it. Most of our urban 'cultural heritage' is also monetized to get cash from the toursits- requiring the spending of luxury money. You'll exhaust the free museums pretty quickly, even in London.

My main problem with the website can be summed up by the ten minutes I spent using our account to browse it. I applied via our ""Winston Smith"" account¹ for nineteen jobs in ten minutes.

Of those nineteen jobs, there were no contact details for eight of them. Eight jobs where I as a theoretical applicant didn't know who the generic CV we've got uploaded was being sent to, nor the name of the company, or even any specifics on the locale, other than a generic ""Town"".

I know you can request feedback, via the service, but that strikes me as a wee-bit, well, useless. And looking at it from a recruitment website - if I applied for that many jobs whilst on a tea break, imagine how many jobs a person could theoretically apply for in a 45 min internet session - now imagine everyone being mandated to use this system doing the same.

The theoretical usages of the site for fraudulent activities are well documented at this point, so I won't dwell on those - but suffice to say, it's alarming.

I haven't used it for a few weeks at this point - I'm back in work on the 4th, so it might have changed a bit since then, but the fact you couldn't at the time, include any form of customised cover letter / letter of introduction also seemed pretty silly.

You don't score 17 goals in the Prem (Primarily as a winger) unless you're a good player.

I was very happy when we snatched him from under the nose of Liverpool last minute and not just because we needed *someone* but because he has genuine quality and and seems like a nice guy.

I'm really happy for him to hit form recently, it must have been frustrating for him settling into a very different team. Not everyone can be like Dembélé and seamlessly fit into a new team. I'm equally disappointed that he has been injured recently, for him and for Spurs.

I get that American Spurs fans like him more than they would if he was a different nationality. It's no different to the amount of English fans that rave about Rooney, Gerrard, Lampard, Parker etc. This doesn't make a player overrated, there's nothing wrong with being proud of a player and their accomplishments because they are from your country.

Also, the idea of a rememberance tank was less often as a means to bring someone back, but more of a means to create a new person. I know that seems counter-intuitive but it's because we're stuck in linear time.

Faction Paradox was time-active, like the Time Lords, and so they didn't always meet in the right order. Thus you could meet someone, and then when the time comes, feed those memories into the tank, thus giving that person life, and that person will then go on to live out the experiences in the memories which you fed into the tank; literally the very same person from your memories.

In that sense, the person's entire existence would be a paradox, which I suspect is why it was Faction Paradox's preferred method of reproduction (if you can call it that).

If she cannot be classed as a permanent resident (which she almost definitely will) if she gets a European Health Insurance Card your wife can get any health care covered and it will be paid for by the French system. 

The [NHS website](http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/1087.aspx?CategoryID=68&amp;SubCategoryID=162) is reasonably easy to navigate so i'd advise checking it for any more questions. 

I don't know how much you know about the NHS but you will need to sign up with your local GP and you can go to them for minor things and prescriptions. Prescriptions cost £7.65 per prescription flat charge. Every dealing I have had with the NHS (fractured leg, torn muscle, a couple of prescriptions) have been good. The longest wait was on a Saturday night for my broken leg but that was 2 hours wait for the x-ray to become free which is not that unreasonable but boring when you can't walk around because you have a busted leg. If it had been painful no doubt they would have bumped me up but it was a hairline fracture that didn't hurt so they had to check it was even broken first. After that it was a 20 minute wait or so before they put a cast on me and I was out the door. The NHS should be free at point of use across the board and if its not then something's wrong. You don't need private insurance unless you want it for whatever reason. 

Don't know about any other stuff not being an architect but I would point out that London is a brilliant but very expensive place to live. If you haven't already check out rental prices. There is a lot on the news right now about how ridiculous the rental market is in London and how there are no affordable homes. I can only afford it being with several house mates and splitting the rent and even then its expensive. Also factor in transport prices - tube fairs are £1.90 one way on central london so a journey out and back on a night out or to get to work it will cost you £3.80. If you do that every day it will add up. Good luck anyway. ",0,1356731706,null,0,false,0,c7nhfzp,t3_15l56h,t1_c7nhfzp,t3_15l56h,null,1430794219,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

You seem to be interpreting my comment as a desire to deny people on benefits leisure activities, as if I'd prefer they went without the luxury of cable or satellite broadcasts even if it was financially unsound.

All I'm saying is that if you are experiencing sufficient financial hardship to legitimately justify access to social welfare, perhaps a paid subscription model is not the best choice for your television when the BBC/ITV/4/5 and their various additional channels among others are available on freeview. That's quite a lot of good quality content; about the only thing you really miss out on are foreign language channels and those dedicated to one thing or another such as movies or music.

Ultimately any attempt to micromanage what claimants spend their benefits would be highly unlikely to work in practice, but that doesn't mean there aren't choices that are sensible and choices that are not. With all due respect, you are not going to convince me that it is sensible to spend money on a luxury like that in a country with such good provision of free, public television when money is presumably tight. Plenty of working families don't have Sky or cable because they feel the costs are prohibitive.

But if people on JSA were, as is the proposal, to be banned from Sky, contract phones and other luxuries (indeed no TV at all due to needing to pay the license fee will at some point appear in this thread)... what about the newly unemployed who are still under contract? 

Any rules the DWP impose will not under any circumstance be malleable, JSA = cancel Sky contract NOW and show us proof of this or we won't pay your JSA.  It is the same with their current rules and procedures and there is no reason to suspect this hypothetical would be implemented any differently.

So the question still stands:  When Sky turn around and demand their early cancellation fee, who pays it?  The claimant themselves from their JSA or the DWP from it's budget?  Because ultimately should the government do this it will mean a lot of early cancellation fees from various companies. 

This is the minutia of what happens when the government wades in to these things and is IMHO far more important than the actual ""should they/shouldn't they"" that is going on. ",0,1356734684,null,0,false,0,c7ni7ev,t3_15klon,t1_c7ni7ev,t1_c7nhv15,null,1430794578,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Perhaps most important is that Oswin does not know she is a trap.

I get that everyone is getting worried they'll ""reveal"" his name, but I think they're reading too much into it. Have they ever said it was his name, or rather another part of his identity? Or will the fact that he keeps erasing himself from databases be a problem? I think they'll fix that at least, especially with the Daleks.

Sometimes the things we talk about in this subreddit are significant and interesting. But more and more nowadays I feel like the discussion here isn't what I'm looking for.

Problem he pointed out that I'm noticing a lot more nowadays is that people make all these criticisms and arguments and points about various aspects of the show, but they seem to be arguing their point to prove that X is bad or poor or not excellent.

true,dontgoatsemebro,null,null,"Ballistic missiles aproach their target from directly overhead. Aircraft carriers have [anti-missile cannons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_CIWS) and [anti-missile missiles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIM-116_Rolling_Airframe_Missile) and neither of them fire straight up, so they can't even be targetted. But even if they did they would be useless due to the velocity of a balistic missile, basically they're travelling so fast that by the time they're visible to the target it's physically impossible to shoot it down due to the low relative velocity of any projectile you can fire back at it.  
  
The current US defense strategy regarding the ballistic missile threat is that firstly; An enemy would have to know where it is, and secondly they would have to be able to hit it.  
  
So would a potential enemy be able to find it? A Carrier Strike Group comprises of an [aircraft carrier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimitz-class_aircraft_carrier) which is the size of three football pitches, several [cruisers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiser), a squadron of [destroyers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer) and frigates, and a small fleet of logistical and supply ships. Really, good luck hiding it. Ah, but would a potential enemy be able to hit it? Well... it is the size of three football pitches, so I think it might just be within the realms of possibility.  
  
As for our nuclear deterrant, the government *claimed* the warheads were designed and manufactured in the UK, but declassified US documents have shown that they are really a copy of an earlier US warhead. Regardless, the missiles *have* to be returned to the US every year to be kept running, so if we fall out with our friends across the pond our entire arsenal expires in under twelve months anyway.  
  
Ignoring the question of *who* we are deterring an attack from. The United States has enough of its own weapons deployed throughout Europe, including in our own country, to deter an attack. Why do we need to hold an expensive stockpile that is still beholden to the United States and therefore somewhat if not entirely redundant.  
  
&gt;""Under the terms of the missile lease arrangement, the United States does not have any veto on the use of British nuclear weapons, which the UK may launch independently.""  
  
They're nice words but they are just that. You can bet dollars to donuts that in the event that it was not in the US interest that we launch those missiles, they won't be going anywhere.

true,SplurgyA,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"There is a reason both ""verbose"" and ""pseudointellectual"" are negative words.

Your paragraph was very hard to understand; you repeated yourself quite a lot. I effectively had to ""translate"" it. This is what I assume you meant:

&gt;Would it be because there is a tendency amongst some people to view others as outlets for their sex drives? Normal individuals overcome this objectifying view because of a natural desire to fit into society. Perhaps rapists aren't able to articulate their emotions because society doesn't care about why they are rapists. We're too busy denouncing rapists as bad instead of analysing why they are rapists. So you're stuck with people who are fucked because nobody helps them.

If this is correct, well, that simply is not true. These adverts *are* looking at the reasons proto-rapists might become rapists and it is because of things like victim blaming demonising women, lad culture suggesting a passed out girl is fair game, misogynistic ideas about sex etc. etc. A lot of rapists are conditioned to think all men are rapists; there is an apocryphal story of a guy slipping a date rape drug into a drink in front of his mates whilst winking to them and then being shocked when everybody flipped the fuck out and stopped the girl getting date raped. Additionally, a lot of rapists do not think of what they do as ""rape"" - it is ""coercing her into sex"" or ""taking advantage of her"" or any other sort of mealy mouthed excuse.

These sorts of adverts are precisely what is needed, because although it might be ill advised for a girl to get super drunk at a party, it cannot be said to be her fault if she then gets raped... it is entirely the fault of the rapist. This is the approach that should be taken. The adverts show a reasonable person being able to step back and identify abusive behaviours; it is encouraging other potential abusers to do the same. The girl said no, he pressed on, but rational him realised this was wrong.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"&gt; I didn't say your opinion was invalid.

You may not have said ""your opinion was invalid"" (and I never claimed you said so much), but you did make no qualms about invalidating my opinion.

You said that my opinion had ""no point"" and that voicing it was ""nitpicking"". You never once accepted my opinion as being just as valid as yours, in fact you strongly voiced annoyance at me even voicing my opinion.

&gt; Because the things we discuss (to what end?)

All discussion (particularly those about the events of a object of pure entertainment) has exactly two goals: learning new perspectives and facets about the material and enjoying a shared fascination. I had presumed that (as in all discussions here) that this was a mutual goal between the two of us. Apparently you've perceived differently, but regardless I want you to know that my intentions are wholly benign; I do not want confrontation.

&gt;  feels like we're arguing little points to make a broader argument at large that the show is just going badly.

I think this is part of a larger issue, because you seem to be reading into what I'm saying far beyond reasonable, even going so far as putting words into my mouth.

For example:

&gt; don't act like it's the beginning of the show's decline [...] Doctor Who is not on the decline and it will not be cancelled for this

I never once in any of my posts insinuated that the show was on decline or that these issues would somehow cause it's cancellation.

I believe that you're projecting the sentiment of many other people squarely onto me and if you don't mind me being a bit blunt, I'm not cool with that happening.

I know that there are many people who will argue merely to prove a point and not to investigate or explore. I also know that those aren't my motives and it's not fair for you to presume that they are.

I understand that you and your informed and coherent friend have formed plenty of opinions about forums, and I totally respect that (in fact, I agree with a great deal of the conclusions you two seem to have come to) but please don't get defensive and dismissive with me just because I happen to agree with parts of the popular philosophy.

Just because I feel that Moffat repeating the exact same character over and over is a poor writing choice does not mean that I think the show's on the decline, nor do I think the show is somehow made awful because of this.",0,1356743796,null,0,false,0,c7nkece,t3_15jkrg,t1_c7nkece,t1_c7nja5x,null,1430795608,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

The people of these territories now have full British Citizenship, so can live in the UK if they wished to. The reverse is not true. However, it would be if all was merged. I'm sure living in Bermuda would be lovely! That is, until 60m people turned up out of the blue.

You lose the sense of local democracy as your rights, taxes &amp; domestic policy is dealt with overseas. Turks and Caicos had their self-governing revoked due to corruption a couple of years back. Imagine that on a permanent basis.

If you want a basis for comparison, check out the French. Their overseas territories ARE France, pretty much. Need a passport as it's not part of Schengen space, but you can work and live in those territories if you wished, as they are part of the EU.

The British Overseas Territories are not.

We didn't want to watch whatever shit was on channel 1 to 4 (later, 5), but with the all day children's programming, we were always content and didn't end up on the streets committing crimes as often as we did before we had Sky.

I agree that Freeview is probably a better solution now, especially given that 95% of the Sky programming is shit.

Also, please note that luxuries are a part of how people are expected to spend their benefits. The point of benefits is to ensure that people are above the poverty line, and a key part of being above it is basic access to human needs, and entertainment as well as luxuries are one of those needs. You probably will find a way to disagree, but do note that people need more than just food, water and a home if you want to keep them away from crime and disorder.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; However, in this world money is earned through our time and skills.

That's a very American, and unpleasant, view on money. Money is not that. It might typically be earned that way but money is very simply just a promise of value. A promise that can be exchanged for further value. Giving it to claimants is a way of giving the claimants value so that they can exchange that value for other things. 

Also, there is gain from the money, it is a social gain. Society is a valuable thing. Places with no society have nearly no economy (Somalia, an extreme example). Society is severely affected by the bottom of itself. Places with a huge lower class are negatively affected by it. We see the value in ensuring that all people meet a minimum life standard. That value is definitely realised in the UK by our high quality of life, life expectancy, and happiness. Those things have value, even to the economy, in the form of a strong, healthy and happy workforce.

Captain Jack notes that its bigger on the inside and the Doctor tell him ""You'd better be."" This is where the Doctor starts to feel responsible for Jack despite not approving of him entirely also starts to like him.

Donna bolts after learning about the size difference saying its ""too weird"" and she spends the rest of her time trying to go her own way. Despite her egarness at the start of the 4th series she not tied to his hip like many of the others. and they end with her *really* going their separate ways.

Wilf's first action is to make a joke but I think he suspected it would be something like that from when he spotted Donna and the Doctor with his telescope. So what I think he is asking is ""Your home shows that you weren't always so up tight whats changed?""

Amy realizes that she is nearly undressed in what appears to be the Doctor home. I think this is a hint at the innocence and trust that will form between them 

Rory's lack of surprise and basic understanding is his way of showing ""I am not your tin dog."" and it highlights an enmity so that they can overcome it to be greater friends. But Rory shows that he is ready to fight the Doctor on everything until the end of *The Girl Who Waited*

He lacks the acceleration to beat PL defenders so he makes up by running as fast as he could to try to nutmeg them or outpace them, however because he is running at full pace when he tries to shoot he is most likely to be a bit off-balanced, this also applies when he receives a scoring chance inside the box, he's probably ran 50 or so yards at full pace to get there that his legs are a tired and he couldn't get the full shooting action off, which results in poor accuracy. 

* Raheem Sterling - He's more of a winger than a forward, so its expected that he doesn't shoot that much in a match. When he is played on the right he rarely cuts inside, when he is played on the left he's shown that he is willing to cut inside and try to go for the top corner, however he's so lightweight that when he's about to shoot, any sort of pressure from oppositions will affect his shooting action, and also the accuracy of the shot. He's also been played as a forward in few of the games and has shown us that his finishing is still lacking a bit, however he's only 18 and most of the training he's doing is probably isn't finishing related.

* Steward Downing - Doesn't shoot if he's played at left winger, but he takes a few shots (and is pretty accurate) if he is played on the right. If he continues to play like he did the last couple of games and is not sold in January then hopefully he can chip in a few goals.

* Steven Gerrard - I think he tries to take less of those trademark long shots nowadays to prevent injury, and he isn't playing at the as far upfield (compared to a few years ago) so he has less chances, however he's still the best finisher in the current side. (which is sad really)

* Jonjo Shelvey - Not a bad player but Rodgers is playing him way too high up the pitch. He's constantly receiving balls with his back to defenders which is why his performance lately has dipped. But it still has to be said that he's shown that his finishing/composure is awful and he needs to improve on that. Having said that he's still young and up until now he's probably never been played in such advance positions before.


* Formation wise - When we play 4-2-3-1, you would expect the bulk of the shots to be made by the 4 players up-field, but we've never really played the correct players in those positions (sometimes due to injuries). Earlier in the season I felt that Sahin did a great job in that attacking midfield position, and that he seems far more composed the younger players, but since he's been injured we've played Shelvey in that position, and as stated above he's just not a good finisher. If Gerrard is played there I'm sure our shooting accuracy would improve greatly.

P.S. We've let Maxi and Dirk, i.e. our more composed forward players leave (and Carroll too), and replaced them with younger players that don't have much PL experience, so it could be said that its reasonable that our finishing/accuracy is so poor.",0,1356754946,null,0,false,0,c7nmzio,t3_15lmw2,t1_c7nmzio,t3_15lmw2,null,1430796903,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

true,Atomicide,num22,,"It's six of one, and half a dozen of the other. If you don't know what I mean, essentially both players offer solutions to the problems, just in different ways.

Playing against a fast defence? Adebayor is built to out muscle them, Defoe is built to match them for speed. Physical defence? Adebayor matches them, Defoe likely outruns them.

10 behind the ball? Defoe is the kind of player who can make something from nothing and cut them apart. Adebayor can give other players the space they need to work their own magic.

Are we struggling for goals? Adebayor can give us more control over a game by helping retain possession, Defoe can pop up with a goal from nowhere out of nothing.

Everyone seems to realise it's not working out fantastically at the minute with both playing, however if read the above, both players bring entirely different skill sets to the table. 

Theoretically they provide an incredible strikeforce. A big player who can create space for his smaller faster partner. One is good on low crosses to the front post, the other is a threat from high crosses to the back post. One player brings the wingers into the game, the other feeds off them.

I'm not sure why some people seem so set on breaking the two of them apart. We are still winning games with both of them upfront, it's a bit messy, but if they get it together and start working well with each other, then there is the potential for them to rip teams apart.

So many of them could become leading players if given the time and proper support, I personally believe BR with his experience and know how is the perfect man to do it although I think hes playing some players on the knowledge on what they could do and not what they can do now.

**what needs to happen/best scenario in 3 years time:**

* Id much rather see Gerrard go sooner than later..I know we all want him to play forever but Ive seen, time and time and time and time again legends that stick around and get played because there legends and they just become liabilities and trouble 

* Sterling has found his shooting legs, bulked up and combining his balance, speed and agility he's now a prolific player/goalscorer 

* Suso skill has caught up with his vision and although he's hasnt quite got the power to be an outstanding attacking midfielder his player making abilities make him one of the most effective players and tactical minds on the pitch (think Xabi)

This year, my uncle and aunt, who are sci-fi/comic book nerds, were in charge of getting mine and my brother's Christmas gifts, and they got me quite a few DW related items. I have been trying to turn my uncle on to the show for a while, but he hasn't got cable or Netflix, so it seemed impossible.

On Christmas day, however, there was a marathon on BBC America. I was watching it, and my uncle and aunt decided to join me. We ended up spending most of the day watching the past Christmas specials together as well as the new episodes, and they both were quite interested. I am gifting my uncle the Season 1 DVD as a late Christmas gift. 

Your situation is funny because you are an Aunt who is turning a Niece into a Whovian, whereas I am a Nephew who is turning an Uncle into a Whovian. All the same, best of luck!

true,Gettingworst,num26,,"It depends on the formation we play. If we're talking about playing a lone striker, I personally prefer Ade over Defoe. Defoe scored a lot of goals so far this season, but that's all down to other players keep giving him the chances, his general play is pretty poor and the amount of times he runs offside is down right ridiculous considering he's now 30 and should have learned to bend his runs a lot more to keep himself onside. His shot/goal ratio is not as good compared to other strikers, that's why he never got given a chance in the England team, because at the top level, you need strikers that can stick the ball in back of the net with just 1 single chance, Defoe generally need 3-4 shots before he can score one and that's being generous. 
Ade's lack of goals this season is down to AVB playing him in the support role of Defoe, he's not leading the line this season and play a lot deeper than I'd like to see. We need him to be the battering ram and hold the ball up to bring in other players into play in the final third.
At the moment, because we lack a creative midfielder, playing 2 up front is selling us short, I think we're better off just rotating the 2 and have siggy or dempsey to fill in the hole.

Big difference when you consider the replacements are on £20k - £35k and that even international rep replacements such as Sturridge will be on £60k.

We really should clear out all of those large contracts. There should be mid-table clubs that would be happy taking them on, putting them in the first team, paying £5-6M for them each.

I figure for Carroll, Downing and Henderson we could get £16-25M in transfer and free up £11.5M in wages, which works out to be a total of £60-70M saved over the next 3 years!

true,KidLiquorous,null,null,"I very much appreciate the allusion to ""Lost"" you made, as that was another show that intrigued and confused and amused viewers about 10% less than it disappointed them.
I must however disagree with the cynicism and seeming contempt you hold for Mr. Moffat's job as showrunner. I think it's natural for fans of any fictional construct to have a view in their heads of how said fiction should progress. I am definitely guilty of this at times. But, as unpopular as this opinion will definitely be, you are owed nothing by the men and women hired to craft the narrative of something you hold dear.
Doctor Who is a fiction. As with all good fiction and mythology, it's created to help us come to terms with bigger issues, all of which are grounded in humanity and the struggles it presents. I'm sorry if you (the impersonal you) get caught up in the meta-fiction the show is trying to present as being canonically inappropriate, or silly, or poorly realized. But Moffat makes the same sort of hand-wavey, sonic-like leaps of logic that are designed to fulfill the heart of the story, if not the brain.
Do I wish some of it made more sense? Definitely. Should we criticize, as fans, in hopes that our voices are heard and appropriate action is taken? Absolutely.
But to discredit the show and just wait until someone else takes over is a very empty solution. It's cynical. And it's incredibly un-Doctor-like (I'm a million percent aware that the Doctor is not real!). It's a story meant for children. It's supposed to appeal to whatever remaining vestiges of child-like wonder you	(the impersonal you) have. Is it too much to just ride the roller coaster?
Better yet, become a writer. Become a better writer than Moffat. Make the BETTER Doctor Who story, because the wonder of writing is that more stories always exist. But please don't just sit on the edges and cast aspersions. It's unbecoming.

true,MrXBob,null,null,"As people have said already, pretty much every TV remote control comes with red, blue, green and yellow buttons - this was because back before the Internet was popular, we had this service called **[teletext](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletext_Ltd)** where you could see news, weather, lottery results and play simple quiz games on your TV. It was free to everyone who could access it. I believe it was mostly shut down last year.

**[Here is an example](http://teletext.mb21.co.uk/images/ceefax-march-99.gif)** of a teletext style page - navigation was done with the four coloured buttons (usually shown as a text menu at the bottom of the screen) and by typing in 3 digits for the page you want to go to (you can see them by the side of each headline or category on that screenshot).

When Sky TV (satellite provider) launched their Digital service, they were able to add interactivity to some things. They had an entire **[interactive section](http://www.challenge.co.uk/Millionaire_freecredit_support.jpg)** where you could **[play](http://images.teamtalk.com/09/09/460x238/interactivecarparkgame8_2355265.jpg)** pretty decent **[2D games](http://images.digitalspy.co.uk/pacman.jpg)** (usually for a small fee via your phone line) with your remote control and use similar interfaces to view and rent Sky Box Office movies. Eventually other providers caught on, and so did regular channels - all starting to offer their own interactive services.

You get to them by pressing the red button on your remote control while watching their channels or certain shows. Usually indicated by the red button in the top right corner of the screen. Mostly, as people here have said, it's just things like extra behind the scenes bits or more information on the show. On BBC channels you could view all the headlines and weather etc - very much like teletext but with much more modern visuals.

The BBC always had the best content - for example after hosting special live gigs on Radio 1, they'd record them and show them in a loop on the red button. And with sporting events, the red button lets you choose the games/matches you want to see. It was especially brilliant for the Olympics this year, with all the sports going on at the same time the BBC had an entire section dedicated to live feeds of pretty much every single event as it happened, all with its own commentary. It also had a section where you could browse the medal winners and see stats from each country. 

This year though, the BBC seriously made the most of the red button service. You can now get access to BBC iPlayer from any BBC channel at any time by pressing your red button, it's brilliant stuff! I'm not sure how it looks on some other providers (Sky/Freeview etc) but right now on Virgin Media's TiVo service I get **[this](http://media.gizmodo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NEWS-bbc-red-button.jpg)** when pressing the red button - that's the normal menu where you can view news headlines and listen to the radio etc. 

If you then go to the iPlayer option, it jumps to the **[full screen browser/player](http://photos.pcpro.co.uk/images/front_picture_library_PC_Pro/dir_330/it_photo_165358_52.png)** where you get all the content that you'd expect from iPlayer on your PC or other device, in HD too!",0,1356782389,null,0,1356783247,0,c7nr9qb,t3_15lwlf,t1_c7nr9qb,t3_15lwlf,null,1430798912,17,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,17

Without Ramis, we've been forced to play Boycey out of position, and from the games I've watched, he doesn't seem comfortable playing there. With Boyce stepping back, we've had to play Ronnie Stam in the faint hope that he'll figure out how to cross one day.

For instance look at Rome, Rome was barbaric had slavery war death all over the place we ourselves where conquered. And, yet do I think Rome should ever say sorry? No, because that's how it was at the time. I also think the negatives of the Romans is far out weighed by the advancement of Europe that they brought.

Probably my biggest disappointment with Rodgers has been how he's played Sahin &amp; Gerrard out of position / with the wrong personnel. Gerrard is our best attacking midfielder, and the signings of Sahin &amp; Allen, and Henderson's development, mean that his defensive prowess is no longer an absolute necessity (as was the case last year when Lucas was injured). Sahin isn't an attacking midfielder, and when he has played as a regista he hasn't had adequate defensive cover beside him (to be fair, Lucas has mostly been injured).

Bale needs to stop drifting in, when he is in the centre of the pitch it's real easy for defenders to group up around him and crowd him out of the game.

Sunderland also seem to be crowding out Sandro, which is something you rarely see, and I think this is having an effect on our game, but nobody is noticing.

Having said that, I caught a bit of Alan Carr and Dara O'Brien recently. Not my favourite, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed them both. Especially considering how much I can't stand Carr normally.

I like Jimoein atm. Al Murray can be good. Being an East Ender, always had a place in my heart for Micky Flanaghan. Don't mind Stewart Lee.

There's a couple more but I can't remember. Jack Dee always amazes me how he's been around for so long and still managing to pump out reasonable material because most comics go stale quite quickly.

if hitler had won the war, do you think it would've been fine for germans of 2012 to look back upon the holocaust and say: ""hey, well look at rome, you've gotta break a few eggs to make an omelette""? 

you can justify any action with that line of reasoning if you choose to accept it. that line of reasoning needs to be permanently tempered by discussions of what is actually moral, otherwise you end up killing any notion of morality because it can all be justified retroactively.

India’s habit of obstruction at the WTO is a clue to this: Indian farmers are more numerous and protected than French ones. “To form a formal trade block would be difficult,” Mr Sharma says politely. “Because where is the commonality?”*

Similar to say the diverse economies of Europe, Spain's heavily tourism based economy, Lithuania's labour and manufacturing based economy, the UK's financial based economy, I thought ""united in diversity"" was the whole point of the EU, crediting this as something to go against a union is quiet contradictory.

*""Yet there is a problem. Britain and its close Commonwealth allies, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, provide over two-thirds of the Commonwealth’s running costs—but they cannot reform the Commonwealth. The club works on the basis of consensus, and almost any suggestion they make is liable to draw allegations of neo-colonialism. This is most evident in their separate efforts to promote so-called Commonwealth values. Over half of Commonwealth members use capital punishment; many African ones retain anti-sodomy laws. A recent British-led effort to institute a Commonwealth commissioner on human rights, democracy and the rule of law was shot down by Nigeria and Sri Lanka, backed by India and South Africa""*

Well this also applied to the EU, not so long ago most european nations used capital punishment, we created the European Parliament and created cross national laws which most had consensus on. Again to assume the commonwealth of which has stronger political binding than the EU historically would not do the same is absurd.

Overall the article is amusing primarily due to the lack of evidence to disclaim how a commonwealth union would be a failure, overall such a union would share a lot of traits of the EU yet combine people who speak the same language in their economic and social circles, share common history (in a better way unlike say Germany and France) and who would likely consent to such a union being formed (unlike the EU which has mutated over the years into a federal state).

Under British occupancy it's public health, improved industrialisation and improved agriculture resulted in a boom of population. Today thanks to those improvements India is predicted to become a superpower and plays an increasingly large role on the world stage. Could they have done so without the British Empire? I honestly cannot say, however if you compare to the other nations around it the outlook is not so great. Was it worth the famine?

Personally I would consider myself a Unionist with a 'small u'. I would vote to keep NI as part of the United Kingdom, because I identify more with British culture and things, but I personally believe that we are best the way we are because it is a compromise. No one decision is going to please everyone, so for the mean time the status quo is the best way forward. But its a personal matter and I think that  a free vote is the only fair way.

The UK Youth Parliament has no legislative powers as such, rather its MYPs work with the MPs and MLAs of the area to lobby on issues and work with organisations to initiate change. We represent and give a voice to the young people of our area

I would normally side with a ref and say if they really cannot see it they cannot give it. However in this case if he couldn't see the incident, then he has no right to book Bale for diving either.

Edit: I see quite a few people saying it wasn't a foul or a booking. To be fair it should have been one or the other. However the only reason it shouldn't have been a booking is because the referee clearly didn't have a good view if he missed both the arm and knee contact, therefore was not in a position to make a judgement like that.

If the referee was in a proper position to view the incident, then really it has to either be a penalty and a card for the defender, or the attacker being booked for diving.

Dempsey came on for Defoe and made an instant impact, and if Adebayor was on scoring form it would  have been a huge impact.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I work in the food industry, and thus is my qualification to answer your question...

Beer bottle caps are simply stamped from a long roll of steel, Very simple process, minimal machinery to do so, and as you can transport a big long roll of sheet metal to be pressed on site, reduces costs. The bottles with which they work are also a simple design. 

For 'twist off' caps, my understanding is that the manufacturing of the caps is more complex than a normal pry-off cap, that and the bottle needs a different neck design/shape than a normal bottle. 

So to implement, it would mean a big change of equipment / bottle moulds / processes, and to some extent, culture - How often do you grab a beer bottle and try and twist the cap off? All of those things take time and money, which is likely not worth the investment for an ""if it aint broke"" type problem. 

Add into the fact that twist-off caps have a poorer seal efficiency (i.e. more bottles fail to seal properly with a twist off than a pry off), then you have product losses too. Again, costing time and money. (Source; Info from home-brewers, extrapolated)

That would be my thought, anyway.

For another example to illustrate. You've probably seen on the internet examples of Coke-Can concept designs, such as [this shape, to stop the can rolling](http://designyoutrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/coca-cola_1.jpg) or [this embossed version](http://editorial.designtaxi.com/news-coke310512/1.jpg).

Neither of these have made it to market. [The process of making a aluminium can](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7Y0zAzoggY) is so precise, automated and machine driven, that to implement a change such as the anti-roll can, would require entirely new machinery and new processes, which would ultimately see the price point of that can rise significantly.

**tl;dr: The cost of retrofitting equipment and process to do this is quite high. Cost of bottles would go up.**

And I think the problem a lot of us had with the Stoke game was that we didn't just lose, like 1-0 or 2-1, we got beaten up 3-1, with our only goal coming from a penalty. I don't think we've let Stoke score 3 goals in a long, long, time.

We played absolutely rubbish, actually. It was worse than against Villa, in my opinion. We dominated for quite a bit of the game against Villa, while against Stoke we never ever looked in control. Our players were making elementary mistakes - misplacing simple passes, getting pushed off the ball too easily, losing the man they should be marking, etc. Also, it just seemed that our players didn't even care, nobody chased down the ball or closed them down when Stoke received the ball, except Suarez. But he can only do so much.

I think Fellaini would be a great replacement for Frank Lampard and really help the younger Belgiums we have in the squad blend in. Plus he has been playing in the PL for some time now and would require no settling in.

Falcao every fan would love but I don't think it will happen this transfer window. With Torres finding his form again I don't think Abramovich will withdraw another 50M from the bank for him. It's more likely that we will  sign a back up striker or hopefully recall Lukaku.

As for the players going out.

I want to keep Frank Lampard. He has so much experiance and has probably been the best attacking Midfielder to play in the Premier League. He could teach a lot of youth so much.

Ashley Cole is still the best Left back around and is also needed. There's not many players that can go straight in and replace him. 

Malouda and Benayoun we don't need.

On a serious note. Buy a DM, temporary or permanent we need one that needs a high work-rate. 

I think everyone has forgotten how important and good Mikel is in the double-pivot since we're all circlejerking around Romeu and Luiz. Just . . .  no, not yet. Luiz gets injured or booked, we're kinda screwed when it comes to games we still need to play.

A lot of good DM's or decent ones just aren't available this window it seems, or at the least, they'll be expensive as hell.

Miguel Veloso - Busquets - Fellani spring to mind. However, one team is at the most competitive it has been for years with the manager unlikely to sell him, one player just moved to bumfuck middle of nowhere Ukraine this year, and I highly doubt the other one will be sold due to him being an integral part of the team.

Looks like we'll be shelling out for some talent in the midfeild. However, we can just put Oscar on a fuckton of protein shakes.

No.  Wearing a cycle helmet will help, yes, in a very limited set of circumstances - if I get splattered in a head-on smash between a multi-ton truck doing 50 mph and me on my bike, I ain't walking away from that no matter what is on my skull - your point is accepted.

But if I'm putting a child onto a bike I'm also putting a helmet on its head.  Not because I'm expecting a car to mount the pavement, but because I'm expecting the child to fall off, at least in the early stages of learning to ride.  And it would be the height of arrogance for me to say that I am then excluded from those same rules - I might not have fallen off my bike for a few years now, but when I do, and if I hit my head, I'd prefer something covering my skull.

Perhaps in future decades people will look back in horror at the very idea of not wearing a safety helmet, in the same way we look back with abhorrence at how children were sent up chimneys to clean them.  We live and learn, and society changes.

true,[deleted],null,null,"To be honest. I was expecting at least 7 points from the last 3 games. Villa have conceded 15 goals in 3 games without any response, Southampton are outplaying Stoke physically and technically at the moment. The Fulham result and performance met expectations.

We should have been aiming with 60 points this season. Even if we don't quite get that, we'd probably end up in a similar position to last season despite a change of manager and personnel. On track for 52 points isn't good enough. Travelling away to any team without expecting some sort of result, isn't good enough. 

This isn't a criticism of Rodgers, this is a warranted criticism of poor performances in the hope that we learn from our mistakes. We've found ourselves within touching distance of the Champions league spots a couple of times this season but our form has left us meandering between top and bottom half of the table. Not good enough!

This is a transition season. We've dropped points through our lack of flexibility though. I really appreciate and enjoy the style of football we're trying to play, but we aren't Barcelona! We don't have Iniesta, Messi and Fabergas, we have Allen, Downing and Gerrard. These players are good at doing what British players do, which is creating chances on the counter attack and playing rigid football at times. We played too deep without much purposeful passing against Villa, we just didn't battle physically with Stoke. The best teams in England score scrappy goals and defend like Sunday league players when it matters.

In The Doctor's Wife, the personified Tardis says she take the Doctor where he needs to go:

---IDRIS: And you have? 

---DOCTOR: You didn't always take me where I wanted to go. 

---IDRIS: No, but I always took you where you needed to go. 

And since the Tardis ""exists across all space and time"" she would both know that the Doctor needed someone like Clara/Oswin AND where exactly to take the Doctor to find here.

I leave open the possibility that the Tardis had a more active role in Oswin's fate.  For example, the Tardis could have saved Oswin from the exploding asylum and taken her to be relocated to 19th century, Victorian England.

As far as a message, I found it was a commentary on how people view ""success"" in the lives of celebrities.  Coogan is ostensibly the most successful, with his Hollywood career, the parties with the upper circles, and his celebrity girlfriend; but when you look beyond the impressions and the public image, the only real difference between them is that Brydon is happy and settled in his home-life, with his wife and children (and perhaps a more regular career performing in front of a ""home"" [UK] audience).  Coogan does proudly try to deny this by proving to Brydon that he is a better quality impressionist and comedian, and a more successful celebrity; but ultimately, with both men know in their middle-ages, Coogan has realised that his lofty ideals of ""quality work"" alongside A-list celebrities and the accompanying high-roller lifestyle just can't compete with Brydon's loving family and arguable position as a loveable and regular (if less successful) British TV celebrity.

The guy has been in tech longer than you've probably been alive. Yes, he promoted digg v4, but *who the hell cares*? It wasn't his company, and it wasn't really his call.

And you worked this out, how exactly? Something like 50% of our imports are from the EU, but we pay 51million pounds a day for the privilege. You're telling me to pay some tax on the EU on the goods we import we come in at over 51million pounds a day? 

We'd actually be financially better off. 

On another note, leaving the EU which is actively dictating to Greece and weaker memberstates economically, and militarily.. would this not fit the liberal ideology this website adheres to?

Think about it, if we're out of the EU we're free to set up free trade agreements with the rest of the international market, which is a hell of a lot bigger. Infact the commonwealth may indeed WANT a free trade agreement with us, India would have to adhere to certain regulations obviously, but we could even push for free rights to immigration in the memberstates of the commonwealth. 

Getting swamped with apologetic Canadians who are more culturally akin to us, and Aussie women who are just absolutely gorgeous, with similar powers economically wouldn't be as detrimental as letting unskilled Eastern Europeans in.

This would actually shine brightly on us. Give us, as British citizens better options to immigrate ourselves, rather than it being much of a one sided deal. Who wants to immigrate somewhere with a much lower standard of life anyway? Or somewhere with a similar quality of life, but doesn't speak our native tongue? 

It just seems common sense to try and push for better integration in the commonwealth rather than the EU. UKip are in favour of this too, see /r/ukipparty if you're interested.  ",0,1356805002,null,0,false,0,c7nuvru,t3_15mh25,t1_c7nuvru,t1_c7nrxpc,null,1430800697,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

Every time Stoke played a high ball into the box, the defence looked precarious. We couldn't compete in that area and Stoke exploited that so effectively. Liverpool tried to play tiki-taka that way BR wants the team to play, but it was difficult because Stoke was in our faces, pressing even our CBs. Our game was disrupted. At that point, it wasn't about mentality, it was about tactics.

We don't dictate how the game plays out. BR needed to be more tactically astute to nullify the threat Stoke possessed. It's all well and good to want a team to play a certain way but we're not there yet. Stoke has been playing the way they have for how many years now and have continuously built on that getting taller, stronger, physical players to help strengthen their style of play even further.

true,JvvB126,logo,From Wigan,"Well, that 3-0 was a good start. It'll hopefully give us more confidence, especially as we play Manutd next.

Having Caldwell, Ramis and (hopefully,) Alcaraz back will be a huge boost to our defence. Not to mention that, but as you saw today, Boycey can get back on the wing, where I've been really impressed with him. Much better than Stam, because he can run past defenders, cross and score! (woop)

Beausejour needs to put some practice in on his crosses, he's still over-hitting them and because of the amount of possession he gets, it's vital that he plays well.

Although we won today, and although we still had 2 blatant penalties shrugged off (wat...), I was still a bit disappointed with our possession at times. We'd just end up losing the ball in silly situations, and then have to defend for another 2 minutes before we got it back (and lost it again).

I guess the good thing is that even though we didn't play as well as I think we can (for parts of the game, anyway), we got the three points which we haven't in other games.

I'm hoping that we'll make a few signings in January too. Another striker would be good as we'll lose Kone while he's at the Africa Cup of Nations, I think we've been looking for someone from Leeds and a youngster from Man Utd. Espinoza will give us a boost to midfield.

[Napoleonic Wars?](http://en.wipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_War) Nope. Loads of allies on our side.

[American War of Independance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_American_Independence) Fought that one solo. Lost. Woops.

[War of the Spanish Succession?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Spanish_Succession) Nope, we even had Zee Germanz on our side there.

[Anglo-Dutch Wars?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Dutch_Wars) Only the 4th went decently in our favour and we had allies, and they'd already effectively conquered us by then. Well, we like to think we ""invited"" William of Orange over and ""offered"" him the throne. But the fact is, he had an army and we didn't put up a fight...

[30 Years War?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War) Nope, part of a large alliance.

[Italian Wars?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Wars) Well the name gives it away doesn't it? Part of a large alliance again.

[100 Years War?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_years_war) Nope, *and we still lost*.

Actually it turns out that out of the wars I've heard of where we fought solo *and won*, all are lovely little imperial conquests, like the [Anglo-Zanzibar War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Zanzibar_War). Hardly great military victories when you turn up with gunboats and superior technology and crush the hapless natives for daring to disobey.

Now don't get me wrong, Britain has had some brilliant military achievements, but major ones, like Trafalgar, Waterloo, Blenheim, D-Day, the North Africa Campaign etc, all took place against a backdrop where we had a great many allies on our side. Criticising the yanks for 'never winning a war by themselves' is just jingoistic drivel; There are plenty of wars we fought by ourselves and lost, and by my quick straw poll, it seems all the major wars we fought and won, we won with allies at our side.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ok...thank you very much Sir or mamn'.  This is exactly the type of answer I was looking for.  Your ending was interesting, Dickens over the American dream, because (and this may be a bit simplistic) I've watched every episode of Top Gear, and any time American television is mentioned, its about the celebrity nature of it. In particular I remember the episode where they went to New York and the first person to get to the station got to be on ""American Television"".  It was a big deal to them, especially Hammond, the Secret American. It was a hilariously brilliant satirical riff on American TV when it turned out to be a shit local access TV station. To me that's American television in general; there's so much hype about it, but the actual substance tends to be shit.  The problem is that so many in the American public are complacent about it.  That's about to change though, I believe.  It turns out this whole internet thing isn't just a fad, and people roughly my age (I'm 22) have access to things like hulu and Netflix, which means we can watch other content than American television.  For instance, I mentioned Top Gear, but I'm also a huge Dr. Who fan, just finished the U.K. The Office, and will probably start watching Torchwood soon.  What I like about British television is that, while the stars are obviously celebrities, the celebrity isn't celebrated nearly as much, thus the focus is more on the content, on substance and not style.  I really believe that, as my generation grows older, you will start to see a shift in American television towards the kind of substance you see in British television...although it will remain fundamentally American in nature, much like the two versions of The Office as a perfect example.",0,1356809252,null,0,false,0,c7nvylo,t3_15lwuc,t1_c7nvylo,t1_c7nu2h4,null,1430801187,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Even if a majority of people in the UK wanted to do it, you'd also need popular consent in every other nation in this new international organisation.

In general the Commonwealth nations seem quite content for it to be a loose organisation of friendship rather than any sort of political union. I also suspect that in the specific case of Canada it'd step on NAFTA's toes, which the U.S. and Mexico probably wouldn't be too happy about, and while we might not care about that Canadians rightly would.

Furthermore, while euro-skeptics like to bandy around the idea of an EU exit, we're so tightly bound up in the community both politically, economically, and legally that actually doing so would be unfeasibly difficult in practice, and it's questionable whether another international organisation with such a similar role could overlap given the supremacy of EU law at the domestic level of each Member State in areas of community competence.

&gt;By the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, s. 15
Passing, tending, or delivering counterfeit currency is an offence. Passing can mean giving or, of course, spending. Where the delivering of the currency is done with no intent that someone else is using it, i.e. by someone who is simply carrying it for someone else to a destination, the offence is less serious and can only result in a maximum of two years imprisonment, although the sentence may not even be a prison sentence. Where there is an intent that someone else should use the currency afterwards, the maximum sentence in the Crown Court is ten years.

&gt;For these offences to be proven,the defendant must know or believe that the item is counterfeit. Suspicion that it may be fake is not enough for a conviction to happen.

He knows something is comming for him and ge doesn't want Rory and Amy to get caught up in it.

I don't think it is to draw comparisons in terms of playing style or statistics, just the kind of impact a person can have on a club specifically and the game in general as an influential and likable personality. In the end, Zola and Mata are both individuals living in different eras, under different circumstances. Greatness lies not in a number or style of play or even success, greatness is a very abstract and hard to achieve milestone in life. If someone thinks you are as great for this era as someone else was for his own era, they're not putting you under a shadow, they're making a pedestal for that person equally as high as the player in the past. Maybe someday people will be drawing comparisons between future players and the Messis and Matas of today, but I think it doesn't undermine the player as an individual living in the present, it just presents the player with a quantitative abstract greatness that lies in the hearts and minds of the fans. At the end of the day there is no ""as great as"" or ""greater than"" or ""greatest"", Mata will be Mata, as good as Mata, and be as important for this club as Mata in this time and day, but to be compared to a past legend should only be a matter of pride and future determination to earn more plaudits.

Your mistake here is that you've blamed a system for individual errors.  How many of those set piece goals were because the system failed and how many were because players lost concentration and didn't implement it properly?

Both Ajax goals were because Yaya wasn't concentrating.  The goals today were the same or lucky bounces.

There's no problem with zonal marking, no problem with our set piece routines and no problem with the manager's focus on them. There's a problem that we've seen all season, all over the pitch,  that the players do not keep their concentration levels high for 90 minutes.  Even then, this isn't really a ""problem"" as it isn't majorly costing us but is a bit of a small concern that we could do with working out.

Every time we fail to win 4-0 and I come here, I see the same threads; people who have little idea blaming everything and everybody in some overdramatic tantrum where every one thing is suddenly a pattern that needs urgently addressing.  If I wanted to read that, I'd read Bluemoon.

We're fine.  We're playing ok and picking up points.  We might win the title, we might not.  Nobody is sacking anybody or selling anybody off the back of one season, it's the progression of the Club since 2008 that's the important thing and we continue to progress on and off the pitch.  The squad we have is young and full of talent.  The manager we have is young and full of talent.  The technical people at the Club are young and full of talent.

Perhaps so, but many (esp. the French) won't be so receptive to those damn rosbifs trying to have their cake and eat it too.

The USA would certainly support it, but a France-dominated EU (which is what would happen without the UK) would almost definitely move towards a more protectionist stance (just imagine every EU policy turning into something like the CAP).

&gt; An atheist shocked Muslim volunteers at a stall promoting Islam when he ripped out pages from the Koran. Peter James Crawford (52) then threw the holy book onto the ground and told them: ""Your religion is a load of b******s.""

&gt; He is on trial at Leicester Crown Court accused of causing religiously aggravated intentional harassment, alarm or distress, by demonstrating hostility based on membership of a particular religious group, Islam. He denies the charge.

So no, it isn't a blasphemy trial: the court takes no stance on whether or not Islam is true or false, the issue at hand is an aggressive action directed at another person. 

I'm not sure what kind of democracy we'd have left if we decided that one person had every right to rip up books belonging to other people, books which those people consider sacred, just because the ripper-upper considers those books to be 'a load of bollocks'. 

*Edit* I think the paper editorialising to call this guy 'Atheist Peter Crawford' is a bit suspect. It basically suggests that his actions stem from his theological position or group membership, which isn't terribly fair on other atheists, and also turns it into a story about a man doing something on principle instead of a man being anti-social, when it's not yet clear which of these it actually was.

1) I think that we actually have quite a good education system, especially at primary level. We came out best in Europe at Primary Maths and did very well in english as well. 

The education system needs to become a bit more flexible. At the minute the very nature of the GCSE system means you are almost forced to choose a career you want at 15, and if not things will be very difficult when you pick the 'wrong subjects'. So maybe something along the lines of the International Baccalaureate would be beneficial. But i think the UK's new policy of removing all modules is a wrong move. 

Beyond this, maybe raising awareness of alternative options beyond staying on in school, such as apprenticeships etc. But essentially more flexibility to suit individual people and their combinations is needed. 

2) I would improve the times of Busses. Have them run at more even times, on the hour, and spread out more evenly. It does not make sense to me to have 3/4 busses to a destination in the space of an hour and then none for an hour or two more. 

I would raise the age at which an 'adult' fare kicks in to be 18. Its absolutely ridiculous that a 16/17 year old, who likely isn't working, and likely isn't old enough to drive be forced to pay £12 to Belfast and back, or £6.50 to Downpatrick return. As I've said in my Manifesto, 16/17 year olds are in an 'in between age'. Too young to drive, but old enough to want independence from their parents. This makes us some of the most likely to use public transport. 

I would improve and clarify the timetables online, making them easier to access and check etc. The translink website is kinda awful, and info can be hard to find. Same goes for fares. Maybe an app or something?

Lots of little things if I had the power. Clean up the busses. Follow Scotland's lead and put bins on them. Cut down on paper waste by only printing tickets for return trips. And on the return trips, make use of that paper by printing the departure times of the bus home on the reverse.

Perhaps the Tardis has created Clara at different points in the time line because it wants the Doctor to keep travelling?  I can't think of any other mechanism for having the same person live and die through history.  Perhaps the Clara in Asylum was the original.  The Tardis understands that the Doctor liked her and it's created a wild goose chase to persuade him to start running.  The Soufless and the ""run you clever boy"" and ""remember me"" seem like deliberate hints.

Then again, maybe the ""remember me"" is the clue.  Perhaps Clara has to remembered like the Doctor had to be remembered in The Big Bang.  Somebody mentioned how the Tardis reacted when Clara touched it, but I have no idea what that means.  She appears to pursue the Doctor fearlessly and in a determined way.  She seems unconcerned by all the alien technology.

When she first walks into the Tardis she's saying ""For your information, I'm not sweet on the inside and I'm certainly not little"".  That certainly sounds like a Tardis.

The nanocloud is limited to the Asylum and possibly some other Dalek owned places. 

Plus, I don't think the TARDIS can just zap people from wherever she likes to wherever she likes. An emergency temporal shift seems more likely, but then she'd  be a Dalek stuck in the middle of god knows where. 

On top of that, the nanocloud never did a full conversion like that. From the footage we saw, that's done by hand, manually.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"Well my post kind of makes it out to like the people dislike learning languages but whilst I think some people do have those problems it's mostly do to with us having a terrible way of teaching languages.

I did a foreign language at school for a while and didn't get anywhere ether, but recently I took it upon myself to learn German and using nothing but online resources ^(seriously, you would be amazed of the quality of some of it. It's free too.) I've gotten to a competent level.

Ich lerne deutsch am Internet für fünf Monate. Meine Österreichisch Freund sagt ""Du bist okay für fünf Monaten"". Ich weiß ich viel praxis muss. ^(Yes I'm full aware there are lots of mistakes)

My sister is the same but *much* further ahead.

What I'm trying to get at is foreign languages aren't taught effectively in the UK. Not necessarily through fault of teachers but through faults of timetabling, ie not giving enough time to actually learn it. There's also the sieve nature of schooling which is detrimental to languages. What I mean by that is that the teacher will move on through the curriculum  and a reasonable pace whilst dispensing information for the pupils and hoping it sticks. If it doesn't stick, just hope enough does for them to pass an exam. You can get by doing that in some subjects but not language.

I'm sure I've bored you enough now. That's my hypothesis on the matter. If we reformed education ^(which I would like it to do any way, even if languages are missed *entirely* it's about time it was reformed) we would be able to get better language taught and make much better use out of the EU. Not just the political side, but the economic and importantly the cultural.

true,ProtoKun7,smith,Smith,"Amy, Rory and River were invited to Utah to meet the Doctor, where he was shot and evidently killed by a mysterious individual in an astronaut suit.

They then met the past Doctor and went to 1969 in which they engineered the eradication of the Silence by manipulating the moon landing footage.

After going to an old acid-mining monastery which used Flesh technology in its early stages, Amy turned out to be a Flesh avatar with her real (pregnant) self controlling it but captive at Demon's Run. The baby was born and later revealed to be River Song (then named Melody Pond). With help from the Doctor's allies, Demon's Run was taken over and Amy was rescued, but baby River was taken by Madame Kovarian and raised with the intention of killing the Doctor. She escaped the suit as a child and made it into the slums of New York, where she regenerated into ""Mels"", Amy's and Rory's childhood school friend.

She grew up and met the Doctor in a corn field, where they travelled to Nazi Berlin, 1938, and a fatal gunshot wound caused her to regenerate into her ""River Song"" form. Still brainwashed, she made numerous attempts to kill the Doctor, culminating in successfully poisoning him with a compound from the ""Judas tree"" contained in her lipstick. It resulted in a very temporary death, where after a change of heart she cured him by pouring the rest of her regeneration energy into him to save his life. He left her a diary during her convalescence, after which she began her studies at Luna University. During their time in Berlin, they also encountered a shape-shifting robot craft called the Teselecta, which enacted its own form of justice by removing criminals near the end of their timelines and torturing them. The Teselecta had information on the Doctor's death, which intrigued him and he eventually downloaded the relevant information, which told him his recorded date and place of death.

The Doctor later left Amy and Rory on Earth for them to live a ""normal"" life and travelled on his own for 200 years (but with several encounters with River, which she documented) before meeting up with Craig Owens again, defeating a group of Cybermen in the process. Then we see that River, who has just received her Doctorate in Archaeology is approached again by Kovarian and captured, placed in the spacesuit once again, under Lake Silencio.

Finally, we see Earth, 22nd April 2011, 17:02, in such a way as the date and time are constant. We then are shown flashbacks of the Doctor's later travels gaining more information about the nature of The Silence and why he has to die, in which he hears of how at the fields of Trenzalore, at a time where none are able to answer falsely or fail to answer, a question (namely, Doctor who?) is asked and that The Silence believes that question must never be answered.

It takes the Doctor the news of the death of one of his oldest friends, Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart, for him to realise that everyone's time comes eventually and he prepares to face his demise.

We then are shown again the events of episode 1; the invitations are sent using the stationery from Craig's house, his friends assemble at the lakeside (when they meet he is wearing the Stetson that Craig gave him) and he once again approaches the lake, and talks to the past River in the suit. This time, however, there's a difference. River regains control and fires her suit's weapons, but away from the Doctor, draining the suit's power and causing all manner of trouble in the process, as she has just changed a fixed point in time.

This is what causes time to collapse into one moment, on one day, where all of history is happening. Charles Dickens is giving interviews on BBC News, Pterodactyls are considered pests and are flying around Hyde Park, and the Wars of the Roses are still going for a second year. The Doctor is recalling all of this to Emperor Winston Churchill until they realise they are surrounded by Silence. Amy then enters the building with a team, stuns the Doctor with a gunshot and takes him on a train to Area 52, where he changes and she shows that she still remembers the way things are supposed to be though she doesn't quite remember Rory; she recalls him vaguely but not his appearance. He is currently under her command known simply as ""Captain Williams"". When they arrive at Area 52, the Doctor is supplied with an ""eye drive"" which records information about the Silence, enabling people to remember them. They meet up with River and the now captive Kovarian and discover that being at opposite poles of the disturbance, if River and the Doctor touch, time begins to progress normally again.

Every Silent suddenly breaks out of their holding cell (which never really posed them any problems; they were merely being patient) and storm the area, with the eye drives causing electrical shocks to everyone wearing them, causing pain or death (Kovarian dies this way). Amy, Rory, River and the Doctor escape to the top of the building, where River has been sending out a distress call to the universe, by which time Amy has fully remembered Rory. The Doctor and River marry (the Doctor whispers what he claims to be his name to River at this point). They kiss and restart the original course of events, with the Doctor being shot. Time returns to normal.

A future River (having just left the Byzantium) stops by at Amy's house and reveals that the Doctor is still alive. During his travels shortly before his death he encountered the Teselecta once more and took the captain's offer for help. He used the Teselecta to mimic his own appearance whilst hiding safely inside it, with the TARDIS. What he really whispered to River was ""look into my eye"", which she did and found him standing there, Stetson in hand.

A few points.

1. We do not have a good education system. I was hoping you would address the issue of segregated education, to be honest.
Coming out ""Best in Europe"" at primary maths is nice, but does it really matter? I think it's more important to look at what students have when they've finished their GCSE's. I don't see how you're ""forced to choose a career at 15"" because there are many options already available to you: university; tech; part-time study; apprenticeships; work experience..
The system is flexible enough, but it's not inclusive. The standards of all schools need to be raised so that by the time students finish their GCSE's, they are better qualified to make decisions on the next stage of education. We need quality control, especially when it comes to teaching staff. And we need integrated education to succeed. In my opinion, schools should ever be affiliated with any church.

2. The reason that buses do not run at regular time intervals is that there are times during the day, depending on the route, when there would be a peak of passenger numbers. Think school children and commuters; it's more efficient to have more frequent buses running at these times and less at periods in between.

It would be nice to have adult fares starting at 18 but that's small decision that's entirely down to Translink. The new £8 student discount card makes up for this anyway.

The Translink website is better than it used to be, I don't find too much trouble with it now.

There is an app for that, too, though not affiliated with Translink: http://www.tripni.co/

Double-sided printing for tickets? See now that's just wizardry and hocus pocus!

true,Ryantcairns,,Newcastle,"1. I 100% agree that integration needs to become the norm. I attended integrated Primary and Secondary schools, and i can honestly say it has given me such a different view of the world. I don't know or care what religion most of the people in my class are. It is their own business and I am lucky enough to live in a friendship group where it really doesn't factor into anything. I think the only way to get rid of segregation is to stop talking about it. Make integration the new normal and stop acting as a divided society. Move forward together and stop letting people's faith factor into ever piece of society. 

One idea is to potentially either reduce funding for new non-integrated schools in future, or make available additional funding for the construction of integrated schools.

If I had my way all schools would be integrated and all ability. 

To address your second part, I think that to say 'does it really matter' is quite a flippant statement. We need to celebrate our academic success. NI schools consistently beat their equivalents across the water on league tables. To throw that away only feeds NI's self-cynical view.

The system is not flexible enough. You choose set GCSEs which in turn dictate your A Level choices and ultimately what or if you can go to University. Sure Apprenticeships and Techs are available, but these do not suit everyone. Everyone should have, provided they have the ability, to study at Uni. There should be provisions made from the super-arty scientist or the History expert who didn't take it at A Level because he loved Politics more. (Hypotheticals). Again I point you to the International Baccalaureate system.

Of course the standard of schools needs to be raised across the board. But that itself is a bit of an unquantified statement without a plan. I'm 17 years old, I'm not gonna pretend to be an expert on education reform :P

2) I understand peak times and all that, but what I'm saying is that in certain areas, at weekends for instance, busses will depart every 10 or 20 minutes with as few as 3 passengers, while I will regularly see 10/15 people waiting for the same bus for ages. 

The decision on fares may be down to Translink, but it doesn't mean it's not something that should be lobbies on, and I don't agree its a 'small decision'. It doubles the cost of travel for non-working 16/17 year olds. 

A problem also arises when one friend in a group is able to 'game' the system and get a child ticket when over the age while another isn't. It almost turns to discrimination. And with many families struggling to make ends meet anyway, it's crazy that the cost is basically decided by what mood the driver is in. 

The student discount card is nice, but I'd argue the cost of transport is still far too high. Again, especially for 16 year olds who cannot work. We are encouraging them to stay in school, and yet charging what I would call ridiculous amounts.

The translink website has most definitely improved, but the timetables and fares should be front and centre. While i love the app you are talking about, it is hardly well known or well publicised. Maybe a team-up/partnership with Translink would be useful then? What I actually had in mind was a youth-targeted online hub which would make it easy to use for 11-17 year olds.

The ticket idea isn't that outrageous, maybe not on the back if not cost-effective, but it could definitely be done. I would love an Oyster type system, but would it work in NI, with its many rural areas etc?

I seriously hate people who lord it over others because they can speak another language. 

A usual complaint is that other countries have a higher percentage of 2 language speakers than we do here in the UK. Well it's hardly rocket science why that's the case. 

The vast majority of them will be learning English, which we already know. 

They're learning the world language out of necessity. They know their little niche language, and the world language. 

We are brought up to learn the world language from birth, then we can choose to learn a niche language but it's not necessary.

If a German learns English then he gets access to approximately 1.8bn extra people.

Sportsmanship and Gentlemanly conduct is getting up after being fouled and going ""No harm done mate, I know you didn't mean it"" not allowing other players to foul you over and over again and doing everything in your power to make sure their consistent fouling goes unpunished.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"&gt; Again to assume the commonwealth of which has stronger political binding than the EU historically would not do the same is absurd.

If you said to any one sixty or more years ago that Europe would be united and free of war between it's states at any point in the next couple of centuries, that person would have said you were mad and it happened. Those people who would have said you were mad, were and are right to think that. The chances of the union making it this far were incredibly unlikely and it took not one, but two world wars to create the political will to do it. There's no science to it, just luck and timing. We have the EU and a peaceful, democratic Europe now. The chances of it happening in the first place were monsteriously unlikely as it would be an Anglosphere-Union or Federated Commonwealth.

In summery: We have the EU. We will not be able to rely on creating another supranational entity like it. We should cherish and be proud of what we have and not think we can do better. We wont be able to.

&gt;unlike the EU which has mutated over the years into a federal state.

Couldn't one say the same about how this Federated Commonwealth would form? It's all very well saying ""Oh we'll do it all at once and be completely transparent and oh it'll all go swimmingly"". It wont. It'll doubtless be an **extremely long process**. Building the EU took 50 years and that was with everything on their side.

&gt;and who would likely consent to such a union being formed 

Now you're just pulling that out of no where. The will for greater unity between commonwealth states is small, if non existent. Australia is constantly thinking about ditching the Queen all together and Canada is the only Commonwealth country where other Commonwealth citizens aren't allowed to vote in elections. So you're left with tiny New Zealand and South Africa. I'm not exactly sure that even they're up for it and it doesn't exactly constitute a huge economy to throw around.

This Federated Commonwealth idea is laughable. Yes it's a nice idea but it'll never ever ever work. It wouldn't even be practical because it would span of countries most of which aren't even neighbours. The benefits would be negligible simply because of the distance.

An ideological vision of Europe would be more beneficial than an idealogical Commonwealth. A practical vision of Europe is never going to be as good as an idealogical vision of the Commonwealth. Visa versa, a practical vision of the Commonwealth is not going to be as good as an idealogical Europe.

We have to compare them both practically. Europe wins on that front. Europe actually exists despite the odd.

villa is in the twilight of his career and i don't think he wants to spend it on barcelona's bench. 15m would be good business on barcelona's part given that villa is 31 now, they'd be crazy to turn it down. it's actually a bit of overpayment on our part, just a bit, but i don't object. he isn't as quick and deft as he used to be so personally i don't think he's good enough to be the kind of investment that chelsea or arsenal are going to make, or that barcelona are going to want to continue to keep around. also, i've read that chelsea have moved onto getting alvaro negredo from sevilla as their primary target.

also, remember we're not just going after him because he's good: villa is a veteran spain and barcelona player who knows the system we play. that's partially why we went after rodgers' former players joe allen and fabio borini. villa was injured from this time last year up til this past fall, and he's also 31, so take a second to think before writing this thing off completely. he may not be as quick as he used to be, but he's still a smart player with loads of experience who makes good decisions on the pitch. this transfer isn't as unrealistic as we think it is.

The way people say they feel 'European' here now on this subreddit, above feeling akin to Canadians, Americans or Australians although they speak our native tongue, have closer cultural affiliations... because in this international world, being closer politically to mainland Europe due to our geographical location makes us 'politically progressive', even though the EU as an organisation directly rips apart democracy in certain memberstates, is absolutely absurd. 

The democratic right of the people, to not live under a dictatorship and to be 'free' is our right. How we can be involved in any way in the EU although public opinion is strongly against this, is why UKip is gaining as much momentum and support as it is. 

Clegg and the Lib Dems are seriously failing, because of the lack of leadership and vision they have as a party. To be truly 'liberal', in a fundamental sense, you have to look at the international community without fear of retribution of doing so. 

Although I vote UKip, I wouldn't say I'm 'anti-Europe', or 'pro-Europe', I vote UKip because under the government I pay taxes to, I believe they can do a hell of a lot better in the international community with the correct government and people in places they need to be.

Have you watched any of the European Parliament, it's on the BBC iPlayer btw... Merkle says that Greece can now industrialise, effectively meaning they can make us the cheap tat that China used to. The Chinese do not live in a democracy, they're brought up with a 'know your place in society' philosophy and although having a shittier quality of life isn't acceptable anywhere, inflicting that onto Greece which is a democracy was one of the main 'fuck the EU' factors of why most of the people in the UK now want to leave the EU.

This handling of the plots resulted in some rather rushed storytelling by the end of the season.  He approved some truly dreadful stories and how bad they are can not be explained merely by the budget.  The Moffat written episodes were amongst the best (if not the best) of the episodes of the Davies era.

During the Moffat era, we have plots spanning multiple seasons.  The season's arc has an affect the whole season.  The plot resolutions don't come out of nowhere.  The storytelling of these arcs is much more evenly paced.  And since the stories span multiple seasons, I wouldn't say threads have been left dangling, just some parts are getting moved along before others.  It happens in complex storytelling.  Sometimes one part of the story becomes predominant to get it out of the way before moving on with the main plot.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Only thing is to have that free trade agreement we need to implement laws which bring our products to the level required to trade with the EU. i.e. all laws that are currently in place and set by EU parliament. 

Number 2, we have to pay an amount to fund the free trade and movement of produce across the EU-UK trade union as Norway does, which might actually turn out to be quite a similar or larger amount than what we currently pay because we wouldn't have our rebate. 

Number 3, we have no say in legislation that is placed on 'how products should be designed or created, or what regulations are required', similar to Norway. So there is no democratic legitimacy at all.

Number 4, there are 3.5 million EU citizens living in the UK currently. That would reduce our population by if Wales and Manchester (city proper) left the UK, but yet we don't talk about the sheer economic impact of that. 

Number 5, the deal with the EU after leaving will be dependent on what the EU parliament will accept. I expect they will not be too fond of being favourable to a country who just reduced confidence in its institution by leaving. Plus, it's just a risk that is unnecessary.

Number 6, **There are 1 million british people living in southern spain, and 400,000 living in France.** There are more living in other EU countries too. We do generally just uproot and move to France actually, contrary to what you believe.

Number 7, the immigrants you're complaining about most likely are Polish, who have seen their GDP per capita go from 40% of the EU average in 2004 before they joined, to 70% since they joined. Polish immigrants in the UK are actually going back to Poland because their economy is booming whilst ours is crumbling. Poland is expected to become a net gainer of immigrants in the coming year, and the same will be true for Bulgaria and Romania.

Number 8, the European Court of Human Rights is not part of the EU, and was actually formed largely by the British to spread human rights across a war torn continent. If we leave the EU we will still be in the European Court of Human Rights. Neither the European Court or Court of Human Rights trounce over the UK. Even Russia doesn't complain about being part of the European Court of Human Rights.

The thought is always one of ""There is a cyclist, give them sufficient space."", whether they are wearing a helmet or not.

Now, as a cyclist I would always advocate the idea of riding in a dominant style - and again, irrespective of whether a helmet is on the skull or not.  Ride with a dominant style, and you'll always be safer on the road.

So, all these arguments fall somewhat flat with me.  And none of the arguments against wearing a helmet are strong enough for me to abandon my skull protector.

Of course he also contradicted himself calling them both microorganisms and robots:

---DOCTOR: The nanocloud. Microorganisms that automatically process any organic matter, living or dead, into a Dalek puppet. Anything attacks this place, it automatically becomes part of the on-site security.

---DOCTOR: The air all around is full of micro-machines. Robots the size of molecules. Nanogenes. Now that you're unprotected, you're being re-written. 

And that may be a clue, itself. But other than the Doctor not knowing what he is talking about, I'm not sure what it would be a clue to.

Also, never underestimate the power of a total screaming genius to break the limits of the nanocloud/nanogene programming.

true,InfinitelyThirsting,tardis,TARDIS,"See, I disagree about the showrunner, but agree about episodes. Moffat wrote amazing episodes. But he has been a terrible showrunner. There are *so* many plot hooks that Moffat has left hanging, without even *mentioning* them. The most egregious is **who blew up the TARDIS in Season 5??** Someone took control of and blew up the TARDIS, nearly destroying the entire universe, and we've... never tried to figure out who that was? Even though wondering who did it was the note S5 ended on?

RTD didn't have that many atrocious ones. Series 1 is half-bad, but it was brand new, no one knew if it'd be successful or not. Series 2 only has two (or 3, if you, unlike me, hate Love &amp; Monsters--the monster was silly, but it was designed by a child as part of a contest, so that gets a pass). Series 3 only has that one two-parter clunker with the Daleks. I don't think there's a single bad episode in series 4. And the specials are brilliant.

In comparison to Moffat, there's really not much of a difference, besides the first series. Until you get down to personal opinion--some people got tired of RTD's ""let's save the earth!"" series enders. I personally *loathe* the River storyline. I was so excited during S6, until the River reveal. I think Let's Kill Hitler is painfully bad, and I hate how he handled the whole stolen-daughter arc, it was very ham-handed and unrealistic and lazy. I very much disagree with your assertion that his plot resolutions don't come out of nowhere--he's the worst at deus ex machina and ""feelings and the power of love trump all!!"". 

I think RTD did a great job at subtly building up. Series 2 is all about Ten and Rose getting close and being ripped apart--not super complex, sure, but the themes are there. Series 3 has Saxon hidden in it from the start, with all kinds of coincidences from the very first episode. Series 4 leads up to the DoctorDonna in a bunch of ways, but also stolen planets, and things like the bees, and Rose sprinkled throughout. Sure, Davies had cheese, but I like his campy cheese way better than Moffat's sexist motherhood-and-the-power-of-feelings cheese. Oh, and Moffat's nasty habit of fake death.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; I quite revere Shakespeare; you rip up his anthology in front of me.

You completely miss the point. It's not the ripping up that was the issue. Anyone can buy a Koran and rip it up pretty much anywhere they want, no one is on trial for that and attempts to portray this as a ""blasphemy"" crime are just dishonest. The issue is the deliberate harassment that infringed on the believers freedom to practice and promote their religion in peace. 

If I came onto your stage *while you were performing Shakespeare* and ripped up the script I would not expect my protest to be ""protected speech"". Try shouting out ""she's only 13!"" during the love-making scene in Romeo and Juliet for example. You'll get thrown out and possibly arrested. There are a few limits to ""free speech"" and this is one of them, the key benchmark being ""does it infringe on other peoples rights?"". Hate speech promoting violence fails the same test. 

&gt;  the Koran incident should have no bearing on that case

Yes it should, he interfered with their free expression. It could have been the phone book he was tearing up, doesn't matter. He deliberately and pre-meditatively disrupted them. That's not cricket. 

BTW I'm an atheist *and* I'm selfish; I only stand up for these Muslim's rights because it's necessary to protect those same rights for myself. If I wanted to have a stand promoting evolution I would not like it to be perfectly legal for Christians to come along and shut down that stand.

true,osianjones25,lfc12,,"There's one of these threads every day on this subreddit. 

Our squad is weak - it's full of young players that will start performing in a few years and senior players that aren't good enough for top 4. Our biggest challenge now is to hold on to the great players whilst we wait for the youth to reach their potential. We're doing a good job of it with contracts being signed all over the place.

We have a solid back 4 and Reina is one of the top keepers in the league, we need depth here though. We have youth potential that can fill in, but they're not there yet so any injuries or suspensions and we have gaps in the defense. Our defense's form is also very inconsistent so that's a ball ache.

Sterling, Suso, Shelvey, Coates and Wisdom all have the potential to be top 4 players, some could even be title challenging players in my opinion if they all develop well but who knows what will happen there, what if Sterling is injured and loses his pace? What if Shelvey develops a Rooney complex because he becomes self conscious about his lack of hair?

If we can keep these young players then that gives us a good foundation to build on for the future. In 3 seasons or so these could be league leaders, who knows.

Gerrard, Lucas, Sahin, Allen - 4 players that on their day are unplayable so why is our attack so poor? We can control the midfield and hold on to the ball. I think our weakness is mostly down to finishing and creativity in the final third. We all saw that stat about us having the 2nd worst shooting accuracy in the top 5 European Leagues and hands down the worst in the UK. None of our players are renowned for their finishing skills!

Finishing - Suarez? Impressive but probably his weakest area as a forward. Gerrard? Lost his touch. Allen, Lucas? Defensive minded. Downing? Nevermind. Sterling? Pushed off the ball because he's so small. Sahin, Assaidi, Borini? Rarely played.

If we're looking for players this January to improve the squad and improve our performance, our weakest attribute is finishing, we need someone with a proven scoring record. We need cover for Suarez if he's injured or suspended. We need forwards, preferably 2 so we can get some rotation and competition for places within the squad. We aren't going to be able to do that with our massive wage bill so we need to get rid of players. 

Compare our forwards (Suarez, Sterling, Downing, Assaidi, Borini, *Shelvey*) to the top teams;

City - Balotelli, Dzecko, Aguero, Tevez  

United - RVP, Rooney, Hernandez, Valencia 

Chelsea - Torres, Hazard, Mata, Oscar

We're a long way off them, without Suarez our forwards are bottom half players, not at all scary!

tl;dr we have a solid defense and central midfield so we can keep the ball **if we decide to turn up for the match** but our forwards are not good enough, to get top 4 we need to find at least another 2 forwards/wingers close to Suarez's level or just wait for the youth to catch up by which time our current top 4 quality players will be too old and beyond their best",0,1356831385,null,0,false,0,c7o19zu,t3_15ncba,t1_c7o19zu,t3_15ncba,null,1430803693,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;how would you define 'true freedom', this again now is getting pretty abstract and irrelevant.

Indeed, and opens a whole philosophical can of wriggly stuff which can be hard to disentangle, but since you asked.  The problem I have with a lot of people on the right's idea of freedom is that it's mostly centred around being free to do absolutely whatever they like with their own shit - it's my stuff, leave it the fuck alone, kind of thing.  The problem with this is that it means you can exclude me from your property, and prevent me from doing anything you care to on your property, so, in reality, whatever freedom I have is completely circumscribed by the amount of property I have to do it with or on - no property = no freedom.  It wasn't for nothing that Proudhon not only noted that property is theft, but also said ""property is liberty"".  

Freedom is substantially dictated by the distribution of property - more property = more freedom, less property = less freedom.  Of course, it's not as simple as this - few property owners will completely eliminate the freedom of action of all people on or with their property, and these days, property certainly doesn't equate merely to land (it's perfectly possible to own very little land and still be very free, so long as you own other kinds of property that land owners desire).  But again, it's not for nothing that someone said something like ""If you have all the money in the world, and I own all the land, how much do you think I'll charge you for tomorrow's rent?""

&gt;But would you say a caveman was truly free? I mean like a hunter gatherer type of person, who has no idea how to smelt metal or make iron tools.. in the stone age. You're just wondering across the sea shore, looking for crabs an shit to eat. 

I'm not a primitvist, no.

&gt;The problem with that being 'true freedom', is that what if in your group of humans, a stronger, more dominant male usually rapes your girlfriend, because he can. He walks up to your grass basket and takes some crabs out of them for himself, because he's stronger than you. There is always an alpha in a group, after all.. so is it only the 'alpha' who is truly free?

No, I certainly don't support a might is might view of the world either, quite the contrary.  Although I have a broad streak of individualism, I'm also a strong believer in mutual aid and syndicalism.

&gt;We have that happening now, having to be governed as citizens by a government...So, what's a freer system than democracy? 

Well, given my politics I'm obviously against the State, although not against a bottom up organisation of governance based on horizontalism and radically democratic, participant and/or consensual decision-making.  I'd also want democracy extended into the economic sphere as I indicated in my last post. It seems wildly ironic that most of those who preach hardest and loudest about democracy want to limit it to the political sphere, which is of fairly low everyday importance to the average person, but are prepared to support, often enthusiastically cheerlead for what is basically a fascist oligarchy in the economic sphere!

Someone like Rickie Lambert, Steven Fletcher or Darren Bent who are capable of scoring double figures in the EPL every season. We haven't got a single established goal poacher in the entire team. 

We need a creative winger/attacking mid. Raheem Sterling is on his way to becoming a very good creative winger but we need someone now who can beat the fullback and set players up. Lets compare wingers/AMs to other teams:

United: Valencia, Young, Nani, Kagawa, Rooney    
Arsenal: Ox, Walcott, Cazorla, Podolski    
City: Nasri, Silva, Toure, Tevez    
Chelsea: Hazard, Oscar, Mata, Lampard    
Spurs: Dempsey, Sigurdsson, Bale, Lennon    
Everton: Fellaini, Pienaar, Osman,    
**Liverpool:** **Gerrard,** **Sterling,** **Suarez**

Now, United have Van Persie and Hernandez, City have Dzeko, Ageuro and Balotelli, Spurs have Defoe and Adebayor, Everton have Mirallas and Jelavic, Chelsea have Torres and Moses, Arsenal being the exception have two strikers who have scored less than their most creative players. We on the other hand haven't got that striker who just scores goals. We have a few players creating and converting our chances in the league when in reality we need most of the team chipping in. 

I can't fault the defence in terms of creating opportunities and scoring. Enrique and Johnson have been excellent going forward this season. Skrtel and Agger have probably already met their goals quota for an average season. Look at the midfield though. Aside from Gerrard &amp; Sterling with a few assist and goals, there's pretty much nothing coming from it. We could really do with a couple of prolific wingers. Suarez really has been a one man team this year in terms of getting results for us. His assists and goals haven't just been abundant, they've been vital at times. 

Just a couple more players contributing with goals and assists and we can challenge for a European spot again. Younger players can still get game time without as much expectation on them, allowing us to develop key players from within the youth system, while attracting good players to the club.  

Long term success requires attaining patience from players who, if they are good enough to play at the top level in the future, require the team to be ambitious and successful now. I don't mean we have to qualify for the CL or win a trophy this season. I mean we need to have a team who can keep up with the European contenders and can pick up points against the European contenders, while beating teams below them comfortably.

Well there are a whole host of possible explanations for the concentrations of different ethnic groups in different neighbourhoods, their relative economic success, school achievement etc., and very few have anything to do with genetics.  If we're talking about intelligence (and I don't know if he is, but it's a reasonable assumption) then there are so many issues it's difficult to know where to start - what the fuck is intelligence would be a good place!?  Then we could note how intelligence ad economic success aren't at all strongly correlated, and neither, to a lesser extent are intelligence and educational achievement.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"*sighs sadly at the naivety and slight immaturity of his opponent*

Military literally plays no part in the internal power play of Europe. The UK having nuclear weapons and a standing army of a few hundred thousand, does not give her any more power at a negotiating table or any other European theatre for asserting one's power. The only place it might have any affect is in Gibraltar and even that's extremely negligible.

Military might is only ever useful if there's an at least vague chance of you using it. Which there is literally known. But even this is missing the real point.

That point is that the EU does not command any military forces and it's strictly the job of EU member states to command armed forces. Germany, the most dictatorial state in the EU has a tiny army in comparison to other similarly sized countries like France and the UK. The EU does not impose its will upon others using military force. That is literally the most absurd thing I have heard today, possibly this week. It falls through on so many levels. If this was Sub-Saharan Africa, you would have a point. But it isn't Africa so you don't.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"I'm uncertain. Out of those I think democracy is going to be the clincher but fundamentally I believe it's already very democratic. The European Parliament is directly elected by voters. The Council of Ministers is made up of heads of state for individual countries. Those two are basically a mirror image of the House of Representatives and the Senate in the USA. Then there's the EU commission or council, I forget what it's called exactly, the executive branch. He is voted in by elected representatives.

It's sort of trickle up democracy. We get to decide who %90 of the people are, but the executive branch is decided by the people we elect who are just much more knowledgable on the subject and actually have to deal with the guys.

On the other fronts: It's already becoming more transparent with this [thing](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/15gwwl/eu_open_data_portal_now_in_public_beta/) and it's not like Europe is deliberately trying to be inefficient. If there is a good way of fixing it, they'll probably do it so long as it's in every one's best interesting, though some times there are problems as with France and the CAP. Though I bet that will get sorted out this decade.

Im conclusion: You'd be amazed how much the EU has changed in the last twenty years. That's the sort of time scale I'm looking at. So you might be surprised to find that Star Trek is only a few decades away. A European Super State would kind of fit in with a Star Trek setting, don't you think?

As you so very rightly say, it will take generations for the old sectarian dogs to die out of politics. That's why we need a new generation following them right up. Young people are disillusioned with politics, and have no interest in the workings of government. I don't have the statistics you want, but we in NI have one of the worst young voter turnout in the UK. 

If young people have actual electoral powers, they will naturally gain an interest because they know politicians will have to listen to them. Schools could hold the votes in the schools during schooltime and help to promote open and democratic debates etc.

We need to get young people involved and enthused about the political process as early as possible, and I'd argue that giving them electoral power is an important symbol of trust in the next generation. 

As for the 'fleg' situation, this is my own personal opinion BTW i respect the rights of protesters, but the violent guilty people should have been punished MUCH harder. I'm a 'unionist with a small u btw'

The decision was a democratic compromise decided and voted on fairly, and the violence levied against the Alliance party is nothing short of disgusting. As are the death threats towards any of the countries politicians. 

I think the policy as it now stands is the right one. The flag had no reason to be up 365 days a year, but nor does the Tricolour have any reason to fly.
