East Coast is currently operated nationally and is doing by far the best service.  All the ones which have been opened up for commercial competition and bidding are painfully priced and generally a pain in the arse, not to mention the issue of taking a journey which crosses two operators and you get charged through the FACE.  The current situation is utterly stupid.  Spend the time, to buy separate tickets between stations for a journey and you can save a lot of money.  

Why does it cost less to buy multiple tickets for the same train journey?

The major flaw is that in the end you have to say no to agreements if they go against your fundamental values. Decades of compromises means that Britain is always the one that gives ground.

Britain is also not a nation that has been repeatedly torn apart by its more powerful neighbours so we won't 'do anything' to make the project succeed. The democratic deficit matters to a nation with a history of reliable government and democracy more than fear of its neighbours or its own politicians.

The sceptics called it completely right when in came to the Euro. The Eurocrats are impoverishing millions of people and condemning young people to a life-time of misery to see through their ideal. Britain bankrupted its people post-WW1 trying to support a world currency, and did massive harm to its people with the gold standard and with the ERM and yet no lessons are accepted by Brussels/Strasburg.

1) My sister in law is a physiotherapist. She worked in the private sector and then joined the NHS. She left the private sector because the company she worked for was dangerously incompetent.

The NHS has a lot of regulations. Professionals are *required* to spend time each year keeping up to date with current research. While this kind of rigorous professionalism can exist in the private sector, in the case of physiotherapy it apparently doesn't.

2) Bear in mind that NHS professionals perform other roles besides their speciality. For example, emergancy planning. Did you know that the NHS has plans for how to man hospitals when a third of their staff have died? Did you know that speech and language therapists will, in an emergancy, become nurses? Probably physios too. But if they're in the private sector, suddenly the NHS has no reserve nurses.

3) Bear in mind that, even within their field, specialists may have roles that you would consider regular NHS work. The NHS needs speech therapists in hospitals on stroke wards because speech therapists can assess whether a patient is going to choke to death if you give them food. If all the speech therapists go private, this creates a problem because it removes them from NHS sites. Sure, they could be brought in, but it strikes me as being a real step backwards.",0,1349347416,null,0,false,0,c6hh0am,t3_10xclq,t1_c6hh0am,t1_c6hgxr9,null,1430061317,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

true,[deleted],null,null,"I work with children who have been abused and in my experience the relationship between a child and their abuser can be extremely complex and it is actually very common for victims to feel compelled to return to their abuser. Many paedophiles are skilled in the manipulation of vulnerable children. They may 'groom' the child for a prolonged period of time in order to gain their trust and make the child feel a sense of loyalty or affection towards them before any sexual contact occurs, making it difficult for the child to sever the relationship or ""get them into trouble"". They may have been manipulated to believe that what is happening is normal/acceptable or even that they have been chosen because they are ""special"". Many abused children also blame themselves for the abuse and paedophiles can be very good at perpetuating this feeling of guilt (""you lead me on"", ""I thought you wanted this"", ""you're so pretty I can't help it"" are all fairly common) so the child may keep going back for more as a way of punishing themselves. Then, of course, you have the less subtle (but still common) technique of threatening the child that they/or their families will be harmed or killed if the child does not allow the sexual contact to continue. 

Obviously I don't know if any of the above is the case with Saville and his (alledged) victims. I just think it's important to keep in mind that the issue is extremely complex and that the trauma of being abused can manifest itself in different ways.

I can only go on my own experience. I've seen about 5 NHS physios, and about 5 private physios, and the people who actually helped were the private physios. Partly because you had the choice to bounce around until you found someone who turned out to have an understanding of the problem, or was simply credible. I'm dubious as to whether a check-box exercise to read new publications is equivalent to the pressure to constantly engage with and help patients, or have them go elsewhere. It's really clear to me that physiotherapy is as much a skill as it is a science.

&gt; 3) Bear in mind that, even within their field, specialists may have roles that you would consider regular NHS work. The NHS needs speech therapists in hospitals on stroke wards because speech therapists can assess whether a patient is going to choke to death if you give them food. If all the speech therapists go private, this creates a problem because it removes them from NHS sites. Sure, they could be brought in, but it strikes me as being a real step backwards.

This is a good point. I'm not saying that all physio services should be privatized, and I didn't say anything about speech therapists (I don't know enough to comment). The physios working as part of interdisciplinary teams need to stay in house. I'm talking about boilerplate services. If I've broken my leg in an uncomplicated way, the post-op physio would be better done in the private clinic down the road, than in a hospital 30 miles away, at 50% higher cost.",0,1349348635,null,0,false,0,c6hh475,t3_10xclq,t1_c6hh475,t1_c6hh0am,null,1430061367,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

What is especially disturbing is the nature of the alleged abuse – the fact that it apparently took place repeatedly, in the workplace and at a school he was visiting, and that it may have been known to his bosses and co-workers. My thoughts are with the victims. I hope they find peace.

true,nakedladies,eng-GreaterLondon,Crystal Palace mandem,"I think this whole episode is much more involved than most people are recognising. I've had a few thoughts on my mind since last night, so pardon me, this may go on a bit.

First: Let's just take it as read that what the people in the documentary last night said is completely true. They do, after all, have no reason to make that stuff up. 

Second: Jimmy Savile was a very disturbed man. While he appeared to be a relatively harmless eccentric in his prime, anyone who watched Louis Theroux's programme in which he spends time with Savile must recognise that this was a man with serious problems. I'm NOT making excuses for him, but sexual deviancy really was just the tip of the iceberg with that guy. 

Third: Fear. Savile's ""habits"" were an open secret in the entertainment industry. My uncle, for example, used to work for the BBC, and he had heard rumours. But while rumours will always spread, especially salacious ones like this, proof was impossible to come by. And the UK has some of the strictest libel laws in the world. Savile knew this and had enough coin to keep a strong legal team on his side. Everybody involved in the press knew that if they broke such a story, and if there was even the slightest weakness in their proof, then they'd be shut down and out of a job for life.

There was simply never enough proof to warrant a media exposure. Now you may be thinking, what about the barrister at the end of the documentary who said that based on the filmmaker's evidence, there was enough material to attempt a prosecution? Well, that's after he's dead, now that his victims have the confidence to step forward and tell their stories.

Fourth: Coverups and the BBC. It is very easy to say ""how could word have not got out? There must have been an institution-wide coverup!"". I don't buy it. At the time, the 1970s, Savile was extremely wealthy and well connected. He had a legal team strong enough to protect his name. That took care of the press. As for Savile's public appearance, he always presented himself as a salt-of-the-earth butter-wouldn't-melt working man with a heart of gold and a list of charitable causes as long as his arm. And his story checked out. He was respected by both the establishment and his audience. This is rare. 

Now, imagine you were that BBC staffer who walked in on him in his dressing room with a 14 year old girl on his lap. Who would you turn to? Maybe your supervisor had heard a rumour or two about Savile. Maybe your coworkers had too. But how can your word, your explanation of what you're pretty sure you saw, stand up against everything that people already knew about the man?

""Jimmy Savile? Abusing a young girl in his dressing room? This is the same guy who does constant charity work despite being a millionnaire and public figure. Come on now, missy. You must have misread the situation.""

It would be humiliating for you. Just not worth it. With the whole of the media on lockdown, and individual witnesses too personally scared to speak out, what do you expect to have happened? This isn't an institutional coverup. It's too many blind eyes being turned. It's a textbook example of the old saying ""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing"". 

It's not like a memo went around the upper levels of the BBC saying ""Jimmy Savile is a pedophile, everybody knows, but keep it under your hat"".

Fifth: ITV and sticking the boot in. The documentary itself was trash. I'm sorry, but it was. Poorly written, overly dramatically scored, and sloppily presented. At times it was like watching a Chris Morris satire. Lots of slowed-down footage of Savile grinning with a cigar in his mouth. Lots of scary dramatic music. A textbook hatchet job, basically. I mean, it's bad enough that they've got all this material to bring the truth to light. Was all that extra dramatic post-production really necessary?

The presenter would constantly mention that Savile was a strictly BBC name. He wouldn't just abuse girls in his audiences. He abused girls in his *BBC* audiences. He didn't work on television shows, he worked on *BBC* television shows. Despite the fact that Savile's crimes took place in many different settings (there was a cruise ship mentioned, a nightclub, some others that escape me at the moment), only the BBC was name-checked. It didn't need to be pointed out like that. But they gleefully went for it.

OK, I'll wrap this up. People are focussing on what Savile did. Twitter is basically tutting so much you can almost physically hear it. The papers, I'm sure, will be filled with outrage and disgust at his offenses. But I think we're focussing on the wrong details here. We should be looking at how celebrities are elevated above the law to the point where they are untouchable. We should be thinking about making it easier and more secure for whistleblowers to step forward, so stories like this don't go unheard in the future. And we should be protesting the UK's still-outrageous libel laws, now that we've seen first-hand what damage can be done when the media is too scared to tell the truth.

Midnight is a fantastic episode for that exact reason, the monster wasn't the thing in Mrs Silvestri. The monsters, were the humans. 
It was a deep and insightful look into how a group of perfectly normal people an and will change under pressure and when influenced by others.

For example, Jethro's father (his name evades me, I apologise), began the trip joking with the other passengers (""The pool, was abstract!""), with the Doctor in the seat in front of him, knelt upright laughing along. 
As soon as the concept of fear arrived, this notion of brotherhood completely leaves them, and their misconceptions and refusal to believe or accept anything different or above them becomes the ultimate downfall.

With a bit of thought, Midnight is the most realistic, believable, and relative episodes of Doctor Who. We worry about the monster under the bed, when in reality, the monster is the one under the sheets.

true,UnoriginalGuy,welsh,Wales,"Driving in the UK is bullshit.    

Learning to drive is incredibly expensive (£25/hour+) and requires a lot of time (20 hrs+); they keep making the test harder and harder every year (which will add to the hours it takes) and even once you pass you're now greeted with a potential insurance bill which is more than the car's value PER YEAR.     

This suggestions wouldn't impact me or anyone I know because **they couldn't afford to drive at 17**. I literally knew nobody with a car who was below the age of 21. I knew tons of people who had a motorcycle however.    

These suggests are kind of random anyway. They don't appear to have come from a place of research or factual reduction in death or claims, they appear to be pie-in-the-sky ideas that some random executive have thought MIGHT have a positive impact because they sound like they will.    

&gt; A ban on learners being able to take an intensive driving course as their only method of passing     

I have no idea what this means and it isn't explained in the article. Everyone has to take the same test, they either pass or don't. How does it matter how you learnt to drive? Either through an intensive course or over weeks or months?    

&gt; During this time the number of young passengers that a newly-qualified driver could carry would be restricted     

Care to show how this reduces the likelihoods of accidents? Or any justification for it supported by facts?    
 
&gt; They would also be banned from driving between 11:00pm and 4:00am for the first six months, unless they were driving to and from work or college    

No, fucking, way. Nobody should have to try and prove where they have been to the police. Plus what about if you're going to the airport, to the hospital, travelling, etc? Why does it matter where you've using your car to travel between? Plus 11pm to 4am, why those numbers? And why only the young?     

&gt; There would be no blood alcohol allowed during those first six months    

 0.0 blood alcohol is beyond the accuracy of the machines we use to measure blood alcohol. Completely unenforceable.    

&gt; It said an 18-year-old was more than three times as likely as a 48-year-old to be involved in a crash    

**Only** three times? Then why does an 18 year old pay almost 20x as much as a 48 year old on insurance?    

Basically this whole scheme is designed to increase profits for insurance companies which I'm sure they will forget to reflect in lower premiums for motorists. There isn't much fact to go on here, and it seems like they're just trying to make young drivers second class citizens with random restrictions and bullshit invasions of their privacy.     

Here is my list of changes I would like to see (since we are playing pull-out-of-your-arse):     

 - Cap on no-claims-bonuses. Limit to 5 years only. No discounts beyond that. Insurers cannot ask for a driver's claims history beyond that 5 year point or store it, or share it.       
 - Insurer does get access to a driver's criminal history per current law (nothing changes).    
 - Insurers must spend 80% of the premiums on claims (and expenses related to claims, like rental cars). By law.    
 - Insurers cannot discriminate based on a driver's age (or gender, but already law)     
 - Insurers are capped on how much they can discriminate by address (e.g. up to +15% of the average for that area).    

This will cause premiums to increase for some, decrease for others, but normalise for the entire country. Instead of seeing some people with £2000 yearly bills, while others pay £65, we might see everyone paying £150 and ""sharing the risk.""

&gt;it changes from being health care provided by hundreds of health care professionals working together to being decided by dealings between a few MPs and businesses in competition with each other. Any advances in medicine discovered by these private companies will be copyrighted, possibly at the detriment of other patients. More and more NHS hospital beds will be occupied by private patients. Doctors will be divided into a few who will become rich, and many who will end up working on reduced terms and with little professional freedom for large corporations.

My comment:

You've (very romantically) overestated the role of doctors in the administration of the NHS. The people in charge of the NHS are not ""health care professionals"". They are accountants and managers. They get raises and bonuses for cutting costs, just like in the private sector.

The NHS have an [extensive patent portfolio](http://www.homerton.nhs.uk/uploaded_files/R_D/doh_framework___guidance_on_managment_of_intellectual_property_in_the_nhs.pdf), and produce revenue from licencing these patents to the private sector.

The NHS receives payment for rented beds, which is a vital source of revenue for them. Actually, theoretically, if more people went private, the market for private healthcare in the UK would expand and it's likely that investment in private hospitals would become more feasible. This would have a *net increase* on the amount of available beds.

Care to repeat that? You're suggesting that opening up the healthcare market to competition will result in ""little professional freedom"" for doctors? Do you think that working for a large, monolithic, pseudo-monopolistic government body provides doctors with more ""professional freedom"" than private practices?

If doctors earn more under privatized healthcare, then they were probably being underpaid under nationalised healthcare.",0,1349352775,null,0,false,0,c6hhk2n,t3_10xclq,t1_c6hhk2n,t1_c6hhg03,null,1430061574,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2
true,ParrotofDoom,english,Greater Manchester,"Asking people to drive for a year is silly.  These young, inexperienced motorists are perfectly capable of driving safely, else they wouldn't pass the tests they're required to sit.

What's needed is the correct attitude, because for a minority of these new drivers, everything they learn instantly gets thrown out of the window.  They stop signalling when pulling into a road.  They do not cover the brake pedal when approaching hazards.  They change down through the gears while braking.  They drive with one hand at the top or bottom of the wheel.  They seem to lose the concept of continuous risk assessment and have no concept of analysing the road immediately ahead of them, while driving at speeds inappropriate for the prevailing conditions.  So I would say it's fine to place some limitations on new drivers, such as driving hours or passenger numbers, but not all those suggested by the insurance companies.

I would also make cycling and pedestrian training a compulsory part of the driving test.  It simply is unacceptable that people are allowed to drive a car with little to no understanding of the needs of vulnerable road users.

You are allowed 14 minor faults before you fail your test - 14 is stupidly high.  If you want new drivers to be safer, it should be 4 or 5 at the most.  New drivers should have all the rules of the road fresh in their head.

The theory part of the test is also really easy - I scored 98%, I didn't read the highway code book, I just practiced the tests from a DVD program for my pc until I passed every time.

true,impablomations,northumberland,Northumberland,"That was down to underinvestment by the govt at the time.  Maggy Thatcher and her buddies were in love with privatisation so deliberately let the system run down (wouldn't buy new trains, invest in infrastructure etc) so that the case for privatisation would be more attractive to the public.

The private companies that run the system now, won't invest in new trains in case they lose their franchise.

With public ownership - any profit can be plowed back into the system.

With private ownership - as well as (supposedly) investing in the system, profit also has to be shared with directors and shareholders - and you can guess which gets that larger portion (hint.  it's not investment in the system)

Under BR - trains that were 5 minutes late were actually marked down as late.  Nowadays - if a train is 10 mins late it is 'deemed' to be on time.

The Newcastle - London train closes  it's doors 2 mins before departure to ensure it leaves on time.

So you have a situation where if you 2 mins early you are too late to travel, but if the train is 10 mins late - it is on time.  

You also have situations where if a train is running really late, it will be cancelled for the return journey - if it doesn't run then it can't be late.

This is all to cook the numbers to meet their targets, to make sure they get their hands on more govt subsidy.

Personally I think there should be a ""minimum number of hours"" rule introduced, with seperate required times for urban and A-road/Dual carriageway driving.

&gt;The introduction of a new ""graduated"" licence for the first six months after passing a test During this time the number of young passengers that a newly-qualified driver could carry would be restricted

I'm not entirely sure how this would help.  If it's all about distractions then it's just as easy to be distracted by changing a CD (or the volume of it) as it is by having someone else in the car with you.  I guess it might result in less people per car being killed in accidents though.

&gt;They would also be banned from driving between 11:00pm and 4:00am for the first six months, unless they were driving to and from work or college There would be no blood alcohol allowed during those first six months But young drivers would be able to start learning earlier, at the age of 16 and a half

Again, I'm not sure how stopping someone driving in the middle of the night is going to help, unless it's to try and reduce drink-driving, in which case it should start earlier.  Zero blood-alcohol levels makes complete sense though.

I passed my test first time in '89 at the age of 17 as did most of my friends.  Most of us were lucky enough to be insured as learners with our parent's cars and pestered them into letting us drive everywhere we could as well.  I must have had something like 20 hours of lessons and maybe two or three times that driving my dad's car before passing my test.  And I still did stupid/dangerous shit given half the chance.

true,NeoNerd,scot-Aberdeen,Aberdeenshire,"&gt;A ban on learners being able to take an intensive driving course as their only method of passing.

This is purely anecdotal, but everyone I know who did an intensive course crashed within the first three years of driving. Not minor bumps, but properly crashing. A couple of them totaled the cars. I see intensive courses as being similar to cramming for an exam. The knowledge sits in your mind for a short time, but doesn't sink in properly. They all passed first time, but they're not great drivers. 

&gt;During this time the number of young passengers that a newly-qualified driver could carry would be restricted

I suspect this is for two reasons. First, there are a number of reports each week of multiple young people killed when one car crashes. It may be an attempt to reduce that. Second, I suspect a 17-year old me would have driven like an idiot to impress friends or more importantly girls. If you can't have young passengers, that reduces. 

&gt;They would also be banned from driving between 11:00pm and 4:00am for the first six months, unless they were driving to and from work or college.

The reasoning behind this is fairly simplistic, I think. People have more accidents at night. Also, you're not necessarily taught night driving at all during lessons. But I don't see how young people can get night-driving experience without driving at night. I agree that having to justify where you've been is ridiculous. It's obviously intended to avoid putting young workers out of work because they can't get home, but it's still stupid.

&gt;There would be no blood alcohol allowed during those first six months

Agreed that this is ridiculous. It's generally accepted that 0.2 is the minimum possible to accurately detect. This also allows for medicines with an alcohol base/having had a glass of wine the night before.

&gt;If the police came back and said there was no case, not enough evidence, I should imagine the BBC lawyers would be very nervous about making allegations.

I seem to think, from what I've read anyway, that's pretty much what happened. The Newsnight editor gave his team two stipulations for running the allegations, one of which was checking with the CPS and Police about the case. The Police had cautioned him and the CPS felt they couldn't make a prosecution case from the matter, so the editorial decision was not to run the story.

Obviously the team felt it was still newsworthy, hence why they were angry.

When the gang first gets together they are constantly on the move. Planets to see, people to save and all that...

But by the time TATM takes place the Ponds' have had serious discussion about stopping all of their traveling. The Amy and Rory that the Doctor and River know are restless adventurers. But they've changed. We've seen it. But the Doctor and River haven't. From their perspective the Ponds' desire for adventure is as strong as ever.

The Doctor knows they've thought about it (""You're thinking about stopping, aren't you?""), but he isn't aware of the concrete conclusions they've come to in the beginning of TPOT. Even when they leave with him at the end, it's more at Brian's behest than it is their own.

So from my point of view, it was a line that highlighted how much the Ponds' desires have changed this year. River believes they would be bored being stationary. While that may have been true at one time, what they really wanted was a place to stay and build a life together. So despite being zapped to another era by an Angel, they really did get what they realized they ultimately wanted.

**Essien** - :(. He could still have done a job this season. We don't have a defensive RW if Ramires plays CM as a true box-to-box midfielder. But, yes, his time is done apparently. He should sign for Juve and back up Vidal.


**Turnbull/Hilario** - Turnbull is really not good. Him and Brad Jones orchestrated the downfall of Southgate's career (harsh, but, yeah), and both got jobs as 2nd GKs of top EPL sides. Both turned out shit. Hilario has been a great servant. Good signing, an experienced 3rd GK to chill and play some games and not complain. We have Courtois and Blackman for 2nd and 3rd.


**Luiz** - Three years and he's gone to Real Madrid/Barcelona, sadly. I hope it doesn't happen, since he's crazy, technical, fast, and just a good guy. Positioning deficiencies won't be as much of a problem in La Liga. At least won't be focused on.

**One of Sturridge/Moses/Marin**  - One will be very happy, one will be a bit meh, and one will be unhappy. We'll keep two and get rid of one for decent money. Sturridge was very ademant that he would go to Arsenal if RVP left. I assume he was forced to stay because Moses' deal took such a long time. Marin looked incredible pre-season. Much better than Hazard looked. Top 3 crosser on the team with Mata and Torres, and fearless at attacking the full back, with the selfness of Hazard. I think he'll make it for sure.

**Two of van Aanholt/Kakuta/Bruma** - vanA surely recognizes Bertrand is favoured. His saviour might be that Bertrand is being reverted to a defensive LW for big games away from home, which means injuries/suspensions to Ashley Cole could see openings. Also, this Cole-contract-saga is annoying. Bruma is okay, but we have a few very solid prospects (Chalobah!). If Terry decides to murder the whole FA and gets sentenced to community service without football, he might stand a chance, though. Kakuta. Woof. Good Dijon loan last season, but he might struggle considering we have 1041 other AMs/Wingers now. 2 of these 3 will leave soon, the third will Gibson-it.

**Benayoun** - Yeah, no. Gone. He should go to Everton. We should really just send people to Everton on loan, in general, so they learn to play football.

**Ferreira** - I love him. He brings all the Portuguese-speaking players together. I'm sure he organizes great BBQs at his place. He will surely get a role behind the scenes afterwards, as mentor or interior designer for the future Iberian/South American purchases.

Sorry for the late approval. Birmingham is a brilliant city. I miss it terribly! 

* Has she sorted her mobile phone? I loathed O2 for a lot of reasons, one reason was the shitty coverage I felt I got compared to my friends on Orange. Also O2 was a major jerk when I left the country, so that withstanding..
* Brum is a relatively safe place. She shouldn't run afoul. Trust her instinct. There some grotty bits, like Ladywood and Aston, but even in there I never felt ""in danger"" (as a point of reference I lived in the ""gentrified"" bit of Ladywood, right across the way from Brindley Place). As for other neighbourhoods to avoid: Sparkbook, Nechells, some parts of Handsworth, Ward End, and there are bits of Erdington which are still pretty bad. Winson Green or Newton, too; but, really, if she keeps her wits about her, I don't really feel there are any estates to truly avoid. I lived in a nice bubble, however, so trust what some other people say on that topic. I double-checked with a Birmingham native boyfriend (Sutton Coldfield) and he chimed in with the list of other neighbourhoods to steer clear of!
* Brummies are incredibly nice and easy to meet and chat with. The only thing I would say is difficult is people have very set friendship groups. Speaking as a foreigner to the city, I found people don't like to leave Birmingham -- probably because it is pretty great! -- so you're looking at a lot of groups who have been friends since primary school. Places to deffo go for a good chance to socialise are the Victoria and the Jekyll and Hyde. I'd pop in for a pub quiz somewhere and see if she can ask a team to join. Easy way to get to know some people. Pick up classes at the mac?
* Not to dash your dream, but the visa situation in the UK for Americans is incredibly difficult. While architectural engineering might be good, there has been a lot of construction in the city recently, I'm not sure if you'd qualify for a visa. Construction is a pretty popular job in the city, so to beat out a local, or any European, for a position would be difficult. I'd suggest finding companies who do your line of work and getting in touch now about whether they can sponsor your visa. I don't think you'll get in on a Tier 1 skilled worker visa, unfortunately; they're more interested in computer programmers, nurses, doctors, and engineering along the mechanical side. You could try, but I'm really wary of it, so you'll need to find a sponsor: which is pulling teeth. You are going to have more luck getting her back into the USA with a phD or marrying her. The sad reality of immigration in the UK :)
* Enjoy it. Brum gets a real bad rap as some kind of rubbish city and the fact is: it isn't. It's a remarkably pretty city, if you look up ;), with wonderful people, and the pound goes a lot further than it does in London or Manchester (despite Birmingham being the second city)! It's well linked for travel from New Street, it's relatively safe, people are friendly and welcoming, and it has its own distinct vibe. I found it to be wonderfully multicultural with lots to do.

Now though, I am more confident of being heard over appealing etc now that the problem with these processes are more well known and I realise the tribunals are independent. The one thing that worries me now is that I'll have to re-apply for DLA (too late to appeal my previous claim), go through the whole process again, only to have to re-apply when DLA gets replaced with PIP next year. And I hate.. *hate* those assessments. I'm meeting with someone from a charity next week though about being moved to specialised-but-independent housing and increased support, so I might bring it up with them and see what they think. Even the *charity* had to make special circumstances for me because they usually only deal with mental health patients (but provide physical aids for those with both mental and physical issues). I have cognitive and physical problems - not quite in their criteria for 'mental health'. They said they can help me based on the cognitive aspect, but I know I'm lucky for their kindness.

Thing that bothers me most? Although I will never recover from my condition/disability, with the right environment (housing, carer, etc) I CAN get better enough to get myself a job, improve my capabilities and live a close to normal life. It will just take time to adapt, with an appropriate environment for my needs. I *want* that. I want a job, boyfriend.. I *want* to pay my own bills and say 'I did that, this is all mine'. But due to financial difficulties at being refused help.. My health is rock bottom and I can't even leave the house. And.. honestly? I'm going to cost them more money in the long run this way, because I'm constantly relying on things such as housing benefit, charities and the lowest-rung safety nets. I've faced sleeping on the streets before, and if it werent for the charities saving my ass.. I would have cost my local council a *buttload* in that situation. No one wants that. They massively overestimate the number of people who *want* to scrounge. Very few people want to be under the governments thumb in regards to welfare. Almost everyone wants their own corner of the world, be proud to work for what they have and say 'Mine! All mine! I did this!'. Unfortunately, some people have to ask for help. Not like we WANT to.

&gt; A crash is not just the cost of your vehicle. It's the cost of the 48 y/o's vehicle, plus settlement for the ""whip lash"". Plus the damage to public/private property. Easily 10's of thousands of pounds.


So your theory is whiplash and damage to other vehicles is on average 7x as great when an 18 year old is the driver in an accident, as compared to a 48 year old?  That doesn't sound correct.

As to the £20k vs £500 car.  You do realise that the cost of the vehicle is a tiny part of it?  And a £20k new car is likely to be far safer in an accident than some £500 ten year old POS so cover would not be cheaper.  Not to mention that insurance must cover the cost of injuries and damage to other people and property, more so with the increase in personal liability claims.  The premium rates are based on risk, and a young driver is a riskier customer than one with more experience.

So a 18 year old with one year's experience who's 3x more likely to cause an accident is rightly paying more than a 40 year old with 20+ years of experience and full no-claims.

I don't disagree with the fact that this status quo your relative has experienced is not ridiculous.

However, I think that there is an alternative solution of the Hospital discharging back into Primary Care and the physiotherapy being offered [or ""comissioned""] from primary care - which at the moment looks like it will be smaller than the PCTs of old, and thus more likely to be local.

&gt; I can only go on my own experience. I've seen about 5 NHS physios, and about 5 private physios, and the people who actually helped were the private physios. Partly because you had the choice to bounce around until you found someone who turned out to have an understanding of the problem, or was simply credible.

If this the actually the case - then there is either a serious problem within physiotherapy training.  Or there is some reason why these great physios don't want to work within the NHS.  Bringing great services/practicioners into the service should not be overlooked!

I agree entirely.

One of the things that makes cycling so much less stressful in other countries (eg: Netherlands / Copenhagen) is that most drivers use bikes on the road, so do the rest of the family.  So they understand what it feels like to have a car right up your arse, or being buzzed with only a foot to spare.  That and infrastructure designed by people that actually use a bike.

Like the OP I live in a rural area. But this means I have large distances between where I live, where I work, where I shop and socialise, and my friend's houses etc. And public transport is just inadequate.

So we need to drive here. Everyone learns at different paces so dictating a years learning is just silly. Some people will be ready well before then, and others will still not be. Maybe more use of the green L plates should be in place. 

The not driving at night one is silly, and as has been discussed at other times when blood alchohol levels are being discussed, a zero level would be difficult to enforce.

I too have seen too many peers kill themselves by showing off etc in cars. But why should everyone else who needs to drive to live a normal live be punished for that? I know police budgets etc are being cut but the ideal option would simply be better traffic policing. Not singling out one group. There are other equally dangerous people on the road.

true,[deleted],null,null,":) I recently went through the ESA assessment too, from incapacity benefit. I went all out this time and provided a good 25 pages more than just my form including doctors statements, information from my carers, information on my condition, timelines of how my capabilities have varied going way back to 2005. I remember stuffing it into the extra-large envelope I had to get thinking 'FINE. TAKE THIS, YOU ROTTEN BUGGERS!'. 

I called them two weeks ago about the conclusion and got told I would be put straight into the support group without medical, and that I would get confirmation in writing very soon. I rang them again today to check up, and got someone who was very grumpy and vague saying 'You will get confirmation when you are transferred over' - so I asked them if that meant I was still being transferred over without a medical assessment, and they said 'Yes. Goodbye.'.

I worry that they've changed their mind and will put me into the work-related activity group - and whilst I actually really love the sound of that scheme, I'm just not up to it right now as my health hasn't improved since I sent the form off - it's actually gotten worse - and I know I'll be kicked off for not being able to attend the meets. I just hope they took note of my doctors statement about being housebound. Not looking forward to having to appeal, which I will have to as incapacity is everything I have right now.

Why?  Because the Council used a senior commercial services officer who had worked in the nice cosy sheltered council for 28 years as their contract manager while BT's negotiators were hard faced corporate bastards used to striking deals with other equally hard face and ruthless corporate bastards and they basically tore the Council's cosy little manager to pieces.

The behaviour of the Foreign Office was outrageous, unprecedented and nullifying the embassy hasn't been taken off the table yet. It was quite the empty threat then seen as it entailed literally four vans and forty policemen, some entering the general building, others going up fire escapes looking through windows whilst yet more blocked off every road, all at 1 to 5 am in the morning. Do you think Iran would have gotten away with such ""empty threats"" under the cover of darkness? How about China and the activist that took refuge in the US embassy?

&gt; However the concept of asylum isn't meant to allow people to skip bail.

Quite correct, Ecuador gave him asylum because he was vulnerable to a US political persecution, indefinite detention and torture, so there are two discreet legal procedures occurring. To draw a parallel: a person in witness protection hiding from the mafia gets a dangerous driving charge with the potential of jail time. What's the correct thing to do? Allow the mafia trial to conclude, try the witness in open court, or allow which ever is judged most pertinent to happen first and then conclude the latter?

Extradition to Sweden literally would deny Assange the possibility of asylum, seeking asylum in no way precludes Assange going to Sweden at a later date. (Do bear in mind that Assange has already been confined longer than the maximum sentence he would get even on the slim chance of a guilty verdict in a fair court - the primary evidence and leaked testimony is so strongly in his favour.) Once Ecuador sees no threat from the US then there is no grounds to deny a Swedish extradition request.

However, I do feel angry that no-one senior at *any* of the the establishments he worked at took the rumours – which they must *surely* have been aware of – seriously enough to have him investigated. If lack of evidence was their main concern I'm sure a private investigator could have acquired it quite easily if the talk about his nonchalant attitude about his behaviour was even remotely true. I consider such lack of action at senior levels to be a form of collective cowardice.  

As for the documentary itself: well I don't quite agree that it was ""trash"" even though it *was* overly dramatic and *did* put too much effort into ""sticking the boot in"" – as you put it – to the BBC. But if you can ignore that and all of the annoying post-production drama crap – which is sadly just a fact of modern-day documentary making, it seems – and focus solely on the interviews and accounts given, it made a good case. In the end I agreed with Esther Rantzen; like her, I was determined not to decide whether he was guilty or not because he is no longer around to defend himself.

 They're gunning tax evasion recently and not holding anything back, with special teams specifically tasked to monitor the UK's richest 500,000.  They've even already extended the unit its results were so impressive.  They're having to double the staff at the Liechtenstein disclosure facility - that's a facility that allows people with money overseas to 'come in from the cold'  and put their affairs in order before they're found to have abused the system.

It's not either or.  They're going after both.

Google 'HMRC' and 'task force', because they've launched 12 in the last year and they've proved so successful they're bringing the number up to 30.  They're not just going after the corporates and the UK's richest economical with their disclosures, either.  Did you know we now have a 'hair &amp; beauty' task force dedicated to the North East?  Sounds ridiculous.  Revenue and Customs became aware that it's a popular way to launder money.  It's the motor trade in Scotland, and it's the legal industry in London.  They've all been launched in the last few months.  They're going after tax avoidance schemes too looking for impropriety. 

They doubled the money claimed back from tax evasion last year.  It's predicted to soon be £7bn a year.

HMRC has been in the news a lot recently.  
It's like they're taking back Gotham.

You mention comparison with European systems, which is really dodging the question. I would like to see evidence that a return to British Rail would be a step in the right direction, given our unique set of problems when it comes to rail travel. The only posts I've seen in here that tackle that question seem to suggest that British Rail *was worse*, and I see no indication that a return to it would somehow magically improve services, or even, as you claim, lower rail fares. 

&gt; The fact remains, you cannot entrust a required service to a capitalist system when there is no option of ""no choice, or free choice"" as it simply will not regulate it self as there is no true free market to force competition.

No, this is not *fact*. This is *opinion*, and is one of the core differences between those with stereotypically left wing views, and those with stereotypically right wing views. The lefties believe everything is better run by, and paid for, by the state (ultimately requiring higher taxation), and the righties believe that as little as possible should be run by the state, and that people should not be forced to pay for things that they may choose not to use. If all you are doing is simply assuming that everyone shares your opinions, then you're wasting your time.

I think we got a solid shot at Champions League this year, the team appears to be getting into a groove under AVB and we certainly have the talent.

Why on earth would any politician want to tag himself to a system that has a 50% appeal success rate?  If it was government sanction they'd just order the 50% that don't win on appeal.  Clearly there is something wrong with the tests but Atos makes the tests.  Cameron hardly has to duck it, that's the system they inherited.  Nobody wins by having a lengthy and inefficient system with constant appeals and turn overs.  Not Atos, not the government, not the claimant.  Look at the girl in the video.  Nobody would ever want to put their name to stating that that girl was fit for work.  Anybody doing so would know straight away that there would be a media circus around it.  The point is that that's exactly the result the system spat out.

The DWP is a mess, a monstrosity of a department that looms in size over anything else.  If Cameron's to be criticised it's for not sinking his teeth into its top down reorganisation too, but then he has had a lot on his plate, not that I'm inclined to make excuses for him.

true,elerperger,null,null,"I will talk about genre, characterization, identity and mythology in Doctor Who. Here is my initial proposal: 

Mythology, Identity and Characterization in Doctor Who

Since the broadcast of the first episode of Doctor Who in 1963 nearly 50 years have passed and exactly 783 episodes later Doctor Who has become not only the most successful science fiction television series of all time but also the longest running science fiction television show. This thesis is to a large extent focused on the revived series of 2005 onwards and interested in the character of The Doctor and his development in this era. How both a series and a character can be kept alive and interesting for such a long time? How is it possible that this changing character is always perceived as the same? And how this character was revived and reshaped for changed television audiences in the 21st century? These were all core questions and interests that led to this final proposal.

The formula and character behind Doctor Who deserves academical study, especially since the premise of the series itself is quite simple: There is a man, called The Doctor, who travels through space and time with the help of a 1960s police box that is actually a time machine. This simple exposition has helped generations of viewers to find an easy approach into the ever growing texture of the series. The Doctor has to this date been played by eleven different actors yet he is always the same person with the same memories. This is due to the fact that if The Doctor’s life is threatened he has the ability to regenerate himself, to become a new person, a new incarnation of himself. This regeneration process was originally introduced as the original actor for the Doctor, William Hartnell, decided to leave the production in 1966 and was used ever since to introduce a new actor into the role. This transformation or reincarnation and its ramifications is one of the core interests of this diploma thesis as it represents both continuity as well as discontinuity in the character and the diegetic world of the series.

These phenomena prompt questions of identity and mythology with regard to the character of The Doctor whose personality has varied greatly over the tenure of the eleven Doctors and who has embodied many archetypical roles from the cranky, weird scientist that is the First Doctor to a Holmesian sleuth in the era of the Third Doctor and a Messianic “Lone God” archetype when David Tennant played the Tenth Doctor until 2010. This thesis intends to offer a thorough characterization of the seemingly paradoxical character of The Doctor by means of a textual analysis and a strong focus on the re-launched series. The Doctor’s regenerations do not only influence the character himself but to a degree also the direction and genre of the series – varying from science fiction to fantasy, gothic horror and even soap opera.

Tied to the character of The Doctor and his development are the inclusion of romance and (same sex) relationships in the immediate surroundings of The Doctor leading as far as showing the Eleventh Doctor himself as a possible queer character.

The Doctor has before been described as the “truest expression of Joseph Campbell’s Hero with a Thousand Faces ever conceived. The idea of an alien, come down to earth, repeatedly dying and resurrecting for the salvation of others is as close to the perpetual reenactment of the Hero’s Journey as you can hope to find.” (Cornell, Day and Topping 10) Therefor a further point of interest in this character study will be the mythological potential of The Doctor and Joseph Campell’s Hero with a Thousand Faces. In terms of myth theory this thesis will also be backed by myth theory as defined by Roland Barthes, Hans Blumenberg, Claude Levi-Strauss as well as Aleida and Jan Assman.

Preliminary Focal Points:

● Characterization, development and mythical potential of The Doctor (literary characterization, psychoanalytical aspects, archetypes theory)

● Development of the series and change and evaporation of the series genre (genre criticism)

● Changed sex and gender policies in the new series from 2005 onwards. The Doctor as a being with romantic interests and the celebration of same-sex relationships",0,1349366180,null,0,false,0,c6hk8vz,t3_10xgdo,t1_c6hk8vz,t1_c6hiat0,null,1430062842,14,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,14

true,ParrotofDoom,english,Greater Manchester,"&gt; Learning to drive is incredibly expensive (£25/hour+) and requires a lot of time (20 hrs+); they keep making the test harder and harder every year (which will add to the hours it takes) and even once you pass you're now greeted with a potential insurance bill which is more than the car's value PER YEAR.

20 * £25 is not incredibly expensive, it's pretty bloody cheap considering what it costs to run a car per year.  In fact it's almost negligible.  And the insurance cover isn't just for your car, its for all the other cars, walls, street furniture, pedestrians, cyclists, horses, etc - in other words, all the other things that your insurance company will have to pay for if you crash.

&gt; This suggestions wouldn't impact me or anyone I know because they couldn't afford to drive at 17. I literally knew nobody with a car who was below the age of 21. I knew tons of people who had a motorcycle however.

There are plenty of people that young who have jobs that allow them to run a car.  That's one of the decisions you have to make as an adult - if you want something, pay for it yourself.

&gt; I have no idea what this means and it isn't explained in the article. Everyone has to take the same test, they either pass or don't. How does it matter how you learnt to drive? Either through an intensive course or over weeks or months?

Because learning to drive a car continues for a very long time after you've taken your test, and it therefore stands to reason that the more time you spend with an instructor, the better chance you stand of being a more competent driver.

&gt; ""During this time the number of young passengers that a newly-qualified driver could carry would be restricted""
&gt; Care to show how this reduces the likelihoods of accidents? Or any justification for it supported by facts?

Usually because the last thing a driver says before he and his mates find themselves upside down in a ditch is ""WATCH THIS!""

&gt; No, fucking, way. Nobody should have to try and prove where they have been to the police. Plus what about if you're going to the airport, to the hospital, travelling, etc? Why does it matter where you've using your car to travel between? Plus 11pm to 4am, why those numbers? And why only the young?

Because that's when most young drivers kill themselves or others - out on rural roads, racing around like Nigel Mansell - except without the skills he has.

&gt; Only three times? Then why does an 18 year old pay almost 20x as much as a 48 year old on insurance?

Probably because an 18-year-old will be involved in a much more dramatic and expensive crash than a 48-year-old.

&gt; Cap on no-claims-bonuses. Limit to 5 years only. No discounts beyond that. Insurers cannot ask for a driver's claims history beyond that 5 year point or store it, or share it.

I haven't ever claimed on my car's insurance policy, despite driving 15-20,000 miles annually.  And I'm a member of the Institute of Advanced Motorists.  I think it's quite acceptable for my history of safe driving to be reflected by my insurance premium.

&gt; Insurers must spend 80% of the premiums on claims (and expenses related to claims, like rental cars). By law.

You think you can run a business on those margins?  LOL

&gt; Insurers cannot discriminate based on a driver's age (or gender, but already law)

I'm afraid the youthful ignorance demonstrated by your post is a perfect example of why insurance companies should be perfectly entitled to discriminate based upon age.

&gt; Insurers are capped on how much they can discriminate by address (e.g. up to +15% of the average for that area).

Right, because someone living in rural Scotland should pay about the same as someone living in central London.  That makes perfect sense.",0,1349366279,null,0,false,0,c6hk9wm,t3_10xj9c,t1_c6hk9wm,t1_c6hhjxg,null,1430062855,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

We have great options at CB even without Alex he wasn't a starter and we were trying to lower the average age of our squad, he's 30.

Stoch I haven't heard much about since his move to Fenerbache and it would have been difficult for him to get game time which is what he wanted at the time. A lot of game time.

Sinclair was fairly inconsistent and had a lot of loans. Playing consistently at Swansea for a few seasons obviously did him a world of good. However we all know we haven't been great as a club at bringing through the youth and the manager merry go round hasn't helped that.

Meireles was good backup but we had an over crowded midfield so wasn't surprised to see him go, not the sort of midfielder RDM wanted for the style of play being asked. Essen is just a loan not a sale but I can expect to see him go this summer. Will be sad but I don't think he's essential and he hasn't been for a couple seasons now.

Anyway, the reason for the intensive course was I was working in the US, and I wanted a real driving licence (in a manual) before taking the Texas DPS test (in an automatic).

Comparing the two, our British test is actually pretty good.

Many posts have come up here like I said, dissecting the episodes and determining that the episodes did in fact occur in the order we saw. Besides that, if he did go back after TATM, surely the show would have given us a hint of that. Instead, Amy says, essentially, we then lived happily ever after, just go talk to little 7-year-old me.

That's you speculation, here's mine. You know that any whistle blower first has a trial by media and a couple of years fighting legal battles severely curtailed Wikileaks operation whilst bleeding them dry financially. The financial blockade was utterly deliberate and political. At the time the Manning trial hadn't even started in earnest, and the various sociopathic acronyms in the US hadn't had time to do the investigations into Wikileaks, hold a grand jury, subpoena Twitter, Google and elsewhere, to churn out there 40k page document. The US couldn't have simply asked for a rendition because they was no evidence so no charges could have been brought - at that time at least. Apart from that the US is ran by spiteful bastards, one can only assume Mannings prolonged solitary confinement and veiled torture was supposed to prompt something.

I find it a bit hard to believe that Downing's talents suddenly disappeared as soon as he stepped into a red shirt. Surely there was a lot of pressure from the transfer fee. Dalglish admitted at times that Downing was played out of position. Rodgers apparently wasn't pleased with Downing's attitude.

Long story, short, it appears as if Downing simply doesn't have a place in this squad and what little we've seen of him, he simply hasn't impressed too often.

Unless Downing makes some very dramatic improvements (and even then any improvements will simply help his transfer value), I have a hard time believing that he will be around after the January window.

I know plenty will disagree with me here because of the argument 'if you're good enough to pass you test, you're good enough on the roads'. However, I think this is actually a decent proposal. With intensive driving courses I don't think that you get enough experience on the roads. By building up over several months you get the experience you need, on plenty of different roads, in plenty of different conditions. This I would support.

&gt;**During this time the number of young passengers that a newly-qualified driver could carry would be restricted**

I don't support this but it's probably a good idea. Having one or two friends in the car is fine, but a full car can be a distraction.

&gt;**They would also be banned from driving between 11:00pm and 4:00am for the first six months, unless they were driving to and from work or college**

This is a stupid idea. Why these times for young drivers? What if you need to go to hospital? What if you live in an extremely rural area like I do and the travelling time is much larger? Don't agree with this whatsoever. If it's to prevent drink driving then the times need to start much earlier to prevent it from happening. The entire attitude needs to change.

&gt;**There would be no blood alcohol allowed during those first six months**

I would completely support this as it's well intentioned and ultimately a beneficial idea. However, the reality is that it would be impossible and not cost-effective in reality. If it's to 
    
&gt;**Young drivers would be able to start learning earlier, at the age of 16 and a half**

Can't make my mind up about this. In many respects it's a good idea but also I don't see how much of a difference it would make, unless you just had to build up hours on the road which is when it becomes useful.

Or you could take an alternative definition by Michael Molloy.

&gt; Traditional dictionary definitions of *religion* read something like this: A system of belief that involves worship of a God or gods, prayer, ritual, and a moral code. But there are so many exceptions to that definition that it is neither comprehensive nor accurate. So instead of saying that a religion must have certain characteristics, it is now thought more useful to list a series of characteristics that are found in what are commonly accepted as religions. We may accept as a religion whatever manifests a reasonably number of these characteristics. Scholars do note, however, that what we ordinarily call religions manifest to some degree the following 8 elements:

&gt; * Belief system (or worldview)
&gt; * Community (belief system is shared)
* Central myths
* Ritual
* Ethics
* Characteristic emotional experiences
* Material expression
&gt; * Sacredness

Went to Muswell Hill primary, heart of North London, where your friends were entirely determined by whether you were a lilywhite or a gunner. I chose the former because my best mate, Joe, was a gooner.

Didn't think much of my choice until I started collecting football stickers, and amassed the entire spurs team (including shiney emblem) within a couple of weeks. I had about 18 Ruel Foxes and just stuck them one on top of the other.

So I had to be a yid.

Conservative predictions: 4th spot behind City, Chelsea and Arsenal (you heard it here first), Europa League Finalists, FA Cup Finalists. Chuck the Capital One in there too, why not.

Worst ever moment as a Yid was losing my Teddy Sheringham T-shirt (not even a spurs shirt, just a crap black t-shirt with Shezza pics all over) in Cornwall on holiday. Later, he left for united, and I felt like I was somehow responsible.

true,sandy_balls,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"Some countries have the age of consent at 12. Are the men that adhere to the laws of their land also paedophiles? Even in this country, before the age of consent was introduced, it was incredibly normal for grown men to take a wife no older than 14. It all comes down to when they matured into woman and that age is different for everyone. Men, by nature, become attracted to women when they reach puberty, you can't fault a man for that. Obviously in today's age, women mature mentally at a much older age and as such our laws reflect that, as does our morality. 

Now if we're talking about men that are attracted to *prepubescent* children, which goes against what nature intended, then it's a completely different thing. You can't tar men who are attracted to teenagers with the same brush as men who are attracted to children. It's just not a fair comparison. I'm not defending anyone here, just playing devils advocate, but all I've seen so far is Savile being accused of sexual relations with teenage girls and to me that doesn't make him a paedophile and it would be wrong to say otherwise.

*Top Gear* is very popular even with people who aren't huge car fans.
*Pointless* is an awesome game show.
*Dragons Den* is basically the British version of *Shark Tank*.
*Torchwood* for the *Doctor Who* fan, but make sure you've watched the series from Doctors 9 and 10 to get some backstory for it. Also there is the *Sarah Jane Adventures*, another spin-off.


Keep in mind there's nothing wrong with going back and watching series that aren't around anymore. *Merlin*, *Robin Hood*, *Vicar of Dibley*, *Gavin &amp; Stacey*, *Skins*, *The Catherine Tate Show*, *Peep Show*, *That Mitchell and Webb Look*... there are loads of good ones and many are on Netflix (even Instant play).


*Gavin &amp; Stacey* is one of my favorites.

The road was short and I didn't want to test the inevitable ""somebody overtakes at 60 so I'm trapped in the wrong lane"" situation.

When you can get minors like that it is unreasonable to limit it to 4/5.

The problem is, they treat you like *crap*, they torment you, twist your words, even outright lie about you and your conditions - then they scare you into not appealing even when it's obvious they have not looked at your case properly at all.

I'll copy and paste from when I was speaking about this earlier.

&gt;I personally cannot walk (at least, not at all well) due to a neurological condition nor efficiently steer my own wheelchair (co-ordination, weakness etc), but ATOS said I wasn't disabled because I could hold a spoon. That was literally one of only two things on my denial letter for DLA - ""Is able to hold cutlery"". I've heard others be told the same. The other thing was being told quite harshly in the letter that I can't apply for DLA 'just because I need money', which terrified the hell out of me into not appealing. 

I'll add to this that the *first* rejection letter I got stated that I could walk something like 300m. I cannot walk that far. I cannot walk a few metres without significant trouble. I am **homebound** the majority of the time due to this and not being able to afford a carer to take me out in a wheelchair - muscle weakness, poor-coordination etc means I can neither walk nor use a manual chair myself, nor am I allowed to utilise a motorised scooter. *It was an outright lie that I could walk*. When I informed them of this 'oversight', I got the second rejection letter about just cutlery and that part about how I can't get DLA 'just because I need money'. 

&gt;But I wont deny that the whole process makes me very uncomfortable. The ATOS guy who came for my DLA assessment didn't seem to be a doctor - and actually made 'grossed out' faces when I had to tell him personal details of my disability. I started crying halfway through the assessment. It's honestly horrible to get those assessments.

What do I propose they do? Not lie about an applicant being able to walk when they cannot, and then ignoring their disability entirely for the sake of being able to hold cutlery. I propose that the assessments should be held by people *properly* medically trained, who wont go 'Eurgh' when I'm talking about very personal issues that I'm already embarassed to have to talk about. I propose they don't use threats of accusing people of 'just wanting money' to scare people away from applying for help they need. I propose that they actually handle these cases with dignity and fairness, and **accurately**.

People arn't committing suicide because the 'checks upset them'. People are committing suicide because of how disgusting and dehumanising this process is. If I had a mental health issue, the impact on me would have been MUCH worse. I don't even have a mental health issue and I felt utterly shit about how I was treated.

He moved on loan. I assume **Chelsea** won't keep him past this season, nor do I think **Real Madrid** will sign him on a full-time contract. His ageing power really only fits two of the five leagues: **Italy** (their general tempo means he'll be dynamic and extremely strong; see **Kevin Prince Boateng** and **Asamoah**) and **France** (lots of muscular box-to-box / defensive midfielders with less technique than **Essien**; excess demand for his type). Since he has done Ligue 1, I'd expect he'd happily try to do a **Vieira** in Serie A, instead. **Juventus** seems like a good fit; they play 3 CMs, 1 playmaker, two box-to-box semi-technical destroyers in **Marchisio** and **Vidal**. He'd fit their system, and could even do a job as a back-up RWB if **Isla/Liechtsteiner** get bored of sitting on the bench and demand a move away.

Not that I have any real clue, but logically it makes sense. If he proves himself fit this year at Real Madrid, his agent should immediately get on trying to get him a move down to Italy for a decent wage.

&gt;To this day I'll still stay in behind a truck if I think some idiot will decide to snail crawl past them and make me miss my junction.

Same here - if I'm 1/4 mile from my turnoff I will slip in behind whatever car is in the inside lane, regardless of speed.  Or you will go to pass someone who is doing 50mph on a 70mph road, and just as you are level with them they will speed up to make it hard to pass.  

My dads friend is like that, if someone overtakes him he sees it as a personal insult and will do his level best to then overtake them - too many assholes on the road.

My old car (Peugout 207 SW) had amazing acceleration and I could floor it and get past even the assholes if there was plenty time, but with my new car (Qashqai) it doesn't have the 'pull' so I have to drive more conservatively.

true,waydee,null,null,"What always strikes me is how good British drivers are, and I do have experience of living abroad to base that on.

Our roads are remarkably safe, the stats prove that driving in the UK is comparatively much safer than pretty much everywhere and given our population/car ownership rate and the often hazardous nature of our roads (many narrow, twisty, poorly lit etc) I'd say that licensing requirements are doing an excellent job.

I realise learning to drive is expensive and time consuming but believe it has to be. I don't agree with allowing the private insurance industry the right to set the price of motoring however and believe that it would be much fairer if a basic level of third party insurance was included in road tax.

Seventeen year old boys are always going to find ways to kill themselves, its unfortunate but it's also quite rare even though pretty much everyone can name someone who died young in a car crash.  

I don't really see the need for a reduced license for young people, you can't inconvenience everybody because of young lads wrapping corsas around trees.  Immediately after passing your test you're still very much a learner driver and it takes many years, and possibly many incidents to learn from before you can even begin to consider yourself accomplished, even then there's a bloody good chance you'll crash in a bad way some time in your life.

As above, my biggest concern is uninsured drivers because I know there is a huge amount on the roads and they're often those same freshly passed seventeen year olds who would otherwise have an insurance policy if the cost of such a thing was in any way reasonable.

Just kidding. AVB was giving good direction, switching players around to try and shift focus in the game, and made the right subs. I wouldn't have started with both Dawson and Huddlestone, they're too slow, but Gallas and Sandro were most definitely too tired. 

My only gripe with the way AVB built the team was including Huddlestone over Livermore. I would rather have seen Livermore in so our wingbacks could press forward without having to recover as quickly. He would also keep Panatha's mid from being able to press forward as they started doing second half. 

All in all, it was a result we deserved, really. We put in a goal and then got complacent. I believe that complacency has a lot to do with many of the players on the field having played during the United match, too. Even Dembele looked tired out there, and that guy can play two matches back to back. 

We gave the match against United 150% effort and paid for it with a complacent, tired side.  

As long as we do well in the league, we're fine. 

I'm also pretty positive we'll pass out of the group. Maribor and Panthinaikos will drop. I doubt either team will be able to beat is at the Lane. We'll have to settle with no less than a draw away at either Maribor or Lazio. 

Draw at Lazio and Maribor with two home wins will seal the deal, IMO. Panathinaikos will no doubt lose away to Lazio and will probably lose to them in Athens, too. 

Don't stress, people. Players are tired. We just beat United in Old Trafford. It was never going to be that same level of play as we had last weekend, our boys are tired. And I'd rather see them play complacent and get an away draw coupled with a win in the league on the weekend, to be honest.

I totally agree. Doctor Who IS about all those things. I started watching the show at 9, but have not had a chance to go back and watch all of Original Who, so I can't speak to what I assume is going to be incredibly cheesy and dated awesomeness. But, I feel like one of the highlights of the show WAS their ability to slip in episodes or storylines like Blink and ""Bad Wolf,"" and do them well, then get back to Hospitals being teleported to the moon and rhino cops searching for an escaped plasmavore. 

ATM was neither of those. It tried to be a Blink-esque dramatic episode AND be an entertaining and emotionally charged episode, and didn't succeed at either IMO.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"Tom really needs a midfield basically built around him in order to not be a liability in defense. We desperately missed a mobile ball-winner. If Sandro played 90 minutes we would have probably won and maybe scored another goal on the counter. 

Hudd did some good stuff in the first half but once Pan. started actually attacking us he was basically a bystander. Guy just cannot recover to save his life. If he moves forward at all and we concede possession he just gets bypassed.

If we played Hudd as the anchor of a 4-3-3 with Sandro on one side and Mousa on the other, I think he'd do alright. But I don't think we should be building our team around him, so I agree with you. 

Daws is frustrating too. So many aimless long balls out of play and as you pointed out Gallas or Caulker or Younes easily cuts that ball out on the cover. He's a good tough player and of course he has ""immense human dimension"" but he doesn't read the game well enough to make up for his pace. John Terry gets away with being slow as fuck because he reads the game brilliantly. The guy makes Huddlestone look like Bale.

It doesn't exist any more. It's been trasnformed into ESA and ALL of those coming from Incap are having to be tested by ATOS.

&gt; However if you look at what he originally said, some days she's absolutely fine and he talks about sores appearing on joints restricting mobility. If that's the case and she's not living in wracked in pain (and how are you able to say what the case is), and she's not useless and constantly bedridden then it's a fact that the 2012 workplace is completely different for the disabled than it was even ten years ago, and it's time that was reflected.

No idea what world you live in buddy, but it's not one that's grounded with this one. The workplace has evolved and the disabled are more likely to work with able-bodied persons. Hell until a few weeks ago I worked within a local council and I now work for a larger part of the government. However I still saw someone who had a lot of time off due to a complicated illness get the sack by HR simply because of that... she had time off due to an on-going medical problem. The workplace has evolved, employers and attitudes haven't. If you're going to be a liability with no firm grasp on WHEN or WHERE you are able to work then you are of no use to them, simple as.

&gt; As it is I'm hearing she can't wear office clothes and would be a health hazard in an office. Who mentioned the office?

She can barely walk some-days. Damn you're cold. Wake yourself up on Saturday when you haven't got work and task yourself with not using your entire right arm for that day. Use it as a test to show what it would be like to be disabiled. Make sure you don't think ""Ha, do nothing all day and watch TV"" because then you'll prove my point.

&gt; Sorry. It sounds like excuses

Come work with the disabled, those who can't work due to physical and mental illness. I guarantee that ideal will change buddy. Failing that imagine your spouse becoming ill with something serious and how that would affect them... do you want them working from home? do you want them suffering just because of your previous views?

A lot of illnesses are inconsistent, you might feel good one day, then have a week where you are in too much pain to get out of bed. How can you get a job when you cannot be reliable? What if your company has deadlines they have to meet, but you are likely to be unable to work at short notice, at almost any time?

Seems to me that perhaps she could do some unix work, or telesales, but it would have to be something that she was able to do while she was able, and not do when she felt worse. That would have to be for a company that would accept that. Meanwhile would she be paid when ill? That'd be a bit of a burden on any company. So she'd probably need some sort of benefits when she was worse. So what then, how does that work, how much does it cost to administer?

There's obviously a line to be drawn between those who can work and those who can't, and that line seems to have got blurred, from both sides.

true,ibpants,1972crest,,"Yeah, it's too early to say quite how Sinclair is doing for us, but in a direct comparison with Adam Johnson I'd say that Sinclair looks to be more versatile (can go inside *or* outside his man and can cross), and puts in more work defensively.  He's promising, and for me he's a better wide option than the 3-5-2 - that shit just doesn't want to fly.

We've seen more of Rodwell, but not where I expect he will ultimately flourish.  Despite him already having transitioned from a centre half to a defensive midfielder, he's a big strong lad and I've been expecting him to play more box-to-box (a la Yaya).  So far we've only seen him playing the Barry role and he's a little too green to be allowed that much defensive responsibility - especially when both of our full backs are pushing up.  We've seen him make silly mistakes which are extremely costly with the open nature of our style (the fact that many people completely miss all of Barry's work is testament to how good he is in such precarious role).

I'm reluctant to judge Rodwell until I've seen him deputise for Yaya a few times (which may happen soon if Yaya's hobbling last night is anything to go by) because I think he could do well.",0,1349384161,null,0,false,0,c6hp70i,t3_10ye9m,t1_c6hp70i,t3_10ye9m,null,1430065240,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

For one, you mention tattoos and piercings. You could consider them my one luxury. I have never drank, smoked, gambled, anything one could consider a vice (not that I have anything against anyone who does, we have one life, what enjoyment can be wrung from it should be). To get these modifications I have to get so drugged up on Diazepam (which I have been on since I was ten, so it takes rather a lot to fell me these days). I am helped to the car by my mother who is my carer, and manoeuvred into which ever position is needed where I will remain until I'm done, when I will go home, sleep for the rest of the day and spend the next day 'coming down' and having panic attacks. It's far from ideal. 

I would love, LOVE to have a job. Delivering pizza menus? God, yes, give me that, let me earn my money. But when one is entirely housebound, it becomes rather more difficult. My sister just had a baby and I cannot even go see her. My brother has gone off to university to study Medicine, and here I sit, utterly paralysed by this inexact fear of the outside. 

I am lucky to have a supportive family who probably would continue to support me if my benefits were removed and I couldn't afford to feed myself or pay rent. But would I want that? Would I want to eat into my mother's meagre wages from cleaning toilets? No. So yes, I probably would kill myself. Consider that extreme if you will, but I consider it the very least I could do.  

I do not mean this response rudely, just as a way of explaining myself. I struggle with communication due to other disorders I won't go into, so I hope this allows you to understand me a little better.

But the Doctor was attached to Amy in a way we haven't seen yet. (At least not on New Who, I'm only halfway through season 2 of Classic Who.) He willingly gave up the other companions for their own good. He sent Rose away when they were finally together. He didn't fuss when Martha left. He reluctantly, but resolutely erased himself from Donna. Even with Susan, his granddaughter, he left her behind so she didn't have to choose to stay with him out of obligation. Amy, on the other hand, he  begged and plead with her to stay with him, even though he knew what Amy and Rory meant to each other. For once, he was being selfish about it.  

Given the sort of character we saw Jenna-Louise play in Oswin, I think she'll likely pay Clara in a similar cheeky, clever character. However, her role in regards to him, I think she's the one who'll ""fix"" the Doctor. So far this season, we've seen the Doctor act uncharacteristically of himself.

A lot of people will just get rid of old broken phones because they can easily get new ones on their insurance or whatever, so they go for very little on eBay. If you can get parts for a good price and follow the tutorials, you can easily fix up the phones and double your money.

A good way to get cheap parts is to scour eBay for ""joblots"" of phones, which will be a bulk sale of many broken phones. Often the sellers will have no idea what works and what doesn't on these phones, so in many cases it wouldn't be worth it replacing every part to try and repair them, but often you'll be able to use the working parts in these to fix other phones and it's better value than buying those parts individually.

Once you do this for a bit you'll get a feel for what devices are the most profitable and easiest to fix and how to get the cheapest parts and you'll be well away. You won't make a living overnight but as you invest more time and money into it you can make a surprisingly large amount of profit.

Today when it's just Allen and Hendo playing the holding 2 is when that problem(sideways passes) becomes a little more prevalent.

true,Dossena,null,null,"Oh the calamity... becoming a bit too typical though. Totally bossed the first half but didn't put away the chances we created. Then totally fell asleep at the start of the second half and couldn't recover quick enough - took them getting 3 goals for us to get motivated again. Couple of poor mistakes leading to 2 of their goals - though not to take away from some superb work from Di Natale, he was class. When we did wake up we played well again and made plenty more chances, just unlucky to not score from them. Not helped by the ref mind - Borini and Suarez were both wrestled to the ground in the box, and the rugby tackle on Downing should probably have been a red (no intent at getting the ball, and you could argue stopped a goal-scoring opportunity). Plus he blew the final whistle too early. Bastard. 

Thoughts on some of the players: 

Suarez - What a goal! Just what the team needed to get pumped back up. Was fantastic and could have had a couple more goals had lady luck been shining on him today. 

Coates - A real shame to have got the own goal because other than that he was having a cracking game. Was solid at the back and made some great/important clearances and interceptions

Downing - Very good performance from him. Is lacking confidence but gave it his all - going forward and tracking back when needed. Great work to pick out Shelvey for the goal. If his confidence was higher I reckon he would have scored from that late shot he had. 

Shelvey - Brilliant in the work up and scoring of the first goal. Played well throughout, was unlucky to have got in the way of Suarez's shot. 

Henderson - A bit quiet but had some nice link-up play with Jonjo again.

Borini - May not have scored but played a big part in the goal (him dragging defenders away allowed Jonjo the space to score) and was making good runs throughout the game. 

Johnson - Decent performance but, is it just me, or does anyone think he's better at LB than RB now?

Sterling - The boy that keeps giving. Great to have that kind of energy brought on at that stage of the game, and he was unlucky to not have scored, with some more experience he'll soon be putting away chances.


Overall it was a good performance from the team for the most part. With the chances created and way we played we didn't deserve to lose... then again I guess we didn't deserve to win either after falling to sleep and letting the score 3 goals, we really need to sort our defence out.

true,SpottieOttieDopalis,lfc68,,"As great as Steve Clarke was last year, our defensive form dropped in the second half of the season, around the same time Lucas went down.

 Like you said the majority of opponents goals have been from our mistakes. A team can be drilled to a T, but at some point human error comes into effect. I think it's mostly due to the defense focusing on keeping possession and keeping a higher line. It's leading to lapses in judgement and counter attacks. Ultimately I think it'll be figured out, just as the offense has come into it's own, I think the defense will do the same soon.

We defended pretty well today actually, aside from the goals. Their first 2 were from our mistakes, Johnson's errant touch and Coates own goal. The 3rd, well that was just shit defending, but my point still stands. We really didn't give them many opportunities defensively, we gave them opportunities from our mistakes. If we can cut out the mistakes and get Lucas back, I have faith the defense will get back to where it was last year.

I personally wouldn't have put Milner in there.

true,themotherfuckingfox,eng-Suffolk,Suffolk County,"We seem to have had very different life experiences. I am lucky in as much as no-one is threatening to, you know, kill my mum. I don't really know how to explain this to you in terms you'll understand, we obviously have different views on mental illness and what it entails. The 'it gets easier if you keep doing it' routine is often trotted out, and for some people, does work. For me? I spent most of my school life being forced into school, throwing up, passing out, because my parents believed that if I just kept it up, it would get easier. You know what happened? I got worse. By being forced into a situation I couldn't handle day-in day-out, I became more anxious, more depressed, to the point where I was considered a suicide risk by my doctor. Why didn't I? Well, back then, I was naive, I honestly believed my mother when she told me life would get better, get to college, and you'll be surrounded by better people and you'll enjoy yourself. And these promises kept coming. It is only now when I am able to compare myself to my younger siblings and their achievements, and my rather pitiful little lot in life that I realise things don't get better. Other people may well have more of a desire to live, but for me, every day is a period of time to live through until I can sleep again (because in sleep, I can do whatever I want, and that is truly freeing). 

People often think they'd enjoy spending all day on the computer, watching television, whatever. You have no idea how lonely it becomes, how utterly worthless you begin to feel. Anxiety (and all my other co-morbids that hop on for the ride) is not something you can snap out of, despite what people think. It is little understood, and awareness of the problems it can cause is low. You don't hear about agoraphobics because we're not able to shout about our cause. 

I don't know what I'm saying here. I suppose you're trying to be supportive, to get me to 'buck up', I'm trying to explain it's not as easy as you make it sound, or more people would do it. The last time I saw my psychologist he put me on medication so strong to try to calm me, that I would take it and four hours later would have to go back to bed, because it knocked me out. And I was supposed to take it twice a day. Four hour days aren't my idea of a life. But having been through the usual suspects, prozac, citalopram, diazepam, ideas run out. 

I don't know why I can't just leave this alone. It's like picking a scab. I suppose I'm trying to make it clear how low I am, how after a lifetime of this I cannot cope with any more. If my benefits were removed, and that is what this is all about, after all, I would not be financially independent, I would not be able to buy my own food, I would not be able to pay rent, I would not be able to buy books for my nephew, and it certainly wouldn't force me to work.

Now if she is not capable of working even at home - fair enough.  Nobody is arguing, or has ever argued, that there should be no disability pay whatsoever.  What is being argued is that the workplace has effectively changed and work which in previous years required somebody to leave their home and head to an office need not be so today, and as such the benefit system should reflect this.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yes, nowadays, many disabled people are being advised to 'write what it's like on your *worst* days'. I don't agree with that, and I don't think many other people with genuine problems do either. I mean, I can't speak for them all, but it just doesn't sit right with me. I think people should be bluntly honest about what it's like for them the grand majority of the time, with a mention that it can get worse sometimes if it does - and that should be taken into consideration if 'worst days' happen often in a way that affects daily living/work.

To be honest.. I don't know how anyone in their right mind would feel safe trying to straight out exaggerate. It's scary enough trying to get them to accept your *actual* condition without them accusing you of exaggerating - even if they met you face to face in an examination and have medical records everywhere and doctors statements.

I think there's more of a problem with people *downplaying* their issues in the hopes that this way it doesn't look 'too extreme' and they'll more likely be believed - as most able-bodied people can't imagine that anyone would have problems lifting a pint glass of liquid, for example, and act disbelieving when you tell them you can't (until they've watched you try a few times). Plus, you have the embarrassment of admitting you cannot do normal things. ATOS or not, it's much more comfortable to allow others in day to day life and relationships to think you're more capable than you are .. just so they don't look at you funny, disbelieve you.. or, if they are close to you, even get sad for you. It becomes habit, and being blunt about it is something you have to learn to be comfortable with.

I remember my examination with the ATOS person. He asked me to grip a pen, so I did. I gripped it as I normally would, in a way that I was able to do so. He said 'No no! Grip it properly! Grip it harder!' so I strained in a way that both hurt and I couldn't sustain, with all my concentration for a couple of seconds before he took it away. I thought this was fine, I thought he was.. I don't know, just monitoring how my hand shook or something from the grip? Like he needed to see me strain, to see how my strength/dexterity faired.. or even just the movement of my hand. I just followed his instructions. I only got told after the fact that him saying 'grip properly, harder' meant he wanted to see me grip a pen as securely as any other person so he could write down that I could do it, and I should have been blunt that 'gripping properly' was straining and something I could not do on a constant basis, and that I grip writing tools my own way which may or may not be considered efficient.

People should just be bluntly and wholly honest on the forms and with their evidence, and in examinations. Speak up if they ask you to do something you cannot properly do all the time, or if something hurts. No exaggerations, no downplaying. That way, if you feel you get unfairly declined and decide to go to appeal, you can have the confidence that the independent tribunal will treat you fairly and there's nothing to be ashamed of.

Edit: And people should get ATOS medical examinations sound recorded. It's legal to do this in your own home, and should be listened to if you request it at an examination elsewhere.",0,1349394800,null,0,1349395478,0,c6hrw9u,t3_10xkve,t1_c6hrw9u,t1_c6hp1ro,null,1430066515,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,themotherfuckingfox,eng-Suffolk,Suffolk County,"I think the government have done a very good job of painting people on benefits in a very negative light. There's always an air of suspicion surrounding them and programmes like 'Saints &amp; Scrougers' don't help. Granted, there are people on benefits who don't deserve it, but a larger proportion **do**, and if £50 a week is the difference between having some form of sustainable, independent life or not, then it seems petty to withhold it because there are some people abusing the system. 

As far as I'm aware there aren't any organised movements against it. I suppose the current financial climate doesn't help matters, it often is better to be on benefits than to work, so there's resentment there. And of course, if you're well enough to complain about your benefits, you're well enough to work, as the logic goes. 

I think we walk a tricky line. Get too noisy and the spotlight gets shone on you, stay too quiet and risk losing even more. It's an awkward situation nobody wants to be in, and treating 'us' (I say us, people on benefits) as criminals, fraudsters, lazy and selfish, is a way of dehumanising us and is very damaging to society.

I agree, but if you're honest about what you're like in your day-to-day life you'll get fuck all. And then what? Sure, you can appeal it like you say, but why waste time on that - time in which you won't get anything - when what everyone does, and what even the charities for various disabilities will tell you to do, is describe the worse case scenario?

I've heard the exact same thing - ""write what you're like on your worst days."" It's a shitty way to measure the extent of your day-to-day needs but at a time when people who need constant care are told to fuck off to work, it's the only way you can have a reasonable chance of getting anything at all, and it'll surely get worse when DLA is scrapped altogether and replaced with whatever it is the government have decided is ""better.""

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I think the government have done a very good job of painting people on benefits in a very negative light.

The government have to be given credit for how much genius went into that.

During recessions, the current government has to deal with rising unemployment and rising inflation. The rising unemployment is necessary because not only does it decrease inflation but even Marx agrees that a certain level of unemployment is required for an economy to run well.

The downside, of course, is that this also means the government has to spend more on benefits, which is bad at the moment since the deficit *must be paid off right now!*

This all makes the public angry, so the opposition obviously claims to have the magical answer to all these issues. With these empty promises being broadcast all over the media and rising discontent with the current government, they will then get voted in only for everyone to realise that was all bullshit. The economy keeps getting worse and the reputation of the party suffers.

So what does the government do? They can't increase spending because of the deficit, they can't decrease unemployment even though they've tried to many times, they can't even raise interest rates without fear of a big boom in inflation.

They must invent a scapegoat. An enemy. A distraction.

So they turn to the people who are suffering as a result of the economic situation. The unemployed and the disabled. They demonise these people subtly and let the media do the rest.

Now the media fusses about benefit cheats every day, and the government is using this to reduce benefit spending, but where are all these benefit cheats? Only 4% of benefit claimants are supposedly getting it dishonestly and the government's own website claims benefit fraud costs £1.2 billion a year. £1.2 billion for the government is chump change.

But now when unemployment rises, they can use this as an excuse to further cut spending. When the economy doesn't do too well and growth drops, it's because of all these scroungers. Forget that government spending is the biggest component of GDP and that the money given as benefits is invested back into the economy and the private sector, it's all being ruined by benefit cheats!

The governments (both Labour and Conservative) have successfully deflected their own failures onto the population and very few people have noticed.

It's genius.",0,1349396805,null,0,false,0,c6hsd0m,t3_10xkve,t1_c6hsd0m,t1_c6hry5u,null,1430066733,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

The information he provided was that there was flair ups and mobility was sometime an issue, he later added that office clothes were an issue and there was a 'cleanliness' issue regarding blood, for want of a better word - even though I was raising the issue of no longer having to work either outdoors or in an office to find employment.  I addressed the specific points he raised regarding the problems with employment.

I referred directly to a case example *that someone else raised*.

It wasn't even remotely hostile and you're feigning injury all too easily and reading into things which aren't even there.

Again, why shouldn't disability payments reflect how things have changed?  It's common sense.

In france they have heavy legs condition, in italy a gust od wind can lay you up in bed with a cold, veterans become more prone to vietnam syndrome when they are expected to have it. The symptoms of ptsd have changed vastly, people manifest the symptoms in accordance with societal expectations.

In africa there have been pandemics of men believeing someone has stole their penis, in the middle ages their were laughing and dancing plagues that killed people.

Why do the french get heavy leg syndrome and we dont? Why does the incidence drop when the treatments are no longer covered by their medical insurance?

Why dont we get african mental diseases and a speak kn tongues and and why dont they get ours? If these are real medical conditions why are they uniform. 

You dont see many people in the the Ukraine or africa with agoraphobia and ME, they are welfare state diseases.

Yes, you're right. I got carried away along the lines of 'This is how I would hope it works!' rather than how it actually does.

And you're probably right about the ATOS assessors too. It's pretty wrong to assume and make pre-judgements that all ATOS employees are 'the same' (wrong of me to assume, I mean). ATOS employee or not, not every single human *individual* has it in them to treat people in such a way. It's not like ATOS puts a chip in their heads and makes them jerks towards people with problems or different needs. They're paid to make notes, and as you say that's probably exactly what a lot of them do. But I do personally feel embarrassment when talking openly about certain things to anyone - DWP, ATOS, friend, even family member I feel embarrassed incase I get some sort of 'ick' or 'wtf?' reaction, and this is probably just me - but getting a 'capability assessor' who is supposedly medically trained (to the extent they're said they need to be) doing that doesn't really make me feel more comfortable.

The arguments advanced by the Levellers during the early English Civil War on property and civil and political rights, such as the right to vote, informed subsequent debates in other countries. The Levellers emerged as a political movement in mid 17th Century England in the aftermath of the Protestant Reformation. They believed that property which had been earned as the fruit of one's labour was sacred under the Bible's commandment ""thou shall not steal"". As such they believed that the right to acquire property from one's work was sacred. Levellers views on the right to property, and the right not to be deprived of property as a civil and political right, were developed the pamphleteer Richard Overton.[24] In ""An Arrow against all Tyrants"" (1646) Overton argued that:

""To every individual in nature is given an individual property by nature not to be invaded or usurped by any. For everyone, as he is himself , so he has a self propertiety, else he could not be himself; and of this no second may presume to deprive of without manifest violation and affront to the very principles of nature of the rules of equity and justice between man and man. Mine and thine cannot be, except this. No man has power over my rights and liberties, and I over no man.""

true,psychotic_chocolate,tardis,TARDIS,"1) The sonic screwdriver doesn't work if something has been deadlocked, or it is made of wood.

2) There is some debate about this. It has been said in the classic episodes that a Time Lord can only have 12 regeneration. However there are exceptions, so we don't know for sure whether the Doctor will be able to regenerate after that.

3) It was a Chameleon Arch. Opening the fob watch turned him back into a Time Lord.

4) The watch has his Time Lord essence (or whatever you want to call it) and it's quite powerful, and it does want to be opened. So it has the ability to make other people hear it.

5) Between episodes The Doctor and his companion do go on other adventures where nothing goes wrong, but an episode of that would be pretty boring. Also keep in mind that sometimes he goes places because he's answering calls. Other times he just stuffs up and goes somewhere he didn't mean to.

6) Think about it - if it happened to you, you'd probably just think you hadn't noticed it before. And then why do people ignore it? People ignore all kinds of weird things because they're too busy with their lives. Even if they did go to check it out, they wouldn't be able to get in.

7) Doctor Who movies? If you're referring to the Paul McGann movie from 1996 that obviously goes before the new series. I'm assuming you mean the specials. So they go at the end of season 4. Season 4 ends with The Stolen Earth/Journey's End. The order of the specials is: The Next Doctor, Planet of the Dead, The Waters of Mars, The End of Time Part 1, The End of Time Part 2. After these you can start season 5 with The Eleventh Hour.

4)The watch contained the Doctor's essence, which in itself is in some way sentient and is reaching out to the boy because it knows he is necessary
5)The episodes only show the really interesting bits, more reference is made to this as the series progresses, it is made clear throughout the series that there is a lot that goes on off screen. But the Doctor also has a habit of getting in trouble, so his adventures are common as well.
6)Perception filters. The instant the TARDIS lands it subtly effects the perception of everyone around, it making them think that it has always been there.
7) Most of the movies predate the new series and thus are fine to watch in whatever order.

There were many soldiers at that time who never thought they would have to go out on patrol. Now they are explicitly told they will but when recruitment was tough they would take about anyone and say anything. We ended up with a few commonwealth troops in support trades who thought it would all be rear echelon canapés and mess dos for the officers. 

Initially the infantry wouldn't take anyone, even volunteers, out on a multiple but quickly had to make up.the numbers. Some of the medics had to do back to back patrols. 

And sadly its not like CoD or bravo two zero, its scary. Lots of nigs when under fire will just hit the deck and wont return fire, it will either go on for so long they will get a kick up the arse and made to or just suppress and extract. 

When you say soldier people assume elite infantry badasses, most are not. Lots of fat 3c, IT bods and signals out there on patrol, they make up numbers but day to.day a lot never see the range outside MATTs.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"Oh, I completely agree, it is easily explained away why The Doctor doesn't just tow away the spaceship. Along with your explanation, you also have the fact that The TARDIS doesn't always work properly(The magic tow system could very well be broken right now), as well as The Doctor's own personality of wanting an adventure, and wanting to find out what's on the ship before actually solving the problem of it hitting Earth.

I just don't think it *needs* to be explained. I think it's good enough that it didn't fit the episode, so it wasn't used. And there isn't always going to be an explanation of why The Doctor doesn't use something he used in a previous episode outside of 'Because it's already been done' or 'It would have ruined the story'. Especially when you have a story that's been running for almost 50 years, I'm sure there's almost always an easy solution you can find somewhere in there for anything The Doctor has done. Hell, the Fast Return Switch would have probably fixed half of David Tennant's episodes, but you simply don't see people complaining about it because most New Who fans have no clue what that is.

I also agree with The Doctor becoming way too powerful. RTD had built him up to some kind of DC comic book hero that has no weakness, the perfect moral compass, and always saves the day. I don't like that, and I don't think any character should be perfect and without flaws, let alone The Doctor. The best Doctor Who stories are the ones where you see The Doctor's flaws. One of my favorite 1st Doctor stories was The Edge of Destruction, because you see The Doctor just flip his lid. He has no idea what's going on, and takes it out on everyone around him. Claiming his companions, who have very little understanding of the TARDIS(Hell, at this point, he doesn't even have much understanding of the TARDIS), and he's blatantly accusing them of sabotaging the TARDIS console.

I also just recently got finished with a most brilliant 8th Doctor story that is very much the opposite. His love for his companion is what got in the way of him doing the 'right thing' and properly fixing the universe. The entire time everyone pressured him, even his companion, to 'do the right thing' and sacrifice her for the sake of time and space, and he continued to refuse. I won't say much more, but man it was brilliant, and perfectly highlighted the flaws of a 'Perfect man' who is simply trying to do the right thing by not sacrificing one of his bestest friends in the universe. And while I'm not trying to spoil anything, in the case you decide to ever listen to this amazing story, I will say that it doesn't end with your typical RTD 'The Doctor finds a way to make everyone happy, and everyone walks away unscathed' manner, and there's definitely some dire consequences to him refusing to give up his companion.",0,1349414282,null,0,false,0,c6hwksi,t3_10yy05,t1_c6hwksi,t1_c6hw7vu,null,1430068784,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

Look at the Swiss or scandinavian governments for excellent examples of how to run services.

It's called SAD - seasonal affective disorder.

From Wikipedia: In many species, activity is diminished during the winter months in response to the reduction in available food and the difficulties of surviving in cold weather. Hibernation is an extreme example, but even species that do not hibernate often exhibit changes in behavior during the winter. It has been argued that SAD is an evolved adaptation in humans that is a variant or remnant of a hibernation response in some remote ancestor. Presumably, food was scarce during most of human prehistory, and a tendency toward low mood during the winter months would have been adaptive by reducing the need for calorie intake. The preponderance of women with SAD suggests that the response may also somehow regulate reproduction.",0,1349418438,null,0,1349427522,0,c6hxavx,t3_10zbf4,t1_c6hxavx,t3_10zbf4,null,1430069126,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

At least on screen, the only thing that had really been mentioned to him is that The Doctor took them on trips instead of them going to Ireland for their honeymoon. Nothing was said about spending years, let alone an entire decade, running around with The Doctor.

And the New York trip happened in 2012 because Moffat likes important stories like this to take place during important years. Especially with The Ponds. Look at The Eleventh Hour. Amy was born 1989(Year Doctor Who was put on hiatus), first met The Doctor in 1996(Year of the TV movie), saved the world from Prisoner Zero in 2008(Year it was officially announced Moffat was taking over Doctor Who), and Amy became a companion in 2010(The actual year Eleventh Hour aired in).

There's no real story reason as to why the times take place when they do outside the fact that Moffat loves adding relevant dates to the show. The Ponds officially left in 2012, so the episode in which they had their departure initially started in 2012.

And besides, they're in a time machine, why not go to New York in 2012? Maybe New York 2022 sucks, or they wanted to see a particular play going on in 2012.

true,TragedyT,tardis,TARDIS,"But this is also the thing about taste.  What you set out as your rules of 'whats important' only apply to you.  For me, J.K. Rowling's consistency of her rules were unimportant, as I found her writing so excruciatingly dull and unimaginative that I never made it past the third Harry Potter book.

Similarly with Doctor Who, this consistency that's so important to you is to me a massively distant second to *fun*.

For me, the very existence of the Weeping Angels is utterly ludicrous if you even think about their basic set up for a moment, so that I'm already in la-la land and loving it.  They're *not* written as a hard-core SF concept to be explored in a series of spin-off novels, they're written as the nightmare boogeyman in the closet that will scare the crap out of your children.

I tend to look at Doctor Who stories as tales told by a madman in a straight jacket.  Some of it could be true, but who cares?  The point is in the telling, in the rollercoaster ride of laughs and scares, not in any idea of verisimilitude - who cares about that when you can have dinosaurs on a spaceship?

true,CopreaVonDedd,null,null,"It was a good article until he said the Doctor stole the TARDIS to escape the Time War. That's just plain incorrect information. Then everything after that was either wrong or misinformed; particularly the part where he said it was never touched upon why the Doctor would hate himself so much. For one, it kind of has been touched on. Many times. The Doctor is responsible for the deaths of countless people, and directly brought about the extinction of his own race. That alone would be enough to make a person hate themselves.

Secondly, I don't like that the article tries to say that time is finite. The Doctor said, not two weeks ago that ""this is one corner in one country in one continent in one planet that's a corner of a galaxy that is a corner of a universe that is forever growing and shrinking and creating and destroying and never remaining the same for a single millisecond. And this is so much, SO MUCH, to see,"" and that's just the universe in current time. That doesn't even mention that he still has everything he just said, but throughout the entire span of time. He will never run out of adventures.

Even if New York were effectively ""roped off,"" he'd still never run out of adventures, but that line itself is also not true.

He can still go to New York, just not during that year.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"That wasn't in Power of Three, though. Rory mentions that he's 30 years old to his dad during Dinosaurs, shortly after Brian found out who The Doctor was in the first place. If there was a time for him to question how his son became 10 years older, that would have been it, but Brian didn't even blink an eye. I don't doubt that Brian found out more about their travels, but this happened during a time when he was still fresh to the idea of The Doctor and space/time travel.

And in Power of Three Amy mentions that it hasn't been 10 years for The Doctor, but specifically ten years for her and Rory. And she specifically states that she's spent ten years while going on on again, off again, adventures. ""Ten years older. Ten years of you, on and off."" It's not said as someone saying she's aged ten years while in the TARDIS, but she's simply lived ten years while having adventures in between.

And yes aging was a concern, but it's also obvious in the episode that The Doctor tries to send them back relative to their time spent travelling with him. It's mentioned several times that they go missing for months on end, and they themselves say they don't like committing because it's hard to keep to a strict schedule when they do indeed 'go missing' for a few months.

All in all, as well, there's given a very long sense of time in the episode. That they have been doing this for several years. From commenting about how The Doctor takes longer and longer to show up, they go missing for months at a time, it's been 10 months since Amy last saw The Doctor, but this all takes place only a year after lake Silencio?

I really don't think it makes sense at all to believe it's only 2012 for them, yet everything has been said to the contrary.

These are probably conservative estimates, but would still consign approximately a third of all British children (under 16 years of age) to below the official poverty line.
Even in their raw statistical form, the main survey findings paint an appalling picture of the daily conditions of life of many children and their families. Fully 80 percent of parents have had to borrow money to pay for essentials, such as food and clothes, in the past year, and 61 percent of parents in poverty say they have had to cut back on food. Twenty six percent say they have missed meals in the past year so their children can eat

At a time when we have so much conflict between the western world and muslim countries, it is pretty important to make people feel welcome here.

As someone who has been an atheist for as long as I've known what one is, and a significant proportion of my friends are atheist I can tell you that this isn't true. Not even remotely. If your opinion is based on what you've seen on the Internet or from people like Dawkins you are missing the true genuine apathy that large swathes of the population have. 

Agnostics I've met tend to be more ""open minded"", not in the scientific sense where you allow more than one opinion regarding speculative debate about the unknown, but in the ""this crystal *could* have magical powers"" sense.  

Atheism is not about categorically saying ""X does not exist.""; this isn't a useful mode of thinking. You look at the world from the other point of view; *convince me X is true* otherwise our default assumption is that its not true (or, rather, conforms to the null hypothesis of ""we can't know""). The burden of proof never rests upon the skeptic, always the believer.

Not all opinions are equally valid, if I want to convince you of something my opinion means nothing. My evidence is how I convince you of something; if you don't have evidence your opinion is completely worthless to anyone that doesn't already share it.

There is no convincing argument for why religion is true because it is an argument based on an unknown, undefinable concept. Any argument I have ever had about it has been incredibly tedious and, frankly, a waste of  time.

First off: P**a**edo. Secondly it would be dangerous because a public list would be accessible to people such as yourself.

The UK has one of the best systems in Europe, when it comes to managing sex offenders in the community. Via MAPPA [Multi Agency Public Protection Arangements] they're monitored in the community by a different agencies, depending on the assessed risk factor - it'll usually be local police and probation / local council or more, depending on their MAPPA Level.

Part of their conditions necessitate them signing the sex offender register on a yearly basis; informing police of any residence other than their own that they'll be staying overnight, any other residence they'll visit more than three times a year, and being subject to regular - unannounced, police visits.

If they fail to adhere to these conditions? They can rapidly be put back into prison.

Now imagine all that, in addition to the SOR[s] being publicly accessible. Anyone being able to punch in their post code, and finding the address of the nearest ""nonce""?

The [mass uninformed] public will view it as a good step forward for public protection. Those who work with these individuals [I know someone who knows someone who does.], however, recognise the immediate danger:

*Offenders will simply register, leave it a bit, and the move*. **Without notifying the authorities**

The song is good and catchy, *but* isn't as good as I thought an Adele bond theme would be. 

I wish the chorus had more impact, it sounds like she never really got her full voice behind it. Which I know is partly to do with the tone of the song, but to be a truly great bond song I think it needs soaring vocal impact. What makes Goldfinger and Diamonds Are Forever so good is that they go (excuse my singing):

""GolddddddFINGERRRRRRRRR-MY-VOICE-HAS-IMPACT""

and

""I don't neeeEEEEED LOOOVVVVVVVVEEEE-BECAUSE-MY-VOICE-IS-AMAZING""

Where as this song goes, ""Let the skyfallllll-as-my-voice-drains-to-nothing""

I wish the vocal sound was a bit more Rolling In The Deep and Set Fire To The Rain style. Still brooding and moody, but with impact. Then it would have been a classic Bond theme. 

Nevertheless, still a good song!

The family moved to the UK (Birmingham) in 2005, and the mother/child moved to Westminster in Sept 2009 following allegations of domestic abuse.

The death occurred in March 2010 and appears to have been an act of starvation by the mother who also failed to report the death for a number of days. The presence of food in the flat and in the bedroom suggests that it was available to the family.

In fact it seems that the mother suffered a medical breakdown and was unable to care for the baby.

To quote from the report: ""EG died in consequence of his mother ceasing to provide him with fluids and food and that his death was thus a consequence of a socially isolated parent suddenly developing an acute, rare and ultimately fatal cerebral condition rendering her incapable of continuing to provide otherwise adequate care""

The report notes that Westminster Council offered significant levels of support, but were hampered by combination of poor records being transferred from other agencies and the family itself being reluctant to cooperate.

While there are serious shortcomings in how various agencies worked (or failed to work) together - there is nothing in the report to suggest delays in benefit payments or a lack of food were in any way a contributory factor to the death.

This is a sad case caused by all to regular problems with multiple agencies not sharing information adequately - but to twist the story to feed a political agenda as the news article and the editorialised headline have tried to do is frankly, rather disgusting.",0,1349438289,null,0,false,0,c6hzbkr,t3_10zk8y,t1_c6hzbkr,t3_10zk8y,null,1430070082,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

104 is a good section, you will be near the half way line, on the ground level. You are also sitting on the side of the stadium directly opposite the TV cameras, so if you wear something funny / obvious, then there are chances that you will be seen on TV!

A lot of fans also drink beer in the city centre before the game, there are always Match day public Buses available from Manchester Piccadilly Gardens. They charge you £1.50 but then you get on the bus and it stops right outside the ground. There are also plenty of Taxis available from the City centre, they will cost about £6 if you dont fancy walking or getting the bus.

Me and My friends often go to a pub called the Mitchels Arms, this is on the way from Manchester Centre to the ground, if you walk it (15 minute walk), and i find it a lot easier to get into this Pub than to get in the world Famous Mary D's. If you arrive *at least an hour and a half* before kick off then you will get into Mary Ds. Any later than that and you may have to queue up for a long time and still might not get in!

Mary D's is an enormous Pub packed full of City fans, they will sing songs and help you learn the words, if you need to. The Mitchel's Arms is a much smaller pub, but there will still be singing!

We do not do 'tailgaiting' in England, as we are British and so we are far too insular and reserved for all that riotous shenanigans!! 

In all seriousness, the area around the ground is an alcohol controlled area and you are not actually allowed to drink beer on the streets or in public unless you are at a pub or bar with a designated outside drinking area! I kid you not! :(

PS Do try and drink before the match as getting beer at half time is almost impossible and even if you are successful it will prove to be a frustrating time, the bar service inside the ground is dreadful! I really should complain about it but then I am English and complaining is a foreign language to us :)

A ""human right"" is a ""inalienable fundamental rights to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being.""    

These are things like:    
 
 - Right to life   
 - Right to a fair trial    
 - Freedom of speech    
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion    

Now last I checked humans were born naked. So appearing literally as we are born really cannot get any closer to someone's rights.   

The law as it stands essentially is: ""unless you buy this item from this private company, and then wear it, you literally cannot leave your house or you will be arrested.""    

People have no right to never be offended by things. In fact freedom of speech almost guarantees that some things that you hear you won't like.   

I hear a lot of things which offend me, like racists, homophobes, and even some fundamentalist religious people. But I don't feel that infringes my ""rights"" or that I have the ""right"" to tell them to be quiet.    

If I don't want to hear them I can move away from them or simply ignore them.     

PS - There are limitations to ""freedom of speech"" like shouting fire in a crowded theatre or following people down the street who you ""hate"" and shouting abuse at them.

Towards the end of that phase though you had a lot more varied comments and insights. Now, there's not really a lot to say unless you discuss what picks/bans are coming and why, but there's other fluff you can talk about, previous meeting of the teams, who's likely to play what, some stats, basically some background information. Of course, this is difficult with a random ""pub"" game so you might want to think about skipping it. But the idea is to try and always be saying something. It's a lot easier with a partner because you can talk back and forth and also you can think while the other is talking.

I then skipped around the video a bit but my general feedback is you need to talk more, there's a lot of gaps in commentary. I'd also say you need to explain why quicker. You frequently go ""they're doing this"" wait, wait, wait, ""because this"". 2 Examples I found is dire pushing top tier 1 and riki 3 person smoke ~ 40 min youtube time.

Personal thing but I'd like a little more excitement. I like the soothing voice in general, but then there's a great play and you sound like your straining to be excited but keeping calm. e.g. 3 Person Black hole at ~42 min  youtube time. I don't want tobi ""BLACK HOOOOOOOOOOLE"" but like ""he's got 3 in a blackhole!"".

It depends - do you consciously consider each and every building and area you walk past every time you walk anywhere?  I don't - I couldn't, because there are too many of them and I just don't have the required memory or spare attention.

He wasn't *wanking in public* - he just walked past a playground.  On what basis do you assert he was ""clearly provoking matters"", as opposed to walking down a road to get somewhere that happened to go past a kids play area?

His whole point is that nudity is not inherently sexual, and it's wrong to make it so, and it's entirely possible he's trying to live his life normally aside from his nudism.  If he was only a nudist where everyone was happy for him to be naked (at home, in private, where nobody could see him), he wouldn't be much of an activist, would he?

If he's climbing over playground fences to chase kids or actively waving his cock at people in the street you'd have a point, but the point at which you *automatically assume* ""walking down a street that happens to have a playground in it"" is intentional provocation is the point at which his case has arguably been proved.

Sure, if he walked past a playground it's possible that someone might get offended and report him, and it's possible that he'd therefore be arrested.

Various quotes from [the founding document of the Fourth International](http://marx.org/history/etol/document/1930s/four.htm):

&gt; A proletarian party that evades the seizure of power under the present historic conditions commits the worst of betrayals.

To remain equal to its task, the new International must not permit any deviation from revolutionary principles in the questions of insurrection, proletarian dictatorship, soviet form of the state, etc.**

 **Swansea City --&gt; Parma**. Decided not to go back to Chelsea, once again, not much opportunity. Went back to his native Italy where he would get more first team action.

**Parma --&gt; Roma**. Immediately loaned out to Roma and purchased by them 6 months later. Replaced their best injured striker scoring 9 goals in 24 appearances.

**Roma --&gt; Liverpool**.  Brought in to be a central striker but should be playing back-up in our team. If we had one more striker he wouldn't be starting but would be a future prospect that comes in late as a sub.

This has all occurred between 2009 (when he joined Chelsea's reserves) to this year.

If he were an established striker in his middle or late 20's I would be much more worried about him going between all these clubs but he knows that he will only grow by getting some first team action, which is what he has been looking for.

I have realized that Liverpool supporters in this ""community"" are always going to the extremes.

Let me bring some sober thought.

1- We all want to finish top 4, but the reality of the club is different. We have not invested top 4 money on players, and the money we invested before has not given results yet.

2-The team is either very young, or very... ""seasoned."" The more veteran players will start to lose their pace and edge for the game, it happens to everyone. The younger ones are still learning, the good thing is that we all can see the progress. High expectations should be had for the future, not really right now.

3- New coach, new system. All I can say to that is, Rome was not built in one day. Neither was modern barcelona for that matter. Although, I am very excited to see us play the way we are playing :D

4- We are asking kids in their early 20's to not only adapt to the toughest, most competitive league in the world, with a new coach and a new system, but we are asking them to be clinical and ""world class""

Lets try to relax a bit, we will have to wait to taste glory again. But I am convinced that under the new management, the glory will come again. If in 2 or 3 years we still dont have anything to show for, then the club should evaluate their vision.

It should also be noted that certain sections of our electricity grid in the UK is operating at above 100% capacity (i.e. substations).  The problem we here in the UK are facing is not simply a lack of generating capacity it's a complete lack of updated infrastructure to support growing demands from power stations down.

I invited all of my friends and people who were not yet my friends to Who night so we could all watch it together. We just finished Journey's End and are watching The Other Doctor and all the Tennant Specials/movies in a marathon on the 13th, then jumping into the Smith Era. 

I have made friends at work with people who I never thought would share a common interest with me because of Doctor Who. 

Last night at Doctor Who night my 3yr old Goddaughter was there, she has been at every DW/night since the beginning in May. She sometimes watches but we don't expect her to react or remember anything. So I was shocked when she sat and watched the last 2 episodes with us. She barely moved and every time you heard ""EXTERMINATE!"" she would shout ""DALEKS!!!"" and clap her hands and watch them destroy everything. She asked who Davros was, asked why Rose was crying and snuggled with us while we cried at the end. 

My relationship with my Whovian Goddaughter is going to be AMAZING when she gets older and wants to rewatch them all. I am super excited to see her reaction to 11. She is also creeped out by the Weeping Angels.

1) Live in self-catered, shared bathroom halls in Year 1. They're the cheapest by a mile. After that, move out into a nearby area. Where I live is rough, but fuck me is it cheap.

2) Learn to cook ASAP. Stir Frys, pots of beans, chilli .etc. Stuff thats cheap and lasts a long time

3) Make a spreadsheet. You get given certain amounts at certain times. Know when this is and budget around it, giving yourself a certain amount a week for each thing i.e Rent, Food, Social stuff

4) Buy cheap but good. Difference between Smart Price Chicken and Finest chicken? Sure there is, but you probably don't care. Aldi and Lidl are both goldmines for this, the amount of people I see at Fallowfield Sainsburys (The most expensive in England) when down the road is a Lidl or a shitload of Markets selling virtually the same stuff just without the branding.

5) Make lunches. If your lectures are a trek from your halls, Greggs can make a mint out of you on lunch. Go ASDA about half 8 at night and you can buy bread for about 15p, some cheap ham/cheese and make your lunch for the week.

6) Buy a bike. This one might be a bit Manc specific but a buspass for the year is £200. Sound like your doing a masters so thats 4 years. £800 or a decent £330 bike and some locks (some buildings have sheds too) make it a no brainer.

The Welsh language is still VERY much alive, *especially* in North and Mid Wales. It aint dying out any time soon, regardless of what people say. There are plenty of courses out there and people trying to bring the language back full scale.

As for Wales itself - that wont be forgotten anytime soon. Ever started a conversation with an American about Wales and the castles and the hillsides and whatnot? They go crazy go for it!

&gt;1.5 At this juncture, there is no dispute on his part that Mr. Terry used the following words (although Mr. Ferdinand claims not to have heard them at the time):
&gt; ""fuck off, fuck off, ... fucking black cunt, fucking knob-head.""
&gt;There is also no doubt that Mr. Terry said something after ""fuck off, fuck off”,"" but before ""fucking black cunt, fucking knob-head."" The available film footage of the incident, which was taken from different camera locations, shows another Chelsea player - John Obi Mikel from one angle, and Ashley Cole from another - briefly obscuring Mr. Terry‟s face as he uttered the missing word or words. There is a dispute as to what they were. The significance of this will be discussed in due course.

And:

&gt;6.3 The Chief Magistrate made this observation of Mr. Terry‟s defence: 
 &gt;“Mr. Terry‟s explanation is, certainly under the cold light of forensic examination, unlikely. It is not the most obvious response. It is sandwiched between other undoubted insults.”  

And:

&gt;6.5.1 [...] it was “highly unlikely” that Mr. Ferdinand accused Mr. Terry on the pitch of calling him a “black cunt” (p.14 of the judgment, emphasis added). This finding represents an implicit rejection of Mr. Terry‟s case in this regard.    

And:

&gt;7.3 [...] Mr. Ferdinand's unchallenged evidence before the Commission is that he did not use any word beginning with a „b‟ that might have been heard and/or misunderstood by Mr. Terry to be „black‟ or any other kind of racial reference that could possibly have led the latter to believe that an accusation of a racial slur had been made against him.

7.27-7.42 covers the ""evolution"" of Cole's testimony, but it is too much to quote.

Missing children are given high prominence in news media because finding a missing child often depends on a random member of the public recognising them, hence their image is drummed in to the public consciousness. It's a standard police tactic and it's used because it often works. Usually children are found within a few hours of their disappearance making local news. 

If this happened to your family would you want the media to ignore it?! 

April Jones is not a celebrity, she's a five year who's missing. There are thousands of people who volunteered to look for her and yet here you are moaning that the world gives a shit about a missing child.

Why would an atheist society not like being put next to the Muslims? Are you under the (mistaken) impression that atheist societies exist so atheists can sit around slagging off gods they don't believe in and people who believe in those gods?

I'm not arguing it's ""free speech"" in a ""haha suck it up Muslims!"" type way, as I made it clear in another comment. I trust you read a tiny little bit of the link I gave you? That should make it clear as to where I'm coming from - this issue isn't about ""having the freedom to piss off minority religions"", but rather the growing problems people face with criticising Islam (because of a very small minority of Muslims who don't like it - most are perfectly fine and reasonable people, just like everyone else).

""The sole reason"" they did this, or why they claimed to have done it, is at odds with your assertion - it even says so in OP's article. Apart from the fact that you were in the vicinity, why should we believe you over them particularly given the recent incident I described earlier?

true,thecritic06,cnty-wales,Aberystwyth Yorkshireman,"Boss: Okay team. You're some of the best minds we have here at First Great Western. We need to seriously brainstorm how to combat increasing dissatisfaction with rail travel. We're really beginning to feel the pinch, having only made £200m profit last year. So, have at it. Let's throw some ideas at the wall and see what sticks. Really think outside the box, yeah?

Steve: I guess, erm... I mean... People don't really like travelling by train any more, because, maybe, erm. Maybe it's not exciting enough.

Boss: Gold, Steve, keep going.

Steve: Well perhaps, you know, it should be more like films.

Boss: Yeah, I'm really interested to see where you're going with this.

Steve: Oh, well, that's really pretty much all I was going to say.

Boss: Riiight. Okay, well, thanks for that contribution. We'll put that on the back boiler for now, I think. Anyone else? Come on gang!

Susan: I think, yeah, maybe Steve's right. In films rail travel is all exciting and glamorous, with people with shiny brass button shouting 'all aboard' and waving flags and stuff. And, I mean, I guess we don't have that stuff any more. I think, maybe, we should maybe look at bringing some stuff like that back. Like, maybe watch some films with trains and see what people do that makes it fun.

Boss: Yeah, yeah, this is great stuff. Inject the passion back into travelling on the railway, I love it. Just one minor hangup, really, is that we can't threaten the bottom line. I mean, I love what you're saying, yeah? But that stuff is going to cost money. And I mean, when we're trying to be as... financially efficient as possible, I think maybe we need to look at strategies which approach the problem from the angle you've mentioned, without incurring extra costs, saving money even.

Susan: So that means...

Boss: Yeah, I mean, extra staff or new uniforms or flags are pretty much right out at the moment. So that's a setback, but I still think we can develop this approach into something that really makes train travel exciting and that something customers, and our marketing team, can really be excited about.

Steve: Well I mean, I guess in films people usually, erm...

Boss: Go on.

Steve: Well they don't often have automatic doors.

Boss: Yeah, yeah, this is something we can really work with. Anyone?

Sandra: I watched Murder on the Orient Express the other day, or maybe a documentary about the Orient Express with David Suchet or something, but I noticed that they don't have automatic doors. People have to open them manually by sticking their arm out the window.

Boss: This sounds fantastic. And I mean, there are so many angles we could take this for marketing. First Great Western; Just like the Orient Express! Although maybe the legal department would... Well, anyway, there's the environmental angle too. Our manual doors save enough electricity per year to incubate a thousand premature newborns, or something. I can picture it already. And people having to reach out and open the handle, that might make the whole thing more memorable, make the whole experience just scream 'classic', yeah? This is fantastic work, great work everyone. I'll pull some strings and see if maybe you can each get a few grand as a bonus. Just don't count on that cause really it will depend on what the higher-ups say. Well, at any rate, you've definitely earned a coffee break.

true,pbhj,uk,.,"Currently I've got two ideas based on the circumstances and my own prejudice that might placate you a little, and it's your lucky day I'm going to share them with you:

1. The suspect who's been arrested ran the girl over and disposed of the body in a panic.

2. The current suspect is completely innocent and only happened to be the last person to see her alive.

From how the police have acted it seems they don't have much to go on, particularly the repeated calls for anyone who saw Mark Bridger to come forward. This *suggests* to me that he's claiming innocence and they need to prove he's lying.

From the parents evening at 17h00 ([map and timeline here](http://www.channel4.com/news/april-jones-abduction-timeline the map here is very clear)), he allegedly takes April around 19h00 (to 19h30) in his Land Rover. Now, he doesn't flee. He's spotted at [09h15](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9588326/April-Jones-Mark-Bridger-was-at-school-parents-evening.html) in his car, he puts the Land Rover in to a garage in town some time before he gets picked up by police, despite knowing there's a search on he's spotted at the river bank at [13h45](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9588326/April-Jones-Mark-Bridger-was-at-school-parents-evening.html)-[14h30](http://www.channel4.com/news/april-jones-missing-girl-sighting-river-bank-man) and arrested at 15h30. He apparently asked after April with one of the searchers.

Not that these things are supposed to make sense but it seems very strange that he would hang around the town, put his car in the garage, if he'd abducted the girl?

&gt;*Witnesses have described seeing Mr Bridger driving “erratically” through the estate where April lived an hour before she was abducted.* //

Doesn't seem to fit in with anything except perhaps he was drunk, but then he was just at the Parents Evening and they'd have spotted if he was drunk enough to drive badly I feel.

Anyone any thoughts on motive given that this man's family, including his young daughters apparently live local to the Jones'.

It seems that it can't have been premeditated unless April's family were in the habit of having her playing out after dark alone (she was staying up as a treat apparently)? Bridger would know that his vehicle would be recognised too. If it was a spur-of-the-moment thing then what happened: he's driving home from a parents evening and suddenly decides he'll stop and abduct a girl? Sounds like there's probably a large part of this we know nothing about, perhaps a family element?

I guess I'm trying to make sense where there probably isn't any ... it's all very sad.",0,1349468684,null,0,1349469194,0,c6i6kja,t3_10zih1,t1_c6i6kja,t1_c6i0adm,null,1430073630,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Knowing it now, and if we had known it then, things would have been handled very differently.

If you want to go on a journey with bikes, then you could go on the excellent bike tracks around Penmachno, not too far away from Betws. Just be careful if you do that, some people don't get emergency reception which isn't nice if you fall off and break something precious. And after riding around for a while, you can go to see the Conwy Falls(again, careful along the exposed paths) and have a bite to eat at the Conwy Falls Café. They usually have a movie screening on Saturdays too, so you could do the old stereotypical American car-movie-viewing thing.

In Betws itself, you could go walk some of the footpaths across the bridge from a fish and chip shop(don't go in there, food poisoning isn't romantic), which are lovely.

The British version of Fraggle Rock was made by old ITV station TVS. When they lost their franchise at the end of 1992 it was sold to an American company which then changed hands a few times and what is left is now a very small, neglected part of Walt Disney.

Their programme library did survive and is stored somewhere in Kent. Some programmes like Art Attack and Ruth Rendell were sold to independent production companies, however at some point along the line the paperwork for the rest of the archive was lost. This means that even if Disney had any interest in the archive they can't license any of it for sale.

Hmm you take umbrage pretty quickly. I'm going to go with an element of projection on your part. Are you under the impression I've been berating you? Tone is hard to convey, of course, but I assure you I've not been grouchy. Not even now - I'm having fun.

However, on the ""Omg why r u replying to me with so much words?!"" front: I'm replying to something you said - which in itself was a reply to something someone else said - on an open forum where people are known to discuss things.

This should not be surprising to you and if you're not having a giggle (I don't see how it could be funny but then again you're a very bored redditor) then I don't see how you've come this far without noticing that people have conversations around here.

&gt; As a Christian I hate the fact that they decided to rename it Jesus

Aha, got it. I begin to see the light on the issue you have with this incident.

&gt; I should point out as you will probably attempt to, that I don't dislike atheists

Nope I don't have to make such comments about what your opinions might be. You, however, decided that all the atheists there hated being near the Muslims. Do you think that's fair? Going by the information I have... I don't. And you've not presented anything more.

You seem to be pigeon holing their actions while unaware of why they might have done it - You didn't know about the LSE incident, like I said in my first comment. 

I get the impression you've labelled them ""Dawkins wannabes"" in your mind and dismissing them because of that. Have you ever talked to them? I think you should as it might dispell your notion that they'd hate being near Muslims. Do you realise how insulting that actually is?

&gt; you make your own choices and leave me to mine etc etc

Oh dear fecking Jeebus on a bicycle with Mohammed in the basket like ET: No: not if you present them to the world!

You seem to be unhappy that I replied to you... Why even bother replying? If you don't like it, leave, but remember I replied to you because your opinion was, so far as I knew, incorrect in some way.

If you're fine being all bewildered that someone might want to perhaps give you some new information, or a different perspective, then have fun with that.

&gt; if I respect your beliefs I believe you should have the common curtsy to respect mine

A common appallingly bad conclusion, often made by religious people but not always. Let me make it clear: disrespecting someone's beliefs is not the same as disrespecting the person. Do you respect the beliefs of a man who thinks it is his divine right to beat his wife? Or is that somehow different and not what you meant... ?

I can only advise going and speaking to the atheist soc about that opinion. Don't assume they'll laugh in your face; they'll probably give you a new perspective. I'm serious - you really should. That's the way we learn about each other, by discussing and not assuming things. You might notice the atheist soc were advertising a discussion.

&gt; that just reeks of lack of respect because of how pointless and immature it was.

Kinda like how you've labelled all the atheists that were there ""pricks."" and that, apparently, before you mentioned they renamed the pineapple Jesus. Does that include all the people who signed up?

You're linking to an article talking about the SJA episode that mentions a 507 regeneration limit, which has tons of issues in and of itself.

It's just a show that happens to have the same characters, but isn't within the same universe. Furthermore, if you watch the episode it's obvious that The Doctor is being facetious, not serious. He's being asked questions at an inappropriate time, and he's just spouting out answers. Finally, RTD has come out since and said that he only put that line in to see how fans would react to it, and not seriously trying to change canon.

It hasn't been nixed. It just hasn't been gotten around to yet because The Doctor still has two more regenerations. People need to be patient, the time will come when it gets brought up, and we'll have some story or story arch in which The Doctor finds a way to circumvent the limit. I assure you.

I get the impression you've labelled them ""Dawkins wannabes"" in your mind and dismissing them because of that. Have you ever talked to them? I think you should as it might dispell your notion that they'd hate being near Muslims. Do you realise how insulting that actually is?

once again attempting to put words in my mouth ""Dawkins Wannabes"" seriously? Honestly, dear god you just seem to see all this stuff when it's not there. How you can get all this from my lets be honest vague and small answers. 

""I can only advise going and speaking to the atheist soc about that opinion. Don't assume they'll laugh in your face; they'll probably give you a new perspective. I'm serious - you really should.

true,galenwolf,eng-manchester,Manchester - FOR SCIENCE!,"As someone else has already said France has Nuclear power plants on its north coast, a coast that is so close we can have a train tunnel connecting to it.

We are already in danger, what happend in Japan was due to their location and the fact it was an event of unexpected power.

Chernobyl was entirely due to fucking around with the reactor. They did an experiment to increase water flow in case of a SCRAM which went so wrong it ended up blowing up the reactor. A TLDR: When a SCRAM happens back up generators fire up to keep the water cooling the reactor moving, the problem is it takes time which could cause core damage. To solve this they wanted to use the steam turbines to fill the gap as they wound down.  On the 4th experiment they used an unstable, and extremely dangerous, configuration which caused a positive feedback loop due to the turbine not producing enough power. That was made worse when someone (or thing) set off an actual SCRAM, which due to the control rod design caused  water cooling the core to be displaced which caused a massive power spike. This resulted causing an explosion which damaged the control rods and the reactor which resulted in an even bigger power spike (30GW).  Water got into the inner reactor which then flash steamed which blew off the  2,000-ton upper plate. This resulted in a second massive explosion when the core went critical.

TLDR TDLR: The core didn't blow due to normal useage but a failed experiment.

Personally I found her the best companion by quite some length, her and her 'people' (Mickey was a bit useless, but likeable. Jackie is fantastic).

Donna was charismatic and tough, but again it did the Doctor little good. I just think Rose had a brilliant dynamic with the Doctor, and she wasn't a Mary-Sue by any stretch of the imagination

I found Martha ridiculously bland to be honest, I can't even imagine her appeal. She's not annoying or anything but she just has very little to make me like her, except her intelligence. 

Donna was absolutely stellar though, and I really disliked her in The Runaway Bride! She had such a personality and I can understand people who both love and hate her, as she actually has a personality.

Amy was pretty great too, but I find her a little overrated. She is a bit *too* good, which I fear may be the problem with the next companion. Though Rory was brilliant, I can't help but love that guy.

No, no we shouldn't.  Two separate trials, with vastly different circumstances.

true,hhbenaf,null,null,"I'm watching through the reboot and I've made it to season 6, but I still miss Rose.  It is true that other great companions come along, but here's how I see it: in season 1, the main characters are obviously the Doctor and Rose, but we honestly know a lot more about Rose.  The first episode is told from her perspective, we get to know her parents and boyfriend, and she is essentially our window into the Doctor's world.  She's relateable.

On top of all that, the 9th Doctor basically dies at the end of season 1 - one of the main characters of the show is gone.  Luckily, Rose is still around to help us get used to the 10th doctor (especially important because for a lot of us that's the first regeneration we see).  Throughout season 2 I got used to the 10th doctor and start to love him, but it felt like Rose was the ""veteran"" of the show.  From my perspective at least, she's been there since the beginning of the show and the 10th doctor hasn't.

Then, during the season 2 finale, Rose and the Doctor are separated.  You know Rose is still alive, but the show is going to follow the Doctor's story because at the end of the day the show is about him.  And so the show loses the first character that I cared about.

2) This is not some isolated uprising, it's the culmination of roughly 60 years of separate uprisings since the 1890's - such a thing is hardly a surprise and could have been averted if only the British had been less heavy-handed with its Kenyan rule.

3) British rule was marked not only by neglect but also purposeful economic deprivation of the Kenyans, including tax burdens that were even heavier than European ones. British rule was a cruel rule, pretty much undoubtedly. 

4) Part of the military operation that swept through Nairobi to kill off the uprising at its brain stem as it were involved taking any and every Kenyan in their path to camps and keeping members of certain tribes for 'screening', regardless of whether there was any trial or not, and regardless of whether it was possible for them to actually be members of the uprising (like say, old women and children...) But still this was quickly filtered down to loyalist Mau Maus, especially afte sweepign through forests and stuff

5) **The detention camps**, which were initially about rehabilitation, a sort of lofty social reform, became basically British gulags. Little food or water, barely *any* sanitation. This is after the worst of the uprising... Talking was forbidden in the camps. They were overcrowded and understaffed. Diseases spread incredibly quickly. Not to mention the recent allegations of torture. The camps were a huge organisation, it is impossible to deny this. 

And the worst part is that it all showed how much the British had failed, and how they eventually had to give in and make nearly all the concessions that had been demanded of them before.

How easily the violence and bloodshed of the actual uprising coud have been avoided if we British had any capacity to actually run our little empire instead of taking the spoils at the expense of increasingly angry natives.

I really, really believe that we won't get bullied and lose out on work rate with Warnock at the helm; both of which always happened against Barnsley while Grayson was in charge. We never previously matched them for sheer grit and determination, leaving us both outmuscled and outplayed. With Tonge, Austin, Brown and Byram expected to play in midfield, we shouldn't get rolled over. I think that we also had trouble getting motivated to play against the Tykes, while they always saw it as a proverbial cup final. Hopefully we shouldn't have that problem with Warnock.

However, we will still concede goals. That's a guarantee. With that in mind, I'll go for **2-1** to Leeds.

Warnock has developed a bit of a habit of changing at least one player in his team lately, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I expect him to stick with Tuesday's line-up. Here it is:

---------------Kenny

Peltier---Lees---Pearce---Drury

Byram---Brown---Austin---Tonge

---------------Diouf

---------------Becchio

The accusation is the risk modelling was wrong. Not that they were in charge nor that the financial part of the bid was poorly done. 

It's a fascinating story.

An ex banker misjudging risk. Not that improbable is it?

Senior civil servants suspended days after the scandal breaks. At this level you have to have some hard dirt to do that without holding a 6 month inquiry.

Alternatively they are taking the heat unfairly covering up for some serious corruption and they'll be reinstated next year when the fuss has died down.  

It's going to be interesting watching the story unfold. Right now I don't have sympathy for any of the main players.

Their lives leading up to their deaths are fixed.  In current 2012 timeline, everything that has happened in the Ponds' lives is now in the past and cannot be changed. 

*The events in the book are definite to only Future River.
It isn't that because someone read something out of a book that it must happen. It's that in the future, River writes this book as a factual account of the events that transpired.  At the time she writes it, the events have passed. To read ahead in the book is to solidify the events into this timeline as they have already happened to future River. To not read ahead is to keep your current actions in a gray area, like schodinger's cat. You have all of the possibilities in front of you and whatever you choose, future River will write about it.  To read ahead, you defining the one choice that future River has already written about in the future. 

*The easiest way to define a paradox:  You cannot hold in your hand evidence from an aborted timeline.  
That item, whatever it is, cannot exist concurrently with the timeline that is replacing it. If that happens, a paradox occurs in the universe and the universe fixes it by undoing whatever caused it. Marty McFly can't hold a picture of his family if his mom marries Biff.  Modern earth inhabitants can't be annihilated by their descendants that they then won't ever create.  You can't be looking at two dead Rorys in the same place and time.  So if you are holding a book from the future that says you break your wrist, and then do not break your wrist, the timeline in which that happened has now been aborted. That is a dissidence between the Future River that didn't break her wrist and the Future River that did.  Those are two timelines that can't exist in the same place.

*The gravestone is River's book. 
All the events that happened to cause that gravestone to occur are now set in place. To do anything those events, to change them in anyway, that would be a paradox that would destroy the world.

true,globaldu,eng-sussex,Sussex,"I was staying away overnight on a job and eating alone in a small curry house in Stevenage.

So long as the receipt just says ""food and drink"" and isn't itemised, we can get quite pissed and claim it back on expenses, so I was still pondering over the poppadoms while on my 3rd or 4th pint.

It was a weekday evening and the place wasn't busy, so I didn't feel I needed to rush to make room for other customers.

I told the waiter that I'd like him to suggest a dish for me. I didn't care what it was or how hot. He said that his favourite was Methi Chicken, which wasn't on the menu but he would ask the chef if he wouldn't mind preparing it for me.

After a couple more beers it arrived, and was pretty good. As is normal, especially when it's not busy, the waiter came back and asked me if everything was all right.

I replied that it was very good, thanked him and had a brief chat lasting no more than a minute or two about the origin of the dish and shit like that.
Now I was quite pissed by this point, but I was alone and tired. I might've been a little chatty but I was being polite, friendly and certainly not loud enough to bother any of the other (few) customers.

Suddenly his boss arrived out of nowhere and started **shouting** at him to stop bothering me, get back to work, there's tables to be cleared, etc.

I sat in disbelief for a few seconds as the poor fellow scurried off, before standing up and giving the guy a very loud bollocking about how he's ruined my meal and that it's totally unacceptable to behave like that on the restaurant floor. I asked if he was the manager and he told me he was, so there wasn't much else I could do but ask for the bill and leave. 

He apologised and offered to comp my meal, which I refused (I wasn't paying for it, and the meal was good) but demanded I settle the bill now, with him, not the waiter. 

As I left I bunged the waiter a tenner and told him it was intended solely for him, not the house.

I've been in restaurants where I've heard shouting in the kitchen - that's pretty normal - but never have I had my meal - and conversation - interrupted by a mardy boss shouting at my server in front of me, especially given the place was 3/4 empty.

I mean, even if a big party had just arrived (they hadn't or my waiter would have noticed, apologised, and left me to seat them), the manager was doing fuck all - he could've greeted them.

Off topic somewhat - apologies for that - but it just reminded me of one of the only times I've asked for something off menu.

Our form is good, even though we have a multitude of injuries, and the team hasn't quite moved into a higher gear yet. The daring, never say die, will return, and even more quickly if this form continues.

I'm personally excited by the winning mentality that I can see slowly working it's way through the team.
