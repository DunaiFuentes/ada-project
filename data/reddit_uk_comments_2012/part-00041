It endangers all loopholes because it is a blanket code that sits over the numerous niches and sub codes in which they hide, and will legislate for abuse of the system.  It would be a terrible idea though to remove all leeway for businesses because that's exactly the incentive that drives new business set ups and entrepreneurs.  No incentive and they might as well remain protected and provided for by employment law.

The worst excesses is exactly Aaronson and Osborne agreed to, but GAAR will lay out when exactly somebody is taking the piss in regards to tax avoidance as opposed to tax evasion which is already illegal. Tax avoidance as of itself can be a good thing, it can even increase tax revenue as a whole, it is only when it is excessive that it becomes a problem.

Derry decision was a disgrace, according to Dermot Gallagher they didn't appeal the offside, just the foul itself. As they are treated separately, the FA feels he clearly fouled Young. Bollucks

Balotelli one is the most perplexing. If it was seen during the game, how did he escape punishment? Was the ref even made aware of it, I don't think it was in his report so he couldn't have been. Who is this official who sees these things and neglects to tell the ref, thereby removing the possibility of retrospective action?

I'd not really thought about the loss of Cook. Most to tend to overlook the role of the CEO given football clubs' unique operational structure. However, one of the reasons he was so good is because he was a brand man rather than a pure football man. By this, I mean he looked at the club objectively. He wasn't looking at the pitch as the be all and end all of success. He was trying to make the club No.1 worldwide and recognised that the football is one aspect of that strategy. Everything else has to be in place to pull it off.

To give a clearer analogy, it's no good having the best beer in the world if you can't bottle it and get it to consumers in a timely manner. If you're just focussed on brewing it you'll fuck the rest up and you'll have a shit-ton of lovely beer going to waste.

What we want is someone with that mentatlity and ability plus the football connections to sit at the top table comfortably. Easy...

I do have to take one exception though, being a bitter blue, Man U are looking ominously *effective,* not good. They've been awful at times. The Spurs game springs to mind. Absolutely shite until they were 3-0 up.

I thought what Alan Davies said was pretty insulting, he shouldn't have resorted to the personal attacks. I still feel that some of what he said made sense. Alan Davies receiving death threats though just reaffirms my long held opinion that fanatical football fans and hooligans really are the shame of our entire country - regardless of what club they support.

I mean, on November 11th we pause for 2 minutes to remember the millions that have died fighting for our country since 1914, we don't all refuse to go to work.

Americans don't refuse to work on September 11th, Rangers don't refuse to play on the anniversary of their stadium disaster they hold a few minutes silence before the match. Bradford play on the anniversary of their stadium fire. Manchester United don't refuse to play on the anniversary of the Munich Air Disaster. 

Why does Liverpool get such special treatment in this case? I can understand when they requested in 2009 to have a CL semi final rescheduled since it was the 20th anniversary, but every year? especially when it is affecting another club quite dramatically in this case.

I also wish the Heysel disaster was remembered more by Liverpool fans, whilst its clear the fans had nothing to do with the Hillsborough disaster, the same cannot be said about Heysel. As far as I am aware, Liverpool FC wouldn't refuse to play on the anniversary of Heysel.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"There actually is a ""version"" of a bachelor party that women have, a ""tradition"" they are extended *all the time*. It's not ""running away with another man on your wedding night while not telling your husband"" it's **a bachelorette party**. Which *Amy already had* (see: Let's Kill Hitler). I can't stress this enough. Amy **already had a bachelorette party**. That's the equivalent. No, that's the *exact* equivalent.

I don't know how you think that a party (one that isn't even necessarily a ""one last fling"" type scenario) is equal to fleeing from home without telling either parties the full story. They are *nothing alike*. You're turning it into some display of protest to the unfairness of the sexes, but I cannot stress enough that *the sexes were fair*. Amy had a bachelorette party, Rory had a bachelor party.

Running away with a guy you intend on boning *is totally not* the same as a bachelor party. Those two things are on *wildly* different scales. Let's just nip this thing in the bud right now. Men don't plan on having sex with another woman before the wedding. Amy got the Doctor thrown on her bed and planned on *fucking him*. So can we please stop acting like somehow the fact that men have  bachelor parties somehow justifies Amy abandoning her husband to run off with another bloke?

She spent at the very least a few weeks. We have her and the Doctor reference other places they've been that aren't adventures we see that would likely take around a day. But the point is that it was more than a day having a fling with your dream guy that you later try to ride. That's just the tiniest bit selfish.

There's a difference between compliance and respect. Compliance would be ""yes, let's go back home immediately"". Respect is going ""alright, let's have two more adventures and then we can go get married"" or doing even the tiniest thing to show that you understood how important this was to Rory. But all she did was say ""later"" and ""there's no rush"". That's not showing respect back while Rory *only* thinks of Amy's best interests. To not reciprocate that, even in a medium degree, shows a lack of respect.

She showed sexual interest in the Doctor *long* before Flesh and Stone. She doesn't look away while he changes in Eleventh Hour (another example of her ignoring Rory's feelings *again*) and flirts with him passingly on several occasions (see the whole ""Space Gandalf"" short). She even says she'd been waiting to make a move on him ""for a long time"".

But he obviously doesn't shut up about how much he loves her. In Vampires in Venice he leaves a message on her answering machine because he hasn't told her he loves her in seven hours. He tells her she's smashing and that even if it wasn't their wedding night he'd still ask her to marry him. That's *total love*, and moreover *total trust*. Something that Amy totally ignores and takes advantage of by deceiving him.

&gt; Yes, Amy's an adult. She doesn't ""consistently"" ignore the ""please of those who love her"" but rather the consistent plea of one person, Rory. The two of them have a fundamental disagreement about traveling with the Doctor. Constant refusal to agree with Rory doesn't compound her selfishness. 

How many people love her? Her Aunt's away all the time (possibly erased from existence), she has no parents, and her only friend is a destructive bad-girl who ends up being her daughter. No one is shown to love her *other than Rory*. And he loves her *intensely*. She wants to run away from the marriage, he doesn't. Instead of addressing this like an adult, she tries to just run away from it without telling him.

And the thing she doesn't want to agree with Rory on *is their marriage*, is their *life together*. She wants to go about the universe having fun with her imaginary friend with no responsibilities. *That is selfish*.

Again, she harbored a passion for the Doctor for ""a long time"", at least since she first showed it in Eleventh Hour, likely longer. She left without telling Rory and she didn't tell the Doctor she was even engaged. *That's* being deceitful to both parties.

She planned on running away and then coming back the next day with no ramifications. That's just childish and totally disrespectful to Rory's trust in her, let alone his unquestioned love.

&gt; Think about the speed of the scene. Amy snogs the Doctor and then **they** immediately rush off to tell Rory.

*Nope*. Amy didn't do a damn thing. In fact, she didn't seem too terribly pleased to have Rory onboard. The Doctor did that, he even states that it was his idea. The Doctor is also the person to say that Amy tried to bed him. Amy didn't fess up to that, the Doctor did. Again, it's the deceit, the hiding the truth that's what *really* bugs me.

How does Rory risking his life to save Amy from the Vampire seem ""unromantic"" to you, but Amy choosing to die *in a dream that she was relatively sure wasn't real* is somehow reconciliation for her bad behaviour *that she never apologized for*.

Amy *does* lie, if not just through omission and keeping those who care for her in the dark then through cruel manipulation. She may do this out of ""fear of commitment"" or other childish things but the bottom line is that that's just not a good excuse.

It's not ""I don't like Amy, so I don't like Amy's bahaviour."" It's ""I don't like Amy's bahaviour, so I don't like Amy"". Amy will abuse and take advantage of Rory's leniency and will deliberately do things she's aware he's not fond of.

To sum this whole thing up, I'd like to underscore my most important point:

In ""Blink"":

* Angel looks at Angel - they both become quantum locked and they're stuck. This is why they keep their eyes covered as much as possible.

In ""Flesh and Stone"" - 

* Amy is warned not to look into an Angel's eye. 

* The image of an Angel becomes an Angel.

* Amy looks into it's eye and she ends up almost spawning a Weeping Angel out of her head because of it (""retcon"", I think they call it).


SO: Following this logic, if a Weeping Angel gets stuck looking at the eyes of another Angel, they might both become quantum locked, but would they create new Angels from by capturing the image of each other, the same way that Amy did? 

If we assume this is accurate, then it's possible that we can call the act of a Weeping Angel covering it's eyes all the time *birth control*.


**tl;dr: Weeping Angels keep their eyes covered so they don't make baby Weeping Angels.**

&gt; MP posts are the only jobs where people who have no experience or qualifications for that job are awarded those positions, I can think of no other job where that would happen.

You're confusing the issue here. Most MPs have incredibly impressive CVs and overall bring a wide range of knowledge on the gamut of issues. They get to choose what debates to contribute to and what issues or questions to raise, so the issue of their expertise really is more anti-politician sentiment than reality.

If you're worried about ministers who lack direct expertise, then I'm sure you know the standard response: they are surrounded by all sorts of experts and advisers. Also the focus of the job tends to lead to an expertise of sorts. 

My response would be that a minister doesn't really benefit from industry experience or even a directly relevant degree. First because it opens them up to allegations of cronyism (a constant political headache). Secondly, it prejudices their opinion and responses to legislation making the entire process rather truculent. But most importantly, any minister worth their salt will have spent a long process getting to know the system in which they operate, how to get what they need from civil servants and learn the intricacies of (albeit junior) ministerial control. This can be achieved through a long term shad-cab position or through lower level positions and is far more relevant to the job than 10 years working in finance. 

Essentially what this boils down to is that it's ridiculous to describe ministers as being unqualified, as the only experience which is really necessary to govern is governing.

The flip side would be to have a technocratic gov. rather like in Italy and Greece whose performance should prove to be interesting.

Grant was arguably made the official 9th Doctor. There was also for some unknown reason an android version of the Master, IIRC possibly evil, as a companion (not the female companion) unable to leave the TARDIS.

Then the new series was announced and it was basically overturned and made unofficial. To get around this some fan speculation has argued this is in fact a younger version of the first doctor. 

It's worth a look on youtube, it isn't amazing and the animation is pretty poor but has its moments and  like the design for the Doctor and his mannerisms and REG as him (even if he isnt quite on top form) and the bits with the Master are all pretty excellent.

No one would fault him for leaving (I wouldn't at least) if we fail to make CL football after it all looked so certain. Nevermind the fact that management is unstable at the moment, and Harry will almost certainly be leaving.

(This treats Eleventh Hour as a two-parter, as it is extra long)

1. We see the Doctor having fun with introductions to Amy for a bit, then running into real trouble. Drama emerges surrounding Amy and we get insight into what the big story-arch is going to be for this season, probably through a mysterious phrase. Things like ""corner of your eye"" or ""could be anywhere"" are going to be brought up quite a bit referring to the baddie. But because the Doctor's just so clever he's tricked the baddie into screwing itself over *with just a phone*.

1. An episode that's pretty ho-hum, that tries to inject a moving and emotional theme amidst thick accents.

1. An important element of Doctor Who comes back up as the Doctor's forced to face an old friend/foe that he's always known taking on a new face.

1. Two parter! We see the Doctor and Company trapped and outnumbered by another foe, often with the Doctor and his companions becoming separated. Things get really dark, but in the end everyone's fine and the Doctor has a realization about Amy and what the overarching plot is.

1. Change in companions! The dynamic changes between the Doctor and his companions and the tone gets *pretty dark*, focusing on the Doctor and whether he's a good person for what he does.

1. A cocky antagonist is introduced to fuck up the Doctor and Co.'s day for no real reason. We see a main character effectively die or become dying and another realize how much they love them and effectively die themselves as a sacrifice to save their love (no one really dies, of course).

1. The Doctor's companion gets trapped and they separate once more. Add in an adorable little boy the Doctor will both relate to and feel responsible for, a family surrounding the boy in danger and you've got this episode *down*.

1. Amy and Rory get separated pretty definitively and tears are shed. Not everyone returns to the TARDIS at the end.

1. This one's going to be deep. The Doctor meets a creature who's having some serious self-worth issues and greets death like it's the only choice.

1. A light comedy with Craig and how the Doctor gleefully leaps into mundane life (getting a job, et al.) and making loads of friends along the way. In the end Craig realizes how much he loves someone, and this makes the villain go away.

1. The world's gone wibbly! The villian's over-aching plan has been executed and the Doctor and Company find themselves in a weird version of the world that is decidedly *not normal*. The only solution is to make heartfelt speeches to one another and watch the Doctor die. But of course he doesn't die! With a grin on his face we see that the Doctor doesn't have so much as a scratch on him! People leap with joy at this realization.

1. A Christmas story that re-imagines a famous Christmas novel *but with the Doctor*. Prepare for simple and heavily accentuated emotional morals about love and acceptance of death.

Its not a case of having influence over policy, its a case of knowing your industry and what direction it could potentially head in. 

The British fire service has maybe the highest percentage of professional fire fighters in a first world country. What is more likely, is that the UK will copy models of countries such as Germany that has far, far more volunteer firefighters. Also feasible, although not being discussed, is the establishment of a volunteer agency similar to THW in Germany to deal with the technical relief aspects of the fire brigades role (floods, debris clearance, etc)

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"My hands are up, calm down. Was not aware of the bachelorette party, but you're missing the point. I was not comparing Rory's bachelor party with Amy's ""cheating"". My point about bachelor parties is that Amy, just like any guy, should be allowed to 'have a fling' likes males can.

And enough with this ""boning"" and ""fucking"". Just like I said before, Amy did **not** join the Doctor on his travels with the sole intention planned out to sleep with him. It came into her head after she nearly died from the angels! She didn't plan it. Amy did not have a ""fling with her dream guy"" for more than a few minutes. Those weeks they spent together were *not* a romantic relationship. The only part that was the fling is when she tried to sleep with him. You keep considering the several weeks they travelled together as part of Amy's ""betrayal"" but it's not.

Yes there's a difference between compliance and respect. You say respect is ""alright, let's have two more adventures and then we can go get married"" but that's not what respect is. That is, however reluctantly it may be, compliance. Respect doesn't require one to comply at *any* point. Just as one can respect someone else's religion but never believe in it. Just because Rory wanted her to stop traveling doesn't mean Amy has to. Yeah that's more selfish, but we've already established that Amy is a bit selfish.

Also, just because Amy flirts with the Doctor and watches him undress doesn't make her a cheat. Married couples don't resolve to never check out someone of the opposite gender. And when Amy was checking out the Doctor she wasn't even engaged to Rory at that point. That's not a horrible crime. If by your standards a significant other can't even flirt or look at another guy...well gee.

Of course Amy didn't do anything- she didn't even *get a chance* to get her thoughts together. That's the point- she had no chance before the Doctor took her relationship into his hands and did it for her, as if she's not an adult who can tell Rory herself. There was no deceit because there wasn't even any time for deceit to brew. The chance to decide how she'd take account for her near-cheat was taken from her. No deceit.

You're missing the point about her travels again. The point was to run away, the point was to avoid Rory and the commitment he represented. Of course she was angry when he joined the crew. Rose was angry when Mickey joined. The fact that she didn't tell the Doctor she was engaged wasn't 'leading him on' or anything because she wasn't planning on sleeping with him! Her life long passion for him was born out of a kid's dream, like Santa Claus is to a kid. She didn't bother telling Rory she'd be gone because it's a time machine, she'd be back the minute after she left. Not telling Rory isn't cheating or being deceitful. At worst it's being inconsiderate because, should they get the time wrong, Rory will wonder where she went. But they wouldn't get the time wrong because the Doctor is very good at piloting his TARDIS now.

Rory risking his life to save Amy? Because that action just shows that you care deeply about that person. Amy's actions *guaranteed* her death in the reality when she didn't have to do that- she only did it because she knew Rory wasn't there. A world without Rory isn't a world worth living in. Both of their actions show their deep care for each other, but what Amy did had more direct causes to her romantic feelings toward him, not just feelings of deep caring.

She didn't lie through omission and her manipulation/abuse of Rory was again, in Vampires. When else does she manipulate Rory? Where are these heinous examples of Amy's constant deceit?

Fear of commitment is not childish. Commitment is by definition, one of the biggest sacrifices/responsibilities a person can undertake. Tons of adults everywhere have issues with commitment.

&gt;It's not ""I don't like Amy, so I don't like Amy's bahaviour."" It's ""I don't like Amy's bahaviour, so I don't like Amy""

You're putting words in my mouth. I said that your basic disagreement about Amy was understandable because you don't like her for all the reasons we have discussed in the previous thread. What I said is that it's basically up to *personal preference*, which means that your values just plain differ with Amy's. That doesn't mean someone's reasons are suddenly invalid. It's a perfectly reasonable excuse, everyone's entitled to their opinions and values. It doesn't mean you're shallow or anything. 

&gt;**RUNNING AROUND WITH ANOTHER GUY, EVEN IF YOU THINK IT'S A ""ONE TIME THING"" IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO A BACHELOR PARTY, AND IT IS CHILDISH TO THINK THAT'S AN EXCUSE.**

I was not equating Amy's actions to Rory's bachelor party. I used Rory's bachelor party as support for why it's *okay*, or at least traditional/understandable for Amy to try and have a ""one time thing"". Even if you don't think this is a good excuse you said that wasn't your biggest problem even though your above quote is cited as being your biggest point.

In your previous post you said:

&gt;No, it's not just the make out session and attempt to bone some childhood idol. That's something I can at least understand... It's the lying that I'm not cool with. 

You said lying, but now you're back to how horrible her trying to have a 'one time thing' was. She didn't lie, her one time thing wasn't planned, it didn't even last 5 minutes, and the bachelor party wasn't a comparison (as I addressed above). EDIT: Are you not going to forgive Amy her 5 minute mistake after she nearly died?

What else can I say? I've responded to all your arguments despite your going back and changing what you find most unforgivable about Amy's actions. Amy's actions stem from her personality of being more selfish than most companions, being fierce, and flirty. If you just don't agree with her values, her personality, her actions, then that's good. That doesn't make you immediately shallow. That doesn't make you a ""hater"" for hating's sake.

People aren't suing over hot coffee. They are suing because prisoners have nearly died in his torture camps. Because what he is doing is not justifiable in any civilised society.

It is particularly problematic in the US which tends to jail huge swathes of people for no particular sound reason. So you have torture camps applied to people who probably shouldn't be in prison to begin with.

The only reason Obama is chasing him is he's used the considerable leeway given to law enforcement there to avoid implementing the requirements of various courts. He is actively breaking the law and making the tax payer pay fines.

He has been chased around by the legal system in the US for about a decade at this point. Obama is just establishing some sense to bring a conclusion to it.

It is also worth noting that for all his hard line recidivism rates didn't budge. He also spends far more on fines and compensation than it would cost to run a civilised jail.

&gt;This is a govt. that has never been in control.

It is a coalition.  It quite clearly in control it's just that this government forms policy with compromise between its coalition members.

&gt;They wanted to switch off the internets during the riots but didn't only because of how it would've looked to China and other similar countries: that's a govt. out of control.

Nonsense.  There was no talk of switching off the Internet, being fully aware that that would have served to incite more rioting.  There was talk of banning people found to have been inciting violence and rioting from social media sites.  There was talk of social media sites being held and holding themselves more accountable.  They could have easily pulled local internet and mobile phone access by using the 2003 Communications Act and still left everyone else's Internet absolutely fine and in place -they already have that power.  There would have been no uproar.  They didn't pass the law and they didn't use it.

&gt;Scraps ID cards,

That's a good thing.

&gt;wants to monitor everything done digitally.

I think you'll find it's the security forces that are very much asking for greater powers, not that I agree with them, but the opposition has already come out on all sides - including prominent Tories, so even if it is aired next month in the Queen's Speech it still would have to go through both Houses.  The chair of the National Security Council has already come out against it if there isn't a provision to protect civil liberties and privacy - he also happens to be the leader of the lesser coalition member, so I wouldn't worry too much about this becoming reality.  They don't even have Conservative back benchers supporting it.

&gt;So far up Murdich's arse and the Chipping Norton set..

The PM lives in Chipping Norton.  Chipping Norton elected *him*.  He's allowed to have friends without being 'up arses'. As for up Murdoch's arse, he put the LibDem's Vince Cable in charge of the Murdoch monopoly investigation bid for BSkyB.  They'd have known exactly how he felt about Murdoch - Cable just failed to meet his professional requirements about keeping schtum whilst the investigation was on going.  They served Murdoch up on a plate to be brought down!  That's not being up Murdoch's arse, that's leaving him out to hang!!!

Also, have you noticed under which government Murdoch's crashed?  Blair was very close to News Int.  Blair attacked the BBC.

&gt;Privitising the NHS when no top-down reorganisation of the NHS was in their manifesto

It's sensationalist to say this bill is privatising the NHS.  The issues raised with it is that it may in the future lead to privatisation, but if you look at the figures its the NHS that is set to profit off private healthcare and the NHS budget has gone up.  Read the revised bill; it's not privatisation.

Healthcare reform was very much in the manifesto.  Page 45 of the manifesto to be precise:  

             ""We have a reform plan to make the changes the 
              NHS needs. We will decentralise power, so that 
              patients have a real choice...we will be able to
              cut the cost of NH S administration by a third and 
              transfer resources to support doctors and nurses on 
              the frontline...So we will give every patient the power 
              to choose any healthcare provider that meets NHS
              standards, within NH S prices. This includes independent,
              voluntary and community sector providers.""
 
Feel free to disagree with it, but it was all in their manifesto.  They didn't hide they were getting rid of PCTs.

&gt; The type of politics we have had for the last few centuries has done nothing for the working man but everything for the rich.

Woah, your history is rusty!  Worker's rights, employment law, pensions, working conditions, the NHS, the whole welfare system.  State schools are only a 140 years old. Compulsory secondary education is less than a hundred years old.

&gt;It's funny, I read a lot of history

Then how on Earth did you just manage to say *'the type of politics we have had for the last few centuries has done nothing for the working man but everything for the rich.'*  In the last century social provision has come on in leaps and bounds!

&gt; when Kings/Queens were scared of losing power or scared of the public, they introduced draconian laws.

Actually the opposite is true in the main, that's exactly how the concessions were made and why Kings and Queens these days have little more than a  ceremonial/figurehead role.  The Glorious Revolution was ended with William and Mary signing the English Bill of Rights, and they would have been very much so scared of the public and of forever losing the throne, the Bill which gave power to Parliament, for example.  The Habeas Corpus Act of 1679 was pushed by an Exclusionist, for another.  The Peasant's Revolt in 1381 marks the start of a period of land reform initiating the start of the end of serfdom in England.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"&gt; My hands are up, calm down. Was not aware of the bachelorette party, but you're missing the point. I was not comparing Rory's bachelor party with Amy's ""cheating"". My point about bachelor parties is that Amy, just like any guy, should be allowed to 'have a fling' likes males can.

Alright, please focus for a second. Amy (and all women in the western world) are treated with the *exact same* amount of freedom men are in this situation.

Rory (and all men of the western world) doesn't run off with another woman without telling Amy, claiming it's a ""one time thing before the wedding"", spending a week of his life effectively hiding from her with his idol because that would make him *a dick*.

No, (and I will say this again because it is vital) Amy *already had* her own ""fling"". She *had* her fun right before commitment, as you say bachelor parties are like. She had *the exact same party* Rory had.

Except Mel makes it sound that her bachelorette party *was even wilder than Rory's Stag*. So take that into consideration when viewing her running away from home.

But just so we're clear I'm going to recap: a bachelor party ≠ running from home with another guy. Not even a tiny bit. Two *very* different things.

Let me go on.

The Doctor is her dream guy. She made Rory dress up as him, makes dolls of him, writes stories of him, et al. Then when he reappears in Eleventh Hour she shows *clear* sexual interest in him.

She didn't leave to see the stars, and this is important. Unlike his other companions the Doctor never mentions that he can really travel or see incredible places. Her focus was not on the adventuring, but *the Doctor*.

The Doctor doesn't say ""I go on loads of adventures"" to little Amelia. He just shows up, acts funny, promises to take her with him later and then never comes back.

It wasn't the adventures she wanted, it was *him*, and this idyllic image of the Doctor only builds up over time to the point where it's a psychosis for her.

So when she decides to go with the Doctor *it's to be with the Doctor*.

Her sexual attraction to the Doctor may not have been *the factor*, but there was a greater factor: she was enamored by him the entire time.

If it was just a five-minute sexual pass, I'd call it a freebie. He is, after all, the Doctor. But this was, as you have said, total devotion to another man. She wanted to be with the Doctor more than she wanted to be with Rory.

Let me reiterate that:

She wanted to be with another man more than she wanted to be with Rory.

That's not just some five-minute pass. That's being willing to put your life at risk just to be with someone else. That's something *way* more personal than a simple sexual lunge. *That's* something that's to be upset about.

But again, that's not even the core thing. If I met the Doctor as a child, I'd leap in the TARDIS at the first chance I got and want to adventure with him for a good long time.

&gt; You say respect is ""alright, let's have two more adventures and then we can go get married"" but that's not what respect is. That is, however reluctantly it may be, compliance. Respect doesn't require one to comply at any point.

Respect is understanding the other parties feelings and being willing to accommodate them, just as they accommodate yours. Respect is all about understanding the other person's needs and at least making *an attempt* to address them. Amy just shrugs off most of his pleas or wants. This isn't like one person believing a religion and the other expected to just believe in it. This is someone asking for their brother to make it to their choir practice. Sure, you aren't mandated to come and they know you don't believe in it, but they really would like you to be there and it's an important moment for them. 

Respect is all about showing that you understand the other's position and that you actually care about it. As you have said, Amy shows more care for herself and her wants than for Rory's needs or desires. That isn't just selfish, that's being disrespectful because it's so clear that Rory wouldn't do the same.

&gt; Also, just because Amy flirts with the Doctor and watches him undress doesn't make her a cheat. Married couples don't resolve to never check out someone of the opposite gender. And when Amy was checking out the Doctor she wasn't even engaged to Rory at that point. That's not a horrible crime. If by your standards a significant other can't even flirt or look at another guy...well gee.

First, don't think it's a horrible crime. I was citing all that to prove that Amy had ideas about the Doctor long before those sudden five minutes, meaning that it likely factored in to some degree in her decision to go along with him. No one's saying you can't look at another person (even another person while they're undressing, which shows again how Rory is willing to give others respect while Amy will abandon that respect to get what she wants), but when you do look at another person lustfully while also having a shrine of them in your room it would be *stupid* to think that her five minute attempted rape was just ""one little fling"".

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"&gt; Of course Amy didn't do anything- she didn't even get a chance to get her thoughts together. That's the point- she had no chance before the Doctor took her relationship into his hands and did it for her, as if she's not an adult who can tell Rory herself. There was no deceit because there wasn't even any time for deceit to brew. The chance to decide how she'd take account for her near-cheat was taken from her. No deceit.

She didn't even leave a note. Remember that there was no rush. The Doctor didn't say ""get in the TARDIS, it's now or never"" (although seeing as he had abruptly left the last two times, I can see how she'd think that). Her first thoughts weren't of ""oh, better leave Rory a note"" (because remember, she wasn't assured that she could return to her wedding night until *after* she leapt in the TARDIS, meaning that she likely was planning on leaving regardless of whether she could be back in time or not). They were of ""ooh! TARDIS! Time to flee responsibility!"".

Additionally, the Doctor told her *deliberately told her* that she shouldn't be trying to bone him. They went into the TARDIS and if you'll note, Amy's changed clothes since Flesh and Stone in Vampires of Venice. She obviously would have needed to sleep after all that (and it's not like she's tired in Vampires of Venice) so she probably got a little shut-eye too. Also given her re-applied makeup and the fact that she doesn't look like she hasn't bathed since being covered in gravel and running through a cavern she probably showered too. This would seemingly indicate that a fair amount of time has passed since Flesh and Stone. Not a long time, but at the very least a night for Amy to think her actions over.

Then, if I note, the Doctor is the one to go get Rory. Not. Amy. 

The doctor had enough time to meet the stripper, get to know her, get into her cake, get wheeled into the bar, pop out of the cake, explain what he was doing there to Rory and then return to the TARDIS.

Amy does not enter the equation until they return to the TARDIS *from which Amy never left*. This is important: she didn't even get out to go get Rory. she later behaves like she's not too keen on the idea of bringing him along.

Now also note that at no point does Amy confess what she did to Rory.

Picture this for yourself: you've hit one the guy of your dreams and he says no. He then goes, gets your fiancee and brings him to meet you now that he knows you've been avoiding him.

I would think that the opportunity to confess is *pretty blatant*, but she *never does*. At *no point* does she admit what she did, let alone apologize. She keeps this information from Rory despite the fact that this is a pretty blatant opportunity to do so, but she doesn't.

And bullshit the Doctor's good at piloting the TARDIS now. He was one year off dropping Rose off, and was *two* years off coming back to meet Amy. And even then Amy has no idea how time travel works other than ""the Doctor often gets dates wrong and doesn't end up at the right time"". That's not exactly an iron-clad way of getting back before the wedding.

Alright, now let me get back to the lying vs. fling thing.

I am pointing out that vindicating Amy's actions by comparing them to Rory's stag party is absolutely absurd, and you've used it as an excuse for her actions several times. It holds no water, there's no comparison. The two things are on *completely* different levels. One actions does not justify the other, that's all I was pointing out.

I haven't changed anything. Yeah, running away with the Doctor's bad, but that's not the real issue here.

The real issue is that she never told Rory.

She didn't tell him she had left.

She didn't tell him she had tried to rape him.

She didn't tell him *any* of these things. She just kept him in the dark so that she could have her little fun and ignore all of her responsibilities. That's just totally and completely selfish and inconsiderate and deceitful.

You know what really burns me up about Amy? Is that for all her arrogance, for all her brash attitude and disregard for others and self-serving nature the one thing I can't stand is how she vindicates her every action through fear.

She vindicates her leaving and not telling Rory through fear. She vindicates her obsession with the Doctor and her need to be with him out of a fear of being left waiting again. She fears having to think of someone else before herself.

This fear is used to fuel intolerance (against Ganger Doctor, whom she was afraid of attempting to replace the Doctor), selfishness, and violence (shooting the little girl to save the Doctor, murdering Mme Kavorkian).

She's just so full of fear and hate that I honestly can't stand her. At least the other companions were fueled by other, more noble sources like love and exploration and independence and were fueled into selfless drives. But Amy's just afraid of having to open to anyone else and start *really* thinking of someone else, to mature and become selfless.",0,1334097450,null,0,false,0,c4aql2m,t3_s1j0m,t1_c4aql2m,t1_c4aqky7,null,1428694760,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

The trouble with the sudden rise of the middle class in China is they look straight to the west for guidance on how to live. I lost count of the number of students I had who bought expensive western labels not because it looked good, but because they believe it's what we all wear in over here. 

Some of their perceptions of life in the west are so wildly inaccurate it would be funny if it wasn't so sad. One of my students refused to believe I didn't own a car. He found it hard to believe I didn't own 2 cars, but impossible that I didn't even own one. ""But you live in the west, you are rich"".

The NHS is just one part of the discussion. Education, Welfare benefits, Policing and integration, justice, morals and culture are others. The point is we should be able to discuss these things without fear.

On a side note, there's always a select few whose argument for ""unfiltered immigration"" is ""Maybe they don't XXXX but they'll have children and their children will be English and will be integrated and a benefit to society.""

This is largely true and undeniable but the country needs money to function and deserves to be selective of who we take in. There is a lot of great cultural things from around world. I've been to Malaysian food festivals, Indian restaurants, learnt Maui Thai Kickboxing from a Brazillian, watched Anime and so forth. Immigrants they have a lot to offer. But all cultures have good and bad, including ours.

Some of our cultures bad habits (and this is only my opinion) include binge drinking and fast food. The people that have come here should be identify things about their own country or culture which is negative, for good and negative go together. If they can't maybe they should go back, because we have problems.

Case and point, they may have come here because there are no jobs back home. If that's the case, if that makes a country worth living in, we need to ensure we have jobs and work towards building that and giving both foreigners and natives the chance to do good work.

I'm not saying we squeeze immigrants for cash but they choose a country that benefits them and we should selective choose immigrants that mutually benefit us. Our charity goes a long way and I support human rights... but with unfiltered immigration we can't all pay our way, we don't all benefit and our shared quality of life drops. They came for a good quality of life and it should survive more than a single generation.

My real point is that Ten's death wasn't very fitting for him.

Throughout his life he was selfless and thoroughly pacifistic. He even reached a hand out to *the Daleks* for christsakes! The people who murdered everything he ever loved and forced him to kill his people, evil incarnate and he still offers them pity and a chance at redemption in both Daleks in Manhattan and reprimanding 10.5 for their genocide in the Stolen Earth.

He's been consistently empathetic to others and has always freely placed himself in danger to save the ones he cares about, seemingly caring less about himself staying alive as he did the feelings of others.

He'd always apologize if he ever did anything that remotely resembled causing someone else harm, and would always make it clear that any sort of violence was an absolute last resort (although his friends had to occasionally remind him of this).

And yet his last moments are a tantrum bemoaning the brevity of life and saying ""I don't want to go"". The Doctor's never been so pessimistic at heart. Even Nine (who would often go into bouts of darkness) ended his life on a positive note, saying that he had been ""fantastic"".

Like all people, Roman works with people around him and they do not seem to be the coaches, based only on the last 7 years. The board would be influential on his decision.  If we have a quality board of directors that have a plan (strategy for our development, the way we play, succession plans for playing in our youth), give good advice to roman when he goes, 'we need to get this player, wadda you reckon?' they can go, 'yeah he's great but we got gotta build the rest of the team, he'd be isolated and useless if he has shiity supply'.  and if roman would listen to anyone, it would be to one who has done what he wants to achieve - win champions league football, so it doesn't need to be saf but someone who he will respect and listen to, with the best interest in chelsea fc

as we all know, that no matter how good a player is, without support around him, he is shit.  messi for argentina not as good as playing for barca cause he has the top players around him in nearly all positions, he can play the way he does.  

if we have quality suppply to torres, he would be attacking the goal constantly.  sturridge, get the ball, keeps his head down when he should be looking to offload the ball to the 3 players who are open or does some shitty move and loses the ball.  if we had a team player with quality supply ie ribery at bayern, torres would be getting goals every game.

if our goal is to play quick tempo, exciting football, the board needs to say we gotta get some fast quality players and we all love lamps, drogba, and iva but even though they are tops, we gotta get some faster better players ie not raul

why can't we have the best squad in the world? why wouldn't ozil leave rm? not saying that we need him, it would be good to have a player like him controlling the team, making killer passes to torres, to wingers who don't choke and mess up our build up play.

i am not denying the influence of the 'men in suits' in the decision making process.  let's just get better men in suits so that when roman goes, i'm sick of my new toy (manager) i want him fired, the men in suits can go 'pull your head in buddy, we have a plan, let's stick to it'",0,1334100831,null,0,false,0,c4ar9jr,t3_s1isa,t1_c4ar9jr,t1_c4aqg1t,null,1428695107,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Black suits are more formal and should only really be worn to evening events or to funerals. A charcoal suit is much more versatile and can be worn pretty much any time a suit is required, including with subfusc. I suspect some of the posters here are not aware of the difference; lots of people wear charcoal suits in their subfusc.

Note also that subfusc calls only for a ""dark suit""- a dark navy might work here as well. I've seen it done before successfully. It will definitely stand out a little, so it's up to you if you want that.

Regarding the tuxedo, you'll need one if you want to take part in many of Oxford's social events- generally dinners and balls. You don't strictly need one to be a student, but you'll almost certainly want one. I'd suggest getting one if you can.

Finally, please for the love of god do not wear a tuxedo with subfusc. It looks awful and is a complete bastardization.

As I have explained to numerous people who downvote: I don't care about the numbers/karma (in before you say ""yeah right lol!"") but rather I care, or have an interest in, what the downvote demonstrates about the mentality of the person I'm talking to. This could be one of a couple of things.

If it's early on in the thread then I suspect it is betraying an internal conflict or immaturity when it comes to that person's debating skills: Either they're 'upset' by the opposing argument and/or are unable to counter it sufficiently and must 'punish' their opponent with the devastating blue arrow. Hitting out at their opponent because they can't verbalise their discomfort sufficiently. Or they haven't read the [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) - not commandments as such, but guidelines to stop this site slipping into a potential cesspool of idiocy. (By the by, [my personal voting of you stands at +1 overall](http://i.imgur.com/24TTI.png), where it's been since before we started this thread. Does that tell you anything? And I know you won't be serious in answering that question - I realise you don't want to begin to let yourself think that way - so let's leave it rhetorical.)

Or there's the alternative, which I think you fall under, where you've gone beyond being grumpified by me pointing out your amusing refusal to consider my very simple original question and now think you've convinced yourself this is all beneath you and believe you're being all funny and clever. Isn't it all hilarious!

Bet you slapped your knee, eh? What a silly person this guy is! No need to consider that question, it was asked by a silly person! Thank feck I ignored it in the first place! This silly guy - the one who you assumed was your political opposite and you made assumptions about and were oh-so-mature and ad hommed. That doesn't bother me, by the way, but it should bother you that you couldn't answer one simple question, or at least defend it on its own without passing judgement on what you assumed my politics were etc. 

I'll ask again:

[""If a child goes to a charity to be fed, because its family has no money due to being ineligible for work or benefits: How is that child and/or family ""leeching"" from the state](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/rwp6x/look_back_in_hunger_britains_silent_scandalous/c49bvil)?""

You *must* understand the simple question I'm asking - I don't take you for being actually stupid. You can comprehend the issue to which I refer. But your continued refusal to answer does absolutely nothing to convince me that you've formed your opinions in a rational manner. Do you realise that you have the opportunity to demonstrate that your obviously sincerely held opinions are reasonable? At the moment you're giving me the impression - that actually a number of others who hold these sorts of opinions have too - that you don't need to justify your position to ""one of those terrible lefties"". You realise that at the moment I'm pretty much convinced that you aren't able to explain your original comment without admitting that you have particular opinions that can't be shaken by empirical evidence?

Don't get too distressed about my comment in the other thread. I wrote the comment asking you about it that post then realised that you might have already seen it, so went to check if you'd commented. As I saw you'd used the word ""leeches"" again, I thought it only right to point out your refusal to answer my original question.

Scouse-wise, I'm OK on that front: The better half is from up that way and one is enough at the moment, ta. But I don't think two Scouses can do that sort of thing - I swear Doc Brown mentioned it in Back to the Future 3: Doesn't that kind of behaviour implode the space-time continuum?

Even when it comes to something as simple as the north south divide... I find it quite sad that people have to draw even more imaginary lines in the dirt.

For the record, because I get the impression you might find it important (though you've made it clear you're always going to be able to find the ""us and them"" element): we were born on the same island and grew up in similar latitudes, though I was slightly more downhill than you. And as far as the genealogy of my family is concerned, they seem to have been here for some time too. Not that I find that particularly important: I don't see people from overseas as being icky and I'm not of the opinion that I would somehow be 'less worthy' if a parent had come from *not-inside-the-UK*.

Though why the feck you think it's important as to whether or not I'm British is an intriguing issue in and of itself. Would that give you an opportunity to dismiss my question on how you apparently justify your leeches opinion on the basis of a non-leeching issue, after I made it clear that you had no idea what my politics were?

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"&gt;Rory (and all men of the western world) doesnt' run off with another woman without telling Amy...

Besides the fact that your statement is way to general to be true (maybe it's my cynicism but that statement is risible). And when, in the western world of this reality, do time travelling aliens who were your childhood idol ever pop up and offer you the universe? This wouldn't be a problem if the Doctor was female. Right up until the 'getting into the pants' thing.

Once again, you're equating running away with the Doctor as betrayal. Is it? Even when up until Angel/Forest's end she hadn't tried to get into his pants and did not plan to? (flirt yes)

And as we both agreed, bachelor/bachelorette parties are acceptable. So you can't condemn Amy for having one, no matter how wild hers was because Rory could've chosen to have a wild one too. Plus Mel is the type to exaggerate...

I'm going to recap too: I'm not comparing bachelor parties to what Amy did! I've said this many times. They both had a party so they're ""even"", it's all cool there.

But either way ""running from home with another guy"" is generalizing. This guy is the Doctor and she wasn't having romantic relations with him.

When the series first aired and she left in the Eleventh Hour, did you immediately think that what she was doing was some kind of cheat? And do you think that her traveling with him, when they had no romantic relationship, was Amy betraying Rory?

&gt;the Doctor never mentions that he can really travel or see incredible places

Yes he does. He asks her if she wants to 'check' out more planets. He said that all that stuff with Prisoner Zero and the Atraxi- there was loads more of that. That it was 'just the beginning'.

&gt;But this was, as you have said, total devotion to another man.

What? No! That's not what I said *at all*. I said she was totally obsessed with the Doctor. Obsession is different from devotion. One of the things I've been spouting on and on about in our conversation is that no matter what, Amy always loved Rory. Remember when I said it'd be worse if she actually wanted to have a long term relationship with the Doctor? Remember I said that would be worse than being cheated on with a one time fling? Now you're agreeing with me that that's worse to be cheated on by a long-term relationship.

But as I said those many posts ago, Amy has always been loyal to Rory, even if she wated her fling with the Doctor. That WAS a five minute pass. Amy's obsession was lifelong, but her sexual attraction was a fling.

In regards to respect, I think that it's not as drastic as religion but more serious than making it to a 'choir practice'. After all, if Amy stopped travelling and settled down, that would be the end of her travelling. The Doctor wouldn't come back for her, just like he doesn't come back for his other companions. Sure he dropped them off in God Complex, but that was a pit stop while he looked for their lost daughter, not good-bye for good. Amy choosing to travel or settle down is bigger than making a choir practice. It was a life decision that would have long term effects. This travelling was important to Amy just as much, if not more, than how important settling down was to Rory. Except that apparently it wasn't as important to Rory because he didn't give her an ultimatum and say ""if you can't settle down with me this relationship won't work."" Since it didn't come to that, things stayed as they were and that makes it fine. It was selfish, but it did no harm.

The thing is, is that if you were Rory, I bet you would've put your foot down and insisted much more fervently. You care more than Rory does about making Amy settle down. But he's the one in the relationship so it's his choice to take it or leave her.

To note, Rory wasn't respecting the Doctor by looking away, he's straight, he has no interest in watching the Doctor. And if he did watch (with or without 
disinterest) he could be accused of being gay, and heaven forbid someone is *gay* in our society...

I agree with you that Amy's sexual attraction contributed to her decision to travel with the Doctor, but as you said yourself, it wasn't a huge factor. And as you also said yourself, if you were in her position  (childhood friend and the universe) you'd jump at the chance. So even without the sexual factor, she would've gone. And as I said above (and many posts ago) it was a fling, not a long term relationship. (You also said you'd forgive the fling, about 2 or 3 posts ago).

Amy's brief lust and her lifelong obsession are not bases for long term relationships. Lust is obviously not one, and then lifelong obsession is not healthy. Except her lifelong obsession was a nonsexual one and only became sexual once he briefly turned up again over a decade later. So I think it's safe to say that this was definitely a fling (you did not dispute my earler claim to it being mere a ""fling"" many posts ago).

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"&gt; Besides the fact that your statement is way to general to be true (maybe it's my cynicism but that statement is risible). And when, in the western world of this reality, do time travelling aliens who were your childhood idol ever pop up and offer you the universe? This wouldn't be a problem if the Doctor was female. Right up until the 'getting into the pants' thing.

First, I meant that it's never okay for that to happen. That's not acceptable, that's not the standard, and it's a selfish and hurtful action that's wrong no matter what gender does it. This *would* be a problem, regardless of which gender the Doctor is, because it's running off with someone you are sexually attracted to and idolize to try and escape commitment.

&gt; Once again, you're equating running away with the Doctor as betrayal. Is it? Even when up until Angel/Forest's end she hadn't tried to get into his pants and did not plan to? (flirt yes)

Betrayal? No. I mean, Rory assumed she was not going to go time travelling before the wedding, but that's just common sense. She did, however, leave without leaving a note. If there's one thing I've learned from one-armed people it's that you *always* leave a note. 

All joking aside, she stole away in the night without telling him. Stealing off, might I remind you, with another guy whom she is *deeply* infatuated by. She did this with the specific intent of fleeing her responsibilities instead of at the very least talking to Rory about it. She makes a move to do something self-serving at the cost of what Rory trusted her to do. Remember again that all she knows about the TARDIS is that it rarely brings you on time, and even then she doesn't ask if she can be back in time until *after* she's already decided to go. As if this event (that's incredibly important to Rory) is an afterthought.

&gt; When the series first aired and she left in the Eleventh Hour, did you immediately think that what she was doing was some kind of cheat? And do you think that her traveling with him, when they had no romantic relationship, was Amy betraying Rory?

I'm not saying it's *cheating*. Wrong, deceitful, and immature, yes. Insensitive, inconsiderate, rude? Yes. But you can't really call it cheating at that point, because the whole sexual aspect hasn't *totally* come to a head (you're aware that it's there, but it's not at the forefront *yet*). I thought ""Wow, this girl is leaving with the Doctor on her wedding night. That's kind of insensitive to whoever she's marrying, I guess"", but it wasn't until you got to know Rory and realize that she treats him like this *all the time* and how incredibly sweet and kind he is to her that I realized how terribly inconsiderate that is. And she isn't even apologetic after the fact. I mean, if someone was planning on *maybe* missing *the wedding* I would expect at least the tiny bit of sheepishness form the fleeing culprit, but not even the slightest modicum of shame is spent from Amy.

But every depiction she had wasn't of the planets she'd see or the adventures she'd go on. It was all about *him*. It may not have started that way, but it quickly devolved into this obsessive fixation on him as an archetype. Think LINDA if they never moved on and did other things and LINDA is just one person.

Be it obsession or devotion, it was an *intense* attraction to the Doctor in a *profound* way. An infatuation so deep she needed *therapy*. She didn't just want him sexually (although it's obvious she'd harbored such thoughts since Eleventh Hour) she just *wanted him*. Wanted to be with him, wanted to just be a part of his life. That's the sort of feelings that might make an average man a little jealous, but Rory's got the patience of a turtle and is willing to put up with all of Amy's issues.

But the point is that for all intents and purposes she was infatuated with the Doctor and just wanted him so badly. That really, really hurts. The idea that there's another man your spouse rather be with than yourself, especially in a time when you *really* need her, is something that stings. Bad. Rory's made of *tough stuff* to handle that so level-headedly.

&gt; In regards to respect, I think that it's not as drastic as religion but more serious than making it to a 'choir practice'. 

To some people it's one event that makes the world of difference. To a child it's having a parent come to every ball-game or have a friend attend a birthday party, or in adulthood have a friends come support them at a family member's wake or help them move or attend their college graduation. All of those things are important moments in a relationship where you turn to someone and say ""I need you"". If there's a shared respect between the two of them this shouldn't even need be asked. That's just a relationship, be it family or friendship they work together to help each other out in times of need. Rory needed Amy. Amy went off to have fun with the Doctor. That's just really selfish and disrespectful.

&gt; The Doctor wouldn't come back for her, just like he doesn't come back for his other companions.

Amy has literally no idea of this. From what she's seen (and from what the Doctor tells her) he *always* comes back. Comes back very late, but comes back. 

&gt; Sure he dropped them off in God Complex, but that was a pit stop while he looked for their lost daughter, not good-bye for good.

He wasn't looking for their lost daughter at that point. He had caught up with River back in Let's Kill Hitler and from there knew that River was fine. He was saying goodbye because he thought he was going to die. Remember that the next episode is him revisiting Craig and saying goodbye to him, as he's on a ""farewell tour"". He meant that as a goodbye. He also comes back for them. Make of that what you will.

&gt; This travelling was important to Amy just as much, if not more, than how important settling down was to Rory. Except that apparently it wasn't as important to Rory because he didn't give her an ultimatum and say ""if you can't settle down with me this relationship won't work."" Since it didn't come to that, things stayed as they were and that makes it fine. It was selfish, but it did no harm.

It was important to Rory. It states often that this is how he's always wanted to live his life. He just cares about Amy so much and is so scared of losing her that he'd never offer her an ultimatum, because she'd be liable to take it. You *presume* that since Rory doesn't object it must be alright, but if you honestly believe that you're not understanding what kind of a man Rory is.

He's the man who will take ridicule for being a nurse because he wants to help people. He's the man who would look past all of Amy's psychotic obsession with the Doctor because he loves her. He's the man who will always back down when it's him at stake, but will *never* back down if it's someone else. 

That's who he is. He's not going to give ultimatums when he could just bend to Amy's will. He's the sort of man who will do things he hates for someone he loves. That's Rory.

Rory feels all of this pain, and he shows it. Did you not see the look on his face when Amy cried out for the Doctor over the tracking implant? He feels every sting she deals to him with her thoughtlessness, but he trudges on with a stiff upper lip, because he loves her. He feels just as badly as I do, but he's not the sort of man to slam his foot down like that against her, because he's too afraid of losing her.

&gt; To note, Rory wasn't respecting the Doctor by looking away, he's straight, he has no interest in watching the Doctor. And if he did watch (with or without disinterest) he could be accused of being gay, and heaven forbid someone is gay in our society...

You're presuming Rory's homophobic, or that he's afraid of being called gay. He's a *nurse*, an occupation often associated with women. He's secure in his sexuality, but he is very polite and respectful of other people.

&gt; I agree with you that Amy's sexual attraction contributed to her decision to travel with the Doctor, but as you said yourself, it wasn't a huge factor. And as you also said yourself, if you were in her position (childhood friend and the universe) you'd jump at the chance. So even without the sexual factor, she would've gone. And as I said above (and many posts ago) it was a fling, not a long term relationship. (You also said you'd forgive the fling, about 2 or 3 posts ago).

This *wasn't* a fling. This was *weeks* of her life spent with someone she was *intensely* infatuated with. If it was *Actually* five minutes and *only* five minutes, it's forgivable. But it wasn't. 

It was her, running off. Sorry, *running away*. Away from Rory without telling him. 

&gt; Also your description of Amy's pass at the Doctor as an ""attempted rape"" is something I find personally insulting. Rape is serious and what she did was nowhere close to what rape is.

*Attempted* rape is when one member attempts to have sexual intercourse with a non-consenting partner. That's the legal definition. The Doctor didn't give consent. In fact, he straight-up said no. And yet she threw him around and tried to have sex with him. I don't care how mild you think that is. It is *definitionally* attempted rape. I understand there are cases that are more severe than this one, but that does not magically make this not attempted rape. It was.

And there's one note I made that you seem to have skipped: Amy never apologized for this. She never even confessed to Rory she *had* a fling. *THAT'S* what I'm talking about. The lying, the deceit, the hiding the truth. Be it leaving with the doctor or hiding that she tried to bone him, she obfuscates and tries to keep Rory in the dark. That's what's not cool, and I've been pretty specific about that.",0,1334113097,null,0,false,0,c4atu5o,t3_s1j0m,t1_c4atu5o,t1_c4at681,null,1428696345,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I don't know if you actually read the article, but that is essentially the point that the article made.

There were some parts focused on how dumb it was to get rid of Mourinho, but I would say that the majority of the article focused on the fact that Emenalo and the rest of the higher-ups at Chelsea are 'yes men' who don't have the cajones to tell Abramovich that he is wrong about:

1) purchasing overvalued and overrated players for tens of millions of pounds, when we would be better off buying a host of undervalued players and inexpensive early 20-somethings with that money

2) purchasing one or two high profile youth players for huge amounts of money (Lukaku, De Bruyne, etc.) when we have yet to have a single youth player make it through to the first team and contribute in any important way

3) purchasing players who do not fit into any one system, let alone the system of the manager in charge, meaning that we are left with a hodge-podge of players from a variety of systems that a manager is forced to jam into a starting 11 whether he has the right pieces or not (i.e. strikers like Sturridge playing on the wing, playing a lone striker despite having no true wingers to provide service to a lone striker since Robben/Duff/Cole left, not having had a true RB or a strong CB pairing since the days of Terry/Carvalho, having a roster with far too many defensive-minded midfielders)

4) spending large amounts of money on managers that could be better used to build a squad full of role players and long-term replacements for Lamps/Drogs/Terry/Essien/Cole/Cech under the tutelage of a long-term manager who has the full trust of the owner and the higher-ups

As for answering your question, pharmaceutical R&amp;D is already paid for with public money, albeit indirectly.

As you can see from [this graph](http://localhostr.com/files/K7aGgWU/capture.png) from the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations' ""[The Pharmaceutical Industry in figures - 2010 edition](http://www.efpia.eu/content/default.asp?PageID=559&amp;DocID=9158)"", in the UK 93.4% of the costs of pharmaceuticals are paid for by the NHS.

Pharmaceutical companies only spend circa 15% of their revenues on R&amp;D. In 2011 Pfizer's R&amp;D spend was only 13.5% of their revenue.

The price of a generic drug is, on average, 70% cheaper than one encumbered by a patent monopoly.

Thus, if the patent monopoly is removed and all drugs become generic, the cost to the NHS, for new drugs, will be only 30% of the current spend. If we then allocate 20% of the current spend (which is higher than the 15% spent by the pharmaceutical companies themselves) to research and development, we can actually **increase** R&amp;D funding while at the same time as **reducing** cost, by as much as 50% for the same drugs.

As for who does the clinical trials? These could be private companies under contract - contracts that would ensure that **all** trial data gets published (there is a significant positive bias in trial reporting at the moment) and that trials are performed relative to existing drugs as well as relative to placebo (the incentive won't be to boost the company's patent portfolio, it'll be to ensure the [relative] efficacy of the drug). Alternatively this could be performed by the public or charitable sectors but I see no reason to limit the scope of organisations to can perform trials if they are properly regulated.",0,1334117139,null,0,false,0,c4auo52,t3_rru2p,t1_c4auo52,t3_rru2p,null,1428696722,2,false,PiratePartyUK,t5_2rhop,2

true,Kalivha,eng-warwickshire,Coventrry/Edinburgh,"""Unfiltered immigration""? Seriously? Despite what people think, it's not possible to migrate to the UK without funds from your home country.

--This is coming from an immigrant who's continuously putting foreign money into the UK economy.

If you want to look at ""unfiltered immigration"", look at other countries. I am moving to Pakistan next month. Apart from paying the visa fee (which, by the way, is a reciprocal fee, so UK citizens pay a lot and I don't), it is *much* easier to move there than to move here. The reason I'm doing it (or one of them, anyway)? I'm gaining a lot of foreign money, including Pakistani money, to put back into UK spending on my return. I know, unorthodox strategy, but it works. Ultimately, Pakistan is winning too because I'm ""improving relations"" by going there. Most migration I've witnessed actually works like that as long as the people involved are decent human beings, and whether you are one usually has very little to do with what country you came from originally.

I won't even get into the terrorism thing.

A small note on the original topic of this thread: I've lived in an asylum seekers flat in my home country. Or rather, my family usurped it so we lived there with three people instead of loads of asylum seekers.

I think if a council house can be a home for 9 humble people who happen to not have been born here rather than 2 ""proper British people"", it's a good thing. I've helped British immigrants back home get social benefits and I'd like that sort of thing to be reciprocated.

And the Doctor did specifically tell her that she could be back at any time- she even asks if they could be back 'tomorrow' and he said absolutely. And she would've come back because she is loyal to Rory. Amy is an adult, she would've eventually decided ""it's time to face the real world"".

Cold feet isn't abandoning your responsibilities, it's when you get nervous because you're about to make the biggest commitment ever. And as we established, she would've gone anyway, even if her wedding wasn't so close, even if she didn't have cold feet, and even if Rory happened to be there and came with them.

&gt;""Rory assumed she was not going to go time travelling before the wedding, but that's just common sense""

The Doctor came for her in a random night she wasn't expecting. His arrival wasn't planned. Rory would not make any assumptions because he wouldn't even know about it. It's a coincidence that the Doctor even appeared one day before Amy's wedding. With that in mind, my cold feet/escape commitment explanation could be utter crap. In which case, she just left with him because it's *him*. Her childhood idol, chance to travel the universe, and kind of now-sexy friend.

She didn't stop to consult Rory about travelling because that's the general idiocy of companions in general. Rose didn't think about it, Martha didn't think about it, only Donna planned because she happened to meet him ahead of time. The companions drop everything at that moment and join him. You could call them selfish for not considering their families. But none of them expected the Doctor to show up (except Donna).
Since she didn't expect his arrival, her leaving with him in 11th Hour wasn't ""wrong, deceitful, and immature"". There's nothing wrong with travelling with the Doctor (w/ infatuation), it wasn't deceitful because, just like Vampires of Venice, she didn't even have a *chance* or any time for deceit to brew, and it wasn't immature because travelling with someone you idolize and even like a bit more than you should in order to see the universe isn't immature.

It's also not ""insensitive, inconsiderate, rude"" because the Doctor told Amy that they could be back whenever. The fact that Amy checked with the Doctor shows that her wedding and Rory *did* factor into her considerations. Because they could be back whenever there was no chance of her missing the wedding (as far as the Doctor led her to believe).

Yes, Amy's decision to travel was a large factor of wanting to be in the Doctor's life. It wasn't sexual, it was infatuation as you say. I think that because of Amy's obsession (therapy), it should be understandable and excusable that the Doctor would be a large factor in why she'd want to travel with him. Childhood idol after all. And she didn't want him because she thought the Doctor was a better person than Rory was (heavens no), she wanted him because he seemed like a magical archetype, not a real person. She didn't want to have a long term relationship with the Doctor ever. So what she did wasn't wrong at all. There's nothing wrong with a woman having more than one man be a large part of her life so long as that other many isn't *romantically* involved (they never were, she was obsessed and it only reached a sexual point, sort of). Sure, I can see how that would easily make an ordinary guy jealous, but that doesn't make what she did wrong.
""especially in a time when you *really* needed her""

There was no special situation of dire need except for the wedding which Amy wasn't going to miss (accurate time machine).
Rory didn't need Amy in that way. There was no specific trying time he was going through. He didn't need her more intensely than usual. He wanted to settle down, she didn't. That's not the same kind of need, it's not ""I'm having major emotional trauma, I need you to comfort me"", it's a ""we need to make a decision about our relationship. I think we should settle down, this is very important to me"". And Amy's response is, ""Not yet, this is my only chance to see the universe. This is also important to me, travel with us and we’ll settle down later"" And Rory's essential response, ""Okay, but please, soon."" And they did get a house and settle (beginning of Impossible Astronaut). And as far as we know, they're going to settle for good in the next series.

So besides the fact that respect is not compliance, and besides the fact that Rory is okay with it, Amy does, in the end, comply. Which you cited earlier as what respect would be- if she had said, 'later'. And essentially that's what did happen. There was no disrespect here.
""comes back very late, but comes back""

This implies that Amy still expects him to save her or return for her. But if they were to settle down, that would be their final good-bye. They would be ""moving on"" as companions do in the show. Amy would get back to her life with Rory and the Doctor would probably be thinking ""another one has flown the nest"" (3rd Doctor &amp; Jo).

As for the God Complex, if that was the Doctor's final goodbye to them, then there you go, Amy settled down with Rory. It's the Doctor's fault she didn't know it was THE goodbye because he misled them. And since he comes back, it means that it's not THE goodbye, and Amy never knew it was, so from her POV, her choices make sense. She hadn't reached THE goodbye when her only chance to see the universe would end. So keep travelling while you can...you'll never get to after THE end.

The fact that Rory was willing to give up his want to settle down to make Amy happy with her travelling just means he loves her a lot. That doesn't mean Amy is a jerk. And if Rory did give Amy that ultimatum, she would definitely choose him. Just because she's callous and selfish doesn't mean she would give up the man she loved the most to keep travelling. It's emphasized that she is loyal to Rory in the end, when things get real (her speech in A Good Man Goes to War). Since Rory doesn't object, that makes what Amy did *okay*. It wasn't ""wrong"" or ""right"", those terms are moral absolutes. What she did was selfish, but if Rory was willing to accept her actions instead of break off their relationship, then it IS okay. He may not be happy with it, but it's okay. It would only *not* be okay if Rory decided that he'd had enough of her crap and gave her the ultimatum.

What's defined as ""okay"" is defined by Rory's willingness to accept it. With this definition, yes, it's okay. As for the moral absolutes of right and wrong, those are too black-and-white. One could argue it's *wrong* to be selfish, but I wouldn't go that far. I'd say it's not good to be selfish, but it's not some fundamental flaw in Amy's morality that makes her a bad character. At most, it makes her what we've always established: she's selfish. But Rory is okay with her selfishness (which is not the moral absolute wrong) so within the confines of Rory's willingness and their relationship, it IS okay.

Rory doesn't not slam his foot down because he's afraid of losing her, he doesn't slam his foot down because he knows that while the Doctor is not her romantic partner, he does mean a lot to Amy. Plus, he was hurt because he thought that Amy was talking about the Doctor being the center of her world (which was so boring till he dropped out of the sky). But Amy proves her loyalty- she was talking about Rory being the center of her life. Rory was hurting because he thought she truly loved the Doctor, not because Amy wanted to travel against his wishes.
Rory's not homophobic, but the audience could (and some inevitably would find it odd) see it that way. Our society's standards don't allow for Rory to keep looking at the Doctor, which isn't fair, but that's how it is. He didn't turn his back out of respect, but out of social convention.
It *was* a fling. This is a fundamental difference in opinion between us. Those weeks she spent with the Doctor weren't romantic or part of ""a long term fling"" imo. They don't count because she wasn't making advances or hinting at something more or any interest. Her first real pass at trying to get him interested IS those five minutes. Her infatuation was only minorly based on the sexual. It mostly stemmed from her obsession.

And it was absolutely not rape. When a girl or guy tries to kiss another and makes a sexual advance and the other is reluctant and then the first insists more and the other says no more loudly and they stop, that's not rape. That's what happened between Amy and the Doctor. But not even that far. She hinted to him that she was interested (and he was oblivious), then she came onto him, he dodged her, made excuses, she said it was nothing long term, started snogging and pulling off his suspenders, that's when he pulls them up whilst making more excuses and then has an epiphany. He did not ""straight-up say no"" or say 'stop'. He said neither of those words.

&gt;I understand there are cases that are more severe than this one, but that does not magically make this not attempted rape.

ANY kind of rape is severe. The very action itself is as ignoble as murder if not worse. It’s the utmost violation of a person.
That was not rape. If Amy then became physically aggressive and used her strength to physically subdue the Doctor (which I doubt she could) THAT would be rape.

Amy was not planning on forcing the Doctor to sleep with her should he refuse, she wasn't going to tie him down and hold him at gun point (which is really the only way she'd be able to rape him). The idea of her raping him is absolutely ludicrous. The situation doesn't fit, her personality doesn't fit, and I don't think it would be physically possible for her to.

If this really was attempted rape, you think it would have caused controversy. People would be writing in letters. There would be outrage- they can't put that in a family show. But in this video, the actors just call it what it is and I'm sure that general society would agree that this is not rape. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNeXmFwEB9o Even Karen Gillian says she did it in the heat of the moment after sharing a near death experience with him.

I doubt a woman would ever even try to rape a man. Certainly not anyone who would ever appear on Doctor Who. I don't think you understand. I don’t think you realize how serious rape is. All rape is severe. Rape is scary and traumatizing, and the tone of that scene did not resemble that in any way. It was arguably the most lighthearted scene of the episode. Besides the fact that it's physically unlikely, when you spend your whole life surrounded by people who could potentially force you down and rape you, you take numerous precautions wherever you go in public (and as a female I know this wholeheartedly). From avoiding being alone near men wherever you are, and whether or not there are witnesses around you to keeping pepper spray, learning self defense, and possibly carrying a weapon with you (extreme measure) along with tons of other precautions, the idea of a woman having the mentality for rape is almost as ludicrous as your initial claim. It is insulting. And whether you wholeheartedly disagree with me or not, I am not going to argue this point with you.

In fact, there’s little reason to continue this conversation at all. Not only am I tired of it, but I have addressed every one of your concerns. And every time you choose a new flaw of Amy’s to focus on, I just repeat my same explanations, be it her “deceit” , her failed “fling” (which you initially did not object to be called a fling), or the idea of her treating Rory badly. Which means that you are either stuck in a loop or you just fundamentally disagree with me on whether or not something is considered “bad” or “unforgivable” or whatever. I think it’s the ladder and that it would save us a lot of time if we just agreed to disagree. Then we could move on to some topics that we can actually reach a conclusion. We’re not even arguing about what happened, we’re just arguing about whether or not what Amy did makes her a bad character. Which in fact, is an argument based completely upon opinion and values.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"Thanks for removing me from the spam filter, and for the extremely prompt, well thought out response.  

I'm curious the degree to which you'd extend this logic to other industries. For instance, if you invalidated all patents related to the production of microchips, manufacturing would move exclusively to OEMs, and you could significantly decrease the cost of the current generation of hardware. But that doesn't mean that there would be a next generation, because Intel, AMD and ARM, if they managed to avoid bankruptcy, would not longer be able to justify the development of new manufacturing processes necessary to further reduce transistor size.

One could say in response- well, why not just increase public research funds? But do you think a government body could replicate what, for instance, ARM does? It seems to me, even if they could set up an organization which behaved in an identical way, it would slip over time, because there would be no effective incentive to do its job well (if ARM becomes bad at its job, it goes bust, and is replaced by another company, but as a government body it would be protected), and because it would become politicized (why is the government supporting these eggheads doing their airy fairy work when we could spend the same money to employ three times the number of people elsewhere!). It wouldn't work for all the same reasons that nationalized industries have been discredited, and for the same reasons that ideas produced in universities are spun out into separate companies. Public bodies simply do not have the focus for effective commercialization.

For pharmaceuticals, the problems become even greater than for microchips, especially around politicization:

* Every time there was an expensive failure, it would become a scandal in the press, equivalent to the overspend on Wembley, or budget over-runs on the Olympics (the cost of commercializing a drug is about $1.7bn, which is about a third of the original Olympics budget, more than the cost of Wembley, and about ten times the cost of a normal stadium).

* The link between demand for a drug, or for pharmaceuticals in general, and the ability for researchers to meet that demand, would be broken, and research funding, which has increased in Europe from 7 billion to 35 billion in the last 20 years (p9 of the report you quoted), would become subject to political whim.

* There would be huge public pressure to end animal testing, even if it was necessary for the development process.

* There would be pressure to use 'our drugs' within the NHS, in order to justify the expenditure.

* There would be politicization of which drugs were developed (although that is arguably a good thing)

What would happen is that the research would be pursued for a little while, and then slowly dropped as politicians realized it was more trouble than it was worth, and liable to damage their re-election chances.

Also, when you talk about 15% of the expenditure going on R&amp;D, it looks very bad, but it's more or less reasonable if you roll the figures around. Firstly, the data is skewed by generics sales- the more money a pharma company makes from generics, the lower its R&amp;D percentage goes. Secondly, it ignores reasonable costs of doing business- for instance administration, management and production costs in feedstocks, manufacturing plants and so on. It bears saying that pharma has one of the highest R&amp;D percentages [of any industry](http://www.strategy-business.com/media/image/05406-exhibit_0ab.gif). The only really unjustifiable costs are through marketing and lobbying. The best way to deal with those is simply to ban them, preferably through international agreement. Similiarly, I would advocate a worldwide requirement to register trials, and a formal system for reducing licensing costs according to the wealth of the patient.

The final, I think fundamental argument, is that, if it was more efficient to do this through taxation funded research, couldn't we outcompete private companies in a mixed market? Set up a publicly funded pharma research company, that simply gets the drug to market, but which does no licensing or production, and the money saved through buying its products, when they are developed, would be sufficient to justify its continued existence. If this sounds like something which would never happen, because of the difficulty of setting it up, the level of public expenditure necessary, and because the benefits would only be felt a long time in the future, whereas the next election is in three years, well, there's exactly your argument why you need to keep private pharma companies around (even if we do raise public science expenditure, especially in basic and applied science, in the stages before commercialization).

true,[deleted],null,null,"As to getting ""better,"" New Who is in a lot of ways a fundamentally different show than Old Who. Most importantly: IMO it's not really a children's show anymore (not that it hadn't left that box to some degree during the last half of the first run, but it certainly began as one). Sure it's kid friendly, but it's been sexed up beyond the ""hot aliens in miniskirts"" of the 70s (think Jack). New Who is a prime time family-friendly genre show that is aware of its adult fan base and is in most ways more targeted to their desires than kids. Also, we're kind of unable to put ourselves in the cultural context that the classic series' viewers watched it in, so ""better"" is relative to 21st century tastes. And then there are the atrociously campy classic monsters, which really hampers my viewing pleasure.

As to the up and downs of other long-running shows, Lost for example, I think that DW is somewhat divorced from those confines. More than any other show in the history of television Doctor Who is built to ""regenerate"" or reboot itself while still maintaining continuity. The show could go from relatively dark and bleak to outright campy depending on changes in the audience &amp; producers' tastes without losing its ""whoness.""

I'm a life-long devoted fan of Doctor Who, and I'm only critical of the things I perceive as flaws, because I know just how good it can be.

Yes - I can see how structuring is important for a lot of television these days, but to a certain extent it's a new thing. Perhaps, as @Quazz and @jimmysilverrims suggest, it offers a stable framework upon which to build the ongoing story... but I guess it also reflects changing tastes and trends in television, as this is still a relatively new concept. Also, given the new 45-minute episode length I guess you need to provide a framework of sorts, in order to be able to jump straight into the action without wasting any time.

@Guitarism101 - you say you don't think Doctor Who would work well without the ""overarching story lines and grand finales"". Well I never said these were bad things, just that they were too often clumsily-written. the classic series was much subtler with its plot arcs (for example the Seventh Doctor's ongoing chess game against Fenric), and season finales could be just as epic, without the need to destroy the Earth each year, bring it back, then make everyone forget it happened (just look at the 'Key to Time', 'Guardian' or 'Trial of a Timelord' arcs). I personally think that it was far superior as a result... with a greater emphasis on story-telling and character development owing to the typical story length of 100 minutes, as well as far more varied plot structures for seasons.

Maybe though, the world is changing - the classic series did die out, after all. Perhaps new Doctor Who is the way the show needs to be these days, in order to exist at all. I certainly don't begrudge it that, and would rather that it existed in a modern style, than disappeared altogether - but having been a massive Doctor Who geek for well over two decades, I reserve the right to grumble about things... :)

Unless it has changed overnight, Northern Ireland **is** part of the UK. However my point was not of any influence or remit, but just one example of an MP being wholly inappropriate for the position he holds. It is one thing to be religious, it is quite another to *oppose* the theory of evolution and still hold the position of health minister, which requires understanding and acceptance of science. He is there as a puppet, no more no less. 

&gt;You're confusing the issue here

And what issue is that then? That MPs are not usually qualified for departmental or ministerial positions they hold. I think that is pretty clear. 

&gt;Most MPs have incredibly impressive CVs and overall bring a wide range of knowledge on the gamut of issues. They get to choose what debates to contribute to and what issues or questions to raise, so the issue of their expertise really is more anti-politician sentiment than reality.

Thank you for the advertisement. If you mean transferable skills, yes they have those, if you mean experience gleaned from political appointments then the point is moot. Some MP's do come from a professional background before entering the house, however few of them are put into a post where their professional experience is of use. 

&gt;My response would be that a minister doesn't really benefit from industry experience or even a directly relevant degree. First because it opens them up to allegations of cronyism (a constant political headache). Secondly, it prejudices their opinion and responses to legislation making the entire process rather truculent. But most importantly, any minister worth their salt will have spent a long process getting to know the system in which they operate, how to get what they need from civil servants and learn the intricacies of (albeit junior) ministerial control. This can be achieved through a long term shad-cab position or through lower level positions and is far more relevant to the job than 10 years working in finance. 

In terms of being a politician, that is spot on, that is what the job demands they do. However;-

&gt;Essentially what this boils down to is that it's ridiculous to describe ministers as being unqualified, as the only experience which is really necessary to govern is governing.

That comment sums up my point totally. They are more than qualified to be MPs, because that is all their job demands of them. You appear to be arguing that having a minister with no experience for the job is better, which I believe is a civil service pov.  You have still missed my point in that most of them lack the experience needed to appreciate and fully understand what their *specific* position entails.

true,SophieWho,tennant,Tennant,"The amazing thing about Doctor Who is that it is ever changing. ""Better"" is a matter of opinion. Going off of the existing Doctors shows how varied fan favorites can be. One person's least favorite Doctor is another person's favorite. 

The quality of the show will always vary episode to episode, Doctor to Doctor, showrunner to showrunner. 

Unlike most other shows where (generally speaking) you know who the cast is and will be for the full run of the show, companions come and go and eventually so will the current Doctor (and showrunner).

So say, just as an ~~fact~~ example, I didn't like Matt Smith **at all**. Or I didn't like Moffat's run at all. Or I didn't like Amy/Rory/River. *Or I hated the whole lot*. 

~~Which I do~~

For any other show, that would be the end. ""THIS ISN'T THE SHOW I FELL IN LOVE WITH! This is all wrong! ShowX is dead! DEAD! I QUIT!"" And I'd never watch it again. 

But with Doctor Who, I always know that change is around the corner. That something fresh and new is coming. The entire dynamic of the show will change when the new companions come. Even if I'm still unsatisfied, a new regeneration can't be too far behind, which will *radically* change the dynamic of the show. And, eventually, Moffat will go as well, and someone new will being an entirely different spin to the show. 

So ultimately **TL;DR**, will seven be better than six? Will eight be better than seven? That depends on who you ask. For me, the show did get better with each season, until season 5, at which point the trend reversed. But for others RTD's Who was unsatisfying, and Moffat/Smith was a huge upgrade for them. Neither of us are wrong. We just have different tastes.

Herion and crack in particular are the type of drugs I feel should be kept illegalised. These drugs are extremely damaging to individuals and society. 

I have always been off the opinion that nobody has the right to tell you what to put in your body and so here would be my proposed reform:

Individuals are not punished for possession of a control substance that they willing and freely injest using their body, for pleasure or addiction. Obviously this would be for a sensible amount for personal use.

Secondly I propose that cannabis is legalised, carefully regulated and sold. Or at the very least made available for medicinal purposes.  

Finally the dealers/smugglers (on the big time) of drugs are continued to be punished. This is a hard law for me to decide on. On one hand, speaking from a purely biased opinion, my local dealer is a friendly, approachable guy who I would never want to see locked up because he sells a bit of weed to pay for his disabled fathers up keep. I do want the cartels/gangs who ruin peoples lives while making a profit locked away however.

Yes, heroin. It is well know that pharmacologically it is less harmful than tobacco and alcohol and doesn't even outrank tobacco on it's addictivity. 

The harm from heroin comes from it's illegality, not it's pharmacology. 

Essentially the approach to drugs should be based on the effects upon society and the 10,000+ legally supplied heroin addicts (the *good* addicts who got *diamorphine* addictions whilst undergoing medical treatment) lead perfectly productive lives unlike the *bad* heroin addicts who are given maintenance doses of diamorphine - they are scum and a drain on our society.

Question is are the bad heroin addicts a drain because they are treated like crims and the good addicts not because they are treated like patients, or vice versa?

Edit: Just to make it clear - there are really bad drugs out there that have a deletorious effect on both the individual and society but since we allow Alcohol (one of the prime negative drugs) I'd say the argument against the others is somewhat weakened, pharmacologically and socially, wouldn't you?

true,d_r_benway,null,null,"The simple fact is there is absolutely no moral reason at all for jailing ANYONE for the possession or cultivation of cannabis - absolutely NONE.

Below are my main reasons for saying this:-

**Cost of keeping if prohibited :-**

I spend (over a year) £1000's on weed - NONE of that money goes to the government it goes to criminal gangs (or brave friends who grow it...). 

Another fact - I pay my own way in life - always have done (never claimed the dole), - if I were jailed for cannabis possession (unlikely but still possible 5 year sentence) , they all of you would have to pay for my food and upkeep in jail - is that fair (or benefiting society)

Flying helicopters to search of grow rooms, searching everybody at train stations, etc costs a lot of money (that could be spent elsewhere), and pisses off the general public - I wonder if cannabis were legalised how many more police jobs would be saved (from the forthcoming cuts) - helicopter fuel ain't cheap....  Legalise weed = save police jobs !

**Relations with police :-** 

Until weed is at least decriminalised I will just not talk to police if I can help it - I know many otherwise law abiding people who do the same - perhaps if cannabis were decriminalised the police would have better relations

Legal drugs (like alcohol) ruin society far more:-

Just go to any town/city on a saturday night and see what I mean - its very very rare to hear of a gang of stoners kicking the shit out of someone - if happened every single weekend with alcohol - how can this be morally correct ?

**Contamination / public health:-**

Since the UK government crackdown on growhouses in 2006 the UK has been flooded with contaminated weed. By contaminated I mean sprayed with a substance (silica, etc) to mimic the look of THC - this means that a drug that according to most evidence is next to not harmful becomes lethal... All because of prohibition....

At the time of this TV interview Cambodia had been occupied by the Vietnamese for almost a decade.

We were actually backing the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK). It was made up of Khmer Rouge, a Royalist faction and the Khmer People's National Liberation Front.

They were fighting against the Vietnamese occupation and their installed government. By this point Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge government had fled into the jungle and collapsed and were not in charge of the Khmer Rouge taking part in this coalition.

To be honest it's hard to point to the good or bad guys in this period after the Vietnamese invasion. The country's history is soaked in blood. Many people switched sides. The Vietnamese didn't invade for noble reasons of saving the Cambodians, they were getting fed up with Khmer Rouge attacks. Most of the Cambodians that the Vietnamese invaded with in 1979 were ex Khmer Rouge. It's one massive mess of self interest and self preservation.

Unfortunately the will of those in power in Cambodia to screw their fellow country men has not gone away. The current government is ridiculously corrupt.

I get the idea of unfair debt but then most national debt is over 30 years old so the people paying it are not the ones who took it out and had no say in it.

Also, the amount in question is stupidly tiny.  And (democratic) Argentina has the option of not paying if it does not want to.  Of course then it would have more trouble taking out loans in the future that were not repayable rapidly.  But then if they were not trying to lump the debt on their kids that should not be a problem should it...

Personally I am all for morality, I just don't see the point if it makes no difference.  If we had not sold them weapons, someone else would.  If we cancel their debts no one else will bother.

true,pepounos,null,null,"Firstly you have to looks at economics, while its painful for people to face more competition (lower wage) to find a job in economic term lowering the cost of work is a good thing: it tend to make the country more competitive and act as an incentive to invest/hire/spend more which turn into job creation.

Then you seem to think that the country is a more or less economic closed system, that job cannot be outsourced abroad and that a foreigner getting a job is always taking an existing job who belonged to a native. If you look into it, you will discover that it's much more complex than that, that the young immigrant is often pretty qualified (but ready to take an underqualified job) and that to live here is going to need to have a flat, eat, pay taxes, spend money and create value to be paid.

If the country don't get more competitive, the new jobs are simply created somewhere else (we live in a globalized world).

If you have a hard time finding a job in uk (or anywhere) they are three simple universal options to solve it:
-gain qualification, to increase your value on the job market (the value that you can produce for an employer).

-move where there is employment (south in the case of UK).

-lower your pay requirement.

Neither are the greatest examples, admittedly, but hopefully serve to illustrate that avoiding tax does not mean evading it. Reducing your tax exposure is perfectly normal thing to do.

The problem for me is that the spirit of the tax laws are being abused when the properly rich don't pay their share through perfectly legitimate means of avoidance. In my opinion, those legitimate means need to be tightened up such that people who have massive incomes cannot use the same means to avoid paying tax that people like you and I do (self-employed contract IT worker here), and some of the methods of avoiding tax through relief that are only available if you do have lots of money, need to be removed.

It is perfectly reasonable for a citizen to launch a two ton metal cage around the country at speeds of up to 70mph in spite of the real dangers posed. In order to ensure that every driver acts responsibly we issue each with a license which will be suspended and/or revoked in cases of abuse. 

We can accept that drug use is also a reasonable act which has the potential for societal harm and, now that we have the technological means at our disposal, we can resolve the problem through licensing. I would propose the introduction of a personal intoxication licence, required at the point of purchase of any drug (excluding tobacco), which would be suspended/revoked should the drug user engage in acts such as violence, anti-social behaviour, crime in aid of funding drugs, driving under the influence or distributing to minors/unlicensed adults. The licence would be issued at 18, however in cases where the young adult has been caught using underage or otherwise involved in crime the issuing could be deferred until 21 or such a time that the person demonstrates that they are responsible.

In time, as technology and policing advances, we could implement variable intoxicant duties that rise as the user purchases more in a given period of time. Eg. the 10 units of alcohol each week at a low duty, medium duty for 10-20 units etc. 

I would at first roll out such a licence for all low to mid harm intoxicants (alchohol, cannabis, MDMA, some tryptamines). I would review the remaining drugs after 10 years.

Clearly this would pose a number of logistical challenges and it would be hard to police the transfer of drugs post purchase. I do however feel that the model offers the best possible balance between the reasonable enjoyment of intoxicants and prevention of societal harm, while generating significant tax revenues from duties which could be redistributed towards treatment and education.

Take a look at the undignified Barca vs. Real and Man Utd vs. Liverpool back and forths, it's about as sophisticated as a doorknob

Then again, since the resentment and tribal mentality is so clear, I wouldn't bother looking for vindication of my opinions on there. Any neutral observer can tell you Lampard is a Premiership legend, not just a Chelsea hero. Any discussion of an all time Premiership XI must involve him, such is his staggering contribution. Dempsey on the other hand, is having his best season ever (still just average compared to Lampard's standards) while being American (a rarity) and playing for a team that very few people have negativity towards

If Lampard was an American playing for Fulham, there'd be infinitely more love for him

Unrelated, but a few threads about how much better Spanish teams are compared to English clubs and La Liga is better than the Premiership are always on the front page. I saw one of them and was going to chime in. I was going to bring up the following points....

1. TV revenue. Man Utd, as champions, earn 1.5x as much as the 20th placed team (£60m compared to £40m). Barca and Real take around £150m each while the lowest placed team take home around £10m

2. Football is cyclical. A time ago, Italian teams dominated with 3/4 of the Semi-Finalists. Then the English teams dominated for the past few years. This season, Spanish teams have done well, but it is only the first season, too early to celebrate a shift in European football power

There were a few other points, mainly about how Barca/Real have so much help from the league, government and banks. Barca needed a £150m emergency loan to pay players and bills, yet nobody batted an eyelid at their simultaneous £40m pursuit of Cesc. Real had huge bills and debts until the local government astonishingly decided to pay them £400m for their old training ground. English teams just couldn't pull stuff like that off. Also, they are 2 out of the 3 clubs shown the least number of cards in La Liga, if anybody's Real play they'd know how ridiculous that is

Anyway, I went off on a tangent there. My point was I had this detailed, accurate and sourced response written out and just decided not to bother. First Barca and Real fans would downvote without even reading it, then the rest of the La Liga fans would chime in saying ""LOL tell that to United, Bilbao are much better"". It's just an environment that doesn't lend itself to intelligent discussion and reasoned discourse, just a place where people can make fun of each other's teams and keep recycling the same old tired remarks",0,1334152898,null,0,false,0,c4ayowb,t3_s4769,t1_c4ayowb,t3_s4769,null,1435721974,10,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,10

It's not biting a person that's the problem - yes a lady who tried to help was bitten - but I understand that it wasn't serious, it was her hand and she is ok.
I don't think that Staffies are massively dangerous - as already mentioned in another comment, I used to have a staffie. She barked a lot, but otherwise was friendly, loveable and only a threat to rabbits (couldn't break her of that habbit no matter how hard I tried).
This staffie (not officially classified as a dangerous dog by law anyway) which was not being looked after properly, was under-exercised and then let out (probably by accident considering the owner's boyfriend did say that it was never let out) - it didn't bite, it literally destroyed another dog - completely unprovoked.

I would also hope (yes, it might be overly optimistic of me but still) that if the petition gets enough signatures to be discussed by parliament, that they would take into account that the current situation in NI doesn't work and make changes - including vetos on people from owning pets if they have been deemed unsuitable - that it would include a requirement for some sort of regular classes (even only an annual thing) - but in order to get any of that discussed, we have to convince them to discuss the issue at all. which is our main aim in getting behind this petition.

Yes, maybe I am being reactionary, and I don't actually want anyone else to suffer - not dog owners not the general public, but if this hadn't have happened, as someone who currently only owns cats &amp; fish (we haven't replaced Marley) then I probably wouldn't have given two hoots.

I admit that this makes me a lazy and possibly even a bad person - yes, I should care anyway, even though it wouldn't affect me in anyway, however, this is how most campaigners start - because something has happened which highlights an issue to them.

I would also like to address your point that checking the quality and condition of all new and existing dog owner is unfeasible... I know for certain that most rescue centres in the NW (the only area I have experience of this &amp; for cats as well as dogs) already do this for prospective adopters - so it is feasible - it'll just be a pain in the butt. However, I (and my friends and family) have been through the process already and it's substantially less painful than registering as a foster carer for children.
So, it's doable, it's done, it just needs to be done more widely.

No system is ever going to be perfect, and yes, I agreed before &amp; I'll agree again, fiscally, anything which involves spending money is going to be unpopular - but unfortunately, some things still need to be pushed for - and discussed at the very least - let's be honest, even if it is discussed, and ultimately something is put into place, it isn't likely to happen any time soon - it would take years to implement legislation.

&gt;  Is it good for us to have so many jobless people who taxpayers have to pay to support?

No one is debating that.

&gt; Also: You're basically advocating trickle-down economics here. ""Let's impoverish ourselves so we'll be more desperate which will attract businesses!"".

I am not, there is a middle ground between saying ""there is not point in improving competitiveness by lowering cost of labor"" and ""everyone should accept a chinese wage"". I stand in this middle ground ""we are competing with the chineses worker, we need to have that in mind when thinking about our cost of labour and find the best solution to mitigate the damage"".

&gt; But what about 'the knowledge economy', and what about making a more equitable society? How can kids learn well when they're in a packed primary school class with several students who can't speak English?

You are suggesting the same thing as i did, investing into education (i said it ""gain qualification, to increase your value on the job market "").

&gt; How can people eventually earn enough money to strike out on their own and make the next eBay, if they never make enough money or have enough free time?

You might be disappointed in this but the ability to make the next ebay comes from innovation (very linked to education/skill of workforce) and ability to attract investment (very linked to competitiveness) not on free time and individual savings.

&gt; If a foreigner comes to the UK to work, they will almost always be taking a job that would otherwise have gone to a UK native.

No, this is not the way the economy work.

&gt; Jobs can be outsourced abroad, but also this isn't something that has to happen. 

This is something that is naturally happening in a globalized world, and i am affraid that there is not much to be done against it (other than find way to increase competitiveness).

&gt; That the immigrant has to take a job he's overqualified for, indicates to me that we don't need more immigrants with those qualifications.

Again there is not a fixed and limited number of job, the presence of your foreigner creating value/spending/paying tax is creating new job. And him being overqualified is an ability to later on evolve and create more value. The more qualified are the people entering the country, the more value they can create in the country economical system (value that everyone tend to benefit from).

&gt; The large South Korean companies

You might want to look at the kind of product that those company produce and the skill of their workforce... thats why they are protected.

&gt; He's taking housing too

No he is supporting the demand and creation of housing, which is very important for the economy (lot of people working there, lot of use of credit).

&gt; The money he spends is that which the UK native would have spent

Again this is not a closed system.

&gt; We are not going to be able to compete with China on cost any time soon. We probably should have restricted outsourcing.

That's the intuitive reaction, but it does not work that way, outsourcing is used by british company to lower their cost, stay competitive and keep selling product. When you see someone lose his job because a big uk company decided to outsource some of his job, you need to realize that the money saved by the company will allow to generate more sales, and invest more and innovate more and create more job. Basically: 1 job lost does not mean than 1 job is really lost :)

&gt; I have done all of these things. Many people have done these things. 

And everyone will have to keep doing those things, there is no way to avoid that.

&gt; Do you realise that almost everyone does not want to 'lower their pay requirements'

Yes i do.

&gt; that that would be considered a negative consequence of immigration?

That is the result of a bad analysis, on a global scale immigration allow economy to be more competitive which over the long term allow everyone to get paid better.

Cliffs: economy is a counter intuitive science and goes against ""common sense"". British economy is not a closed system, the amount of job available is not fixed, reducing the cost of work today will allow everyone to be paid more tomorrow. Young skilled immigration is in reality helping to the creation of value/job and as a consequence employment of locals.

&gt;that just confirms that my original point was justified.

That wasn't your point, your point was that the media goes crazy about snow but that the population does not go crazy over snow.

My response was that quite verifiably at least a proportion of the population does in fact react quite strongly to the presence of snow, as evidenced by the fact that beyond the media stir created, schools and offices close. I did this because you were disputing my point and obviously while I was not making a claim that 100% of the population over-react, I was making a claim that some of them do. Your disagreement required me to show that &gt; 0 % of the population do over-react, so instead of stretching and affording you room to dispute portions of my claim, I reduced it to the point whereby it still negates your argument and also still carries the intended meaning of my claim, without being disputable. Hence I showed that ""some"" percent (other than 0% or 100%) go crazy when there is snow.

That's right, they're not leeching. But then children don't emigrate, they get taken along.

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"I'd pretty much agree with Acheson on this but it's not an entirely straight forward issue owing to a few peculiarities unique to Britain. On the face of it we are now pretty much a middle ranking state on a lot of indicators. For example we are no longer world leaders in any particular field except finance (and that hasn't been working out great of late), our military - although potent - is entirely dependent on the US/NATO for anything other than very low level overseas operations and there certainly doesn't seem to be any great clamour to return to the days when most of the globe was pink.

However there are some other factors that make us a little odd:

1. We still have a nuclear deterent which is very unusal for country of our size (Isreal being the only place that's both smaller and nuclear) and with that comes a place on the UN Security Council. I personally think we shouldn't really be entitled to such a position (and nor should we really carry on with deterence.... it's a great deal of cost for something that's ultimately apalling) but it does give us a unique amount of clout for our diminutive size.

2. Having one foot in the Anglosphere and the EU is both an advantage and a disadvantage as it gives us a great many options but also serves to ensure that we are never true leaders in either realm.

3. The Commonwealth still probably counts for more than we give it credit for. I've travelled a lot overseas and you tend to find that there is still some genuine affection out there for 'Mother England' in some of the former colonies. This of course will continue to wane in time but it ain't over yet.

So yes, I'd say we're pretty much a middle ranking nation with a few perks who still haven't quite adjusted to a world where we don't call the shots. I'd personally like to see us just take reality on the chin and stop tearassing around like global policemen as that is really no longer our role and I'd also be pleased if we started thinking a little more outside the US/NATO/EU box.

That's South West. South has lots of nice rides, including Burrington Combe and Blagdon Lake. Chew Valley lake is the same direction.

Up north there are plenty of nice areas up Thornbury way (not that I'm biased) - Olbury, Tockington or Rockhampton and even up to Berkeley and the deer park in between - and the Severn Bridge leading to Chepstow isn't so far. The only issue with that direction is having to get through the suburbs first.

You are perfectly free to run an ADSL or equivalent line to your rural office for those essential VPNs if you need such services - it's part of the cost of doing business. If you want it badly enough, someone will find a way of providing it to you.

What you are arguing for is not to cure a lack of service, but to make the service affordable, which is a totally different argument.

That's utterly preposterous and an affront to common sense.  If that were me I wouldn't have been able to hold my head up.  I'd be able to call myself non-dom and British and feel like I've made no compromise to my Britishness - but to hold office?  That takes a really inflated sense of self-worth (but then again I get that impression with most politicians.  The chutzpah many of them must have when they decide they're fit for office, especially the career politicians).

&gt;they are living in this country and only paying VAT/council tax etc. which seems a bit strange - it's a complicated issue I suppose.

It is, but it doesn't need to be though, at least not to the same extent.  An extra added luxury VAT rate on certain items.  Nobody who can afford a £250k Ferrari is not going to buy it because it would now cost them £275k that a VAT hike might include.  If you can't spare the £25k  you're not in the market for a quarter of a million pound car.  If you're a non-dom buying a secondary or tertiary luxury home you can take an extra 15% burn.  If it's just a flat or a bolt hole, fair enough, but if it is the sort of home that already demands an extra 4 to 5% stamp duty you can afford an extra 10-15%.  They can still come here for the best corporation rates and some of the best infrastructure/networking/working culture of the big EU countries.  There's plenty of ways around making them contribute in real terms.

&gt;It is interesting how harsh the USA is though.

In my opinion, Chelsea isn't like other clubs, for good or for ill. Because of the revolving door that is the manager's position, people like John Terry hold a lot of sway within the dressing room, and I have no issue with that so long as we recognise that throwing a dominant personality into the club and telling them to ""Win titles and tell the old guard players who's boss"" isn't going to work, as proved by AVB.

It's all about distance and density. If you live too far from the exchange, your only solution is 5ghz point-to-point radio, single-mode fibre duct to the home or satellite (which isn't fast enough really). All these solutions are very expensive. To dig a trench for fibre will set you back a few grand per km depending on terrain. A radio is less, but so is the link capacity. Fortunately, the number of houses that are *that* far our are quite few, so we can scratch them off the list (in the same way the number of people in the countryside is a lot less than the city).

The next problem is density. If your local exchange has 200 homes within 10km, then you've got to try and spread the cost of the backhaul MPLS equipment, the SDH metro fibre ring to the city, the MSAN/DSLAM, the cable jumpering and the contractor costs between those people. It's a fucking load of money that will never be recovered.

Leave a terrace clear and allow family members to leave memorials to their loved ones on the seats, (the seats which have been installed as a result of the disaster - an improvement of safety and one positive outcome of the tragedy)? Or perhaps auction the match ball or shirts or something and donate the funds to the Hillsborough Justice Campaign? Just saying ""Nope, we aren't playing that day"" is the most passive thing they could choose to do and it just feels like they are emotionally defeated somehow. Of course the disaster was a tragic one, but after all these years perhaps it isn't unreasonable to hope that the day could be marked in a more positive and forward-looking way?

I wasn't alive at the time of the disaster and I haven't yet lost a close family member so perhaps I am unable to understand the emotion surrounding the day.

Things to bear in mind:

1)It goes counter clockwise. Yours reads Watch Who Doctor.

2)The word ""Doctor"" is sort of pushing into the two others adding the characters Ts. For some people, this could cause confusion.

3)In ""Who"", that is not a H. That's a P.

4)""Doctor"" is rotated wrong. For example, it says now ""ktordo"" rather than ""doktor"". It starts from the bottom and goes round counter-clockwise too.

Not everyone feels there wasn't any closure. (And honestly, try being a fan of McGann, McCoy, or Colin Baker and wanting closure. Please. Get real.) David Tennant chose to move on. I think seeing him in a multi-Doctor special alongside Smith, McGann, (and please, Dear G-d, Eccleston no matter how improbable it is) would be great. However I would probably throw something at the monitor if he got another season as the Doctor. Likewise, I think a multi-Doctor movie would be fine, but not a movie with him solo. If he's desperate to come back, and enough people want it so much, maybe there's room for another spin-off following the adventures of Rose and the metacrisis Doctor in Pete's world.

here's my issue.

In my opinion and from a political perspective, that place is as an independent nation - with it's own currency aka not a member of a single European currency or whatever the forerunner of the new Euro. I'd maybe even go further and withdraw from the EU entirely; from any perspective, non EU members in Europe e.g Switzerland, Norway etc appear to be doing rather well.

Aside from politics and focusing on the economy we need to focus on our key industries and as unpopular as it is right now, that means finance. We have limited geographical scope and a highly educated, service economy. Add into this the sheer profitability of finance over a long period and you understand it would be foolish to not double down on this.

true,[deleted],null,null,"But of course, the UK designs and engineers all sorts of specialist things. We've been investing in education and churning the population through the education system since New Labour and look at the state of things - there are no prospects for people who are ""normal"", so to speak. Unskilled labour - that is, work that doesn't require a degree - just doesn't exist, or is too low paid to be taken seriously when it used to be. Even the people who do get degrees have trouble finding any way of contributing something to the country.

Granted, we don't have coal mines or anything of that sort, but my point is that we could do even if it's entirely artificial. The problem is that it's not acceptable to be ""just normal"" and that we are all expected to be engineers, scientists, technologists, entrepreneurs and so on and so on. The truth is that only a minority of people are like that and specialist technology is rarely ordered en-masse, so you don't need as many people to build them. Try applying for a job at sixteen inserting rivets into steel at BAE - nope, you need 9,999 qualifications and you get a salary that looks like a punchline to a crap joke.

If the government used political control to actively boost economic output like China does (not just through public-private partnerships or nuggets of money given to business on the promise that they'll employ x amount of people), then we wouldn't have this division. A crazy idea: put a tax on imported finished goods (but not, say, one-off or specialist machinery). I mean a massive tax, so high that no business in their right mind would consider continuing offshore manufacturing - but take all import quotas and taxes away on *component parts* - a manufacturing boom should follow. You could give tax breaks to companies that manufacture here to make up for the difference in minimum wage. That'd ultimately boost the true economic output whilst providing millions of simply ordinary people with a life beyond living in their parent's house. I don't disagree with you when you say that there is no value in making toothbrushes, but there's a huge chunk of the population that aren't interested in education or can't afford to get into debt and those people need to be given the same chances at a proper life just as much as any systems engineer.",0,1334176214,null,0,false,0,c4b3veo,t3_s4erx,t1_c4b3veo,t1_c4b2q0x,null,1428701108,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

No, you've just changed the semantics ... that support user with their own account and their own password that can ""attached themselves to the users account so they can experience things as if the user did it themselves"" is exactly the SAME thing as a master password.

It is reducing the complexity of the system to a single login / password that can access all other accounts data. Thus it is inherently less secure than using the individual password attached to a specific account.

&gt; That means that if the Russian hackers ever hack the system, they still can't see what the user passwords are and the users will then not be at risk with sites where they used the same passwords.

But they still have access to all your data stored on that specific server, and if we've learned anything from the Sony debacle, that includes a shit-load of credit card numbers and other personally identifying information.

And it could be argued that anyone who uses the same login / password for multiple services is just asking for trouble anyway.",0,1334178157,null,0,false,0,c4b4c3i,t3_s48z0,t1_c4b4c3i,t1_c4b485i,null,1428701388,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It's a trend, but it's not one you can use to predict the quality of future DW episodes.

Someone gullible enough to give their password to a random stranger who'd called them couldn't *possibly* be tricked by a crafted email linking to a dummy site at virginmed1a.myhomepage.nifty.ru, or tricked into installing the VirginFasterInternet.exe

It's a fine trade-off between usability of a system for the majority of users who never need technical support and are ever in this situation, and protecting the kind of people who would forget their head if it wasn't screwed on, and probably click ""NO"" every time their virus checker wants to auto update because ""it slows down Facebook"".

The more you idiot-proof a system, the dumber the idiots become. Fact of life. At some point, cost effectiveness comes into play, and you have to say ""that'll do pig, that'll do"".

Personally, I feel that when you are managing a server with perhaps thousands or even millions of user accounts, potentially exposing all those accounts en-masse because of some ill-thought-out ""this is more secure master access control system"" is infinitely worse.

While you have a responsibility to each individual user, you also have a responsibility to ALL your users. You are trying to overcompensate on an individual account basis by leaving a great gaping whole that if exploited, could compromise your entire user base in seconds - either by external hackery or internal jiggery pokery.

His fellow MEPs don't think he's a madman so much as encourage the view of him as a madman because he does not share the comfortable and increasingly undemocratic consensus of a European superstate.

The idea that he's not being heard is ridiculous. It's just that many people in the media and political mainstream aren't keen to listen.

Farage is not regarded as a fringe lunatic, but people who disagree with him are happy to perpetuate that image. And it is an image that is largely derived from the fact that UKIP *does* contain a good number of fringe lunatics.

It will be interesting to see if UKIP can ever escape that core membership of lunatics to become a credible UK party, but the problem isn't Farage - it's the party membership and the generally pro-European/anti-UKIP agenda of the media and political mainstream (case in point, apparently the UKIP candidate for London Mayor was polling well ahead of the Green Party candidate, yet the former was excluded from the BBC Newsnight mayoral debate and the latter included).

* ""Redeploy billions of saved EU money to Scotland and her people"" (Scotland has received several billion pounds from the EU's Structural Grant)
* ""Resign from the EU while keeping free trade with it"" (why would the EU allow free trade with a non-EU member?)
* ""Restrict immigration so Scotland will be for the Scots and the British first"" (six of my friends are married to partners from Ireland, Austria, America (x3), and Thailand - their children are Scottish, and more than welcome)
* ""Repeal the European Human Rights Act"" (which prohibits torture, slavery, and executions)
* ""Repeal the Climate Change Scotland Act, which is pointlessly wrecking our world-famous landscape with wastefully-subsidised, useless, bird-killing wind-farms."" (Er, okay)
* ""End all subsidies to monstrous, climate-irrelevant, cost-ineffective wind-farms."" (Okaay)
* ""Owners of existing wind-farms rejected by planning committees will pull them down at their own expense."" (Okaaay)
* ""Spend no taxpayers’ money on the non-problem of man made climate change"" (really?)
* ""Support new nuclear power stations"" (no thanks)
* ""Boot camps to jolt young offenders out of a life of crime"" (with some actual evidence, or '40s nostalgia?)
* ""Introducing directly-elected Police Boards"" (thus creating American-style District Attorney corruption?)
* ""Scrap the smoking ban as a needless restriction on freedom"" (I don't think I've met a single person who wants to go back to smokey pubs/restaurants)
* ""Ensure that any woodland planted to alien monocultures by the Forestry Commission is privatised"" (I presume they mean Sitka, which means privatising about 70% of the FC's plantations)
* ""Abolish costly, useless Home Reports for property sellers in Scotland"" (they're actually very useful)
* ""Scrap over-regulation of abattoirs"" (who needs health &amp; safety when it comes to animal welfare or human food?)
* ""Make carriageway doubling on the A9 from Perth to Inverness a priority"" (wait, what? That actually makes sense!)
* ""Remove all speed cameras throughout Scotland"" (seriously?)

With my system former employees no longer have access to the system as their personal user account would be disabled and any leak of login information would be directly traceable back to the person who sold it. When you put user passwords in every mundane customer service email, you lose track of who might have had access to it to sell it.

That person cannot just casually browse user data, they have to enable that through a central internal system that is only on their local network. When they switch into accounts, it is logged.

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"&gt; Even if the server is rooted then fine, the passwords are SHA512 hashes, they won't be able to crack them.

Assuming the important data isn't on the server they just rooted. You seem to be treating the ability to use the password itself (by chance) on some other server as more important than the potential data loss on the server that has just been compromised.

At what point does the responsibility to secure your own server become second to trying to protect users from their own stupidity by using the same password on multiple servers (completely unrelated to you) ?

&gt; You're much better off exploiting customers in a system where them handing over passwords is the norm by calling or emailing them asking for 'verification'.

If you've called them, I think it's a reasonable expectation that you will be asked for your password (or indeed any other method of verification), for you to prove who you are to them. Otherwise, anyone can call up claiming to be anyone else, and take actions on the account (via customer service) with no verification whatsoever.

If someone calls you out of the blue, asking for your personal details, you'd be an absolute fool to hand them over. Common sense.

&gt; you make it easy to implement a culture where customers do not expect you to ask them to hand over passwords

Which simply means you have to use some other method for both parties to verify their identity, a task which is just as problematic, and often just as badly implemented.

Other arguments for legalisation are 

1.Save money because of lower prison populations/less police needed to enforce the laws.
 
2.Make money on taxing the product and in the current economic climate this is a very good thing.  

3.Its safer when legal because you can control what's in it and people can get it from safer sources its also easier to educate people like on cigarette packets. 

4.Stops the money made from selling funding crime not just in the UK but  worldwide (look at mexico).

The police caused it and have never apologised for it. It's an open wound.

At this time as well, when Football was really starting to  bring in major money, it was all alot of nothern towns had. Football was a way of life that was brought through families. So it's a mixture of a community mourning, a social history event, an open wound that has never truly healed and an anger at being branded criminals.

It's also true that we don't have that many natural resources, but that's why I suggest removing taxes and quotas on components so we could import them freely - it was one of the reasons that the Raspberry Pi wasn't manufactured in the UK. Even though we're a small island nation, we have a large population and high unemployment rates, so there's an immediate workforce. With employment comes security and self-respect - look at the riots last year to see what boredom and unemployment does to normal people. Would they have happened if unemployment wasn't an issue? Probably, it started with anger towards the police over a shooting - but the extent of violence and carelessness exhibited following those protests would have been far less than we saw. I think the UK needs to offer that image of dignity through social mobility instead of ""don't worry, we're not going to tax you as much as the other party will!"" and the idea that you're only allowed your independence once you've gone to university and earning over £23k.

Constructing council houses and removing the right to buy would be a good idea to bring down unemployment temporarily. It'd stop social housing from being an investment opportunity instead of being a way for people on low incomes to access affordable housing.

But other than that we're currently limiting unskilled labour to agricultural work - which is a pretty dire industry at the best of times - and the army. Apprenticeships are a way out of that, but they aren't nearly as well promoted as university education.

&gt;For cannabis smokers to be taken seriously they should acknowledge that the drug can be dangerous. There is pretty strong evidence to suggest that cannabis use can be linked to depression and anxiety, and there is also a suggested link between cannabis and more serious mental illnesses (although whether the link is casual or not is unclear). As well as this, even if addiction is not generally physical, psychogical addiction is very real. Anyone who doesn't believe this can happily speak to several friends of mine.

&gt;Just to be clear, I'm not anti-cannabis and in fact have gone through phases of smoking it very regularly. I just find that many of these legalisation movements are pretty bias, and often act as if cannabis is this holy herb which is harmless because it's 'impossible to overdose or die from it'.
Personally, even as someone who smokes, I'm not exactly for legalisation. Use did rise when it was downgraded to a class C drug, and considering our country has a fairly big drug culture already, I can't imagine legalisation would help.

I'm not sure about Townsend tbh. I think he's definitely talented but just seems incredibly raw and selfish. He's a frustrating player to watch.

Carroll I'm also mixed on. His loan at Derby has been pretty disastrous from what I've gathered, but then again the Championship is a clusterfuck with no space and lots of street thugs in midfield. If anything it may have toughened him up a bit. The consensus on Derby forums was a deafening chorus of ""he's too lightweight"" but with the caveat that he was very intelligent and always wanted to be on the ball. 

He could end up being a player that really flourishes in the Premier League in spite of struggling in the Championship. After all, he played very well for us in Europa League. I have faith in the kid personally, he's got a good brain and if he bulks up a little I think he can be special. He's the same height as Luka but I bet he weighs like 30 pounds less at least.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Agreed on all counts. Like I said, with Townsend the talent is there. The raw physical ability is absolutely there, he just needs to work on his attitude. He's ended loan spells early with Leeds, Watford, and Ipswich less than 2 months in, with the Leeds loan ending because he wasn't happy, despite getting some playing time. I'm glad he's doing well at Birmingham right now, but he does need to get his head down and work when things aren't going his way, instead of taking the easy way out. Imagine if Bale grew unhappy and looked for a quick exit when he went through that torrid spell of 20-some games without a win.

As for Carroll, pretty much agreed on all counts. He's a child playing a man's game physically, but you could tell that mentally he's much much better than he was given credit for. I loved his playing in the Europa League and if he can bulk up a bit in the offseason (really wouldn't be that difficult, especially for a 19-year-old) and deal with the physicality, he can grow by leaps and bounds. Unfortunate that the Derby loan hasn't worked out, but I think we threw him into the deep end after some of his promising performances. He's the opposite of Townsend in that regards, imo, while Townsend has all the physical tools he needs to succeed, he's not quite there mentally while Carroll is showing signs of being a very composed and intelligent player, but isn't physical enough. In any case, it's refreshing to see a young English player that relies more on technique and composure on the ball than on raw physicality, but that's not to say he should shirk that side of the game.

They always seem to blame others for their tragedies, Heysel was caused by Chelsea fans, Hillsborough was caused by the police and the stadium, Michael Shields was innocent, Luis Suarez was not a racist and should not have been banned despite calling a black man a negro on a British football pitch. 

You say there is something missing in the moral standards of Liverpool people, never accept responsibility for your actions and blame other people, pass the guilt, don't grass on your own. 

These attitudes are morally reprehensible. 

Liverpool fans on the day surged on the gates outside the ground en-masse, they ran through the tunnels in the Leppings Lane en-masse and it was their actions that caused this accident, and it would be nice after 23 years if the club admitted as much.

It was common practice among their supporters at the time to ""jib-in"" without paying, and some Liverpool supporters admitted as much at Heysel. One year later there was a similar crush outside the gates at Hillsborough leading to many non-paying fans getting in for free, Two years later Hillsborough occurred.

Liverpool fans actually spent 30 years mocking Manchester United's plane crash at Munich.

They never accept guilt it is always someone elses fault, they carry a victim mentality, are deceitful about their own actions and expect 
everyone else to feel sorry for them and bend over backwards for them. 

I think some issues should be tackled and the attitudes in Liverpool should be raised or nothing ever changes.

The truth is that with weed the majority of people could smoke weed along roughly the same consumption patterns as they consume alcohol and it wouldn't cause any problems. But this doesn't mean it's harmless, just like alcohol it is possible to fall into substance abuse patterns with weed, and there are a small number of people for whom smoking weed will aggravate some genetic quirk or mental health issue.

I see no reason to stop using this analogy because it seems to me a perfectly valid one. Cars (and many other things) are lethal; cannabis is not.

The argument commonly used against cannabis by those who wish to stop its legalisation is that it is a dangerous drug. I contend that it is not; that it is in fact one of the safest drugs we know. Paracetamol and aspirin in fact - in terms of annual deaths from their use - are far more dangerous.

I am not actually advocating banning cars, just as you are not advocating banning cannabis - but I think the comparison is relevant when the discussion is framed in terms of public danger.

You are entitled to your view that my argument might alienate those who might otherwise be sympathetic to legalisation, but I disagree with this. My view is that it's both informative and helpful to make a direct and stark comparison with a daily recognised risk that everyone is already familiar with.

It wasnt just the police that were at fault but their own supporters and they employed the same tactic that worked the year before to jib in to the ground.

It was a common practice at Liverpool FC to get in without paying and at Wembley at the final they were doing the same. 

The club has never accepted its fans very clear role in this disaster, it has never once said well yes the police were responsible for health and safety but it was our fans which caused this with their own behaviour. 

I have followed this extremely closely, those people pushing through the gates and running down the leppings lane stand must share their responsibility of the blame they never have. They never will, because the Liverpool psyche is to never grass on your own and never accept responsibility.

true,whersmacheese,tardis,TARDIS,"When someone posted on reddit that they were filming in central park I was sort of skeptical but I thought what the hell and I booked it there. FOUND THEM. Awkwardly followed with a horde of people. 

When they stopped for lunch, I though they might like some tea (they were sitting outside and it was quite chilly today) and so I ordered some tea and asked that it be sent back to ""Matt, Karen, and Arthur"". When they got the tea Matt sort of motioned to me and asked if I sent it over and I just sort of nodded and smiled. Then the lady that I had ordered the tea from came around and said they wanted to talk to me. 

So I went over to talk to them and it's all kind of fuzzy from then on...I think I said ""I hope you're enjoying your tea!"" Arthur held out his hand and I shook his and Karen's hands (I think i was too star struck by Matt Smith to even think to shake his hand). Matt was so sweet, and he said, in his enthusiastic way, ""thanks for the tea!"" And I said ""thanks for doing what you do"". Then I asked for a picture and they kinda gave me 'meh' faces but I said ""I didn't do it for the picture but I couldn't forgive myself if I didn't get one"" and one of the guys who was working on the set said, ""oookay, but then they have to get back to work"". He took the picture, I think I thanked them again and said goodbye. And that's Everything!

Oh and I should probably add that my phone (the one the picture was taken with) died about five minutes later.

There was one who had been sad and alone for a short time, but was still ready to be saved, and then there was one who had been angry and alone for 36 years, and was too selfish to even save herself. What could the Doctor have done to help in that situation?

Day of the Moon: Your argument is like saying that when a man encourages slaves to revolt against their masters (which is what that was, the Silents had been using them for millennia), he's simply turning them into bloodthirsty killers, and for no good reason. The Silents were there to take advantage of the Earth population, and the Doctor stopped them by giving Earth the advice of the Silents. What else could he have done? Think of a better solution, one where Earth is freed and the Silents are pacified. Either way, some do survive, as you see one in Utah in The Impossible Astronaut.

Victory of the Daleks: Again, the Daleks are there to do what? End World War II? No, they're there to restart their race. The Daleks are ""everything he stands against."" Are you complaining that he threw a temper tantrum? What should he have done, killed them all? That doesn't seem like it'd be consistent with your arguments, so what's wrong with being mad that a Dalek is trying to trick Earth?

I don't think that either of them are real jerks, they're just prone to tantrums, like the 10th doctor yelling when Wilf is going to die, because he thought he'd escaped death.

The media also didn't really help the situation, constantly bringing up the whole Gerrard vs. Lampard thing. So then you get a lot of Liverpool fans disliking Lampard too.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; but if I have to pay for your drug rehabilitation process rather than cancer care than I will want to look at restricting your freedom to abuse drugs and thus incur those costs.

[According to the department of health](http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/cigarette_tax_receipts_v_cost_of), the cost to the NHS of treating smokers is around £1.7 billion a year.  Meanwhile, [HMRC reports](http://www.the-tma.org.uk/tma-publications-research/facts-figures/tax-revenue-from-tobacco/) that the total tax revenue from tobacco is £11.1 billion.

So I think it's fair to say that smokers are already paying for their treatment many times over.  

If those drugs that are currently illegal were made legal and taxed then that money could be used to support the NHS in treating the effects of drugs abuse.  At present, we're paying to treat them anyway, but getting no revenue in taxes.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"Tosh.  It's estimated at 2-5% of people who are likely to be susceptible to cannabis psychosis due to genetic factors.

If you want to know the real impact of cannabis on mental health then you need to look at the long term, large scale trends. 

Since the early 1970s there has been a significant increase in cannabis use.  It is estimated that more than four times as much cannabis is smoked now in the general population (Hickman et al, 2007).  Among under 18s, there has been an **eighteen-fold** increase in consumption over that same time.  If you believe the tabloid fear-mongering, cannabis is now much stronger and more dangerous than it was back then.  So if it's that dangerous and so many more people are doing it, then more people should be going ""mad"", right?  Wrong!

The overall rates of psychosis and schizophrenia have stayed constant or even declined slightly over that same time.

Source: Frisher, M et al, Assessing the impact of cannabis use on trends in diagnosed schizophrenia in the United Kingdom from 1996 to 2005, Frisher et al, Journal of Schizophrenia Research 2009, doi:10.1016/j.scchres.2009.05.031.

People get mentally ill all the time due to a wide range of different causes.  For example, a bloke I was at uni with didn't drink, didn't smoke, but had a psychotic episode trigger by excessive caffeine consumption.  But that doesn't mean that coffee makes you go mad.  One swallow does not a summer make.

It's the only way we can regain control over the supply of drugs.  Making them illegal doesn't stop people from taking them - it just puts the entire supply chain in the hands of people who care only about profit and not about the consequences.

These days it's easier for teenagers to get cannabis than it is for them to get alcohol or tobacco.  That's because we have some level of control over the alcohol and tobacco ""dealers"" and very little over the playground purveyors of puff.

It would not be without its problems, of course.  There would almost certainly be a short term increase in drug use, drug tourism and all sorts of opposition from tabloids, concerned parents and NIMBYs who would rather it was going on in their back yard without them having to openly acknowledge it.  It would probably take 5 to 10 years for us to get over the hump and start to see a long-term sustainable reduction in the prevalence of drug use, and more importantly, the harm caused by drug abuse.  In that time, we will have made a lot of money in taxation and taken a huge amount of money out of the hands of organised criminals.

But... I doubt it will ever happen because politicians don't want to be seen to be ""sending out the wrong message"".  In politics it's more important to say the right thing than to do the right thing.

HA! Sorry but that's bloody hilarious, what have *you* been smoking? 

I've been smoking weed for nearly a decade and 1) It isn't controlled, at all, by the government unless you're caught smoking it in public. And then it isn't the substance that's controlled, but the citizen. That's what prohibition **is**, the government takes no responsibility for the drugs trade, hands it over to the criminals, and than attempts to clean up the mess left behind by those criminals by arresting citizens who did nothing except for wanting to get buzzed (like we ALL do with alcohol, or coffee).

Why should it be controlled anyway? I feel I have a right to enjoy cannabis. It's safer than alcohol and I prefer it; it doesn't make me hungover, nor does it turn me into a drunken prick.

2). Alcohol *is* controlled with product regulations, sales regulations, tax, education, and an age limit. Yes having alcohol comes at a great cost to our society but nowhere near as a high a cost as prohibiting alcohol would (like they did in Finland and America in the 1920's). If we regulated cannabis like alcohol then we would see less young people smoking it all the time (age limit) and we'd have proper product regulation (no more hash cut with plastic or mud).

&gt;How would you go about protecting the mentally ill who are now informed that cannabis is okay to smoke, how would we pay for the extra costs on the health service?

We don't inform them that it's ""okay to smoke"" in the first place. Legalisation does not equal condonement. We pay the same costs we pa now for the millions of cannabis smokers in the U.K. *which is not very much because the health consequences are completely blown out of proportion.

Nope, it should be legalised (decriminalisation doesn't work very well) and cannabis can help with many ailments, so they would be dealing with ""genuine people"".

ADDRESS 
  OF 
BANK

Dear Sir or Madam,

 

Re: Account number: XXXXXXXXXXXXX

 

I am writing in relation to the above payment protection (PPI) policy which I believe was mis-sold to me.

 

I believe you have not treated me fairly for the following reason;

 

·         The PPI was added without my knowledge.

 

Unless you can prove that the policy was fair and reasonable and that I was treated fairly when I was sold the insurance, I demand a full refund of all premiums, and subsequent interest on these payments, that I have paid in relation to this policy. I also expect 8% interest to be added to each payment I have made as this is the statutory amount a court would pay.

 

 

I look forward to your full and prompt response to this letter in accordance with the FSA regulation. If this matter is not settled within eight weeks of this letter I shall be contacting the Financial Ombudsman to investigate my complaint.

 

Yours faithfully,

true,eastlondonmandem,english,INGERLAND,"Right and that's the point, it's NOT cannabis that is the fault, it's HUMAN NATURE. People want to enjoy stuff. Some people rack up huge credit card bills on spending sprees, some people drive recklessly fast for enjoyment, some people do extreme sports and break bones, some people eat themselves to death.

If you are gonna keep cannabis illegal then so should all forms of harm, in which case what is the point in living?

&gt;My point is that if he wasn't so hooked on a life centred around a mind numbing depressant which literally seems to crush all wit and spark out of a person such as him, then he would have gone on to better things.

Who's to say? People make their own paths in life, you cannot say one way or another what would have happened without cannabis, they might have had an addictive/excessive personality and could have gone onto other things that might have ""ruined"" their life. These drugs are freely available in many circles, you aren't proposing anything that would change this. I know people seemingly ""addicted"" to ketamine which just means they enjoy it so much and they can't control their usage, it's not ketamine itself.

I myself know someone who stopped smoking due to paranoia and some other mental issues, he stopped because he noticed what was going on and he decided smoking cannabis was not for him. Another friend smoked for 10 years and one day just decided he had enough and just stopped.

The point is, it's personal choice, and you need to get away from the fact that many of these drugs are not actually physically addictive. Saying ""psychologically addictive"" is complete bollocks because that can happen with almost anything, there are people in huge debt because they can't control their spending.

The current model requires a developer to build a block of nice houses, and a block of less nice housing - which puts the entire cost of the subsidy on the (few) new home owners, rather than spreading it out across society through general taxation.

It was in part the surge in cost of new builds caused by this location-specific subsidy that drove house prices in general upwards to sky-high levels over the past decade.

I live in a new build with concierge and rules of conduct, and next to us is the social housing block, which to be blunt about it is inhabited by people who don't understand how to live politely in a high-density environment.

Now, if the two blocks were under one management, and everyone was mixed in a bit, we could have codes of conduct for all residents, and everyone would be living comfortably together.

However, the current model - based on one block for sale and a separate block for subsidy can't permit social integration in that manner.

How can you sympathize with the Doctor, who had been hiding in the TARDIS like a coward and sending Rory out as a proxy (he has a host of safety suits and knows that it'll be pretty dangerous for Rory out there), but not Amy who had been struggling to survive for thirty-six years and was now expected to just be okay with being snuffed out of existence in favor of her younger self.

After thirty-six years of needlessly suffering to survive, I'd want them to *live* with the consequences of their mistakes rather than just trying to make me go away. I'm not going to just quietly blink out of existence like all those years didn't happen.

The Doctor could have done what he said he was going to, or not lie at all. But instead he did lie and decided to stab Old Amy in the back like an asshole.

The Silents had encouraged humanity to advance into space. The Doctor has no idea why they're doing this, for all he knows they could be helping us. Hell, if he's okay with a cuckoo alien-child infiltrating Earth and messing with people's memories or with most of the planet's bees actually being aliens why does he feel that the Silents (who as far as he knows, have been quietly aiding humanity's ascension from the sidelines) must die?

And moreover why would he trick all of humanity into becoming murderers? He could have edited the footage to say ""rise against us"" or ""fight us"" or ""remember us"", but he kept it as ""kill us on sight"". That's just needlessly evil. Now a host of otherwise innocent humans will be turned into unwitting assassins for the Doctor.

And yet if he had just gone and *thought* for a few seconds about *why* the Daleks would need to act as slaves they would have been useless. Their ship won't recognize them as Daleks. They were no longer a threat. He could have asked for the schematics and carefully explained how to disassemble a Dalek and pacify them.

His tantrum is what gives them the power to restart their race. It's a boneheaded move, and an easily avoidable one at that.

How could he not be unhappy? How about the fact that he isn't actually going to die? How about coming to terms with the situation that you've known about *for years*. This moment you knew was coming, and you had a ""grand tour"" waiting period that you made full use of.

&gt;Principal Owner John Henry said: ""We are grateful for all of Damien's efforts on behalf of Liverpool and wish him all the best for the future.""

&gt;Liverpool Chairman Tom Werner added: ""The Club needs to move forward and we now have a huge game on Saturday. It is important that everyone joins us in supporting the manager and gets behind Kenny and the team and focuses on a strong finish to the season.""

&gt;Damien Comolli commented: ""I am grateful to have been given the opportunity to work at Liverpool and am happy to move on from the Club and back to France for family reasons. I wish the Club all the best for the future.""

And here's a quote from Kenny 
&gt;""Ive had a fantastic personal and working relationship with Damien.  Hes been really helpful, in every transfer target that weve gone for and everybody thats come into the club since Damien has been here was of my choice, and once I made the choice of who I wanted, damien went away and did a fantastic job of bringing them in, so it is sad to see anybody leave the football club, and he goes with certainly my best wishes and hopefully it's no long before we can meet up again.  As I say, for me, we had a great relationship so it's disappointing, but there's no very much in football that gives a surprise.  I wish him well in everything he does.""

I'm interested to see if he was actually sacked, and if so - the timing is a bit silly, or if he has 'family reasons' and he actually resigned? We'll find out soon enough I hope. I personally believe this was the right thing to happen anyway, and if he was sacked, it shows how ruthless FSG can be, which is good.

Also, is Kenny coming out and saying that simply a PR stunt so that players don't drop in confidence? Letting them know that Comolli wasn't sacked because they haven't been good enough, or is it genuine and therefore just means Comolli had to leave for family reasons?

EDIT: I can only see 3 realistic reasons for this to happen. Either 

1. Comolli genuinely had family reasons and thus had to leave to go back to France.

2. FSG just woke up to the fact that Damien Comolli isn't up to the job.

3. We have a new manager incoming who refused to work with Comolli.

I think the 3rd option is most likely, and Kenny will walk in the summer (I personally would want him to stay for 1 more season). ",0,1334226024,null,0,true,0,c4bcjbi,t3_s5y9k,t1_c4bcjbi,t3_s5y9k,null,1428705340,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

With it being criminalized you are subjecting those people to unfair prosecution in my opinion. They are not hurting anyone, and if they are it's only themselves though those people are only a very tiny percentage of the overall.

Clearly our government, and people like you, have no actual interest in proper science based policies when it comes to things like alcohol and tobacco and other drug use.

true,d_r_benway,null,null,"(although I posted this on a different thread recently - here are my arguments)

The simple fact is there is absolutely no moral reason at all for jailing ANYONE for the possession or cultivation of cannabis - absolutely NONE.

Below are my main reasons for saying this:-

**Cost of keeping if prohibited :-**

I spend (over a year) £1000's on weed - NONE of that money goes to the government it goes to criminal gangs (or brave friends who grow it...). 

Another fact - I pay my own way in life - always have done (never claimed the dole), - if I were jailed for cannabis possession (unlikely but still possible 5 year sentence) , they all of you would have to pay for my food and upkeep in jail - is that fair (or benefiting society)

Flying helicopters to search of grow rooms, searching everybody at train stations, etc costs a lot of money (that could be spent elsewhere), and pisses off the general public - I wonder if cannabis were legalised how many more police jobs would be saved (from the forthcoming cuts) - helicopter fuel ain't cheap....  Legalise weed = save police jobs !

**Relations with police :-** 

Until weed is at least decriminalised I will just not talk to police if I can help it - I know many otherwise law abiding people who do the same - perhaps if cannabis were decriminalised the police would have better relations

Legal drugs (like alcohol) ruin society far more:-

Just go to any town/city on a saturday night and see what I mean - its very very rare to hear of a gang of stoners kicking the shit out of someone - if happened every single weekend with alcohol - how can this be morally correct ?

**Contamination / public health:-**

Since the UK government crackdown on growhouses in 2006 the UK has been flooded with contaminated weed. By contaminated I mean sprayed with a substance (silica, etc) to mimic the look of THC - this means that a drug that according to most evidence is next to not harmful becomes lethal... All because of prohibition....

The old series is definitely cheesy in places due to monster design (they had a very low budget to begin with), but the writing and philosophy in the narratives are still very decent.

The one glaring flaw the original series have is pacing: it can take bloody ages for events to continue, and it can be very slow in places. If there's one thing that can put people off the old series, it's that, but if you watch a couple of episodes and don't find it too bad (I don't), then you'll be fine. As far as I can tell, the first couple of series are the worst, and once you get over that part you're more or less in the clear.

One thing I will say about the old series that makes it stand out is atmosphere - although it doesn't have the sweeping orchestral backing that the revived series has, it uses subtle music to create an almost constant sense of foreboding, which is a great sensation.

One thing I would DEFINITELY recommend is, once you've watched season 2 of the revived series, buy 'Genesis of the Daleks'. It's a great story arc, tells you how the Daleks were created (if you haven't encountered them yet in the revived series, whoo boy, you've got something great ahead of you) and can serve as an introduction to Tom Baker, one of the most revered actors to take up the role as the Doctor.

Sorry for the length, but I hope you've found that helpful.

1. Azpilicueta plays for Marseille, not Lille. Think they got too frothy mouthed about Joe Cole plying his trade abroad to pay attention to such details

2. Hazard at £25m? Yeah, not going to happen. Prices have been increasing steadily and with the amount of competition for his signature, you won't get him for that. £35m would be a more realistic amount, but this is just an opinion

3. Götze signed a new contract about 2 weeks ago, with his lifelong love and current happiness with everything at Dortmund (competing for the Bundesliga, definitely in the CL) singled out as major reasons for signing a new deal keeping him there until 2016

4. Hulk's release clause is 100m Euros, not Pounds

5. Given the above point, and Porto's usual unwillingness to do business unless the deal absolutely suits them, who honestly thinks he can be signed for £35m? They have no need to sell, his contract isn't running out, they won't settle for less than a ridiculous overvaluation. However, this is just an opinion, again

6. Modric will almost certainly leave Spurs? Bold claim. Of course, Spurs have improved compared to last season and £40m wasn't enough then. Will take stupid money to get Spurs to sell to one of their most fierce rivals

7. Cavani. Again, just an opinion here but Napoli are very conscious about holding on to the family jewels and most likely would only sell 1 of their star players, lest they alienate and piss off the fans. I think it would take more than the amount quoted, not exactly a lot of strikers around at the top level so the prices commanded have increased markedly

8. Pereira... Some chat from AVB about this one, but from AVB only. He doesn't look great and the case is further hampered by the fact that Porto wouldn't sell two of their best players to us, having lost Falcao this past Summer. They are trying to get away from the image of a selling club

9. Higuain is the most likely one here I think. Despite his father talking about how happy he is at Madrid, he doesn't get the chances someone with his record should probably be given. Also, didn't Madrid confirm that we bid for him in January, but that they rejected the possibility of losing a key player mid-season out of hand?

I think they found that Comolli didn't suit their style of management. Remember this guy is and old school French football administrator, and likely the antithesis of what owners from an American school of management are used to dealing with. 

I see these types of conflicts in business all the time. American and new European style business administration that is focused on software automation and tools, while the old school is little bits of paper and pointing to their foreheads when asked where the database is.

Comolli, from everything that I have read about him (and it is a lot) struck me as more of an old school guy. 

I'd like to see us experiment a bit here. Bring in some professional sports administrators from the USA and mix them with some of the better more modern scouts in the AVB Portugese style and re-establish a new first team system throughout not only Europe but Africa, Asia and the Americas. If you look at Comolli's history he hasn't done much outside of Europe.

While this decision shocked me, I have complete faith in the owners and their decision making only because they have a track record and history of being excellent managers in sports and in business.

As for your original question, I don't doubt he was sacked. These people are professionals, Comolli needs another job to move onto, he won't be burning bridges.

Azpilcueta could be a good signing. Only 22, he is quick and could replace Bosingwa. I wouldn't mind this, but for the price quoted? Nah. Against the pacey wingers like Bale, he could play and diminate, and Ivanovic whilst a solid RB, can struggle with that as he is naturally a CB.

Cavani, yes please. him or Lavezzi could do very well in the prem. Whether Napoli let them go is another question, but hopefully they were impressed with our comeback in the CL.

Not sure on Hulk, he's highly rated but I haven't watched him much. We don't need a right winger so much, I'm more concerned about our left. Sure he can play upfront, but if we move Sturridge back to his natural position so he can be more greedy, why?

But as for the team, it's really hard for him, one thing's for sure is we'll have jihad Tim in goal with his fucking silly beard he's growing back.

Distin had one bad game last week against Norwich and he didn't play against Sunderland so I'm guessing Heitinga and Jags, unless he's been rested. One could look at it another way and say Jagielka has come up against Liverpool twice this season and we conceded 5 goals whereas our stats with Heitinga and Distin are a lot better.

I'm just gonna call it as Distin and Heitinga for the semi, although the final may be different ;)

So in the middle from the back would be Gibson moving the ball around with Fellaini mopping up around him and in front of them both looking for the ball will be Timmy Cahill, surely, trying to link up with Jelavic.

That leaves wide players, without Peanuts, Baines is gonna be linking up with... (wild speculation time) Gueye and Neville (sorry Tony, he's played a lot more semi finals than you but I still love you) will be linking up with Osman. 

So basically I agree with you lot.

I think if we secure Champions League for next season, we could easily get Modric and Hazard or Hulk. I would probably prefer Hulk to Hazard as we could also get Shinji Kagawa for a decent price, as he has said he wants to come to either Chelsea or Man Utd next season.

We would also need a RB and Azpilicueta is not a bad choice, he is only 22 after all and we could get him for a decent price.

So all together, my wishlist (assuming we qualify for UCL) would be: Modric, Hulk, Kagawa, and Azpilicueta. With us getting rid of Bosingwa, Malouda, Kalou, Drogba and Meireles. 

Here is my dream team for next season:


-------------------Cech------------------

--Azpilicueta---Luiz---Terry------Cole-----

-----------Ramires-------Modric----------

-----Kagawa------Mata------Hulk--------

-------------Torres/Sturridge-------------

If Tottenham are being very difficult like last summer, then I would say screw Modric and get Hazard instead. Hulk might be more expensive than predicted and not end up coming, especially since we don't have the AVB connection any longer.

This is my more realistic hope for next season:

-----------------Cech-----------------

---Azp.----Luiz------Terry----Cole----

--------Ramires----Mikel/Romeu-------

----Kagawa-----Mata-----Hazard-----

-----------Sturridge/Torres-----------

I think this is a very good team and would only cost us:

Azpilicueta    -   22M

Hazard         -   25M

Kagawa        -   18M

The thing is, i understand that a lot of people can go off the rails with weed, but thats on reason to ban it at all. I've seen more people get addicted to the internet. It's simply a habit, not something thats genuinely hard to quit. You're not chasing a dragon, it's just an enjoyable thing. Some idiots convince themselves they're on a hard drug. No. If they didnt have weed, the people who's lives go downhill 'because of weed' would find something else to consume them.

And thank you for reminding me you cant ban the sun. Know why? You cant ban weed either. You can tell people it's illegal, but it will always be here. 

Prescription drugs 'hardly ever' kill people, yeah i'll buy that. But again,  it kills more people than weed. The side effects of many prescription drugs are worse than what weed can do.


Lets get this straight though, as i feel i have to differentiate myself from some of the defenders of weed on this thread. I do not believe it to be a miracle plant. I dont think it's absolutely perfect, only ever doing good in peoples lives, and i dont think anyone who smokes it is automatically a saint. But the problems that actually occasional arise because of weed are so rare and so laughable that to actually keep it illegal is absolutely absurd.

It helps some people. It's a pain killer. It can increase appetite. It can help with anxiety, it can help with depression, it can help creatively. These arent all shady claims, these are simply observances anyone can make. If everyone around you who smokes weed is a scatty motherfucker, you're simply surrounded by scatty motherfuckers. Very often scatty motherfuckers smoke weed.


And lastly, if i want to inhale the smoke produced from burning a plant that groes naturally, i should be allowed too. No motherfucker should be able to criminalize me for doing what i want in the comfort of my own home. There is simply no rational reason for turning someone into a criminal because all they wanted to do was smoke a bit of weed.",0,1334238786,null,0,false,0,c4bdxfn,t3_s4ipw,t1_c4bdxfn,t1_c4b8vwd,null,1428705998,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

- First of all Britain did not lose the Empire, it was well on its evolutionary path to becoming the Commonwealth when Hitler was still in short shorts; the Imperial Conference in 1926 stated that all dominions were in equal status to Britain, the Statue of Westminster in 1931 put the legislation on the books.  The Empire emerged from its chrysalis a beautiful Commonwealth butterfly that had actually been in the planning for over half a century, even before the First World War.

- Secondly, yes we emerged from the Second World War battered, worn and scratched but bones heal and chicks dig scars, and we should wear these scars with pride.  As Stalin said, *Great Britain provided time, the United States provided money and Soviet Russia provided blood.*  Well, all the money and blood in the world wouldn't have made a scratch of difference if they hadn't had 'time' to spend it. That's not to dismiss the  contributions of others.  We were in it at the very beginning, and we were still in it at the very end.   Any post-match bruising is, and should be worn as, a badge of honour.

- Third, the swinging 60s - British fashion became globally iconic.  The Beatles.  The Rolling Stones.  Sure there was some piffle about economics but we were too busy playing the long game and having a cultural explosion,  baby!  We didn't even stop in the 70s or the 80s;  we owned glam rock and the pop scene.  Then, in the 90s and 00s, thanks to subliminal messaging planted throughout the Harry Potter chronicles, which became a global phenomenon, the Golden Age is upon us once more.

When I was young, we just didn't have readily-available vids of a woman being abused by 3 guys, with two huge cocks in her ass causing her visible pain, being slapped in the face by the other one, and being choked for sexual kicks.  But that sort of imagery is everywhere now.  We're certainly shaped by our experiences, and the experience for youngsters these days includes a prevalent reinforcement of degrading sexual attitudes towards women that just wasn't there 10-15 years ago.  Obviously it's not the only factor, otherwise that imagery wouldn't exist in the first place, but the notion that it's easier now for such an attitude towards sex to become seen as the norm has some merit.  
  
But frankly I agree with you regarding parental responsibility; I'm really not convinced that the true motivation of parents has anything to do with a sexist approach to sex.  I can't help but feel that, generally speaking, if parents actually took the time to ensure that their kids are aware of sex from a young age, and that the kids are at least partially prepared for the social pressure that comes along with it, then these problems would largely disappear.  Instead, it seems that this is yet more confirmation of the notion that parents are completely in denial about the sexual nature of their teens, and that they think teen sex is something inherently bad, which needs to be blamed on something or someone.

Do you have sources? I'm curious because I never really saw him as ""old school""; he certainly seems more statistic-minded that most ""DoF""/managers. 

&gt; While this decision shocked me, I have complete faith in the owners and their decision making only because they have a track record and history of being excellent managers in sports and in business.

After being burnt by our last owners, I'm reluctant to ever say I have 'complete faith' :P But yes, they do have a far better track record and it's a bit unfair for me to compare them to H&amp;G. Still, regardless of whether this was the right/wrong decision, it says a lot more about FSG than we've seen in a while. What I mean by that is:
1. They're not afraid to be ruthless. This might also have consequences for the future of players; it might be that, despite having only been signed 1-1.5 years ago, some members of the squad may be moved on. (It might not, and I'm not calling for anyone to be shipped on either, but just a possibility). It might also have consequences for the manager, but at the same time I think they value stability and Dalglish will get at least one more season.
2. They now feel that they know enough about football to make a big decision like this. This is a big deal, because a lot of their early talk (justifiably) was about them needing to learn as much as they could about the sport and listening to people who knew more. Now it'll be interesting to see how they combine their vision for the club with their improved knowledge of how the sport works.

What people say though is that Dalglish is the one who wanted all the British players, not Comolli, and all the British players we have brought in have been shit, and I predicted at least Adam and Henderson to be shit before they arrived, because they've never been very good players.

I'm also inclined to believe that this is true, since Comolli has found some great players in the past (Taraabt, Boateng, Bale, Modric, Berbatov, Kolo Touré etc.).

Basically, we need to buy better players, but I'm not sure this is the right way to ensure that happens.

One thing that caught my eye:
&gt;Paul Tomkins, in Pay as You Play: The True Price of Success in the Premier League Era, calculated that of Comolli's signings, around 30 percent were big profit-makers, and 25 percent flops, with the rest somewhere in between, with an ""overall estimated genuine profit of £26.5M ($41M)"".

So, he's made 8 significant first-team signings (sorry Doni, you don't count). Lets afford him 2 big profit makers, 2 flops, and 4 in between.

Profit makers = Suarez, Enrique (might make a case for Coates at some point, but too early to know)

In between = Bellamy (not a ""profit maker"", hence he ends up here), Henderson (potential), Adam, Coates

Flops = Downing, Carroll (yes, both might come good, but will never live up to their valuations, and in that sense are regarded flops.)

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"Wow, very surprising news to wake up to this morning. Some quick thoughts:

* If any changes were going to be made, I surely thought it would be *after* the season ended. The article also mentioned the curiosity in the timing of this.

* To me, this tells me that Dalglish won't be sacked (for those of you hoping for this) any time soon. I doubt FSG would overhaul the entire front office and coaching staff and have a new director of football and a new manager with players that they may not have ever wanted in the first place.

* As for who is to ""blame"" Dalglish/Comolli for our signings? Surely it's a bit of both. But I think Comolli ultimately was the one to blame because he was responsible for the money side of things. Would we be complaining about Carroll as much if he was only 15m GBP? Probably not. (*EDIT*: I do understand that simply signing Carroll for 15m pounds is easier said than done, I get that there are a lot of economic and leverage factors that came into our overpaying for players. Perhaps the point is that we should have overpaid for the right players?).

As for FSG:

* Sacking Comolli certainly shows that they are willing to make a change when they perceive that something is not working.

* In a way, they are admitting they made a mistake as well and they're willing to identify that quickly and move forward. (I feel this is different than, say, the Abramovich Way).

* The key for FSG, though, is that they really need to give the director of football position a lot of thought and bring in someone with a lot of experience. Like Comolli but someone who fits with FSG better.

* FSG may be new to the sport but they're not new to running a sports franchise and they're not idiots. I think they'll make smart decisions moving forward.",0,1334243886,null,0,true,0,c4bexei,t3_s5y9k,t1_c4bexei,t3_s5y9k,null,1428706475,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

I never had faith in Hicks and Gillet. It was a leveraged buyout. You may remember that at the time there were some fans who were actively protesting the takeover because of the debt part of it - turns out they were right! What we didn't know at the time was just how bad the financial situation was with Hicks and Gillet. They both took out large loans to pay the deposits for the LFC purchase. Their argument at the time is that while they are both financially wealthy and will be injecting a lot of money into the club, it is 'common business' today (then) to take on debt to allow growth because it is so cheap. Turns out every dollar invested was debt.

They also had a history of screwing up their other ownership stakes. I think NESV are in a different league.

Btw re Comolli, I asked an agent on Twitter who I know knows things around LFC about him and she just replied:

true,Kalivha,eng-warwickshire,Coventrry/Edinburgh,"&gt;You are saying these kinds of things because you don't feel such a strong attachment to the UK and British people. You don't share as many genes with the majority UK population, and you refer to Pakistan as 'home'.

I'm not Pakistani. At least half of what I said wouldn't make any sense whatsoever if I was.

I'm from a developed country with a good social welfare system (I did criticise the UK's and said it was comparatively worse in one of my posts), my immediate family never were immigrants anywhere (my brother and his wife did working holidays in Southern/Eastern Europe and Israel, but that's about it), I think part of it is just that I pretty much lack a ""traditional"" national identity for myself so I can't make sense of it for other people. I do actually feel a stronger attachment to the British than to my own people - and I think that in today's world, it's unrealistic to expect someone's national and cultural identity to be entirely dependent on the fact that they were born in the same country as their parents and grandparents. I do have preferences and attachments (which are more based on my experiences than my ancestry) but ultimately I pretty much think of the whole world as a sort of extended family. 

&gt;But what about asylum seekers? Sure, they had some funds to get over, but if their home is in such a bad state, how do they get at the rest of their funds?

See, I've just held the belief since childhood that if a home could go to asylum seekers (who are people in a *really* bad situation and should definitely be able to get help) or anyone else, I'd give it to the asylum seekers - I also mentioned in one of my earlier posts that my family lived in a flat like that for no good reason other than the neighbourhood being affluent and the rich people not wanting lower class people around too much.

&gt;But how can we be sure the immigrants are 'decent human beings'?

Two points - I'll always assume people are decent human beings until proven otherwise; I know this is not an argument, I just think it's good to approach people positively in general because they tend to reciprocate.

The second is that people aren't suddenly more likely to be 'bad' because they are immigrants. Why would you complain about immigrants not being decent and not complain about the British people who are just horrible? Why does it even matter where someone is from when determining this? I get it, you don't want to let people who hurt society into the country. Yet you don't remove the ones you've already got (because of their **birthright**), and either way I don't think it's a big problem - we're not in the business of making a perfect country of awesome people here, and even if we were I'd say it is very unfair to send all the assholes to other countries to make those places worse. I think it'll just end up being ±0 as far as that goes and no restriction on immigration is going to change that.",0,1334244521,null,0,false,0,c4bf2ec,t3_s30lx,t1_c4bf2ec,t1_c4bd1zz,null,1428706533,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

There are many other powers to search but I would not be surprised if over 95% of searches were using this legislation. To see your rights look up GOWISELY in relation to section 1 PACE. 

The power for the police to stop a vehicle comes from 

1)Section 163 Road Traffic Act (1988), any constable in uniform may stop any vehicle at any time.

2)Section 4 PACE for the power to create road checks

3)Section 165, Road Traffic Act, to seize vehicles.

The power for the police to demand a breath test comes from Section 6, Road Traffic act
