true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"People that don't know maths think people should look at an equation and be able to use it to mindlessly calculate numbers. For a modern mathematician calculation is when you've ran out of good ideas. American's call it ""plug and chug"" look at the quadratic equation and apply it to the form ax2 + bx + c = 0. This is a process that a junior programmer can solve in a few hours. Ok it teaches algebraic substitution but mindlessly doing the calculation over and over again is pointless.

I expect there are millions of adults that think they'll never be good at maths because of this kind of education. The number of programmers I meet that ""can't do "" maths is astounding; programming *is* maths in the purest way: abstracting a problem into its logical form, but they don't see it like this because they have been taught maths is about calculation;  its not. Maths is, in its simple form, abstraction; knowing that two apples can be represented by the number 2 and that adding that to pile of apples, x, gives x + 2 apples.

&gt; The proposals include recommendations for primary-age children to learn their times tables up to 12 x 12...

Ok, being able to estimate is a useful skill but like most people I use maths *every day*. I wouldn't be in a maths related field if it involved blindly memorising tables of numbers. Statistics is taught in a similar way ""apply student's t test with the table overleaf"" we have computers for this now, yes its important that you know how the operation works but this means the *theory of the computation* is the important thing not actually computing things.

With computers you can teach kids calculus at age 7 and get them inspired by the creative beauty of high level mathematical concepts like limits and the concept of infinity.

I really liked the Opening Ceremony. I thought it was heartfelt, well thought out, and came together as a wonderful explanation and exploration of British history, culture, and entertainment. I disliked the closing ceremony. Here are several reasons why as stated in my original post: 

1\. I didn't understand many of the references -- I do not mean to assert that any country that hosts the Olmypics should not insert in-jokes, nor should they try to go for International or mass appeal. The host country should feel free to do whatever they like. I do also do not expect them to have references to any American TV shows (before, during, or after my time in the US), nor to the Hebrew Bible. I had to spend a lot of time asking my husband what things mean. This is to do with my own personal difficulty in understanding. 

2\. I thought the closing ceremony felt disjointed. It was almost as thought there were several shows going on, none of which had anything to do with each other. I though it lacked the together feel of the Opening Ceremony. 

3\. I was wondering why they repeated the same song over and over, but henleyregatta kindly explained to me that this was because they thought they could get 10,000 performers in with two songs. Thank you, henleyregatta for explaining this to me. 

4\. My (100% English, British born) husband disliked the music choices that were chosen, and I agree. Again, not stating that any American songs or American performers should have been chosen, nor stating that they should go for Universal, wide, or mass appeal. I simply did not like the song choices. 

The performers are all extremely hard working people who did a superb job in performing. The UK did an amazing job on the Olympics, and I'm certainly proud of my second country. 

It was not my intention to offend anyone r/unitedkingdom for stating my opinion. Your downvotes and comments towards my other nationality have made me realize that my opinion and comments were hurtful, negative, and downright disrespectful. I did in no way mean to assert my other nationality over any other nationalities, especially British.

true,Buckeye70,canada,Half,"Sure, I agree with most of what you said. When I was growing up there was a shit ton of bad music (disco through hair bands), but I got exposed to more than just crap pop music as a kid. What I appreciate is musical talent. And call me wrong (I don't care) but I don't see talent in people who talk in a rhythmic fashion over a computerized beat. I respect a musician who toiled for years to learn an instrument, understand theory, and compose a song. 

Now that's not to say a great song can't be written by someone who isn't an accomplished composer or anything like that. Dylan, Neil Young and many others wrote simple, 3-chord songs, but there's just something different to me when I compare these guys with the no-talent hacks that I see parading around like they are gods gift to music.

A couple of years ago, on the Grammys, I saw Fleet Foxes, Mumford &amp; Sons and Dylan blow the fucking roof off the place. There, in front of what's considered today's pop royalty were a bunch of guys who were *musicians*, actually *playing* an instrument. I hope all of those crap-ass pop stars realized then and there how shallow and worthless their songs about bitches, ass, and whatever the hell else they ""sing"" about are. In front of them was a display of true songwriting and real artistry. That night was awesome for me.

Yeah, I'm old and I hate today's music. But you know what? It's not made *for* me. I know that. Just don't expect me to ever enjoy listening to 99% of it.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; It's racially insensitive to make jokes about racism that are in bad taste.

And who decides that? 

There are plenty of current popular comedians whose routines frequently mock various demographics be it based on race, sex, religion, political background, wealth etc. and d'you know what? People laugh, then they move on. You'd have to be particularly weak willed to soak up what is said like a sponge and parrot it as ""truth"". 

So who decides that something is in bad taste? There's no hard and fast rule to this - only how sensitive you are vs. what is being said. I won't deny that there are *bad* jokes etc. but again to assume that every joke made on the subject of race is a bad one is pure idiocy (being fair, just as it's idiocy to assume that every racist joke is *good* as well - this works both ways).

Basically, I feel Paul Lambert and Brendan Rodgers were key to those teams performing so well. That and Swansea losing some good players (Siggy, Allen). I never rated Norwich's squad that highly, Lambert did brilliantly to get the best out of them. Houghton's a good manager but he'll struggle. Holt ain't getting any younger, and an injury to him or Morrison and they'd be up shit creek. Liverpool and Villa's seasons will reflect positively as a result of having the managers mentioned above.

George Michael singing his new single? Really? Do we NEED that? Jessie Jay unironically driving around in a Bentley singing ""It's not about the money"". Russell Brand? Singing badly? Is that what we should have had? 

But it was more than all that: It was the intangible. The opening ceremony, while a bit cringy in one or two very brief moments, was great - and not just the spectacle of the giant industrial stuff - it was all quite fun, without being obvious. The NHS beds thing was a great, fun idea, with lots of inventive variations.

It all felt like 'British' without being too obvious. It felt creative and inspired and like some care and passion went into it.

Then we get to the Closing ceremony and it felt like a committee sat around and thought up stuff off the top of their heads.

European population has no bearing. The European population of Corncrake is in the many thousands yet we have under 500 in the UK.  Do you wish for us to have none but as long as Europe has some it's okay? That's stupid because how then can we, the British populace, protect these birds in another land? On that note, those Hen Harrier figures jump up and down like a yoyo. That's exactly why the RSPB want to keep them safe and protected.

But that's irrelevant.

It's irrelevant because he's not playing for Madrid or Barcelona, he's playing for us. If you flip it on its head, Valdes wouldn't start for us each week so is he therefore not good enough for Barcelona? Khedira? Busquets? Arbeloa? Jerome Boateng? Luiz Gustavo? Toni Kroos? Mario Gomez?

That argument is a nonsense because these players fit into the teams that they play for. To say, ""oh they wouldn't start for Chelsea"" is irrelevant because they don't have to.

But with football, it's money. Completely corrupted by money. If the difference between being promoted to the Premier League and not, you might just try to get that penalty that wins your club £60m. I don't think it's good, I don't approve of it, but it is a sad reality of the system. I wish that refs would red card any and every player who surrounds him so it's only the captain who can. Sure, it would cause a lot of reds right away but people would learn.

Why are footballers such petulant fucks? Probably because the game is non-contact. When you feel wronged, you want to make it right, get revenge or whatever. In Rugby, you can smash up against your opponent and let him know you were there and it's a completely legal maneuver, in football this isn't such an option, so instead you have a guy with his testosterone flowing and thinking (from being told every single day) that he's the dog's bollocks, annoyed on a pitch. Decides to take matters into his own hands. Feels cheated, cheats to win. 

Personally, have attended a number of sporting events, I completely prefer going to see a football game in the away stand. The tension and atmosphere make for a brilliant few hours.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't really think I could answer this well enough in reddit to do the real answer justice.  And I'm bound to get a few responses picking up on the obvious shortcomings of this answer by people that consider themselves champions of the people, who have leik totally picked up on something I've missed, but:

 I suppose it has a lot to do with what is expected - or rather demanded of me to be interested in.  We live in a tolerant, multi-cultural and sympathetic society - which is good.  I have black friends, gay friends, disabled friends (shit, I've even got white middle-class male friends).  We party, hang and work together.  But every now and then, someone I don't know comes along, and tells me that I should be accepting of black people, I should not be prejudice of someone because of their sexuality and I should actively care about the plight of disabled people.  

 It's sort of like if I were to walk around a shop, and every now and then someone just comes out of nowhere and points to a sign that says ""Don't steal"", y'know just to make sure I knew.  This guy is of course not wrong, but he is also an arsehole.

 I find this whole ""superhuman"" marketing idea a bit awkward too.  Sure, they've worked really fucking hard, and overcome numerous adversities (kind of like almost everyone that's alive really), but there's no need to label the paralympians with this ""superhuman"" badge of honour.  It's like calling all soldiers ""heros"".  Some are heros, others are there because they did shit at school and like shooting arabs.  I don't want to labour the point or stretch metaphors, but I get the distinct smell of hyperbole and inauthenticity for the purpose of letting people convince themselves that they are 'better than thou' for being interested in the Paralympics.
 
 I'm glad that I live in a society that has the character that allows for things like the Paralympics to exist.  But simply having that character doesn't justify celebrating these things in such a decorated fashion.  If you truly do accept people of all colours, creeds, abilities etc, then you don't actually have to sing about it.  You just *do* it - like it's nothing, like it's natural to you.  If you need to remind everyone you're doing it, it highlights the fact that your trying really hard to incorporate these people, which means it is anything but natural for you to do so.

 I knew I couldn't do this justice here, and I've just realised how deep I think this goes.  I s'pose I was working this through for me rather than reddit.  I of course have nothing against the Paralypics, I wish everyone the best of luck - I just don't care who the fastest one-legged man is, and I don't think anyone else does either, not really.",0,1344870484,null,0,false,0,c5sg6al,t3_y3plf,t1_c5sg6al,t1_c5sfirf,null,1429626374,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

One point of substance to lay against him was his dubious behaviour over phone hacking. He defended John Yates on that review that turned out to be extremely cursory, even after it had emerged that the evidence had not been properly considered. He described the whole scandal as ""a load of codswallop cooked up by the Labour Party"" which was ""patently politically motivated"" and ""a politically motivated put up job"" and ""completely spurious and political"" and ""a song and dance about nothing"" which had been ""whipped up by the Guardian and the Labour Party."" (see [here](http://www.adambienkov.com/2011/07/what-boris-johnson-really-thinks-about.html)).

Combine that with his schmoozing of Murdoch, his almost spotless coverage in the press, and the character testimonials in the article, and perhaps you begin to get a glimpse behind the mask.

Also, one of the issues with coming up with a substantial look at Boris' politics and policies is identifying what they actually are. The mayor of London is a role with few powers, and Boris has never positioned himself ideologically on any issue more weighty than cycling. Even there, he has a lot of warm words, but hasn't actually done much beyond completing Livingstone's bike hire plan.

true,Sleww,lfc68,,"A few things:

* I don't think BR questions Carroll's skill and ability to adapt at all. If anyone is doing that, it's probably idiotic Arsenal and United fans on Twitter. Instead, I think BR has realized that with Borini, Suarez, and (most likely) Dempsey coming in, Carroll won't be the starter. 80k/week is too much to pay for a backup, so BR is looking for good offers. If a good offer doesn't come along, I'm sure BR wouldn't mind keeping him, but he is definitely not marked as ""not for sale"" like Suarez, Lucas, Gerrard etc.

* Personally, I'm excited for Hendo, Cole, and Downing. Downing has already shown more in the last 4 games than he did all last season. He's playing with some confidence and the system really seems to be benefiting him. I think everyone in this subreddit agrees that Hendo will flourish under BR. He just needs some time to learn under Stevie and Lucas. I think that Cole will be the most surprising player on the team this year. When he's on the pitch, I can always see the passion and the will to succeed. He always tracks back to defend, and he's very tactically sound.

* Honestly, I think Sahin would rather come to us than Arsenal. You shouldn't believe Twitter usually. I highly doubt Arsenal and Madrid are in advanced talks. And even if they were, they'd hardly tell the ""football agents"" on Twitter. While we may not offer Sahin CL football like Arsenal can, we can offer him 35+ games for us this season whereas he'll only get 20-25 at Arsenal. Their midfield is packed (they have like 6 solid midfielders). After the year wasted in Madrid (I think he only played 9 or so games), he will most likely only be looking for game time rather than anything else. I think we're the best fit for him and some usually reliable sources have confirmed that he's close to signing with us.

* Tello would indeed be a good addition to our squad. I think he's a bit overrated and only has speed, but for the right price, I'd love to see him at Anfield. The problem, though, is that Barca have received offers from maybe 5 or 6 clubs in regards to Tello. It will be tough for us to win a bidding war against the likes of Inter.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"It's the same with football.  When I was a kid, first division football matches were shown on the BBC and ITV.  Nothing to pay except the licence fee.

Then Sky (or BSkyB as it was then) came along and offered the top clubs a shitload of money if they would break away from the first division and start the Premier League.  They priced everyone else (including the BBC) out of the market for the rights and established an effective monopoly knowing that they could then charge top dollar for football and people would pay up to follow their favourite team.  

Incidentally, this was all happening a few years after the Hillsborough disaster.  The outcome of which was the Taylor report which required all stadia to be converted to seating-only by 1994.  As a result ground capacities went down and ticket prices went up (I remember my sister used to have an Arsenal season ticket and the price went up from something like £300 to just under £1000 in one season).  Suddenly, the idea of paying just £20 a month to watch *all* the Premier League matches didn't look so bad after all.  If memory serves, uptake of satellite TV had been very slow up until that point.  There was little incentive for people to pay extra money for satellite TV when they could already watch football, motor racing, etc., on the BBC and ITV.  Taking football away from the terrestrial channels was the leverage that Sky needed to get into people's houses.

The other big effect of all this was that professional footballers went from being sportsmen getting paid reasonable salaries to celebrities commanding silly money.  All paid for by the fans (minus Sky's share, of course).

CAVEAT: I haven't really followed football since then so I'm speaking as a bit of an outsider.  My apologies if I've mis-remembered anything or got the facts wrong.  Corrections welcome.

You realize that if we do sign a ""creative"" player we're going to see a massive drop-off in ability no matter what, right? Unless you think we can attract Xavi or Iniesta...

The only affordable player who can come close to Modric has been purchased by our rivals. I'd rather buy M'Vila for 12m and use a different type of midfield and put Modric money towards a top striker than fucking splooge 25m on Joao Moutinho who isn't fit to lace Modric's boots. 

Sahin is a possibility I guess, but I suspect he ends up at Arsenal because he probably wants to play in the CL.

I think you have to accept that there aren't a lot of players lining up to play on Thursday nights. Not everyone is Vertonghen; we do have to suffer for what happened last season. Even M'Vila probably doesn't want to come here too terribly. 

I think we should sign a midfielder for under 15m if possible and put more money towards a striker.

Also my pipe dream is then signing Kovacic :3.

The majority of the kid's parents simply write a cheque and send them off, while others (like my friend) get support from the school.

I help coach my local state school's rugby team. A few of them went to the museum. Their parents paid for it 100%, they didn't get lunch, they had a half hour talk from a curator/expert person and were left to do whatever they wanted thereafter. Our team has to share a bus with another school.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"I don't think Moutinho is worth 25m which is what it's going to take to get him. He's a fine player, but even he's very different from Luka. If we want that sort of player I'd rather go after Jordy Clasie who is younger and cheaper.

Levy isn't stupid enough to waste that much money on Moutinho and I think AVB understands that he can play a different system for a much more realistic price.

I'm not saying Moutinho wouldn't be a good ""replacement"" -- in fact he'd probably be ideal because AVB knows exactly what he can get from him. But 25 million pounds? Who they think they got, Chelsea Clinton?

I also don't think M'Vila is a CDM in the same way that Sandro and Parker are. True, he's athletic and likes to win the ball, but he can actually pass the ball forward (the horror!). For France he plays sort of an anchorman role but even then he plays more incisively than either of our defensive midfielders. 

There are a few different ways we could do this with M'Vila IMO. Personally I'd love to see him play sort of that anchor role for us because he's more positionally disciplined than Sandro or Parker. He's capable of keeping play ahead of him at almost all times. This would allow one of the other two to be sort of that box-to-box midfielder which they are both capable of. 

Parker for example played much more of an attacking role for West Ham. This is why he is so poor positionally; he's really not a natural anchor. Sandro also likes to get forward and he's shown signs of having the power and control to do this (THAT Blackburn run). 

M'Vila could also develop into that type of player, because he has excellent technique on the ball and is a very good athlete. I'm not saying we'll choose to turn him into a Yaya type of player, but physically he definitely has the attributes for it. 

We could definitely play sort of a Barry / Toure pivot if we signed M'Vila. Obviously it wouldn't be at that level, but our Modric ""replacement"" doesn't HAVE to be like-for-like.

My only concern with this is link play. VDV is very good at dropping deep to do this, but it's not really Gylfi's game and he prefers to stay higher up when we have the ball. ",0,1344878760,null,0,false,0,c5sidm2,t3_y5fks,t1_c5sidm2,t1_c5si5in,null,1429627483,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

But up front is where this is hurting us. It's a lot easier to build a midfield than it is to find someone who can fucking score goals. Adebayor will be a great signing if it comes through, but I do think at some point we might need to loosen up for that position. 

I really don't want to see us spending 25m on a midfielder. We don't need that. But my point was just in general, it's unfair to have certain expectations and then not back the manager fully. To allow a new manager to go through an entire pre-season with no striker was pretty unacceptable in my opinion.

I like looking for good deals, but at some point we do need to buy something if we want to push forward. There are great players who are affordable but we rarely seem to be aware of them. ",0,1344878983,null,0,false,0,c5sifwf,t3_y5fks,t1_c5sifwf,t1_c5si7ye,null,1429627508,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

true,ravniel,num11,,"My point was really more about backing the manager than about any individual player.  I don't know Moutinho that well and would have trouble placing a value on him, but if there *were* a midfielder on the market genuinely worth 25m, one AVB had his heart set on and really believed could be a key player in his system, I like to hope we'd consider that investment whether or not Levy believed he could shave 10m off the price.  I don't think we would, honestly, and I sure as shit hope AVB was told that before he signed.  I have nightmare visions of us doing a Chelsea and not giving him the leeway he believed he'd have in putting a decent team together.

The striker situation is, I fully agree, where things have really gotten pants-on-head ridiculous.  When I made my rambling self-post two weeks ago I already thought it was patently absurd that AVB was still being forced to train without a senior striker; if it was absurd then I don't even know what to call it now.  *Totally* unacceptable.  We're all out of friendlies, the season starts in under a week, that it was ever allowed to get this far is completely mind-boggling to me.  AVB must be livid.

&gt; There are great players who are affordable but we rarely seem to be aware of them.

This is, I think, a key issue nobody discusses.  Where are our scouts in all this?  I'd be happy with bargain-hunting if I thought we were really effective at unearthing buried gems but for the most part the bargains we seem to be looking for are players everybody already knows about.  That either means we'll have trouble getting selling clubs to negotiate on price (in which case Levy simply walks away, for the most part) or there's some kind of good reason we don't have competition for the player's signature (as in M'Vila's case, where there are serious concerns about his attitude).  I like bargain-hunting if it means finding value where it hasn't been spotted yet; not so much if it means simply sniffing around everyone else's targets until a deal with them falls through.

I'm actually pretty comfortable with M'Vila specifically, if these rumors are true, but they're evidence of a wider trend of frugality that has gone beyond what I'm comfortable with.",0,1344880104,null,0,false,0,c5sirgn,t3_y5fks,t1_c5sirgn,t1_c5sifwf,null,1429627657,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

After Arthur takes it, Matt grabs the camera to get one of me with Arthur while Karen sneaks behind us to photo bomb in the background, but then we get distracted by Matt lunging to catch the door as it starts to close on his floor.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"I think we'd see more of a traditional double pivot in which the deep-lying midfielders share defensive and attack duties. With Modric our DM basically exists to win the ball and give it to him. With a double pivot both players need to be able to move forward but also defend.

Arsenal are a good blueprint for how a team with a double pivot builds attacks. Arteta and Song don't do a lot of dribbling or surging forward like Modric; they play the ball into the feet of their advanced players or their more advanced midfielder (Rosicky last season, probably Cazorla this season) picks it up deeper and does the running.

This is to me the biggest issue with this setup and the reason M'Vila isn't my first choice. Our #10 players are not very mobile. VDV and Gylfi can't exactly come back and pick it up and then run forward with pace. We still really lack consistent forward drive if we had M'Vila and Sandro, IMO. 

Not saying it couldn't work, but we'd see a lot of passes into the feet of our forward players and a lot of probing. We'd also be more solid defensively. 

Personally I wish we'd pursue Dembele more than anything in the world. Jol used him as a CM last season and it was fucking perfect. He's exactly what we need IMO. An incredible dribbler who works his ass off in defense and runs forward with the ball from deep and links the play. And he'd be much cheaper than Moutinho.

2. There is a *huge* backlog of stuff. Remember, the show ran for *decades*. It's going to take you longer than a month.

3. Several of the stories were, and still are, lost. The BBC destroyed (I believe) the tapes of most of the 2nd Doctor's adventures, as well as some of the 1st's. 

If you're still interested, I suggest at the very least watching an adventure or two from each Doctor to get a feel for them. I think it'll give you a better idea of how the character's changed over the years.

The BBC is funded by the licence fee - that is to say, the taxpayer (me) pays a licence fee of £145.50 a year to watch TV. The BBC exists to serve the public, and its mission is to inform, educate and entertain - this is governed by the BBC Trust to ensure that the BBC does what it should do: http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/

As part of this, the BBC cannot make money commercially on the shows they produce - this would include streaming the shows for a fee for international audiences.

The only way this would be able to be offered is through BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of the BBC. However, because there is plenty of red tape due to copyrights, licencing, potential conflicts with the BBC's charter etc., this is a slow process.

The current trial is being held with the iPad in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Ireland, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. In which customers can pay for content on a monthly or annual basis. This may well be extended.

Somebody? That is laughably bad on its own, but made worse by editorialisation. It is ridiculously misleading. We don't even really know what it means, and it wasn't ad-free either. They were plastered all oven the shirts and stadia. We don't know if some of that 15billion was siphoned to the BBC.

The actual maths is: `(145 / 52) * 2 = 5.58` (at least they got the rounding correct). This is a gross and misleading attempt at accounting and journalism.

true,GappyHilmore,IT,italy,"Hulk, Moses and Schurrle are ideal targets. All of them can play RW or striker if need be. I think Sturridge is currently better than Moses but Moses is a more complete player/winger with upside, whereas Sturridge is against being put on the wing.

But I don't think Chelsea should pay over £35 for Hulk or £25 for Schurrle even though either one would be a great addition. 


Being linked with BIG name strikers like Llorente, Cavani, and Lewandowski was always going to happen because we lost a big name striker in Drogba. But Chelsea don't need a BIG name striker right now because we have Torres, Sturridge and Piazon(who I think has a tremendous upside.)


Although come January and Torres isn't banging in the goals and we are still in the running for UCL, FA cup and Premier League title, then Chelsea will need to sign someone. Most likely Cavani, being that his agent said he will move to the EPL in January if it doesn't happen this summer. And that Napoli are interested in Miereles can only help the cause. This is only if Schurrle or Hulk are not signed and Torres is under-performing though. 

EDIT: As for RB I figure they're going to sign Azpilicueta and if not I trust our scouts to find a solid replacement.  


IMO the goal Torres scored in the Community Shield shows his confidence. That was a strikers goal and the whole game he looked worlds apart from the Torres at the end of last season when he was improving under RDM.

2. I think the show is largely driven by the actor portraying the Doctor. And keep in mind that [there are a lot of different writers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_writers) and it appears Russel T. Davies wrote the ""first"" 25 episodes and then other people have been writing them. So there's that as well. 

For me, the ninth Doctor is really different from the tenth, who in turn is really different from the eleventh. So like TerrorOfTheTimeLords pointed out, not only does production value rise but you also get a different feel from the show. So, I mean, don't think that the first two episodes of the ninth Doctor can let you accurately judge the whole series (much less Doctors 1-8!).

I would suggest watching at least up to The Empty/Child and The Doctor Dances. They are some of the less campy episodes of the first series. Also has the added benefit of being written by Moffat so you know if you would like the later series. 

When the first series was made they really did not know if they would get a second series so is slightly more aimed at a broader audience than the later series when the could concentrate on making the show the way they wanted to. But even then there is quite a bit of camp thrown in. 

It is worth remembering that the 2005 series is a continuation of the previous 9 doctors stories, which while you don't need to know any of what has come  before to get the show, it is at heart just as you said - A campy show from the 70's (and decades around then)",0,1344895836,null,0,false,0,c5snayo,t3_y60gf,t1_c5snayo,t1_c5smyxo,null,1429629801,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

Not really, his formation might be *similar* to Benitez's, but the style isn't the same. Both use high pressing, yes, but Rafa prioritised distribution from flank-to-flank (hence, Xabi) and involved more movement on the ball than Rodgers, who's always been an off-the-ball movement guy. Rafa's system prioritised *the system*, with positioning and minor details incredibly important. Brendan's (and I'm including the way he implemented in at Swansea as well) involved more the idea, certain rules supplementing an implementation of a *philosophy* rather than a lot of rules dictating when you're allowed to be creative. 

If anything, Rafa and Mourinho are more similar than Rafa and Rodgers (so it's not surprise that some of that thinking's filtered down to Brendan). Rodgers has more in common with the classic Dutch (and hence, modern Spain) philosophy than Rafa. A lot more differences, obviously, but I think that's enough to point out that this comparison is pretty superficial.

I obviously won't be able to get past the old ""you're being high and mighty"" role reversal / chewbacca defence.

I know exactly what Essien is.
Stating what he's meant to be, does my change the fact that he played the defensive role well.

It's like saying that because Sturridge is a striker, we shouldn't be playing him on the right - because we have someone who's listed as an RW on their Wikipedia page. Irrelevant.

When Essien DID play the holding role, he was far more consistent at it than Mikel has ever been - despite what his natural playstyle leans toward.

Ultimately we're on the same side here - wanting the best team out there. But many of us just think we can do better than or rather.. want better FROM Mikel. 

I'll be happy if he plays consistently at a high level.
Unfortunately, he hasn't been able to do that.

What you have to realise however is that a large amount of people who are calling these lines are disabled, ill or poor and under-educated. They're normally misinformed or confused by the process and forms and genuinely need help filling them in to get benefits they're entitled to.


There are people who have nobody to help them and need things repeated a couple of times to understand them and there are people who are borderline illiterate who need forms explained to them in different terms.



And when you're boss is trying to make you cut short long calls helping an old lady with memory problems fill in a form for disability, which she needs and deserves, it's depressing every day. And when it's because of some efficiency target to save costs when the entire purpose of the institution is to help people who need it it's draconian. It's depressing and bad work conditions.


So I can see why they're complaining. I wouldn't want to do that job either and would resist it.

true,E_mE,eu,"Berlin, DE","&gt; That's simply no excuse for fucking rioting is it.

Coming from someone that clearly doesn't want to understand the deeper fabric of society, if you ignore people too much they will always eventually explode. The riots may of turned into something quite unheard of, but clearly the pressure of consumerism, the inequality in this country, the police's disregard to individuals/groups of people in areas of the country with poverty and demand on individuals to be apart of society is taking its toll. 

Now the targeting of shop keepers and old people (I like how you choose the weakest member of society for your argument here) is disturbing, but just as disturbing as the police isolating individuals and killing them, which in my eyes is even more evil as they have the power to inflict these behaviours with little to no consequences. Funny how the focus is on the innocent who suffered loss of property compared to the loss of life. Yes, the riots did cause a death of an innocent individual, which is greatly incomprehensible and the offender should be prosecuted rightfully for this heinous crime, but lets not forgot the other side, because they're JUST as important as you or me. 

&gt; Kidulthood was made by a brain dead cast, I couldn't stand it.

That just shows your true ignorance.  Not that I'm saying kidulthood is a benchmark, but it IS a way (if dramatised in parts perhaps) of life for some people, may be it fortunate or unfortunate to some, but you've got to accept it as we've all helped create this supposed vacuum through ignorance of what power can do to the weaker or unfortunate members of society. 

Large proportion of the population do suffer and the excuse of ""rioting isn't the answer"" just won't cut it, because riots are violent political statement no matter how much you have to hate to accept it. I'm neither rich nor very poor, but I sympathise with a lot of these individuals because there life's have no meaning in our society and we give very little options for anything outside of the 'market economy' or 'competitiveness', so many people exclude or isolate them because they refuse to understand.

So fuck it, why not let 'ordinary' people feel the emotions and terror of how these 'hoodlums' feel every day, even if its for just a few minutes. Funny how the response of many 'ordinary' people is hate and anger towards these individuals, exactly what they're doing in reverse, just in this case the 'hoodlums' had power for that short periods of time.

&gt; These were young people who fucked up at school, can't get jobs and now take it out on the shops who didn't employ them.

So, maybe we should think about apprenticeships eh? Or some method getting people into work and help them feel proud about there community or their personal achievements, because in school many of these individuals are told how useless they are by insecure and emotionally fucked teachers.

Secondly, the one reliable journal article (from 1968) states in the *abstract* that this particular gas sample analysis is unreliable!

It also ignores all the myriad other methods of dating rocks that use much more sophisticated techniques that have been published over the last 44 years.

is accurate. 

However, it skips over the fact that assumptions are a daily part of how we live and many assumptions can be stunningly accurate at times. For example: 

* You assume that when you sit down the chair will support you .

* That when you take a bit of cake it won't suddenly turn into an octopus, or even 

* That when you take a step you leg will remain attached to your body.  

It is also a little odd that they rubbish the 'assumptions' of generations of geologists, chemists and geographers in place of their own assumption that the Bible is entirely correct. However that may be just a little pernicity on my part...! 

Anyway, that is just my 2 cents after a long night in the bar - so no doubt a (sober) geologist will be able to take the entire article apart piece by piece!

I dont encourage, gambling and I rarely bet (seriously i maybe do it once a month if that but ill put a few bets on at that one time and rarely on football always the UFC and boxing, won money on david haye to KO Chisora in the 5th but thats another story), but because it was a tournament me and my brother said we would see who could make the most out of £50.

never said i didnt lose money, but I said at the start of the EURO id only bet money from £50, no more goes into it, use any profits if needed to bet but if it hit zero that was it. All bets were made through Ladbrokes, oh and it was Carroll to score first, wellbeck to score last, England to win. 

----------------------------

I dont *have* to explain anything at 1 am but i will. My brother picked both Pepe and Lahm as scorers, most of my bets were England/Portugal/Italy/Spain bets which is were most of the money came from. I also used more than first goalscorers alone, if i was sure i would mostly add the team to win aswell.

the more confident i was the higher the bid, i would cut bets to £7.50, 2.50, £15, £20 ect (**cant remember exact odds, cant remember exact money bets** but i finished the tournament £1095 up, brother finished £3,000+ up because he put bigger money on it and a friend made around £4,000+ but he's got problems) my step mum who works at Ladbrokes said 5 guys made over £25 grand but they were regular big winners

------------------------------------

* I got the Sweden and Ukraine 1st Goalscorers right, including Wellbeck to score last (did think it would end 2-0 England but big surprise) - I never bet against England, If I dont think they can do it I dont bet, simple. Carroll had only been getting better and better and received a lot of praise in training i took a faithful bet on him and he delivered, I also knew wellbeck was in form and thinking it would end 2-0 had him to score last, with england to win, multibet.


* I got Balotelli to score first and last against the Germans - he looked to be on form and me and my bro believed the Italians had the pace to beat the Germans, I thought it might end 2-1 Italy so Balotelli first and last goal scorer it was


* Germany to win by 3 or more against Greece - brother suggested it, he had ger to win 4-1 was gutted when it finished 4-2, I thought Germany would win 3-0

* Roni as first goalscorer against the CR - Ronaldo was looking to prove himself all tournament, I believe he is the best in the world so I put 10 on him

* spain to beat ireland by 3 or more and torres to score first - Still rate Torres as one of the best strikers in the world even if he has been playing shit and I didnt think Ireland would stand a chance, didnt bet much because I didnt know if torres would be playing when i placed bet

* Torres to win the golden boot/ ronaldo to win the golden boot - 10 bet on each at the very start, thought Ronaldo had more of a chance but I had a feeling spain would go all the way so more chances of scoring

* Spain to win - because Spain but very shit odds

and others but cant thing off the top of my head

thats not to say i didnt lose, i just managed to win more than i lost and saw anything above the 50 as profit.

I lost money on England vs Italy, first Goal scorer Rooney was 10, money on England to win, money on England to win 1-0, England to win on pens, Portugal to beat Spain, Ronaldo to score first, Ronaldo to score last, Portugal to win on pens - I know I made a bet on spain to win but I had hoped Portugal would beat them because I like how hard Ronaldo was playing and I fancied someone else winning it for a change 

-------------------------------

its not impossible to make pretty logical bets, oh Ronaldo seems to be playing well, ill have him as first goal scorer at 4/1 and Portugal to win at whatever and multibet it and ill put 20 on it

I just played it as smart as I could and it paid off, havent made a bet since the chisora fight

I don't buy the political justifications for the most part. By and large, people did what they did because they wanted some free stuff, they wanted to maim, kill, or otherwise harass ""the feds"", or they were just bored and wanted to cause a little chaos, and in all cases they thought they could get away with it.

&gt; On regards to damage to property, I find is very sad that attacks happened against corner shops and cafes, as these generally are institutions of small communities attempting to make a life for them selfs. But on regards to larger corps. where profit is always the factor over people, I have no sympathy.

I don't buy this either. Almost all of the corporations affected are publicly listed companies. Sure, at the top of many of these companies there are a handful of executives making silly money, but the profits are distributed all over the place. You probably know people who, in one way or another (savings accounts, pension funds, etc.) are dependent on the performance of these companies.

More to the point, they hire thousands of people in the affected areas. Thousands of jobs went up in smoke during the riots, many for good. You don't like JD Sports because it's an evil mega corporation? Well, through maybe two degrees of separation you probably know a dozen people employed by them.

&gt; Also I disagree with political or populist sentencing. Thats a demonstration of bias, which the justice system should not get involved with.

That's how our justice system works. Retribution is one of the many factors that determines a sentence, and in the wake of the riots, popular demand for retributive justice was extremely high.

Personally I think it's a shocking indictment of our justice system up to the point of the riots that the average person being collared and convicted already had 11 prior convictions, and was still free to roam the streets and repeat offend.",0,1344905991,null,0,false,0,c5sq02d,t3_y5wca,t1_c5sq02d,t1_c5spmtv,null,1429631138,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

What's fucking tragic is that we don't even try - that ""one can never achieve perfection"" is used as an excuse, and inequalities are piled upon inequalities. 

Almost nothing that is said about the poor is applied to those who are born rich. ""They should have to work for a living"", but not if you inherited a fortune from your family.

Fix those kinds of inequalities and I'll be with you, but the majority of the truly poor have no democratic or political representation because they know the system is bent.

------------------------------------

&gt; Second, I still don't see how what I wrote was a rant or talking down to you. You were advising someone who is asking about gambling that a certain type of bet provides better odds and that it is ""normally pretty easy to guess"" for that type of bet. That is a false statement (technically every bet is equally easy to ""guess"" but I don't think that's what you meant) and bad advice and I called you out on it.

I said you get better odds on first goal scorer, this is true. Normally pretty easy to guess, In situations and if you know both teams and players well enough, THIS IS TRUE. Im not a part time supporter, been watching/playing my whole life, I live for this stuff, not saying im a pro on everything that goes on but I KNOW MY STUFF, he may not know, but i am very confident in **MY** knowledge, im sure you have a hobby where you know the way something is going to turn out and then it does.

If you were to place a bet on Arsenal last season on who would score first, who would you pick? I know who I would pick, RVP everytime, Same with United, certain teams have certain players that are just killing it and it makes it easy to guess. Never said it would pay off every time this is what you assumed, you were wrong. 

&gt; I don't believe you on your list of betting wins. It's possible but very unlikely you pulled that off, without also have LOTS of losing bets, so I'm going to play the odds myself and call bullshit. If you, your brother and your friend all really did rake in a ton of cash, congratulations.

no, we did, really did. Really. Its not impossible, its not even really difficult, Im sure loads of times you said something like 'I think Suarez will score first hes be on form lately and hes been linking up well with Gerrard' and then he went and scored first and you thought 'if only i made a bet', maybe, maybe not, I did and do but I was willing to put money down.

So when making a bet on certain teams I said to myself 'hmmm Ronaldo seems to be on form this season, he looks like he wants that Ballon d'Or so im sure he's bound to be goal gunning, ill put a big bet on him because im confident in him and his teams ability' it paid off again and again.

This is why i dont think you even read it, I said I lost bets, I listed a bunch I lost...

Everyone who had ever made or will will lose a bet. BUT I won more than I lost, I lost maybe 300 but from the 50 i set down I had 1095 at the end of the tournament, WHICH is a profit. 

Its, not, difficult, to, understand if you have MORE money than you STARTED with, WITHOUT putting MORE money IN, You have done WELL.

&gt; I'm not saying that your Step Mom didn't say it or that people didn't win that much, just that they don't regularly win that much without also regularly taking big loses that off-set 80-90% of their winnings. That's how the best gamblers in the world operate, unless they are involved in match-fixing. If they consistently did better than that the book makers would stop taking their bets. 

Again i never said they regularly won THAT much, never said that at all all i said was they were regular big winners, return varies on the sport and input, you assumed and you assumed wrong, again. (STOP ASSUMING) Two of the guys were semi famous for a while for putting £500 on Blackburn Rovers to BEAT united which came through 3-2, they won around £25,000 then aswell. 

This time they did a Euro bet, very similar to a millionaires bet but with tournament settings, (common in the UK should check it out sometime) where you bet who goes through each group, who goes through the quarters, who goes through the semi and who wins it, not difficult not impossible, 5 guys won it. Im sure they lose a lot all the time, but when they win they win big and they dont seem to be suffering.

&gt;I said you get better odds on first goal scorer, this is true.

What do you mean by ""better odds?""  Do you mean **longer** odds?  There are no odds **better** than straight result bets.  Exotic and proposition bets are almost exclusively sucker bets.  All fair sports odds (non-sucker bets) are set with the intention of balancing risk amongst all possible outcomes so the book maker collects the vig with the least possible risk.  It usually doesn't work out that way because of the influence of ""public money"" but that's the goal of a book maker.

&gt;Normally pretty easy to guess, In situations and if you know both teams and players well enough, THIS IS TRUE.

It's extremely easy to guess.  It is NOT extremely easy to guess RIGHT.  If it were, football fans would all be rich and there wouldn't be any book makers.

&gt;but i am very confident in MY knowledge, im sure you have a hobby where you know the way something is going to turn out and then it does.

Your memory is biased towards positive outcomes.  This is a well known and much studied phenomenon amongst gamblers.

&gt;If you were to place a bet on Arsenal last season on who would score first, who would you pick? I know who I would pick, RVP everytime, Same with United, certain teams have certain players that are just killing it and it makes it easy to guess. Never said it would pay off every time this is what you assumed, you were wrong.

I'm not assuming that you think it will pay off every time; I'm taking issue with your idea that there are ""good"" bets in the long-run.  van Persie started 37 league games last season and scored first in 10 of those games.  His current odds as first scorer against Sunderland are 5/2.  While those odds would change based on opponent, I think Sunderland are a relatively average opponent so, using that as the benchmark with a £10/game bet you would have lost £120 making that bet every game that RvP started last season.  I'm sure his odds shifted as the season went on but you would almost certainly have lost money (I didn't look at the odds of each individual game), even though he had one of the best seasons of anyone in the league.  It is a sucker bet.

The rest of what you wrote is basically textbook thinking from degenerate gamblers so I am happy that you don't bet too often or for too large a sum of money, and that you have been lucky so far (though I don't actually believe you on this).  You are describing yourself as the exact type of person that a bookie would kill to take bets from.",0,1344915482,null,0,false,0,c5sshzm,t3_y56n6,t1_c5sshzm,t1_c5srj0v,null,1429632324,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,shirro,null,null,"I know Doctor Who never got much exposure in the USA due to it being on PBS or a cable network but in places like Australia or New Zealand it was almost as popular as the UK. When I was a kid in the 70s it was on tv five nights a week. And when I wasn't watching it I was likely reading Target novelisations. I remember being able to run off the names of all the companions and doctors as a little kid. 

I just can't compare Star Wars which I have seen maybe once or twice with something I grew up with every day. Doctor Who might not be iconic in the USA but it is in some other places. 

It is arguably huge in the UK and like the NHS perhaps it isn't something that translates well elsewhere. As an Australian I sort of straddle the fence on trans-atlantic culture. I never heard of Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye or Mr Rodgers before joining Reddit. I was brought up on a diet of UK tv from the likes of Monty Berman, Terry Nation, Brian Clemens and Dennis Spooner but hardly saw an original series Star Trek. There is so much great stuff that has come out of the UK. Rowling, Moore, Gibbons, Gaiman, Wright/Pegg, Nolan, Whitehouse, Moffat, Gattis, RTD, Clarke, Stross, Conan-Doyle. Doctor Who, for me, stands apart. Given the London Police Box and Daleks have become such recognisable elements of popular culture I am a little surprised they didn't get used given that they had time for Life of Brian and Mr Bean.

I think the UK has consistently failed to recognise how great Doctor Who is. In Australia we might call it a cultural cringe. They always thought the UK product was inferior to the shows coming from the US. Well it isn't.

true,cypressgroove,eng-sussex,bRightOn,"&gt;That's how our justice system works. Retribution is one of the many factors that determines a sentence, and in the wake of the riots, popular demand for retributive justice was extremely high.

Good god, you could not be more wrong or hold a more polar opposite view to the spirit of the law in this country.

Retribution is pretty much the ***LAST*** thing that is, or should be, taken into account when meting out criminal justice. It actually fucking terrifies me that there are a lot of people out there who share your view, and I know there are.

To be honest, I don't expect to change your view on here, and I don't want to argue with you because you happen to have picked up a troubling misinterpretation of criminal justice - that's society's fault for not educating you on this subject properly, not yours - so I absolutely bear you no ill will, but seriously - if you want to take the time to go read a few bits and pieces about the purpose of modern criminal justice systems I honestly think you might find yourself surprised. Both by how different it's goals are to what you perceive them to be, and also the (very good imo) reasons *why* it is set up the way it is.

Or I should say '*was*' because as you so rightly pointed out - this whole fiasco was a terrifying shift away from nonpolitical criminal justice in this country. It scares me.",0,1344919184,null,0,false,0,c5stf03,t3_y5wca,t1_c5stf03,t1_c5sq02d,null,1429632793,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Where do they get this from? It's possibly dwindled in recent years, but I wouldn't go anywhere near close to saying ""all-but-vanished."" From what I've seen and experienced (from the actions of many unionist MLAs), a large part of modern unionist ideology is to, at worst, refuse to recognise any notion of 'Irishness' in Northern Ireland, and at best, belittle it. One only needs to go on many of the DUP's Twitter feeds to find them bashing Irish culture. 

Surely that still hints at a strong siege mentality, since they lack the confidence in the Belfast agreement to be able to stand any notion of Irishness in 'their' country without it being respected or belittled? Surely this suggests they still fear the cultural link that many northerners share with the rest of the island, as if it's encroaching on 'their' 'territory' and will ultimately lead to unity. That's the definition of siege-mentality to me. Feel the Telegraph may be putting a slant on things here.

That article shows its UK misunderstanding of the US political scene.

Unlike the UK, the US is not split along rich/poor lines politically in as narrow a manner as the UK is. Social concerns often trump fiscal ones.

A Hispanic or African-American is just as likely to vote Republican because of their culturally conservative backgrounds. It was one of George Bush's rare political insight that led him to target Hispanics especially and which helped him win two elections.

FTFY. The use you put your money to is immaterial. Many of the parents of kids at my school put almost everything they had into their kids' education, foregoing holidays etc.

Let me ask you a question: Would you consider a quarter of a million pound inheritance a rich, or large sum?

I suspect the answer is ""yes"" - but anyone who owns a house has assets currently valued at between £100k and £400k depending on where they live and how house prices have spiralled in that area.

After a relative kicking off, having (say) a 40k inheritance is not uncommon, and is not unlikely. And yes, my family are extremely working class (dad works in a car factory, mum works for social services).

1 hour month season ticket= £338.70 
30 mins month season=£364.80 

 But what really annoys me is that public transport should be there for people who need to travel out to work but cannot afford a car, a good alternative (or for helping kids go to college/unis outside thier area). Found out in county bus service aren't great for going out of the area and trains are too expensive for some. Surely cheaper ticket option would help lil in lessening unemployment rates since people can have wider area to look for jobs.

true,cypressgroove,eng-sussex,bRightOn,"Okay there's a very quick way to put that idea to bed if you don't want to do the reading I suggested. :)

All sentencing guidelines for the courts of this country are matters of public record, what the judges read - you can read too.

Now, if you can find me one single example in any one of those which instructs a judge to take into account how pissed off the crime made society or the victim, I'll happily concede the point. I'll warn you now, though - I've read all of them and it's not there. You're obviously welcome to try though. :)

The in-a-nutshell answer as to *why* they're not there is because we surpassed the stage of a retributive legislature in this country round about the time people started accepting that 'an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind'. 

A more detailed answer would require a bit of discussion about the legal concept of mens rea (from the phrase *actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea* which means *the act does not make a person guilty unless the mind is also guilty*) and the difficulties and complications that brings to the justice system.

Finally consider what you're actually saying remembering that *people do not prosecute other people of* criminal *charges in this country - it's ALWAYS the state vs the defendant*. So the only way you could measure how much 'retribution' would be appropriate would be if there were more state resources necessary to secure any given conviction relative to convicting someone else of the same crime. That would make severity of punishment dependant on factors the criminal has absolutely no control over. Are you suggesting it would be fair for one murderer to get five years and the other ten just because one required the use of expensive DNA evidence and the other didn't? How about one getting more years than another because one murdered a tramp and the other a lord? It's absurdities like that you can't avoid if you start down the slippery slope of quantifying sentencing based upon a retributive principle, and *that* is one of the many reasons we left that barbaric practice behind. 

HTH :)

::edit:: Note that there's a reason I keep asking you to do the groundwork here - it's because you made the claim that sentencing is partly retributive in the UK, and I am simply refuting that claim. As the person who made the claim, this means the burden of proof lies with you to support that assertion. FYI my 'source' for all this is that I was an IT director for a law firm for three years, I've sat through this exact discussion countless times in pubs and restaurants with any number of barristers, solicitors, paralegals, you name it, and they were the onles who educated me, I used to believe what you did too, hence why I absolutely would never blame you or think less of you for believing it. :)",0,1344938331,null,0,1344938913,0,c5swgok,t3_y5wca,t1_c5swgok,t1_c5swaao,null,1429634268,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Also, as for it being *short lived* [Reeves Furniture Store](http://www.houseofreeves.com/riot/i60) lost a 140 year old building and a year on are still trying to rejuvinate the area.

I'll be honest. I didn't watch the show on the anniversary. I'm not going to watch it on i-player. I'm not a middle-class rich bird (some of whom ended up in court at least over it) and I do know what it's like to grow up poor. I remember there being times when I was a kid when my Mum didn't eat so that there was enough food for us kids. There was nothing to do in our area, we lived then (and do now) in an area officially designated as poverty stricken. Education in this area isn't great and round here... there was only a single half-hearted attempt to break into a shopping centre, which was dispersed when McDonalds threatened to close if they didn't go away.

Yes, the Police officers you mentioned should be punished.

The Libor thing (which I don't entirely get tbh &amp; am not asking for it to be explained) sounds bad and wrong and if someone has broken a law then I fully support them being sent to prison.

Don't get me started on parliamentary scandal - I have strong views on the entire Government System which include that it's entirely corrupt, it always has been corrupt &amp; if Guido Fawkes were around today, whilst murdering people to get your point is never a good plan, I'd have campaigned for his sentence to be commuted.

**However**, that doesn't justify the riots. From what I read about them at the time. It was an any excuse to cause trouble kind of thing - with no forethought, and no benefit.

The entire episode was an embarrasment and whatever the rioters say, there can be no excuses. They didn't highlight a problem (if they had there would be no debate about causality) they didn't make anything better and more importantly they punished the wrong people.

I'm not saying that they should be punished more harshly than the  NoTW hacks (who should be punished, I agree). What I am saying is that you can't say ""group of people A who commited crime 1 have yet to be properly punished and appear to have got away with it scott free, therefore group of people B who commited crime 2 and have nothing at all to do with group of people A or crime 1, should also not be punished and get away scott free"".

What we should be saying is ""group of people A who commited crime 1 haven't been punished. we should totally fix that and make sure it that they are punished appropriately.""

true,gooneruk,cnty-england,London,"I was at Clapham Junction on the night of the riots, and the BBC used some of my footage in last night's documentary, and even gave me a credit at the end of the programme.

I wrote this in [another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/vy2nw/did_anyone_experience_the_2011_riots_first_hand/c58tjq9) about the riots a few months back, but it got buried, so here it is again. There's no commentary on the causes, just my experiences on the night itself.

STARTS:

I was in Clapham Junction on the main night of rioting there. Got there whilst there were still some police (in riot gear) around, and before any shops got broken into. I was stood on [this junction](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=The+Falcon,+Saint+John%27s+Hill,+London,+United+Kingdom&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.463753,-0.167826&amp;spn=0.00258,0.004501&amp;sll=51.463777,-0.167&amp;sspn=0.00258,0.004501&amp;oq=the+falcon&amp;hq=The+Falcon,&amp;hnear=St+John%27s+Hill,+London,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=m&amp;fll=51.463586,-0.168394&amp;fspn=0.00258,0.004501&amp;z=18) for the start of the rioting, and then went down St John's Road as the attention shifted there.

I took my video camera with me, and you can see some of my HD footage on Vimeo. You'll also see a chunk of it (including some not on Vimeo) on a BBC2 documentary later this month, called ""RIOTS: IN THEIR OWN WORDS: PART ONE: THE RIOTERS"".

The crowd was pretty big, I'd say more than a thousand people and most looked to be in an age range between 14-18. Most of the bystanders and onlookers were older, from mid-20s through to about 40. The racial make-up amongst the crowd was heavily black and mixed race, which is a reflection of the estates in the Clapham/Battersea area, in my experience.

After about half an hour of some relatively fruitless attacks on the JD Sports, attention switched to the big Debenhams on the corner. It got broken into, and people were in/out non-stop, grabbing mostly jewellery, watches and some clothes.

At this point, the police completely abandoned the area. They were originally in a line across St John's Road, preventing the crowd from going further down that main shopping street. The only shops being attacked at that stage were on the corner: Debenhams and JD Sports.

You can see in my video Ransacking Debenhams how the police retreated and then dispersed in cars/vans, leaving the street completely unprotected. Until that point, there had been no damage done to 99% of the shops in Clapham Junction.

Obviously, all hell then broke loose.

The crowd moved down St John's Road, attacking various shops. I stayed up on the corner for a while, because the crowd was still big there, and there were a few shops getting smashed in there anyway. The zoom on my camera's pretty decent, so I got some good footage.

Trainers and sports gear were a big draw, and I lost count of the number of Foot Locker bags that I saw. Some people couldn't wait to get back home, and so were putting on multiple jumpers/jackets right there and then. I was amused at how many had bothered to take coathangers too.

My favourite moment was seeing one lad come back out of Debenhams, cross the road and go up to two girls. The first of the girls looked at his bags and his hands full of stuff, and said to him (really loudly) ""What you got for me then?!"" It was a touching moment, truly...

Another good sight was seeing a guy walking away from Currys with some kind of ipod dock stereo system in a box, some other electronic device also in a box, and then, perched on top, an extension multiplug. That's some good robbing, right there. A practical thief.

I then moved down St John's Road, filming as I went and getting a bit more up close and personal. At times, I had to keep my camera hidden from view, or shooting quite literally from the hip, as a number of rioters were getting aggressive towards those taking pictures or filming. I saw a number of people running away at full sprint, being chased by a couple of rioters.

It was interesting to see which shops got attacked and ransacked. Currys was absolutely gutted, whereas the Waterstones practically next door didn't have a scratch. Likewise the Jamie Oliver deli place, whereas TK Maxx was nigh-on empty.

I made a list on my phone at the time of which places had been attacked, and it was about 50-items long. And that didn't include a few others on St John's Hill, which I didn't see until later on.

Things were starting to fade out a little by then, and all the talk amongst the rioters was ""Where's next?"". Phones were out constantly, and were either glued to ears or had fingers flying across. I can't say whether Blackberrys were the most common, as I didn't notice. It wasn't until reading news reports the next day that I heard about BBM organising everything.

Everyone was talking about Stockwell or Brixton as the next destination, but I wasn't up for following the crowd, and headed back to the station to go home. There, I saw about 4 police at the main entrance, I guess stopping people who looked like rioters. They were the first police I'd seen for about 3 hours.

When I got home, I flicked on the news and saw that the party shop on the junction was now up in flames, something I must've missed by a matter of minutes. There hadn't been any fires until then, just smashed windows and wrecked shop interiors.

Right, that's my take on it. A long write, and hopefully a worthwhile read.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"Since we are speculating on Sahin, it is only fair to include the other rumours regarding Tello and Dempsey, and that of Adam going as a makeweight for Dempsey. Firstly, Sahin will be joining the likes of Gerrard, Henderson, Adam, Lucas, Allen, Shelvey and Spearing. That makes 8 players for 3 positions. Now it is widely accepted that Spearing is not good enough and should only be played as a backup in the most desperate of situations. That makes 7. Now Shelvey and Henderson are likely to be backups for Gerrard, whose fitness is suspect. That leaves 4. If Adam leaves, that makes 3 players fighting for 2 positions. Henderson can play as a distributor, but isn't that good defensively. Both Sahin and Allen are good distributors who ate adept defensively. Lucas is a defensive player who is adept in distribution. This gives us options, especially since we don't know if Lucas' might have become more frail after his injury.

Two things to consider. 1, almost all rumours point towards Sahin coming on loan. The good thing about having a player on loan is that you aren't as obligated to play him all the time. If his wages are high, we will likely be paying only a certain percentage of it. If they are low, well that's okay. Either way, there isn't too much financial cost. If he doesn't turn out well for us, then he's going back to Madrid anyway. If he does do well, we can consider signing him next season, or try to negotiate a cheap deal for Alonso next year. 

2, transfer deals are never considered in isolation with each other. The Sahin deal might be dependent on Adam moving in exchange for Dempsey. Real might be less likely to loan Sahin out now that Alonso has rejected a new contract, especially if they don't get Modric.

&gt; (1) Any court dealing with an offender in respect of his offence must have regard to the following purposes of sentencing— (a) the punishment of offenders, (b) the reduction of crime (including its reduction by deterrence), (c) the reform and rehabilitation of offenders, (d) the protection of the public, and (e) the making of reparation by offenders to persons affected by their offences.

The principle of retributive justice comes under (a) and, indirectly, (b) as well.

&gt; The in-a-nutshell answer as to why they're not there is because we surpassed the stage of a retributive legislature in this country round about the time people started accepting that 'an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind'.

We haven't. Restorative justice is used in some cases (community punishment, etc.), and we have provision for mitigating circumstances (mental illness, etc.) but the principle of retribution remains a cornerstone of justice in this country.

There are still many cases in which retributive justice is the primary concern. Consider the life sentence. To quote the Ministry of Justice website:

&gt; Instead, such prisoners must serve a minimum period of imprisonment to meet the needs of retribution and deterrence.

&gt; [...] Where the trial judge has decided that the requirements of retribution and deterrence can be satisfied only by prisoners remaining in prison for the rest of their lives, the trial judge will not set a minimum term of imprisonment and these prisoners are not eligible for a Parole Board review or release.

In the grand scheme of things, barely anyone died in the episode, and even if the 0.5 billion£ estimated cost (nation wide) was correct that's probably equal to the hospitalities at the Olympics.

&gt; However, that doesn't justify the riots.

Again why can't people understand the difference between causation and justification? There is no such thing as mindless violence, but trying to sweep a complex event away with that label is unhelpful. It means at any time for no reason impoverished areas can burst into rioting. Anyone can see that is an unsatisfactory explanation, so we have to look deeper, yet when people do just that they start getting beat down (softly from you in this case): how dare you try and justify this!

If you want to understand the riots then you probably need to understand racism in the police, EMA having been taken away, the LIBOR scandal, the so called 'credit crunch', organised sports (and how that encourages tribalism), corruption in politics, and the endless media induced desire for consumer products. A section of society is deliberately taught to act irrationally, to act on impulse, to buy on impulse, to be seduced by the hollow emotion of advertising and branding. As a society we have decided that success is the clothes you wear, the price tag on your car and the size of your flat screen TV.

&gt; The entire episode was an embarrasment and whatever the rioters say, there can be no excuses. They didn't highlight a problem (if they had there would be no debate about causality) they didn't make anything better and more importantly they punished the wrong people.

This sentence is a little odd. The problem is socio-economic break down where people cannot articulate precisely what is wrong. The expectation of some reasoned debate is a bit silly. If you treat dogs badly and have them grow up in a poor environment they will behave badly, and at present we effectively cage a large section of society in poor housing and a terribly destructive anti-culture. These areas are largely stripped of self direction and are supposed to be happy with a 40 hr a week job (if they can get it) on minimum wage, perhaps stacking shelves or being an unpaid 'volunteer' somewhere. Meanwhile these people get to see stories like the Queen getting a pay-rise and record bonuses.

true,Swooshington,1953,,"For me Mikel isn't a good enough holding midfielder. He came to us as a more advanced midfielder, and has always reeked of square peg round hole. The guy is similar to Meireles in the sense he isn't really defensive enough to be the ball winning midfielder we need, or dynamic enough to be the box to box player we need. He doesn't offer enough of an all round game to impose himself on most fans.

If we take some examples to support my point. Take Claude, Essien or Mascherano. These are the typical, tenacious, battling defensive midfielder, of which Mikel isn't. This is the type most Chelsea fans (I assume) feel we need, as it really would suit the football we want to see. Then you have the Pirlo, Alonso or Xavi type deep lying midfielder. They have less emphasis on defensive duties, with their passing and vision the key to unlocking attacks on the break. Sadly Mikel doesn't really offer anywhere near that range of passing. Mikel reminds me a lot of Busquets. The issue there is Busquets has Xavi, Cesc and Iniesta to feed, who all perform the necessary jobs to keep the team ticking over. Lamps is no Xavi, Rambo is no Iniesta, and thus Mikel is not really suited to our perceived style. Is he a tower of shit? No. Is he what we need? No. Is he what we have? Yes, so until we replace him we need to find a system that suits him, as well as the other players at out disposal.

Having viewers is not the same as having quality TV. Americans are always commenting on how British TV series are so short. In reality their series are so long because they double the number of episodes to squeeze more ad time out efficiently. A direct situation where an inferior product is being created to milk advertisement money.

So Britain tends to get consistent series. They are either good or junk usually. If they are good then they are all worth watching. Americans tend to be held captive by their shows.

American broadcasters tend to do exactly what I just said. Make great shows then add in an extra 5-10 episodes that don't need to exist. There are exceptions like Game of Thrones (mainly because it is based on a book). The perfect example of the gap between good and great is Babylon 5 season 4. They cancelled season 5 originally so JMS packed all the season 5 content into season 4. So you got a zero filler season 4 that blew the previously solid B5 into the high heavens. If B5 was done in the UK it'd have 5 years of 10 episode runs with no filler. It'd all look like season 4 but in smaller doses. No pointless episodes that needn't exist for any reason other than ads.

American shows have done this forever. They need to do something great to get a crowd but they hold them there through pointless ad episodes. It isn't even realistically debatable that this happens.

&gt; Note, as I said, there is absolutely nothing in there about how society feels about the crime or how the victim's family feels about the crime

I don't see how this is relevant? The CPS aren't the ones sentencing offenders, and those guidelines are not an exhaustive list of the factors that might determine a person's sentence.

&gt; She made the severity of sentencing political, not judicial, which is why so many were later overturned or reduced, incidentally. ;) The principle at stake is whether someone stealing a 79p bottle of water should get a heavier sentence because it was a crime the public was particularly annoyed about. Ms. May seems to think so - the litany of judges and lawyers and the legislation on the books would strenuously disagree (thank god). :)

The criminal justice system is designed to take popular opinion into account, and that's no bad thing. The CPS decide whether to pursue a criminal prosecution based on whether it is in the public interest to do so. Sentencing is based on the interests of the general public (its safety, desire for a reduction in crime, for reparation, and also, retribution). The views and interests of the general public are of paramount importance throughout.

The general public, I think it's fair to say, were disgusted by the actions of the rioters. Judges sentencing those involved, generally speaking, recognised the desire for punishment was high, and the need for a deterrent was significant, so passed harsher sentences as a result.

Six: His arrogance and severe violations against fashion, being unable to have a normal conversation at all without Evelyn around to keep him in check.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"On the topic of privatization, there probably are inefficiencies which arise from the artificial market structure which has been put in place. But it seems to me the major process which is occuring is rather different: that the cost of train transport is being transferred away from the taxpayer, and onto the people who actually use the trains, and I personally think this is sensible and fair.

Train transport has an underlying cost, just like any other form of transport, and there's no particular reason why it should be hidden from view, in the same way that road users should pay for the upkeep of the roads. This should be the case for a number of reasons. 

First, it is fair; railways work best for high density point to point services, so it's unsurprising that money to run the service goes disproportionately to supply those needs, for intercity transport, and for commuting into and out of major cities. But a lot of the population do not live in these circumstances and do not require these services. It is perverse to expect a farmer in the Highlands or someone living and working in a small market town to pay out a section of their wages to subsidize someone elses daily fare into and out of the major cities.

Second, it is sensible, because railway providers should be earning their money and targeting their investment at services which compete with other forms of transport. If you're going into and out of London, the train is exceptional, a lot easier than dealing with road congestion, perhaps cheaper than paying the congestion charge, and without the hassle of having to find parking. But I could go every morning to commuter trains where people are packed in like sardines, and this has been going on for 15 years. They are not limited by the line capacity, but because there isn't the money to pay for extending platforms to take longer trains, nor for buying extra stock. They should increase fares, and use the money to provide a better service, to increase passenger capacity, and take strain off the roads. They don't because their incentives are not set up correctly.

I probably would give up the futile private franchise system, and bring it back under arms-length public control, but only on the basis that it should be run like any other service, guided primarily by supply and demand.

Edit: Not sure I'm correct, looking at the data. The cost increases have accompanied increased subsidy, although most of it seems to be being spent on infrastructure. See my post above, with the comparison to Sweden and Germany.

Encouraging yet more onto an already crowded system is not what they want. The trains are crowded and they can bump up the prices, lowering them is not in their interests. 

However- off peak services are very seldom as busy as peak services and are a lot cheaper, to encourage you off of the peak trains and onto the lighter loaded journeys. They are free to raise peak fares as much as they want, so long as they lower another ticket by the same amount. So those travelling peak are often subsidising off peak travel. 

When travelling myself, I tend to be as flexible as possible, arrive into London after 11, leave after 8pm for an hour journey, the walk up fare is £25 with advance ones I've had before being as cheap as £11.  Another tip is don't use the trainline.com , awful UI and a booking fee. Londonmidland.co.uk is well laid out, no booking fee and shows every ticket, not just their own.

Yes I've heard the 'fifth most spoken language in the world'.  The vast majority of people that speak French are in countries that are close to being failed states; e.g. Central African Republic.  Senegal is not too bad and is one place that has potential.  However English is the language Senegalese youth learn to get ahead in life.  There is no French equivalent of America, Australia, New Zealand.  No one wants to learn French to improve their lives.  It's Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Arabic and English.  France would do well to learn from the Germans and Dutch and think about the future rather than the past.  I suppose there is a large Arabic speaking population in France though so this is good for business and international trade.
I am very optimistic about the UK.  We attract investment and people want to come here to work.  We function as the USA of Europe - people want to learn English and to earn money in London.

As a British Muslim, it's a tough situation. On the one hand, I love the fact that Muslims are becoming more devout and serious by their faith. However, it seems to me like most of society is becoming more ""progressive"", modern, liberal. So it seems like society as a whole is moving away from the middle ground, which can not be good for tensions and social cohesion. For instance, we've got a large movement in society saying that same-sex marriage should be illegal. Yet 61% of Muslims say that homosexuality itself should be illegal. It's two extreme opposites. And with increasing numbers and political influence of Muslims, I think we are going to call for more power and to live under our own laws. So I really don't know how it is going to work.

true,cypressgroove,eng-sussex,bRightOn,"&gt;I don't see how this is relevant? The CPS aren't the ones sentencing offenders, and those guidelines are not an exhaustive list of the factors that might determine a person's sentence.

*sigh* Okay, so we're going to play the semantics games are we? 

You *do* know there's sometimes a difference between being right and winning, and that there was a chance for us both to have both just now, yes? 

So, I guess we'll put a pin in that for a moment and move on:

First point: it's pretty disingenuous to link me earlier to a public-facing website which had absolutely nothing to do with specific sentencing guidelines to support your own point then complain when I don't link you to the actual PDF **that I already told you that you can find for yourself on the sentencing council site** which *is* the exhaustive list you're now claiming you want. Let me make this really clear: *I asked you earlier to go read those guidelines in full and you wouldn't* (or you did and found they didn't support your argument, who can tell which one?) If you are going to insist upon exact sources and not the ones we've been using up until now - go find and read those sources. It's not going to be as quick as that overview I linked you to, but feel free.

Second you make this unsupported claim: ""*The criminal justice system is designed to take popular opinion into account, and that's no bad thing*"" - Now, I'm sorry but that's so wrong it's not even funny but to be honest now we've established that nothing short of me telling the world you're right when you're not is going to satisfy you I think that instead of me continuing to try to move this towards a constructive discussion to find some middle ground as I have been doing until now (and been spurned) I'm going to simply say this: you know where the guidelines are, you have a browser and an agenda: go prove it. Go find that directive to judges that they should take into account public *opinion* when deciding the severity of a sentence and show everyone here how *right* you've been all along. I'll happily capitulate when you do. You're not going to find it, but have fun! 

&gt; so passed harsher sentences as a result.
That's life. Sucks to be a criminal.

...which were almost universally overturned or reduced to the appropriate sentences after the fact. That's life. Sucks to be a weak judge or interfering home secretary too I guess.

The railway will lose that clientele very quickly to the coach/car. Business travellers who do the 9-5 don't have much alternative, they have to pay the fares. In my opinion the formula for increases has been around in a similar form since privatisation. Complaints are now only coming in due to the various office types who work in London, now that their wages aren't increasing above the rate of the fares they're moaning. 

I honestly can not see a solution, people want investment and want their overcrowded train to be cheaper which also encourages even more people on to the trains whilst lessening the funds available for new infrastructure/carriages.

true,[deleted],null,null,"There simply is no exhaustive list of factors that determine a sentence. You produced a list of sentencing guidelines and said ""there is absolutely nothing in there about how society feels about the crime or how the victim's family feels about the crime""

That's great, but it's meaningless because, as I pointed out, it is not an exhaustive list. Ultimately, popular opinion (including a desire for retribution) is factored into sentencing. We saw it happen in the riots sentencing. It happens, to a lesser extent, each and every day in our courts.

A brief look at the Criminal Justice Act, which describes clearly the purposes of sentencing in criminal cases, and lists the punishment of offenders amongst them, will confirm that. The Ministry of Justice puts it in even clearer terms referring to ""the requirements of retribution and deterrence"" in relation to life sentences.

Where do you think the guidelines sentences in the link you provided come from? Part of it is out of concern for the rehabilitation of offenders and safety of the public, but ultimately we lock people away for *x* years for *y* offence because we, as a society, have deemed that to be an appropriate and proportional punishment. That's retributive justice.

Sure, judges are given a degree of autonomy in handing down sentences, and in some cases popular opinion is tempered (e.g. capital punishment), but the justice system absolutely, categorically does not operate in isolation from popular opinion.

If people were being sentenced to life imprisonment for littering, there would be uproar, and the sentencing would change in response to popular opinion.

&gt; Second you make this unsupported claim: ""The criminal justice system is designed to take popular opinion into account, and that's no bad thing"" - Now, I'm sorry but that's so wrong it's not even funny [...]

I'm utterly lost here. Are you actually claiming the criminal justice system in in the UK is *not* designed to take popular opinion into account? 

&gt; ...which were almost universally overturned or reduced to the appropriate sentences after the fact. That's life. Sucks to be a weak judge or interfering home secretary too I guess.

The narrative at Chelsea was set from early on - here is a very successful team, with a very wealthy owner and a lot of resources at its disposal who just hired the best upcoming manager in the world, our expectations are further greatness.

So from the first press conference the questions were rolling about how AVB and Chelsea would define success. After a loss or two the journalists were measuring him up against that expectation and he was failing, which only made the pressure worse.

This way, with low expectations, you don't give the media and the public a measuring stick which they can place up against Rodgers after a few games. The narrative is about starting new and fresh, and building up. Rodgers can build his experience in the top end of a top league at the same pace and at the same time as the club and squad being rebuilt.

I think it is refreshing. It was different with Kenny since he had been there before, but we have done really well in cutting Rodgers some breathing space within which he can do his work.

Not a sentiment I actually thought that I'd hear. We didn't need peoples livlihoods to be destroyed to show that the country was broken - some of us already knew that &amp; campaigns for change have always been slow (the Womens Suffrage movement took over 100 years). Rioting is never the answer and regardless of anything else that is an astoundingly heartless and appalling attitude to have.

Besides which they didn't highlight a socio-economic break down or people like [Laura Johnson](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-18203338) wouldn't have been involved.
It's not necesarily a race issue either - although predominantly male &amp; under 20's the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-18203338) show a breakdown, which shows the offenders by ethnic origina by region - it shows (when worked out for ALL areas) there is a roughly equal split of black (33%) and white (34%) with Asian, mixed and other making up the difference.

Even as an adult, there were weeks when I had £5 for food for the entire week and it would NEVER have occured to me to go rioting.

I couldn't afford to go to college at that time, I didn't get any assistance and I started working before there *was* a minimum wage.

I know you're enjoying this, but:

* NBC have up to 6 broadcast channels to run sports content on. The cable environment doesn't provide any option to broadcast any more on-demand, unlike the completely digital multiplex-based system we have worked hard to provide in the UK
* The broadcast channels are competing with a lot of other sports going on, to an audience who are not familiar with many Olympic sports or the athletes involved. Of course they are going to push their teams on the very small amount of broadcast space they have available
* They also ran programmes with a lot of regular sports and news presenters, to avoid scaring off the views. These: a) With their entourages are probably the majority of the 2500 people they sent over, b) Seem to also have little knowledge of these non-American sports, and c) Resulted in a lot of the crap ceremony/studio pieces that people are complaining about. The majority of event commentary was provided by ex-olympic athletes, and was much higher quality.
* What they did with the opening ceremony (cut to Phelps interview) was inexcusable
* The tape delay of 'popular' events to primetime television was also exceedingly poor, but obviously a requirement to advertise against
* NBC streamed every event online live (except the US-centric events delayed to primetime). This was indeed everything provided by the host broadcaster, which was up to 56 channels - more than the BBC were providing on the red button, and probably identical to what they were providing on the web.
* Editing/Vision mixing of events was done by the host broadcaster (OBS). They were the ones who switched away from the Korean handshake, for example.
* Cable providers are bastards, and required that they would only run NBC content, if any online versions could only be watched by people who could prove they were cable subscribers.
* NBC paid a significant amount towards the games, as opposed to more cost from taxes
* If NBC didn't have the US rights, sadly of the other American broadcasters would have done exactly the same.

Because, as I have said, Muslims will want the legal system to reflect their own views. This can only be done 2 ways - either the law of the nation changes to reflect more Islamic views, or Muslims are somehow allowed to self-govern within the nation.

For example, here is a scenario for you:

- A devoutly Muslim community exists.

- An advertising firm wants to place a billboard in the middle of the Muslim community. 
The billboard shows a sexy woman in a bikini.

- The Muslim community strongly oppose the billboard.

- However, the billboard is (by UK standards) legal.

So what happens in this situation? Here are the possible solutions:

- Bikini billboards are made illegal in the WHOLE country. Not going to happen!)

- Bikini billboards are made illegal in THAT particular community

- The government takes no action. The billboard is placed. A few hours later a group of Muslims tear it down and destroy it. Tensions flare, riots etc. (bad outcome)

All the talk of sentencing guidelines is moot because a judge or magistrate is concerned first and foremost with the five purposes of sentencing put forth by the Criminal Justice Act. Sentencing guidelines are derived from these purposes, but judges and magistrates also refer back to the purposes themselves when sentencing offenders.

The first of those purposes is punishment, which embodies society's desire for retribution. To quote the Sentencing Council, the body which promotes greater consistency in sentencing:

&gt; **the punishment of offenders**

&gt; This shows society’s unhappiness with the offence committed. Punishment can include loss of, or restrictions to, a person’s liberty or the payment of a fine.

— http://sentencingcouncil.judiciary.gov.uk/sentencing/what-sentences-for.htm

Ultimately, when a judge or magistrate passes a sentence, they are conscious that one of the purposes of a sentence is to punish the offender, and the degree of punishment that they give is, at least in part, determined by popular opinion. 

Popular opinion not only establishes the minimum and maximum punishments for a given offence through legislation, but also guides judges and magistrates in conferring punishments within that range.

Society was particularly unhappy with the offences committed during the riots, so judges and magistrates threw the book at the offenders concerned.

* Buying tickets - If you're going on National Express, there usually aren't ticket offices, you buy online and bring a print-out or electronic ticket, which is checked by the driver as you get on.

* The station itself - a bus station is just a place to sit, with tarmaced bays. Sometimes coach stops have no infrastructure at all, they're just a place where the bus stops on the side of the road. Train stations are far more bespoke, requiring very careful design, many line switches to redirect trains according to preset patterns, and complicated signalling equipment. Which goes on to:

* Safety - the safety margin with rail infrastructure is far lower; if a switch or a piece of signalling fails to operate, the first you'll know about it is some catastrophic failure. There is no equivalent with roads; if there are potholes, people drive around them; if traffic lights stop working; people work out a temporary way to function in the meantime. That means there is far less need for double and triple checking.

* Multiple uses of intermediate infrastructure - National Express don't have to build their own roads, they are used for an almost infinite variety of other journeys than just London to Southampton, and cross-subsidized on that basis. Clearly the rail lines which are used to go from Southampton to London are also used for other journeys, but only in a fairly limited sense. The network effect is much stronger with road, not least because the equivalent of transfers from one line to another are much easier.

* Flexibility of service provision - National Express might run a particular service, and then they can easily trial a slightly different one to see if it's more popular, they can change the location of their stops, they can run completely new line geometries, and they can stop running unprofitable and unused lines without compunction.

And when we factor in the cost of road tax, MOT, insurance, any repair costs as well as the price of the car itself - how much does it come to then? 

&gt; There is going to be a major shift to cars which drive themselves over the next 20 years.

Which is fine, except I'll be a significant way through my working life in 20 years. What about *now*? To say nothing of any issues with material / fuel shortages in 20 years time... self driving cars alone will not solve the problem. 

&gt; This will eliminate traffic and cause commuting times to half.

How? There will still be the same number of cars on the road (presumably). Will the difference in who is behind the wheel really be that significant? 

&gt; This along with electric / hybrid powered cars will really end the days of mass transit systems. 

Perhaps, but that power has to come from somewhere - then there's storage for all those vehicles (especially in congested areas). If all those people taking trains suddenly get cars, where do the cars go?

Since you've not been in the UK long, you need to start building one up.

By doing this you demonstrate that you can manage your finances and your risk profile is greatly reduced. Consequently, lenders are more willing to take a punt on you and offer you access to better housing and preferential interest rates. 

Be careful of taking out too many financial products requiring a credit check at once. By doing so you reduce your credit score since you come across as being desperate.

Nathan Fillion once was quoted talking about one of his favorite fan encounters (if i'm not mistaken) and he recalled it that he was just walking down a sidewalk or something, and a stranger saluted him, said ""cap'n"" and walked on.

Alonso/Khedira combine for, on average, 2.2 key passes per game, 134.3 passes per game, 0.8 crosses, 11 accurate long balls, and 0.7 accurate through balls. Over their entire season, they combined for 9 goals and 12 assists.

Lampard by himself has 1.8 key passes per game, 0.9 crosses, 3.5 accurate long balls and 0.4 accurate through balls. Him and Mikel have about 87 passes together, significantly lower than Madrid's duo. Lampard had 16 goals and 8 assists. My point is that Lampard almost single handedly trumps Madrid's double pivot.

Is Mikel the best CDM around? No, because as many people criticize him, he doesn't add that much to our attack. But what we can't see is how much he allows other players in the team to get into the attack. If him sitting back and being extremely defensively responsible means Lampard can play to his full potential at CM, then that's what his job should be. There's other players in the squad that benefit from this I'm sure, especially our fullbacks as we have proper cover for them. Compare to Barca who has Busquets making runs into the box along with their attacking fullbacks, which leave them defensively vulnerable as we exposed last season.

There's also the point that Mikel doesn't add much going forward because we simply don't play through him.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"I managed to find a comparison between the train services in Germany, Sweden and the UK [here](http://www.transguide.org/SWoPEc/CTS2011-19.pdf), which has some quite interesting data:

* On page 13, they give comparative fare prices per km, in Euro cents:


                    Long Distance     Regional
          Britain        10.7           8.1
          Sweden         10.8           11.7
          Germany        9.9            7.6
Britain has approximately comparable fares to Germany, and somewhat lower fares than Sweden (which you'd expect given Sweden's population density).

* On page 11, they give taxpayer subsidy per passenger km, in Euro cents:

          Britain        0.10           
          Sweden         0.18        
          Germany        0.12       
So Britain has the lowest subsidy of the three nations.

* On page 9, there's data for taxpayer subsidy, which shows a very significant increase in Britain from 1997-2007, more than 250% over that period, which is quite shocking. But it seems that the increase has come from extra spending on improving the infrastructure, from £1500m in 1997 to £3800m in 2007, whereas the remaining 'support to services' has decreased from £700m to £600m. So the increase could be because the infrastructure was not being upgraded when it was being run publicly, under previous conservative governments.

* On page 14, they give fare increase rates 1997-2007:

                               Sweden, Britain, Germany,

        Inflation (CPI)         3.1      3.8       1.5
        Local public transport  5.5      4.2       3.9
        Long distance rail      3.2      6.6       2.4
Long distance fares have grown more quickly in Britain, but from above, they have basically just grown to parity with other European services. And local services are growing more slowly than in both other countries,  taking inflation into account.

* Also on page 14, they give growth rates for how much people are using rail, over the period from 1997-2007. British use of rail increased at the fastest rate, at 3.5% a year, then Sweden at 2.6%, and Germany far lower at 0.9%. That means that British use of rail increased 40% over that period, which is impressive. Although they say that's unlikely to have anything to do with privatization.

So, according to this paper, the British service is rather good, certainly roughly comparable with Germany and Sweden. Assuming I read the data correctly, anyway. Also, to head off any element of bias, read the abstract; the paper is not generally in favour of the privatization approach, and says that the British programme of breaking up the service has not yielded better results than Germany sticking with its more 'vertically orientated' approach (meaning a more unified, monolithic public rail organization).

Someone who is not just limited to defensive responsibilities. While your argument remains valid that Lampard can make up for Mikel's shortcomings in attack, it's not necessarily wise (nor fair) to depend on Lamps to carry that load game in and game out. Not to mention Lamps is obviously getting on in age, and can't be counted on for much longer. To say we dont play through Mikel isnt entirely accurate either. We've all seen the ball come to Mikel in counter attacking moments (and regular attack build-ups) and he has been less than impressive, and often stifled the attack. Having a more versatile player in Mikel's stead would undoubtedly make our midfield stronger. Anyone who disagrees I think is not quite seeing the whole picture. Is Mikel complete garbage? Absolutely not. But I think it's more than fair to say we can (and should) look to upgrade if he's expected to be first choice for years to come.

For me he has not added any attributes to his game since he first arrived at the club, let's not forget that he was highly sought after and cost £16 million - £12m of which we had to pay to United, at 23 now I don't think there's any chance we would get that sort of fee selling him so in that sense he has not lived up to the hype.

Comparing him to say Alex Song at Arsenal who is around the same age and plays a similar position displays where Mikel has come up short. Song cost only £1m and up until last season was similar in respects to Mikel - inconsistent etc, Song had a breakout season last season notching 14 assists and coming runner-up only to Van Persie for Arsenal's player of the year.

... you've not understood, again. I never said rioting is the answer, it is an unescapable undeniable **symptom** that proves a systemic failure. It's not something vague either, it was explicit in your face brutal reality.

There is a complex debate to be had here, riots were instrumental in the suffragette movement, they were instrumental in the Blitz when the government had locked the people out of the subway system even though that was the safest place to hide, while Gandhi was doing his thing there was much violence going on, the American revolution was one big riot, so there is a case to be made that all rights have had to be wrestled from power by force.

Now you, like the rioters, aren't engaging with me intellectually you are responding irrationally and becoming indignant and offended; you've called me 'heartless and appalling' which means nothing but to vilify me.

&gt; Common decency

This idea doesn't exist. People behave according to their environment. Take a baby and have him grow up in a vacuum of nothingness and you will not get a walking talking 'decent' human. I see this only a step up from the christian good/evil world view, it says nothing and doesn't get us any closer to a solution or understanding. If you watched the whole film then you would have heard testimony from random people (a middle age mum on the school board or something and a bloke in a pub) who joined in. If you had been there you might have too, I might have been one of those people who just through one rock or flicked the V's or shouted obscenities at the police.

&gt; I come from a poor family.

You cannot project your life across all and be so judgemental. The riots began with people fighting with the police without fear. The looting is a side issue once people lost the fear.

&gt; I didn't have designer clothes, a mobile phone of ANY description or at one point even a television of any shape, size or description.

And where did you get that definition of richness from? Like the rioters you are thinking in terms of material goods. What about role models? Good parenting? A past? A future? A political voice? A house that is owned and not rented? Access to an environment not high in crime? Access to open spaces? I grew up climbing trees. (It's early research but there is evidence correlating low IQ with heavily fluoridated tap water, which happen to be in poor areas, along with higher than normal fluoride levels in processed food and cheap meats, and which the poor would eat.)   

Of my immediate local friends, two became parents at 16 and were kicked out sleeping rough in a park, one became an alcoholic working minimum wage and they eventually split at 25. The boy's (at the time) family fell apart through excessive credit card debt, his parents split, his sisters each were pregnant by the time they were twenty. My next door neighbour served a prison sentence for driving his car through an ex's window, he kicked his own kid in the stomach for changing the TV channel to the teletubbies. A third friend's parent's marriage fell apart through domestic abuse and alcoholism and he left to live in wales. I myself am from a single parent family after my mother suffered domestic abuse and mental ill-health for a decade; partly due to chiristian upbringing, partly due to brain trauma from a road accident, partly due to high hours low waged shift-work. (She had gone to the church, to the doctors and so on but she was told to 'think of the kids'.) One particular incident was my father strangling my mother on the front lawn while my older sister smashed him with a stick. I've had my face shoved in food and been bashed around the head numerous times. No door was left without fist holes. I've had my dad hold a knife in my hand against his stomach, telling me to say when. I had no idea as a child that this wasn't normal.

At the age of eleven (as my dad moved out) just by chance I didn't go to the local state school. I hadn't by chance gone to the local primary school either. The girl I liked happened to pick a grammar school in another district. I happened to ace the entrance exams and was given a full scholarship. Oddly enough I started out as an oxbridge candidate but by the end there was one teacher who stopped talking to me out of disappointment. 'You should be preparing for Cambridge or something' was the last I can remember. So by virtue of getting schooling two busses away it meant I never got involved with any pseudo-gang issues, under age drinking, under age sex (classes were separated by gender) that kind of thing. It meant I had to love my own company I suppose. To this day I have never gotten into a fight, never even hit a person, I have never cheated anything, I have never stolen anything, not even a pen or a housemate's food. The only person I have given a nasty verbal assault to would be my father.

Why am I telling you this? Because I don't take all that, project it on others to then say everyone else should be able to turn out 'decent' like me. Hell I am angry at the injustices in the world, but unlike unconscious irrational outpourings of dissent (ie: rioting) I choose a more intelligent approach. However, I recognise the riots as an important and legitimate indicator of some other illness, and it deserves more than just being explained away by saying these were the actions of the indecent.",0,1344957608,null,0,false,0,c5szn27,t3_y5wca,t1_c5szn27,t1_c5syfwa,null,1429635755,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But you did say that you were glad that they happened. Yes, I seek to villify that. You have said that you are glad that people's livlihoods were destroyed - people did die during the riots, people were beaten and terrified during the riots and you said that you were glad that they happened. That to me, is cold and heartless. That is not a response I ever expected anyone to have. I genuinely believed, that people understood that riots, where people's businesses are hurt, where people are hurt, where men lose their lives trying to protect their community could be something where anyone would be glad that it happened.

&gt;If you had been there you might have too

No, I wouldn't have. Common Decency DOES exist. Yes, a baby who grows up in vacuum won't have common decency - it comes from community - with family, with local interaction. People don't grow up in vacuums. They go to school with others, they interact with other people, they learn right from wrong. These people knew that what they were doing was wrong and they didn't care.

Not all of the riots started with fighting with police. That was a single area - thenm other people copied. A child brought up in a vacuum wouldn't have learned to copy other peoples behaviour either, this is something children do as the quickest way to learn - it's a commonality

I am sorry that you had what sounds like an incredibly traumatic childhood (only words that I have). But you are still projecting your life experience. You are seeing the negative of growing up in a poor area and understanding how you escaped and were - quite frankly - lucky. You said it was by chance that you didn't go to the local state school. It might not have been much luck - but there you have it. Luck. You had to get 2 buses to get to school, which is why you missed out on the life that some of the people you mentioned have lived. But you insinuate that if that hadn't happend, that you'd have been there, like that.

Why? Why are you so sure, that if you hadn't had the by-chance going to a different school and then getting a full-scolarship to a grammar school that you still wouldn't choose the intelligent approach anyway? Why wouldn't you have just not been like that. 

As I said in another comment - not everyone in those areas *did* get involved. For every rioter (sp?) there were half a dozen people in those areas who didn't go out and cause trouble. They come from the same families, had the same upbringing, live in the same destitution with the same flouride infused water and processed food in the same broken society.

So why did some do it and others not? Because it was wrong. And it *really* is as simple as that.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"The football manager comment was pretty obviously a quip, but I do think there's something to be said about leaving it till the end every single time.

Sticking to guns can be a very good thing, but if your valuations are fucking retarded and unrealistic, it can also be a very bad thing. We've failed to trim the fat from our squad year after year simply because teams won't pay us over the odds for players like Jenas and Bentley who should probably go for basically nothing. 

We could clear so much off our wage bill and indeed fund transfers if Levy just cut his losses on some of these players and accepted reality with Modric.

Even if we'd sold Luka for ~30m 2 weeks ago we'd be in a very good position right now. Instead we're either going to have dressing room cancer for the season or we're going to have no replacement. 

At some point it becomes an exercise in blind pride. If we genuinely don't have any money to spend, fine. But if we were really willing to splash on Aguero last summer and Cavani before the world cup as was widely reported, it's getting hard to defend. 

My only hope is that there's something going on behind the scenes that is being kept very quiet even from ITK, because even they are doom and gloom now saying we're in shambles and Levy has fucked it up again. 

I can live with his previous windows because we weren't in this sort of situation with only one striker who isn't a hobbit and because we spent a lot in 09/10. 

I just don't think 3-4 really good bargains make up for this shit. He gets good deals occasionally, but you're telling me we couldn't have rid ourselves of the bulk by now and cleared some wage room? We've got people making probably 40k a week who won't play a minute for us this year. 

And I'm not just talking about Ade. There are myriad targets who would want to come here who we don't seem to even be aware of. That's not just on Levy, but our organization for doing transfer business seems to be absolute shit from the scouts to the coaches to the chairman. We paid 16m for David fucking Bentley, surely we can take a risk on someone like Dembele. 

The new manager probably has expected to be backed, and was probably told he would be. It's a perfect storm brewing. If we enter the season with this squad, we will finish 8th and AVB will be crucified the entire fucking time.

You are just being dishonest now. You are also being intellectually inconsistent when you say things like these people are just indecent yet you talk about how you need a decent environment, perhaps to learn self control or just to learn not to hate.

&gt; Why are you so sure?

I'm not so sure. I've suggested things would have been different because things would have been different! Different peer group, different teachers, etc. All I can do is look at the people around me, I'm very different. However, what you are denying me you are giving to yourself. You are allowing your personal story 'i was born and raised in poverty but turned out decent so every body should be able to do the same' yet not allowing mine. You actually drew hard conclusions I did not. It's a probability thing which you aren't really understanding.

If I drive whilst drunk it increases the chances of an accident, it doesn't mean all drunks will crash. The same goes for inequality, the higher the inequality the higher the chances of social unrest.

&gt; So why did some do it and others not? Because it was wrong. And it really is as simple as that.

It's complex, this is undeniable.

In a way you over simplification makes no sense and complete sense at the same time. You've accidentally defined the problem. Some people really did this because it was wrong, 'we are going to fight police because fuck your authority', 'we are going to steal your shit because fuck your economic policy'.

We aren't getting anywhere really. It is a mistake to take your personal moral framework, behaviour, and self-control and push it on others.

true,samw11,english,Sunny Runny,"Right - I clearly offended you, for which I apologise. I am going to explain why your statement sounded so downright off-the charts wrong to me, and hopefully, you will accept that;

You stated that you were glad that the riots had happened. During these riots, 3 men lost their lives trying to defend their community.

People's homes were invaded - it doesn't matter if these people were rich or poor or other, their homes were invaded by a baying mob.

People were beaten and mugged in the streets.

Historic buildings were destroyed (I've got to be honest, whilst I put human life above a building every time, destroying our heritage angers the shit out of me).

People's businesses, not just the big heavily insured corporate chains, but little shops were destroyed and damaged, fire engines were destroyed and in Liverpool they even set fire to wheelie bins!

All of this damage had to be paid for by the public purse. Now that sounds like it's some kind of mythical fund, but it isn't, it's the insane taxes that I pay and you pay &amp; my Nanna, who is an old age pensioner, pays. That is our money, taken from schools and hospitals and prisons and the armed forces and whatever else the government of the day see's fit to spend my hard earned taxes on.

ALL of those things happened in the riots that you had just said that you were glad happened.

Can you see where my conclusion came from?

As I said at the start, I didn't mean to offend. I was as the Wow implied, astounded that something that had caused so much pain and suffering, cost so much to put right and been such a destructive thing, could have come from something you had just typed that you were glad had happened.

Cheaper. It's still cheaper almost all the time.

You're bringing things up that haven't happened and aren't relevant to this discussion. As it stands, having free wifi on buses is better than not having free wifi on buses.

&gt;... decriminalising narcotics serves to remove from the penal system people who are ill. Treat drug addicts as you would alcoholics and we have the chance to rehabilitate them properly which is more effective than prison (where drugs are available anyway and people get a vocational training in criminality) and cheaper than alternative punishments too.

&gt;I still don't like the availability of drugs (marijuana aside) being made more pervasive though because drug addicts need treating not an easier avenue to score and whether their substance is legal or not is a moot point: they will still commit crime to get the money to fund their habits.

true,samw11,english,Sunny Runny,"You can't start a riot with less than 12 people - random not-so fun fact for you there.

The gutter is the phrase that would have been used in the early 1800's when the books is set - it isn't supposed to be a modern analogy.

The point of the quote is that people don't choose to be born into poverty or starvation or third world deprivation. Being born into that is not a crime, it's not a sin and it most certainly isn't a choice.

The context of the quote is that one man, Sharpe, is trying to better himself and needs help to do so. I'm fairly certain it's Harper who makes the quote, when the other's don't want to help initially.
A man has taken the hand life has dealt him &amp; is trying to make it a better lot, he can't do it on his own. They other's are initially asking why they should help him better himself, Harper makes the point that bettering yourself and your lot in life is not the crime... just putting up with it &amp; (in the books &amp; the exact situation they were in) drinking, whoring and gambling instead of doing something about it, when you actually have a choice, *is* a crime. Please note that it is a crime **when** you have a choice. If there is no choice, well... that pretty much speaks for itself.

Also you note that you have never signed on during the time you have been out of work. Why? (at this point there is no criticism or implied criticism). That is what it is there for. To help people who are out of work, get work. If you have not earned more than £4-5k in any given year of your life that is less than half of the national minimum wage for a full time job. even if you are not entitled to full JSA - you would be entitled to assistance and it is there for you. It is paid for by your taxes (which includesd VAT &amp; fuel duty, yes, even on your electricity bills) and it is there to make sure that people who cannot work can get by.

&amp; what exactly is wrong with working in Footlocker or McDonalds? Ok, I haven't worked in Footlocker, but I've worked in McDonalds (I don't think they've got a reputation for turning people away for being over qualified), I've worked 2 or 3 jobs at a time to make ends meet and I've done menial part time and temporary work. Sorry, forgot you don't like me to personalise things. My point is, it might not be what they look up to, it might be a stepping stone to that thing. Maybe it's to earn the money to go to college, or a deposit for a house (rented or owned or whatever), maybe it's just to pay for a fantastic Christmas Present for your Mum, or maybe it's your first step in a career doing anything at all... the point is - maybe that's all they can see to start with, but there's no reason for it to be the top of the pile that they are aiming at. A little ambition is not a bad thing and breaking it down into manageable chunks is probably the best way to do it. Like the time management man used to say - you can't eat an elephant in one sitting. But you can eat an elephant steak &amp; if you eat enough for loing enough, eventually, the elephant will be all gone (I do hope that there's a bloody big freezer or where it has gone will be off... sorry - it's Tuesday, &amp; I don't like doing serious on Tuesday's).

Back to my overly long post... I know that it isn't easy to get a job when you don't have one, and I won't lie to you and say that you definitely will get one at some point - because it's bullshit in this economy and everyone knows it.

I can give you advice though, which has worked, not just for me, but for other people too, including my siblings and some friends... if you can't get a paying job, sign on &amp; get a voluntary job in a charity shop or something. Having worked in recruitment previously, I can tell you that a CV with unpaid work on it will gravitate towards the top of a pile, dependant upon other skills and experience and after the spelling errors and grammatical faux pas have been binned.

Because it was against Stoke, I would assume that the game against Stoke this year would also go on general sale. I was able to get pretty darn good seats for my girlfriend and I. If you are bringing more people though, I would probably go ahead and buy a bronze membership if you want to sit together. 

[Here is a little guide to WHL](http://www.footballgroundguide.com/tottenham_hotspur)

Buses on match day are packed. The Seven Sisters underground stop is the closest stop but it is still a fair walk to WHL. Cabs are EXPENSIVE. Also I would recommend taking a WHL tour, I got a lot of cool information and you get a really nice look at the stadium.

There is a Spurs forum that has a lot of information about what to do on game days. I'll give you some of the helpful threads that I have seen on there.

Many of the promotion cycles are, essentially, 'dead mens shoes' (although mostly retired rather than dead these days, thankfully).

But in the military, to officially do job X, you need to also be trained to do the job above too.  That's one way in which they build resilliance into the system.

So when a person leaves, one of the people below fills the spot.  However, this then cascades down, and you now have a chain of people who are all needing to go on a training course to fully meet the expectations of someone at their level.

And _that's_ the sort of thing that they mean here.  If you cancel a bunch of training courses, then it's going to take time to recover that depth of redundant skills.

Because, although it only takes one man to fire a weapon, you do _not_ want to deploy with only one man _able_ to do so.

In other EU countries, their major hub isn't quite as crowded, so I guess driving is an option that can compete with public transport.

Yes, losing Fletcher will be a pain, but we'll have two promising young strikers, plus Ebanks, Doyle, and possibly players from the acedemy to fill his place. If we desperately need a new striker, I'm sure Solbakken, with his European experience, would know some gems to pick up.

Plus, while having a striker is good, I think having a solid defence is better. As shown by last seasons countless 2-1 and 3-2 defeats, with us taking the lead then going behind, we need a better defence. I would rather invest that £15m in one solid defender than keeping one solid attack, and for £15m you would probably be able to get 2, or maybe 3, solid defenders in. 

And yeah, it does annoy me how people complain about the cost. Somehow it's OK for Porto to say Hulk can't go for £60m, while Fletcher should go for like £6m or something. The club doesn't need the money. While I would rather him go and we buy in some good defenders, I don't want him to go for a low, or even reasonable price, if Sunderland is willing to pay a silly price, then sell him for a silly price.

 I agree with you about this subreddit having a hivemind about certain players. But when it comes to Mikel the argument is a valid one.

I've downvoted you plenty of times but not after we've struck up a discussion. So trying to play a pity card like that is silly.

'Empirical back up.' You put up a passing stat. Here's one for you. 4/5 of Mikels attempted passes are back. That is the reason his passing rate is so high. 

Also, word of advice. If you're going to get player quotes on another player, get them from players from other teams.

Now in a troubled economy you're saying they're trying to relaunch and, unless I'm missing something, you want to run for the pitchforks and torches over a grudge you have as a former employee.  I'm sure they didn't go insolvent on purpose. 

So what is it that I'm missing, or is this just sour grapes for a restart that may actually provide other people jobs?  I can understand people being upset that a company went tits up for a bit, but I don't see anything to suggest that their actions were criminal. 

Why be vindictive about a restart?  Either they didn't declare bankruptcy or they've got a new MD (as it turns out it's both).  Lost wages can be claimed when the company went into administration.  The key word there is ADMINISTRATION.  The company went into administration, so if people didn't receive pay or holiday the company owners would have been frozen out and it was down to the appointed administrators.  

[EDIT]  After a little more digging it was a family business that has been brought out of administration by another member of the family, another local business person, and they'll have had to put a shit load of money/collateral down to pay off the debt.  So if you want to fuck up even more people's jobs, and even more local business, just carry on with what you're doing!  

They owed HMRC £800k and £600k to unsecured creditors.  As a taxpayer I can congratulate them for avoiding bankruptcy and entering administration so they could find a solution!!!

Ben More (Mull). There is a Golden Eagle nest near the top, last time I was up we had 3 circling close overhead for the last 10 minutes of the climb, was fantastic.

Schiehallion. In my opinion the best looking hill in Scotland due to its symmetry.

Ben Lomond has some of the most beautiful views in my opinion.

I can sort of understand why they do it - no host city has enough Olympic stadium capacity for men's and women's football as well as rugby...

I like the idea, though. Maybe they should introduce the same for football: seven-a-side for 20-30 minutes each would make for a quick and enjoyable tournament!

Taekwondo is a different issue - they wanted to include a proper martial arts that was not limited to hands, and my understanding is that TKD won out because (1) Seoul was the host when they introduced it (2) they had to include more non-western sports to cater to the Asian members (3) TKD has only two world federations, and is thus much less splintered than kick-boxing, karate, gong fu or jiu jitsu.

true,NEWSBOT3,cnty-uk,Londontown,"First of all you'd like me to believe that because a company produces one type of software, everything else it does must work on the same principles. As well as having a degree in Software Engineering,  I've worked in a number of companies producing software over the last ten years, and this is pretty rare. Generally above a certain scale, different products are managed by different teams, and while they might re-use code and libraries, they do the minimum work possible to make the maximum profit. So your first assumption is pretty unlikely, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt on your first assumption, it could go either way. 

On top of that, then you are assuming that my employers are both malicious and have some sort of sinister buddy relationship with every other major company head where they cackle evilly and plot how to fuck us all over every day. Again, i know a number of company CEO's and MD's personally, and while some of them i would rightly describe as 'cunts only out for themselves', the majority are not bastards. They wouldn't put much effort into redundancies other than 'who is cheapest to get rid of' and 'who do i dislike/brings least benefit'. Most of them work 16 hour days and go home to their families, they have little time for anything else.

As much as media would like you to believe, most company management is not out to get the little people. Given that senior management actually spends most of their  time working, they don't really have time to socialize with anyone, and if they do, how do they meet other company senior management ? is there some secret club for them to organize to meet other overworked stressed out people ? I'm doubtful. So I'm pretty certain that its fairly unlikely for your your 2nd and 3rd assumptions are just paranoia.

Your next assumption is that Trapwire having such information would hand it out freely, when in your scenario it's clearly of worth. Companies don't do that. If they can make money from an asset/product they will do. They might give discounts to friends, but they aren't going to hand it out for free. So your fourth assumption is just downright silly. You both want me to believe companies are malicious entities and yet they'll disregard large profits hand things out free to their friends ? i don't think so.

Now your next assumption is that some vague authority somehow gains access to data and compiles this all together. Have you had any experience working in a company, really ? Most government organizations struggle to even get their staff to turn up on time and  do any actual work, never mind getting them to stay with the low wages and crappy prospects, and then somehow they are going to design this massive scale system that brings all this different data together and organizes it perfectly ? Do you have any idea the scale and the volume of data you are talking about ? the hardware and software resources necessary to do such a thing and make it searchable in any reasonable time frame ? Some of the best IT engineers in the world would struggle to design, build and maintain a system with such an insanely massive scope, and you'd like me to assume that a governmental agency can do it ? that's actually making me laugh out loud.  Your fifth assumption is just bonkers. Yes, with the advance of technology it will become easier to do, but you'd still need very highly skilled people to design and run it, and that does not happen in government organisations. Such people leave for jobs with prospects and decent pay, neither of which a government has ever been able to offer skilled workers.

so really, i have to believe that 5 assumptions of yours are true, when most of them are clearly bonkers.

This might work since Stoke isn't a big club. I walked up to the ticket office the morning of the 2009 match against Wigan and bought a ticket (was alone). Multiple people in front of me on line bought seats of 2,3,4 and the guy was surprised I only wanted one.

I was originally sitting with some kids (and their father across from them in a row) but we switched (and he gave me his ticket, which I'm sure he regrets now!).

**Definitely contact the club!** They seem to be very supportive of visiting fans. I didn't think of doing that either of the times I've gone.
I think the person to contact is Darren Eales (or is he the guy that left for Vancouver FC?). I believe his email is public, but I don't know it myself.

**Transportation:**
I know I've taken the tube to Seven Sisters and then took a bus down the road to the stadium (for one match--Reading--and to see the stadium).

When I went to the Wigan match, I got on the National Rail at Liverpool Station (I think) and took it to Northumberland Park and walked to the ground.

He slows the ball down too much for us to form a decent attack. That's the issue here. As I've said he is good in defense but for a world class team he is too limited in his all-round game. This style suited Chelsea when we had Drogba upfront because we could just hoof it up field. As opposed to building from deep. De Jong has more of an engine in him than Mikel also and is better on the ball. If Mikel comes out this season and shows vast improvement in this area, I will be delighted. But in the six years that he's been at the club he has been too inconsistent and too slow on the ball.

2. I'm not assuming all employers are evil, it's more an application of Sod's law. We know Stratfor had a division called StratCap who would make financial investments presumably based on intel. In today's world companies of a sufficient size cease to be what ever they were and become closer to hedge funds. The sort of power that comes from knowing what car drove where, which card was used, and recognising faces is unbelievable, so unbelievable that people pen lengthy posts to laugh at the paranoid.

3. I'll remind you of the secret blacklist used to punish unionised workers from last week. I'll point you in the direction of the BBC who used (and probably still do use) the secret services to screen out political dissidents.  It happens in government to this day, but oddly enough the same checks weren't made for Coulsen (of hacking scandal fame) when he became a Cameron appointee.

4. I never made the assumption of them handing out information to just anyone. You are taking 'your employer' too literally. You employer might be the government, it might be the City of London Corporation. Sod's law.

Not even sure why this is.

On a larger scale the entire world is becoming more religious with the exception of Europe (excluding the Muslims there). China is becoming more Christian. The US has gone through an increasingly fanatical stage. South America has seen an up swing in Protestant belief. In Israel and across the Middle East people have taken their religion more seriously.

Interestingly it is not a phenomena associated with the poor or uneducated either.

Not sure why Europe has been the exception.

true,dotwaffle,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"I doubt it's necessarily ""corporate"" interests, but self interests for sure. Those with strong links to big corporations are likely to be influenced by them, and likewise, those with strong links to Unions are likely to try and get a better deal for those Unions - and that's why the basic salary for a Passenger Service Agent on the DLR has a *starting* salary of £35k, a driver typically earning £50k or more. I absolutely agree that those interests *should* be represented, it's just that present-day politics does seem to lend itself to strong-arming.

If I was to identify five politicians that I genuinely believed were trying to do ""the right thing"", I'd pick Boris Johnson, David Davis, Gordon Brown (yes, what of it?), Tony Benn and Julian Huppert. That doesn't necessarily mean I'd vote for them, I just think they're honest people that work hard to ""make Britain better"" unlike Louise Mensch who did seem to use parliament to further her media career, Claire Perry who seems to be a right-wing meddler and Hazel Blears who just won't answer the f**king question.

I just noticed that all the people I disliked were women... I certainly don't mean anything by that - it just happens to be that way. Perhaps I should add Nick Clegg to the list (no, he's too easy a target) - I will add Harriet Harman, Caroline Lucas and Leanne Wood to the list of ""people I can't stand"".

He is doing exactly what he was told. the coaches expect more from him defensively than offensively. Mike will be playing along another midfielder in the DM role this season his task will be soley to focus on defense and let whosoever playing along side him deals with the offense. He's also capable of passing long balls as you saw in the video, he was once a attacking midfeilder until we took him and force him to be a defensive midfielder.  The reason you guys talk a load of  ish about DM's is because as the game progress people starts to not appreciate their role, and that is very bad, as you saw from last year champions league win the role of DM is the corner stone of the midfield. They are beginig to go extinct because of the more attacking minded football people are starting to play. ask Barcelona how important it is to have a player as versatile at that role like mikel and they will tell you.
