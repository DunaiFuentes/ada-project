Drogba must start. Give 60-65 minutes of a beating to the CBs (One who hasn't played in what, almost a month?), maybe steal a goal or two here or there but he must start to at worst, wear down the center backs.

Sturridge brings power to our RW which will be nice, because whoever is playing leftback (Lahm/Boateng/Diego Contento) he should be able to power through. Aside from Lahm, the other two are not particularily good left backs.

Having Mata on that LW compliments that speed that Bayern Munich is going to have on their right side ( Robben/Lahm or Rafinha or Boateng), so having Mata and Cole on our left will help against that.

Lampard can hold the CAM slot, he'll have to compete against Schweinsteiger and Tymoshchuk/Toni Kroos, but he should be ok.


We will desperately need to give Bosingwa cover against Ribery, so having Essien on the RDM slot I think would work best.

Mikel can marshal the defensive midfield against Kroos/Müller (whomever starts) and any cutting Robben/Ribery. 

Cole can handle Robben on his own me thinks.

We don't have any other choice for our CB pairing so, go them! They should be able to contain Gomez as he is not the most technical forward on the planet, he just gets a billion chances a game.

Added to that the government has allowed the playing field to be slanted in favour, allowing them a better chance to win contracts, AND has told every public body they should have at least one contract with them.  The average job is subsidised by £25k per year.  The government funding package was £555 million over 5 years.

You have to ask what Remploy is, is it a welfare service to help disabled people, or is it a scheme which allowed disabled people to  equal work and allowed them to compete in the work place.  If it's a service then fair enough, run at a loss.  If it was to set up a business model which also worked to employ disabled people it's failed.  It's not competing in the main despite being given several advantages.  They're not ordering them shut, rather they're not carrying on with the subsidy for 36 of the 54 factories which are not viable or potentially viable.  If they were viable they wouldn't need these subsidies after being established, no jobs would be lost.

I know I sound like a bastard but if you set a factory up, pay for whatever installations, put in official government guidance that every public body should reserve at least one contract for them, where every job is subsidised on average by £25,000, and then they still don't turn a viable profit then it's not creating meaningful work.

The 18 factories that are manufacturing and are viable in their own right are still going to get their subsidy, and by all accounts they must be doing very well indeed.  It appears the other 36 had no idea how to run a factory whatsoever and have run them into the ground with little or nothing coming off the production line.

It's not in their nature to make any alliance with anyone, even to save the universe and their own existence. They just don't do that. Everything that isn't Dalek is an abomination as far as they are concerned.

It mostly seemed like Moffat wanting to increase the tension of the finale. ""I know, lets have all of his enemies working together!""  Which you know, could be cool if it was a season long plot. But to just have them all together at the end was unbelievable and felt more like cheap thrills than any kind of real story.

And as for their plan? They believe he is responsible for the cracks so they seal him in a box that will keep him alive for the rest of time, which can also be opened by a Sonic Screwdriver. Why they didn't just kill him is beyond me. You would think the Daleks would learn to just shoot on sight by now.

Looking deeper, it makes no sense why the Alliance would need to use Amy in any way for this. Why they had to use her memories to make the perfect trap is never really explained. I suppose it was mostly to write Rory back into it.

As for the Time Loop, it doesn't make sense. As fun as the line, ""Wibbley Wobbley Timey Wimey"" is, I think it's become the fans excuse to avoid any kind of criticism of the show. Glaring plot holes? ""Wibbley Wobbley Timey Wimey!""

I know it's just a show, but I'd like it to make some sense. I can't just turn off all disbelief. When I've been told Daleks kill everything that isn't Dalek, and then see them working in an Alliance, it pulls me out of the story because I am just thinking the whole time, ""This is ridiculous"". And that is the feeling I left with after Season 5.

If Argentina weren't the opposition, this game would have barely made the news even though the women won Gold and the Men won Bronze.

EDIT: Should point out i understand about the video the Argentinians made on the Falklands. I just think the media are clutching at straws practically implying some kind of political motivation behind these injuries to GB players. This really isn't any more newsworthy than any other hockey related story.

I personally feel that, with a couple of additions, the team are close to getting it right.

There are three obvious areas for improvement. The injury to Lucas really hurt the team. That's when the run of bad form started and it became apparent just how important he is to the team. He wins possession, covers the defence and generally acts as the hub of the team. We need cover in that position as Spearing just isn't as good in that role. Another (pacey) winger to add width and service the attack. We desperately lack pace in the squad and the quality of crosses just hasn't been god enough.

That said, the face is horrifying.

The issue is the nose, mouth, and chin. These are difficult sections of the face to get right, and if you get them wrong (particularly in portraits such as these) the results are frightening.

The nose has this odd line of shading that indicates a bulb on the nose, which is wholly unappealing. The naso-labial creases are far too pronounced and the dimple between her nose and upper lip is far too pronounced.

There's no shading on the teeth at all and the sheen on the lips creates the image of total flatness. The pronounced line under the bottom lip and before the chin is also an unpleasant distraction.

Most large counties in England have their own dialects, as do most regions of Italy and many areas of France, Germany and Spain. Does that make Veneto or South Shields into nations? Is Normandy a nation? How about Franconia or Bavaria? 

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do have their own National Assemblies, but they aren’t governments. They can’t raise taxes, and they cant legislate anything contrary to UK law.

I have really no idea how [you](http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3p61lf/) think all of this advances your notion that “people in Northern Ireland aren’t really British,” but, hey-ho. Enjoy.

We're forgetting what he did for us last season after Roy and all that nonsense. Now this year he brought us a trophy, the first since 2006, and literally an inch away from another. I don't ever really remember him belittling a reporter more than what they deserved to be honest. I think he handles himself well compared to other managers.

I know the teams form in the premiership isn't what we'd like and I know his signings haven't performed as we'd like but look at it from his view or at least what you think his view would be. Downing is an England international who specialized in assists and crosses. We happen to have a big guy in the box who needs good service. Was the price tag a little much? Yes, but we needed that service and Downing had been doing it so well at Villa. Henderson is the captain for the England U21 team and is considered a top prospect. Carroll just showed us in the FA Cup final what he is capable of and I love it. Adam, wasn't doing horrible for us in the beginning of the year but I'm not so sure why we needed him. The performance of these players doesn't fall on the manager for me. I'm not sure how he can regulate how well they play, how clinical the finishing is or how many times the ball goes into the net instead of hitting the crossbar.

Also, I'd hate to be that guy but.. Lucas. We were playing extremely well the week or two leading up to the Lucas injury. He was winning balls left and right, making smart passes, everything we could have asked of him he did. Then that was all somewhat taken away. You can't replace Lucas Leiva, especially not with Jay Spearing.

Lastly, King Kenny lives and breathes Liverpool Football Club. There is no one on the planet that wants to see Liverpool succeed more than him. You won't find another more determined manager anywhere. The players love him and the fans do too. I don't think it's right for managers to have a one year leash. He was our savior a year ago but now people are throwing him to the dogs. He was once a very successful manager, people have said that that was a different time and the game has evolved since but how can Kenny evolve if he gets the boot after one year? Give him one more year to show us what he can do.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"The Guardiola situation is a little unfair to Pep, considering how Barcelona actually played very well this season and were only eclipsed by how Real Madrid played even better. His resignation was perhaps expected, because he's smart enough to know that the standards by which Barcelon are held to are ridiculous, where not winning the season is considered a failure. The amount of stress is unbelievable, and it's always better to leave before you let it get to you. 

I absolutely disagree with the reinstatement of Rafa. If Dalglish now presents a dilemma due to his status as a club legend, Rafa will bring the same exact problem. Even though he is not as high up the Liverpool pantheon as King Kenny, there are **a lot** of Liverpool fans who are younger or more recent converts, and these fans will remember Istanbul much more vividly than what Kenny achieved more than 20 years ago. Any failure on the part of Rafa will result in another dilemma. Rafa doesn't have a good history of dealing with stress, his petulant press conferences full of ""facts"" when in Liverpool or his ridiculous ""not my responsibility"" interviews at Inter Milan show this, His one foray into management after Liverpool saw him sacked after 6 months, which doesn't bode well. Most importantly, he is known for his poor man-management, and that is a quality that we sorely need.

Maybe if there were more local chapters, where I could get together with a bunch of people, I'd be more inclined to join, but it seems like all the ones on the West Coast are down in California, sadly. I'm already a True Blue member, which gives me guaranteed access to all the matches as well. As far as the amount of members, I don't think that really plays a factor here. There may only be 1000 members of the club, but I think they care more about how packed the stands are. There were 65,000+ people in their last match at Seattle, and will be again this year. That was obviously enough in 2009 to keep them coming back to the States, even though the club may only have 1,000. Their relationships with the MLS clubs are already set and strong.

I'm not trying to be a downer, but I just don't see the point of this for my situation. I don't want this to just be critism though, so I'll provide a constructive example as to what would get me to join. Design an exclusive T-Shirt with CFC that is made only available via membership with CIA. Doesn't have to be anything grand and it doesn't even have to be CIA branded (I'd almost prefer it isn't, or at least non-intrusive). Drop the $10 off at the megastore to make up the difference. That way I get something unique that can only be had by being a member of CIA. You could maybe even get a few designs and vote on them, that way majority of the club gets one that they want...or you could just offer all designs and have them select one when signing up.

true,badge,eng-westmidlands,London from Brum,"&gt; The current A-level system does not, by itself, provide adequate differentiation between the very best students and the merely very good.

This is becoming an increasing problem for mathematics departments at Russell Group universities. With 45% of A-Level Mathematics students being awarded As (and A stars), and 60% of Further Mathematics students similarly, the ability to differentiate between students is rapidly decreasing. At my department we’ve seen required grades hit AAA* or *AAB* if the *B* is Further Maths, and that’s for the BSc programme (MSci is *AAA**) students who don’t examine well don’t have a chance to perform well at interviews.

Having been involved in diagnostic testing of first-year undergraduates, I’ve seen that the increasing grades do not translate to improved performance on our first-week diagnostic test. This has been replicated at other maths departments over several decades. Overall, examinations are insufficient for determining students’ abilities in mathematics, and I daresay in a lot of other subjects as well. I refer to one of my favourite quotes on the matter, funnily enough from Cardinal Newman, who had the following to say about what examinations produce:

&gt; Ill-used persons, who are forced to load their minds with a score of subjects against an examination, who have too much on their hands to indulge themselves in thinking or investigation, who devour premiss and conclusion together with indiscriminate greediness, who hold whole sciences on faith, and commit demonstrations to memory, and who too often, as might be expected, when their period of education is passed, throw up all they have learned in disgust, having gained nothing really by their anxious labours, except perhaps the habit of application.",0,1336412293,null,0,true,0,c4l60rd,t3_tb0qy,t1_c4l60rd,t3_tb0qy,null,1428875345,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

There has been numerous times in recent weeks when i have actually laughed out loud at how bad we have been, the Blackburn game recently was probably on par with some of the greatest farce comedy ever written.

He has won us the mickey mouse cup, okay its nice to win something once in a while, but its a cup that most teams play there reserves as winning it has very little prestige, look at the past winners/finalists, its a joke to most managers.

Lucas got injured before the transfer market closed, if Lucas is such a lynchpin why not replace him, everyone in the world could see that Spearing wasnt good enough to step up, being a bench player at best, and Charlie Adam doesnt have the skill set to play in that area, yes it ok to cover for a few games, but half a season, that is a massive mistake on Dalglish part, it could have just been a loan deal why we wait for Lucas to get back, or a free transfer, Mama Diarra went to Fulham after being a free transfer for ages, he would have definitely been better to have than not, and pretty cost effective.

See you cant defend that they are good players and where worth the money, if something else is wrong, either Dalglish is wrong for buying them, or he is playing them incorrectly so there underperforming, so then again its his fault. But he is a coach, if your players are doing poorly at finishing there chances, you train on finishing your chances none stop til its drummed into every muscle in the players body, how do you think RVP went from being a decent striker who was 'unlucky' to possibly the best striker in the world, practice, I admit there is always going to be those who it comes naturally too, but we dont have any of them players in our team and unnatural finishers will never live up to there standards, but i do very much believe that it is a skill that can be learned, even if its only partially.

You say Downing is good at crossing, but he always seems to come off the pitch as Carroll comes on to it, or vice versa.

He is too stuck in his way to change, he is stubborn and bullish, its part of his personality, its written all over his tactics, his reluctance to make changes even when its obviously not working, he is an old man, and he too far stuck in his groove to change, next year going to be pretty similar, as blaming luck doesnt wash with me, Great men make there own luck.

I think he should of cut his ties at the start of the season, as i foresaw this exact thing happening, his legacy going to shit as he was out of touch, and too stubborn to change and when it eventually failed, no one would have the heart to tell themselves he is shit. I dont have any genuine love for the man, i wasn't alive to see his success, i have saw videos, but history is history, I want to see us in the Champions League, witness the buzz of going to Anfield and it not being dead as there nothing to cheer about, I think we need to move forward, and acknowledge the past, but not dwell on it, there loads of teams with history with fuck all now, and if we continue to fall down the pecking order, whose to say we wont be the next Forest, or Leeds, or Preston?

But, I don't see it in much different light than many other moves.  Yes, sometimes players are just sold for financial reasons, but many times there are other reasons for the move.  In just recent history we have heard Alonso is said to have had problems with Rafa and Mascherano got a chance to be a part of one of the most successful clubs *ever*.  Who knows, this summer Kuyt and Maxi might leave to secure more regular roles with other clubs.

As much as I always want the best for Liverpool, I realize that footballers have *very* limited careers that can always be abruptly ended by injury.  I don't blame players for moving for an immediate chance at winning.  I also don't blame players who don't want to spend their time rebuilding a club.  We are still finding out just how bad things were at Liverpool F.C., it sounds like it was inches away from catastrophe.

Finally, I want what is best for LFC, but I also want to support players who bleed red--it's just more fun.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"&gt;Why are so many people so defensive of Dalglish?

Why are Christians so defensive of God? Younger Liverpool fans, or those who are recent converts may not feel the same way, but for long time Liverpool fans who have been around since the '80s, Kenny Dalglish is our God. To be exact, he is more like Jesus, since he belongs to the Holy Trinity of Shankly, Paisley and Dalglish. The fact that he attended every single funeral of the 96 victims of Hillsborough has done nothing but further his ""divinity"" in the minds of the Liverpool people. Make no mistake, in the eyes of the vast majority of Liverpool fans who attend every match, Kenny can do no wrong. 

If you want to go into a more detailed analysis of Daqlish's return to management, you have to see that by all accounts, Dalglish did nothing different this season as compared to what he did in the first 6 months of his current reign. He encourages an attacking style of play, seems to leave most tactical decisions to Steve Clarke, and has a good relationship with the players. So it's a little ridiculous that the same people who were calling for him to be given a permanent appointment 12 months ago are calling for his head for doing the exact same thing. 

The big reason why everyone is clamouring for Dalglish's head is due to our results, but our performance is actually still more or less the same. You can sometimes perform and not get results, and that's mostly what has happened to us this season. The fact that we've hit the post 40 times over one season says that we haven't exactly been lacking in attacking play. The fact that we've hit the post so many times also creates a huge mental barrier in players. Confidence takes a big hit when you hit the post again, and again, and again. If it only happens to one player, you can say that player has a problem with accuracy. If it happens to an entire team, you have to admit that bad luck plays a huge part, because there is no manager or coach in the world who is able to make his players hit the post with such frequency. Considering the surface area of the woodwork compared to the goal, and its actually harder to hit the post than to score, so either we're unlucky, or Dalglish found a way to convince our players that we get points for hitting the woodwork. Which would you rather believe?

The biggest reason why Dalglish should stay for 1 more season is because the team is still in transition. It wasn't in transition at the end of last season, because new players hadn't been brought in yet. It is now, because our old core players have aged another year, and our new guys have had a year to play with each other. When a new manager comes in, unless your entire first team is in its prime age-wise, the new manager will have to keep a certain core of the team while replacing the ageing players. The old core of Liverpool is admittedly Reina, Carragher and Gerrard, but no new core has emerged yet. Lucas is an uncertainty because we don't know how he will return after injury. Henderson is still developing, Carroll has only just started to show some glimpses of brilliance, and Suarez is the only one who seems like a good idea. This means that any new manager will either have to work with an **uncertain** core of players, or bring in replacements and risk another year of settling in. Giving Dalglish another year will gives us more answers than questions. By the summer of 2013, we will know for sure if Henderson and Carroll were worth it. Same for Suarez and Lucas. 

Another thing that needs to be disputed is the importance of the Carling Cup compared to the League table. I think the likelihood of us being in the top four disappeared around January or February. Which was around the same time where we won the Carling Cup. So you look at things in this way. You know the squad isn't strong enough. Do you: A) Put all your remaining efforts in the league, even though the best you can do is get an Europa League place which you already have, or B) Put more effort into the FA Cup, where you can win your 2nd trophy for the season and get some prestige which 5th or 6th place will not give you? Dalglish obviously went for B, and as it turned out, was only inches away from realising his goal. 

Kenny's first full season back has been full of hits and misses, with most people saying there were more misses than hits. I would agree, because 8th place is really not an acceptable position. However, league position aside, we will be in the same position as 2 out of Arsenal, Chelsea, Spurs and Newcastle. That's right, for all our woeful performances this season, we will be in the same competitions as two of the four teams fighting for 4th place. In real, practical terms, we just effectively finished in 5th place. Obviously a good showing in the Carling Cup in no way promises good results in the league, but it does well to show that our next season is one of **promise**, not despair. We are once again in Europe, we won one trophy and got to the final of another. This is not good performance for Liverpool, but it **IS** good for a club that was knocking on the doors of administration 18 months ago. 

If Dalglish goes, the only conceivable way would be for him to retire/resign. No matter if it is willing or not behind closed doors, it will be seen as Dalglish's decision in public. Liverpool cannot afford the backlash that will come from having its most highly-regarded member still alive to have to suffer the indignation of a firing. The fans will be livid, the media will have a field day, and Ferguson will find the chance to talk about how its a shame we fired our own legend. People will talk about how the American owners have no regard for history and respect for the man who has given so much to club and city. The firestorm will be equivalent to if every single member of our team called Evra a negro. Any replacement manager will face such scrutiny that headlines will be written over a stray white hair, and his face will come under umpteenth video replays looking for the slightest twitch of nervousness. There will be much gnashing of teeth, and rendering of robes. 

If Dalglish does resign (and there are signs that he might. He will not raise a fuss, he loves the club too much for that), any new manager needs to be completely fresh to the Premier League, because that will be the only way criticism can be averted. There aren't many teams in England with the prestige of Liverpool, so anyone coming here from Britain will be accused of having a small club mentality the moment he steps through the doors. A modern, successful manager who is highly regarded will be key. How many of these can you name? I can think of Guardiola and Deschamps. Can we actually get them to come? Laudrup might be good for his attack style, but his managerial career has been so-so. Before calling for Kenny's head, we have to consider the options for replacement. Can you think of someone who can replace Kenny, not just in terms of managerial performance, but also in terms of his place in Liverpool's heart?

Much like the character herself, she was longing for the Doctor, but left for want. The song has this sort of lonely beauty to it without sounding like it's mourning or bemoaning. It has strength without being showy and fits the character well.

[Donna's Theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzQD5OO-8ho&amp;feature=related) is probably the most fitting of her character. It's got a sort of Sex and the City sort of attempt at glamour from the strings and piano, but has this ever-present bounce to it and fantastic use of brass. It's got so much life to it, but has moments of quiet tenderness. Frankly the song alone embodies everything about the character and is one of my favorite these if not only for how willing it is to be different from all the other themes.

But Amy's Theme... it just overloads itself with an attempt at depth, from the solo cooing at the beginning, to the choral wailing to the melodramatic tumble of the piano. It's a beautiful piece, but it's quiet and subdued and deep and pensive, which Amy is decidedly *not*. It's really quite dissonant.",0,1336416130,null,0,false,0,c4l6vpg,t3_tbg2j,t1_c4l6vpg,t3_tbg2j,null,1428875741,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Also with your A) and B) scenario, would managers like Shankley or Paisley put up with that, no they wouldnt neither would be able to sleep knowing that fans are paying £50-60 for a ticket to see there team play shit, so if Dalglish is part of the this immortal trinity, why should he have a different view. Would Shankley or Paisley hide behind the luck excuse? would they fuck, you can say your unlucky once, if your unlucky numerous times, maybe your just bad.

I guess without a chapter in my area, I see no reason to join because I'll basically be paying $10 to go to a forum and find people in my area to meet up with. I could do that on here and other various networks for free and find plenty of people, I'm sure. Hell, most of my mates already are CFC fans, so it's not really a matter of needing people to meet up with, more a matter of letting others join in and make the events we have even bigger.

I guess my issue with the card is that the USA store is run by Sports Endeavors, whom I will never do business with again. They have horrible customer service. Their sale prices are often times still above regular prices elsewhere. They have gotten my orders wrong multiple times. I'd much rather order from Kitbag as they have much better customer service and actually lower the cost of items to offset the cost of shipping. I've never had a wrong order from them either. One time I got a long sleeve jersey that had a tiny tear in the seam of the sleeve, less than an inch I'd say, I emailed them with photos and within 24 hour they had another one on the way. I asked if they would be providing a way to send the damaged one back and they told me to keep it. So I basically got a free jersey with a slight tear in it all because of their awesome customer service. Even if I were to sign up, I still would not use the $10 card to the megastore. I don't see why Chelsea doesn't just also use Kitbag for their US store, as Kitbag already ships here and is a much better provider. I think it's awesome that the club provide these and I'm sure many people enjoy receiving them. It's just not for me.

There just needs to be more of an appeal to me. As it is right now, I'd basically be paying $10 to keep doing what I'm already doing.

Spearing was considered a decent backup to Lucas after Lucas was injured and a lot, in fact the majority, of people on this subreddit believed he to be the one to replace Lucas for the time being. Now we see that maybe he wasn't the guy for the job but at the time he wasn't doing so bad. Downing hasn't worked well with Carroll that is why he gets subbed off when Carroll is on at times. Trial and error. You can't force something that isn't there. I was just saying that's why Downing was so heavily sought after.

His legacy isn't going to shit and nor should it. He's a brilliant man who has done wonders for this club and wants to do more. Again, why are you judging him on one season, in particular half of one season? He wasn't doing so bad in the first half was he? Won at the bridge didn't he? Won at City I believe too.

Spearing was alway seen as a bit of a joke between everyone I know who supports the team, the weird looking woolyback whose heart was in the right place, but completely lacked skill, I don't know one fan who wasn't flabbergasted that Dalglish didn't bring in any reinforcements in January, even though it was glaringly obvious that he needed them, even if they were loaned players, it was obvious cover was needed.

His legacy is damaged, not irreversible damaged, but still damaged, he steadied the ship, and i am grateful for that, he had a go, but wasn't up for the job, step down and go do something more suited to his skill set, he is brilliant man to have around the club, and would make a perfect academy boss or scout, but he isnt the man to take this club back to the 4th spot, i dont believe his job at Liverpool is done, but i dont think it is in this role.

Daleks and Borgs are both cyborgs that attempt to be the most supreme being in the universe. However, borgs do this by assimilation and adaptation -- attempting to forever improve themselves by incorporating the technologies. 

Daleks already consider themselves supreme, and, with the exception of the Cult of Skaro, never adapt or upgrade themselves. 

Initially, the Daleks would be more powerful, as their time travel technology and vast knowledge of space/time and teleporting would be too good. However, once the first Dalek was assimilated, it would be game over. Borgs are a hive mind so the assimilated Dalek's knowledge would immediately become the borgs and they would adapt their technology throughout the whole collective. Then it is super borg versus daleks and that one goes to the borg.

There is an episode of Voyager where a super borg is created, but has to sacrifice himself for fear that him being assimilated would immediately allow the other borg to create a super species. So, it is cannon that Borg adapt like this to advanced technologies.

Then again, if you rotate the picture 90° clockwise, and place a mirror along the bottom edge, the yellow flowers at the front almost seem to spell out ""-ΣΘ"" vertically - meaning that the Doctor was *already* dead.

Then, if you put the mirror in the middle of the drum head, the words ""DOUBLE HEARTS"" become ""DOIIBIE HE◊BIE"". Apparently gibberish, but let's look a bit more closely:

DOIIBIE

DO II B I E

DO 2 Be 1 E?

Are two of these people really one eternal?

HE◊BIE

HE Be 1 eternal.

The diamond here clearly indicates Pertwee... who died six days after McGann's debut as the Doctor. In a sense... Paul is dead. He died as Jon Pertwee, then took on his new identity as Paul McGann.

But maybe that's not the only message we're being given here: The Cyberman interrupts the flowers which form the word ""TARDIS"", separating the first two letters. The yellow flower patch creates another division between the D and the I, making the text read ""TA RD IS"". Coupled with the earlier clue about ""-ΣΘ""... ""Ta, RD is -ΣΘ""... Russel Davies is the anti-Doctor?!

A big forward would be the key to all of it, if we can somehow get Ade on the cheap and then add another we could be set up nicely. i think they need to finally bite the bullet and splash some cash on someone be it Llorrente, Remy, Damiao, Dumbia,  Van Wolfswinkel, De Jong or any of the other dozen or so strikers we are seemingly enamored with each week.  Just get pull the trigger.

We need to take what is offered for Bentley (c'mon QPR i'll carry his bags over if you take him), Bassong, Gomes, and Gio (i think he has value but we are never going to play him) rather than Levy stalling for more and more money.  these are not guys you hold out for big payoffs for

We do that, pick up Ade cheap (8mil?), Vertongen (8mil seems about right) and Hoilett on free, and Damiao or Remy (18mil?) that would mean we would have stocked our team for about 30 of the 50mil we are always rumored to have but never seem to spend.",0,1336419760,null,0,false,0,c4l7q6s,t3_tbdlv,t1_c4l7q6s,t1_c4l78zx,null,1428876152,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,lol_oopsie,null,null,"I remember that we wanted to put up some coat pegs in the break room. It was going to cost £200, because we couldn't just put them up ourselves with two screws. You had to hire the licensed contractor specified by the hospital, and they would charge parts + labour.

We also wanted a bench moved, and that was going to cost £1500. In fairness it was a big bench attached to the wall, but I'm sure it took the guy less than 2 hours to move it.

Admittedly, that all sounds bad, but it did mean that we had lots of new multi-million pound hospitals built within a short time. So it's a toss-up really. I can't guarantee that what I saw extends across the whole NHS. Maybe it was only my local PCT. Maybe it was only that hospital. I don't really know for sure. But I do know that that hospital, and it's patients, would have been better off if it was run by a businessman.

I know some countries like Taiwan have an excellent mix of public and private care. You can buy health insurance and the market is very competitive and their standard of care is excellent. Everybody pays into a national insurance scheme (sort of like the UK) and in return you get a good basic standard from the government, and then you can pay to upgrade certain things or go to a private hospital. The end result is actually incredibly efficient and that sort of system makes the most sense to me. It hasn't created a horribly divided two tier system - it's very well balanced as far as I know.

Put it this way - I'm sure we all agree that government is usually horribly incompetent at big projects. And the NHS is by far the largest, longest-lasting and most expensive project in the UK.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"I am *so* glad somebody for once asked this! Any love for Davros? Yes. *Yes.* and uh...YES!

But really, he's my favorite character so much. The audio stories by Big Finish (licensed by the BBC) cover Davros' past. The main body of his past is in the special *I, Davros*, which outlines his childhood and up to his appearance in the 1975 story Genesis of the Daleks. You find out why he gets crippled and how he develops the beliefs and morals he has.

And in later stories there is even more character fleshing out. There's the villain trilogy story *Davros*, *The Juggernauts*, *The Curse of Davros*, *The Davros Mission* (this one's kind of...urfff though), and the story *Terror Firma* where Davros really really does go bananas. Pretty much a nice bridge between the insane Molloy Davros of the tv show and the even insaner Bleach Davros of 2008.

Davros gets so much character depth in the dramas. He's no longer a ranting villain. He's got a personality, you can see the (misguided) reasoning in his beliefs, his motives. He has the most amazing/terrifying villain cackle ever, and the most amazing motive rant- this thing seriously gives me chills. Just turn off the lights, close your eyes and *listen*.

true,cathalhenry,lfc12,,"Dalglish should stay. The results have not been great this year and the league position is unacceptable, but I believe he should be given the time to fully realise the project he has taken on.

The run of poor form can be traced back to the loss of Lucas. He was the hub of the team, repeatedly winning back possession, starting off attacking moves and covering the defence. If you recall, he had Silva in his back pocket when we played City. When we lost Lucas, we lost balance in the midfield and started leaking goals through an increasingly exposed defence. Gerrard and Adam are both too offensively minded to play together, as is Henderson to a lesser degree. Spearing, I'm sorry to say, isn't good enough and will probably be sold/loaned out in the summer. We should have signed cover in January and were linked with Seydou Keita, who I think would have been perfect, but for whatever reason the club or the manager chose to put faith in the squad we had.

I'm not saying it's all down to losing Lucas, but that was a big factor. We've been incredibly wasteful with our chances, not to mention unlucky with the woodwork. The squad desperately lacks width, with Kuyt, Maxi and Bellamy constantly cutting inside when on the wings, forcing Suarez to go wide looking for space. We also lack pace overall in the squad, with Downing and Bellamy the notable exceptions. That will probably be addressed in the summer with the addition of a winger and possibly a striker should Kuyt be sold.

Overall, I think that despite the horrendous league form we've had, there are green shoots of recovery evident in the squad. The team is playing a lot better that they were for the past two seasons, we have a solid defence and the front line might just be starting to gel. A few players will be shipped out in the summer (probably Kuyt, Maxi, Spearing and Aqualani and Cole). In will come a new winger, defensive midfield cover and probably a striker.

As for Dalglish's media persona, I really couldn't care. He's often overly defensive, but he's just trying to protect his players, which I'm sure they appreciate. Besides, Fergie's infamous tantrums in front of the cameras have never affected United or their fans, so why should we care what people think of Dalglish? All that matters is that he's a good manager, which he obviously is. Also, it took Fergie five years to win a title with United.

There are, of course, lots of things wrong with this idea; it's far from perfect. Grade inflation means you can't reliably compare anyway but grade inflated differences are probably less diverse than normalised ones. Changes in the syllabus mean grades can give you no insight into 'what' a student learnt, merely how well they did so and differences between teachers/schools/finances mean you can't compare people's ability to learn, given that they may have vastly different opportunities.

There is nothing, I repeat nothing to say the government are planning on cutting the total budget for spending on disabled people, of which these factories comprise up to 20%. The government has to ensure the tax payers money is spent responsibly, and spending quite so much cash in order to provide sheltered employment to a few thousand people is hardly fair on everyone else.

So there have been reoranisations in the past, but despite a 50% subsidy some of the sites aren't even breaking even. Now I work in a factory, and I can tell you that if your staff aren't even doing enough work to break even, let alone 50% of the work required to break even, you've got to have a lot of people sitting around doing nothing. Might not be their fault; may have nothing to do with their productivity, but that there simply aren't enough contracts coming in to keep everyone utilised. Doesn't matter.

Southern and Eastern Britain has not been watered properly for a few years now. It's going to take more than just a month long dousing to sort it out. The ground is too dry to absorb water easily, so it's more likely than usual that the water will run away into a river and out to sea or get dried up.

Yeah, I'm getting frustrated here. I'm not taking it out on you specifically, but you happen to be here to hear me rant so I might as well go on with my rant.

I mean, just saying, ""Oh it's *David Tennant* so it must be upvoted."" Well gee. I should go upvote a post of Agatha Christie here because Doctor Who did one of those stories. Or anything wild west? Doctor Who did a wild west in the 60s and it's gonna do one next season. Because c'mon, *they're wild wests*. And ""Agatha f!cking Christie"". And how about robots- Doctor Who has robots- let's put a picture of a Borg next to one as well. Or this statue-that reminds me of weeping angels because weeping angels are so kickass. And this pencil because the design on it looks like Gallifreyan, and Gallifreyan is kickass. Catherine Tate doing that school girl skit with David Tennant. They were both in Doctor Who. I mean this isn't Doctor Who but it *reminds* you of it. Why post things about Doctor Who when you can see things that remind you of Doctor Who?

Downing and Enrique were having a laugh on that left side, never really getting the ball into the attackers. Suarez wasn't getting the service he needed. 

Proud to see the team actually show up once Carroll was brought on. He was great. Really showing his passion and determination. Which got the rest of the team fired up. 

Really should have started Carroll and Suarez I guess. And tried giving Maxi a go after his previous goals against Chelsea this season.

As for the Goal-that-never-was... well at the time I thought it was in (of course I'm going to say that though, right?) and from some angles I think it does look to be in... others I'm not sure. 

Would have been great to win two cups this season, would have made up for our league position. However getting one cup win and to the final in the FA Cup is a huge improvement from last year.

[Here's a useful link on the issue.](http://www.findlaw.co.uk/law/family/marriage_and_civil_partnerships/500385.html) Essentially in all legal senses, CPs and marriage are the same. However, though I would like to hear if I'm wrong if anyone feels or knows otherwise, as the link points out the main issue is due to the objections of (some, but really no that many and mainly only the top end) religious folk. In fact I have heard tell, though it makes zero sense to me, that civil partnership ceremonies cannot legally have any sort of religious music played (though that could be only if the CP is taking place in a religious building) - I need to check that. [This BBC article also details a slight difference between the two](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/4497348.stm): ""... couples can essentially become partnered in private, if they wish. In contrast, a marriage happens when the partners exchange spoken words and also sign the register.""

On a related note, there's a strange kind of double-think that goes on in the minds of people who don't want to allow gay marriage: They argue that that civil partnerships are the same thing as marriage, but the idea, sanctity or *term* 'marriage' needs to be protected for straight people. But... if that were the case - that CPs are exactly the same as marriage in all but name - then there'd be absolutely no reason not to call civil partnerships marriage!

As such, it's really rather clear what the real reason is behind now wishing to allow gay people to marry. If anyone wishes to contradict that then I'm open to alternatives. So far as I (and many others) can see, it's simply bigotry/homophobia, though it's often refuted (unconvincingly).",0,1336435520,null,0,false,0,c4lb915,t3_tbl8u,t1_c4lb915,t1_c4laz00,null,1428877799,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Claiming we're not the type of team that throws money around when outside of the last few years we've been one of the world's top spenders just makes us all sound a little ridiculous.

Despite the praise showered on him these days - and we certainly appreciate being one of the better run clubs in the league - Levy has consistently failed to back Redknapp in the market for two years now, and where he has backed him he's been late to the party which has had it's own effect.

We're not struggling in the same place we were a couple of years ago - the team, and the team's performances, have become expontentially better. A couple of very poor months which have seen the team negatively effected by forces off the pitch and you fairweather fans are ready to jump on anything. You recognise that we're seen as a big club now right? You recognise that most other clubs in the league approach games against us very differently to the way they did two years ago? You realise the jump from Europa League regulars to Champion's League regulars is a huge one, one that completely changes the way you have to be able to play football? Because if you understand football well enough to see all that I don't see how you could possibly feel justified in saying we've stagnated under Redknapp.

No, Redknapp's not perfect, we all know that and no one's pretending otherwise. But has he done enough to earn his role with the club, to retain it for at the very least another go next season? Easily. Maybe try showing a bit of loyalty to the man who's taken us a long way already - he's not my first choice either, but he deserves to be where he is now, and for now he still deserves our support.",0,1336444796,null,0,true,0,c4ldaxq,t3_t9rt0,t1_c4ldaxq,t1_c4l2aek,null,1428878839,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Actually, before that someone tried to start me watching Doctor Who with The Eleventh Hour.  It kept me from watching the show again for a few months.  The episode begins as a ridiculous comic routine, which I loved after having the context of the previous seasons and knowing what was ahead, but hated when it was my first introduction.  The whole regeneration thing didn't make very much sense without any context, so it fell flat.  Also, the ""trust me I'm a Doctor"" line made me want to throw something at the screen.

Also it is important to note have the numbers been standardized for an increase in the number of people taking exams. That is one quote which can quite easily be taken out of context. Was the French exam the highest level of retakes, in the middle or the lowest? As well as that, how long has the number of resits been at 6. If it has been for the last 10 years then every person has had the same equal opportunity to get the better grades, therefore no inflation.

I am unsure where your second point came from, arguably those with involved parents and tutors will still have those people involved regardless of the number of resits.

Horny teenagers have been watching porn *in some form* for as long as porn has existed. Here lies the crux of the problem what the government is ""looking at"". If you have a regulation that you can't use a mildly racist word in a shop any more or there is a health campaign about cigarettes, alcohol or fatty food the daily mail is up in arms about ""political correctness gone mad"" or ""the nanny state"". Yet this they support? Lying, manipulative, fascist fuckwits.

This is an example of state ""nannying"" or social engineering. I don't have a problem with social engineering because people are basically thick; to paraphrase men in black an individual is smart but people are dumb. Sending more poorer kids to better schools is a good idea, or maybe teaching language at a younger age. But the thing about this is it has a measurable outcome. You can design a test for it; there are rates that exist at the moment, insert some change, balance out other factors and then draw a conclusion in a few years about the successfulness. This can be based on evidence or gut  instinct but its all measurable.

How many children are looking at porn at the moment?

There is no reliable measure.

What is the damage looking at porn does to children?

Unknown - hard to design a test for this.

What happens if children look at more or less porn?

At a guess they probably wank at about the same amount. Wanking is fine, it might calm those little perverts down.

Civil servants and people in government know all this; they aren't *that* dumb. So what's the point in it? The only reason I can think of is to win votes or get a poll increase.

Its the same for all drugs tests - cannabis stays in the system longer than any other,

That's why in jail it makes more sense to take heroin /cocaine/ crack than smoke a joint (a really good example of the reality of the effects of drug testing...) 

i.e http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2307373.stm

Drug testing in jails has lead to far more people becoming heroin addicts.... (is that what we really want?)

So this law 'may' lead to an increase in hard drug users on the road  - great.

* Divorce papers (if you are divorced)
* Certificate of No Impediment

If any of these documents are in a language other than English, you will have to provide a notarised translation (at your cost).

If you are getting married in England or Wales, you should contact the Registrar for the location where you'll be getting married. There are some additional legal requirements about the length of time you have to be resident in the area before marriage.

If you are a non-EEA/Swiss national, you'll have to go through these visa applications:

Fiancé visa: http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/partners-families/citizens-settled/fiancee-proposed-cp/apply-visa/

This visa is for the fiancé of a person who is already settled in the UK. This will allow you - as a fiancé - to come to the UK with the intention to marry and settle in the UK. You cannot work while you are on a fiancé visa. 

Once you are married, you will have to apply for a Settlement Visa: http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/partners-families/citizens-settled/spouse-cp/

The settlement visa will allow you to live and work in the UK for two years - after which you can apply for permanent residency.

Paul Robinson is interesting. Former England international, at 33 (same age as Doni I think) he could possibly be a decent backup, if he'd be ok with that. Don't know much about his personality and how he'd get on, but he's experienced. That being said I was thrilled with Doni's arrival and I think he's a better keeper than Robinson and I hope he stays... Reina is only 30 and with a longer shelf life than most positions I think he will remain one of the best keepers in the game for at least 4 more years. Even with some of his errors this season and suggestions he's past it, if I were in charge I'd still try to hold on to him as long as I can. 

Taiwo is a decent shout as well but isn't he only at Rangers on loan? I think Jack Robinson will turn out to be a good defender. Obviously backup to Enrique now, but maybe he'll get a good run of games in preseason, in cups, and Europa but if Taiwo was cheap and willing, competition is competition.

Holden looked goooood before his injury, but he's coming to a pretty crucial period in his career where I don't think a step up is where he needs to be.

There are three possible answers. 

The first is that it's known that it's possible for a Time Lord to get a new cycle of regenerations. The Master was given a new cycle as a reward.    

The second is the possibility that the 12 regeneration limit was imposed by the Time Lords.  As they aren't around they can't impose it any more.

This is your problem.

You're looking at phones as ""cheap deals"" when in fact you're tied into a long contract and pay more over the duration.

I have a Desire and love it, but it seems to be getting short of storage space at the moment - I'm a really light user, so I guess it makes sense you'd be frustrated with it if you use it more. 

However, I paid out cash for my phone, about £280 from O2 (admittedly, that was a good deal at the time) and I've been on a £10 or £15 a month simplicity deal ever since.

The cheapest contracts that gave a ""free"" Desire at that time were c £35 a month - many of those had an upfront cost, but based only on the monthly cost difference between our contracts, you paid at least £480 for your phone over that period.

You're allowing Orange to dictate the terms of your contract. If you're able to make buying a phone into a larger out-of-pocket expense then they'll no longer have any hold over you and you'll be the party then able to dictate terms. You'll be able to upgrade your phone any time you like by selling your unlocked free-from-contact phone on eBay, and secure a better price for it because you won't be selling at the same time everyone else is coming out of contract.

Mobile phone contracts are a mug's game. ",0,1336476230,null,0,false,0,c4lhm84,t3_tc02r,t1_c4lhm84,t3_tc02r,null,1428880867,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

From Wolves, I'd have Jarvis and Fletcher.  Jarvis is someone I've thought could do a job for us for the past couple of seasons - 7 goals and 6 assists this season in that Wolves side is nothing to sneeze at.  Some with Fletcher, could be a very decent backup striker and maybe more.

I really like the idea of Dempsey plus another midfielder or two, like maybe Elm and a dedicated winger to boot.

He's probably got 3-5 years of his best play in front of him still, and he's equally talented in midfield and as a striker, so he would be a very useful guy for weathering squad shake ups during the long season.

Firstly.
&gt;When my son said that he didn't have a land line

That makes it kind of hard to call people for a start.

Secondly.
&gt;and the phone was going to be 'subsidised' not covered fully

I'm not privy to all the details, but from what I understand from talking to my son the cost of actually making a call was going to be paid for by him, and would only be covered if he made a sale or whatever.  He would have had to cover the cost of installing a landline (minimal, but he's on JSA so not exactly loaded) and anything else he needed.  If he didn't make any sales he wouldn't get any money and would still have to cove the cost of the calls.

Also from my own memories of trying to get an old employer to let me work from home they have a requirement to make sure that your 'workspace' meets the same criteria regarding seating, lighting desk space and H&amp;S etc as you'd expect in a corporate office.

When my son first met with telesales guy at the job fair he said at the time that he wasn't interested after explaining point 1 and hearing point 2 above.  The guy then called him up and threatened him with sanctions if he didn't sign a contract with him.

So in other words, this guy is looking for people who will make free phone calls for him, and only pay them if they manage to sell whatever it is he's selling, leaving them in a potentially worse situation than they were in on JSA if they don't sell.  He's perfectly happy threatening people who don't toe his line and seems to be unaware of his requirements as an employer.  I sure as shit wouldn't want to work for him.

I agree that kind of stuff does no harm, but unless your brother had some pretty nasty stuff from Germany I'm guessing the porn was regular stuff available in a UK newsagent. That stuff is very tame, bit of nudity and maybe a hint of penetration.

Compare that to the videos that can be easily found online. Even mainstream American porn shows many pron stars being treated ""roughly"" which is fine if that floats your boat but do we want kids to see that and think it is a normal way to treat your sexual partner? 

&gt; Yes there's some crazy shit in porn that is disturbing, but there are also movies, TV shows and even books which are extremely graphic and violent. 

Yes, and access to such things is traditionally restricted. I know the internet changes the playing field and that regulation is not the key but to dismiss things out of hand doesn't help either.

By Nick Harris

SJA Internet Sports Writer of the Year

8 May 2012

An extraordinary letter written in late December by Blackburn Rovers’ deputy CEO Paul Hunt to the club’s owner, Anuradha Desai, has laid bare the crisis that has been gripping the club all season.

The 2,500-word document, dated 21 December 2011 and written just hours after Rovers had lost 2-1 at home to Bolton on 20 December, details financial problems then afflicting the club, hints at a massive rift between the owners and other executives over the future of manager Steve Kean, and implores Mrs Desai to allow people she had appointed – Hunt included – to run the club.

Blackburn have never appointed a CEO to replace John Williams and so Hunt has been in de facto control at Blackburn since his own appointment last year. What the letter clearly shows, however, is that ultimately control has always rested in India.

Sportingintelligence, which has authenticated the letter as genuine, has had sight of the letter and understands it is in circulation and is likely to published in full imminently.

Hunt begins by writing: “I have been your senior officer at the club for six months now and I feel that I must now write to you to ask you to make some significant changes to save the club, perhaps from relegation but also perhaps from administration.

“In 20 years of the Premier League there has been only one side that was bottom of the league at Christmas that has survived relegation at the end of the season.

“With the bank closing in, I fear that they will look to foreclose and have the potential to implement financial restrictions upon the club that could (as a worst-case scenario) enforce administration.

“I have kept quiet for a time now out of utmost respect and I trust that you realise that I am only emailing you now as I want what is only the best for Blackburn Rovers and the owners.

“I am very much of the opinion that we can save the club and I have always been very supportive and positive towards the owners. Therefore I hope you know that what I am saying is considered, honest, constructive and from the heart.

“I ask that we instigate all the changes below in this 10 point plan.”

Regular readers of Sportingintelligence will know many of the key development’s in Blackburn’s story under Venky’s. AN ARCHIVE OF STORIES IS LINKED HERE.

Paul Hunt’s 10 point plan to save Blackburn appears to be the last throw of the dice by an executive deeply concerned about turning around a troubled ship.

Unfortunately for fans – who saw their club’s relegation confirmed last night – he was ignored.

The 10-point plan seeks clarity on Hunt’s own position, and then moves on “Owners to invest in the club”.

That section says: “As you are aware Barclays have asked for the owners to put £10m into the business. This needs to happen and I am confident that this could only be a loan as we would increase the value of the club significantly. With all the speculation in the press the playing staff value and overall club value is depreciating on a daily basis.

“By putting an end to this the owners would be protecting their investment, putting their trust in the executive team and the club. The position with the finances is a cause for grave concern.

“Auditors KPMG have put as many obstacles as they can in the way of signing off the accounts due to their concerns. We continue to try and work with Barclays but they are very quickly losing patience as we cannot give answers. We have been forced to agree to additional spending against our wishes (Christmas hampers, sponsoring the Princes Trust event etc) and I am fearful that the situation will only get worse.

“During January we need additional funding to pay wages etc.”

Point 3 of the 10-point plan is extraordinary and says Kean had not only lost the crowd but also the dressing room.

It says: “Publicly I have been asked to support the manager and I always have as I personally like Steve. I have supported him from the start and have been desperate for him to do well. However, I am now of the opinion that it isn’t working and he is ready to go.

“He has lost the crowd and as a result of this evening’s game has lost the dressing room as well – the players no longer want to play for him. It is a shame and disappointing but we must act now to save the club. The board should be asked their opinion in who should be the new manager.”

Point four asks Mrs Desai to allow her executives at Ewood to run the club, point five calls for a more cohesive PR strategy, point six calls for more trips by Ewood executives to meet the stayaway owners, point seven asks the owners to visit the club more and point eight asks for the Ewood executives to hire and fire – rather than Mrs Desai making these decisions.

Point nine says: “We are losing fans/customers at an alarming rate. I am very concerned that fans are voting with their feet and not attending, not purchasing and not engaging with the club.

“Research shows that only 5% of ex season ticket holders will ever return. We are losing sponsors and suppliers. I am concerned we will lose Umbro if we continue to manufacture Rovers shirts in India for the RoverStar programme. Their contract specifically disallows this and we are putting at risk £800k of annual revenue.

“The Blackburn Rovers and Venky’s brands are both suffering terribly. Whilst there are negative goings on such as protests, complaints, media stories, unhappy fans etc, then both brands are losing brand equity and consequently, losing value.

“I am also concerned that the Premier League will intervene soon as they may take the view that their brand is being tarnished by association too. It is all reparable of course but we must start to act now by building bridges with fans and the media as above.”

The letter finishes with point 10, essentially a drawn out message of regret that the owners have not allowed the club to be run properly from Blackburn. It ends: “I look forward to hearing your thoughts. With very best wishes for a bright future, Paul.”",0,1336481547,null,0,false,0,c4li6fc,t3_tcu5h,t1_c4li6fc,t3_tcu5h,null,1428881131,2,false,brfc,t5_2safh,2

[This](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/federal_budget_fy09rs12012n_es1li1n#usgs302) suggests the government spent 0.7 trillion dollars, so I'm assuming private healthcare made up the rest.

I'm not saying the NHS is perfect, but there's private healthcare too if you can afford it.

I don't know about the access to other drugs/treatments. It seems to me that pretty much anything is treatable on the NHS, it covers *most* on the UK's needs. There may be long queues, but those are normally for non-life threatening things. The A&amp;E will treat you straight away if it's life threatening. Need a hip replacement? Expect a wait.

Hello All,

As many of you know, i'm having to close down my Etsy store soon so i'm giving away much of my leftover Doctor Who decals. There are quite a lot of them so i'll be giving away a small few every week or 2.

*UPDATE: It's been a couple of weeks since and i've still fortunately got a few things up for sale, no idea when they will be taken down. Maybe i've fallen off the BBC legal radar*

**Today's Giveaways are;**

* 1. [TARDIS (blue)](http://www.etsy.com/listing/97815087/blue-box-decal-on-sale)
* 2. [TARDIS (white)](http://www.etsy.com/listing/97815087/blue-box-decal-on-sale)
* 3. Bunch of smaller Who themed decals
* 4. Bunch of smaller Who themed decals

I'd link to the items on my store page but they've been taken down. There are about a dozen designs left on my store, feel free to check them out on [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/shop/colincapurso).

I'll be following a similar format to my other giveaways. All you need to do is leave a comment here. I'll leave entries open for 24 hours. After that no entries will be accepted.

Postage is free and includes international.

(How it works behind the scenes: All commenter names are collected and then put into some software that spits people at random)

**TL;DR**

Leaving a comment enters you into the competition to win a decal

true,lol_oopsie,null,null,"I said ""good university"", not Thames Valley. A good degree *will* pay for itself by the very definition of the word ""good"" degree. You pretty much have to measure the outcome as a financial one. If you do a course which won't benefit you, that's a waste of money. And actually, by having to pay for it, you'll probably get less shitty courses at shitty universities because nobody in their right mind thinks that it will set them up for a good future.

But try getting an accounting job, working at a law firm or into any high-paying finance job without a degree. And the same for the vocations - engineering jobs want top degrees, and obviously doctors, dentists, pharmacists etc have special degrees. If you want to do any of those (apart from doctor/dentist!) without a degree you have to be exceptional. The vast majority of people come in through graduate jobs. And in any of those jobs, you'll pay off your 60k debt quickly.

To answer your points:

1. You didn't need a degree to do that job if they would accept experience as a substitute. And frankly that's a good thing. You saved 60k. I agree that too many people go to university and it makes most degrees relatively worthless. Other than the ones which pay for themselves.

true,TriFerret,null,null,"I agree that we don't need another striker. No no, put the lynching rope down guys! Let me explain-

Early on, our upfront was bad, Carroll and Suarez were like strangers. Neither of them were scoring on a regular basis. While Suarez still looked good, he had no backup and even Messi can't always do it alone. Carroll looked remarkably weak. Couldn't keep his feet, didn't look confident, couldn't win balls in the air and couldn't hit simple shots on target. He looked, frankly, terrible.

HOWEVER, we were asked for patience and patience we had. Since 'that' game at Newcastle, I've seen a transformation in Andy. He looks confident, he looks like he knows what he wants to do and how he's going to do it. He has developed an understanding with Suarez now, and Luis' runs are being timed and placed based on when Andy goes up for the ball. I very, VERY rarely see Carroll lose out in the air now when the pass has been a good one, he even dominated John Terry, who for all his flaws is still one of the most experienced central defenders in the country. When he scored his first goal, he made a TOTAL idiot out of Terry before letting it fly.

When he goes forward, he is now looking dangerous, he's not giving the ball away cheaply, he's not being out muscled even by the bigger defenders, and he is starting to read his team mates' moves and intentions fluently. When we first bought him, he looked every bit to be a total disappointment who wasn't even worth 10mil. But now, no matter how late it has come, he looks to me like he is becoming every bit the striker we were promised. Also notice how both his and Suarez's goal tallies have increased exponentially since he started to perform?

All that said, we DO need some redesign in the team. If we DO buy a new striker, we should look for a future prospect or an extra option, not an outright replacement, that change is unnecessary and far too costly. The real issue lies in our midfield. I wont write Spearing off for a couple of bad games, and bear in mind, next season he will be playing second fiddle to Lucas anyway so there's no need to waste there. What we do need, is more goalscoring midfielders, just for that extra option. 

As every season goes by, Gerrard will score less goals. We have to accept this, and if we want him to keep dictating games with his presence, we're going to have to find somebody who can do what he has done all these years so we can allow him to gradually sit deeper. Henderson was supposed to be the one who did this, and for all of Shelvey's promise, he is not ready to be in the first XI yet. THAT is the position I believe us to need to fill the most. As Sterling rises through the ranks, our wings are reasonably secure. We just need Downing to start delivering more stats really, because you can't really fault him that much, since he's assisted more shots than anybody in our team I believe, he's just been unfortunate to have seen nearly all of his set-ups wasted.

If Kuyt really does go, we will need to look for another super-sub to take his place. Besides that, there is no need for another season of wasteful spending. We HAVE the squad there right now, we just need Dalglish to start selected stronger teams and making more sensible substitutions. There is NO reason we cannot reach 4th place next season with very few changes to our squad.

Maybe I'm wrong... But I have faith in our lads. Let's hope I'm right. YNWA",0,1336484647,null,0,false,0,c4limkf,t3_tc3kh,t1_c4limkf,t3_tc3kh,null,1428881342,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

true,[deleted],null,null,"I watched him play in the Greek league for four years, so I know a bit about him. Though my team is PAOK, my dad's good friend is Panathinaikos, Cisse's old team. He had average wing support and good support from the center. Both of which he really thrives on. Spurs can have both, but are stronger from the wings. Give him through balls and he'll score. He's also very good at creating chances for others. Many times he would not score the goal but set someone else up brilliantly. He's not selfish and has a very good eye for passing in the box.

PAOK is traditionally very strong team defensively (though this past Europa League campaign they played more mid-focused) an Cisse didn't really have too much trouble coming up with goals. He was good for a goal and/or an assist almost every game. 

At QPR he had a rough start, and I think he's been frustrated by the lack of support moving forward. Give him a reason to play high up and he'll definitely impress. Personally i'd take him over Ade anyday. Ade is more internationally renowned and can play some amazing hold up play, but he's not reliable and not as clinical in front of goal. Not to mention Djibril Cisse would come for a small transfer fee and much smaller wages than Ade. I think he fits the bill at Spurs, and is versatile enough that he could back up a few different positions.

In Greece he played striker or left forward, but he can also play left wing or on the line just behind the striker. It would be possible to run:

Defoe
 VdV+Cisse 
Bale+Modric+Lennon
BAE+Kaboul+Gallas+Walker

With Bale and Lennon playing a bit farther back to give them enough room to really get forward momentum and feed balls into VdV or Cisse. 

Cisse isn't as much of a poacher as the other Cisse on Newcastle, but I think he offers more around the field. He can play many different positions and I know would be okay with playing half a season (spending the other half on the bench).

Also, the guy has a great attitude. He put a lot of effort forward in Greece and was possibly the league's hardest worker. We wouldn't really see the slump with him that we saw Bale, Modric, and Ade fall to. He always seems to be a pretty peppy guy and gives back a lot to his fans. On Twitter he'd always respond and talk to his fans. I once tweeted at him after he scored a winning goal against PAOK 'you bastard you took us out of second but that was a beautiful goal' and he laughed and apologized to me. He get gets pretty involved with the fans, akin to BAE but with a but better English.

That being said... FSG aren't ones to be afraid to make changes. If their new Director of Football (whoever that may be) and Dalglish don't get the best out of this squad and we see start seeing similar results next season?

Dalglish could be sacked by Christmas.

So you put Kalou out there? Who would you play over Sturridge? Your ""play well or you're off"" argument is an empty threat. What are you going to put Kalou on the right and Malouda on the left? Torres? If you think Sturridge doesn't track back then you should see what Torres does.

Mata has played brilliantly behind the front man I agree, he has also played brilliantly from the LW too. Right now it's simply a cost-benefit of playing him in the middle and Kalou/Malouda on the LW vs Mata on the LW and Lampard in the middle. I think we can both agree that the latter is far more favorable.

Not at all.

I do claim that. Online shopping gives people more hours to shop, makes available more products, and potentially helps them make purchases they might otherwise not have made (e.g. recommendations, ""similar to,"" etc).    

I know myself I have purchased things on Amazon which I likely either wouldn't have thought to purchase normally or wouldn't have the opportunity to purchase locally.     

As I said above, Amazon should pay Corporation Tax, but the quote doesn't talk about Corporation tax, and instead refers to Amazon's entire tax bill - which is factually misleading, just as it would be factually misleading if the local book-seller did the same.

My argument wasn't that Mata is better in the middle (which he is), but that he isn't good at tracking back when he plays on the left. Read my first post again. Read it. I suggested playing Kalou there instead. I disagreed with you about Mata being quick enough to cover Robben with Cole - he's not. Are you with me?

Secondly I said that playing Lampard too far forward strangles his effectiveness, which it does. Lampard's entire (goalscoring) game revolves around late, untracked runs into the area. He's nowhere near as effective when he starts too far forward. 

Nowhere did I say that your entire selection was wrong. You've imagined that. Read that first post again - what is in there that is offensive? What is in there that provoked you to call me a fool? What was in my third post to provoke the Sky/ESPN comment? Nothing.

My previous post was because of your sneering, arrogant tone. Quite how some bloke from Minnesota gathers the right to tell me that I get my opinions from watching Sky and ESPN is beyond me. Do you have any sense of irony? You're telling a season ticket holder at Chelsea that he's never watched Bayern Munich. You're accusing someone who follows Chelsea (in literal accord with the song) over land and sea that they get they get their opinions from Sky and ESPN. Do you genuinely not get how much of a hideous hypocrite you are with accusations like that? What on earth do you know about me to make such accusations? You were the one who started making it personal by saying that I was foolish. You were the one who made it personal by questioning my opinions, simply because I disagreed with yours.

You can do one of two things in your next response - apologise for being an arsehole or respond in the same way you have done (by not reading what I've actually written and going ad hominem). Number one and we'll move on, number two and I won't bother responding to you.

I dunno, we do need a striker, so it is kinda tempting...

I know Balotelli is a headcase, but he is young, hugely talented, and I could see him playing with either of our current forwards. Adebayor is another great striker, but I can't see him coming to Anfield.

Edit: Also, in terms of the development of the rest of the country, I really feel that the British government has got out of the habit of sensible long term investment in the economy and in the population. If you'll excuse a moment of wonkery, we now spend an equivalent amount on Winter Fuel Payments as University tuition (£2.5bn vs £3bn), we are failing to build a proper fibre optic infrastructure [for the sake of £1bn](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17954346), when the free bus pass costs £700m a year. Does anyone seriously think that those investment levels are appropriate? A well educated graduate class and a proper internet infrastructure will be worth hundreds of billions, perhaps trillions in future tax revenue, let alone private income, and yet our state is simply uninterested in the paltry investments required. Even the major infrastructure investments which are being made, like HS2, are of questionable value. £35bn is a massive amount to spend for the advantages accrued, compared to the alternatives above. We desperately need to move away from political tokenism, and towards sensible non-partisan decision-making.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"&gt; The terrain for the game will be a forest

And now we have the possibility of Vashta Nerada playing a role.

I think the silence would win, but not by killing anybody. All they have to do is keep things chaotic. What they do best is using their mental suggestion to their advantage. If they keep to themselves and only occasionally whisper into the ears of their enemies they'll be forgotten and can ride things out to the last man.

Time plays a factor in all this, as there are many different models of Daleks available. Daleks before the Time War could be taken out by tipping them over or beating them with a cricket bat while Time War Daleks are damn near indestructible.

Additionally, is everyone armed?

Time Lords seem to have weapons beyond normal means (De-Mat Gun, Whatever Rassilon's kill-glove was) and can theoretically use their regenerative energy as a weapon (the Master's Skeletor get-up in The End of Time, River taking out all those guards in Let's Kill Hitler).

Regeneration's going to play a big role. If the Time Lords can work together and protect each other, they have 26 lives between the two of them.

&gt; a computer that allows any item after a 30 second count down to be teleport into the cornocopia .

Any item? *Blimey*. A Time Lord could teleport a TARDIS in the arena and eith fly away, or if they're sadistic activate the weapons systems (this again assumes that the Time Lock does not factor in).

Here's how I see it playing out in terms of who dies:

* At least one of the UNIT soldiers dies first to prrove how dire the situation is (as usual).

* The standard Cybermen stand no chance against Daleks (as we seein Doomsday). Due to their lack of military cunning I can see them dying pretty early on.

* At least one silence is shot, either on purpose or accidentally. They are *really* not bullet proof.

* Sontarans likely have a good stand-off with the Weeping Angels. They're used to not turning their backs to their enemies. It's like they're trained for this sort of thing.

* Time Lord figure out a way to either escape or defeat their enemies.

This is where things get fuzzy, because whether or not the Time Lords get a hold of a de-mat gun or a TARDIS really decides the course of the battle.

You see, Angels are most likely to win, as they can never, ever die.

Seriously, River says it herself. Angels *cannot die*. They just turn dormant and wait. I think that since their statue bodies are merely what they quantum lock into, blasting them to rubble isn't actually going to kill them because the moment you blink they unlock right back to the way they were. When an Angel's an Angel it's effectively not alive, so it really wouldn't matter what state it's in (although I can see it using energy to reform itself once not observed).

So, bottom line I don't think the Silents would win. They might survive longer than you'd think they would but they are very, very vulnerable and so long as someone keeps them in their sights the Silents have no chance.",0,1336505029,null,0,false,0,c4ln3pc,t3_tcr1e,t1_c4ln3pc,t3_tcr1e,null,1428883523,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

You might be interested in [this study](http://www.scribd.com/doc/58973372/Street-Grooming-Study-2-000-victims-of-systematic-abuse) about street grooming which found that 49% of groomers were white and 46% Asian (5% other) but I'm guessing most of the 'Asian' category means Pakistani. They're massively over-represented in this particular type of crime but according to the police they weren't targeting specifically white girls. Rather, they were being opportunist and target areas where girls would congregate on the high street late at night - the vast majority of these girls happened to be working class, often from care homes and white. We know there was one (poor) Bengali girl who was raped but the vast majority were white. People tend to ignore the fact that they were poor and often from care homes and that middle class girls didn't fall victim to them. Instead they solely focus on the race of the victims. You wouldn't say they were specifically targeting poor girls would you, or girls from care homes?

They could do their lightning power, but I could see a Dalek, Cyberman, or even a Sontarin shooting a Silence once they saw it.

I think if you are in a battle for your life and you know everything else that moves is an enemy, you would just attack a Silence as soon as you saw it.  Remember, their hypnotize powers don't take effect until after you look away and forget them, so as long as someone sees them, they could attack.

I suppose the Silents could try to hide after someone sees them, but I don't really see them as the type to do that. I suspect they might last for a while, but I think they are not protected enough. They can be taken out by bullets, so I don't think they would win.

EDIT:
Maybe I just want to cheer for the underdog, but I think the Beast might have a more significant play in the game than you might expect.  We know the Beast can possess people (though not sure how powerful that possession is), He could easily possess one or both of the UNIT members.  We know the Beast had possessed the Ood as well, so he is capable of possessing not only multiple people at once, but aliens as well as humans. I guess we don't really know enough about him, but he could just possess everyone. His major weakness would be that he is a) human sized (does that limit his powers), and b) he wouldn't really have much protection in the forest.

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"The words ""disgusting"" ""disgrace"" are not what you should use right now. There is no need to win these last two matches. Risking it all for a potential fourth spot which will probably never happen in the first place.

If we had to win against this Liverpool side we would have had to field a much better team and guess what? **These twats are so pissed off for losing the final just half a week ago that they would have gone straight through the legs of some of our top players just for the sake of it.** This is exactly the reason they are playing like it is a champions league final for them. They are in utter regret mode for doing fuck all in the last match and having to watch Chelsea celebrate on every paper and TV channel they watch. 

Now you will say that ""Well at least they should have showed up"", well they did show up and they are doing what they can. These are players which have not played together. This is an untested line up. We were going to lose this match anyway if it was 1-0 or 6-0..it does not matter to us. Yes it is difficult as fuck to watch but instead of taking your anger out on the Chelsea players (which is not justified as they have given the fans a trophy just a couple of days ago and are in the final of the biggest club competition) you should use this time to laugh at the KOP. 

They are celebrating every goal like it is a goal in the F.A cup final. They are whistling and giving Torres the whanker sign when he has hit the post and top form. They think they are doing something amazing when it is in utter vain and nothing else. I am actually laughing at them because deep down they know they lost when it mattered, they know they are not in the champions league final, [they know Chelsea fielded 0 players who will start the final and could care less about them right now](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/td6as/match_thread_chelsea_v_liverpool/c4lnd1c) and they know that they are being treated like a bottom table team by the one of the clubs they mocked and laughed at to go down and out season after season.

So cheer on through the sun and the rain and do not give a fuck and let these twats have their moment (what Frank Lampard was doing on the bench). If this defeat gets you so pissed off at your own players then you really need to calm down.

However some are studio, but the in UK a lot aren't necessarily filmed in front of a studio audience, so you dont get the long pauses (like in the Big Bang Theory without laghter video), but have an episodes shown to audiences whose laughter is recorded and played over.

I'd recommend just watching and after a few episodes you'll get used to it. 

Creek and the other drama/comedies wont have it. I really cant recommend Jonathan Creek enough. I still hold out hope there will be some more one day.

Nope, but as a human being I have the inherent right to defend myself, and firearms are the best tool for that.

&gt; Guns simply have no place in a civilised society.

You're delusional if you think you (in Britain) or I (in America) live in a civilized society. The term ""civilized society"" is a misnomer, an impossibility. Bad people who are capable of completely unprovoked violence exist in both our societies, with the sole purpose of preying upon those who are vulnerable... and thus we can't truly say we live in a civilized society. You can pass as many laws as you like, you can put as many cops on the street as you like... but we will *never* live in a world where self-defense becomes unnecessary.

true,pbhj,uk,.,"This looks as dodgy as anything to me.

The owners can clearly transparently redirect any of your domain name queries anywhere they like. So, perhaps in a month they'll start nabbing your bank logins ...? I did check a few addresses with nslookup (against the IP address returned by Google's 8.8.8.8 DNS server) and they checked out (for now on a very limited set of domains). There's no way you'd be able initially that they're stealing your logins if they're savvy about it - download the genuine site, make a gateway, accept your login, perform a pass through and cream off your username+password.

**Why would you trust them not to rip you off?** If you check the domain it's registered through a US registry using whois protection. The site, in apparent contravention of EU law (as it appears to be a business whether for direct profit or otherwise), doesn't have any contact information or any person to connect back to.

If you do the nslookup for hulu:

    nslookup hulu.com 199.167.30.144

Then it returns an address of 24.29.138.24

This address bizarrely is part of ""Road Runner"" which is owned by Time Warner Cable which ""is a trademark of Time Warner Inc. Used under license. Road Runner is ™ and © Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc."".

So they're sending you attempt to access Hulu through Time Warner servers ...

On the Hulu site you'll notice in the FAQ that: ""Hulu brings together a large selection of videos from over 350 content companies, including FOX, [...] Warner Bros., TED and more."". So Warner are involved in Hulu and are hosting this passthrough service in contravention with the Terms of use of Hulu (Section 3). It seems that either this service won't last a day on that server or it's being done with Warner's help.

Stinks of a honeypot IMO. YMMV.

If you're going to use it then it strikes me the best way would be to manually query the DNS server and write in lines in your HOSTS file for each service you want to use and then continue to route all other DNS requests via a [more] trusted supplier.",0,1336509471,null,0,true,0,c4lo80w,t3_td1sn,t1_c4lo80w,t3_td1sn,null,1428884059,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Also, we never got any kind of closure on her love affair of the Doctor, nor did she even talk to Rory about what had happened before their wedding day.  She even kissed the Doctor on her wedding day in front of Rory, and they have never taken a moment for Rory and Amy to have a character building moment to discuss her actions.

In contrast the first time I was introduced to Donna in the Christmas special, I HATED her, I was praying she wouldn't be the Season 3 companion, and was so happy when she wasn't.  And then when I saw her return in Season 4, I was really worried, but after about 2 or 3 episodes I noticed how she was changing. The adventures she took with the Doctor humbled her. She still kept her attitude at times, but she was clearly growing as a character, everything that she experienced seem to leave an impact on her. It was also refreshing to have a companion that wasn't in love with the Doctor. She wasn't afraid to point out his mistakes, or even call him stupid. And the Doctor grew from being with her as well. He changed and learned from her as much as she did from him, and it was beautifully written and acted.

Donna has done so much more for the story and plot and growth of the show in one season than Amy has done in two. To me, Amy is a forgettable character once she is gone, but Donna has left a clear presence on the show.",0,1336512845,null,0,false,0,c4lp1fi,t3_td4bi,t1_c4lp1fi,t1_c4lkvbk,null,1428884429,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

same thread as with against Norwich and against Fulham. Kenny was forced to switch back to Spearing and Henderson for the cup final because of how poor Shelvey was against Norwich

Some facts from tonight:

* Dispossessed the most of any player on the pitch
* Made the most passes of any player on the pitch but had the worst completion rate outside of the front two 
* Despite 84 passes made not a single through ball to the front two
* Not a single 'key pass'
* Won a single tackle all game (not his role, but still)
* Crazy and rash challenges that should have seen him sent off

He is definitely not performing what his role should be in the side as a distributor. Look at his chalkboard, it is all either sideways, backwards or incomplete. Do not confuse running around, chasing balls down and enthusiasm for performance. The quarterback role in our midfield three has been a key problem for us all season and Shelvey definitely isn't solving it. All of our distribution today was either down the sides or through Henderson.

Same against Norwich, same against Fulham. He is trying too hard and not letting his natural game flow. I really think he needs a year at another EPL side to breed him into a rounded player will a fully fleshed out long-term role.",0,1336513978,null,0,true,0,c4lparn,t3_tdj5d,t1_c4lparn,t1_c4loki1,null,1428884558,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

I'm alcohol dependent ( or I was )  I've been off the booze for 5 weeks after an incident where I didn't get off the sofa for three weeks that landed me in hospital going through a major detox for two weeks with a drip in my arm feeding me hardcore vitamins and fluids under heavy doses of Librium ( of which I can't remember much ) and I can tell you that it's like knocking on hells door doing this. It's horrid. 

People think booze, yeah what's the big deal? Well it can be a major deal if it gets hold of you. In my case I was getting worse and worse over a steady period of time after being somewhat of an alcoholic ( as in not having a day off booze ) for going on 10 years. 

But, even if you don't think you are an alcoholic you can be and not realise it so yeah, it might have given her a pretty hard time to be honest, each person is different. The relatives death was obviously the trigger that made her stop, but that can make it harder, not easier as she obviously still wants to drown out this pain and has been doing. You don't have to be dependent to have a hard time getting off booze. 

I'd have thought as someone who works with substance abuse victims you would know this though?

It doesn't show that the tax cuts increase revenues, was my point. Three years on, Swedish revenues are still below what they were at the start, whereas many other EU and EEA countries saw their revenues increase since 2007, even despite the crisis:  Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Slovakia, Norway, Switzerland.

&gt;Well given Sweden is the only country in Europe running at a budget surplus, something that only happened after Borg took office and has not happened to geographically, politically and demographically identical countries(IE. Finland) I'd say it's a clear result of Borg's actions.

Yes Arsenal are very high up in my hated list but they do make the champions league season after season with little or not effect. The Arsenal squad does not have the mentality to win the champions league even if they have the talent. This is why Chelsea will win the Champions league before Arsenal (whichever year that may be).

A typical Arsenal season starts and their fans boast about winning the trophy. All high on their horse saying the youth is finally ready and it is their time. 

Arsenal goes into mid season and their fans boast about fighting for the title to the wire as they have started slipping up. 

The season goes into 3/4 of its length and they say ""at least we will qualify for the champions league surely"" because things have started going wrong.

Then when the season is about to finish their fans are biting nails and somehow make it to the last spots of the champions league and boast how they will win the league next season.

It has been for many years and has served us quite well, our whole infrastructure built in the Victorian times was only possible due to the industry and every period of strong growth in the last century has been reliant on it. With it being our biggest strength, when it goes wrong it also becomes our biggest weakness and affects everybody.   

It is immensely valuable to our country for many reasons, its a massive employer, gives us tax revenues that are dispersed around the country, funds our pensions, businesses and mortgages and is probably the only reason our country still has a strong standing in the world. 

The whole bankers are bad and should be blamed for everything is just an easy scapegoat, the crisis was due to a combination of many things including the general public borrowing too much, government not regulating properly and yes certain people within the banking industry operating at risk levels which were too high, prioritising short term gain over long term stability. But the only reason we are able to blame the industry is because we benefit so much when its doing well, if it was to leave tomorrow our country would be fucked.   

It is impossible to separate the industry from our countries future success or failure, as we are still borrowing to fund our deficit from the industry, our interest rates are determined by the industry, our businesses need funding from the industry, the tax payers own part of the industry and it pays a large proportion of our  public services through it's tax. 

I'm not really surprised that Cameron want's to protect it and an EU financial transaction tax would be a straight and simple transfer of wealth from London to the rest of Europe, hurting us pretty badly. 

We really need to stop this pathetic blame game of it's all those rich peoples fault and they should be punished"", because without them our country is never going to recover and move forward. We need to regulate them properly, use their services for growth and hope they recover with reasonable growth. As this is happening we should be looking to encourage other parts of the country to create industry clusters which balance the economy so that our reliance isn't so heavy on one sector.

true,Lekonua,cyberman,Cyberperson,"After a sudden massive radiation spike causes the TARDIS to go a bit wibbly, The Doctor finds himself in America in the year 2277. While the TARDIS cools itself down, The Doctor has decided to explore, learn about the time period, help anyone who might need it and generally get into and out of trouble in typical The Doctor fashion.
 

I am not allowed to use guns to hurt anyone or anything. (I can, however use them for practical purposes such as destroying landmines from a distance.) Any such weapons that come into my possession are immediately disposed of. I make it a point to avoid violence as much as possible. There is a ridiculous amount of running involved.


Unfortunately, armed conflict is pretty much unavoidable at times. I've allowed myself to use melee weapons under the pretense that I am knocking sentient enemies unconscious rather than killing them. (Even when their heads explode into bloody chunks.)


I also cheated my lockpick skill to 100 and gave myself 9000 bobbypins (so I can open any locks like I've got the Sonic Screwdriver.) I could have boosted science as well for hacking, but that seemed like overdoing it. Most of my legitimate skill points go into speech, science and repair. I've also been building up my explosives skill so I can disarm Megaton's bomb. Since that seems like something The Doctor would do.


Thought about a 13 death limit, but as bad as I am at Fallout when I'm allowed to use *good* weapons, I figure I'm gonna die a **lot** on a melee-only run.


I'm The Doctor, here to help.

Many join to be part of a force for good, that helps people in disaster zones using speed and resources that no charity possesses. They help bring peace to troubled regions, they protect civilians both at home and abroad.

A case in point: One officer I met did not join for the money. He had no need for it, his family were wealthy, and he had a job in banking open to   him whenever he wanted it. He joined, not for the poor pay, but to try and have a positive impact on the world, to be part of an organisation that makes a real difference in a way that no other organisation can.

Also, the pay is pittance. The highest ranking non-commissioned officer will earn around £38 000. By comparison, tube drivers will take home £55 000.

I remember one article that had stated the club had told him the week leading up to our CL game against Bayern that he wouldn't receive 6-7m in loyalty bonus because he had put in a transfer request in the summer. I would imagine that this upset Tevez, and him(or his agent Kia, a.k.a. third party owner) was not happy about this and we all know what happened next. The timing of his comeback also sparked my interest as he was gone for approximately 6 months and at 250 000 a week that equals about 6-7m. 


As for other punishment of his actions we the club fined him 6 weeks worth of wages, or 1.5m.

&gt; I have never bought into the hypocrisy of football but perhaps I’m more strident in my views now. I’m lucky and appreciate what I have, but football is just a job, a means to an end... there are more important things in life than kicking a ball around... Yes, I play for the money but then doesn’t everybody who gets up in the morning and goes to work? They do it to provide for their family.

Cardiff City football club is hard up for money, and a gazillionaire is proposing to offer 100 million euros to the club help out with finances, revamping the stadium and training facilities, etc.

The problem is that in return, he wants to completely rebrand the team (change team colors from blue to red, change mascot from bluebirds to red dragons, put red seats in the stadium, put a dragon on the crest, and so on). The money is great and could be very useful, but I do not think it is right to change 100+ years of history and alienate a great fanbase for short-term financial gain.

There is a reason why Chelsea and most other teams have had the same names and colors for so long. All of the clubs have a history and a tradition that is worth preserving, and that is why I encourage all of you to sign onto the petition as well.

Also, I selfishly do not want to be rooting for the Chelsea FC Rainbow Unicorns in 10 years time.

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"Not bad suggestions. Two cents:

a) I wouldn't bother with a new keeper this year - enough business on our plate already and Friedal clearly has another year in him.

b) Is Javi Martinez a CB? I thought he was largely a defensive mid? Certainly wouldn't be my first choice for a CB. Hopefully moot anyway with Vertonghen (fingers crossed) on his way - if that doesn't come off trying to convinvce Swansea to part with Williams could turn out to be a bit sensational. I'd also try sending Gallas on his merry way if possible, then if we feel we need cover dropping 6m or so on Figueroa (covers LB too).

c) Great centre midfield collection there - really looking forward to getting Huddlestone back - but a little worried that Livermore's going to miss out on a lot of opportunities. Maybe a loan for him, in the second half of the season anyway (Swansea would be ideal).

d) We're hugely unlikely to get Hazard, and 25m is a pretty low estimate of what he'll go for - chuck and extra ten on that I think. I'd say Krasic is worth a look for the RW - available, affordable, fast and direct, and I'm less keen to drop Lennon from the first XI anyway. Alternatively I'd have a good long hard look at Albrighton - he deserves much better than the current Villa squad and is capable of actually staying wide, on either side but the right by preference.

e) I think Pienaar might get us a little more than the 3m expected here, closer to 6m. I don't think Kranjcar is a good alternative to Bale, and although he's been something of an arse throughout his career so far I'd be tempted to try for Drenthe as back-up here - out of contract in the summer, clearly has the quality if Redknapp can wrangle him, has shown he's willing to come to the PL, and would likely jump at the chance to join a team at our level - also not so much of a risk given we won't be asking too much of him. If he doesn't work out I'm quite hopeful of Townsend developing well enough to take over for the following season, especially if he gets a good loan position next year (come on Swansea, educate our boys).

f) I'm not sure what it is about Hoilett but I'm just not quite keen. I'd be earmarking Kranjcar for the back-up support striker role, if only, if only. I almost feel he deserves better than not playing for us though, so if it came to it I think we'd get nearly 10m for him and Hoilett could turn out to be a great addition, and great value with the free transfer.

g) I'd rather keep Adebayor up front, though I completely agree with letting Defoe and Saha go (I doubt us getting 12m for Defoe though). Remy or Damaio first choices there for me - hopefully with Napoli missing out on CL the big boys' attention will be taken up with a Cavani/Lavezzi auction, giving us a free run at them - and I'd like to see Moses brought in too, 10m should do that. If we really can't do the Adebayor deal it's Berbatov I'd be looking to first, or maybe Kenwyne Jones.

Lots of business all in all, but it doesn't sound at all infeasible. It's nice to see just how much wage budget we can potentially free up, even with some of these estimates being a little low for me (I think I remember hearing Bentley's on closer to 65k for one).

Border Control are not under personned . What they do have is a poor allocation and usage of resources . They need to get their personal who are wasting massive amounts of time questioning legitimate travelers transferred over to passport inspection .

What they do at the moment is often to greatly piss off the people passing through the border and thus give the country a bad reputation . Compared to the ease of visiting other EU countries such as France the UK is a veritable prison .

They are not intelligence led , they have very low access to information , they just try to pester and bluff their way through . There should be a proper intelligence led process which would result in almost all people going through the border very quickly .

Travelers are getting very pissed off with the interminable questions and the massive delays - both of which are totally unnecessary in almost all circumstances . The hit rate of the Border Control officers is very small , mostly they miss - piss off the good people - the genuine tourist and business traveler etc. - and probably miss many of the very few people they should be picking up .

true,westbubble,null,null,"Hey mate, I recently finished University here in Oxford. However before we go along I did go to Oxford Brookes, the former Polytech. So my knowledge is limited about the actual University/Admission. But I can chip in with the other aspect.
Lets start with the weather, its actually a loooot less foggy then movies make it seem, I cant remember the last time there was fog. Rain also not a big issue, to compare it to my expirence in the States, about as much as in Virginia. But it is overcast just about every damn day, or so it feels. So no no worries burning up. Fake tan also a big hit here, I wonder why.

Student life here is very different from US universities, due to the nature of the colleges (which are far more independent than in the us and more like univeristies with their own, halls, rules, lecture halls) life is more clique and less communeral. 

I have friends at various colleges at Oxford and there is a strong rivalery amongst them I observed, and a distinct dislike between them. Again depending on the students. But it adds to the feel of isolation as there is no big community.

The pressure is high, you not only have to compete with the british studens, you compete with the best from the world and moreover Europe. Any European can study anywhere in Europe under the conditions of the locals, means scholarships, fundings, lower tuition fees.So yeah its tough. And they are snobbish, very caucasian centric, meaning borderline racist, unless you are a genius.

One thing I also realised is the pressure, it on, a lot of competition adding to the general spirit of me(us) against them.

Oxford as city is lovely but for any american standards its expensive how expensive. Well London is a good comparison or I would compare it to living on Manhatten Island going to Uni.

Now that sounds pretty bad, but I liked the place I had a good time here but it was not until I got to a US college (Virginia Tech) for an Exchange to realise how good a good US university actually is.

I loved the fact that education in the US is guided, and more like schoolm its less independent then here but more work. My experience here is you are on your own, its very independent and you need to be good in learning on your own terms. You need to be smart, being a hard worker will get you along only so far, its knowledge and intelligenceyou possess beforehand that will determine a lot of your success.

There are good things on both sides of the spectrum (US vs. UK University system). Its important to know what kind of person you are. But generally speaking I prefered the US, the close knit community and strong school spirit, excellent professors with a stronger focus on application.

If you like independent learning, theory, a generally independent lifestyle, being close to culture, art, history and simply gorgeous environment you will like it here.

I hope I helped a little, I will see if I can get my friend at Trinity to post on admitance/finances and oxford college lifestyle. ",0,1336543974,null,0,false,0,c4lvo9f,t3_te5dv,t1_c4lvo9f,t3_te5dv,null,1428887622,0,false,oxford,t5_2rc7b,0

true,thorva,null,null,"I went from American high school straight to Oxford, where I was an undergrad from 2004 to 2008. Since I've just gotten back from my [fake MA graduation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts_%28Oxbridge_and_Dublin%29) and am feeling nostalgic and generous, I will try to be thorough and respond to all your questions:

* The weather is about what you'd expect for the windward edge of Europe: very cloudy, frequent rain (though not much in terms of actual volume of water), and it is deffo colder than California. Trinity term (April–June) can get lovely and sunny, however; Oxford in May and June is one of the nicest places on Earth as far as I'm concerned.

* I never attended university in America, so half of my comparison is based on the experiences of my American friends and of my Oxford friends who were exchange students at Princeton, but I can say the following: there is enormous pressure to perform to an extremely high standard, but it is generally exerted by your tutors rather than your peers; actual competition among students was next to none, and I did a subject, law, where one might expect that kind of thing. That said, Oxford values self-motivation, intellectual self-confidence (which is not the same thing as arrogance or flippant belief in your own correctness), and independence of thought. If you do an ""arts"" (non-laboratory) subject, you will spend almost all of your time reading books and formulating written arguments in response to them. There is no spoon-feeding; no intro class. If that's what you call ""fun and enjoyment of actual learning"" (it certainly fits my definition), then yes, there most definitely is that.

* If I had to identify a single thing that made the difference between my getting in and not getting in, then it would probably be the fact that my greatest cognitive strength has always been the ability to pretty quickly distill whatever text I'm confronted with to its argumentative essence. Basically, in the law interview, they were testing analysis and critical reasoning, and that played to my strengths. Flawless test scores (IB exams are better than AP exams are better than the ACT is better than the SAT) are necessary and sufficient to get your foot in the door to interview: once you get to that stage, everything is considered de novo and the interview is dispositive of your application. My school certainly didn't have a damn thing to do with it; they had no idea what I was even trying to do by applying to college in England, and Oxford certainly didn't care what sort of school it was or even want to see a transcript of the grades they gave me. (That didn't stop my school from claiming credit when I got in Oxford, of course, but that's another story...) In short, you will be judged on merit whether you went to high school at Andover or on the set of Not Another Teen Movie or anything in between.

* The university itself does not provide financial aid to non-EU students. But as an Oxford student, you are fully eligible for US federal student loan programs. Go into debt, for fuck's sake. It's only your education and the opportunity of a lifetime. Much worthier a reason to borrow money than buying some shitty house, if you ask me.

* I like Oxford very much. Cambridge is also pretty, though it is smaller and feels less like a city. The rest of England is neither here nor there, really. Britain as a society is going through an enormous, rapid, churning transition right now, and it is largely very ugly, from the street level right to the top of the political system. Starry-eyed anglophilia is a shaky reason to want to do anything (much less commit to a university), and I would encourage you to investigate Oxford for its own sake and on its own merits — which are massive — and to go there if you want to be educated there, not because you ""love everything... you've ever seen, read, and heard"" about England. ""Seeing"" Wolverhampton or, shit, even taking the bus to Blackbird Leys in Oxford should put an end to that pretty quickly.

PM me if you have any more questions; I'd be glad to help in any way I can. 

And one last piece of advice, which I hope you will take in the spirit of helpful generosity in which it is proffered: retire the phrase ""across the pond"" from your vocabulary and receive 50 free style points.

&gt; the Laffer Curve. No, it doesn’t say (whatever certain politicians have said it says) that lower taxes always pay for themselves through higher growth. What it does in fact say is that there is a tax rate which maximises tax revenues. That there are one or more of these maximum revenue raising rates is simply a mathematical certainty. Taxes at zero and 100% raise nothing while as we’ve all noted governments do manage to raise tax revenues at rates in between. There is therefore a curve and curves have at least one maximum point.

true,Intrinsically1,lfc50,,"Interesting points:

* We have consistently made losses the past 6 years (apart from 2008 due to a net gain on transfers as Hicks/Gillette offloaded talent)
* Our yearly interested payments to service debt increased from 2 million/year to 45 million/year under Hicks and Gillette
* Under Hicks and Gillette we wasted over 60 million on stadium design write-off expenses and severed staff payouts in the 20 million range.
* Our revenue/match from Anfield related revenue sits at 1.5M, 5th in the league compared to ManU's 3.7M, Arsenal's 3.3M, Chelsea's 2.5M, and Tottenham's 1.6M
* Our new kit deal ranks us #3 of all football clubs in terms of sponsor+kit supplier revenue with an added clause under Warrior that allows us to further grow revenue in this area by opening our own retail stores to sell kit/merchandise.
* Most of our revenue growth has increasingly come from Commercial aspects (rather than broadcasting rights or matchday sales) and this trend is likely to continue unless a stadium is built in the near future.
* FSG *strongly* supports Financial Fair Play rules and operating within those guidelines, Henry being quoted as stating he wouldn't have gone through with the purchase of the club if he hadn't have believed they would be coming, adding he hopes that UEFA would be strict in their application (no loopholes - a la City's murky Etihad relationship)
* The owners desire a lower more sustainable wage bill and further development of our youth team to grow talent.
* Henry has learned his lesson on player signings - “Everyone is fixated on Moneyball or sabermetrics, but football is too dynamic to focus on that. Ultimately you have to rely on your scouting.”
*  When Henry bought the club, he confessed to knowing “virtually nothing about Liverpool Football Club nor EPL.” A year later, he said, “We have so much to learn about all aspects of the sport and we are still learning.”

In my opinion we shouldn't expect a large injection of funds for use this transfer season, but I think we all knew that.  Given the current cracks in our starting line up I am sure we will spend some money to pick up some smart purchases.  

We will likely see continued creative commercial revenue development from the owners.  They seem to be pretty cutting edge on this sort of thing and I have a feeling that we will be the trailblazers in this department with other clubs following our lead to bolster earnings.  This Fox Soccer TV mini-series is just the beginning.  Hopefully they keep it classy.

It will be interesting to see what they do about appointing someone to fill Damien Comolli's empty seat.  Hard to know what really went on with the signings of last year but if it was mainly Comolli calling the shots perhaps Daglish will be given more control and a guy close to him will be brought in.  The owner's plan will likely be more long-term.  If Kenny ends up going for whatever reason then they won't want a repeat of the severance pay the club lost to Hodgson and Benitez.  

As for Kenny himself, a lot of people forget that he has a history of simply burning himself out and leaving clubs mysteriously with his managing career which is worth noting (even with Liverpool, although entirely understandable given the circumstances).  Personally, I think he'll be with us for at least another season.  I don't see the owners reacting in a knee-jerk fashion.  The season has been disappointing, but I certainly wouldn't describe it as * disastrous* (despite routine claims after every home loss to a mediocre team).  

Very few of us are willing to face the reality that we simply do not have the ability to compete financially with the top clubs.  Chelsea and Manchester City are operating with absolutely *staggering* losses each season and additionally Tottenham, Arsenal, and particularly the Mancs (as always) are in increasingly good financial situations with CL money coming there way.  

On a final note, it's pretty scary that Henry admitted that he still has a lot to learn about the sport given his continued distant relationship since that time but he seems like he has a good head on his shoulders (*touch wood*).",0,1336547391,null,0,false,0,c4lw4nt,t3_tecdl,t1_c4lw4nt,t3_tecdl,null,1428887838,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

It's out and out racism. A group of men of one skin colour have preyed upon a group of young girls with a different skin colour because they think girls with the different skin colour are ""easy"" and ""up for it"" and beneath girls of their own skin colour.

Stop making apologies for racists because the racists have brown skin. Non-white skinned people can still be racist and calling them thus does NOT make YOU a racist. There's no need for any guilt about it.

&gt;When Greater Manchester Police did finally pass a file on Girls A's rape to the CPS the following year, a Crown lawyer decided not to charge anyone because he said she would not be a sufficiently credible witness to put before a jury. A second CPS lawyer backed that opinion.

&gt;It was only after social workers notice an upsurge in cases of child grooming that police reinvestigated and made a series of arrests which led to yesterday's convictions.

Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of campaign group the Ramadhan Foundation, insisted race was central to the crimes and blasted Muslim community elders for ‘once again burying their heads in the sand’.

&gt;Mr Shafiq, who was born and raised in Rochdale, insisted the case was about race. He said: ""There is a significant problem for the British Pakistani community. There is an over representation amongst recent convictions in the crime of on-street grooming. There should be no silence in addressing the issue of race as this is central to the actions of these criminals. ""They think that white teenage girls are worthless and can be abused without a second thought. It is this sort of behaviour that is bringing shame on our community. I urge the police and the councils not to be frightened to address this issue. There is a strong lesson (to be learned) that you can't ignore race or be over sensitive.

true,dangercart,lfc68,,"I'm not sure if you really have that power so...

I suggest that we should move Andy Carroll or, at least, sign someone to move ahead of him as our primary striker.  This isn't anything personal, I just think that he is a player from a different age who ties us to a rigid system that doesn't necessarily allow us to maximize the rest of the talent on the team.  Andy needs to be part of a 4-4-2.  He isn't mobil, creative or clinical enough to be the focal point of a 4-3-3 or 4-5-1 and most of the successfully European teams play one of those systems now.  I believe that Gerrard can't hold up to playing a full season as one of a two man midfield any longer and that Suarez is at his best when he is freed up to pull out wide and interchange with the other attacking players on the pitch (like what he does with Cavani and Forlan for Uruguay).

Beyond that, the faster pace of the game and tightening of refereeing decisions has increased the value of small, quick, attacking players.  Look at the personnel decisions made by City, ManU, Barca, Real, Juve and Dortmund.  They all have chosen smaller players as their primary strikers even when (in all cases other than Barca who chose to let Zlatan leave) they have bigger players who would be more of ""target men"" available.  Bayern have relied on Gomez but he is better than Carroll and, more importantly, is backed by three of a great attacking foursome (Ribery, Robben, Muller and Kroos) every game.  Milan and Chelsea build their attacks around classic target men who are better than Andy and neither of them won their league, either.  That's not to say a team can't win that way, just that the majority of the best run teams in the world have decided that it is not the way to play at this particular moment in time.

Like everyone else I am hopeful that Andy will succeed and become a Liverpool legend if they decide to move forward and build around him.  I personally do not think that is the best approach, though, and think there is an argument to be made that he has re-established his value over the last two months and it may be best to sell him now, recoup as much of his fee as possible, and look to bring in a more ""modern"" alternative that gives us greater tactical strength and flexibility.

If you ask me, the whole idea of ""marriage"" is stupid anyway. Especially as everybody just fights over the definition.

If you want everyone to actually be equal, just get rid of marriage recognition by the government altogether. Then allow the legally-recognised partnership of any two adult people. Then it doesn't matter if you're gay, straight or whatever. If you want to name somebody as your legal ""partner"" who has rights (i.e. power of attorney if you are ill, inheritance rights, tax-free money transfers, visitation rights in hospitals etc) then who is to say who can be eligible? Then, if you want to get ""married"" it can be a ceremony, celebration of your love or whatever that's fine, but it isn't legally recognised.

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"&gt; one main difference between us and you lot is the spending on transfers

Agree with that much. The rest of it, not so much. However, the FFP was (almost) immediately instituted to ensure that clubs like ours don't get an unfair advantage. Having said that, I am about to launch into a long-post about Chelsea pre-RA &amp; anno-RA and how (much) his entry has 'changed' Chelsea - to put it mildly. 

**&lt;TL;DR&gt; I guess what I am trying to say is that RA's money bought us talent that would have inevitably come to Chelsea eventually. It might have taken a few years longer but it would have happened nonetheless. Then again, ifs &amp; buts, so YMMV.**

**WARNING: LONG POST FOLLOWS.**

You must understand that, in the few years before Ranieri, Mou and RA came into the picture, Chelsea was more-or-less a mid-table (maybe, top 6 at a stretch) team. We had little to no investment in youth development*. Most of the youth talent around the area would inevitably end up with one of the other London clubs but I don't have to tell you that, do I? :-) 

^* ^(To further establish this, I would like to point out that JT has been the only club-grown player in the Chelsea squad over the last 10 years - speaks volumes about our youth development pre-RA.)

One of the better things RA's money and his high-value acquisitions did was enhance focus on youth recruitment and development. The new training facilities at Cobham were a direct result of his investments. However, new training facilities are pointless if you don't have the talent to utilise them, right?

Mou's entry saw us spending over a 100 mn to acquire the likes of Drogba, Essien, Carvalho, etc. and he ransformed this squad of stars to a team of winners. 

It was only then that the youth talent in and around London began to take Chelsea as a seriously big club. Now we have home-grown* prospects like Chalobah, Ake, Swift who could easily be in the starting XI in a few years. More and more youth prospects from the Chelsea academy have been making their mark and will see a lot of game-time in the reserves. 

^* ^(Yes, some of our youth talent - such as Piazon and Feruz - is still sourced from abroad but I would ascribe that to pressures of the FFP and lack of a proper local scouting network.)

Under Ranieri and Bates, we had gone from a mid-table team to a top-6 team. If the same trend were to continue, I would think that Chelsea would be regularly challenging for the title each season and may even have won a few trophies - not as many as we have now but still, we wouldn't have an entirely empty trophy cabinet, for sure. IMHO, RA's acquisition and his seemingly unending cash coffers merely accelerated that growth. 

DISCALIMER: SUBJECTIVE (AND POSSIBLY CONTROVERSIAL) OPINIONS FOLLOW. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK. YMMV.

What surprises me is when Bates' acquired Chelsea and pumped about 26 mn quid for Ranieri, no one claimed then that Chelsea was 'buying trophies' although 26 mn at that time was a pretty significant amount. Was it because he was English and not foreign? 

Sorry if that sounds sensational, but I had to ask the question because recent trends of club-buys in the PL have seen a marked antagonism from football fans against owners who are not English or American - Chelsea, Man City, QPR to cite a few examples. 

What is even more weird is that these 'foreign' owners have pumped in their own money into the clubs and these owners have taken on debts of the club but they continue to be taunted with terms such as Arab-money, El Cashico, Chelski - to name a few. I don't see many of their English/American counterparts doing the same - the Glazers seem to have worsened ManU's debt-crisis even further, if certain reports are to be believed. 

All of the above opinions (highly controversial and purely subjective though they may be) beg the question: 

**Which one would you rather have - a 'foreign' owner who loves the football club and willingly invests his own money into it or a local owner/controlling stakeholder who loves the club but doesn't seem to invest into it?**

Approximately 10 years ago (I will check with friend to confirm) my friend and I were studying for our end of year exams.  During this time we regularly visited spuds in the evening.  They had recently introduced champ to their menu at the time.  

My friends and I were big fans of chicken curry + chips.  One evening I was down with my usual Spuds buddy and feeling guilty about the amount of chips I was eating, decided to order a chicken curry champ which drew a strange look from Speedy (the small guy who used to work there all the time who died from an epileptic seizure I believe).

I realised the combination was delicious and encouraged my friend to try it the next time we were down.  If my memory serves me it was Margaret who served us the next time we were in. We both ordered chicken curry + champ and Margaret said something along the lines of ""Are you the boys who ordered the chicken curry + champ? That is not right!"".  We told her it was delicious.

Now they're struggling to find something to do. Why do they deserve the same as me? I made better choices, and worked harder. Why should I not be rewarded for that? Why do I not deserve a better outcome in return for my efforts?


Then there's the kid, like me who got straight A's in his GCSE's then when attempting his A levels had to deal with the reality of his mother being diagnosed with cancer, his grandfather dying followed closely by his dad losing his job and being forced to leave education to enter the workplace on minimum wage to support his family and probably, due to financial circumstances, will never get a shot at University. 

I can guarentee without a doubt that I have worked my ass off more than you will ever do in your entire life, yet you will do better than me due to circumstances beyond my control. 

So tell me, why exactly do you deserve more than me? Simply because you were/are in a better financial situation than me? And you're telling me socialism's unfair...

&gt;Socialism is the most unfair system that there is. The simple fact is that some people DON'T deserve the same as others

Don't generalise socialism with the qualities of Communism. Socialism =/= total equality. 

&gt;It's why this whole country is fucking poor and everybody is in debt and so many people don't even bother trying any more.

What the fuck are you talking about?
The people in debt, are those on minimum wage, why the hell would you even bring up people who earn over 45k?

Which in lies the problem, I don't think we would play him that much.  As it stands, we have Crouch, Jones, Jerome, Fuller, Walters.  Jones wants to start more, so does Jerome, and Pulis can't drop Walters or Crouch.  If we sell Jones then maybe we could get Lukaku, but Jerome would be annoyed so we would have to sell him too.  But again here is a problem, Pulis hates playing youths, now we have several half decent youngsters crying out for first team experience, Arismendi, Cuvelier, Lund, Brunt, Rossi, the first two I think should have been given some games this season.  It took out most promising youth player to turn 23 before he got given the chance in the team.

Yea having fallen in love with Athletic Bilbao this season Martinez is playing mainly as a CB, but then again the side operate a unique formation.

With the RM players I was thinking more we should go for a player who can play across all the att-mid positions, we need to get away from the rigid Right/Left.

Drenthe seems to be an infuriating player, clearly talented but when he wants to be. And after his time at Hercules clearly a bit mental.

Kenwyne Jones is a no-no for me, incredibly lazy and inconsistent we can do so much better.
