There are three ways of being a ""proper"" fan, apparently:

1) Go to games live, single game tickets or season tickets. Buy merchandise.

2) Go to some other club's home games and buy a season ticket for that said club. How does this support *our* club? Pray tell, since this is what *you*'re doing.

3) If you're an American (or anyone outside of London or England), I'm sorry, but you need to move to London/England. Quit your job, sell your stuff, sell your apartment, say goodbye to your family and friends, move to London/England, buy a new apartment, buy new stuff, find a job, go to games.

The internet enables us to consume an almost infinite amount of media. Why just check one news site and hope it's completely accurate? That's silly, and a waste of the resource you have at your fingertips. Use Al Jazeera, sure, but also look at the BBC, the Telegraph, the FT, the Economist, the Guardian, Bild, the LA Times - whatever's relevant.

All news outlets have a degree of merit. People love to emphasise how bad the Daily Mail is, but I don't think these people understand news. Sure, it's trashy, unreliable and occasionally deliberately misleading, but then so is the Guardian. If you take *any* newspaper without a pinch of salt, you're going to have a bad time.

Obviously it depends what story you're trying to follow, too. Al Jazeera is great for Middle Eastern geopolitical issues, but not so useful if you're trying to find out about the proliferation of ketamine in Brighton's seafront establishments. You'd look at BBC Sussex or the Argus for that kind of thing. Why are you asking for just one site again? You'll never find one that's relevant for everything you want to know.

I'm atheist. I might choose to wear a cross just because I like the look of it, though admittedly I never have. I did once wear a St. Christopher. It has no special meaning to me, but so what - that doesn't mean it can't look nice.

You can get jewellery with Mayan symbols on it, too. I wouldn't assume anyone wearing it is advocating Mayan religious beliefs.

And that's just it - just about any shape may have religious significance to someone. It doesn't mean anything unless you choose for it to mean something, and one way to make that choice is to start getting offended and banning things.

When people get offended by the Christian cross, that proves it means something to them, not to the person wearing it. And by getting offended, they try to push that interpretation on others. Which is pretty much what the Christians are accused of doing by wearing a cross in the first place.

true,dangercart,lfc68,,"There's a really simple answer to this:  Owners buy teams for one of a few reasons and the reason that FSG bought Liverpool precludes them from selling shares.  Some people buy clubs for fun or prestige (these people are very rich) and others buy it for cash flow (these people are dumb).  The Fenway group buys sports properties on speculation.

John Henry is a speculator and he believes that the total value of the sporting enterprise will increase at a faster rate than the other available outlets for his investment dollars.  He believes that there is the potential to increase his net worth by improving the on field and commercial performance of the club.  If he believes that, why would he sell shares now?  That would dilute his ownership stake at a time when he thinks the club is undervalued and make it more difficult to, in the future, cash out at a fixed price.

It sounds like I am saying that this is a bad thing but I don't think it is.  There should be no illusion that they are in this for the love of the club.

She LOVES her husband.  Loves him to death and is willing to die for him, no questions asked.

People have called said that her decision to 'give Rory up' was a selfish one.  And it was certainly uninformed and misguided, it wasn't selfish.  She LOVES her husband and gave him up because she truly believed that he would be happier with someone who could give him children.

I'm among those who like Rory more than Amy too, but I gotta give Amy her due.  She's not a bad person and she loves her husband.  We may  not like the form that love shows itself in, but that doesn't make her wrong and us right, it just means that we have a difference of opinion.

They definitely deserve it, and they'd be really good. 

Well hopefully, a lot of stuff like that doesn't transition transition well if given the wrong format. Like Pappy's have never found a tv format that shows just how excellent they are.

Or isnt that popular. I watched We Are Klang recently, and looking back at it is really funny, if really divisive, and deserved a lot better. I think it was completely mishandled by the BBC (on a related note I think BBC3 are absolutely the wrong channel to handle most new comedy because no one bloody watches it and they schedule it terribly etc) I fear Peacock and Gamble would have the same problem.

Although Peacock and Gamble have sort of taken over their mantle I hope there is more Klang in the future. Apparently they recorded a live dvd but it never seems to have been released, you'd think with Greg Davies's current success they'd jump at the chance to release it.

Alcohol is a drug that Jesus gave to his disciples himself. Indeed he mandated that his followers should drink wine to remember his sacrifice on the cross.

No sex before marriage, like most things, is not a requirement of being a Christian. Loving God, loving his creation (particularly the people) and following Christ is what's required.

At this point, frankly, if Rory gave up on her I'm not sure if I'd blame him.

There are plenty of ways her behavior can be explained psychologically, but any growth in her character requires her to *recognize* this and realize that, even if her childlessness was at the core of her kicking Rory out, that her actions really had nothing to do with him.  She was driving him away because of her own pain, not protecting him as she thinks she was doing.

Of course, knowing Moffat, she'll probably have that epiphany thirty seconds before deciding to let herself die to save Rory or something like that.

If he were completely immune to the effect, then he would have given her his bracelet the instant that they realized she'd lost hers.  Even if he weren't immune to a detrimental killing effect, he'd do that.  The *only* circumstance under which he'd protect himself at the expense of a companion would be if it risked turning him into an even greater monster or weapon - exactly what would be the case if he were subject to potential Dalek transformation.

We've seen him be completely willing to sacrifice himself many times to save companions, even in situations where regeneration might not be possible.  Those moments were important.  I'm not going to chuck out the theme of all of those past storylines for the sake of this conjecture.  This conjecture is based entirely on a few words from Rory.  But Rory knows nothing whatsoever about the Doctor's physiology, or how the nanoparticles work.  That's far too little to go on.

My theory is that it did affect them both, at a certain gradual rate; the Doctor just split the time between her and him.

I also really liked how you see Smith truly, *truly* afraid. We don't see this often, and the way it's done in this episode is just wonderful. 

Then there's Oswin Oswald. She's such a great character who I would have **loved** to see as a Companion. She reminds me of Rose, for some reason. Maybe it's her cleverness. Maybe it's her dialogue. Maybe it's her beauty. I just see so much of Rose in her. 

The ""Dalek Revelation"", as I like to call it, is absolutely heartbreaking. It's a classic Moffat twist, done in such a believable, sensible way (for a Dalek). 

Finally, I thought the ending was a bit...off. We have a perfectly done episode so far, and the ending was so weak IMO. 

It *completely* changed who the Doctor was to the Daleks. I don't know how Moffat is gonna write his way out of the Daleks not knowing who the Doctor is. It takes away so much of the tension from possible future encounters on the part of the Daleks. 

Don't even get me started on the chanting of ""Doctor Who"" at the end. That was just corny.

Though there's one thing I have to disagree with. Rory. Rory was actually being pretty mean here. Granted he was upset but man what he said...major ouch.

A friend of mine said it very well:

I think fangirls had such a reaction against Amy they immediately embraced Rory without actually considering what he was like. His sense of entitlement extends to the fact that he act as though Amy owes him a relationship. The whole 2000 year wait thing; everytime he brings it up it's the same as someone who forgives their partner for cheating, but then throws it back in their face every chance they get. He chose to wait - he can't keep throwing it back in her face as proof he loves her more (which is another horrible thing to say).

There's a constant criticism that Amy makes decisions for Rory about their relationship, but she doesn't - she makes decisions for herself about their relationship, but by it's nature they affect Rory. But Amy should be entitled to make those decisions. It's not healthy for someone to stay in an unhappy relationship because they think the other person didn't have a choice in the matter. Relationships don't work that way.

Rory demands a relationship from Amy, and indeed always has, but worse he obligates Amy into that relationship and takes full advantage of that. He always sees his sacrifices as greater than Amy's, but never stops to seriously consider them (His 2000 year wait is more important than the fact she was prepared to sacrifice her unborn child, her own and the Doctor's life because life without Rory wasn't worth living - I mean, seriously, which of those were the greater sacrifice?). He is just as, if not more selfish, then Amy, but he's far more insidious about it. At least Amy's selfishness is surface level.",0,1346815468,null,0,false,0,c63m4sv,t3_zdf95,t1_c63m4sv,t1_c63m27v,null,1429819904,18,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,18

true,FreelanceLefty,null,null,"Hi Major Chavez. Thanks for the kind words. 

True, I haven't provided solutions in this article, but that will be the subject of a future blog. Unlike the main parties, I don't put forward a single solution to overcome the worst recession in 70 years. This is a systemic crisis, which requires a systemic change.

Here's a rough outline of what I propose. 

- The nationalisation of all major industries with compensation to owners only on the basis of proven need. The fact that a small number of individuals ""own"" the factories, machines, tools and everything else humans need to provide for life's basics is the main reason for the obscene inequality and injustice that exists on this planet. 

- The nationalisation of all banks and financial firms. This speaks for itself. The people who run these institutions at the minute are glorified gangsters, so I would provide them with no compensation. These institutions would be merged into one state bank to provide savings accounts for individuals  and loans for worker-led firms. Which brings me onto my next point. 

- Democratise the economy. Capitalism is extremely anti-democratic. We may get the chance to vote for a handful of identical politicians every five years, but for the rest of the time we are dictated to by our bosses. All major investment decisions are taken by a tiny amount of unaccountable individuals. 

Capitalist politicians are keen to speak of democracy. Indeed, they often wage war and blow countries back to the stone age in the name of democracy, yet when it comes to the economy, they say we should leave the decisions to ""people who know best"". I believe all managers in all workplaces should be elected by their respective workers. Workers should have a say in how their work places are run and should receive back a fair share of the wealth they create. 

- Plan the economy. Under capitalism, there is no economic planning. Decisions are made according to profitability as opposed to social need. Thats why we have an oversupply of iPads and Spongebob Square Pants phone covers but a shortage of decent housing and food. It leads to economic anarchy and, occasionally, severe crisis. Under a socialism, the government and workers' representatives will plan the economy according to what society needs. 

- The nationalisation of all property. This will prevent another property bubble destabilising the economy in the future. It will also eliminate homelessness. Everyone will be provided with a house by the government, or which they will pay a nominal, low rent. Since everyone will have a home without the possibility of becoming homeless, ownership of more than one house will be prohibited. 

- End the obsession with unending economic ""growth"". Our planet, and its ability to support our species, is being royally fucked by capitalism. Our planet cannot sustain an economic system which requires unending growth. Life should be about more than the consumption of environmentally destructive material goods. We need to think beyond ""getting back to growth"" if we are serious about providing a decent standard of living for every human being on this planet. 

My solution transcends the borders of insignificant holes like Northern Ireland and also, of course, the existing economic system. A solution to humanity's ills can only be delivered on a global scale.

This is obviously a very rough and short description of what I envisage to be a sustainable and just planet. Forgive me, but I wrote it on my phone during work while looking after a bunch of rowdy children!

If rumours are to be believed, our two other target signings beyond Dempsey were Sturridge &amp; Walcott. I'd be very surprised if Walcott hasn't agreed a new deal with Arsenal by January, and the only way Sturridge will come here will be if he doesn't get enough game time in the first half of the season (unlikely, considering he's their 2nd-choice forward so he should definitely get rotated with Torres, especially once the Champions League fixtures kick in), or if Chelsea sign a striker in January - and in that case the timing of us getting Sturridge would be dictated by Chelsea's affairs rather than our own.

So the only other solution is for other targets to be identified in the upcoming months. Does anyone honestly know when the ex-City scouts' gardening leave ends? Because the lack of a plan B signing for the possibility that Dempsey fell through doesn't inspire confidence in the board's/MD's/whoever's planning of transfers as well as the current scouts' abilities to find suitable players for Rodgers' needs.

I'd agree with you, but look at the wages we paid Carroll. Hopefully FSG have learnt from their mistakes there, but I can't be sure.

You're right about us not signing an out-and-out striker, and about Suarez needing to play the pivot more successfully. But the problem is, I think playing that sort of striker would be a big adjustment for Suarez, and the best thing to do would be to bring in a new central striker who can and has played the pivot before, and move Suarez to the flank where he can play his natural game with devastating effect. He can still roam around despite being a wide player - see Ben Arfa at Newcastle.

But even though Suarez has yet to learn his role, I think Sterling's emergence and the lack of a left-sided attacking player has compromised Borini more than Suarez has; Borini has been shifted to the right because he's better in that 'unnatural role' (cutting in on the weaker foot) than Sterling would be, plus he's better defensively, allowing Johnson to get forward more than Enrique will on Sterling's flank (having said that, Borini was poor defensively against Arsenal).",0,1346829988,null,0,false,0,c63owfs,t3_zd8vo,t1_c63owfs,t1_c63om4s,null,1429821313,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Playing Haroun &amp; Zemamma in wide positions offered us no width all game from midfield.

Emnes came far too deep looking for the ball all game &amp; left us without any strikers in the box once Miller went off.
The one time he did get into the six yard box towards the end he missed a sitter which was easier to score than miss.

Steele played well again &amp; kept us in the game in parts, Hoyte &amp; Friend imparticular played very well, solid at the back &amp; good going forward causing problems.
Williams, Ledesma &amp; Smallwood all looked good once they came on &amp; Leadbetter has made that central Midfield position his own, apart from his banana shots he looked comfortable in midfield again .

Basically not good enough from a team meant to be challenging for promotion, too much tinkering for me.

He's called Kev, he looks slightly weathered, he's got remnants of a grey beard, cropped hair and is never seen without his Berghaus fleece.  He's had numerous jobs over his lifetime, ranging from docker to security guard but currently he is unemployed yet still reassures his peers that he is a ""grafter"" and he's contributed well over his share to society.  After picking up the paper in the morning he sits down in his house has a cuppa and a piece of toast and sets out either to the Job Centre or the local where he talks to people, he considers, less unfortunate than him.  Kev's wife, Mary, barely has influence in his life and they hardly acknowledge their existence to each other yet both insist they are ""childhood sweethearts"" despite not being able to recall a single romantic moment in the past decade.  Kev's hobbies include talking relentlessly about the shortcomings of the football team he supports, Everton, and even more so, his contempt for Liverpool.  Whenever meeting a fellow male who is indifferent to football, Kevin struggles to find decent conversation and often wonders how someone could not share his preference of sports and concludes that they must be gay.  After several hours when Kev has finished with football he moves onto local gossip, which women are most attractive in the immediate vicinity and Top Gear.  Kev also has several ""humourous"" videos on his Nokia E63, including ""annoying orange"" and ""dat 'amster o swears an da""  and to the delight of his peers plays it on full volume almost daily in the local.  

Does this sound like a character you'd be interested in?

- Kev in the Tesco
- Kev on Seel Street

true,ax4of9,null,null,"Walcott, unlike Sturridge or Allen, is relatively unfamiliar to Rodgers. The transfer fee can be excused, though we are definitely overflowing with homegrown players. The wages are incredibly ridiculous, however. I really doubt FSG will be willing to pay so much for so little. 

I don't think it'll be tough for Suarez to play the pivot. As I said, what I think Rodgers wants from Suarez is a 2-part deal. Half as a pivot, and half as a man-beater. He hasn't been acting the pivot side, so defenders just have to cover his dribbling line. Once he starts to bring Borini in more, and do more switching to the side, he'll do well. People are questioning why Borini isn't played more in the center since he is a poacher, but that is the exact reason why he isn't played there. A poacher in the center means that the attacks **have** to start from the flanks, or from the midfield. Suarez is supposed to switch with Borini, using the movement to pull defenders out of position, creating space for the right-back or the attacking midfielder to exploit. Borini doesn't hold the ball as well as Suarez, and definitely isn't anywhere comparable as a dribbler. Suarez has more options, he just needs to utilise them.

I think once Assaidi gets familiar with the team, we'll probably see him play on the right and Borini or Sterling on the left. There is one particular left-legged inside forward who can also play as the number 10 who I particularly like, though I doubt FSG will be willing to pay his €45 million release clause. If its a pivotal striker you want, then we'll have to cough up €60 million for his compatriot.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The University has a pretty intense fiber optic system set up, called the [Granta Backbone Network](http://www.ucs.cam.ac.uk/network/general/gbn). If you're living in college, you'll be on the [Cambridge University Data Network]
(http://www.ucs.cam.ac.uk/network) - essentially, you will have a very fast internet connection (probably of the order of 1 Gbps), and you'll get very fast speeds for things like CamDC which are contained within the CUDN.

There's a few standard University-wide regulations to do with data use and some standard 'don't do anything illegal' clauses, but for the most part that's regulated by your individual college. Maybe five or six years ago, some of the smaller colleges like Christ's still limited individual students to 1 GB/day and 5/week or similar. That's less prevalent now [*but apparently still true in some colleges - see below*].

My college didn't throttle your connection at all, and many students torrented large amounts. You'd get a warning if you were in the top 10 for download/upload, but nobody ever got anything other than a slap on the wrist. This may not be the same for your college, but there will be clear guidelines that they'll give you in freshers' week.

&gt;COMMENCE ANECDOTE:

&gt;Once I got an email from the head of IT about downloading the movie 'Precious' - he'd been contacted by the movie studio. I told him I hadn't downloaded it, which was true, and that was the last I heard of it.

&gt;(Actually, it turned out he'd had to send it out to a few people who had been running torrents at that time. I found out later that I knew the girl who actually had been downloading it, and she had never got in any trouble either - she admitted it, deleted the torrent, and that was the end of it. This was before I had even heard of the movie, and when it eventually came out I went to see it in the cinema - I guess they were cracking down hard because it was pre-release, maybe?)

In terms of pornography - again, so long as you don't draw attention to yourself or do anything illegal no college is going to stop you from looking up porn. Just don't have the sound on too loud, the walls are like paper in most staircases.

EDIT: [Here](http://www.ucs.cam.ac.uk/copyright)'s the University's official stance on downloading copyrighted materials. Actual enforcement of said stance is considerably more relaxed.

&gt;Completing his degree with a first? Possibly one of the hardest degrees as well as at such a prestigious college. They don't just give that stuff away. He has to have natural talent as well. Probably got some genes from his parents that make him smart.

Is it one of the hardest degrees? Do you have any evidence to support that claim? 

Regardless of how difficult it is; if those from more humble backgrounds don't get the same opportunities to pursue these qualifications, and these qualifications seem to be a necessity for getting a frontbench position, something is wrong.

&gt;At the same time, I don't want to see someone who runs a corner shop deciding what is best for this country. 

Since when was a degree a necessary qualification for being a representative anyway? Surely the makeup of our parliament should roughly resemble the makeup of it's constituents. 

I'd rather have someone who ran a corner shop in power, than someone who's only work experience is folding towels at Selfridges. At least the guy from the corner shop knows the price of a loaf of bread.

**From the Daily Fails own sodding article:**

&gt;At an inquest in Stockport, Greater Manchester coroner John Pollard said he could not understand why anyone would want to play the video game series which has sold **100 million copies around the world.**

&gt;Earlier this year Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik had claimed he had 'trained to kill' his 77 victims by playing the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare game. He said it helped him 'develop target acquisition' using 'holographic' technology.

&gt;Terrorist Mohammed Merah, 18, also played Call of Duty before causing terror across south west France in March when he shot dead three soldiers and four civilians, including a Rabbi and three children, at a Jewish school in Toulouse.

So the Daily Mail are inferring a connection between those who play these games, and people who go onto commit acts of terrorism?

Which assuming 100M copies have been sold, means 0.000002% of people who play this game have gone onto kill people. And that assumes that the game caused them to do it, which clearly isn't the case.

**0.000002%.**

According to statistics, 636 people were murdered in this country between 2010 - 2011. For a population of approximately 60M that means 0.00106% of the population were killed.

Now let's play a game of hysteria. Let's assume that each of those people were murdered by one person - so that's 636 killers.

Now let's infer that they all drank orange juice.

**That means people who drink orange juice are 530x more likely to kill someone than a person who plays Call of Duty.**

Regarding communist governments like the soviet union, economically yes they were considered very left-wing due to their opposition to free markets and regulating every part of the economy. However on an authoritarian/libertarian perspective, they were more right-wing - absolute adherence to the authorities and totalitarianism cannot be considered left-wing ideologies, regardless of their economic policies.  
  
As far as it goes, the [political compass](http://www.politicalcompass.org/) tends to be a better means of measuring people's beliefs. Rather than just calling people left or right, it's more accurate to place people on a scale between left, right, authoritarian and libertarian.

This wretched hive of moaning and negativity was starting to erode my own enjoyment of the show, so I departed in a skulk, and had a blast with the remaining episodes.

So far, I've found the reaction to the first episode to be mostly very positive in here, but as always there are a few who seem to go out of their way to find things to dislike about the show, yet continue watching week after week.

I'm gonna try to ignore them in favour of the positive things here, and add to that pile where possible.  To put it another way:

Yes, PPE is one of the hardest degrees to do.  People wouldn't come from all around the world, to a world renowned college, doing a world renowned course because it is easy.  If it was easy anyone, anywhere could do it.  I'm not saying it is the hardest but it is one of the most relevant in this particular case.

How do you put a measurement on level of difficulty with this?  Rocket science, microcellular biology, medicine etc etc I would consider to be within the same level of difficulty but I would not include the likes of media, equestrian studies etc as difficult, nor as relevant to someone who has ambitions to have a major influence in running parts of this country.  If someone has natural abilities these will be apparent (John Major) unless they choose not to utilize these natural skills.  Ok, it may be harder to get in to some of these places but still managing to complete them with a first is an incredible achievement.

I'm not saying that all have to have a degree.  John Major didn't have a degree.  He did have a high level of intelligence which is often associated with higher education.

Which is it then?

&gt;People wouldn't come from all around the world, to a world renowned college, doing a world renowned course because it is easy. 

Who says they go because it is 'hard'? It could just be they go because it gets you the sort of connections that lead to front bench positions. 

&gt;Ok, it may be harder to get in to some of these places 

It's *much* harder if you don't have the right connections/money.

Politics is tribal. I've seen it particularly with SNP and Labour in my various involvements.

&gt;I'm not saying it is the hardest
&gt;&gt;Which is it then?

It's the same thing just reworded.  I don't know how I have said it is anything different.  If you can define how you measure scales of difficulty (which I previously covered) and hardness then I will attempt to answer that further.

&gt;People wouldn't come from all around the world, to a world renowned college, doing a world renowned course because it is easy.
&gt;&gt;Who says they go because it is 'hard'? It could just be they go because it gets you the sort of connections that lead to front bench positions.

I didn't say that, you assumed it. You're twisting my words to suit your argument.  I'm not saying people go to it because it is easy.  I'm saying that it is prestigious in that you have to be extremly clever to do it (it is not easy).  This attracts the best minds in doing it.

&gt;Ok, it may be harder to get in to some of these places
&gt;&gt;It's much harder if you don't have the right connections/money.

And it is impossible if you don't have enough intelligence to do it.  You simply won't be accepted in to the course.  Yes it helps but it is not the only thing needed to get in.  You still have to be intelligent to do it.  You are basing your arguments on that he only got his education from who he knows not what he knows.

&gt;Higher education does not equate with knowledge. Knowledge comes from experience - and as far as I can tell, the guy running the economy has precious little of that (see my previous link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Osborne#Early_career[1] )

I'd also like to remind you, it's opt-out, always will be, and unless you're a parent or under 18, you will never experience anything other than the quick procedure of opting out. Parents need a tool available to them to enable their child to safely browse the Internet, and I'm not sure why people have a problem with this idea.

I'm quite a big fan of competitive play in general. I followed WC3TFT back in the day, with some slight interest in teh DotA1 scene. Moved over to RtCW:Enemy Territory, UT2k4 and SSF4/UMvC3 before making a return to the ARTS genre with Heroes of Newerth. For quite a while now, DotA2 has been my most played game, so naturally I started following the scene as a whole over at [GosuGamers](http://test.gosugamers.net/dota2).

Regarding a UK scene in DotA2, I have no idea if one *really* exists. By rights, it certainly should exist as I would have thought we have a fairly strong player base here. I'd love to see the UK scene grow, and even be a part of it. I'm not part of a clan, currently a social player, but I'd like to start getting competitive.

&gt;Yes you did. You said;

&gt;&gt;Yes, PPE is one of the hardest degrees to do. People wouldn't come from all around the world, to a world renowned college, doing a world renowned course because it is easy.

No, my statement was backing up the claim that people with the right apt and ability come to study it.  Not because it is hard, but because they are able to accomplish a prestigious degree.  

&gt;No, my argument is that access to this course isn't equal - yet an uncommon amount of our politicians are graudates of it.

So does that means he should not be in a position of power?  Even though he managed to pass with a first class honours from a red brick university?  I'm not questioning how he got in to university.  The fact that he did **and** did so well may have a relation to how successful his parents were.  I'm not surprised there is a direct correlation between successful people breeding other successful people.  You're acting as if it has all been handed to him on a plate.  He was given the opportunity which he took.  He still had to do all the work for his course including previous work necessary to get the required requisites to attend the university.

&gt;I thought we were talking about those with priviliged backgrounds in 'successful' positions? 
&gt;&gt;Your first post in this thread asked;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Are successful or wealthy people not allowed to come from a privileged background anymore?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You can't just dismiss the most obvious example because it doesn't fit your argument.

You're bringing up that George Osbourne did well even though he folded towels?  I have nothing against people with humble backgrounds being successful. In fact, I implore more people to do so.  That doesn't however mean that people with a better background should be discriminated because of their background.  It works both ways.

I think it's likely that the hijab is treated differently due to the cultural habits of Muslims. One aspect could be that a ban on head coverings is going to alienate Muslim women, or keep them at home all the time, and that ain't a good thing. On the crucifix side, I'm not sure it's the case that it was ever a *must* for Christians and it most certainly isn't now.

The rationale was that the children could not interact with her properly. There were various points against her: Though she claimed to be wearing the veil in case a male teacher entered the room, this hadn't stopped her from having her face uncovered at the interview.

But lo and behold, I am a vegetarian. I am unable to do my job because of a decision I've made about my own personal philosophy of not eating meat. This choice has made it so that I cannot fulfill the obligations of my job. Should I be fired?

I can't switch off my belief that eating meaty goodness is something a person should not do (because of the face and whatnot) but I am unable to perform the duties I agreed to when I took the position and SIGNED THE FUCKING CONTRACT!! And that's the point. A contract was signed by both parties (the employer and the employee) that obligations will be carried out by both parties.

Now don't get me wrong, I couldn't give a flying fuck what necklace you wear, but maybe someone working around metal detectors and aeroplanes shouldn't be wearing a loose piece of metal around their neck. No one has clarified exactly why they were banned (the article certainly doesn't state that BA banned religious necklaces, only that an exclusion was eventually made for religious necklaces, which could be interpreted that all necklaces were banned and this happened to affect people with religious necklaces), so it could easily be some form of health and safety ruling, rather than a direct attack on the religious. The article and others I've read make no reference to this. If you are able to show otherwise, please do.

And I certainly don't care if you disagree with the buttsecks, but denying the obligations of your job because of it, especially when you represent the government or are in a position where you are supposed to be counselling people who may indeed like the buttsecks means that you are in breach of your position.

[BBC timeline](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-19489545)

Of course all this in turn was in response to the marches by loyalists and republican protest groups during the summer... The loyalist band marching in a circle outside a chapel was in particularly poor taste.

The root cause of this is a lack of integration. Also young people in some areas look for any excuse for a good riot. I don't entrirely agree with the EDL anaolgy, the vast majority (I'd say 95%+) of marches are inoffensive and pass off peacefully. There are a few that are contentious however.

&gt;What do you mean ""breaking of the Web""? I don't think you know how it works yourself, so don't start telling me that I don't. 

Depending on how this firewall is implemented, it will effect the operation of the Internet and the Web in a spectrum of ways. Since this is just a pie-in-the-sky discussion, I will take liberties in making assumptions on how it will work. There will probably be a state-maintained blacklist of either domains, top-level domains (.xxx for example), URLs (www.reddit.com**/r/unitedkingdom**), IP-address or http session content.

If they block specific domains or TLDs, this will simply be avoided by pointing your computer to a new DNS server. Literally 30 seconds of work. If they block ip-addresses, they'd need to maintain a master-blacklist of prohibited IP addresses; this would be millions and millions of IP addresses and would continually need to updated, on a second-by-second basis to remain relevant and effective. With a master database in place, they could either route all the traffic, for the entire country, through one core router which would compare each requested IP address against this gigantic blacklist, or they could cascade the database to peripheral routers on a slave-master basis. With the first option, you've got a bottleneck so profoundly dangerous, it would certainly fail. This would never, ever happen. On the other hand you could cascade the job of processing the blacklist to the smaller peripheral routers around the country, but this would impose an extreme performance penalty as this database is going to be huge, not to mention exceptionally expensive to implement (I wonder who's going to pay for all the ISPs upgrades?).

Next up they could block specific URLs, but that would require a similar bottleneck as I mentioned above, as a proxy server would have to be implemented to process all the URL requests put through to remote servers. This is so far out of the realm of possibility, you might as well forget about it now. The same goes for running realtime analysis of webpage content. Not only can content analysis be defeated by using https sessions (something every website should employ anyway) but it is physically not possible. 

Imagine the processing power it takes a webserver to pull a page from storage and push it onto the network. Multiply that by the total number of requests made every second in the UK, and you'll understand that you'll probably need the double the entire processing power currently available to all webservers in the world, and then put that into a single datacentre. It's not going to happen.

As for ad-block, it's an opt-in plugin available for web-browsers that will scan incoming webpages for requests to pull ads from known ad servers. It works on the same principle (more or less) as domestic end-terminal parental controls. On an end-terminal you can do whatever you want; you can run DNS and IP blacklists, you can run real-time page content filters, and more. The difference between having this facility running on an end terminal rather than a core router or server is because a home computer will make a handful of requests for data from the Internet every minute; this is easily manageable. A core router will have to do that billions of times a second, without fail, constantly.

The reason people are objecting to this naval-gazing exercise by Madam Perry is because it's completely out of touch with what is technically and philosophically possible and desirable from the Internet. The Internet is designed to establish peer-to-peer sessions of information transfer between two hosts, with as much redundancy as is possible. The moment you start putting filters in place you're going to 'break' the philosophy of what the Internet is, and it will be a slippery slope. As they say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

We get a lot of hate which has lingered over from the 70s and 80s - many bitter football fans still recall the days when Liverpool tyrannically ruled the english league, declaring 'we're not english we are scouse'. Newspapers appeal to this bitterness. They also have narratives to support. When they invest a lot of their bullshit into these narratives (e.g. 'Benitez ranted at Fergie', 'Kenny Dalglish spent 100m on bad players') then they just have to keep it going.

The whole idea of legislating against discrimination is counter productive.  Even when you legislate against something it doesn't prevent it.  If you were to prevent them from discriminating against non-Christians do you suppose they'd still not hire the Christian in the interview process and just argue that they were the best trained candidate for the job citing non-empirical grounds, such as personality.  Of course they would, but by openly advertising that they're looking for a Christian they're potentially saving both their and the time of others.

Then comes the matter of what if a legislation prevents some form of discrimination by a service or a business.  The discrimination of the people wanting to import it doesn't go away, they just have reason to become more resentful.  Would a gay couple really want to stay at a B&amp;B if they knew the owner was an out and out homophobe - would they still want to give him their money?   Probably not, and it's probably going to reflect on their enjoyment of their stay anyway, even if the owner doesn't come out with his bigoted motives of why he's providing a lukewarm service.

Discrimination should be addressed culturally, and with as little legislation as possible.

They banned smoking outright in pubs.  Let the markets decide.  Let the default stand at no smoking in public places, and then allow establishments that want either smoking areas, or free-smoking to do so if they indicate that in their doorway or windows.  Green cigarette sticker/ blue cigarette sticker/no sticker.  If people in a group want either no smoking or restricted smoking they'll quickly learn which pubs do what.

Why not do the same with any other, more serious, form of discrimination? 

 If a B&amp;B wants to ban gay couples let it, but it must indicate that in any advertising, outside the establishment and at reception.  As a straight male if I see a 'Heterosexuals Only' sticker I'm still not going to use that establishment out of protest.  The owner won't be able to blame homosexuality for his business failing only his bigotry, and that will encourage him to appraise his own values.

We've come a long way since 'No blacks, no Irish' signs in windows.  Back then it wouldn't have hurt their business to do so, even helped it.  Now it would ruin it.  It's culture that has done that, not legislation.

While trying to find a source for that I notice he was done for not declaring £57,000 of payments from Unite to Parliament in January, don't remember hearing about that. I bet if a Tory did that with payments from big business there'd be pitchforks and lynching.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; Regarding a scripture teacher at a roman catholic school to discriminate in hiring they'd have to be able to justify that having the religion is required to teach it's scripture which they could not do.

the point is they are the employer. the 'genuine occupational requirement' is obviously open to interpretation; but who has a better claim to say what that is than the employer? the government clearly recognises such clauses/exemptions. 

&gt; No different to who you choose to vote for or where you choose to go to dinner, it really has little bearing on the job.

and yet political groups are able to discriminate based on political affiliation. (see above). why should religious groups be any different? 

&gt; They just want to discriminate against everyone but their own club because they think they're better people, which is the problem. It has nothing to do with qualification.

Of course not, it's discrimination based on a life-style choice which has _zero impact_ on how well you can do your job and the government treads very carefully on the matter.

I think the reason why he couldn't translate Judoon on the Moon, was because he was too far from the Tardis for the psychic link to work (Earth - Moon = very very far away, Earth - anywhere else on Earth, not that far away). Also, the translation relies on the combined linguistic knowledge of all travellers. Since the Doctor knows so many languages, his companions do too. But obviously, they're only Human. They can understand it as long as he Tardis and the Doctor are working properly, but they cannot learn it in this way. 
Possibly, for the Tardis to learn and thus translate a language, the Doctor, or another traveller must be within range of the Tardis while speaking to a native speaker of the language. If these are not simultaneous, then no translation. The Tardis only needs to be near a being to translate from it, but to translate TO, the being needs to have travelled within the Tardis.
This is all speculation, but I think it makes sense.
I would imagine he ""hears"" everything in Gallifreyan, as that's his native language. Or maybe, with the destruction of Gallifrey and the rest of the Time Lords, and the inordinate amount of time he spends in The UK, Earth, maybe English is now his native language and that's how he hears things.

true,tefster,uk,South-East,"I started with about 3m sq at home and then got an allotment. You can also grow in pots or boxes/buckets if you want to dip a toe in the water - I've done potatoes, spinach, herbs and other things in boxes and old milk crates at home. 

I do almost exclusively raised beds because I hate digging, I turned over small areas at a time and raised-bedded them using reclaimed wood (there's always someone in my area doing a loft conversion and so I'm never short of roof joists). Raised beds are more work initially, but I find them easier to maintain in the longer term as I'm not always fighting against encroaching grass and they make it easier to constrain crops and generally keep an area tidy. With a chop-saw, a power screwdriver and good screws I can make and treat one in about an hour and then an hour or so to fill it with compost. My local borough does free compost made out of our green waste so I use that and then top it up with free manure and a bit of topsoil.

My bed sizes vary between 2m and 5m long, normally depending on the lengths of wood I had at the time rather than any particular master design. I try and keep them to about 2.5m by 2m now, so around 5m square.

I focus on growing things that; I like (which sounds obvious but I know people who grow crops and then give them away because they don't like them!), that are more expensive to buy and/or are good yield, and that don't require loads of attention. Things like; courgettes, leeks, spinach, squash, beet, cucumbers, beans, parsnips, garlic, herbs, and berries. I found the [D.G. Hessayon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._G._Hessayon) veg books pretty useful for learning, after trying different crops and various failures I basically used that to come up with a list of what I liked and that was feasible to grow in the UK, removed things that were silly-cheap to buy (where I am potatoes and onions are so cheap that they aren't worth growing), removed ones which were high-maintenance or prone to failure (cabbage, cauli), and I plant what was left on the list.

As an example of what I grow and in what space, this year I did an experiment with over-planting to see how much I could get out of a small space. This was inspired by someone else on reddit who got a vast amount of veg out of 2 small beds that I think were each about 5m square, unfortunately I can't find the post now but I'll try and hunt around for it as it was a brilliant example of veg-growing at home. I did a bed sized around 1.75m by 3m (so not much smaller than your 6m square target) and planted some things vertically. In it I have; beetroot, onions, parsnips, leeks, butternut squash (vertical), cucumbers (vertical), tomatoes (vertical), sweetcorn (vertical), carrots, radishes, spinach, and I think there are some herb bunches in there. This was kind of overdoing it though, but by thinning out in the early months I've been eating meals from it since July and probably will through November.

What to start with depends on what you like to eat really, check out some of the easy-to-grow lists like [this one](http://www.gardenorganic.org.uk/growyourown/easiest.php). Courgettes are super-easy, but they do take up lots of space and like lots of watering. Spinach isn't everyone's thing but its easy, yelds well (if you get the perennial type then you can be eating it for half a year), can be used in salads as well as cooked, and its easy to cook down and stick in the freezer if you have too much. Tomatoes are normally good, but this year they've been dire and the last couple of years I've lost loads to blight. Runner beans always produce well, to the point where I get sick of them.

/r/gardening is good for tips as is /r/permaculture, and /r/frugal sometimes has useful stuff. You might find [this TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/pam_warhurst_how_we_can_eat_our_landscapes.html) interesting also, its by the founder of [Incredible Edible](http://www.incredible-edible-todmorden.co.uk/) and talks about the non-traditional places that they grow veg.

So if you're hiring for a Labour campaign assistant, it makes sense that you would seek people who share your values else they could be toxic to the campaign. What you could absolutely not ask is who you have and will vote for and discriminate necessarily on that.

I know the line you're going for here is ""If you can require people are interested in X, why can't you require them to be Y"". Well the reason is because you're discriminating based on something that is largely irrelevant. In the case of the scripture teacher, you needn't necessarily be religious to be a perfectly good teacher. In the example of the Christian Charity, you needn't necessarily be Christian to be charitable or capable of organizing charity.

Ultimately, your religion has no bearing on your capacity to do any job other than one the requires you preach that faith (So bishop, etc). So if this was a Christian Missionary organization - Knock yourself out only hiring Christians. You'd have to wonder how many non-Christians would take a job spreading the good word though, it seems like a fringe case the government would hopefully never have to rule on and would be the exact reason for the extraordinary exemption clause.

However I agree with Molby over Alonso, and I think the top three is spot on. It's one of the hardest questions when picking you're top liverpool XI - Dalglish or Keegan, Rush or Fowler, and Alonso and Molby? 

Maybe for pure technical skill, Alonso could win a passing competition on the training ground, but Molby had just that bit more to his game than Alonso. In his best season in the early part of his career, he used to start matches basically in the Beckenbauer role and then slowly creep up the field as the match wore on. He also had greater longevity than Alonso - alonso was at liverpool for 5 years, but the first couple were underwhelming and the first 3 were all hampered by injury. Molby was the feared player at liverpool for years from his first season. Even when he was no longer guaranteed a place ahead of barnes-whelan-mcmahon, he was still absurdly powerful from the bench.

I think it is far too early to be considering sponsorship of any sort, none of that will come without a stable community capable of producing quality players/teams.

So, on that note, what are the best tools to use to help build a community?  Reddit and Steam Community are a great start obviously, but should we be looking at some kind of dedicated site/forum where people can go?  The site could then incorporate in-house leagues/tournaments once the community grows a bit.

Were there no big original DotA teams from the UK?  Perhaps we can encourage people in the scene from the UK (2GD, others? CyborgMatt? I'm not very clued up to be honest...) to promote the idea and get people on board.

I did use an agent when I first moved in the with the missus -  we were pretty much forced to go to the TDS to get our deposit back. I hated the 'inspections', the rent increases, the ridiculous and useless inventory they paid no intention to anyway, the credit checks and intrusive contracts.

There are 20 teams in the Premier League plus many other big clubs in the lower leagues plus hundreds of teams around Europe.

If you are always looking for bias and persecution, you will find it.  That doesn't mean it actually exists, though.

Most journalists try to write honestly, just like referees are trying to call the game as well as they can.  They may not always be right or their logic may be flawed but few, if any, people are going to spend time going out of their way to maintain an agenda against any one club.  Why would they?

The bigger problem is that too many members of the media are not particularly well informed and don't really seem to care to change that.  It is easier to write inflammatory things, make snap judgements and rumor monger.

             I'm still not going to use that establishment out of protest."" 

&gt;The only reason you have this attitude, I believe, is that you've never really experienced it yourself. 

And how can I avoid those places if I never experience it?  I can go on using an establishment never knowing that the customer before me was turned away because of their sexuality, skin colour or religion.  If I had a way of knowing I could stop propping up his business.

Non-discrimination laws don't stop it from happening.  A gay couple walks into a hotel and they can be turned away, they just have to provide another reason other than their real motive. 

&gt;No taxi has ever driven past you because you're white. 

How would I know? White taxi drivers aren't the only ones that can discriminate.  I'm absolutely certain a taxi has driven past me because I'm male.  If I'm a taxi driver and I see an adult 6' male and a young, asian girl wearing 'I'm a lesbian' t-shirt a bit further down the street, I'd certainly stop for the woman rather than the man.  Discrimination?  Yes.  Dude's probably safer and it has nothing to do with her race or sexual orientation.  My taxi would stop for the girl first, unless they're in a queue.

&gt;No one's ever said you can't get married because your straight.

I'm all for gay marriage; in fact I'm all up for civil ceremonies and marriages being synonymous terms as far as the government is concerned.  If a church doesn't want to marry you then I believe that is up to the church - but I already said that there should be no government funding for any discriminatory business or body.  As far as I'm concerned if a church or a registry office is willing to marry you or form a civil partnership then that should be recognised by law as equal and the same as marriage in any other sense.

Problem?

&gt;No one's ever tried to legislate your body or it's workings because you're a man.

I'm the one arguing for less legislation.

Do you see?

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; The real problem is left/right is meaningless.

No, left and right are real things that have wide reaching implications. The difference between left and right is basically about property (not to be confused with possessions) - someone left wing thinks that property is inherently theft from someone else (i.e. conquering lands, exploitation of workers) and that hereditary wealth is inherently flawed. Someone right wing thinks that property ownership is what the world is all about, and that a right to be as wealthy as you can is the same as freedom (or rather, what makes humanity work), hereditary wealth is a natural product of this. Obviously, this is a spectrum. Authoritarians think that governments should exist to enforce these rules, liberals think that governments should allow individuals to be free - this is a different kettle of fish.

A key principle of fascism is the right of property ownership - to a fascist this is more important than any sense of democracy; in fact the strongest are probably seen as those with the most wealth. In the case of race based fascism, it is that those with a certain race are superior and so should be the ones in control of the property (Apartheid South Africa, Nazi Germany) .

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; Well the reason is because you're discriminating based on something that is largely irrelevant.

My point is that a political views are likewise irrelevant to the ability to answer a phone or perform basic admin duties for the Labour party. you could do all of that and be a BNP member. but we seem to agree its reasonable for them to want to employ people who agree with their political goals, and I don't see why that *should* be different for a religious charity or group. 

You needn't be political or agree with Labour to be a campaign assistant. you can just do the work; you don't have to agree with what's going on. 

&gt; Ultimately, your religion has no bearing on your capacity to do any job other than one the requires you preach that faith (So bishop, etc). So if this was a Christian Missionary organization - Knock yourself out only hiring Christians.

I think they kind of are. it's just that this job is not a preaching one; but the overall group is Christian. 

&gt; I don't think I articulated myself very well... But imagine how a Christian would feel if he was turned down from a job in science for having poor critical thinking skills? They'd scream discrimination from the roof tops.

well it would be fair if that candidate *did* have poor critical thinking skills. If the advert said ""no christians"" it would be discrimination; but I think we could understand why a job at the national secular society may say ""all applicants must be non-religious"" or ""must believe in the separation of church from state affairs and keep their faith to themselves"".

true,Curufir,null,null,"If you had porn channels enabled on your satellite connection would you allow your children to watch that television (the appliance) without supervision? No, of course not, because they might flick to the porn in error.

First problem I have with this proposal is that filtering software already exists. It isn't being used by parents and that makes it a parental training issue. Adopting a national filter because some parents refuse to learn basic computer skills before exposing their child to the internet is NOT a reason to impose a filter on everyone.

This cannot be applied per computer. For a shared connection, which most households have at this point, either they are signed up to porn or they aren't. Meaning that if there is an adult in the house, or a teenager of appropriate age, that wants to watch adult content where the household has not opted-in they are unable to do so. If there is a child in a household that has opted-in the child will need supervision and parental software controls in place just as they would at present.

Filtering isn't that good which creates a number of issues.  A quick look around Google image search with safe search turned on will show you just how poor content filtering is. This leads to parents having a false sense of security and doing even less monitoring of their child's internet usage than they are at present. Filtering certainly isn't good enough that it won't be easily sidestepped by a curious child. I'd imagine knowledge on how to bypass the filter will be passed around at school like anything else. There isn't a magic wand Claire Perry et al can wave to make their perfect censoring technology appear.

Censorship in a disputed area leads to over censorship of content Automatic censorship will lead to mistaken blocking for example things like breast feeding and sites containing words on the proscribed filtering list (e.g. Sussex). We haven't even got to the point of who gets to decide what is and isn't pornography? Is it someone showing an ankle or two guys balls deep in each other? A quick look around the film censor will show you examples of over censorship. Parents will have very different ideas on what is and isn't pornography and reaching a consensus will be impossible.

This is without even getting into things like filtering becoming a bottleneck on network speed or ISPs being sued because little Johnny saw a tit while the content filter was enabled.

However, my major, huge stumbling block with this is one of civil liberty.

Two massive problems I have with this:

If you want to filter everyone's usage then you will need to monitor everyone's usage. That is not a road we want the government going down.

The proposal is a barely concealed attempt to impose morality policing of the internet on the general population. The idea of a deviance register in order to view adult content is intended to shame adults into compliance as well as ""protecting the children"". A quick look at some of the lobbyists for the proposal will tell you why (if you can't be bothered to do so I'll let you in on the fact that they're Christians with a big C).

So there. In summation:
It can't be done effectively.
Bad parents are bad parents.
I am not responsible for your children.

true,ComputerJerk,hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt; I think they kind of are. it's just that this job is not a preaching one; but the overall group is Christian. 

Then the problem is that of intolerance. You needn't be a Christian to share the goals of their charity just like I don't have to be a Socialist to share the goals of the NHS. Suggesting you could not operate in a Christian environment without being one is either insinuating that you are intolerant of them or they are intolerant of you. Again, this is just discrimination based on the per-conceived idea that you are incompatible with their work force because of different views.

Tying that into your first quote, personally believe that any job that requires you hold an opinion to be compatible to be entirely unworthy of my attention. For the sake of company cohesion however, the difference is if you are a hard-line conservative it is not unreasonable to believe you would not be the best worker in a Labour campaign.

Effectively working for the labour government in this case is like the fringe case I outlined for being religious to work for the church. You should not be exempt but it benefits neither party to really enter an employment contract. You don't care for what they do and they don't want an employee less likely to work hard.

The secular society is potentially exempt under the descriptions I've suggested above, they're a special-interest/pseudo-political group.

Returning to the original example I drew - Would you suggest that all religious people being exempt from jobs in science would be reasonable? They have openly demonstrated their inability to possess critical thinking in their lifestyle choices, so should they just be condemned without opportunity to explain why they would be a good fit for the job?

You can't make huge sweeping assumptions without good evidence that someone would be a bad fit. However, being a god-fearing member of the catholic church is a pretty good reason to suggest you would not fit in the secular society, being a hard-line atheist would be a good reason not to hire you to be a Pope.

But suggesting you couldn't man the phones of a charity that provides a service to the needy because your don't share a religion is just absurd. You can't conclude that and you could not convince a jury it would be necessary.

And ultimately that's why it's against the law barring exceptional cases such as those I've described. IANAL though but it would seem to be the intention of the legislation.",0,1346858662,null,0,1346859462,0,c63t22e,t3_ze1qf,t1_c63t22e,t1_c63ss3p,null,1429823235,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

As it is, they would have laws to defend them from public or government offices doing it against them - and they're cheaper to monitor and regulate anyway.  But let's look at the examples he/she set up:

          ""No taxi has ever driven past you because you're white.""

How do you legislate against that?  The taxi driver simply has to say they were focussing on the road and didn't see the pick-up.

More over there are taxi companies that have female only drivers that specifically target female trade.  I have no problem with that either.  I just won't order a 'female specific' service, just as I wouldn't order a 'whites only' service - even though I qualify there.  The whites only service will die an economic death, the female service will probably go on to do quite well.  People recognise positive discrimination and can evaluate its merits.

          ""No one's ever said you can't get married because your straight.""

Legislation is going to have a difficult time making a Catholic church provide gay marriages.  That's pitting religious freedom against gender equality.  I advocate the government recognising civil partnerships as marriage though.

               ""No one's ever tried to legislate your body or it's 
                workings because you're a man.""

I can only presume this relates to abortion - which is allowed in the UK - and as I said I'm arguing for less legislation for all.  As it is people have tried to legislate against the workings of a body in the male gender.  Chemical castration, male circumcision.  Please don't read into that any defense of pedophilia - it's not.

This isn't the same as 'Catholics need not apply' shipyards. Having values which are compatible with Catholicism is a pretty big part of delivering a Catholic education.  Teachers don't just give lectures, they discipline the class, they provide role models and they have pastoral roles. Like I've already said being an non-Catholic does not exclude you and being a baptised Catholic doesn't guarantee you'll be hired. 

Furthermore, race and ethnicity are certainly aren't relevant to who you are as a person, but religious values certainly do. They are irrelevant to your ability to do a lot of things, but they are quite central to how suitable you are for roles with explicitly religious elements: delivering a catholic education etc.

true,ComputerJerk,hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt; Why would this be different from a Gaelic medium school discriminating against a prospective maths teacher for not speaking Gaelic?

First of all, linguistic skills are just that - Skills. So if you lack them, tough luck and come back when you've learned it. An employer is welcome to create a job advert based on whatever skills they like, regardless of relevancy and is covered briefly by a separate discussion in this same thread.

To address the rest of your post, discrimination is a loaded word and I think though your usage is correct it's portraying the wrong image. You're right that giving like-minded individuals preferential treatment is a form of discrimination but it is also *demonstrably beneficial* to the role at hand. As I've suggested, in those cases where lacking a trait or belief would be harmful to your ability to perform the job then that's where the exception clause comes in.

Proving that deficiency is, however, the employers responsibility if confronted.

Regarding religion in schools... I do not really want to get into the debate on the internet. I will briefly say that schools are a place to open your mind - Not be pressured into closing it. Refusing to hire teachers that might open the eyes and ears of their students is just negligent in their responsibility to educate. The idea that a school is a place where a child should go to receive a sound catholic upbringing is entirely offensive to me. Take it to church or go home. Education should be secular, superstitions have no place in the classroom.

&gt; Furthermore, race and ethnicity are certainly aren't relevant to who you are as a person, but religious values certainly do.

So it is safe to say I could start a scientific organisation and discount all catholics on the grounds that they fail to demonstrate sound critical thinking skills? If someone's religion is so very definitely part of who they are - Is it not safe to say that they carry the faults of their superstition with it? Or is the proposition one sided and that being a religious person can only benefit their character?",0,1346860284,null,0,false,0,c63th3b,t3_ze1qf,t1_c63th3b,t1_c63t5vx,null,1429823432,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

They are living organisms with their own brain (See Dalek Caan).
It's weird to see that their memory just got erased because a human turned into a Dalek and wiped some sort of harddrive. I'd understand if the Daleks similar to Oswin (All the ones that were changed by the nanobots) had their memory wiped.

But they weren't similar. The Daleks on the ship in orbit were living Dalek organisms, they aren't robots, they are small creatures in a robotsuit with a mind of their own. How does one wipe their entire memory?

A hivemind? I find that stupid, that would mean every Dalek knows what the other Dalek is thinking. They don't (See Daleks in Manhattan). 

Lastly I'd like to adress the Doctor himself saying ""Doctor Who"". It's definitely weird, but at the start of the episode he said to make an impression. He had the perfect opportunity to make an impression as well as keeping himself disguised and mysterious.

Another element of this which baffles me is that Malouda is capable of playing in CM and we've just farmed out Essien and Benayoun, sold Meireles. How much cover do we have for that position now? What if we get a rake of injuries later in the season and are forced to turn to Malouda? He'll have been training with a bunch of kids and won't be up to speed with the rest of the first time. It's a bunch of bullshit, really.

What I think happened is that CFC tried to force Malouda's transfer from the club by saying he'd be training with the U-21's if he didn't leave, Malouda turned down any offers because of the reduced salary (as he is perfectly entitled to) and now CFC have to stick to their guns and send him to the youth team when it actually doesn't do either party any good in the long run.

Training with the U-21's won't make Malouda a more interesting transfer prospect to anyone and neither will it make him a more viable selection option for the first team.

He was obviously hurt and looking for a reason and settled on ""she just can't have loved me very much.""  This was the first time they really had that discussion, that she can't have kids, that he's always wanted kids, that she has strong feelings about the situation and feels she's being unfair to him.

A makeup under those circumstances isn't unheard of.  When she finally came clean about what was going on, I think Rory was able to see her in a new light.  I'm sure we'll still have issues that crop up between the two of them, but they're on the path to fixing this.

Edit:  Can't believe I didn't remember this earlier, but when the Doctor dropped Amy and Rory off at their new house, he said something to alluded to the fact that he wanted to give them up before they got hurt or broken in some way.  The fact that Amy is suddenly unable to have children, and that was done to her at Demons Run...  The Doctor failed.  And that injury or whatever they did to her has also come to hurt Rory as well.  It's thrown everything for them out of whack.

I wouldn't ever defend Amy for not having this discussion with her husband, but I can see why she didn't.  She was probably very upset herself; having only one child and knowing she'd never get to raise that child, I can see why she probably wanted more children, so she would get that experience of being there for the child.

You should also look into how Slovakian qualifications translate into A-levels or a baccalaureate (I don't know what you study in Slovakia). I believe that you will need some mathematical ability to study CS, so you should probably work on that too. For some universities, this may in fact be vital. In terms of competitiveness there are lots of different ways to look at it but as a very very rough guide:

Most competitive: Oxford, Cambridge (need AAA minimum, in A-levels)
2nd Most competitive: LSE, Imperial, UCL (probably AAB min)
3rd most competiive: Other Russell Group unis: Manchester, Bristol, Kings College London etc (probably AAB-BBB)
4th Most competitive: Other unis: Surrey, Chester, Bolton etc (BBB-CCD I would guess)

Finally, you could apply for a 1 year diploma/ access route. Entry requirements would be lower and this might help you.

This is the thing.  You're not an expert.  This was also my understanding of the law - but I'm not either, and after a bit of thought I think there are some problems with what you are saying.

I think there must be *some* exceptions in certain situations - for example, churches will be able to refuse muslims from pastor positions at churches.  If they can't - then the system is *really* messed up - I hope you agree it is likely that there are *some* exemptions for religiously motivated movements.

Because there most likely are *some* exceptions, and subtleties of the law are beyond what we know.  This should make us cautious before giving an answer like yours.

I suspect this is not illegal.  My dad is chairman at a medium-sized religious charity.  I know they do have to make their mission statement equal opportunities, with a recentish law, which posed a particular irrelevant problem for that charity.  The reason I mentioned this is because they got a huge amount of legal advice from a professor in charity law (yes they exist!).  As a large charity, I would be very surprised if World Vision did not get significant legal advice on these sort of issues.

These sort of things are not the sort of things charities tend to blast through and assume will be ok - this I know.

However, now that Hulk was actually transferred due to Zenit's wealth and the Russian Premier League's transfer window closing later than most others, it is likely that Porto will be much less willing to sell. If they are willing, it is also likely that they will demand a greater fee than was originally agreed.

I think the transfer of Moutinho to THFC will hinge on the performance of both Porto and Spurs into January. If Porto are performing well and it is not soley because of Moutinho, they may sell. If Spurs are performing below par, only then do I see us making a move for him. If we are playing even adequately, I just can't see Daniel Levy offer a club record transfer fee for a player he may not deem as absolutely vital.

I really started to dislike the Daleks as a villain in past episodes just due to how often they were brought back and how they dropped from being the most feared warriors in all the cosmos to comic relief.

Amy and Rory divorce, I'd say it's a plot point to show their relationship in another light. 
How do the Daleks identify the Doctor? I'd guess scanning him and seeing he's Galifreyan. And as there's only one Galifreyan left to their knowledge, it would be the Doctor.

true,moomtoom,null,null,"I believe the 2010 Equality Act brought all previous anti-discrimination legislation together. In doing so it now covers 9 protected characteristics which cannot be used to 'treat people unfairly'. These are:

* age 
* disability
* gender reassignment 
* marriage and civil partnership 
* pregnancy and maternity 
* race (including ethnic or national origins, colour 
and nationality) 
* religion or belief (including lack of belief) 
* sex 
* sexual orientation 

In the UK, positive *discrimination* is illegal, however positive *action* is allowed in certain circumstances.

""Positive action applies to all these protected 
characteristics. Positive action provisions mean 
that it is not unlawful discrimination to take special 
measures aimed at alleviating disadvantage or 
under-representation experienced by those with 
any of these characteristics."" [- taken from a home office pdf on positive action, pg3](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/equalities/equality-act-publications/equality-act-guidance/positive-action-recruitment?view=Binary)

However, ""the new positive action provisions make it clear 
that employers must not adopt policies or practices 
designed to **routinely** favour candidates with a 
certain protected characteristic, even where there 
is evidence of under-representation or disadvantage. 
All suitably qualiied candidates must be considered 
on their individual merits for the post in question. 
Where one candidate is clearly superior or 
better qualiied for the job than the others, then 
an employer should offer the position to that 
candidate"". - [taken from same pdf, pg9](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/equalities/equality-act-publications/equality-act-guidance/positive-action-recruitment?view=Binary)

So, I'd say that it doesn't appear to be legal as it appears to routinely discriminate.

That is one of the worlds most famous street artist.
http://i.imgur.com/sTdzi.jpg 

That is a stencil, so anyone can do it.
http://cdn2.irishviews.com/irishviews-cdn/graffiti.jpg 

That is maybe someone just under a year doing street art.
http://www.graffitistreet.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Graffiti-art-font.jpg 

That is a terrible colour pallet and terrible lettering. 

So what you have used as examples are: 

1) one of the most popular and famous street artist in the world, a stencil that a 7 year old can do. 
 
2) lettering by people who have terrible colour sense and no can control.

 If those people do what they do(ON LEGAL WALLS) and practice, yes they will become better.


Now I'm not going to hijack this any more, but what you are comparing things to is a 2 year old finger painting against da vinci. I know a lot of street artist, who have a lot of exhibitions, and make a living out of it. Some people understand it , other people don't, that's fair enough There is not 1 thing in the world that everyone loves. But what is annoying are little stuck up pricks who think they know the industry or spit on it because they don't understand it. And what you just proved is you do not understand it, by linking that shite!

All I simply said was more Legal graffiti walls are needed to encourage people to practice, learn and get better. And simply said tagging on these walls are a need for can control.

Its like saying why someone who picks up a paint brush cant pain the mono lisa. Do you expect them to know all techniques straight away, same is with graffiti. Do people know the difference between a fat cap or a string, a sparkle or a pop? 

When people start something, they cant instantly be good at it, they need to practice.

I do not agree with tagging on public or private walls, on street windows or trains. Like I said in my original post. LEGAL WALLS are needed all around the world.

true,stop___grammar_time,tardis,TARDIS,"I think Moffat would probably be up for something like that, seeing as Jack's one of his characters and he's head of Doctor Who now. However, the fact remains that Torchwood is RTD's show, and he's stated in the past that he doesn't want the Doctor to appear on Torchwood. His reasoning is that Torchwood is an explicitly adult show aimed at an adult audience, and having the Doctor on would encourage younger children (part of Doctor Who's target audience) to watch, and he felt that would be inappropriate.

I don't think that the other way around would work either. Torchwood now is pretty much Jack and Gwen. Jack would work because he's Jack, but in a sanitized Doctor Who setting without all the Torchwood drama backing her up, Gwen's kind of a boring character.  I suppose you could lump in Rhys and Rex - Rhys is in the same boat as Gwen, kind of a flat character without the Torchwood stuff, and Rex is kind of a boring character regardless.

The severity of finales, in order:  
1) Daleks take over Earth  
2) Daleks and Cybermen take over Earth, plus Alternate Universe  
3) Master enslaves and tortures all of humanity brutally in preparation to destroy rest of Universe  
4) Davros destroys the entire Universe  
4.5) Master enslaves all of humanity, brings back Time Lords, destroys all of spacetime  
5) Tardis explodes and takes all of spacetime with it  
6) River tries to alter a fixed point; destroys all of spacetime  

So, the main problem is trying to keep things interesting by escalating each finale to have higher stakes. It gets bloated. It's my personal opinion that the Pandorica finale is possibly the best, especially in juxtaposition to the mess that the previous two finales were. The Davros finale was an absolute mess of too many things and too many conflicting emotions. In the end it seemed hollow for all the high-speed crap that just kept happening. The Pandorica tied together the entire fifth series into one ending, woven together with threads from the previous episodes so that it was made stronger by them, and not fractured as the RTD ones were. All the Universe-exploding wasn't as important as the scene with the Doctor telling little Amelia a story at her bedside. That was the true climax of the series, and it's small scale is what sits most with me.

true,erythro,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"Is that a fact?  I mean, the ""better qualified"" that the guy would be would be is because the job description was inherently discriminatory.

If this was an unregulated thing, then it would be bad, e.g.: ""I only want white men applying for this office job"" or ""No homosexuals should apply for this job as a bouncer, we don't want your type - you aren't hard enough"".  However, if it was banned altogether it would be bad too: ""You can't specify a white person to play the role of harry potter!  That's racist!"" or ""a disabled person can make a perfectly valid yoga demonstrator!  Stop specifying physical fitness and flexibility as a qualification in your job description, it's wrong"".

Does the law tread an appropriate middle line, protecting the reasonable discrimination and preventing the objectionable?  Or does it sit on one of these extremes?

I would be surprised if it sat at the extremes, as I don't hear similar ridiculous situations to the ones that I came up with.  Have you ever seen a visibly inappropriate actor cast for a known role for legal anti-discrimination reasons?  Have you seen disabled people working jobs that they are clearly unable to physically perform properly based on non-discrimination law?

TL;DR What you say seems to be implying is that the government takes an extreme position regarding discrimination law - I am asking for you to demonstrate whether this is factual or not.

true,erythro,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;My point was merely that on most occasions the Christian would be better suited to the role of priest than a Muslim man. I wasn't necessarily implying that they HAVE to do that. It was just that it wouldn't be seen as discrimination.

For it not to be discrimination, they'd have to show that there was no barrier to him getting that job because of his religious views.  Otherwise, it is discrimination.  I don't think discrimination is an inherently bad thing, just that in most cases it really is.

I think you might be conflating ""discrimination"" with ""unreasonable discrimination"".  There is such a thing as reasonable discrimination, and it can be good thing.

However whilst I accept that they claim it has no religious significance now, (and changed their motto in the 60's I think to something that had less religious connotations) its initial founding was Christian in some respects. A quick google suggests the symbol is a European one from a Geneva convention, and a leading figure was Jean-Henri Dunant, who was a devout Calvinist and devoted large parts of his life to social work in prisons and stuff. The red cross and crescent movement came out of his desire for there to be a national body for caring for war wounded (in Switzerland) and the organisation just spread.

That seems pretty pointless considering people come here to discuss and better understand the episode they just watched. 

I think a week is unreasonable. I think the current rules are fine, even if not well enforced. I come here after an episode to see what other fans think about what just happened. I don't really come here to see everybody's new tardis cake toppers. I don't think the majority does either. 

I think some self control on your part would solve your problem. If you haven't seen the episode, stay off the board if you don't want stuff spoiled. It is a lot easier to control your own actions than those of thousands of other people. And it's more logical.

You'd bring a case based on the letter of the law (to an employment tribunal most likely); I don't know the law properly but from my understanding, the employer would have to demonstrate an operational requirement that someone who was a Christian is the *only* person who could fulfil that job. Since this is a marketing manager position, someone quite possibly could challenge it and win - there are plenty of PR managers for oil companies that drive Priuses and plant trees, and it wouldn't be any different for a charity which is Christian-affiliated: as an atheist I could probably knock up a perfectly good press release for them.

true,ChemicallyBlind,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"i just finished watching this episode and it was very good, ive not watched any dr who since matt smith started because i never liked the story ideas they came up with, but i thought id try this episode. While it is good a few things annoyed me. for a start all of the episodes in which the intensive care daleks featured in i have seen and so i was rather annoyed to see them in the 'new' style armour. personally i think it would have been great to see them in their old respective armour styles. 

second this is the first time (that i am aware of) that the daleks have ever reffered to the dr. as a 'predator' so its irritating whenever it comes up like its been known from the very begining.

 another problem is the nano cloud, its a cool idea but i have to ask if the daleks hate all other lifeforms why would they occupy the bodies of our comparitively weak humanoid frames? in addition, why dead ones? they are slow and clumbsy and so it makes no sense. 

And last but not least, the whole thing about the daleks not destroying other daleks out of pure respect for each others hate is grade a bs, how many episodes have i seen where daleks happily destroy one another? there are quite a few. it seems really arbritary to me. 

despite all that, its a good ep, the writing is good, the characters are enjoyable, i like the psychological aspect to the daleks mainia (although they could have explored that alot more by giving them a wide array of psychological illnesses instead of giving them all dalek dementia), skaro was nice to see again, overall its a good ep but im still left worried about future eps.

In the heat of the moment you are allowed to use any reasonable means to defend yourself, and if that means shooting them with a shotgun, then so be it.

Regarding warning shots, you will find no firearms training information anywhere that states that it is a good idea to do that, and with it likely being only a double barreled shotgun it's probably not a good idea to waste one of your two shots on trying to scare an armed intruder off.

Each actor has brought something wonderfully different to their portrayals, but lets face it, the writers and fantastic writing is what keeps this show going.

He grew up on the show and now gets to do what every fanboy wishes he could, make his favorite show HIS show. I love the themes he runs with because honestly, as a fan myself, it's what I think about too. What would it have been like if a crazy man came down and swept me away to play with time and space? Would it all have been a dream when it was over? I connect to Moffat, I also think elegant is a nice word to describe his writing. Well, that and quirky with a tad bit of snark. And reverent. I think his adoration shines through for these characters and the world that has been built up over nearly 50 years. I trust him to take care of it for me.

I understand the front page problem. Personally, I still think 48 hours is enough time, even with today's DVR society. I would definitely not complain if you garnered enough support and convinced the mods to make the change. If that's what everybody wants, then so be it.

I just disagree. I think 48 hours is being considerate. I think enforcing a week, without overwhelmingly popular support, is being inconsiderate of the other 85,000 subscribers wishes. Obviously if spoiler posts are hitting the front page after day 3 then the subscribers are voting them up and want to see them.

As to your comment about letting everyone enjoy the subreddit. I also have to disagree. I do not see a whole lot of new posts complaining about the rules and spoilers.....so most people are enjoying the subreddit. You are asking for changes to let YOU enjoy the subreddit more. And that's fine. You are more than entitled to rally your cause. I'm just not in your corner on this proposal.

Do I think there could be more attention to the current policy by the Mods? Of course. I see many posts slip through under the current rules. Does it bother me? No. I have and will continue to enjoy the subreddit, no matter what you guys decide. Like I said; good luck.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"&gt; I would understand if it was for the role of a priest or vicar

Legally, this could be awkward even then. A number of priests have turned out not to believe in God. [This rather old story](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/393479.stm) suggests there's 50 ""Godless vicars"" just in one organisation in the Anglican church. There is (or was) also at least one [non-believer Catholic priest](http://www.sofn.org.uk/press/bullock.html) according to that same ""Sea of Faith"" organisation.

So far as I can tell, lack of religious belief didn't stop these priests/vicars doing their jobs as effectively as anyone else until people found out and started (arguably) discriminating.

At least superficially, it's pretty damn strange that a non-believer would even want to be a priest, and it raises questions about honesty (e.g. vows), but then again peoples beliefs can change over time I guess, so they could have believed when they took their vows.

Anyway, if no-one can even tell they don't believe until they say so, it seems things operate perfectly well even when the priests don't believe, so belief seems not to be a genuine operating requirement. An atheist can do the job - a number seem to be doing it already.

Directors working with him had a hard time, because Tom Baker ruled the show. The Doctor was Tom Baker, and if the Doctor didn't like dialogue or a scene, he'd be difficult. He had (and still has) a larger than life persona unlike the Doctors that came immediately before or after.

This also with the fact landlords get peace of mind by using a agent means more and more will use agents so if you want to rent you need to start using agents .Also gives peace of mind for a tenant.

true,indigomm,uk,London,"I head up the technical department in our company, so have quite a bit of experience of how it works. My advice on getting a job:

1. The London market has lots of people looking for jobs through agents. Most aren't very good (both the candidates and the agents). However there are lots of positions to fill and not a lot of good candidates. IF you are good then you have a good chance of getting a job.

2. I pay more attention to CVs sent directly to us. If you've taken the time to find us and email us directly then you are probably more motivated than average. A direct contact will also save me the 15%-25% of year 1 salary I would have to pay a recruiter. Obviously we want the best people so cost isn't always an issue, but if I'm short on time I'm more likely to read those CVs than ones from some recruiter.

3. You will need to write a covering email. Reality is that if you are making lots of applications, you will send the same email to everyone. However, if you take the time to customise it a little bit for each company then that makes me think you are actually interested in working for *us*. Perhaps reference some work we've done that relates to one of your interests, and explain what similar work you've done.

4. Larger companies will tend to use recruitment agents - so you may have less success contacting them directly. Worth a go though.

5. Make sure you have a decent CV and SPELL CHECK IT! I get so many that have spelling errors, which is inexcusable given everything has a spell checker built in. I'm trying to get an overall impression and this tells me that you don't pay attention to detail. Developers need to communicate and that includes writing effectively.

6. I'm interested in the work *you* did and what *you* contributed. So please tell me about the sort of work you have done, and how it helped the business.

7. If you have something like a StackOverflow account, blog or other website please tell me about it. It's worth so much more than a CV. Just having a StackOverflow account will almost automatically get you an interview with us.

8. Don't worry if you don't hear back. Sorry but I get hundreds of CVs a month and believe it or not I have other work to do.

I'll admit I don't like recruiters. They take advantage of a market where there is demand for good candidates, but few around. They are very devious - they will often outright lie to try and get through to me. They will say they are a friend of mine, a client, that I called them - whatever it takes just to get a foot in the door.

Whereas Rory finally has the guts to stick up for Amy by waiting for her for 2000 years- he does something magnificent for her. But then he ruins it by using it as emotional guilt to pressure her into a relationship.

Rory seems to think that if he shows Amy enough loyalty she is *obligated* to be with him. And she's not. Nobody is obligated to stay in a relationship no matter how nice your partner is.

Amy may be selfish but she never tried to coerce Rory into anything.

true,Cold_Kneeling,null,null,"Tl;dr: oh god, erm, basically - I was sad and Doctor Who was a coping mechanism; I admire the Doctor's morality and the show's messages about equality and compassion and my god I love the escapism :) Also it's a really well made program and it's good that they tend to employ unknown but brilliant actors and help them up the career ladder. Sorry, what follows is really not brief. Read it if you want to fall asleep from boredom possibly.

Well... Doctor Who means a lot to me on several levels. First of all, and probably most importantly, is the escapism combined with a very stressful real life. The modern series of Doctor Who coincided perfectly with the start of severe and pervasive family issues for me and David Tennant's era  started on cue with my resultant depression. As things got worse in those years and I buried myself deeper and deeper in the story, it became the only means by which I felt I could feel emotions other than lethargic despair (sorry for the depressingness :/ :P) When the Doctor was happy, exuberant, exhilarated, I could feel an echo of that even if a smile was a bit of a facade ad an effort to achieve in normal life. By the lowest point of those years I'd realised my over-involvement in the Doctor's world - all that freedom and happiness and true love and adventure and best friendship and everything that was missing in the real world that I was experiencing - but decided that I'd actually rather live in a delusional one-foot-in-fiction worldview than just the real, horrible one. I've got better since then, but I don't see that side of my past obsession with Doctor Who as a bad thing - it may have been self-denial, almost delusional, but it was a coping mechanism, and to this day Doctor Who occupies a special place in my heart for being my shelter from the worst time of my life. I can recall a number of times when I considered death, still not sure how seriously, and I convinced myself to stop thinking that way because, well if I was dead wouldn't I be disappointed to miss the next episode of Doctor Who? :P I know that doesn't make sense, but Doctor Who gave me a spark of happiness and escapism to live for when there wasn't a great deal else I could see. Also related was the Doctor's kindness to outcast or shy/nervous/damaged individuals (particularly the tenth and - my favourite - the second) perfectly aware though I was of his fictionality, I felt slightly safer feeling like if I met him, he would want to help me.
Other sides of my whovianism are happier :P though doubtlessly linked (e.g. if it wasn't such a beautiful story I wouldn't have buried myself in it, if I didn't see it as something I owe - in part - my life to, I probably wouldn't put it on such a pedestal, but anyway...). I think it reminds me of all those truly heart-capturing, beautiful stories about adventure and freedom that were my favourite growing up - things like Narnia and The Princess Bride - I can't describe why that's so important to me very well without making you bored of superlatives and the word 'escapism', I suppose it's just the type of story I love on one level, and secondly - let's face it, the real world is a bit boring and frankly I genuinely believed I was a fairy until an embarrassingly old age (8 or 9 maybe) and it was a bit of a disappointment to find out I was heading for the same stressful, mundane life as most western humans expect. Doctor Who (and Narnia, and Harry Potter, and Spirited Away and all the best stories in my opinion :P Even the Princess Bride through Goldman's made-up depressing life and the points of hope he pretends the story provided) recognises that yes, normal life is boring BUT here is a story, a man, space-ship that can take you away from it into world of discovery and emotion and beautiful variety.
Variety leads me on to my next point :) (sorry - I considered using the username 'cannot be concise' but meh :/ :P) I'm so... proud of Doctor Who's take on equality and variety - right from Patrick Troughton's time, if you meet a scary alien, they're innocent until proven guilty - offer them a jelly baby and only take offence IF they try to kill you, not before. In other words, treat everything sapient as people, not monsters; and that message translates (and has very explicitly been translated in the modern series) into an inclusion of different sexualities and different ethnic groups and different religions all being treated (as they should be) not only equally, but normally. E.g. the occasional character will just mention that they're not strait, in passing, and no fuss is made: everyone is just automatically accepted (example could be Skye from Midnight). That's a beautiful message to be passing on to audiences of any age :). It sounds bad, but I seriously think the baseline of my morality was built on mainly the Doctor, Dumbledore and Granny Weatherwax. I tweaked it here and there as I gt older and more worldly-wise and gained enough confidence to have faith in my own convictions, but they're basically all there sitting in the bottom of my heart, waving at me through my amendments, and the Doctor's morality is probably the most pervasive of the three. I would cite the immense value I place on loyalty to my friends, on the gathering of knowledge ( though a fair bit of that I'll claim as just natural me :P) and on seeing emotions as important to the point of sacred as linked to the tenth Doctor's attitudes.
Doctor Who the production rather than the story I support whole-heartedly as an excellently humble show that, despite it's immense importance to millions like me, it tends to pick up unknown - but brilliant - actors and let them shine in the main roles (and so give them a fantastic acting debut) and give celebrity actors dignified, but undeniably on-the-side-roles. I want to give Catherine Tate as an example here, as, although she was already a celebrity, it really gave her a chance to show the world what a stunning actress she is, as compared to the controversial and sliiightly crude comedian the world previously saw her as.
Finally, two things, one - when I first watching Doctor Who, it was classic DVDs my dad would bring home from 2003. He's now moved out and I don't see a lot of him, so there's nostalgic personal value there. It's a fantastic program for bonding - that makes it important to me too. I've formed at least two friendships through it, and one of the most touching things my boyfriend has done for me (in my opinion) is offer to spend time watching it together even though his opinion on it is generally more  'hm, yeah - this is ok' rather than my insane squeaky overexcited flailing. Secondly... I've forgotten what secondly was going to be, but instead I'll go with something of a summary. It's brilliant because it's funny, and emotional, and there's a pervading feeling that good and love and friendship and loyalty will win through that's considered twee and satirically picked apart by my peers, but that I've grown up with in my fairy tales and is important to my secretly held worldview. The Doctor is a force for good, and it links goodness with compassion and equality and pacifism and things that I value highly - things I believe would make the world a better place if others valued them as highly as the Doctor and his writers do. And there's magnificent, exquisite scenery (I don't care if it's CGI or just a quarry in Wales) and deep characters that you really get to know and love and beautiful cultures like that of the Ood that just make the universe of Doctor Who such an exquisite, free place. Plus escapism. Lots and lots of escapism. Oh, and I really like the humour too - the kind of gentle sarcasm Eccleston just made himself king of. But that's not something like the others that makes my heart swell up with pride or my eyes glaze over with awe or gratitude or... just plain love for it all I suppose. It's just an 'also it's really enjoyable to watch because I really appreciate the humour' kind of thing. Sorry for the length. Hi if you're still awake. You win if you reach the bottom ^^ :P.

* Read popular aeronautics or economics magazines (an example for science and tech in general is [New Scientist](http://www.newscientist.com/)). 
* Take a look at [MIT OpenCourseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) for some examples of college-level courses in whatever you're applying to do
* Try to get some relevant work experience (find a lab or company that are doing what you want to do and ask if you can visit them for a week. They'll probably be delighted!)

This and lack of a curriculum RE class and a few other bits are the most egregious things we need to sort out about faith schools immediately.

Really we need to be rid of religiously segregated schools full stop. This is a long term goal and the multi-faith/community Accord organisation campaigns for this well, as do the BHA and NSS but as Accord are fighting from within it seems to many people less of an attack purely on faith even though the NSS and BHA aren't attacking faith just public funded faith.

true,erythro,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;But you cant really make those things a qualifier.

Well, you can.  We are discussing a case where religion is a qualifier, and there are thousands more.  A youth worker in a church whose primary responsibility are classes like sunday school?  Religion has got to be a qualifier.  A missionary?  Religion has got to be a qualifier.  An imam, preist, vicar?  A ceo of a religious or athiest charity?  A chaplin of a certain, specific faith in the army (""we are short of sikh chaplins, and need them.  let's create a specific Job for sikhs that others cannot compete with so that we can support our sikh soldiers"", or whatever), or a faith school?  Religion has got to be a qualifier.

So many for religion.  Plenty for race too.  A certain part in a film, written to reflect a certain race?  You'd need to specify the race of the character.  How about a photo shoot for a skincare product, where you want a woman of every shade lined in a graduated line?  That is not rare.  If you needed the black woman, but had all the others, then you'd have to put that as a qualifier.  If you wanted to organise a fashion show around a ""white and black"" theme, you would want to use the shades of the model's skin as a part of your theme.  If you wanted a particular ethnicity to be a youth worker in a certain estate, as there was a latent racism in that estate where people of other races would be mistrusted and not respected.  Race would have to be a qualifier in these jobs.

I'll admit, there are less legit ones for race but I hope you get my point.",0,1346884397,null,0,false,0,c63zyv4,t3_ze1qf,t1_c63zyv4,t1_c63zlno,null,1429826561,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Please tell me why exactly it was necessary to cage these people for an extended period to figure out what happened.

Even if it is standard policy to arrest first and ask questions later, any such blanket policy is wrong, particularly in the context of the Human Rights Act 1998 inshrining the right to liberty in English law and requiring that any interference with that right be proportionate and necessary. If the police gave them the opportunity to attend the station for interview voluntarily instead of immediately slapping the cuffs on, it's highly unlikely they would have refused, and then the investigation could've proceeded without causing the problems for these **innocent people** that it now will.

This isn't the black and white issue that you're representing it as, and you're twisting my comments into pure sensationalism.

Furthermore, as I said in my first comment, I'd have much less of an issue with this if there weren't permanent consequences for an arrestee even if they are later released, but there are, and the police are well aware of that and should modify their procedures to account for it.

It's one of those things that no one likes to mention because so many of their fans were killed that day, but they were chucking rocks, fighting and generally causing agitation, every bit as thuggishly as those in red shirts. But LFC fans led the charge and a decrepit old stadium wall collapsed, therefore we take 100% of the blame for *everything* that occurred, and Juve fans get to act like their fans were entirely innocent.

I'm trying not to be blunt or inconsiderate here, because it was an utter tragedy and some LFC fans that day certainly had to shoulder a lot (not all) of the blame. But we also lost fans that day. One thing that gets me is that it was a tiny minority of our fans (I believe something like 17) that led the charge, but their entire travelling crowd [gave our tribute the uppers in 2005](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/05/29/heysel-anniversary-juventus-liverpool_n_1551780.html). So their entire fanbase gets to be assholes to our club because of 17 assholes on our side? Yes the assholes on our side caused a tragedy but like I say, Juve weren't blameless either. We unfairly but willingly take on 100% of the blame for the incident, and provide a tribute, and they're so deep in their fantasy of being blameless that they can turn around and shit all over our mark of respect?

I dunno. I think UEFA screwed up when they whitewashed everyone but us for that disaster because no one else had to take a look at themselves. Those fans were a fucking disgrace, but Juve fans certainly had a lot to do with it too but got off scot-free.

I'm not saying I know how they survive in he void I'm just saying its possible. There's no reason to believe anything could survive there for a second or an hour but maybe certain things can like the Cybermen and Adam from Torchwood Series 2. Why not the Devil himself?

You say its against the laws of physics but its the void. The laws are different because its not our reality. Its not any reality. Also, the Beast himself already contradicts the laws of physics. He's trapped on a planet under a black hole and doesn't fall in and can posses people while his body stays alive and moving. And like I said, the Cybermen that the Doctor sent to the void at the end of the battle must have survived there because they escaped it alive and went to Victorian London in 1851. They must have been in the void for at least a bit to steal the Daleks time machine to get to 1851 and to steal their infostamps. 

I'm pretty sure a human would die there but Cybermen and certainly The Beast are different. If he IS before our Universe he may not have to comply to this universes laws of physics and could have survived in the void when that Universe ended.

All I'm saying is you can't always use the laws of physics to dismiss things when this is Doctor Who. The maddest most impossible SciFi ever that contradicts physics all the time.

Seems like the same logic that says people who become actors deserve to be followed and photographed, their private life laid bare, because they're in the ""public eye"".

Their motto is - believing in children, learning together - and they make their focus on the sectarian nature of faith schools more than anything else. Which the BHA (who are an affiliated organisation) and NSS do as well admittedly but as I said being headed by a rabbi and having significant faith elements to it means the more religiously inclined are less likely to think it is an attack on them.

I'm pretty sure faith schools will be looked back on as a horrible mistake and one that undoubtedly increased racial and religious tensions.

I think I'm nicking this argument from a comedian Scott Agnew when he was on the doubling up podcast but for the most part, the highly educated (who know by basic facts and reasoning that despite differences people are basically people) and the people who are educated in diverse schools (who know they are the same as they are their friends) aren't racist.

The problem is the surprising amount of people who grow up in predominantly white environments and don't have a much of an education and who are still casually. or out and out, racist. By increasing this separation at the most important time of their lives they will only increase racism and community tensions and an us vs them mentality.

How?! How does it do that? You set up a Muslim school: How many non-Muslims are going to go? Couple to that the number of kids from Muslim families who now won't be in non-Muslim schools.

Similarly if you set up a CoE school in any area with more than a few Muslims it's likely that some kids from Muslim families won't be going there and therefore aren't integrating with children from non-Muslim households.

It's ridiculous, and that's without even touching on whether or not children should be instructed in a religion, rather than taught about all religions.

true,aqaspecification,null,null," Hi. Yes those are probably good enough. What will clinch it though is your performance on the physics aptitude test that you need to take in November (for both engineering and physics) and the interview (which you will get if your aptitude test score is good enough). I don't know how likely teachers are to predict you A*s if your AS marks were below 90 but if you are going to try and convince them to do so focus on the maths because an A prediction in that could disadvantage you. More importantly you might want to think carefully about applying for physics or engineering at Oxford if you struggle with maths because they are both extremely maths heavy subjects.

You cannot apply for straight economics in Oxford, you have to apply for either PPE, economics and management, history and economics, materials, economics and management or engineering, economics and management (heavy stuff). Since you haven't taken any humanities I'd say PPE or history and economics are off the cards but you could certainly apply for any of the others (although I would warn you that they all happen to be some of the most ludicrously competitive subjects you can apply for). It is possible to change course once accepted but they would never let you do so immediately after acceptance as it'd kinda be taking the piss. Generally if people change subjects it's after their first year, whether you're allowed to or not is totally the decision of your college (which makes it infamously inconsistent) and would be based on how well you've done in your first year, whether the subject your changing to is more or less prestigious than the one you're transferring from, why you want to change, and all sorts of other stuff, so basically don't bank on it.

I have no idea about applying for Cambridge but you might be a little handicapped by your maths mark as unlike Oxford Cambridge get your UMS marks.

EDIT: I've noticed a couple of comments talk about offers. As far as I'm aware pretty much any science will be an A* AA offer and any humanity will be AAA.

Fast forward to a few months ago, amidst probably the most difficult time I've ever gone through in my life (and am still going through now): caught in limbo awaiting a decision which is literally the difference between life and death for me, unsure of what the future holds, and feeling the weight of illness and far too many years on my back.  Ensconced in the van I call home, watching the only broadcast channel I could manage to tune in on my TV, I found myself watching a surprisingly interesting show.  Had no idea what was going on, but I was intrigued...

...and then David Tennant regenerated, and I had just enough residual cultural awareness to realize I was watching, and ""NO NO NO NOOOOO!""ed at the TV set as I became aware that after forty-plus years, that damned show had sucked me in at last.

Grudgingly, unwillingly, I found myself tuning in the following week to watch an episode properly from the beginning.  I'll hate it, I told myself.  It'll be awful, I told myself.  I'll never, ever watch it again, I promised myself.

The episode in question was a rebroadcast of The Eleventh Hour.  Yeah, so much for promises.

What drew me in - and what still pulls me in now, and why Eleven will always be ""my"" Doctor - is the juxtaposition between the young face and the old eyes, the 'tawdry quirks' and ridiculous mannerisms masking the power and the fury and the regret within.  Matt Smith's portrayal of the Doctor reminds me of how I feel, so much of the time: too old to be young, too young to be old, at home everywhere and never quite fitting in anywhere, and so very, very alone.  And yet with all the potential for bitterness and pain, his Doctor still manages to see the world through the eyes of a child (Amy, really) - with delight and reverence and limitless curiosity - and never gives up, no matter how stacked the odds may be or how impossible the situation may seem.

It is the message I so desperately needed to hear, and the example I so dearly needed to see, presented to me at exactly the time I most needed to receive it.

And that is what Doctor Who means to me.  Hope, in the face of hopelessness, and courage in the face of despair, and that ridiculous sort of courage that stares down impossible odds and boldly declares:  Bowties?  Are *cool*.

true,gusset25,welsh,Wales,"i seem to be the only UK discrimination lawyer in this thread, so i'll weigh in.

i would have advised the company that the ad is unlawful.

first, ads didn't used to be able to be unlawful in themselves; to be eligible to bring a claim, you used to have to apply, get rejected and then point to the ad and your [atheism, for example] to show you got rejected unlawfully. now, the ad is evidence that the employer has discriminated in *the arrangements made for deciding to whom to offer employment* - s39(1)(c) of the Equality Act 2010.

anyway, onto the question everyone wants answered.

as Gavchap says below, the defence of the requirement being an ""occupational requirement"" (because of the employer's religious ethos) is a narrow one. It must be ""a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim"".

The employer needs to show that the requirement is **proportionate** when considering the nature of the job and the context within which it is carried out. 

Proportionality is given a narrow meaning in this area of law. It means the thing should not be given any wider meaning than is necessary and appropriate for the reason given (eg the employer's religious ethos).

[Acas had a stab](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:xv8m3Wd17IAJ:www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/9/j/guide_religionB_1.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESj0SIkYx-bfXkfWlK0qPgoidUBqySn29efCAYkGX-LUSvOBcBUjwg1cz__i11O-M9tGbh0wMjyjUyDqk2cVs0Uk-DdIMvcGoXsAS-kksTz2L0OmIW_yDmqsh4hBCOwwFbVYSCeQ&amp;sig=AHIEtbRcwO0Tkhtxx-dXX9xsF4FtqBPCnQ) at giving an example: 

&gt;**Example**: A faith based care home may be able to show that being of a particular faith is a genuine requirement of its carers because they are required to carry out their duties in a manner that fulfills both the physical and spiritual needs of its patients.

&gt;However, they may not be able to justify a similar requirement for their
maintenance or reception staff whose jobs do not require them to
provide spiritual leadership or support to the patients.

Well done to Acas for going out on a limb in the absence of a helpful piece of caselaw.

The [explanatory notes](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/notes/division/3/16/26/1) to the Equality Act give another example:

&gt;A religious organisation may wish to restrict applicants for the post of head of its organisation to those people that adhere to that faith. This is because to represent the views of that organisation accurately it is felt that the person in charge of that organisation must have an in-depth understanding of the religion's doctrines. This type of discrimination could be lawful. However, other posts that do not require this kind of in-depth understanding, such as administrative posts, should be open to all people regardless of their religion or belief

If the purpose is to ensure the candidates have a good understanding of the religion's doctrines, my view is that study =/= belief. someone might have studied the religion to the extent that they know more about it than the typical believer. 

I see no reason why an applicant cannot ""work within a Christian framework and be sensitive to its various expressions across cultures and denominations"" without being ""a committed Christian"". I'm not even convinced that a media executive (as opposed to a frontline service-providing employee) needs to uphold the employer's christian ethos for the employer to be able to provide its service according to that ethos.

My view is therefore that the organisation that placed the ad is in breach of the law.

I would like to see my view tested in a court of law. A redditor should sue. Or a bunch of us. ",0,1346894215,null,0,1346894736,0,c642ib1,t3_ze1qf,t1_c642ib1,t3_ze1qf,null,1429827883,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

What Doctor Who means to me is friendship. I get that there's probably a lot deeper meanings I could take from it, but ultimately it boils down to a very sad old man who just wants to take his friends on adventures and give them the times of their lives. So when I introduced my best friend to Who, that's what it was for me.

I think Dempsey is going to be a great pick up. He can play on the right or left, and he's a natural second striker who likes to cut inside from the flanks. This means that Lennon or Bale can go back to being stretch the field wingers when he starts, which is probably where they are the most comfortable and which is how AVB ran his 433 at Porto.  One wide man hugs the line, the other cuts into the box. 

As for Kane and Hudd, I was just kind of saying that with Kane as young as he is and Hudds injury problems you don't really know what you can expect from either. They both certainly have loads of potential.

They probably needed concrete proof. Sacking with anything less leaves yourself open to wrongful dismissal. It's possible you may have to prove in a tribunal that the theft occurred so that the firing on the spot for gross misconduct is valid. The more blatantly solid it is the less likely the employee will kick up a fuss, saving the employer money &amp; time.

In this case the driver could say he honestly got the wrong house and the person there signed for it. The signer then maybe got paranoid and ditched it at a random address figuring that the driver might remember which house it was when asked later. It would be hard to prove otherwise, hell, there's a slim chance this may be what happened!

If he admits it he'll get a written warning for this which would only lead to a sacking if he has a history of misconduct. If he denies it they'll keep an eye on him and probably pounce on anything in the future.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"The web uses ""http"" to download web pages. Anyone with access to the connection can passively read things. Most notably wifi hotspots though it's possible with 3G etc, just harder. Web traffic can be wrapped in something called ""SSL"" to encrypt it, this makes up ""https"".

Most serious websites like banks automatically force you onto https before you login. If they didn't then others could read your password or ""session ID"". This is usually as good as a password. This has to get sent with every request for a page you make so that they know it's you. 

Encryption is expensive for large sites because it is very processor intensive, some major players buy special hardware for it. A lot of sites would log you in on https then drop you back to http when you start browsing. Pointless really.

Facebook only stopped doing it recently following a lot of bad press about how easy it was to steal someone's session ID and take over their account. Someone even made a firefox plugin to make the process simple. 

Because many sites are lax in these security matters HTTPS Everywhere forces your browser to use https on the ones it knows about. IIRC it re-writes the links on pages so that they always the https version. So, back when Facebook was filling it's page with links to the ""http"" version, the plugin made them take you to the ""https"" version, keeping your IDs private.

If a time lord escaped and used a void ship or some other means of technology to exist outside the universe, or perhaps used some other tech to preserve themselves at the eye of the storm (least affected part) then it is logical.

Example: Close all the doors and windows in your house on a cold day. Go into one room with a heater. This is the universe. Turn on the heater for long enough to heat the room; this is the light of the Pandorica. Now exit that room. You no longer feel the heat generated because the universe is sealed. You can enter the room the following day and feel no heat. This logic shows that anything outside the universe would not have felt the effects of the cracks in time, or the light of the Pandorica.

true,Quazifuji,null,null,"&gt;And Rory trying to help the Dalek...he would. Such a dork at times.

It was definitely in character for Rory, but it's also in a way kind of a theme that's been going on since ""Dalek"" in season 1.  One of the big lessons the Doctor always imparts on every companion is to always hear both sides of the story and never dismiss an alien as just a big vicious monster before you know what it is and what it wants.  The big exception for him has always been the Daleks.

You're still forgetting that the light of the Pandorica only reached every point in space and time *INSIDE* the universe. Were a time lord to escape the time war through a crack in time, then venture *OUTSIDE* of the universe, A) they would be unaffected by the cracks in time and B) the light of the Pandorica wouldn't reach outside of the universe and couldn't possibly affect anything (it can't pull anything outside of the universe back into its original place if it can't reach outside the universe to do so).

I never went into whether or not a double would be created inside the time war after Big Bang 2, my point is that something which may have escaped the universe before Big Bang 2 could potentially still exist outside, and re-enter the universe at a later point.

Your only reasoning against this hypothesis is that ""we didn't see it happen so it can't have happened"". Yes, I understand that the universe has been restored from an imprint, I stated that before. I never said that it would change. This hypothesis relies on events from during Season 5 staying in history, which did happen (explained below).

You have to remember also, that the deeds performed by The Doctor (everything in ""The Eleventh Hour"") still happened in the rebooted universe as they're referenced by clerics of the church in ""A Good Man Goes to War"". The whole ""everything will go back to the way it was, none of this ever have happened and nobody will remember"" thing that River said before The Doctor flew the Pandorica into the heart of the explosion has been proven wrong. There's also the fact that Craig still knows who The Doctor is in ""Closing Time"". Had these events been erased from history, they wouldn't have that relationship nor would Craig have any memory of anything happening, yet he did.

Think non-linear. Think outside of The Doctor's personal timeline. Sure, Doctor Who is written somewhat linear because that's how we watch the episodes. We don't watch TV 4th dimensionally. That's just silly. But just because episodes flow in a linear fashion, doesn't mean things can't happen elsewhere in the Whoniverse (or outside) without our knowledge. It's exactly how they explained the ending to Season 6. [spoiler](#s ""We don't see his interactions with the Tesselector until the end of the episode."") Who's to say that events from Season 5 which we've not seen, can't be written into the series several seasons later? They don't have to directly correlate to the events we're shown in Season 5.

Who's to say that events from Season 5 can't be written into the series several seasons later? They don't have to directly correlate to the events we're shown in Season 5.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"&gt;Series 5 seems like a whole different show **than what Russell Davies had started**.

To be quite blunt, this is the attitude that's going to kill it for you. Not saying there's nothing wrong with liking the RTD era, but at the same time you have to realize that he didn't start Doctor Who, not by a long shot. Now, obviously, you probably realize this, but I've noticed that a lot of people's eyes get tainted when all they know of Doctor Who is RTD, and it really hurts in the transition to Moffat, who brings back a more classical flair to Doctor Who.

RTD really changed Doctor Who, and a lot of what Doctor Who was about. If there were to be a large departure from the series, it would certainly be his era. Some liked that, and others didn't. However, just like those that watched through the RTD era, despite not liking the change at first, you have to accept that the show is just going to change. Whether you have someone like RTD who completely redesigns what Doctor Who is all about, or you have someone like Moffat who prefers to write a 21st century version of a 1960s scifi show. Some day Moffat himself will step down, and the show will once more become something new. Just like The Doctor, it's this 'regeneration' that has kept the show going for so long. If it didn't change so much, then it would just be known as that quirky British show that didn't last beyond the late 1960s.

And, one more thing, you're probably going to have to watch Moffat era episodes a few times to really get into them. If there is one aspect of Moffat and RTD are diametrically opposed on, I think, it's the subtly of writing. RTD was very much about putting what was going on, the moral implications, the emotions, everything right on the edge of the TV screen. Moffat, on the other hand, loves a more subtle approach, to leave emotions implied, and have the moral implications more layered throughout the writing. I assure you, it's all still there, but it's just written differently than with RTD, and the more you can see it, I think the more you can enjoy it.

A simple example off the top of my head would be from Rose and The Eleventh Hour, RTD and Moffat's first episodes as lead writers, respectively. Both introduce a 'strong female' and a 'weak male' boyfriend. To introduce them as 'weak' to the audience, RTD almost paints his as a sniveling caricature, grabbing at Rose's arm as he says she' can't go with The Doctor, as she goes anyway. Moffat, on the other hand, introduces his 'weak male' by showing him at work where he tries to explain that his patients are calling for the 'Doctor', and he has several pictures of them walking around outside. His boss makes remarks about how he's wasting her time, and he says nothing and acts nervous, as he has no real spine to speak back to her. And then it's shown even more where his role in the Amy/Rory relationship is in the fact that she doesn't even consult him before running off with The Doctor, unlike Rose did with Mickey.

Probably not the best example, but I'm tired, and it still helps show a bit of the differences. Personally, I'm the opposite of you. I love Moffat's style over RTD, but I can also understand how someone can enjoy RTD over Moffat. It's like choosing Ray Bradbury over Arthur C Clark, or Star Trek over Star Wars. There's nothing wrong with people who like one over the other. But, with Doctor Who, you'll also have to accept that the show will change, start over, and move on, whether or not you like the direction it's going. Your best bet is to try and find something you enjoy about it, try and understand where the writer is coming from, and remember that it's still The Doctor. And, if the show never changed, it would have been cancelled decades ago, and it's no different in the 21st century.",0,1346916337,null,0,false,0,c647emj,t3_zfl0b,t1_c647emj,t3_zfl0b,null,1429830204,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

true,OneMonthWhovian,tardis,TARDIS,"&gt;If there is one aspect of Moffat and RTD are diametrically opposed on, I think, it's the subtly of writing. RTD was very much about putting what was going on, the moral implications, the emotions, everything right on the edge of the TV screen. Moffat, on the other hand, loves a more subtle approach, to leave emotions implied, and have the moral implications more layered throughout the writing.

You know, I've already tried to look at it that way while I was watching, but as I watched more and more of series 5, I can't help but see Moffat as the less subtle writer. The story arc for S5 is plastered all over the place. It's like Moffat wrote a big story, then separated that into smaller stories. Whereas RTD lets the characters drive the story arc--it's not the big series ender that makes the arc substantial, it's how the characters evolved through everything that they experienced.

Sure, S5 is less dramatic, but not because it's subtle. It's because there are less emotions involved and less character-driven writing. When Amy Pond was on the brink of death because of that angel in her eye, I can't even sympathize or empathize, because the show hasn't given me anything to hold on to. I don't even know why the Doctor would even want to desperately save her, and why he keeps her around in the first place.

I've flown with Ryanair only when necessary to get to my destination without an horrendous round trip to avoid them, but mostly my experience of them has been ok.

However, the last time I flew with them, there was no room in the overhead lockers for my coat, but the stewardess wouldn't let me have it on my lap or by my feet during the flight for godknowswhat reason.  I therefore had to wear it the entire flight, getting quite hot and feeling ill.

After the pilot slapped the plane down on the runway like he was playing the first level of Flight Simulator, I rushed off the plane when permitted after the cabin doors opened (to get some air) to find there was no bus waiting to take us to the airport and the stewardess had stopped the passengers after me.  This left me standing on a runway by myself for a good few minutes wondering what to do.  Eventually I was asked to get back on the plane, and got to the terminal some time later, promptly needed to empty my stomach in the toilets due to the combination of the coat enduced sickness and the slapdown landing.

Benefits is a huge huge problem and unfortunately some innocent people are getting caught in the crossfire.

They're attacking all of it (overzealously as I mentioned earlier) to try and shake the problem as unfortunately Labour's soft touch approach did nothing.

It's not personal, it's just that they have to do something about it and be seen to be doing something. It's a tough pill to swallow sure, but Labour didn't have the balls to make anyone take it.

I will attempt to explain why.

1) the end of Rodgers optimism

OK so this is pretty much your opinion, if 3 games in and two bad results is enough to shake your confidence then ok there's not much anyone can do about that. I kind of just feel sorry for you.

I would also say that if LFC had people with your attitude on the pitch then it would be the end of my optimism too.

2) Incompetence

Clearly we don't agree on the definition of the word incompetence.

FSG have spent more cash in less time than at any other point in the clubs history and wiped off all the clubs debts. Personally I welcome their tighter grip on the purse strings. I also welcome the additions to the squad that have been made this season.

I assume by management you also include Rodgers.

To be honest his level of incompetence is kind of irrelevant. If he dressed all the players up in duck outfits and made them pound the ball into their own net it is entirely up to him.

If he then waited til XMas and took us on an unbeaten run that saw is get 5th in the table I would be entirely satisfied.

ENGLISH FOOTBALL IS PLAYED OVER AN ENTIRE SEASON.

No need to judge his competence yet relax we've got months to form an intelligent well thought out opinion on Brendan Rodgers.

&gt;
&gt;In the context of the scene, it sounds like he's challenging the Daleks because he's in their clutches; he's a Christmas gift to them. But as foreshadowing, it actually means something else: the idea that someone needs to be remembered at around Christmastime, and Oswin is the likeliest candidate since she's the one that stresses the importance of the Doctor remembering her. 

After ""Asylum of the Daleks"" was over, and I was contemplating the meaning of various things concerning JLC's appearance in the episode, I pointed out something to my wife: that in the first Series 7 trailer distributed last March, there were a LOT of scenes in it from the 3rd episode, ""A Town Called Mercy"" (the ""wild west"" one), including [this part](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLKGePNr61k&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=41s) where the Doctor asked, ""has someone been peeking at my Christmas list?""

Although this is my first time mentioning it here on r/DoctorWho, back this past Saturday I wondered aloud to my wife whether there would be some little thing said about Christmas in every episode of the first half of this series/season, right up until the actual Christmas special this year where JLC is introduced as the new companion.

As far as it goes, I'm still thinking of JLC as ""Clara,"" rather than ""Oswin,"" in her permanent role on the show as companion.  Could the name Clara be a red herring as the OP suggests?  Sure, maybe, anything's possible.  But then again, why does it have to be?  OP responds to the comment, ""*but I don't know how Oswin would be brought back into the real world*"" by rightly pointing out that ""*the writers can literally make up any process they want*""...sure, that's certainly true, and of course the writers can surely make up any process they want to change Oswin to Clara, too.

As far as the post by erisacrat about how the Christmas special may be based upon The Nutcracker, I've got something to bring up about that: while I've never seen The Nutcracker myself and only have pop culture references to it for me to draw upon as a reference (please, don't piss all over me for never having seen it...since most of us are humans and not Time Lords, nobody has enough time in the world to watch, read, musically enjoy, or play EVERYTHING that everybody else thinks they ought to!) the scene in ""Asylum"" where Amy sees the Daleks as dancing people makes me wonder if that is supposed to look a bit Nutcracker-ish.  Most of the people there where fancy-dress-ball types, but there was at least one dancing ballerina wearing a tiara as I recall.

assuming Oswin is the new companion (have no idea where the whole Clara/Oswin thing comes in, maybe it's just a red herring, maybe Moffat changed his mind about the name at one point - doesn't matter), I think it's very likely that the doctor and Oswin did meet in the right order. We've just seen that the Daleks can disguise themselves in human forms. So what if Oswin, being brilliant and all, manages to survive at the end of AotD (emergency temporal shift or whatever, there are ways) and just comes back in human form, but still a Dalek. She meets the doctor, has to convince him she's not proper Dalek and gain his trust.

It is far too easy to reserve all the positive adjectives for the things that society considers commendable, and vice versa.  But I honestly do think that it would take serious stones, or serious desperation, to burgle someone's house.  This does not mean that it is not immoral, or hugely inconsiderate, or an incredibly stupid and cold hearted thing to do.  I just don't know if courage is necessarily conditional on morality.  The quote at the end of the piece shows how this kind of thinking leads to a lack of empathy and regardless of what crime has been committed I think that empathy (as in the capacity to recognise their motives and feelings) to all parties is beneficial to a fair trial.

As said, it seems odd for the judge to raise this in court, but I think it is also disingenuous of the media to claim that the judge issued a soft sentence because he showed courage.  I think there are enough examples of burglars to get off with a slap on the wrist to demonstrate that it is probably not through his 'courage' alone that the burglar got off.  The judge is clearly jaded as to the potential of prison to appropriately deal with crime and has sentenced according to his feelings on the matter, which is certainly something that as a society we need to debate.

The character's name in Asylum of the Daleks is *Oswin Oswald*...she says it plainly to the Doctor when the first communicate (while the Doctor, Amy and Rory are still in the big Dalek Parliament room).

The only place I've seen the name ""definitively"" refered to as ""Clara Oswin"" is the IMDB, and then only after the Asylum episode debuted.  And here's the thing people don't realize about IMDB: it's like WikiPedia, in that all the information is supplied by just regular ol' people.  Anyone can submit a piece of info to the IMDB site, and if it sounds ""good"" to the person screening it, then it goes up on the actual page(s).  IMDB is regularly wrong because of this.  Folks that work for studios regularly try to get corrections made and keep everything at IMDB accurate, but if the correction amounts to a spoiler - like it could in this case - then they will leave it alone until ""later.""

So putting the IMDB (and WikiPedia, and similar ""anybody can add any wrong info""-type sites) aside, can you please point me to a source where someone who's clearly in-the-know says that the character's name is ""Clara Oswin""?  Because I've been looking for one, and cannot find it.

But then again, that type of story could itself be a red herring...I remember when spoilery pics popped up of Amy and River (the latter wearing a camo outfit) online long before ""The Wedidng of River Song"" aired, and they tried to say that this was a fake scene, a red herring, but then the episode finally aired and there it all was.

No, it's far closer to 'unjust enrichment'.  The lack of dishonest intent is the key point.

The Barclays are claiming that the law says A, and HMRC interpret it to mean B.  There is no case to claim that the Barclays are dishonest in their interpretation - but that does not stop them being wrong.

1. John @ PWC - Sure, he might not be an everyman, but is that his job? I thought it was being a tax/accountancy expert? Or is he not one of those because he doesn't use his hands to work? Ad hominem attacks on him personally do not bely the facts, figures and numbers represented by the BBC article.

2. I can offer you up the HMRC's own review into the 50p tax rate - it makes some very interesting reading.

- Net income for the affected group dropped by 20% to avoid the new tax, equity in the affected group dropped by a whopping 30%. (Read, they basically moved their money to dodge the increase).

- Net income from taxation of high earners had grown by 14% in 2009-10 taxation year. It then dropped actually dropped by 25% in 10/11 due to ""Forestalling"" read (moving cash quick to dodge the rise).

Directly relating to emigration;

&gt;4.22 In a survey carried out for the Skandia life assurance company, 55.9 per cent of high net 
&gt;worth individuals would consider moving abroad under certain circumstances. High taxation was 
&gt;the most frequently cited reason for considering leaving the UK with 31 per cent of respondents.  
&gt;4.23 Figures from the Swiss Federal Migration Office showed that 383 British citizens working 
&gt;in banking and financial services moved to Switzerland in 2010, an increase of 28 per cent on the 
&gt;previous year. Under the broader rubric of banking, insurance and consulting, which includes IT, 
&gt;1,379 Britons were given permission to work long-term in Switzerland in 2010. This is an increase 
&gt;of 29 per cent over the 2009 figure. The Federal Migration Office points out that the economic 
&gt;recovery is a factor in the increased migration rate. But the increase in the rate of immigration of
&gt;Britons in financial services exceeds that of other nationalities. Excluding Britons, the increase in 
&gt;financial services migration was 14 per cent, half as much as the British rate.

In all - your beloved 50p tax rate actually cut the treasuries receipts and is projected to have a mutli year negative impact. Additionally people have and are projected to leave because of it.

So when we moved from dial-up access (which needed a password etc) to broadband the wife and I decided that trying to filter it was a waste of time and money, if they wanted to look at naked people they were going to find away to do it.  We had a talk with all of the kids about some of the things they might see 'by accident', that whilst it was natural to be curious, they were sharing a computer with other people who might not like it, how they should never share personal information with people online and that they should speak to us if they saw something that upset them. 

Until they were 15-16 they shared a PC in the living room, and being the good brothers and sisters they are, they'd break their necks to come tell us if one of the others had been looking at pics of a naked Brad Pitt/Britney Spears when we went shopping.

Baker (could bake cakes and bread etc from your house and sell to others).
Car Cleaner (variation on window cleaning, can't tell me everyone owns the cars).
Ironing for cash (I keep trying to tell my mum to do this, her friends hate ironing but she loves it, could do it for a fiver for a basket).
Handyman - just need some tools for random jobs (cash in hand possible wink wink nudge nudge).
Fence painting - could also get the customer to pay for the paint - quids in (mark it up with a tasty percentage).
etc etc etc

I realise I may sound completely simplistic when I argue this, but I disagree on your point that there is no room for morals in business, law, economy and wealth. There is a room for morality if we see these areas as a product of a mutual beneficiary system than an individual endeavour .

true,MarcusOrlyius,null,null,"&gt;Why would you have to buy an existing round?

That's just how that business works. Same with hot dog vans and stuff like that. Drug dealing also uses the same model. If you try and set up shop on someone else's turf, things get violent.

&gt;However, if I pretend to agree with your point, let's think of any other businesses you could start with little to no money.

What good is it to start a business if you can't get any customers? How do you get customers? Marketing, which costs a fair amount of money.

&gt;Baker (could bake cakes and bread etc from your house and sell to others). Car Cleaner (variation on window cleaning, can't tell me everyone owns the cars). Ironing for cash (I keep trying to tell my mum to do this, her friends hate ironing but she loves it, could do it for a fiver for a basket). Handyman - just need some tools for random jobs (cash in hand possible wink wink nudge nudge). Fence painting - could also get the customer to pay for the paint - quids in (mark it up with a tasty percentage). etc etc etc

You wouldn't make enough to live on from any of those, except maybe the handyman and you'd still need to money for marketing. Starting a business can be simple, making it successful is a completely different story though. If you think a baker working from their council house could possibly make enough to live on, you are simply delusional. At most they might sell a couple of loaves to their neighbours depending on what they charged.

&gt;Even running a simple stall - few quid at the start to buy some stuff, get £50 quids worth of stock, add a margin of £20. Bang, then buy £70 of products and sell for £100. So on and so forth.

Except you can't just set up a stall, you need permission and there has to be space for the new stall, which there usually isn't.

If it wasn't the first two seasons with her, it was third with Martha fawning over him while he gets over her, or the fourth with Donna not really thinking about him in that way but having her come back in the end.  I think people were tied into the companions more then they were with the new ones since they didn't link together with Rose like the first four seasons did. 

The new seasons just kind of have Amy, who is cool, but not overly interesting.  Personally I prefer Rory over Amy since Amy is kind of bland overall in terms of how she was introduced.  I think a lot of people don't like the River Arc sequences, but if it wasn't for her the last two seasons would have been unbearable.  I still enjoy the 5th and 6th season, but not nearly as much as the fourth or third.  However that is just my two cents on why there is a disconnect with the characters.

Median UK salary for a full-time worker is £23k. And of course, half of working people earn LESS than that.
After tax, that's £18k. Council tax takes another £1.1k on average with single occupancy discount
Rent on a 1-2 bedroom place is likely to be £500-700/month = £6-8.4k/yr
Then bills at another £150/month = £1.8k

Running a car - horribly expensive. And we haven't factored in leisure activities, gym subscription, mobile phone, technology, meals out or anything else.

Consider that an average house costs £190k, and you'll need a 10% deposit to get a decent rate. Good luck *ever* saving that on £18k/yr. Especially when paying over the odds on rent.

It's impossible to know if they were correct in retrospect of course, but I'm pretty sure that the LibDems felt that it was probably the Tories or a second election in short order &amp; that the former was the lesser of two evils.

It didn't help that Labour were utterly incompetent in actually negotiating with the LibDems &amp; had simply assumed before the election that they would fall into line and go into coalition with them regardless if that's what it took.

true,electrikyle,null,null,"Your comments about Christmas made me think, ""How could the Doctor *know* about what's going on already?""  So the first question *haha* is 'At what point in the Doctor's personal timeline is he captured in the beginning?'

So, I rewatched the beginning, which at the time just kind of flitted by.  The woman claims her daughter ""Hannah"" is in a Dalek prison camp and needs the Doctor's help.  It isn't until after the Doctor realizes she's not possibly human that she changes form - just like the Alaskan worker outside the ship actually *helps* Amy locate the others before turning.  So there could be a grain of truth to the woman's daughter being held in a Dalek prison camp.  Could this 'Hannah' be the Oswin we met?  It seems almost too simple.

Now, one thing that bothered me during the episode was, 'How can Oswin's voice be coming over the intercom, if in person she speaks in Dalekvoice?'  Obviously in her own mind, she believes she is human - her clothes, her behaviors.. We are to believe at the end that it was all internally made up - but what if it wasn't?

As I rewatched the beginning, I noticed the setting and some of the camera moves.  We pan up to an ancient rusty Dalek's eye-stalk, and then we see the Doctor captured.  At the very end, we see the Dalek ship through a circle-shaped window, and suddenly it comes together that we're *inside* a Dalek.  So technically, Oswin could be as well - a miniature prisoner inside a Dalek to convince her that she *was* Dalek.  Let's expand that theory.  Amy saw people where there were Daleks.  Why were their lasers removed or disabled?  What if the entire asylum *was* the prison camp referred to in the beginning, and the entire episode was a ploy to have the Doctor unknowingly kill a planet full of innocent human prisoners?

Many times last season it was established that the Doctor is his own worst enemy - this could be a very real manifestation of that, where he has to prevent his past actions and save the prisoners before he blows up the planet.

And I totally think you're right - I could very easily see the Christmas special being the Nutcracker.  There is a dream world in that story, and perhaps Oswin is somehow in the dream world.

true,impablomations,northumberland,Northumberland,"As it stands at the minute - to get DLA you are judge on your ability to walk 200m.

For the benefit that replaces it, PIP, that has been slashed by 75% to 50m.

So if you can walk 50m but no more, then you will not be entitled to the upper rate of DLA, meaning you can no longer qualify for Motability.

I can walk up to 50m, with a couple of rests along the way, so under the new rules I will lose my motability car which I depend on to get out of the house.  The nearest bus stop is 160m away, even if I could get to the bus stop - once I reach the nearest supermarket with electric scooters for customers (ASDA) that is 400m from the bus stop to the doors of the supermarket.

Once again I will be housebound, only leaving the house once a week to go shopping by taxi, unable to work because I can't travel on public transport.

My best friend has both legs amputated below the knee, since she has prosthetics (but can only walk about 100m on them), she will also lose her entitlement to the upper rate  - meaning she will lose her specially adapted car that enables her to be able to work.  It costs £5000 for adaptations to the car, so instead of being a taxpaying member of society, she will have to leave her job since she won't be able to travel.

Even in the Govt. own consultation paper, they have a case study of a guy with 1 leg who can't use his prosthetic outside due to other disabilities and has to use a wheelchair when outside his house - in their OWN words, he will also no longer qualify.

While DLA is indeed not perfect (It's not as easy to get as most people think - it took me two appeals and a tribunal, since they decided to ignore evidence from 2 surgeons and 3 consultants), it's still miles better than the gigantic clusterfuck that is PIP.",0,1346944117,null,0,false,0,c64b5mw,t3_zepf5,t1_c64b5mw,t1_c64ax3o,null,1429832035,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

There's not more running and not more shouting than in RTD, and running in DW is *fun*, even, but...I always have trouble ""getting"" into an episode, like I didn't use to have during series 1-4. I was definitely much more involved with people running for their lives from the Daleks on the satellite, or Donna crying because of what had been done to the Ood, or even Martha having to deal with Shakespeare's flirting attempts than with anything that happens in Moffat's run.

Given the tendency of automated filters to be hugely overzealous and cause large amounts of collateral damage, I can forsee at least two of those categories (Suicide and self harm) causing a huge amount of real harm, as support sites wind up getting blocked along with whatever else fits into that category. 

In practise it will no doubt be implemented the same way mobile network providers implement blocking now. Almost everything of value will be blocked, and opt-out requests will be so common that they will simply be processed automatically by charging and refunding a provided credit-card.

You're the one bleating on about the country being hard done to yet you choose to take a savings account where the interest isn't taxed instead of taking one out where the interest would be taxed. You are therefore participating in tax avoidance. The fact the govt set it up is completely and utterly irrelevant. 

What about people who make pension contributions? What about people who take child care vouchers in lieu of wages? Both are tax avoidance. Both deny HMRC revenue they would have otherwise got.

When you buy something from Ebay that comes from China and when it arrives, you're not sent a bill for VAT and/or import duty do you phone up HM Customs and offer to pay or do you keep your mouth shut like millions of people? After all, if you don't that is tax evasion which is actually illegal.

I'd say your expected utilities, groceries and travel costs estimates are pretty ok.

But if you want a decent one bedroom flat for £850 you may be disappointed. You got to be lucky to find something decent in that price range which is a one bedroom flat, you could probably find an ok studio for that price though, but to find a one bedroom for that price it's going to be very basic and will probably be on the poorly maintained or even smelly side. Go on [this](http://www.findaproperty.com/) website to get an idea. I personally haven't had any particularly good experiences with one bedroom flats in the £850 price range, the pictures usually look better than if you go there IRL.

How long ago did you leave London? If you're on that sort of income you might want to invest in a property and rent out some of the rooms. Housing is good money, renting is money wasted after all. Then again I rent so it's not like I'm adverse to the idea of renting, but then again I'm not on a 39k salary.
