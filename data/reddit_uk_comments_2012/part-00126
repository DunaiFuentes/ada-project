I think that's exactly why the Doctor was so sensitive about it. He knows that they're basically the same. 

They both did terrible things in order to end a war. The Doctor always carries that with him and beats himself up about it constantly. He takes responsibility for his actions. Then the ""Alien Doctor"" thinks he can just forget about it and pretend to be innocent, shirking responsibility for it. Abandoning the burden he deserved. 

And this is why the Doctor pulled a gun on him and marched him to his death.

true,Skyblacker,rory,Rory,"&gt; There are other ways, like details to her makeup to make her eyes look more tired, etc. to show that she's either not sleeping well or something. 


Good point, especially since we've already seen that with the Doctor. In the same episode, I've noticed him looking haggard and then youthful, possibly due to makeup, lighting, and just how the actor faces the camera. Amy could look stressed out, but she doesn't, and other fans have remarked upon how unnaturally chill she and Rory seem to be about losing Melody. I think Rory has visibly aged a bit, though, and he might be more easily stressed than Amy just because he didn't even want to travel with the Doctor in the first place. I still get the impression that he only goes along with it for her sake.

true,toodrunktoocare,null,null,"A lot of people saying learn a trade. My opinion, as someone who works alongside the ""trades"", is not to learn a *trade*. Learn a *skill*.

Times are hard in the industry. It suffers badly in hard times like recessions. There's not a huge amount of work out there and there are a whole lot of ""tradesmen"" (most of which aren't tradesmen at all just people who have picked up a bit of know-how and will undercut the competition). Lots of workers, not so much work. So I'd forget about learning a trade to become a carpenter or a bricklayer or the like. It's what everyone gets told when they say ""I want to do something but I don't know what"". There is only as much work as people are willing to pay for.

Better (imho) to learn a skill, or better yet, learn a few of them. Learn to weld or rig or even scuba (obviously that depends where you live). Trawl through evening classes and start taking lessons. Even a foreign language would be good. A skill like welding or a decent amount of french is applicable to a lot more jobs than ""bricklaying"". If you learn skills you can take them anywhere, if you learn a trade that's all you get and you're at the mercy of the market.

true,crepitus,null,null,"If you can do the job, then employers will accommodate you. I became an alcoholic at med school and dropped out after 6 years (resits bumped it up from 5). I then hit the bottle more than ever, nearly ending up dead at 30 (alcoholic hepatitis). I stopped drinking, and spent a year recovering. The anxiety, depression, low self esteem lived on but got easier as I was no longer drinking.

For the next 5-6 years I made a whole bunch of excuses to myself, and repeated them to others - anxiety, depression, alcoholism, lack of experience, no degree, too old, etc. It's all crap. The more you tell yourself these things, the more you'll believe them. And other people *really* love to hear about it...

At 25 you have plenty of time to acquire the skills and experience to do well at any job. Companies are always looking out for people who can speak English, operate a computer, hold up their side of a conversation and not dribble. They take these individuals and train them up. They become very important to the company.

The job I finally got was the first one I actually really wanted, it was the first time I was really applying, and not just fake-applying to keep everyone off my back. In the 7 years since giving up alcohol I had managed to acquire a degree in computer science with the OU (didn't hold much weight with my employers), and write some programs for family and friends (they like these a lot), and hang around in programming forums on the web (ditto - showed interest). I was completely upfront about my past, and why I had a blank CV. I'm stereotypical nerd, socially awkward. I didn't shine in my interview, I sweated a small lake and was very nervous. They didn't mind.

Looking back I should have tried to get a junior position at a small company as soon as possible. Paying my own rent and having something in my wallet would have done wonders for my self-esteem.

true,azorair,null,null,"I would recommend building on whatever you currently know about JavaScript. Learn HTML and CSS too (HTML5+CSS3). Learn it till you drop. And start blogging your learning experience. Start coding up things in your spare time.

Market yourself as a freelancer. Do a bunch of freelance HTML/CSS work. Usually this is like Photoshop PSD to HTML/CSS conversion. Actually getting work can be tricky but if you're well known online it's much easier (hence the blogging). If you blog things people want to learn and tweet things people are interested in you will become well known in the web space.

Then try getting an internship in a city near you. London is ideal. Lots of work to be had there. Try to get an internship in a digital agency (paid, you can get 18k at least). Do it for a few months or even a year. Once you've proven yourself and have experience you will become valuable to the agency. You can continue to work there or move on. We're talking probably between 25k and 30k at this point. Do a helluva lot of work in JavaScript too. Really focus on that (or just pick a technology to specialise on). HTML/CSS/DOM is somewhat basic stuff but you need to know it really well (few people do). Per year of experience we're talking an extra ~5k. 

So, with three years of experience I reckon 35/40k in London is doable. A little lesser in other cities. Keep going, specialising further and further. At this point you could choose JavaScript specialisation, perhaps node.js (that's gonna be big), Backbone... stuff like that. In three years' it's not known what'll be popular. Just make sure you understand the JS language. It isn't going anywhere soon.

Make a name for yourself. Blog. Tweet. Go to conferences and local JS meetups if you want (I never did though).

Secondly, Torres may not have been impressing much these last seasons, but he has shown the longing to play better.

Since he was bought for 50M euros every soccer related media has used every possible chance to bash him, his former manager (AVB) called him a big mistake and his huge price tag just kept hanging over him. I cannot imagine how big of a psychological blow all of this must have been, but recently he has been showing signs of his own self, and his performance at the Euros must surely have been a huge relief for himself, so I think that if there was ever a time to have faith in him, it is now.

Sparkies earn almost as much and the work is a lot cleaner - unless you're rewiring an old house, but it's mostly dust in the eyes rather than anything nastier. Unless there's rats living in the ceiling void, of course. 

Carpentry is the most varied, some dull, some is great, if you get really good at the finish, you can be building bespoke kitchens/bathroom units/staircases/wardrobes etc. That work is genuinely satisfying and creative. At that end of the scale you're on 140-150 a day. Standard work knocking up stud walls or joisting you're earning about 120 a day. 

Also: you have to factor in a) the cost and length of training - for plumbers and sparkies this is measured in years and fuck knows how much money. b) how much equipment you will need. Plumbers and sparkies require a fair bit, several different drills etc, but chippies need the most. To be fully equipped you are talking thousands.

So my top tip: tiling - it's fucking easy if you're not a numpty, and a good tiler can make a grand a week. Find a good tiler by word of mouth, tell him you want to learn and are willing to lift and carry for free for a month or two, and make the tea. You'll learn enough in that time to set up yourself.

What you end up with is a conflict between grading and actual education. Personally I argue that precise grading is actually pretty irrelevant. Employers ignore precise grades in general.

true,tbiz12,null,null,"If you are standing still, you can extend and flex your leg somewhat quickly despite these movements being antagonistic. You will notice a lag time, as at some point the velocity of the leg must be equal to 0 if you are changing from a positive acceleration to a negative acceleration. Still, the lag time is relatively imperceptible while standing still. 

If you are running, there is a lot of force being applied to flexion and extension of the leg muscles to propel the leg forward. Some force must be applied to counteract that if the leg is to suddenly change direction like Suarez's does. Running at a rapid pace means that it is very difficult for Suarez himself to apply that force - how would you forcefully counteract the already forceful muscle contraction that you have initiated WITH THOSE VERY MUSCLES? You can't, it's physiologically impossible. At high speed, it is extremely difficult to rapidly change direction - this phenomenon is visible in many different facets of life, such as driving a car or trying to move laterally while sprinting. 

In the brief (less than half a second) time between Suarez forcefully extending his leg and it snapping back, a counter force could not have been initiated by his own leg muscles - he is simply applying too much force already in the forward direction. O'Shea HAS to have come in contact with his leg for that kind of recoil.

He falls down easy, that is obvious. I'm a fan of playing through contact, and this contact he could have played through - he probably would've just stumbled a bit but retained his center of gravity. Regardless, all of the biomechanical considerations point to Suarez making contact with O'Shea's leg to some extent. 

You can disagree on whether a penalty should be given due to minimal contact and you can argue about whether it's sporting play or not.

When I see people do rubbish work but still get paid I've seen that you can demand more for just being the person that goes the extra mile and wants to do the best job.

true,marley88,english,England,"Yahoo answers has an interesting contribution:

&gt; There wouldn't necessarily be any obligation to change the flag. A flag is a flag, just that, there are no rules over what you can or can't put on it. It doesn't have to be accurate, it's just a few nice colours on a piece of fabric which mean something, but don't have to mean anything. For example, the EU flag has 15 stars on it, even though it now has 27 members, but rather than keep changing it whenever any new country joins, they've just kept it as it's more simple logistically. The same could happen with the Union Jack.

&gt;The Welsh flag is not on it purely for pictorial reasons because it would be difficult to fit it into a flag full of different crosses, even though I think it's by far the nicest flag of the 4 parts in the UK. Wales is just as much a part of the Union as any of the other 3 parts though, it's only because someone on Microsoft Publisher couldn't find a way of moving a dragon onto a very mathematical looking Union Jack.

&gt; So the Saltire could be taken out but it could be left in, it doesn't mean anything, flags aren't that important, they just looks nice, doesn't matter what the colours represent.

My biggest problem with what you're saying is that you are consistently stating that her character should be bisexual/gay and not just say she was going through a phase. While I see what you are trying to say, I feel your sentiment is trivializing the people who identify as straight now but have had gay/bi experiences before and moved away from it for one reason or another (eg- a phase). 

Trivializing ANY part of the sexuality spectrum trivializes us all. Its still a battle for acceptance out there, and we need all the allies we can get. 

Sure, bisexuality could use some more good press (bisexual erasure is an issue I am pretty familiar with), but the fact that this show is wiling to stray outside the traditional M-F lines at all should be celebrated and encouraged so that they keep doing it, not belittled for not going far enough. There are still far too many people who shy away from portraying any kind of non-hetero parts of the rainbow and while we can wish/hope for more all day long (come back to us, Captain Jack!!), we need to appreciate that it's a process and even baby steps are still steps.

true,myimportantthoughts,cnty-uk,It's grim up North London,"For starter, how would we even define intelligence? I personally do not believe we are even close to devising an 'intelligence' test of any use ie. one that would consistently enable scientists to predict who has a significantly better mental ability (in any field) compared to their peers. And are there not many different types of intelligence? Is JK Rowling (harry potter author) intelligent? And if she is, how would you compare her intellect with say, Phil Ivey, one of the world's greatest poker players. Or Warren Buffet, stock market genius. Or Damien Hirst, the artist. Do you see what I mean? Put them at a card table, and Ivey would seem a genius, the others ordinary. Yet if you asked them to complete an 'intelligence' test, they might all seem average (or above or below). 

Clearly, school/academic performance has nothing to do with worldly success, if someone like Richard Branson (in my opinion at least of above average intelligence) can be insanely successful but do poorly in school then our current exam system obviously does not seem measure intelligence very well.

Also, any test that one can practice at and improve at would seem useless. If I spend 4 hours practicing IQ tests (I haven't done this but you know what I mean) and increased my score by 8 points have I really become more intelligent over the course of an afternoon? This seems unlikely, I have simply become better at taking the test.

To return to OP's question, no I would not support it. I believe that we are at least 200 years away from any sort of sophisticated 'intelligence' testing and if we could create such a test I suspect that it would be long and extremely complicated, giving all sorts of readings for emotional intelligence , logic , numerical reasoning, spatial reasoning etc etc. The sort of test I envisage would include DNA sampling and probably 100+ hours of written tests, physical challenges, speaking challenges and situational decision making.",0,1347915204,null,0,false,0,c69ke9o,t3_101eu9,t1_c69ke9o,t3_101eu9,null,1429923147,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

true,[deleted],null,null,"Not a problem Batman. I actually started out by applying to work in a call centre working as a customer service agent on behalf of Vodafone UK. There were no sales required at this stage but I needed my 'Foundation Level' so to speak to build my confidence as I was a closed up nervous wreck. Working shitty shifts and speaking to ignorant customers. The break in for me was on my own initiative to 'sell' products whilst on these account queries. Voicemail for example, it was free for customers and those who didn't have it, I 'sold' them it for free. Might not be a sale so to speak, but it helped my confidence in approaching people to take a service they never had. Small steps, etc. I then took this opportunity to properly sell, like upsell price plans and additional services. It wasn't asked of me but hey, I wanted to learn and wanted to stand out like a sore thumb. I then went on to apply for another job in another call centre, this time making outbound sales calls on behalf of o2. This give me more experience, this time in cold calling. Bullshit idiots again and full of ignorant folk but it is all persistence. Both jobs paid no more than £6 an hour and really, any idiot could walk into them. These call centres are paid by call rates and what not, so they want bums on seats. I took this will to learn and developed my own sales methods and skills. Truth be told, don't be a fucking salesman... Be yourself! Everyone sees through bullshit! I grew a set of balls and applied for a job that was out of my league but went in guns blazin'. Key notes whilst applying for sales jobs. Be bubbly, happy and confident. Also, know your shit. Do plenty of research on the company your applying to. Pick up on their finest little details, not just the obvious things. I applied to work for a top regional newspaper in their advertising sales and marketing department, cold calling companies to advertise their business and market their products. I took the confidence approach, knew my shit, gave my ideas and they hired me. This was a newspaper but I came in with ideas of issuing free magazines within the papers, advertising magazines. Asked why, I answered ""The distribution costs are covered already by the paper and printing costs are low, on a 24 page magazine I could easily make £20k profit."" They were amazed that an industry that I had never worked in, I knew so much about. Just by research. They hired me and I made a hell of a name for myself by sticking to my word and making plenty of revenue. I am with a different print publication now and again it's all about thinking big, thinking outside the box and giving input. I started with these guys 3 months ago, week trial, no wage, just 10% commission on what I sold. Took the guy for £800 for 3 days work, and he hired me. When I started they offered a single print service. Since then I have helped introduce a text message service, online service, QR codes for each advertiser and social media. I plan to stick with them until January and go it on my own. Realistically, free publications and online are the way forward. Magazine and newspaper circulations are drastically dropping with the digital age. Profit margins can be huge if thought through properly. I have been head hunted a thousand times now and turn them all down.

Advice: Be confident, don't be afraid to start with a shit low paid call centre job, know your shit and do your research, stand out from the crowd, do more than what is expected from you, think of ideas that will earn the business more but also earn you more. Most importantly, wake in the morning wanting to go to work, not having to.

What really to expect (The worst): Ignorant fucking customers, people hanging up on you, asshole managers, being worked like a horse, really competitive colleagues, mood swings, stress when sales aren't flying in, becoming quite manipulative and nightmare deadlines.

Put up with this shit for a while and you'll be flying. With hard work and the will to learn, this can easily be done in 18 months.

Best line in sales: Always offer the product for more than it is worth. If the product costs £200, ask for £400. Let the bastards haggle with you. Let them talk you down to £200. Let them think they came out the winner of the sale, hang up the phone and sit there like a smug bastard with your full price / non discounted sale.

Any other questions, certainly feel free to send a message my way. I really love to see people come from nothing, make it big and appreciate that it started with nothing. P.S.

You've definitely hit the nail on the head with not being afraid to start from the bottom. It struck me as quite a blow when I'd really not considered my career past the end of graduation, and somehow harboured these thoughts that I would just land something when I leave. I've always been kind of lucky, I suppose I pick up on opportunities really quickly and if I'm honest, I've never felt like I have to work hard to be noticed, both in education and the workplace. I realise now that graduate or not, I'm going to be on minimum wage for a while. 

What worried me most is that I had this great career plan, and now that it turns out it's not really viable- do I stick with it and badger on at the companies I want to work for, or do I do a low-paying job first and try and work up. I felt like Marketing was already a side-step from my chosen career (Design Research), and was worried that Sales was another step too far, but it helps to speak to someone like you who has walked the path ahead of me, so I thank you, genuinely.

true,nonresponsive,null,null,"I was in a similar boat, where I was watching episode by episode and loving it. Then hit series 5 and felt like something had changed. I stuck with it because people from this subreddit told me that it does get better, and it's true that I definitely enjoyed some of the episodes. Series 6 picked up, and I thought it was definitely more enjoyable, with it answering a lot of questions that were littered throughout the show. And Series 7 has been pretty fun, tho I am looking for a bit of change, because it feels like it's in a routine atm.

I know based on what people say that Matt Smith's Doctor is the most accurate in it's current incarnation, but in all honesty I loved ninth and tenth doctor. I loved them because everything wasn't white and black, there was a lot of grey. I'm rewatching them, and right away in the second episode of Series 1, Eccleston watches as Cassandra dies, Rose tells him to save her, but the Doctor just goes something like, ""All things have their time"". 

I just feel like lately Matt Smith tries to save everyone, and everything gets wrapped up neatly with few casualties. I mean, in episode 2 of Series 1 alone, a lot of people die. I get sad when I saw the tree lady burn up. People's lives felt like they had weight. And the Doctor wasn't this perfect guy, he was ""human"". He had emotions and burdens. I loved the grittiness. Sure he wanted to save everyone, but things didn't always work out that way.

But now, it just feels very black and white. And to me it's a slap in the face when shit happens, and then everything magically goes back to the way things were, because it makes things not matter. I mean yes, Series 3 does this, but it was the only time. Now it seems like I'm expecting it to happen which is terrible. Because it honestly makes lives not have value because everything can just be reset, which is silly. Series 1/2/4 ended with them all not wrapping everything up nicely, but having real consequences. Rose gets trapped in another universe. Donna loses her memory. So many died in Series 1. I can even vividly remember the lady in Series 1 screaming, ""YOU TRICKED ME"", as she died to the Daleks. Yes, Captain Jack comes back but that's it. 

I feel like no one important has died or been hurt permanently in a long time, so it feels very cheap to me. The Doctor will always come through, and I hate it. Maybe it's not like the original series, but what's wrong with the show changing? I just miss the gravity of the situations in past episodes. I haven't felt similar tension in Series 5+. I'm not looking for good guys and bad guys, with the good guys always winning. I'm looking for good guys being bad guys, and bad guys being good guys, and sometimes there are no victories. 

Maybe I'm over-romanticizing some episodes, but honestly, I just remember thinking, a lot of people died when watching through the first 4 series, and I can't think of that many in more recent episodes, aside from the occasional bad guy.",0,1347919451,null,0,false,0,c69lj59,t3_101cf6,t1_c69lj59,t3_101cf6,null,1429923683,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The other thing would be to introduce chance.

One vote is pulled out to decide the winner. It means that you can never bankroll a candidate to certain victory, which is one way of getting money out of politics.

true,LedgeySC,cnty-uk,Manchester,"I spent my second year of my Politics and IR course in the Czech Republic, at Anglo-American University. My first impressions of the place were how pretty it was. I was studying in an old building which doubled as an embassy for the Knights of St John which had the famous [Lennon Wall](http://www.prague-information.eu/dsgn/old_img/Pics/johnlennonwal.JPG) on the side of it. The whole place was beautiful though and it just generally felt nice to be living there.

I tried to learn bits of Czech there but I didn't stay long enough to be able to use it effectively. There weren't many English speakers and sometimes it was difficult but it was kinda entertaining trying to get through a conversation with little bits of Czech and hand gestures (mainly ""Nemluvim Cesky, Anglicky?""). Interestingly I probably met more Dutch and American people there than I did Czechs!

There are many things I miss but the two biggest are public transport and beer. For students, public transport costs around £30 for three months and includes unlimited transport on buses, trams and the metro. Whilst I never went on the buses, the trams and metro were incredibly efficient and ran 24/7 (well, the metro shuts for a few hours in the morning I think). The beer was amazing, so much to choose from and incredibly cheap (around £1.20 for 0.5l in Prague, cheaper outside). There's not much crime there except for pickpockets, which I didn't experience. I lived in a rather expensive place (at about £800pm between two of us) but in all honesty, it was because we'd had issues with the original company we were dealing with. Most people I spoke to were staying in apartments at £200pm. 

But yeah my plan is to eventually get back there, be it a short term stay or actually getting to live there. I have few regrets but I regret not finding a cheaper place to live and not being able to travel much outside of the Czech Republic. I visited a few castles and places like Cesky Krumlov which were nice trips and gave us plenty to do. 

If you're looking for a place to go, certainly look into Prague or anywhere in the Czech Republic (I had a friend who went to Brno and enjoyed it immensely). ",0,1347924055,null,0,false,0,c69mqif,t3_101evf,t1_c69mqif,t3_101evf,null,1429924321,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The key is to identify what you want, then plan the steps (qualifications you need, places to work, relevant experience and so on) from where you are to where you want to be, then follow the steps. A careers office can help you with this. The advantage of this approach is that you can gun for what you actually want to do. The problem is that you need to make sure it is something you can reach, and the road is likely to hard.

Alternatively identify a skill or talent you have that could make money, and then build an education and experience base around it, then see where you go. Do you have any special in depth knowledge? It doesn't even need to be professional, it can just be knowing a shit load about a certain sport. The advantage of this is that with some luck you can land a relevant job pretty quickly. The disadvantage is you may end up turning a hobby into a job, and you may not get 'as high' as with the previous approach.

A degree isn't what it used to be, not unless you're looking to get into high academia. A CV with lots of relevant stuff pointing at the job you want is far more likely to land you the place. 

Finally discuss this with your partner. See what they have to say, see if they have any suggestions on directions you can take or skills you can build on. They even be able to help support you. It's 2012, just because you're a guy doesn't mean you need to always be a breadwinner.

I always thought part of the charm of Doctor Who, especially in Old Who, but also in the 9 and 10 days to an extent, was that it was a little campy and a little low-budget-looking, but they made up for it with excellent writing and complex stories. It almost seems that now that formula has been turned on end a little. I think that perhaps with its recent growth in popularity and the attention it's been given, it's maybe losing its way a little.

true,Spartan144,smith,Smith,"I started watching Doctor Who mid way through series 5. I was bored out of my mind one day and I started channel surfing. It is kinda funny, the title of all things is what drew me in. While I was looking at all the channels the title ""Doctor Who"" just had a weird symmetry that compelled me to click on it. The episode was ""Cold Blood."" My first impression was this must be some cheesy horror film. Bad reptile costumes (Silurians) and a hot chick screaming out of her mind (Amy). Anyways I continued watching and got through the episode. Its was a decent first episode. I became really intrigued when I realized it was a time-travel show because they kept showing previews for next weeks episode (Vincent and the Doctor) during the commercial breaks. 

Like I said I was bored out of my mind so I decided to go back and start the season off right. I bought the first 8 episodes of the series and caught myself up. I was hooked. Anytime a Doctor Who rerun was on BBC America I would watch it, and have been watching every new episode since then. BBC America also started running Torchwood reruns and I fell in love with that too. 

Just a couple days ago I decided I need MORE! So I am now powering through the first 4 series to complete the gap in my Doctor Who experience. I just finished the first series and I can say without a doubt I have never cried so much in a 24 hour period.

I know a fair few people who did do an MSc, there's a few things you could look in to. First up, a lot of banks offer professional development loans, which while you do have to pay back, will give you enough to pay fees and living costs for a year. You do have to convince the bank that you will benefit from doing the MSc and stuff though. the government does one too [some info here](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/AdultLearning/FinancialHelpForAdultLearners/CareerDevelopmentLoans/DG_10033237)

There are *tons* of scholarships and grants from various trusts, especially if you're a minority of some kind [women's grants here](http://www.theukrc.org/women/grants-and-bursaries), worth clicking through even if you're not female, some of those organisations do not-just-for-ladies grants too.

You could try approaching businesses/organisations in your field, some of the nature trusts maybe? they might sponsor you through on the condition of you working X hours a week, or X months after you graduate.

Ask your university and the careers advisers, they'll know of any uni-specific schemes to help students pay for masters degrees, like scholarships or grants from funds left by rich alumni. You'll probably need to get a crazy high grade in your undergrad to qualify though.

Other than that, take a gap year to earn/save, get credit cards and part time jobs while you study. I know lots of masters students that scraped through their year on a few thousand saved in a gap year, plus working part time in bars. Most masters courses are somewhat more flexible than undergrad courses, as there's less lecture time and more time working on your own projects. Though if you have lots of field work, this might be harder...

Definitely don't rule out the part time option. If you can find a company to do it in, you'll make better/more contacts in the industry and have more relevant experience on your CV than if you go straight through uni (not something to sniff at, given the economy and the job market being somewhat shite for a lot of sectors at the moment). A lot of businesses have continual professional improvement schemes so getting on to a P/T masters might be easier than you'd think.

* Our finishing WBA was atrocious, him included. They won with a goal against the run of play, but he played alright.
* Didn't play against Norwich.
* We lost to Fulham, he had 1 shot on target. He wasn't bad but wasn't great.
* He almost single-handedly brought us back against Chelsea in the FA Final, after being subbed on. Scored a goal and almost a second.
* He again had a good game against Chelsea the next week.
* Against Swansea he didn't really do too much outside of his bicycle kick IMO.

Carroll really is underrated with the ball at his feet, I'll give you that, but his vision and passing could improve some. But the big reason why Carroll isn't a part of Rodgers' plan is his movement, he's way too stagnant. He either drops deep to show or expects a ball/cross to to the back post for him to challenge for in the air. Also Carroll creates an easy out for others, they can just launch it up to him, and that is something Rodgers' doesn't want. Even if you train them not to, their first reaction when pressured could be to launch it up to Carroll(it happened a lot last year). 

If you look at someone like Llorente, who we're rumored to be interested in(*please* *please*), his movement is spectacular for his size. Llorente shows, makes back shoulder runs, makes runs to create space for his charging teammates, and most importantly makes intelligent runs inside the box. He's also very skillful at keeping possession.

Carroll maybe could get to Llorente's level one day, but I don't think Rodgers wanted to take the time/effort to develop those talents. Ultimately I think he wanted a clean slate, without the price tag looming over his and Carroll's heads, and the unwanted press that an out of form/not playing Carroll creates.

true,photometric,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"As a kid in the 80's I was both fascinated and terrified by Doctor Who (4th &amp; 5th) so I would stand at the TV with my hand on the dial (this was before tv remotes were common) and turn to the channel for just long enough to not be scared and then quickly turn it away when I couldn't take it anymore. Ther was something magic about the ""real"" sets, monsters and feel of the show, not to mention the amazing music and sounds, that seared it into my memories. For those who complain that the show isn't dark and scary enough, it really helps to be a 8 year old. 

Eventually the show declined and I grew out of it but I always remembered it fondly. Years later in the early days of digital cable, I found that BBC-Kids was airing those classic episodes so I started taping them and rewatching them. It was part nostalgia and part respect for the low-budget, high-concept qualities of the show and I fell in love with it again. Finally the new series started up and the rest is history. 

For those of you who are down on the direction it is going, I recommend taking a longer view of the show. It is an open ended show after all and the Doctor will continue to change. Try watching again down the road when a new companion is introduced or even a new Doctor. Don't be so concerned with continuity and current story arcs. Think about the *spirit* of the show and the ongoing adventure. Take a break but always remember the sound of the TARDIS tearing apart time and space as it rematerializes. It will be waiting for you.

true,Kandoh,tardis,TARDIS,"Back in 2005 on the CBC. 

I was about 15, living a comfortable life as a nerd with a tragic past he was running away from. I delighted in shrugging off what was normal and expected. 

Had heard about Doctor Who as this old, cheesy, British show with cheap monsters. Sounded fun to watch ironically.

Was not disappointed by the cheesiness of the first episode Rose. Killer Mannequins? CGI Ooze monster? Fantastic!

But there was something else, I didn't even notice it at first...

The Doctor... who the hell was he? Why was he so sad? Why was he so silly? He reminded me a lot of myself... Very sad, very angry, but always telling a stupid joke and not taking anyone seriously.

Arrogant as this sounds I sort of saw him as me... Always knew the answer to everything, telling people what was best, and always *right* in the end. Yeah, that sounds like me as a teenager.

We were both running away from something that kept coming back to haunt us. For him it was war, genocide, the death of his entire race. For me it was losing my mother to cancer and watching my family falling apart. Art is life rite large as they say.

I never showed my pain, none of my friends suspected anything. My ""therapy"" was watching the Doctor get better. I watched him deal with his own guilt, watched him learn to be happy, fall in love, let go, get hurt again, and get right back up again.

This silly, cheesy show had somehow become this journey through personal grief for me. It was like a Trojan horse of therapy.  

I probably wouldn't be nearly as healthy or emotionally stable as I am today if it wasn't for Doctor Who.

Anyway, she's a smart woman and enjoys reading and audiobooks and occasionally she'll drop some knowledge on me on things I should see or read or listen to. She thought DW would appeal to me for its ""sci-fi"" nature -- something I thought was on the silly side because I've never considered myself a sci-fi guy (especially when the channel representing it is full of cheesy schlock).

Nevertheless she's a good friend with good taste and knows me pretty well, so I flicked through some videos, especially after she charmed me by telling me I resembled Tennant and that that was a good thing. It seemed like I would be getting myself into something TERRIBLY cheesy but I caught elements of story from the outside that seemed really cool.

Long story short, my other friend let me borrow her Netflix to sample it, and on the first friend's recommendation I started with Christmas invasion and spent a disturbing amount of my free time for a month and a half burning through all the episodes except for the last two Christmas specials (one because it wasn't on Netflix yet and the other because I didn't know it existed).

Then I caught the first Eccleston episode and cherry-picked highly-rated ones (by sheer coincidence, when I visited that friend again we were going to watch an ep on demand but it was the farting-aliens one and seemed really weak, hence the urge to skip some).

true,Quaquaversal,mcgann,McGann,"The Doctor's been keeping me alive. Three years ago I was diagnosed with some crummy forever illness that cost me my job and pretty much eliminated future job prospects, then followed up the darkest series of yada yada melodrama coming from all directions (family, money, friends, stalker, etc., etc.) I've ever experienced in my life. I got into that state of mind where everything is so bad you look for more things to punish yourself with just so you have *some* kind of control over the awful in your life. For most people that would be getting super drunk on cheap rum or driving recklessly across country in a stolen car or self-cutting, but the first option is out as it could kill me, and I don't actually want to find out what it's like to go to jail. 

So, while scanning Netflix for the worst shows imaginable to inflict on my mind, I saw the first series of new Doctor Who was available. To this day I have no idea why I automatically decided a British show about a time travelling space alien wearing a leather jacket and giving himself the unsuper-hero-y moniker of ""Doctor"" would be terrible. But in a backwards kind of way, I am glad and incredibly lucky to have been that stupid (and jerk-y). From the first ""Nice to meet you, Rose. Run for your life!"" I was *hooked*. It was brilliant, awesome, beautiful! I spent the whole hour completely absorbed, and for the first time in months I forgot my life was basically over. I watched every new Who episode available (at the time, classic Who wasn't offered on streaming), went back and watched more, and slowly but surely, over the months I began to feel incrementally better.

Doctor Who isn't just a grand space-time travelling adventure series. It's a show about someone who, no matter what's going on, will always try to do the right thing for everyone, just because that's what he's decided to do. He secretly believes himself to be monstrous, he's wiped out a planet (to save everyone else in the entire freaking world, but that part seems to count for zero in his image of himself), so you know he's got the worst personal demons in the history of ever, *and* he's constantly getting killed, or threatened with death, or being fought by the very people he's trying to help, or watching them die horribly, and he still just won't give up. Best example in the world to live by.

The never stop trying to do good part, I mean, not the running off getting killed for everybody's benefit business.

So, anyways, the Doctor showed me that no matter how bad things are, you can choose how you deal. Your life and everything in it might be utter crap, but you can decide to be awesome anyways. Also to do good and help people, and have fun, and that the best way to get impossible, ridiculous things done is to embrace the ridiculous and ignore the impossible part :P

Never ever ever ever give up.  Tomorrow's another day, there are good things to be had, good things to do, beautiful things to see, quirky jokes to tell, and there is always the possibility of random awesome everywhere.

And right about the time I finished up series 4, I stumbled across redditgifts and reddit. Perfect timing, as anonymously sending strangers stuff they might like almost completely out of the blue is the kind of thing I'd been wanting to do since the Doctor came into my life.


TL;DR: Doctor Who is awesome; the show's saved my life and made it brighter (I guess it's strange to latch onto a show for that kind of thing, but I'll take oddities that work over philosophies that don't, anytime); through the show I went looking for things to do that would be cool, and found redditgifts and reddit.

true,Inner_Pickle,null,null,"I went to 'Murica almost four years ago to study theatre and witness the whole Obama election thing. I already had contacts over at the uni in Baltimore and really wanted to just experience the USA for myself. Here's what I learned; 

- The USA is not too dissimilar to the UK really in many respects, mainly as we get a lot of American culture force fed to us on a daily basis but there are notable differences all 'round. The main thing I discovered while out there is Americans and Brits treat social situations and meeting new people differently. Us Brits seem to be a nation of introverts who take a while to warm to new people and let our guard down where as the Americans seem to be the direct opposite; Extroverts who greet everyone with a smile and the kind of over friendliness that us Brits seem to distrust immediately. It makes them hard to read sometimes and their actual intentions can be obscured behind several years of intensive dentistry. This being said, however, most Americans are honest, genuine people and some of the best people I've ever met but there are were times when I questioned the sincerity of our relationship.
- The language is the same but vastly different. Not just in a 'sidewalk', 'elevator' way but the way they used the language was different. Its hard to explain as I settled into the culture but the first few weeks were occasionally frustrating from a language perspective.
- They treat $10 the same way we treat £10, in that you'd get roughly the same amount of pick'n'mix both sides of the pond. At least when I was there anyway.
- American Universities are pretty hardcore during term time. The biggest thing that got to me was there are no mid-term breaks, no occasional weeks off or bank holidays just study. All day, every day. Even weekends were intensive as that was the time to do the homework for all your various classes (I took seven) and they gave you the fucking stuff daily. I didn't even really get much time to explore the USA, something I sort of regret as I was stuck in my room for the whole six months studying. And I was doing a theatre course. That was hard. Especially as I was conditioned to having a break six weeks into a course and my body went weird around the eight week mark.
- Americans **love** the British. I would recommend going there for this single fact alone. As well as Cheerleaders suddenly taking an interest in me I got discounts and free stuff just for being, well, me.

I've bullet pointed enough but you get the gist. I really enjoyed my time there and I intend to go back at some point. I'd recommend it as a place to study if you can handle the workload, I mean who goes to uni to vomit on a bar floor everyweek anyway?! Ahem.

true,ibpants,1972crest,,"What FuckThe said.  We aim to play a pretty fluid and narrow possession game for the most part (it's a quick passing game rather than the slow, laborious metronome that you'll be familiar with from your Classicos) with the full backs looking to exploit space that opens up down the flanks.

We are quick on the counter attack but that's not our main approach - we ordinarily aim to control the pace of the game.  From what I've seen of you guys I think we need to be a little bit cautious about our usual approach, because it can leave us very exposed in the event of us making a misplaced pass, and your guys seem to be comfortable playing patiently and waiting for opportunities to counter.  

With any luck we'll have Yaya, Barry, Silva, and Nasri in the midfield with possibly Tevez dropping deep, so those stray passes should be few and far between.

If City are looking for a goal midway through the second half, expect to see Nasri or Silva come off for a defensive midfielder (Javi Garcia, or Rodwell), you may find it a little confusing, but keep your eyes on Yaya (and hope your players do the same).",0,1347944688,null,0,false,0,c69s5tz,t3_102a5w,t1_c69s5tz,t3_102a5w,null,1429926878,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

Spurs are a realistic threat. Fackin' Spurs.

He'll play; Bilbao's squad isn't big enough for him not to, and I'd say last season was an overachievement for them under Bielsa; I don't see it happening this season, which means that a lack of results may mean Llorente has to be used even if he's going to be leaving.

true,sirbruce,null,null,"&gt; If you can't self-identify a list of words that you shouldn't use in civilized company

I can.  In my civilized company, which includes the transgendered, the word when not used as a slur, such as it was used here, is perfectly acceptable.  What is not acceptable in civilized company is censorship and self-appointed arbiters of good taste.  You would be tossed out on your ear.

&gt; Racial, gender role and sexual identity/orientation slurs. It's a pretty easy category of words not to use.

The bot clearly has a category of words, so the fact you refuse to provide it only shows how empty your position is.

&gt; A public place doesn't need to post a list of things that are going to have you removed.

But this place certainly needs a list of words that are banned, since you are actively removed people based solely on the list of *words*, not on the list of *things*.  See, I tried to explain to you that I didn't do the ""thing"" you claimed, which was intentionally insult anyone, and you said it didn't matter what the intent was; the *word* was all that mattered.

&gt; If you think they do, I suggest that you stand in the middle of your local mall food court and recount a list of slurs to the crowd, then argue with security about how they can't kick you out because the list of offensive behaviors wasn't posted at each entrance.

I did this and was not removed because we have free speech in this country and it did not cause a disturbance.  Furthermore, the mall did not have a list of automatically banned words; instead they factored in the person's intent.  So... now what?  I guess you'll agree you were wrong and change your position?

&gt; You don't pay much attention, then, as it's been actively performing moderating for three months now.

Doctor Who hasn't gotten much attention since there haven't been new episodes during most of that time.

Edit: [Here's a thread from a month ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/xpt7q/we_had_a_costume_day_at_work_so_i_decided_to_make/c5otmzt) where the word ""wh*re"" -- a slur if I've ever heard one -- is used not once, but twice!  And there's no censorship of it.

Eleven seems MUCH more sensitive to loss than Ten was initially, and the torturedness that went along with Ten blaming himself for the loss of (essentially) two companions is seeming to carry over into Eleven's neediness for the Ponds.

Have you ever fallen into a place where you question how differently things would go over with different regenerations in place of an existing one?

As an example, for me, it's bizarre enough that a 900+ year old guy is being kissed by an *actually* young woman -- not that he didn't try to both inform her and stop her initially. 

But physically Matt Smith as 11 looks close *enough* that it's more permissible to my mind than, say, imagining David Tennant's 10th Doctor kissing her. All of the sudden my mind would go ""Creepy old guy hitting on the little girl!"" Yeah, he hung around Rose, who was supposed to be really young (ha), but to me he felt really at home around Catherine Tate, seeming more of a peer and even at times authoritative and more mature and mentor-y despite her (the actress) being almost three years older.

Seriously, it's fascinating to me. Take almost any 11 episode and pretend 10 is in his place, and it just doesn't connect. It doesn't work. I can't see him doing it. I can't say, ""If 10 was here, this is how he would broach the topic of reconciliation with the Silurians!""

And yet, they have the same memories and the same stories, and at the deepest level they act and react in a lot of the same ways.

It's amazing what the surface gloss can do. 10 was very stand-there and posey to me, so when he acted goofy, I paid attention. 11 has arms that look like they're being manipulated by someone behind him a la Whose Line Is It Anyway, but when he stops moving and gives a scowl, people crap their pants.

Same guy. Kudos to them all for pulling it off like they do. When you think about how young the more modern Doctors look and that it was supposed to be them saying and doing those things as William Hartnell's first Doctor, it's a chasm. That's why I like lines like from that Children in Need special where he intimates that being old and grumpy was a put-on because he felt that's how you act until you actually genuinely mature.

I didn't experience any particular culture shocks, but then I was already fairly familiar with German culture due to family connections. The University was much larger than my home University, so at times it felt a bit like a huge factory - especially when using the catering facilities. For me, the biggest challenge was the bureaucracy - initially at first getting my visa, accommodation and bank account sorted. It was classic case of each of those tasks depended on both of the others being complete, so I ended up going round in circles for a while!

German lectures are loooong though, and they like to start early. A two hour stint starting at eight in the morning was normal, and quite a shock from the laissez faire attitude at most UK Universities.

I'd definitely do it again - I keep pondering about working in Berlin for a while. If you have the opportunity to do something like this, I'd definitely say go for it - its a great experience. I don't have any useful resources - everything I have is so old that its of no practical use.

true,Viae,uk,Warwickshire,"I guess I'm fine with it as for political purposes, there is pretty much free speech. The amount of handwringing that occurred over Nick Griffin (a far-right politician who had some pretty distasteful views on the holocaust in the eighties) over whether or not he should be given a platform on the BBC (never mind being censored) was colossal.

Basically, there's a programme on the BBC called Question Time, where members of the public ask a broadly representative panel of politicians and activists questions about the issues of the day. The BBC, despite its fairly liberal (different to left-wing, subtly) identity decided of its own accord it had to let Griffin on this programme, though only after a whole week of argument and back-and-forth in the papers and in other sections of the media. Again, that wasn't over censorship, that was over whether there was a duty to provide a platform for the views of a fairly small proportion of the population. 

The nature of the laws are quite interesting as well. Griffin has been convicted of incitement of racial hatred in the past, not because he is a racist (that's not illegal) but because he tried to convince other people to be racist too, in public. I'm fine with that argument not being made in public, personally.

AM is kinda obvious, Gerrard's been notorious for the past couple of seasons of getting groin injuries and so forth. The other reality is as he is a skilled guy at the set piece game, he hasn't been in his trademark deadly form in quite a bit,if he got his groove back I'd be a happy camper.

Only once have I been so distracted by others that I felt a need to do anything about it. Some kids in a back corner of the cinema were running around, talking loudly, playing with their phone lights etc. during the first 15 minutes of the film with no sign of stopping. Rather than piss about asking them to stop, I ducked out of the cinema and found a ticket taker outside - told her about it - and she turned to a bank of CCTV cameras beside her. A little panning around with the night-vision cameras and she had found the kids (easily illuminated by the cameras and their phone screens as they moved about). 

She told me not to worry and it would be taken care of. I went back to my seat and five minutes later three security guys entered via the back door to the cinema and escorted the whole lot of them out of the screening - no questions asked. 

Felt good.

Every student in Australia who completes year 12 gets a ranking out of 100.

Universities set a cut-off for each course on the same scale.

That's it. Really easy, works well.

e.g. if you get a rank of 90.00, it means you're in the top 10% of the students who graduated that year. Plain and simple.

Courses like medicine/law usually require around the 99% mark, engineering is usually around 80% to 90%, and so on.

When I've set work for Chinese students to do in China the local lecturers have changed the assignment to be incredible simple for example from a critical evaluation task to just installing a piece of software. 

Other student cohorts seems to bland in fairly well with the local students. Although I only have experience of EU, Pakistani, Indian and Chinese students.

true,[deleted],null,null,"What I'm finding is a lot of people seem to conflate different things that seem similar but are in fact quite different.

One is freedom of speech vs freedom from consequences. Next is opinion vs insults/abuse. And finally there's legislation for something vs not legislating for something else.

I can say what I want. No one can physically stop me. What I can't do is expect to not be criticised, expect to be listened to or agreed with, and to be able to be heard in and on any venue I choose without first owning that venue myself.

What some people want is the ability to express their views and opinions without then facing the sack from their job. Your employer isn't going to stop you having your opinion...keep having them, but they do have the right to tell you you're no longer employed. You have no right to any given job. You have no right to have your neighbours like you or for any business to serve you. People realise that to carry on the lives they lead they may have to keep certain opinions to themselves. They mistake this choice to not express their views as someone *stopping* them from expressing said views. No one is stopping you, you've chosen the easy way out. You've chosen your cushy life over your own convictions.

I have no right to be heard or seen on a privately owned forum or on private property. You see people make this mistake when a comment or post is removed for whatever reason here on Reddit. You don't own Reddit and it's not publicly held...it's a private venture owned by a corporation and they can delete your posts or even your account whenever they want, US citizen or not.

US freedom of speech is there to stop the **Government** from snatching away your newspaper or arresting you for saying you oppose them on the radio. It isn't there to protect the guy saying nigger in the Youtube comments. You've simply just not got hate speech legislation like some other countries. That's not the same as that speech being protected by your freedom speech laws. Too many Americans assume that because they can run down the street screaming ""Go home wet-backs"" it's all due to the freedom of speech laws that *do* exists rather than hate speech laws that *don't*.

That misconception is why you're in here assuming a position of superiority when you see some Twitter troll get picked up.

I can't say ""cunt"" on US daytime TV. No manner of freedom of speech will protect that. There *are* laws against it.

So this was Christmas, and I had incentive targets.  The busiest time of day was obviously lunchtime.  When was I forced (I couldn't not take it) to take my break?  12-1pm or 1-2pm.  And what did I have to do in the other hour?  Work the till while others took their breaks, rather than man my stand. I would see so many people coming over and peering at the products (it was quite new and cool) and I wasn't allowed to go over and assist them.

I never made my incentives.  I got with a few quid of the targets on so may days, but I needed that peak to pip it over.

Way I see it, the Silence story has not been resolved. At all.

I found it to be too much of a coincidence.

Also, ""Who is the Doctor?"" (not just his name, obviously) is a very interesting question which could truly lead to some disastrous revelations or events and which could be approached from various angles.

Anyway, as for your original question, ""Silence will fall (when the question is asked)"" was the motif all through season 5 and 6. This never happened and was never tackled.

One example I would like to give is Fulham in 2010 when they reached the final. We all know Fulham are a good team and had they won, I think we can all agree that would have been a great accomplishment for them but are they now good enough to be Champions League because of that win? I don't think they are, I'd rather see them earn top four to have the privilege.

This isn't for universities. This is for postgraduate education, which leads to academia. Female representation in the majority of STEM academia is absolutely *atrocious*. In my undergrad at physics there were *two* female members of staff above postgrad level compared to perhaps 50+ male. In my postgrad in engineering, some of the fields have no female staff whatsoever. I don't think any of them have more than 1.

I am feeling petty, so let's look at some of what this guy says:

&gt;I can’t think of any other fandom that assumes they have a canon when nobody has ever told them that they do.  

He uses Christianity and the council of bishops as an example - nobody told the 'high clerics' there had to be a canon.

&gt;Especially since our show itself declares that it doesn’t now have, and probably never did have, a canon.  

I don't understand what this means. Does he mean some of the *Doctor Who* writers declare this?  

&gt;You know, if you’re a Star Trek fan, that the animated series, in a hugely unfair way, considering some of the stuff that did get in, is definitively uncanonical. In these cases, ‘canon’ is not only about authority, but an authority exists that is interested in legislating about it.  

No, the Star Trek animated series is considered canon, but the canon itself is not fixed. (As we know anyway the recent film contradicts Mr Spock's established life-story) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_canon  

&gt;Nobody at the BBC has ever uttered a pronouncement about what is and isn’t canonical.

[Yes they have (see near the bottom - the adventure games are part of the canon, apparently)](http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/04_april/08/doctor_who.shtml)

to cry. The inconsiderate little shit then ran home leaving his bike in the middle of the road. Being the shining example of a heroic citizen that i am, i moved his bike onto the pavement. 

This took at least 30seconds of my valuable time. I thought about suing the kids parents because he didnt have a helmet on or anything.

However, i did not deem this necessary as the bland, hilarious thud sound the kid made at the moment of contact with the road, induced a smile on my face and a slight chuckle was adequate payment in this instance. 

Furthermore the fact that i felt obliged to relocate his bike in a safer location was a duty covered by the hilarity tax of seeing a hurt child.

Rather, I was pointing out that the *end result* is more or less the same in terms of what the vast majority of households end up paying.  The way that the amount is calculated, or how the money is used (or not) to fund local services is largely (albeit not entirely) irrelevant in practical terms.

&gt;  Your comment about the poor is false in this case.

I think you may have missed the point I was trying to make there.  I *agree* that the difference between per-person and per-property taxes *does* make a difference to the very poor (lots of people living in small accommodation) and the very rich (few people living in large properties) - hence my proviso: *""except the very rich and very poor""*.  But for most other people who live in houses that are roughly proportional in size to the number of people living there (e.g. 1 person bedsit, a couple living in a flat or small house, a 3 or 4 person family living in a larger house, etc), the amounts they pay per-person or per-property is roughly the same.

I'm not defending the poll tax or suggesting that per-property isn't a better way to calculate the tax.  Just saying that it doesn't amount to a hill of beans except in the edge cases where people are living 5 to a room, or have 5 rooms per person.  Those living 5 to a room are living in poverty by any reasonable definition and they shouldn't be paying any taxes in the first place.  Those who have 4 rooms to spare might be filthy rich (tax them to to the hilt!) but could also include little old ladies living by themselves in their family home that they really don't want to leave. In that sense, the per-person tax is probably fairer.  But one can easily find examples to justify either position.

As with egalitarianism; I'm not talking about the dictionary definition, but the actual practice. I'm saying that anyone who claims to be an egalitarian but not to be a feminist, is not actually an egalitarian at all, because women are *not* currently equal, they're worse off in almost every way, and 99% of efforts towards equality need to focus on women if equality is ultimately the goal.

People who identify as egalitarians in my experience, interpret that as ""we should spend equal amounts of effort helping men and women"", the consequence of which is of course that men remain better off and get to feel morally fulfilled about it as well.

It's a vicious circle really, the ticket price pretty much goes directly to the studio and the cinema lives (or dies) from the concessions... but it just costs so damn much.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; My issue with your statements is that you appear to believe that what The Sun reported was correct despite the fact that they have admitted this information was false.

In summary: 

* One of the three allegations on the front page (that emergency responders were abused and attacked) was absolutely true. The Hillsborough Independent Panel have confirmed this, but attributed it rather generously to a frustration on the part of fans;

* With regards to the other allegations (i.e. the dead being robbed, police being urinated on), the Independent Panel were not able to independently verify them, but that doesn't put to rest whether they actually occurred or not;

* Although *The Sun* have now come out stating the allegations were false, their incentives do not necessarily align with telling the truth, and this does not serve as evidence that the remaining allegations were false;

* My view is that there is a *possibility* that these remaining allegations are true, and I would not be the least bit surprised if they were. This is for all the reasons I've explained (i.e. the fact the actions were relatively mundane things to do while drunk, that they were made shocking and grossly inappropriate only by the context, and that many fans present at the time were not aware of the context)

&gt; Moreover, your conclusions seem to be based on your own bias of how drunk people commonly behave. 

Firstly, it's not a bias, and secondly, the statements should not be interpreted as a description of how drunk people ""commonly behave"". People respond to excessive alcohol consumption in different ways.

Many people respond to it by becoming aggressive, confrontational, and outspoken. Emergency services frequently find themselves the victims of verbal or physical abuse when dealing with drunk people. Ask literally any police officer or paramedic. They'll happily confirm what a delight it is to deal with drunk people.

Many respond to it by losing their inhibitions and committing criminal acts. Alcohol-related crime. It's a thing. Opportunistic theft is one of the least serious crimes to commit while drunk.

&gt; Lastly, using the 'overly-sensitive Liverpudlian' line is a troll too far for me and makes me believe I've been had. Goodbye :)

23 years have passed. At least five billion people have died since Hillsborough, many in far more tragic circumstances.

He hoped his shoes were shining.

How shall I deal with you? 
Have you always turned the other cheek?
To My church have you been true?""

The policeman squared his shoulders and said,
""No, Lord, I guess I ain't,
Because those of us who carry badges
can't always be a saint.

I've had to work most Sundays,
and at times my talk was rough,
and sometimes I've been violent,
Because the streets are awfully tough.

But I never took a penny,
That wasn't mine to keep....
Though I worked a lot of overtime
When the bills got just too steep.

And I never passed a cry for help,
Though at times I shook with fear.
And sometimes, God forgive me,
I've wept unmanly tears.

I know I don't deserve a place
Among the people here.
They never wanted me around
Except to calm their fear.

If you've a place for me here,
Lord, It needn't be so grand.
I never expected or had too much,
But if you don't.....I'll understand.

There was silence all around the throne
Where the saints had often trod.
As the policeman waited quietly,
For the judgment of his God.

You've borne your burdens well.
Come walk a beat on Heaven's streets,
You've done your time in hell.""

The problem could be sorted almost overnight but that would mean a massive shift to the right wing. 

In the UK we police by consent that is to say that citizens are willing to give up a few rights and freedoms to be protected. (Such as being subjected to stop and searched pulled over in the car routinely)

If we were to stop the drug supply effectively that would mean horrific powers such as being able to search peoples homes whenever we want without any warrants. and also very long jail terms for offenders.

This would impact massively on the decent hardworking people that make up 99% of this country. we in the process of enacting the above hypothetical right wing laws would alienate the 99% and they would turn against us and we would lose the policing by consent factor. 

Due to this it would then become a police state because technically if enough people disagree with the police we can no longer police by consent but obviously the police will always exist in one form or another even if the majority disagreed so that would give rise to the police state.

true,AnalyticContinuation,null,null,"The gist of the problem is that you are allowed to capture images of your own premises without any problem. But if you capture images of other people's premises then you need to start providing a justification under the Data Protection Act. See this extract from the website that Andrew998 referenced.

&gt;Mr. Smith at 11 Acacia Avenue has a CCTV system installed which monitors persons accessing his premises. It picks up any visitor as soon as they enter the gate and only captures their images whilst they are on his property.

&gt;(a) Mr. Smith is entitled to do this.

&gt;(b) He does not need to provide a notice saying that the person is entering a CCTV controlled area.

&gt;(c) He is not required to provide a copy of the footage he has captured to the Data Subject if they make a request. However, if that CCTV camera picks up images outside Mr. Smith's premises, such as the entrance to his neighbour's premises or persons walking down Acacia Avenue, then he has to consider the implications of the Data Protection Act.

&gt;He must consider what justification he has in capturing the images of visitors to his neighbours, or those persons on Acacia Avenue. Note, I am not saying that he can't, only that he has to justify it. Schedule 2 of the Data Protection Act lists six conditions that can justify processing of personal data. Mr. Smith would have to satisfy just one of them in order to capture those images.

&gt;Personally, I feel he would be hard put to find one of the conditions that would meet this requirement. Even if he proved me wrong, he would have to put up a notice to notify the persons walking into his neighbour's garden or walking along Acacia Avenue that they were being caught by CCTV camera, the purposes of those images being caught, and who was responsible for the processing. He would also have to provide a copy of the images if the Data Subjects made an access request.

&gt;Clearly the solution to this is to ensure that the CCTV camera does not pick up any images that are not within Mr. Smith's premises.",0,1347973623,null,0,false,0,c69w174,t3_102r10,t1_c69w174,t3_102r10,null,1429928770,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

a few points.

1: CCTV (in the traditional sense) is only used to view and record public spaces. Public is the important distinction here.

2: You have no right to privacy in public spaces. Im pretty sure the royals where in a private space.

3: No one was asked if you agree with CCTV because it does not infringe on your privacy.

4: The Royals where not in a public space when they where recorded.

5: CCTV that's installed in toilets (would love to see a link to this) are no doubt on private land. And as such the owner of the property has every right to install cameras. Also, I doubt very much that cameras have been installed in cubicals?

6: You, me, photographers etc...have every right to record anything that's viewable from and in a public space. There are caveats to this rule - for example using very long lenses to spy on peoples private activity, or to spy into/though windows of private proprieties, or to harasser people, spy on people etc...

CCTV in public, or that overlooks public spaces should have a sign saying something like ""CCTV in use""^3 and the details of the registered data holder to the ICO (normally the company details). This is the waiver to the public essentially.

There was definitely a reasonable expectation of privacy at a private villa where a telephoto lens is required to get these photos, it is most certainly not the same as being caught walking down the street where we expect there to be CCTV.

It seems fun to me, but in a hobbyist sense. I already like shooting and boy scout style stuff, nature and outdoorsing and whatnot, so for that reason I kind of see it appealing just as a fun pastime which has a practical application. But some of those people have some fucking astonishing ideas about polar shifts and peak oil crises and global economic downturns and whatnot, and they take it to extremes. Some are enviable for the resources they have, like their little self-contained underground bunkers with stockpiles and alternative fuel sources made from pulped leaves and newspaper (everyone likes a secret hideout or treehouse, it brings out the kid in you). Others are just bananas, pure and simple - disinfecting every inch of the house, preparing OP/LP sites, living primarily off foraged bugs and the sort.

For the most part I think people are right about it being people having lots of money and lots of time, and a lot of these people seem either to have spent too much time reading conspiracy theory messageboards or just had their worldview shattered by the September 11th attacks, no longer able to go about life under the misapprehension that the USA is an untouchable bastion of solace separated from the world.

I think we haven't heard the last of the 'only 12 reincarnations' thing.

I think that when a timelord reaches that last reincarnation he can choose to absorb the life force of another person(s) to extend his own count of regenerative cycles. 

When The Master was revivied in 'The End of Time' he did a similar thing to restore himself. Although it has been revealed 12 reincarnations is self imposed, it may be self imposed in the sense that the ritual\act of the sacrifice is forbidden

I think the question being asked is who will the doctor sacrifice to extend his own regeneration count. ""Doctor Who?""

And he must answer, then silence falls, a metaphor maybe? The end of the songs of praise (ala the Ood) or someones death maybe, or perhaps the literal end of the slience as a group.

Also, this ritual may be the cause of the splitting of the 12th doctor into the Valeyard.

""Step forward, Simon Harwood. Have you ever caused a crash? And then blamed the other driver, and then given his face a smash?

And then falsified a police report, to say that he's to blame? And tell me Mr Harwood, is this the only man you've framed?""

The policeman squared his shoulders and said, ""Lord, I ain't no saint, but there was a full enquiery after that bloke's complaint""

""But I manged to get out of it, by saying I was sick, and then joining another force, and transferring back real quick""

""That way you start again, all fresh and nice and new. You can abuse you powers once again 'cause there's no track of just who's who!""

""But then after that, two-thousand-and-four"", The Lord said all unstable, ""Didn't you smash a guys face in with your fist and throw him through a table?""

""Yeah, that one I got away with"" Simon Harwood stressed ""There's loads more, how about that time I kneed a 14 year old black girl in the chest?""

""But none of these incidences were ever mentioned in your trail?"" ""No, they weren't allowed to"" Said PC Simon with a smile

""They can only use the evidence from the day I killed that guy, so the only real accounts come from my 15 colleges at my side""

""And so they all agreed we were surrounded by protesters, and I only lashed out because I was trying to protect us""

""and even though video footage later showed this was a lie, what can a court really do when 15 coppers all conspire?""

""So we got a dodgy coroner to say he had a heart attack, which was completely unrelated to my needless baton smack""

""He later got struck off for being bent and unreliable, but by that time we'd already finished the whole trial""

""And now I've lost my job, but don't worry, I should mention, I get to keep my benefits and a full Policeman's pension""

There was silence all around the throne Where the saints had often trod. As the policeman waited quietly, For the judgment of his God.

""Well, you're a violent bastard"" The Lord God did admit, ""And you killed a man in anger, and left his wife and kids""

""with no father to come home to. And then you rigged his case, as you've clearly done before when you smashed in that bloke's face""

""Or framed that guy for an accident, that you yourself had caused, but when all is said and done, I guess I'd have to say..."" God paused

""That you should come in to heaven"" The Lord God said with some constraint. ""Since, in the end, you're a policeman, and every policeman is a saint!""

And so the moral of this story is, it doesn't matter what you've done, you're clearly a good person if you have a badge and fire a gun

(This may be hard to swallow, if your dad died from being whacked by a bent copper with a history of unprovoked attacks

But try to understand you must bare your burdens well, you have no idea what it is like to live in a policeman's hell)

true,Prairie_Dog,cyberman,Cyberperson,"I understand Netflix has a lot of them, but I don't use it myself. I've read that they put the 4-8 serials together into a single  package which is listed as a movie. Others may be available by the DVD option. 

On iTunes you can access the classic offerings sorted by Doctor by selecting menus following these steps in order:  iTunes Store; TV Shows; Category - Sci-Fi &amp;amp; Fantasy (top right drop down); More in TV - Doctor Who (second from bottom right drop down); then you have the listings from Eleventh Doctor at the top to First Doctor at the bottom. These are much cheaper than buying the DVDs.

Then there is your public library, many have the DVDs for checkout. More may be obtained by interlibrary loan.

Amazon has pretty much all the DVDs, sometimes they have used ones at a significant discount via Amazon Merchants.

Now, if you want to know where the available episodes from any of these sources fall within the original broadcast order, this Wikipedia guide is your friend:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials

Let me say right away that In Classic Who, viewing order is nowhere near as important as the new series. Most serials were stand-alone stories, multi-episode story arcs were the exception, not the rule. There were a few connected stories, notably the Trial of a Time-Lord season, the E-Space Trilogy, the Black Guardian Trilogy; and The Key to Time Series. Other than that, you really don't have to worry a lot about watching the episodes in order. Personally, I like skipping around from Doctor to Doctor for variety.

There was the Seddon double shooting in July, but that didn't have rolling TV coverage nor comment from the PM.

    Zagreus sits inside your head

    Zagreus at the end of days
    Zagreus lies all other ways
    Zagreus comes when time's a maze
    And all of history's weeping

    Zagreus taking time apart.
    Zagreus fears the hero heart.
    Zagreus seeks the final part.
    The reward that he is reaping.

    Zagreus sings when all is lost
    Zagreus takes all those he's crossed
    Zagreus wins and all is cost
    The hero's hearts he's keeping.

    Zagreus seeks the hero's ship
    Zagreus needs the web to rip
    Zagreus sups time at a drip
    And life aside, he's sweeping.

    And he set then his course
    To a scar on the face of Creation
    Where the stars lived and died in the churn of one night
    Where the mountains might move in the blink of an eye
    And decay was the only true constant


    And the gate of Zagreus opened before him
    And all of the Antiverse was releaved to him
    And its terrible beauty ached in his hearts

    So through them he ventured
    There to do battle with Zagreus, the Beast
    Never resting as long as history is lasting
    Until either or both are laid to waste.

    Zagreus waits at the end of the world
    For Zagreus is the end of the world
    His time is the end of time

Yeah but you're not seeing what I'm saying. There's two sides to the coin isn't there?

If Ian Tomlinson's family read OP's poem, they wouldn't think it's appropriate.

All I'm saying is, only this week a policeman got retired with full benefits and pension after murdering an innocent man with his hands in his pockets. That case affected me, it moved me, I felt terrible for how it must feel to have a family member killed and then get no justice for it simply because the killer has friends in the right places. It must be awful. And that's what was in my mind when I read the OP's poem about how 'policmen may break they rules but it doesn't matter they do a damn good job anyway'.

I mean, I *really* disagree with the point; I couldn't just not say anything.

Anyway, calm down and we can talk about this rationally. I'm not trying to rustle people's jimmies. Even though it was a bit of a cunt-move, I feel I've stood up for it in, although you might not agree with it, quite a logical and valid way.

   - The Doctor: Oh you mean...

   - Madame Vastra: Quite.

   - The Doctor: Well how would I know? That's all human and private stuff. It just sort of goes on, they don't put up a balloon or anything!

   - Madame Vastra: **Well could the child have begun on the TARDIS, in flight in the Vortex?**

   - The Doctor: No! No! Impossible! It's all running about, sexy fish vampires. And blowing up stuff. And Rory wasn't even there at the beginning. Then he was dead. Then he didn't exist.

I went because it was a part of my Uni course. I went as part of the Erasmus scheme.

**Was it part of your undergraduate course or was it a masters/phd?**

BA Ancient History and Spanish

**Which country and university?**

Spain, Universidad de Salamanca

**What subject?**

While there I studied history, geography and French.

**What was the country like (culture shocks, expenses, everything)?**

Everything was far cheaper. My landlord was a bit ropey, as was my contract to live in the flat. Still, much much cheaper. Drinking was drastically cheaper over there, food was a bit cheaper too.

I struggled to adapt to Spanish eating a bit. Different times of day, and eating with people was a much different experience. You don't get your own plate of food, but rather you get your plate and you help yourself. It's almost like a buffet, but not, because you're still sat around a table. It's not the done thing to just fill up your plate and go for it, you take a little bit at a time.

Other than that, very little in terms of culture shock. It was just a bit more laid back.

**Where there any differences in the learning culture there?**

Jesus, yes. The essays were far bigger, considering I was doing first year modules. Several times I did 15 page reports. Also, they weren't too big on analysis. Considering I did history, including history of philosophy, I did no analysis like I do in the UK. It was a simple case of writing down all the facts in exams and reports.  I say simple, as this caused me problems; a few times, I discussed possible causes and branching effects, which was ignored because it was conjecture.

The native students had a good work ethic it seemed, better than in the UK. Then again, they are aware that Spain is not going to hand them a job.

**What would do differently if doing it again?**

Not much. I visited a lot of the country, I made a lot of friends, including many Spaniards, and as such my Spanish improved greatly. I passed the year with little room to spare, but my home university only weighs in the marks into my overall level if it's in my best interest.

**Did you find any useful resources before applying that you could share (websites, youtube vids, blogs)?**

Erasmus universities have a network run by students called ESN. Look up the ESN of wherever you're going on Facebook and join the group, and post a message to say a little about yourself for public viewing. People will get in touch, including in my case some local people, so you'll have some people to go for a drink with and get your bearings in your first weeks. Having a guy there who was just friendly helped me feel settled very quickly.

**Feel free to add anything extra**

Just because the Guardian's bad, doesn't mean the Sun isn't worse by being corrupt. The people of Liverpool found out what it costs you to trust someone corrupt.

This is true they are trying to make people change. But even for electric cars the non engineering types really haven't thought about them properly *yet*

Some issues with current electric cars are

Cars weight around 4 tons instead of 1 ton or less. This means speeds of 60 mph will almost always have enough kinetic energy to kill or do real serious damage depending on what it strikes.

Again the weight. Being 4 times the weight this will require more energy to produce better bearings / breaks more break replacements / stronger / heavier tyres and most of all use more energy to get the car moving in start / stop traffic. Though it moves the pollution problem elsewhere is kinda adds to it as well :)

Assume that there are 50 million people driving in the UK and assume that batteries have a lifetime of 5 years. What are they going to do with ~200 million tons of dead batteries every 5 years?

Current electric cars just like wind turbines just don't work.

(TakenByVultures did link the same thing already but got downvoted, maybe percieved bias as they are a Manc, I'm in london so you can both hate me equally, which is a kind of unbiased isn't it? ;))

If they just meant second biggest / second largest population I wonder if the answers would have been different if they actually asked that.

I suspect overall accuracy wouldn't improve much since I don't suppose most people are good at knowing the sizes of cities especially when in both cases they have a far greater connurbation which makes strict city populations somewhat academic.

With all that nitpicking out of the way, I take the broader point, that for the second (biggest) city Birmingham doesn't have the highest profile.  As someone with no particular horse in the race, if for some bizarre reason _I_ was given the choice of England's official second city, and had to make it off the top of my head, no research, lobbying, focus groups etc - I would probably pick Manchester, it feels like it has more cultural visibility/impact (no offense Brum) and also being in the North feels like it better evens out the N/S divide.

Regarding my ""no offense Brum"", I don't want to be as rude as to imagine Birmingham's notable contributions past and present are lesser, so what is it - has Manc just done a better job of ""marketing""?  Does Manchester ""subsume"" / ""claim"" more stuff from Greater Manc in the consciousness of outsiders like me while the various non-Birmingham parts of the west midlands metro area maintained a more separate identity?

true,insoundfromwayout,null,null,"I think that's a bit unfair. The original poem had lines such as *"" I guess I ain't [been good], Because those of us who carry badges can't always be a saint""* and *""I've been violent, Because the streets are awfully tough.""*

That's quite plainly legitimizing police negligence (in the first line) and violence (in the second) because they have a tough job. And then it ends with God saying that the Policeman deserves his place in heaven, since he has already served the 'Hell' of police work, which is apparently all that matters. So as long as you are a policeman, even if you are negligent and violent, you still get into heaven because all police are good, no matter what they do.

So I think, to sum it up as  ""all cops are saints even if they break the rules"", is quite fair.

Whereas my poem can't be summed up as ""all cops are cunts""; I was talking about one police officer in particular, and the high profile case that has been in the news recently. I just tried to put a face to the person in the OP's poem. Simon Harwood was a violent and negligent police officer, and when you try to make the argument, in poem form, that even though he was violent and negligent he is still a great guy because he was a policeman, you see how stupid the OP's poem is.

So that's all it was saying. It was simple satire. I wasn't making a grande political point. 

And as for just replying with ""Please don't imply that all cops are heroes"" or something similar, that would hardly have the same power to it. My point was, that the poem makes a terrible, objectionable point. By rewriting it, but actually including a real-life violent negligent policeman that we all recognise in place of the nameless faceless one in the original poem, we see just how crazy it is.

Know what I mean?

Lol, I feel like I'm writing an English essay!

Anyway, I admit it was a bit insensitive, if you are the sensitive type. But it had a point, it is something that I care about, I think the point was clear and well made, and even if not a lot of people agreed with me I still think it's important that someone said something instead of nodding and agreeing with such a dumb, dangerous poem.

There's another advantage for them as well. Since they tend to have international clients, having employees with passports for different countries is a major benefit. It makes it very easy to send them to client sites in their own countries for brief periods without having to worry about arranging visas for each individual trip.

The street Tomlinson died on was quiet at the time, and the group of officers Harwood was part of was not ""in the middle of a violent protest"".

&gt;You haven't already asked these grannies to move and then been ignored

Tomlinson was *moving away from them* at the time. Regardless, ignoring a request to move does not justify physical force being used.

&gt;It's not your job to get these grannies to move. ie, you have no reason to even touch them

Again, Tomlinson was no threat to Harwood and was walking away from him with his hands in his pockets. Harwood had no reason to touch him either.

I would genuinely like to see a source on this. Regardless, seeing a colleague being punched should not cause a police officer to hit and push a random harmless member of the public.

As for my sarcasm, that was my intent. I even said that after people over reacted to my post. It was something my girlfriend noticed, and something she said. I'm not holding Doctor Who to some high standard, which people seemed to think I was. Some people got pissy because I said ""Dr. Who"" instead of ""Doctor Who"". But yeah, sarcasm is kind of hard to detect over the internet sometimes, hence why I made the statement that it was sarcasm.  
As for your initial comment. You were the one to make to aggressive comment to me first, about what my supposed intent was... even thought I explained it in the comment you replied to.  
And of course some people don't like what I posted. But my response was to those who didn't understand I was being sarcastic. There is a significant difference between someone stating this post is merely dumb, or lame and someone posting about how I hold Doctor Who to such a high standard. One comment obviously doesn't understand my intention, hence why I clarified. 
And again, I'll point out that you directly quote me then quote a hypothetical statement. That would imply I said, and I didn't. So again, I get defensive, just as you do, when people put words in other's mouths.

true,storyuncovered,null,null,"Dale Cregan is a low I.Q. hired thug. Somebody paid this Neanderthal to do these jobs, and Mr Cregan has happily obliged.  

Mark Short was killed by Cregan and his gang due to his families involvement in the distribution of cocaine across the Greater Manchester area and he had previous firearm related offences associated with the drug dealing business he chose to be in. 

His father David Short, had publicly vowed retaliation for his sons murder and this was the reason for the pre-emptive attack which left David Short dead.  

Cregan and his accomplice then proceeded to visit the home of another witness that was due to testify against Cregans associates and fired shots and threw a grenade into the property, this particular attack was a failure in that the witness is still able to give evidence, but the severity of the attack stopped the flow of information from the public due to the fear of a similar fate.


Then nothing for a while.


Every single time the Police in Manchester had the slightest suspicion on the whereabouts of Dale Cregan, they swarmed the area with masked armed officers and helicopter support and were prepared for him to use deadly force against them.  

He was hiding and somebody was helping him, probably a gang or family member but his distinctive face meant he could not be seen in public at all. He was being fed and sheltered by somebody but the person that had paid him for this job had since cut off all contact and once the person hiding him stopped helping him he needed a way out.


This fuckwits planning ended the day of the first grenade attack, he hadn't thought any further than that, no false passport, no well stocked hideout out in the sticks.
He will have moved just once to the empty house in Mottram and laid low with a mobile phone thinking this last move out. 

He decided to call the Police to report a burglary knowing that just one car would show up, he probably expected one or two policemen to arrive, when he saw two ladies get out he panicked, this wasn't what he'd thought about, he wanted to shoot men, now he was going to look like like a pussy.  

Then his final cowardly thought, ""What if two women arrest me,  ME ARRESTED BY FUCKING WOMEN?"" Every pull of the trigger that followed was from fear and panic, the grenade was the crescendo to his story, he had it in his pocket since the Droylsden attack and would always have used it even if it meant suicide, but he could not bring himself to do that, and in a twist that could only happen in a country respectful to all human rights, a Neanderthal was allowed to hand himself in and enjoy the protection of the police from the devastated families he has left in his wake.

GMP know who hired Dale Cregan but as always happens in these kinds of cases, their isn't enough high quality evidence to connect A to Z.  GMP will know the source of the weapons already, especially the grenades and I hope for the sake of these two young officers that a dent (I'm sad that this is the most I can honestly hope for) is made in the arms supply to this countries criminals and the supply of cocaine to Britain's streets. But for all of the effort that will undoubtedly go into this future investigation, Cregan will one day be free.  Maybe instead of hacking celebrities phone calls, this countries media should use their collective arsenal of intrepid investigators and put it to use finding evidence against the people that caused this to happen, starting from the top of the food chain not the bottom.",0,1348010999,null,0,false,0,c6a5ftr,t3_102or5,t1_c6a5ftr,t3_102or5,null,1429933300,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

As for people on powerful machines never being young, almost any sports bike is ""powerful"", so, yes, there are young people on those bikes. ""Really"" powerful ones obviously accelerate faster etc etc, but the risk of killing yourself is just as high on a less powerful bike. Besides, I never ""blamed"" younger riders, all I'm saying is the few times I've seen motorcyclists riding dangerously has been when they were clearly younger people than middle aged.

When I said it was no different, I meant more about it's effect on you as the driver of the vehicle. A person driving a car is just as likely to crash if they're going too fast and are not able to drive at that speed. Same applies to riding.

I just want to make it clear, I never said that. If Real Madrid would have been interested, that's where I'd be now, but they weren't so I'm not. City were always interested ever since I played in the Copa America. They told me about City's professionalism, so I had no other choice than to go to City.""

true,panickedthumb,pertwee,Pertwee,"Impartial observer here-- you were probably downvoted initially for being incredibly nitpicky-- ""Doctors"" has always been shorthand for ""incarnations/regenerations of The Doctor"" because it's much less cumbersome to say/type. If I may go into Who theory for a moment-- we all know it's the same being, but it's a different body, with a different personality, so one could easily argue it's different enough to be considered ""Doctors"" as more than just shorthand. *The Doctor himself* has referred to his previous incarnations as ""He"" instead of ""I"" on occasion. Even The Doctor himself seems less concerned with this than you are. ;)  

Should you have been downvoted for that? Perhaps not. It isn't punitive as you suggest-- reddiquette suggests downvoting for posts that don't add to the conversation. I think a reasonable argument could be made that your first comment didn't, but it straddles the line.

You were probably downvoted the second time (albeit less than before, still staying in positive territory) for being quite standoffish, to put it nicely, with ""don't downvote me since you seem to enjoy taking everything absolutely literally."" Talking down to someone is a good way to get downvotes. I'm surprised this one doesn't have a lower score than your first.

Your third comment here, the one I'm currently replying to, is at 0 points as of me stumbling upon it. This is probably because ""if you don't straighten up, I'm leaving"" comments always seem to get downvoted pretty quickly. It just goes with the turf on reddit.

But more generally, don't worry about downvotes. Just relax, join in the discussion, if it goes a way you don't like, just stop replying. If you get downvotes, ignore them. If you get upvotes, ignore those too. They're just numbers, and they matter far less than fun.",0,1348023870,null,0,false,0,c6a8owm,t3_103lc8,t1_c6a8owm,t1_c6a8hgr,null,1429934873,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

He was egregious, he loved excitement, he tried to live life to the fullest and enjoy everything he could. Underneath it all he was a man afraid of death, afraid of change, and afraid of his own mortality.

So yeah, regenerating would seem like ""dying and becoming someone else with all my memories but not really me"" to a guy like that. We see a hint of it when he's shot by the Dalek and aborts his regeneration by shooting all that yellow stuff into his hand - he comments ""Used the regeneration energy to heal myself, but soon as that was done, I didn't need to change. **I didn't want to, why would I, look at me.**""

The guy has a deep seated issue with the notion of doing something he'd been perfectly happy to do prior to this - simply because of what he was like in this particular incarnation.

* **Spearhead From Space** - Introduction of the Third Doctor and UNIT. Arguably one of the best Doctor introductions the series has ever had.

* **Terror of the Autons** - Introduction of new companion Jo Grant, Mike Yates, and the Master.

* **The Time Warrior** - Introduction of Sarah Jane Smith, the Sontarans. Begins the end of the Third Doctor's era and the beginning of the Fourth.

* **The Face of Evil** - Introduction of new companion Leela.

* **The Ribos Operation** - Introduction of Romana, the beginning of the ""Key to Time"" storyarc.

* **The Keeper of Traken** - Introduction of Nyssa, begins the closing of the Fourth Doctor's long era.

* **Dragonfire** - A Seventh Doctor story that introduces the ever so splendid firecracker Ace

It's important to remember that no Doctor, if they did in fact ""die"", ever experienced some other man sauntering away. If they died they weren't around for that experience. This is simply Ten's theorizing, and I believe he had more opportunities than any other Doctor to face and contemplate it. 

If a Doctor felt that regeneration was simply a change of appearance, the next Doctor would retain all his memories and feel as though he was vindicated. The last Doctor was not around to say he didn't really exist anymore. Ten was the first after the time war to really get used to his own personality. And, *undeniably*, there is some sense in which regeneration is death. In another sense it is not, but habits and feelings and instincts and predilections and so forth are a huge part of what makes you *you*, and if you lost all or most of those, would you still exist?

I only started with the new Who, but I caught myself up fairly well on the mythology and classic stuff before I got to the End of Time, and I think this is a deep philosophical question that needed to be addressed.

From my perspective, No, ""he"" is not still in there somewhere. But would he want to be? Trapped in a different personality? But parts of him stay around. Just like when you or I die the stories we used to tell or the arguments we used to make or the stupid expressions we used to use will be carried on by our friends and families.

You hit the nail on the head. It's the same formula as Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock is this high thinking eccentric detective that doesn't always make sense, and is way smarter than anyone reading the stories. Watson is there to be your window into the stories, so you have someone you can relate to on your own level.

If I were to really critique this picture, it'd go like this: First, it's way too heavy on the right side, weighted down by the single mass that is Smith's arm being connected to a slightly-too-large Tennant. That weight draws my attention down to to the feet, where I notice that Smith's are further up the ground than the others, subsequently positioning his body too high on the chair, to where it looks like he's floating - Although Eccleston and Tennant are leaning forward, their feet would remain in the same area, unless they scooted up a bunch (but the shadows aren't indicitave of that.) 

Then my eyes are drawn to the big black abyss that is the couch's shadow blended with Eccleston's pants, which then brings my attention to the oddly flat looking coat tails against the black background. The shop job there is pretty noticeable to the unscrutinizing eye.

Furthermore, Eccleston is leaning left past the couch backing where we can't see the edge, whereas Tennant's right arm is flush with the right side of the couch, it gives the effect of the right side being slightly larger, creating a slight perspective shift of the couch. Also, because Smith and Tennant's arms are touching, for me it immediately registers as one mass, and when compared to the lone figure on the right, the imbalance is even more prominent. 

Lastly, Eccleston has considerably less hair than Smith or Tennant and the weight of their dark, making him seem like a smaller figure than the others. Tennant and Smith are also wearing articles of bright white, which catches the eye's attention before Eccleston's clothing. 

**tl;dr:** Smith and Tennant are sitting too close, Smith is sitting too far up and looks like he's hovering, right side is heavier than the left, eyes are first drawn to the bright white of Smith and Tennant's clothing before Eccleston, Eccleston is sitting further left on the couch than Tennant is to the right, and lack of hair and/or contact with the other two makes Eccleston look smaller and more isolated.

That's not a chant localised to the vociferous parts of the Kop, a large proportion of the crowd joins in most matches. Hopefully people will realise that it's going to be antagonistic in this sort of atmosphere.

Whoever starts, it is highly likely to lead to the away fans singing the victim chants, which will be construed by everyone as a point about hillsborough, but will defended by whoever sings it as being about Suarez/Evra (like the ManU supporters trust did after last weekend). The pivotal point is whether it's a dozen ****s who are booed out or whether it's the full away section in Anfield Road Stand

Thankfully Evra looks unlikely to start (and I'd be pretty confident Ferguson wouldn't pick him even if he was fit), so ""handshake-gate"" won't add more fuel to the fire. Full credit to Ferguson, he has mellowed out significantly in the last few years, and as part of that, he seems to have learned how his normal mindgames have incited the worst factions of the ManU support. Whether because of that or because we've fallen off the radar somewhat, he has become increasingly vocal in burying the hatchet.

This is such a pivotal point in the relationship between the two clubs - it's an opportunity to excise the entirely pointless, needless, hurtful parts of our rivalry on both sides.
