The British Government needed a reason to cover up for the fact that the Germans had been systematically bombing a certain area in the West Midlands. The location was host to the fledgling British rocketry program, which had resulted in a Corporal from the 1st Queen's Stratosphere Light Division reaching a low earth orbit in early 1940. This was, as you might imagine, highly top secret with the need to invent the 'city' in order to cover up the existence of the base to the general public, who were suspicious of anything space related after the 1937 ""Crystal Palace Live Space Granny Extravagaza"" which I won't have to detail, of course.

The invention of Coventry also had the bonus propaganda element of bolstering British support against the nasty old Jerries, similar to the fighting spirit the Blitz in London installed in the populace.

After the war, and the onset of the new season ""Winter"" which as we all now know resulted from northern hemisphere going into a sulk over the increased importation of bananas and other tropical fruit, chilly northerners began their migration south. To save the home counties and city of London from the influx of such people, the city of Coventry was quickly poured from cement mixers. Of course to give the place an air of authenticity, a crack legion of historians and sociologists quickly invented a potted history of the place. One of the 'legends' appropriated by the scholars was the Peeping Tom story. Plus it meant the city got a statue of a lady on a horse with her tits out: ""Brass Knockers"" being a subtle dig at the fact that undesirable northern types were heading south.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Let's just make shit up about the evil ECHR with absolutely no legal argument to sustain it.

&gt; *The ECHR will make it mandatory for all people to be gay, because that's equal*.

See I can be stupid too.

Here's the thing that idiots like the 'archbishop' don't understand.

**Human Rights Law only applies to state institutions**.

So any business is allowed to discriminate against blacks, gays or what have you and the ECHR **will not even bite**. 

Of course, a government may choose to make private discrimination illegal, as ours has, and there's the interesting question of whether a state trying to deprive people of an existing statute that prevents discrimination is, itself, state discrimination.

That's a moot point though. The statute allowing gay marriage can either be negatively worded (so the state is not giving churches an exemption but is instead giving secular organisations permission) or could probably get away with a religious exemption explicitly.

After all, religious discrimination has ~~been upheld~~ not been found in breach of the ECHR by the court on a number of limited grounds over the years (think catholic adoption, etc).The ECHR doesn't operate in a vacuum either, and will be well aware that, given the rights-raising effect legalising gay marriage has, creating hostility across the continent by creating an incredibly activist principle that religious organisations must take part too is not at all an effective way of realising that.

In short this idiot needs to shut up, or cite some case law.


Edit: Changed some wording so it doesn't sound like the court is certifying discrimination. ",0,1332327748,null,0,true,0,c43aqq7,t3_r6jum,t1_c43aqq7,t3_r6jum,null,1428565291,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"But placebos can ""cure"" some ""real"" problems though - and interestingly enough some studies show that placebos can even work even when you're told that it's a placebo, haha (does that still count as a placebo? hmm)...

But anyway the point is that if it can help then it should probably be prescribable - obviously based on the doctors expert knowledge of your symptoms, etc. You will often be prescribed things by the doctor that won't even help with your problem anyway as they often work on a trial + error basis, and multiple visits are required to get your problem resolved. That isn't due to them sucking and mis-diagnosing, it's just how it's done.

Eg. if I have some underlying problem causing inflammation, they will probably just prescribe an anti-inflammatory first to keep it down for a while, then if it comes back after that period is over it's time to check into further causes. I guess because a full check-up, xray, etc. is unreasonable (or too expensive) every time someone has a swollen knee that could have been caused by running, or knocking it on something, falling over, etc.

I do kind of have issues with (non-)disclosure of the fact that you've been prescribed a placebo though, and I do understand your concern there... but at the same time it seems that if solid science backs up the effect they will have on your problem, why drug you up unnecessarily?

Would you prefer if the doctor told you to stop whining and that's it's all in your head? Maybe refer you to a psychologist? Hmm... Although I think one of the points here is that that isn't the right thing to do anyway, as the placebo *may not* help at all, it's just another step in the diagnosis and the doctor will not really ever be confident in it working anyway, or in the fact that you could come back again just as with the anti-inflammatory case mentioned.

I get the impression from some of the posts here that there isn't a grasp of this (probably an age thing), and that opposing it wasn't an extreme view at all. Germany unified very late in European terms, and when it did it had the power (and used it) to kill millions of people and destroy empires and nations.

A unified Germany means an economic power house* and population size that completely dominates Europe, and a geography that means potential military threat to many nations. 

What has happened is that Germany does not punch its weight internationally and keeps a relatively low profile compared to its real power. This is by choice and can change.

Kohl managed to railroad it through in what turned out to be a very small window. In fact many in East Germany opposed it too, but he seized the moment and made it happen.

There's no such thing as ""unlimited"", because you can only get so much data down the wires at at time.

So you might be able to fit £1000 a month of data down your broadband connection, or £2000's worth, but there's a limit.

That's clearly a ridiculous amount - no-one would ever want to pay that much for a home connection, but I'm pretty sure A&amp;A would sell it to you if you could afford it.

[As I said in another comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/r5o5q/fellow_uk_redditors_which_in_your_opinion_is_the/c43anyo), I really mentioned them to make a point about the nature of the word ""best"" and the subjective nature of it. A&amp;A are *absolutely* the best when it comes to customer service, technical support, obscure technical requirements and latency. If you're at work during the day then can get a off-peak service for £40 or £50 a month and I'll bet that you won't find better ping times on *any* other ISP.

It's worth noting, if quantity is your an important metric, that A&amp;A give 1TB for a unit between 2am and 6am (i.e. only £4 for that much data, I think). If you use a scheduled BitTorrent client (deluge) and you're on fibre, that's perfectly usable - the cost of hard-drives would outweigh the bandwidth limitation. 

Like I said, I said this to make a point. One of my customers went from an ADSL connection (2mb - 3mb) with Eclipse to a fibre connection with BT Infinity and complained that web-pages loaded slower on the new BT fibre connection. It did not surprise me at all. He had the fibre put in on a second line, so he could switch between the two connections (different wifi networks) and the speed difference was quite obvious - BT's fibre infinity felt slower to him. This despite the fact that he could go to speedtest.net and it would show the 40mbps download speed that he'd been promised. So I think it's worth asking here, ""what does quality mean?""

You're right that A&amp;A don't show an unlimited tariff. If you were to phone them up, cash in hand then I'm pretty sure they'd sell it to you - it would just be ridiculously, prohibitively expensive. That wasn't the point I was trying to make.

Also, and don't read thus as a complaint as much as a vague ponderence, but is there any other show out there that cycles through it's main actors and characters as frequently as Doctor Who? I know that's kind just always been how the show works, but doesn't anyone think it's odd, in this era of strong, character-driven television stories, to have a show that periodically replaces *all* of the main actors and continues on under the same title? Again, not a complaint, but can you imagine if, on a season finale of How I met Your Mother, the characters got in a car crash, and all of them died except Ted, who had to undergo reconstructive therapy and as a result was now played by Jonah Hill and the series became about him making a completely new group of friends? People would riot!

I guess what I'm trying to say is if Rory dies I'm going to blow up the cast of How I Met Your Mother.

Then when the 45% rate kicks in in a years time the businesses will pay out their dividends etc. and the tax income will increase so the conservatives can claim that their economic policies have been successful just in time for the next election.

true,galenwolf,eng-manchester,Manchester - FOR SCIENCE!,"You need both.

Voting only works whilst the government allows it to happen and the population has a means of ensuring it happens without corruption and the parties involved deliver on what they promised. 
 Small parties do not have a chance to get into power because they do not have the numbers so you cannot purely rely on just going ""sod you cameron, i'll vote green!"" because even if everyone who could vote green did, the green party just doesn't have the man power to achieve an election victory.  Now you could try to get all the small parties as many votes as possible, but that would require impossible co-operation between every person in the country as to avoid over lap and even then people would disagree about which small party to vote for because these small parties have policies that are generally considered rather radical.

Take my little town, I could vote UKIP, Green, English Democrat, BNP and a few other tiny parties. However even in my own town people wouldn't agree on which small party to use to remove the big three. I like one of the very small parties and UKIP, but others would say Green is the way to go. I don't agree with that as the Greens will cut all Fusion research when realitisically is the power source that is going to provide enough power for us long term.

Therefore you need the public to have the tools to force the big parties to behave, and right now - they don't.

Right now in Russia there has been massive voter fraud, and people want a new election. Same with the USA and the GOP race. In the case of America, the problem is the amount of infomed people is small and the people have been successfully divide enough to stop any formation of a collective will between all sides. 

If you take, for example, the vote problems with florida with Bushes second term election win there was evidence of voter fraud but the government had successfully created an massive left/right gap the republicans cared more about ""their man"" getting in rather than the voter fraud.  Now at that time people where less aware of the danger they where in with their governments abuse of power. However even today with the fact there is evidence within the GOP election of fraud, people will not defend a uncorrupted vote and would rather dismiss it in the hopes of getting 'their man' to win even when the evidence shows that they will lie to get into office and then break all their election promises when it comes to returning liberty.

The vote doesn't magically create a democracy, it never has and never will.  An informed public that is armed and is willing to take action when their peaceful display of democracy is removed is the only true way to fully safeguard liberty as seen by various different regimes during the 20th century which in total killed 200,000,000+ inncoent people.

Interesting question, there are a few, but none that do it quite like Dr Who.

Most of the programmes that spring to mind are location-based soaps, particularly any childrens' shows (which often take place in schools so there are forced reasons for characters to leave) have the main cast replaced pretty regularly (from the UK I'm remembering Grange Hill and Byker Grove off the top of my head).  Other location-based soaps such as Neighbours/Eastenders/Coronation Street/... have a regular influx of new characters but change the 'core' set much less frequently.  The other programme that occurs is House given the somewhat transient nature of his 'team' whilst keeping the core of House himself and Wilson (and Cuddy to some extent).

As far as I'm aware though, Doctor Who is the only show that can actually change the *entire* cast in one fell swoop and still keep going successfully.

But I grew up in the Shires, and know how it is to have one bus an hour in each direction to connect your town with its neighbours. Most people _have_ to drive to get to work, and high petrol costs eat massively into your earnings.

Improving the public transport there just isn't all that viable without massive subsidies, and we've seen how that has worked on the privatised rail networks: the government gives £100m to a company as an agreed-upon contractual subsidy for poor passenger numbers, and yet the company makes a £500m profit on those who do actually travel! Fares have increased massively, and service really hasn't improved.

There needs to be a happy medium, and for me it does lean a bit too heavily in favour of the motorist right now.

You'd be surprised at how low your income has to be to get into the top 10%, 5%, 2% etc. There is a huge gulf between the really rich and the rest of us. The occupy movement has got the figure 1% stuck in our heads but in reality its closer to the 0.1% (or maybe even the 0.01%) 

I'm off to find facts so I'm not just talking outta my arse.

Edit: Here we go:-

Back in 2008
&gt;The average income of the top tenth, of £49,950, was double the average income of all taxpayers (£24,769) and triple that of all households (£15,000), one-third of whom pay no tax.

&gt;To get into the top 1%, an individual needed an income of £100,000, and to get into the top 0.1%, £350,000.

&gt;Those in the top 1% of the income distribution had an average income of £155,000, while the top 0.1% of taxpayers had an average income of £780,000.

&gt; ...

&gt; ...

&gt;According to IFS figures, anyone with an income of over £35,000 per year before tax was in the top 10% of taxpayers.



This is a particularly relevant bit...

&gt;It is also unclear how much an increase in the tax rate, for example to 50% for those earning over £100,000, would actually yield.

&gt;If tax rates went up, it is possible that the rich could change the way they received their income - or where they lived - in order to limit any gains for the Exchequer

&gt;However, the IFS point out that since the rich represent such a large proportion of income tax, if their income started to stagnate - for example as a result of another stock market fall - it would be bad news for government tax revenues.

true,Geofferic,essex,"Bloody Barkingside, Wot!","Very mixed bag.  50p drop is needed, but to 40p and only .5p per year and starting immediately.  The current plan is purely political bs.

The graduated childcare benefit is an improvement, but needs to start a 40k and drop at half the rate. 

The 10k untaxed earnings goal and acceleration is good, but needs to be more around 15k.

The scheme putting young people to work to keep their benefits was unaddressed (though they benefit from the untaxed income changes) and shamefully needs adjustment.  The pay rate is simply too low.

The pensions changes haven't gone far enough in one sense, but have gone too far in that they should not be affecting those already on or soon to be on pension.  These changes, tho too little in the long run, are cruelly and irresponsibly being foisted on those who are already in the system and many living cheque to cheque.  It's truly thievery.

The council tax benefit to soldiers is populist pandering of the worst sort, a waste of money, and falsely suggests that low-earning soldiers are more valuable to society than low-earning labourers.

The cigarette tax is purely an attack on the liberty of the poor, but this is what we can expect when we have a national health system.  There will be a sin tax on fried food, fast food and junk food soon.  Again, this is a purely regressive tax that will attack the liberty of the poor.

It is a shame we didn't hear about movement on the newer, safer, cheaper nuclear power front.  Bill Gates is presently bringing drastically cheaper, better, sustainable power to third world nation's and the UK is lagging behind.  Natural gas is fine, but is a stop-gap measure.  Let's hear about long term planning.

I could go on and on about this mixed bag.  20% tax on small business is still oppressive.  If that's the ultimate goal for multinational corporate tax rate (fine) how can it make sense for small businesses?

Bacteria and viruses, and this is what is used to attack healthy plants to get things from toxins like DDT and even fish DNA into our plants, if that isn't enough they are also putting anti-biotic markers that are resistant to anti-biotics in the plants as well.

We are not talking about naturally selecting plants, we are talking about invading the cell and implanting DNA that would never be able to naturally crossed with that plant.  Like flounder DNA in tomatoes to make them frost resistant for example.

The answer is to have as you said, ultra local services.

Towns should join to the next town, cities should join to the next city etc. These buses should be frequent and be 24 hour. They should be run by the local council of each village/town/city at cost.

true,alllie,null,null,"That's not true. Hitler hated and had contempt for the working class. He worked against them. Fascism was a movement AGAINST the working class. 

&gt;The examples of Mussolini's Italy, Hitler's Germany and Franco's Spain had shown all too clearly that fascism was, in essence, the counterrevolutionary political mobilization, in the interests of capitalism, of the enraged middle classes, the petty bourgeoisie, against the socialist labor movement. Where fascism came to power, the working class ceased to exist as an organized political and social force.

&gt;Himself [Hitler] a product of the lower middle class, he spent his formative years in Vienna, where his world view was shaped by the cheap right-wing gutter press and where he acquired his life-long hatred of the working class and socialism. Hitler's anti-Semitism was, according to the perceptive antifascist German writer Konrad Heiden, a by-product of his all-consuming hatred of the proletariat.

&gt;Hitler, Heiden explained, ""hated the whole great sphere of human existence which is devoted to the regular transference of energy into product; and he hated the men who had let themselves be caught and crushed in the process of production. All his life the workers were for him a picture of horror, a dismal gruesome mass ... everything which he later said from the speaker's platform to flatter the manual worker was pure lies.""

&gt;Herein lies the key to an understanding of Hitler's demonic obsession with the Jews. In Mein Kampf, Hitler explained how his conversion to anti-Semitism flowed from his encounters with the labor movement. It was among the workers that Hitler first came into contact with Jews. He then discovered, to his amazement, that many Jews played prominent roles in the labor movement. ""The great light dawned upon him,"" wrote Heiden. ""Suddenly the 'Jewish question' became clear.... The labor movement did not repel him because it was led by Jews; the Jews repelled him because they led the labor movement.""

&gt;One thing is certain, Heiden concluded.

I think you need to be realistic and understand that lots of the people taking on the loans are going to fail, but by going through the process the education gained is so much more valuable than a business degree or any other mickey mouse course and the failures will still help other small businesses. The thing that would be great is when potential entrepreneurs are able to club together their allowances and purchase real assets that work for a real a business that they would never normally have a chance of getting finance for. I would also expect the failures to end up employed by the successes as the skill sets would be well matched in many cases.More importantly it would set up a very valuable young business eco-system.

I think the whole 'millionaire's budget' thing is a bit stupid - it just seems like them attacking it because they are in opposition, it doesn't seem like they've done anything too terrible.

 I mean Labour didn't introduce the 50p rate for ages anyway, and they got rid of the lower band. Raising the personal tax allowance is good, perhaps they should have done more, faster, but I don't know how feasible that is. The bank levy is increasing which surprised me, and the increase in stamp duty, capping the relief (long overdue) and means testing child benefit and the General Avoidance Rule all seem quite progressive.

In general the budget has been quite good really. And I'm far from a Conservative supporter.

It's really important to be absolutely clear what the government is doing here – what they are doing, and the document confirms – they are cutting the taxes for 300,000 top-rate taxpayers. And it confirms the cost of that next year will be £3bn – they're giving £10,000 to every top-rate taxpayer.

They are gambling that if they give £10,000 to the richest people who currently pay tax, they'll somehow be able to recoup £2.9bn from people who currently aren't paying tax because they're offshore or avoiding tax.

The problem is there's no certainty they'll get that money. The actual tax cut to existing taxpayers is six times what they're raising on stamp duty and tax avoidance. Will they get this money in?

My only concern really is that with so many young people subscribing to the X-factor generation that some of the harder decisions you need to make when running your own business might not be taken as seriously as they might.

It is one thing to start up a business with your own money but another to take out a loan to do it.

I would like to have faith in the youth of today but as I have explained on another sub-reddit in the past my experiences so far leads me to question exactly what sort of education are our kids getting these days. What has been muddied these last years is the idea that degrees are the only path to jobs where in reality they are a myriad of different ways to become successful and only a few need the direct degree route. I speak from a generation whose peer group from uni all seemed to fragment far away from their training as soon as they hit the real world. Not that they did not become successful doing so just it is a wry topic among us about how useful our degree really was. For myself I learnt way more out of the lecture theatres than I ever did in them.

Anyway, let's see how this idea pans out. If it encourages more kids to look at alternatives ways to kick start a career I am all for it. Diversity is the spice of life after all.

Where as in the comic books he almost never loses his mask. That is due to the fact that in the comic book his mask is not static but rather dynamic, it moves with his emotions and dialog and story. However there is really no way to realistically display that functionality on the silver screen.

I'm sorry, but this is quite simply wrong. The latest EPR reactor, which is an evolutionary development of Gen III fission reactors, had development started in 1989, finished in 1998, and the first plant is scheduled to start operation in 2013. That's 24 years, and the EPR has been the major focus of Areva for decades, who spend $350m on research and development each year. Thorium would require a much more revolutionary change in reaction design, with serious safety issues which would have to be very carefully looked at (check out the problems associated with Pebble Bed and LFTR reactors), both by the research organization, and the government for approval. There is 0% chance of Thorium reactors running on the grid by 2020, let alone 2016, when the first coal stations shut down.

true,qwert_trewq,uk,Oxford,"If we're talking about politically shrewd but cynical moves, then let's talk about Brown raising the top tax bracket to 50p per pound in his last year in office when he had no chance of re-election, forcing the Tories to cut it back to where it'd been for years and to look like the bad guys. Top tax brackets around the world: Germany - 45%, France - 40%, Italy - 43%, USA - 45.55% (that's the top Federal rate plus the top state rate), Switzerland - 13.2%, Ireland - 41% etc (Spain and the Netherlands have 52 and Sweden has 57, in the interest of putting across both sides).

Lowering it to 45% brings it back into line with both what it'd been historically and with what similar countries are doing abroad, and it was only raised to 50% recently as a cynical political move. Osborne himself accepts and addresses that rich people tend to dodge tax, and that's a huge problem for him. Your point is valid - the figures will end up showing much more tax taken in when it's at 45p, but if you've realised this and can point it out, don't you think Milliband can manage the same (despite being a bit of a twerp)?

The biggest news here is the increase in personal allowance, which is great, and the increase in stamp duty for rich people is can hardly be accused of being the 'same old Tory'. As you seem to agree  with (from your post in another thread) there's a lot of good stuff here; I feel it's pretty neutral and balanced, and taxes on vices like smoking (always great) and the freezing of special personal allowance for old people seem like fairly clever ways to make money to me.",0,1332356004,null,0,true,0,c43fmsp,t3_r6ox8,t1_c43fmsp,t1_c43c69k,null,1428567678,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

The current umming and ahhing over terrible ideas like MOX and Fast Breeders is just another symptom of intransigent thinking, not the cause. 

What really needs to happen if we want to be totally behind the tech is for **EVERYONE** to be educated that it exists in the first place. Sadly many environmentalists hear the words nuclear and reactor and throw a wobbly, which is unfortunate as reactor designs like the LFTR could very well be the answer to all their concerns over sustainability of fuel sources, pollution and waste and minimising the impact of civilisation's effect on global warming. 

Bear in mind that the Manhattan project went from Zero to Hero in exceptionally short time and if there was the same sense of urgency about every worsening weather patterns, rising seas and global warming you can bet you life we'd have an operational reactor up and running in 5 years not 25.

It is all a matter of perspective and priorities. But if no one is pushing the envelope then nothing ever gets done.

My boyfriend and I had to move out of our flat 2 months before the lease was up (due to him getting a job in SE England on short notice), but we told them we would obviously still pay the rent and any bills. We could have just kept it quiet, but our lease stated that any absences longer than three weeks had to be reported. 

We had organised to visit friends in Edinburgh a month after we had moved out and figured we would just stay in the flat to save money. We got there and a man answered the door in his underwear and told us he had signed a lease the week before!

They assumed that we wouldn't be back to the flat and just let it to someone else, but still continued to take our money.

Their excuse was that they had misunderstood us when we told them we were moving out, and thought that we wanted them to put the flat back on the market. SUCH BULLSHIT. Even if that was true they are obligated to tell us whenever they had people in the flat to view it, and they should have told us when we were released from our contract. Not to mention they somehow missed the fact that they were magically getting £600 extra every month.

They refunded us the money they owed pronto, but they still had the cheek to charge us for cleaning expenses, despite the fact that we had left cleaning products there so I could give it a final once-over before we left for good. They paid that back too, eventually. They didn't pay for us to spend the night in a Travel Lodge though.

You're not taking into account any of the points I have raised and are not refuting the fact that this is a truly meh budget that has served to benefit the rich and prove that we are not 'all in it together'. The cutting of the 50p rate appears utterly stupid and the arguments put forth by Osborne for doing so are looking ropey. You've skirted over so much (that people are and will be paying more for services in the future as one example and the implications of the Health Bill being another- notice that is pensioners taking two hits in two days) and not even bothered to look for any deeper analysis. Truly amazing that you consider this to be a great budget. Even Miliband was able to trash him afterward!

&gt;He also managed to puncture the grandiosity of a Chancellor claiming, with scant evidence, to be honouring Adam Smith's four economic canons. In a series of crisp putdowns, he nailed the crux of the unfairness in this Budget. Can it be right that the poor will only work harder if you make them poorer, while the reverse applies to the very rich?

&gt;Where's the HMRC 50p tax report? Doesn't link through off Treasury website...

http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2012/03/21/the-key-economic-assumptions-osborne-is-making-are-wrong-which-means-he-cant-balance-his-books/

&gt;But the weirdest assumption of all is that business will invest massively more? Why will they do that? Their customers – whether here, or the government, or abroad – are all going to be consuming less but it’s assumed business will invest substantially more. That is utterly implausible. They just aren’t that irrational. They want a return before they invest – and since this forecast clearly says none will be forthcoming then that isn’t going to happen.

http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2012/03/21/the-obr-data-confirms-my-estimates-of-tax-to-be-raised-by-the-50p-tax-rate-were-right/

&gt;Sticking to the facts it should have raised £5.7 billion in 2010/11 which is consistent with my estimate of £6.7 bn in 2011/12 and I therefore maintain my figures to be right and that my estimate of the loss from introducing the 45p tax rate – which will be about £3 billion – is also right.

&gt;On the one hand, the budget announced a £10bn cut in the welfare budget, while saying that families with incomes of £45,000 to £60,000 will not see child benefit cut line with previous announcements. Whatever government may say about all being in it together, governments always look after their own.

&gt;George Osborne has made a basic blunder that sends a missile into six years of Tory modernisation. At a time of austerity, fear and difficulty for so many people, he has sent a message that the government is – to quote Ed Miliband – more concerned with millionaires than millions of hard-working families.

Aside from rail investment and the breaks for the Video Game industry/creative media (which were Labour's initiatives that he had scrapped in his first budget) it has been a poor and there is no disguising that, especially considering how much was still ""under consultation"".
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/rogerbootle/9158844/Budget-2012-The-real-point-of-the-Budget-was-to-keep-the-Coalition-together.html

&gt;Moreover, on many of the juicier bits of the Budget the government is still in consultation: an annual charge on properties worth over £2m held in companies (a mansion tax-lite); pension funds investing in infrastructure; the introduction of a general anti-tax avoidance rule; the integration of tax and national insurance. 

So to say it once more (with feeling), this has been a poor, unfair budget. Unless you're rich. Then it is mother's milk.",0,1332360786,null,0,false,0,c43gppm,t3_r6nsg,t1_c43gppm,t1_c43fwvs,null,1428568179,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

true,randomguy634,welsh,London,"Sorry, my comment was intended as just a bit sarcastic venting (I get quite annoyed when people call countries like the USSR, China or even Cuba -a state I actually admire to a certain extent - communist).

You see, communism, as described by Marx, is a stateless, egalitarian society, where money doesn't exist and the workers control the means of production. In an actual communist society there would be little if any regulation of the economy; true communism is, in fact, a free market, there's just no ownership of property.

Now, in Marxist-Leninist theory, it's believed that the best way to achieve a communist society, is via a socialist state, where the workers control the means of production, but the state manages other aspects of society, such as welfare, education, defense etc. 

Now, the United Soviet Socialist Republic, was not socialist. It wasn't a republic, nor was it soviet (whereby the workers take control of their working lives by forming unions called soviets) either. It was, in fact, a state capitalist society: the state owned the means of production, not the workers. (Incidentally, the Bolsheviks had no pretensions about this - even Lenin said it was state capitalist.) I cannot think of a single revolution that set out to establish a socialist state that didn't fail.

Most communists today (at least of my generation) are syndicalists. They reject the notion of a transitory socialist state, and that of the vanguard party (the political party that unites the workers and establishes a socialist state). Instead, they envisage the majority of the revolution being carried by the workers themselves, through forming co-ops and unionising into 'locals', unions organised on anarchist principles (similar to soviets). Instead of viewing the state as the Big Bad Wolf, it is the corporations who bear the brunt of syndicalists' wrath. The transition of political power is much less important than the transition of economic power; we already have some political power through representative democracy - the great gift of capitalism, it only became possible thanks to the capitalist revolution that freed us from feudalism.

So, 'communist' countries are not communist, nor socialist (unless the workers own the means of production). Marxism-Leninism isn't very popular anymore. And most communists and anarchists nowadays are more concerned with gaining economic power than political power.",0,1332364697,null,0,false,0,c43hjuy,t3_r6jl6,t1_c43hjuy,t1_c43g7jv,null,1428568574,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I live in a fairly prosperous town in the south east, so maybe the ""middle class islands in poorer areas"" doesn't apply here. 

I found this quote quite telling: ""A faith character is often taken to be a signal of a good or successful school. Once that happens, the process will be self-sustaining in the Darwinian world of modern education, where schools must compete for success or die""

I guess a faith school self selects for parents who either have a faith or are interested in giving their kids a good education. In the same way, a good community school will push house prices up, self selecting for parents who either have money or are interested in giving their kids a good education.

Down in Brighton they allocate school places using a lottery. This eliminates self selection altogether, but I worry that this drops standards to the lowest common denominator. Not to mention that it means kids are bussed all over the city rather than going to their nearest school which might be in walking distance.

Brighton is interesting - I've never heard of that method but it sounds pretty fair. I'm not sure about the LCD aspect though as I think the lottery would result in the fairest system over all. There are always going to be disruptive pupils due to health or social issues, but I wouldn't have thought there'd ever be 'enough' to fill a school. Even if there were, it's not set in stone that a child will be a 'bad' pupil for the full five years of secondary school, say. Deciding that a kid isn't good enough to go to the 'better' school would be incredibly demoralising and effectively write the kid off from age 11 - speaking only of secondary schools.

How can anyone accurately predict, every time, how well a pupil will do through out their compulsory school life?

Smoking isn't about the act. It's almost always about a lack of consideration for others. The fact that littering cigarette butts is somehow acceptable. That non-smokers don't matter - and smokers get aggressive about their rights to antagonise others.

Drogba gave up possession at least four or five times by my count up until injury time and half-assed it when he did get the ball. Essien wasn't the worst substitution but why did he put his hands up?

Bosingwa? I don't think I need to say a word about Bosingwa except that it was quite a Bosingwa performance.

At least Liverpool lost to QPR. Not a real concern right now to me as far as the table goes but I like seeing relegation-threatened teams beat the Reds.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"It's pretty painful at first. I used wifeinspace.com blog to aid me in the earliest days. It's hilarious to read- a husband and wife go through the classic series and the wife isn't a fan. Eventually if you watch nothing else for hours on end (as I did) you become desensitized and forget that color tv exists. Then you start comparing how good the episodes are to each other instead of to modern day tv. At first I wouldn't have described any of the stories as *good* because I couldn't get past the slow boringness, but then, as you are forced to pay closer attention to the not-overly-dramatized emotions of the actors, you pick up on more stuff.

And the moment you get to the second Doctor, you notice an immediate increase in general quality. And them once you get to the third Doctor, you're in the easy stretch as that's when you get color tv and modern camera editing techniques.

But the first two Doctors, yeah, they can get tough. Especially all of Troughton's missing episodes.

For me, cheesiness wasn't really a problem (a couple stories did make me laugh in disbelief). I can't tell if the acting is bad, if Daleks are cardboard cutouts, or how cheesy something is relative to its decade. I'm so culture blind (apparently) that it's made me totally oblivious.

I remember one story- Edge of Destruction, which I thought was boring except for one scene with Hartnell giving an enigmatic speech at the end. After finishing classic I went back and exclaimed something like, ""Omg how could I have thought that nobody on this show emotes! Look how sweet their interactions are!""

Then slowly increase renewables (Severn barrage, wind, solar) up towards the gas generation capacity of about 55%, by 2040. That will give you another 30% cut on CO2, and you can top up to 80% with energy efficiency.

A better sub would have been Sturridge on for Lamps, or even for Meireles a lot earlier, so Daniel could pump runs, pushing Torres into the middle more. 

Before we dwell on Bosingwa for too long, can we observe the ongoing failings of his international partner? Meireles has been terrible for us. He was pretty good at Liverpool at times, but nothing that special. For us he as been absolutely poor. For all the criticism that Torres has got for his barren run, consider Meireles. Torres may have gone over 24 hours of football without scoring, but he played well enough for quite a few of those games, racked up the assists and gave his all. Meireles is always just slightly out of position... pinging shots to row z... playing a fantastic pass to some phantom player.

http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/qcpf4/business_leaders_call_for_50p_top_tax_rate_to_be/c3wl6d1

&gt;This Laffer/Friedman guff again, it comes around every year and yet the treasury estimate (irc) is that the rate will bring in £5bn a year. Personally, I'm no fan of the Laffer curve (you've probably guessed that referring to Laffer as 'guff!) and especially not of the idea that it is a fixed point after which revenues will drop and businesses shrink/depart/world explodes. It'd be better to keep the 50p (or add a slight raise for the very high earners) rate and get on with cracking down on abusive avoidance schemes (like, e.g., Norway).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rates_of_Europe

Laffer and the 50p rate :

http://www.answers.com/topic/smoot-hawley-tariff

&gt;At a party in the late 1970s—or so the story goes—economist Arthur Laffer used a cocktail napkin to sketch an upside-down U that became the basis for an entire movement in economic policy. The Laffer Curve, as the U came to be known, represented the theory that as taxes went down, government revenue would actually go up, as lower taxes would stimulate the economy and provide more receipts. Laffer's theory was adopted as part of Ronald Reagan's platform in his 1980 presidential campaign, and after he became president, Reagan pushed through the largest package of tax cuts in history. Counter to his expectations, the deficit mushroomed, and Laffer's theory was discredited. While most scholars agreed that a budget deficit would grow by slightly less than the full amount of a tax cut, because some economic growth would result, credible economists from across the political spectrum agreed that the net effect would be negative. During the 1980 presidential primaries, Reagan's opponent George H. W. Bush had ridiculed his theories as ""voodoo economics."" Twenty years later, Bush's son, President George W. Bush, promoted another package of enormous tax cuts, arguing that they would stimulate the economy, government receipts would increase, and the budget gap would be closed. Bush's detractors, who viewed the maneuver as blatant pandering to wealthy constituents, called it voodoo economics all over again.

http://leap-lrc.blogspot.com/2012/02/having-laffer.html

&gt;However, the Laffer Curve is not a tool solely of the right. Toby Young - a man whose knowledge and arrogance seem to have an inverse relationship - obviously hasn't read much about the Laffer Curve. If he had he might not be advocating a 70% taxation rate. That according to Mathias Trabandt &amp; Harald Uhlig in 'How far are we from the slippery slope: The Laffer Curve revisited' is the income tax rate after which revenues start declining.

and

&gt;So, if we could effectively cap salaries at £300,000 (and therefore also reduce the ridiculous pension pots to the super-rich) that money could then be spent more productively - on research and development, or improving the wages or working conditions of general employees. Then the right would cry that British business could not compete. But the German Commerzbank caps its top pay at 500,000 euros or £416,000 - about one-third of what Stephen Hester will receive as his basic salary, even without his now defunct bonus.

http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2011/09/07/should-the-50p-tax-rate-be-abolished/

&gt;It’s also true that while the UK undoubtedly needs tax cuts to stimulate the economy, a cut in the 50% tax rate is probably the least likely to do this. Cutting it will boost savings, of which we already have a glut, or house prices in the south-east, which are already too high. There’s little or no chance it will stimulate spending.

&gt;Nor will it boost entrepreneurship, which is about people taking risks and creating companies. Most people earning £150,000 a year do neither. They speculate for banks and pension funds using other people’s money (where, let it be noted, most have been so successful that their average rate of return in the last decade has been about zero at best) or they rise through the ranks of multinational corporations, enjoying secure employment and large pensions until appointed to positions where they can distort pay and rewards in their own favour. As a result their main contribution to society is, in fact, to increase the income and wealth gaps, which we know produces worse outcomes for all.

&gt;So that’s not entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship which leads to growth, new business and new jobs is done in small companies by people who often work for long periods for nothing (and so pay little or no tax). Their income is usually sheltered in companies – and those companies only pay tax at about 20%. The 50% tax rate is no disincentive to real entrepreneurship.

http://taxjustice.blogspot.com/2012/02/itep-debunks-loopy-laffer-again.html

&gt;So how, exactly, did Laffer get it wrong? It's very simple, really. Laffer's findings were caused by population growth in the high-growth states, not by economic growth stimulated by tax cuts (and incidentally, that population growth had nothing to do with tax cuts either). And that's it, really. There are a few other factors, too: some of the states, for instance, were able to afford tax cuts because they had large natural resource windfalls.

http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2011/09/07/fisking-the-demand-to-cut-the-50p-tax-and-showing-it-for-what-it-is/

&gt;And oh dear, there really is a big error in the claim made: to suggest that talent and remuneration is correlated is, shall we say, just a little bit of an error? There are extraordinarily talented people in this country making a lot less than £150,000 a year. Most of those who are making £150,000 are either in finance (making sure that pensions funds have generated no net return for their members over the last decade or more, for example – one of the weirdest definitions of growth I know and and also one of the strangest definitions of talent) or are in senior management of major multinational corporations where there is no proven link between talent and return

Tax gap and tax avoidance:

&gt;First, full marks to the government for taking action: credit where it is due.

&gt;Second, this shatters the myth that voluntary codes with people like banks work.

&gt;Third, this also shatters the CBI’s claim that only the most egregious tax abuse schemes need be covered by a general anti-avoidance principle. The scope needs to be far wider.

&gt;Fourth, it supports my long held view that the tax gap is created by this type of activity and not a few R&amp;D and capital allowance claims as the CBI and the right wing like to claim.

But, looking back at the whole match, I think there are definitely some positives we can pull out of the wreckage.  They may be meaningless because we lost, we fucking blew it, but they are positives nonetheless.  4th was a distant possibility anyway, and after nine more games, everybody's record resets to zeroes; I'm hoping what good I saw in this game will translate into long term performances.

The game up until Kuyt's goal, and even for a little bit after, was fucking fantastic.  Liverpool played some of the best football I've seen in a while: that one-touch pass and move in the opening minutes was absolutely top notch, fucking Barca quality.  The midfield linked up with each other, and got forward and into the box for a change.  We were hammering the living shit out of QPR.  Downing showed well, Kuyt worked his ass of as usual, Suarez was brilliant, Gerrard was magical, Jay was playing solidly, Enrique was tearing shit up, and Skrtel was being his usual monster self.  The Coates goal was indescribably absolutely totally fucking **sublime**.  When Kuyt got his, there was a sense of inevitability: it was only a matter of time before Liverpool got their second.  For the first time this season I honestly enjoyed watching Liverpool play from an aesthetic standpoint, and I can say I'm happy with that, and hope that kind of play becomes the norm in the future.

I won't go on about the collapse.  Enough people have lamented their hearts out about it here, and one more post about it won't be particularly helpful.  We all saw it; it sucked.  Fuck everything.

No team has beaten City at Etihad this season and to have led them there is great for our squad regardless of the result. Arsenal couldn't score at City at all.

As an obsessive fan, I never understood how continuity errors could possibly happen in TV, figuring the creators of the show would remember their canon even better than a fan.

 The problem is, during off-season time like now, people are struggling to find new/relevant info, so they post other stuff instead.

true,TomShoe,1972crest,,"I know this thread is kind of dead, and this comment is only loosly related, but this seems like a good oppurtunity to sharenmy perspective. I'm from Omaha Nebraska, which for those of you not super familiar with US geography, is literally right in the center of the country. I started following soccer in late 2008. At first I was a united fan, because they were really good in FIFA 09, but the more Impayed attention to the league, the less I liked them, and I converted to the rivals, towards the end of that season. My cousin from Minnesota, who plays, and is insanely good, had been a fan for a while. I think he picked them for no other reason than that they had an interesting, if sometimes tragic history, and a lot of heart.  Any way, I already had a soft spot for city because of this (clearly I was never a true united fan), so this and my dislike of united, made it a natural move. I started watching the games religiously about a couple months into the 09/10 season, I think around the time sheik means our took over, but before mark hughes was sacked, when my cousin made me aware of fox soccer channel, and ever sense then, I watch every game that I can, (games are on in the morning/mid day hear, so given that I'm only 16, i miss FA cup and UEFA games because I'm in school) and have the homepage bookmarked on my computer. my whole family took an interest around the same time as I did. My younger brother supports united to be a contrarian, and my dad likes arsenal, because he read Fever Pitch, by Nick Hornby. People in the US aren't really born into supporting a club, we kind of have to pick our own, which accounts for the discrepancy. I pride myself on picking a club that wasn't doing great at the time, instead of one of the big four at the time. Back when I started paying attention the team was very different, and I've watched it grow and evolve as I've followed it, so I feel really attached to this squad, to the point where I sometimes refer to it as 'my team'. I'm not sure if this is considered acceptable over there, butchered it gets me derided sometimes by less adamant fans. I also own three city shirts. 09/10 Robinho home, (I'll sell it some day for a fortune) 10/11 Hart away, and 11/12 Silva home. My family went to England last year, but it was in the summer, and we only went to London and Cornwall, so to answer the original question, no, I have never been to a game, and would love the oppurtunity.

true,dopqob,null,null,"Hey look, it's a difference of opinion. About a television series. I'm sorry it made you upset but regarding this and your other response, you can be civil about it. 

My opinion is that deleting the topics after discussion had already begun was unnecessary because non-plot related info is not a spoiler. I would have actually preferred that nobody put that stuff in the title in the first place, since it would have avoided all these issues. But still, I think deleting them after the fact was an overreaction considering there's already a lack of proper discussion in this sub. Nobody forces you to go in and talk about it, and nobody forces you to look up info on an actress/actor based off seeing their name. But deleting a topic and therefore preventing access to a comment thread that has already begun *does* force people to stop participating in that thread. They are then forced to splinter into new threads that don't get the exposure of the primary one, and the discussion suffers because of that.

I'm sorry that you disagree with that opinion, but I tried to express it without hostility. I expect other people to do the same.

Edit: For the record, I think new monsters definitely count as spoilers, and I suppose filming locations do as well, to a lesser extent. But to have it extend to an actress' name I think was a bit ridiculous.

true,Sjreed,null,null,"When you say reason, I presume you mean left wing ideology? Sure and 50% higher rate is not the norm, there are plenty of developed countries that have rates that are drastically lower such as Singapore, New Zealand, Switzerland and Canada, as well as a few that have higher than 50% but 40-45% is a fairly average. 

I don't support it blindly as the be all and end of solutions. I think it's a suitable tool to be used in certain situations like the States as their social system is in tatters and they have the dollar which is the worlds currency reserve. But they are going to have to cut back sooner or later as the deficit they are running is not sustainable. I agreed with it in the U.K after the crash, but it probably wouldn't help Greece or Italy. 

But it's just that, a stimulus, it does very little to address the structural problems of needing to rebalance the economy from the unsustainable model of growth we've previously had which relied on retail, banking, public sector, house prices and debt. The harsh reality is that the rest of world has been catching up with us while we were binging on the credit cards. 
As for trying it in the U.K now I think it would improve growth figures slightly, maybe add a % point until it run out, but then our borrowing rates would increase as a result, mortgage rates would rocket, house prices would plummet, lots of people would have to lose their houses like they did in the States and we would risk entering a death spiral and needing to go to the IMF for a bailout. 

The positive effects of the 50p rate and corporation tax are the same benefits from any tax take the government receives, but they don't make us competitive internationally, or encourage business to relocate here they do the opposite.

I think we have lots of highly skilled people here, but that does not negate the fact that other places have more that we can benefit from. The importance of America in my opinion is that most rapid growth start-ups (is just an example, but would apply to other sectors) that reach the size of facebook, google, paypal ect need a European base. At the moment they choose Ireland or Switzerland. I'd rather they were choosing us and tax levels pay a large part in that.

I don't think the Government have got everything right, but at least the solutions they are offering are attempting to balance the economy in the right direction.
I agree they should be doing more for SME's and start-ups, but as someone that follows and hopes to join the U.K start-up scene, I can assure you that it's getting there and they are doing a lot of things that I agree with such as SEIS, Tech city, Broadband infrastructure, enterprise zones to name few.

It seems to me he has been played out of position all year.  When at Newcastle he was a huge reason Andy Carroll was so good, because of his amazing crosses. Seems he was deployed as a RM or LM (can't remember which), but at QPR he is consistently played in the middle, where he is just not as effective.  I would like to see him take a shot at goal too.  It seems all the hate he gets may be actually getting to him and that's sad to me.

I also feel that he is trying to calm down a bit thus why you don't see his tackling nearly as often.  Due to his rep he has a good chance of being carded despite how fair the tackle was, that I feel is good thinking.  I think Joey is a good player, and to tell ya the truth I'd love to have him at Liverpool.

I know there were some interesting titles talking about [spoiler](/s ""Sophia Myles and her rumoured return to the show."")

So if you want to be vigilant about spoilers about casting details, you will have to introduce a script that treats spoiler posts (mainly about leaks or casting) as nsfw. 

Be warned, I am going to go into my rant about the general spoiler policy that has creeped up all over reddit. 

There has been one sub that handled spoilers properly, including cast leaks, as that show the cast list really did introduce spoilers. And that was r/lost. 

&gt;Do not post spoilers in the title.

&gt;Posts that refer to an episode should contain the season+episode# in the title (e.g [6x03])

&gt;Please be considerate and use logic when discussing key plot elements 

EDIT: Should be noted, as the show has ended for quite some time, no one is required to use spoilers there anymore. 

Full explanation can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/lost/comments/be7kz/rlost_spoiler_rules/).

No bullshit about airdates or what was considered spoilers. Every post had an episode or season tag, [s06], [s03], [s04e22], [s05e14], along with good practice to put in general what was going to be put into the title - again, don't put spoilers in the title. And you know what happened, people in the comments used common sense when using the spoiler tags, and people just visiting the sub for the first time were not spoiled just by looking at some of the thread titles. I am looking at you [spoiler](/s ""Melody Pond reveal.""). And hey look, all this shit about season 7, would enforce a [s07] tag for all of these or use [spoiler] specifically for unaired discussion, or as was finally implemented, a difference between SPOILER, and BIG SPOILER. And suddenly, by using proper tags, people knew specifically what to hide under a spoiler tag. There was still a backlash because some folks didn't want to use vague language or spoiler tags, probably why in other places the 48 hour rule got introduced. I think this doesn't handle leaks properly and isn't friendly to newcomers as a show is airing. We are supposed to help people get introduced to Doctor Who, or so I personally feel. 

Let's just say I have reservations about the 48 hour rule for those of us that either use DVDs, or live in a different country. I know Doctor Who actually changed how it treats its releases. But that difference of one week encouraged people across the pond to torrent, as otherwise they would be a week behind in the discussion. 

As an aside, [Game of Thrones](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/hvg3r/spoiler_policy_for_rgameofthrones/) is also pretty clear. And if we ever want to have classic series spoilers, here again, another example of multiple spoiler tags.

Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show that has been going on (in some form) since 1963 to now. The 50th anniversary is next year. It's about an alien known as the Doctor who has adventures through time and space. He brings humans/companions along with him to see alien worlds and history. We've had approximately 784 episodes (32 seasons) but you don't need prior knowledge for nearly all 780. You can jump in nearly anywhere.

The actor portraying the Doctor changes every few years. We've had 11 Doctors. The in-show explanation is that he is an alien and when he dies he can 'regenerate' his body into a new one.

The show is very diverse in tone, style, and subject matter. Which means that there's always one story/Doctor/season that a you will like. Don't like the eleventh Doctor? Try the tenth! Also, Doctor Who's classic series ran from 1963-1989 (seasons 1-26) then relaunched in 2005 (seasons 27-32/series 1-6).

But by no means do I suggest you start at 1963- it's good, but there's no point in making introduction to a show more difficult (unless you like old tv). You should choose the 2005 point.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

And no matter what you do, watch all six series. And if you like them, there's always classic who... :D",0,1332394439,null,0,false,0,c43mzj5,t3_r7z17,t1_c43mzj5,t3_r7z17,null,1428571213,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,faswich,cyberman,Cyberperson,"Anyway, the 48 hour is just a personal rant. And frankly, Doctor Who really doesn't encourage the same level of meticulous detail when it comes to sorting theories based on aired episodes, alternate reality games, legitimate spoilers from leaked documents, including casting documents. Plus the user base here is much more focused on images and swag then in depth discussion. Then again, the Doctor Who itself is meant so that someone's kid can accurately deduce where the plot is going, which if I remember, has happened. 

In the end, it is more important to have a clear protocol. 

If you want to find some fun reading, I recommend asking the mods over at [The Last Airbender](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/) about spoilers, leaked episodes and the distinct disconnect between those who are waiting and those that couldn't. It is why I had my r/lost spoiler rant more or less up and ready, I wrote the same thing there. And it is why the the image idea is stuck in my head. Over there, no nsfw posts are allowed, so by incorporating a modified CCS, the nsfw tag is actually used as a spoiler button, which is meant to hide the images, as a lot of great moments were captured in memes after the leak.

With this being a new area there is very limited skilled people but a student who has just finished a PHD from MIT on the subject is looking for work and is in high demand, 3 companies are desperate to recruit him (one French, one Australian and U.K) to help develop the products that can be first on the market and gain competitive advantage over the other two companies. He's decides to come to the U.K and 3 months later the company wins it's first contract with Bundesbank in Germany, the company needs to take 6  more experienced developers (from the U.K). Product is built and 3 more orders come through (other two countries are still looking for an algorithm specialist) 6 developers becomes specialists and start training graduates. One specialist gets offered a contract with Australian company and decides it's a good career opportunity and moves over. This whole situation gives the U.K company a massive first mover advantage due to being appealing to high earning foreign worker and bringing him in.

There is no way I could drink everyday (for the last 15-20 yrs) in the same way I consume cannabis and still have a successful job/relationship...

Alcohol destroys people - I watched it ruin my step dad's life (and his liver).

My point was that it is unfair that a substance that does less harm (or at least has the possibility of doing less harm) is not legally available whilst a substance that does so much harm to society and to health is o.k

No I don't consider consuming cannabis a problem for me - the worst side effect of not having it is maybe not sleeping as well - unlike alcohol cannabis is in no way physically addictive.  I met up with friends last night, we normally have a smoke/drink on wens night (mid week fun..) 

I do know what it is like to be addicted to something I gave up cigs after about 20 years smoking last April - I have not had one drag of tobacco since - I look far healthier and no longer have a cough at all (even though I still frequently smoke weed) - in this example the legal drug (tobacco) was harming me - the fact that I used to have a persistent chesty cough and now don''t proves this - I can also run more that 1 min without  getting a stitch now.

First of all, when we moved into the flat it was a fucking state.  The toilet was broken, it hadn't been cleaned at all, there was even a bottle of yellow liquid in one of the rooms (couple that with the broken toilet...)

During our two years there, we massively improved the flat.  We painted walls and doors that needed painting (with his permission, of course), we got a professional carpet cleaner in to do all the carpets, we told him about everything that needed repairs - the boiler broke frequently, the windows weren't windproof (there was a sizeable gap between the frame of one window and the wall), the drains were fucked, there was an enormous mouse infestation (we found mouse skeletons behind the sofa), bugs everywhere.  

We also had him turn up on the doorstep a fair few times with no notice.  Once, we had a group of friends round, and we were about 10 minutes away from leaving the flat for a big night out.  There's a knock on the door, and the landlord is there with a plunger, saying he's come to fix the drains and he needed us to help him with it.  When we were moving out, he also sent people round to view the flat without telling us.  That was awkward.

Honestly, we only moved in because we were 2nd year students, had no experience of landlords or flats outside of the university accommodation, and it was cheap rent.

After all that, we didn't even get our full deposits back, for completely bullshit reasons.  When I began to question Mr Ghafoor on the phone about the missing money from my deposit, he got very aggressive.

They won't really notice because of the increase in personal allowance.

**edit** to save me having to come back and do this later. Any one being pulled into 40% tax bracket will still be at least 117.50 better off each year. That is the amount extra that someone currently on 42,475 (the upper limit of 20p tax) will see from 2013.

**edit 2** just to add some more figures. The people at the top end of the 20p bracket who will get pulled into the 40p bracket are those earning between 41,450 and 42,475. Those on 41,450 will still see an increase of 220 quid a year. For every £10 extra they earn up to the 42,475 they will see £1 less on the 220 quid until they hit 42,475 and only see 117.50 increase. Those earning above 42,475, i.e. already in the 40p band, will see an increase of 118.40.

I never expected a top 4 finish this season, I guess we can take comfort in European play next season, and hopefully pick up that FA cup trophy as well. The season overall though has been somewhat disappointing, yes we are ""rebuilding"", but we have after all splashed a good deal of money on players. Hopefully, with a good long summer, with no injuries in the Euro, the players will come back to Anfield with a fire up under their asses. 

As an aside, going to Anfield on april 22 to see Liverpool play West Brom, I've had a bad record with teams like that, I went to Liverpool Wigan last year, 1-1, then against Sunderland in this seasons opener, 1-1, hopefully the players will somehow know and give me a great performance to make up for it.

We're taking one absolute axiom - if you don't tax, you generate no tax revenues.  The opposing side, if you take 100% tax, nobody, or the overwhelming majority of people, would not want to work is not necessarily as much an axiom; genuine altruism may mean someone is willing to work. However, it's significantly likely that it would be irrelevant.

The consensus would be that you would generate no tax at all at either end of the tax scale, but there isn't really any basis to say it has to be a curve or even a line. There's too many variables to pin it to just the taxation rate; for example, those on a lower income may be totally incapable of avoiding tax through legal means due to costs or apathy. Apathy regarding taxation would alter the figures dramatically.

The only real other axiom regarding taxation is that everyone would rather have more income at their disposal. Towards that end, a significant percentage of people would prefer to say that less tax would mean they'd be willing to pay more.

To be honest I'm pretty much on the fence with the health bill, I don't massively oppose it, but can't say I'm overly enthusiastic about it either. I think the reorganisation is going to be troublesome for a few years until it is familiar and the teething problems are ironed out, but generally don't disagree with GP based commissioning. The competition aspect can offer some goods benefits and I think healthcare in general could benefit from some fresh ideas in service, innovation and structure which would likely get suffocated before ever seeing the light within the current system.

On the other side the risks are quite obvious and nobody, myself included wants to see profiteering, monopolies, or service suffering as a result of the changes. I'm fine with people making money of it if it stays free, waiting times drop massively and the outcomes improve and I think there are plenty of new ways of providing healthcare which could achieve this. I have no interest in seeing the changes fail, so like to look on the bright side and hope for the best for everyone.

The way you posed your question is massively loaded, using positive terms like ""equip"" and ""discuss"" when talking about increasing the availability of guns, and  the negative connotations of ""rely"" when talking about maintaining gun control. 

Obviously as a sports shooter you understand that guns, like many things, have uses that aren't detrimental and can be safe in a certain environment, but adopting a ""more American"" model is lunacy. The rate of gun crime is just insane in America, and the old defense of criminals getting guns regardless of their legality is bunk. Sure, there are some illegal guns in the UK, but not nearly as many (per capita) as in the U.S. There are so many illegally owned guns around in america because they are a by product of a high level of supply of legal ones. They get stolen, their serial numbers defaced, and resold.

Take the UK, with its populace who largely wouldn't consider owning a gun even if it was legal, and then make guns more available, and you end up with a non-gun-owning populace and criminals siphoning firearms off the legal supply to their own end.

Rules: I am giving away 5 separate stickers to 5 separate people.

Rather than just make it random, what I want is to see *where* you'd put the sticker, so post a pic of your intended stickering spot, and I will pick the 5 I find most entertaining. Note: I can't *officially* condone you putting these on road signs or other property that is not your own, so please leave those out of this.

I am making this post at 11AM Eastern Time on Thursday. I'll pick the winners from entries submitted by 11AM my time on Saturday, March 24th. If people want to help things along by upvoting their own favourites, I will take that into consideration but I still reserve the right to make the final decision.

If you want to get a bunch of these stickers rather than wait to try to win 1, here's the link:

He has blamed luck in front of goal too often, and its his own fault, he should have brought a striker in, he saw how badly we were struggling in front of goal, it didnt have to be a world beater, or even a full transfer, he could have loaned someone in, or even just started playing his only actual proper striker.He just seemed to ignore there being a problem then too.

BT Group does not have a monopoly on the country's cable infrastructure. BT OpenReach is in effect, a separate entity and rents out the network to companies such as Virgin, Sky, and yes, BT Group. This has been done, naturally to ensure fair competition between them. 

Personally, though I would love to see faster BB, as I'm sure everyone else would, and I do agree more should be done to work towards it-I find it hard to really fault BT in their operations.

It is as if you're tunnel visioned. Do you not see him when we scored in that game? When was the last time you saw a manager jump around and turn immediately to the fans when their team scores?

There's just so much wrong with your comment I don't know where to begin. I mean... Daglish was there throughout Hillsborough, he met the families, he spent his life at Liverpool. He begged for the job and left his holiday cruise the moment he got the call. Luggage still left on the cruise ship.

But no, we should sack him for lack of passion because he didn't roar at Carragher and didn't make a fuss when they opposition scored. 

PS* Daglish would manage this club without a pay check.

But limiting what kind of firearms people can own has always seemed silly to me. If you can't trust someone with a semi-automatic rifle or hand gun, should you really be trusting them with a firearm at all? all guns are dangerous.

Tragedies like Hungerford and Dunblane possibly could have been prevented with the enforcement of existing laws, but we have to ask can we ever prevent such rare killing sprees, our current laws didn't prevent the shootings in Cumbria about a year and a half ago.

Other things to consider is whether someone should have the right to own a gun in their home and use it for the purposes of self defence, in areas of the country where the police could be up to half an hour away, although you could argue that crime is rare enough in these areas that it is not needed. And whether we should legalise sporting pistols as our olympic team must travel to northern ireland, the Isle of Man or the channel islands to practice.

true,ventusvir,null,null,"Actually, there's a long story behind that. You see, the female was going through difficult times with her family. Her father was caught cheating on her mother and the impact of this betrayal was colossal and devastating to her family. The girl, who we will call ""Emily,"" felt as her world was shattered. She fell into a deep depression over this issue and her mother didn't know how to handle this situation. So the mother let her be, allowing her to sort her problems on her own. Emily, having no friends to comfort her, turned to the internet. Using the laptop she received for Christmas, she found relief in science-fiction television programs. One day, she stumbled upon the british sci-fi show, ""Doctor Who."" She fell head over heels over it. After all, why wouldn't this show appeal to her? A strong, intelligent protagonist who sweeps people off their once ordinary lives to travel the universe and have marvelous adventures with. Perfect escapism for a child who could not cope with the divorce of her parents. Her love for the show was so that she would often daydream in class that the Tardis would magically appear in her classroom and the doctor would appear, begging her to go with her, for the fate of the world lies with her. One day, she was in a particularly deep daydream about a particularly exciting adventure. She and the Doctor were in a jungle planet, investigating a distress call of one of the Doctor's old friends. In the background of the message she could hear some scientist crying, ""Why are you calling a doctor? Doctor who?"" 
 ""Um, what are you doing?"" A startled Emily snapped back to reality, looking up to a bemused boy's face,. It would appear while in the depth of her dream, she had started to voice the characters herself, capturing the attention of the boy, Albert. ""Oh! Nothing. Just...making some verbal notes of the class. Yeah!"" she muttered nervously. Albert looked on her paper. Doctor Who doodles covered the edge of the paper. Daleks fighting Cybermen and Ood galore.
*How embarrassing!* she thought. ""Haha, ok, “Albert chuckled. ""You like Doctor Who?"" Emily looked at him. Albert was usually a very quiet and reserved child. He much preferred his drawings and his books than social contact. Why was he talking to her? Did he like Doctor Who too? ""Yes,"" she replied honestly. ""Me too!"" The boy said enthusiastically. And ver since then, they were the best of friends, as thick as theives, watching every new episode together, writing fan-fiction together, drawing pictures of cybermen fighting daleks, arguing who would be a better companion and overall spending time together. Emily hardly thought of her parents when she was with him. Eventually when they were older, they knew they were meant to be together and were at last married. They decided to move far away and change their hair color in order to symbolize their new lease in life, so no one could ever find them in their own little paradise.

true,SCAxman,null,null,"Concealed-carry is a states' rights issue.  There is no federal regulation for the issue of concealed-carry permits, and in many places carrying a gun in public is a federal crime.  And it's more than just felons who are considered [prohibited persons](http://www.atf.gov/firearms/how-to/identify-prohibited-persons.html).  State laws do not replace federal laws they add to them.  

As far as gun crime, part of the way US statistics are tracked regarding ""crime guns"" is to report every single illegally-owned firearm as a criminal act.  The overwhelming majority of US gun crimes are criminals *having* guns, not criminals *using* guns.  If you take the 350-450K annual gun crimes in the US, only 60K are where a firearm was actually employed in the commission of a crime.  (In 2009 in the UK it was 17K I think.)

Guns facilitate roughly 60K crimes in the US but *prevent* 800K-2.5 *million* crimes annually, many of which are undoubtedly violent and highly likely to take lives.  

The US has a small gun problem. I think last year's (2010) statistics track yes, 9K firearm murders, but in light of the fact that private gun ownership literally prevented orders of magnitude more crimes, the US clearly has a large gun solution.  Everyone says that the US has a crippling crime problem but when you get here, it's doesn't seem supportable.

I'm not in a position to predict how gun crime etc. might increase in the UK if we were suddenly allowed weapons similar to the US, but outside specific groups I doubt that too many people would buy them.

The Canadian made the point that there are a ton of rifles/long range weapons in Canada due to their hunting (for sport and food), yet their politicians aren't nearly so protected or sheltered as in the US (I'll admit I haven't checked).

Indeed, Americans killing their Presidents seems almost a national sport.  What have we had, one UK Prime Minister killed in office?  The death and attempted assassination rate of US Presidents is astonishing - it's a dangerous job.

&gt;I'm not in a position to predict how gun crime etc. might increase in the UK if we were suddenly allowed weapons similar to the US, but outside specific groups I doubt that too many people would buy them. But then again there could be an awful lot of people (men) who would get one ""just in case"". Eh, either way - we don't seem to have the mentality bred into us that we have ""certain rights"". That could be because we don't have a specific constitution.

Well, we had fairly loose gun laws up until what was it '86? '87?  Hungerford, without a particularly horrific track record of gun crime.  Part of the problem is definitely the transfer of cultural norms.  Not going to blame TV, but the whole gung-ho wild west, cops and robbers, serial killers, gang violence theme has a certain attraction and can be problematic when people have problems distinguishing fantasy and reality, plus the copycatting on real events, plus the desentisation to violence because the system itself is so violent.

true,geekchic,null,null,"In a society that is happy to pay £2-3 for a coffee, do you really think the price of beer is the reason why pubs are closing?

While undeniably there are commercial issues with tied tenancies etc - I really do think the biggest problem is the pubs own determination to stick to the comparatively recent idea that they are primarily a venue for selling alcohol.

Up to about 100 years ago, the pub was where you ate your meals, or if eating at home, where you took your meal to be heated for you. The pub was the supply of drinkable water (small beer) and warmth at a time when few houses had heating in rooms.

We have had a small period of time when the pub lost the bulk of its ""all night"" family custom and focused on selling beers. And just beers.

Recently, the gastropub has emerged and saved some venues.

Too many are refusing to change though - not necessarily into a gastropub - but what about competing with Starbucks?

Go into a pub and ask for a coffee - if they sell coffee it will be a time consuming hassle for them to provide it. I knew one pub employee where they looked on selling coffee as the most annoying thing they ever had to do.

If pubs started offering ""high street coffee"" to compliment their frankly, rather high street beers, then a lot more customers would use them. They would regain their community atmosphere - which the likes of Starbucks, Neros etc have invested so much effort in cultivating.

Cutting the price of beer by a few pennies is not going to save the pub, only the pub can do that.",0,1332434181,null,0,false,0,c43rnuu,t3_r8h0j,t1_c43rnuu,t3_r8h0j,null,1428573482,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"I think that it's a fact of life that some criminals will have access to guns. That's just the way the world is. So I got unlucky. I ended up being one of the very few people in this country who ends up with a gun against the back of their head and being pretty certain that their life is going to end imminently. As it happens, I am still here and despite it monumentally fucking up my life for a good few years, never have I envisaged a scenario where a gun would have helped me in that situation.

Why? Because it's not like the movies. If you are caught unawares, you are caught unawares and unless that gun happens to be in your hand at exactly the moment when you realise that looking at the potential end of your life, you are going to freeze and do exactly what the person with the gun is telling to you do. Ok, so lets say I had fair warning (which wouldn't have happened as they kicked down my front door) and I did have time to go for a weapon, suddenly we are into a different and far more lethal dynamic: One of us is going to have to pull the trigger. Now, I don't know about you but I'm happier knowing that despite several years of PTSD symptoms and some stolen goods, I don't have to live with the guilt of having shot someone, even if it was them who was in the wrong.

In a nutshell, I see it like this: I got unlucky. Those crime stats you see in the papers? They are made of people and I was one of those people (and not for the first time). That's life. It sucks, but stuff like this happens and you either deal with it and move on or you don't. What I don't see however is how the situation would improve by increasing the availability of weapons... All that does is make situations like the one I was in more likely and the outcome of them more deadly.

Also, the fact that the blue has been darkened to almost black is throwing me off. Somebody made me smile by saying it's the best Estonian kit they've ever seen. It's hard to argue with people saying the colours simply don't represent what we tradtionally are used to.

More importantly in the ""where's the red?"" debate - none of the old kits changed the colour of the flag. I think that's the problem people have, rather than there not being enough red in general.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't think all our buys are shit.

Downing I still see potential (remember the first few games when he went the down the left, he was fucking lightning) He seems to have lost his confidence but I don't think he should play left wing. He should play RIGHT wing, notice the past two games when he dribbles inside how much more effective he is. The cold hard truth is he can't cross, but the good news is he can do nice short passes, can dribble well, and is fast. Consistently playing him on the right and working his way in solves the bad crossing.

Henderson will develop into a solid midfielder, probably not Stevie G status but definitely a good player. I feel bad playing him on the wing a lot because you can tell it's just not his spot. But in time he'll be fine. Was he expensive? Sure, but he can very well justify his price tag in time.

Carroll I think is garbage. Even though he is still very young I don't ever see him become a good player, his ball control won't get much better, and he seems to have a real shitty attitude on the field (notice 80% of the time he is yelling at someone about something). Sure he has played a little better recently but he'll never justify the price tag he was bought for (not his fault for that). Liverpool should cut their losses on this one.

Adam is not good either. In a perfect world (in a 4-4-2) he is a backup for a healthy Stevie and a healthy Lucas, but I don't even see him as a good backup honestly. He just seems lazy, sluggish, and a dirty tackler. I'm not a fan.

And obviously Suarez and Enrique are awesome and I would give them handjobs given the opportunity. 

So what does Pool need? First and foremost a damn good finisher. Think Darren Bent (though I don't want him he is a good example) not much flash but WILL put the ball in the net. Someone like that, that can connect well with Suarez and Stevie and finish like nobody's business. 

Next? A good winger, someone with speed and good ball control. Crossing isn't a necessity because I don't think that is the Reds game. Working the ball on the ground seems to be when we play our best.

Last a midfielder. Now here things get tricky, do we need another holding midfielder or another attacking. On one hand Spearing is a great backup for Lucas, the guy has played great lately. On the other (saying we sell Adam) we need a good backup for Gerrard, Henderson could be that guy, we'll see. I don't know exactly what to do here.

Defenders! This position I think we'll be okay assuming we keep Coates. While Carragher's leadership is always welcomed I think for the most part he's useless on the field and Coates should be the backup (after a little more experience) for Skrtel and Agger. And for fullbacks I think we are good too with Enrique, Johnson, Kelly, and Flanagan.

So this summer is obviously CRUCIAL for Liverpool, hopefully it goes well.

TL;DR Some players suck, some will be good, we need a great striker and winger and possibly another midfielder. 

Edit: one more thing, the players we buy SHOULD be foreign. Cheaper buys, and a much bigger talent pool to chose from. I really don't want to see another overpriced player from the UK.",0,1332437421,null,0,true,0,c43sci4,t3_r8bx3,t1_c43sci4,t1_c43s1fe,null,1428573805,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

NOTE - All this is for a UK based company, compaines dialling from abroad are NOT bound by these regs. (and are where most of the problems come from)

Depending on what they are doing they could be in breach of the OFCOM Regulations.  There are rules around times to call, amounts of calls etc, not causing 'harrasment'.  However how many calls etc constitutes harrasment is not defined...

First of all as people have already advised, register all number you have with the TPS, after 30days they will be breaking regs calling any more (unless its a company you have dealings with, i.e mobile company phoning you about your bills).

Also legitimate companies following the rules should always leave a valid CLI (Caller line indenty) number, which you can use to ring them back to request they no longer contact you.

If these do not work due to an offshore company you may have more luck tricking the systems.

There are some tricks to confuse diallers, they depend on the settings the company has setup, and may not work, but either when you answer the phone be silent for several seconds (this will either get your call disconnected or passed to the robo msg/agents depending on how setup) if this doesn't work try making constant noise for the first 5 sec of the call or so, this may make it think you are an aswering machine.

TL;DR - If UK based, check OFCOM rules &amp; TPS, if calls from international numbers you are screwed...

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"No, I'm more than happy to answer as it happened a long time ago. It was 2001 and I was living in Rusholme in Manchester, about 3 days away from doing my finals. I was in the bath when I heard a knock at the door and my housemate went to get it. There was suddenly a massive bang as the door was forced open and a multitude of voices shouting ""GET ON THE FLOOR! GET ON THE FUCKING FLOOR!"". I initially thought it was armed police and that there must be some sort of mix up so I quickly got out of the bath and wrapped a towel around my waist. I opened the bathroom door and at the bottom of the stairs were three men, hooded and masked, one of which was pointing a semi-auto pistol at me. At this point you stop being in control of your actions and some sort of autopilot kicks in. I stumbled down the stairs (the towel was really long and kept getting caught under my feet) and they shoved us both into the living room and pushed us face down on the floor. One of the guys sat on my back and kept the gun pressed to my head while the others went around looking for valuables. The towel kept falling so I kept squirming, each of which would be replied with jabs in the ribs from the man on my back. I remember me and housemate just looking at each other as our faces were inches apart. He looked terrified and I guess I looked the same. Once the other two guys had scoured the house they came back to the living room and one of them asked us where our cashcards were. We told him and he then explained what would happen next:

""Two of us are going to the cash point while he stays here. Give us your PIN numbers. If we find that they are wrong we will phone him and he will shoot you.""

Naturally, we gave them our PIN numbers (at the time mine was '6969' They thought I was taking the piss and punched me a couple of times. That seemed to confirm that I was telling the truth). At this point one of them tore the phone socket out of the wall and then shouted at us not to fucking move for an hour. They then left. Me and my housemate continued to look at each other in complete terror for what seemed like eternity. In reality it was probably 20 seconds or so. We then ran next door and called the police.

Was it targeted? Probably not. Manchester was fucking dangerous at that time. A year earlier I was beaten so hard in an unprovoked attack that I lost the use of one eye for several months and only narrowly escaped serious brain damage. Other friends had been through similar aggrevated burglaries, one of which involved being held naked at knife point in a garden for over an hour. The MO was well known and they'd just hit houses they thought would contain students.

The weirdest thing though? When it's actually happening, when it's all kicking off I was actually cool as a cucumber. There was just a voice in my head saying over and over ""Do what they tell you and it will be ok"". No fear, no panic, just ""Do what they fucking say"".

I don't even know who in the history of sports we could compare him to as a result of what he did as a player and a manager for this club on such a global scale.  Look at the wikipedia entry for [player/manager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player-coach#Player-manager), even. The first person mentioned as a player/manager in football is Dalglish! Unless Dalglish decides to retire and hand the reigns to Rafa himself, this proposition could never happen.

And rightly so.

I've said it before and I'll say it again: There is no better caretaker in a position to manage the club through this period of time than Dalglish and FSG are smart enough to know that. Imagine the uproar in the entire footballing world if the swashbuckling American capitalists came in and cut off the head of, arguably, the most powerful man in Liverpool's history, at the very least, the most iconic figure in the squad's history that is still alive today. That would be a marketing/branding/merchandising disaster, especially at a point in time where everyone outside of the club is already calling Liverpool a club on the decline. If it wasn't before, it would be if they sacked Kenny.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"&gt;I've only worked in the NHS, not private sector, and even then only for 6 months, so cannot compare efficiencies (and even then not as medical staff but in the NCRS).

Getting NCRS right will be a big help. Expensive hospital appointments are regularly wasted because notes are lost. 

&gt;I also feel that the NHS needs to be kept public, but I think it is daft for people to react to competition and aspects of privatisation as some kind of boogie man, when some of the most positive steps under New Labour were the result of bringing in competition, as it keeps management on its toes. 

I'm not convinced competition and privatisation has helped. There's at best conflicting evidence for this. 

We need to be careful about counter-intuitive outcomes. There's been a lot of research into the way extrinsic rewards (e.g. pay) damages intrinsic motivation. Moving to a pay-by-results model can actually reduce performance even if people end up getting paid more. Research suggests that health professionals are particularly susceptible to this effect.

&gt;I also think, and maybe you'd agree, that if this bill is smashed, or continues to be badly administered, that positive aspects, such as the decentralisation and devolution of decision making closer to the patient level may be politically put back years until it is much harder or even too late. 

The opposition agreed to support GP commissioning if the other aspects of the bill were dropped. Obviously there was a fair amount of political calculation in this offer, but it's clear that there would be some support for decentralisation and GP commissioning as long as the service remains public. Critics will talk about a postcode lottery though. 

The bill has passed now. It looks like we're stuck with it unless the doctors who have pledged to contest the next election get some support.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; Not strictly true - the immediate (or lack of) response by the MPS is broadly considered to have been a result of the ongoing discussions around the immediate and dramatic cuts to budget. To ignore this is to not take the gamut of issues into account that resulted in the riots.

It was a very small factor, the main issue was as I said, decades of socio-economic issues which had been allowed to fester. For a start, the welfare system which was flawed in the manner it made people reliant on it in the long term. If your reliant on the state your perpetually at the mercy of the state.

&gt; I'm not 'just' blaming the evil tories, you are putting word into my mouth. If I could refer you back to my comment - society will be significantly poorer by the end of this governments term in office simply because of the impact of the self enforced austerity and other idealistic changes that are being made. 

It's more of a general statement than specifically directed towards you. As for society being poorer at the end of this administration, it would have been poorer no matter who was in charge. Why? Because the reasons for it being poorer are deep rooted in the framework of our society, and in the actions of the previous administrations going back to the end of WW2. Austerity is something we do actually need right now, and has resulted in some of the cheapest borrowing in history. Which is a good thing because even with austerity we are still borrowing a large amount of money each year, simply to meet operational costs. Had we not engaged in an austerity program the cost of borrowing would most likely be far higher, which given the global economic issues (especially in the Euro-zone, which contains 7 of our top 10 trading partners) would have eventually lead to the need for a far more drastic austerity program.

&gt; Couldn't agree more, however the point I am making is the current government is not changing things to your betterment.

And the point I am making is that none of the current viable options include ""better"", all we have to deal with is varying amounts and types of ""shit"".",0,1332447255,null,0,false,0,c43ugl5,t3_r8bw0,t1_c43ugl5,t1_c43u9eu,null,1428574808,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"&gt;I'm not sure about the LCD aspect though as I think the lottery would result in the fairest system over all. 

Let's say that a school can function as long as the proportion of kids with uninterested parents is less than 20%. But there are 30% of kids like that in our town. (I've no idea what the real numbers are. And it's obviously going to be more nuanced than 20% OK, 21% school fails. Up to a point that doesn't matter because we're talking broad brush policy here.)

If we have five schools and a lottery system, we have five schools which reflect the demographic makeup, They each have 30% of kids with uninterested parents. All the schools fail.

Now allow them to select. We'll probably end up with one failing school filled with kids with uninterested parents, and four successful schools. 

For me there are two ways of reacting to this. 

a. With selection we at least have some successful schools, and the kids with uninterested parents probably weren't going to do all that well anyway. We should try to address this, but as it's a product of deep seated social failure, it's going to take a lot of time and effort. Meanwhile at least the kids with interested parents aren't being held back.

b. With selection the interested parents have got what they want. They won't be motivated to get things changed. And the uninterested parents don't care. A lottery system will make change happen quicker.

It depends on whether much can be done with kids who have been careless enough to choose  uninterested parents.",0,1332447295,null,0,false,0,c43ugwj,t3_r4xt1,t1_c43ugwj,t1_c43ials,null,1428574815,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I very strongly disagree. It is my personal opinion that steps were not taken early in the furore that very easily could have. These steps would have prevented the escalation, not the initial activity that led to the escalation. 
 
&gt;Austerity is something we do actually need right now

So you say. I don't believe any of it. It is my personal opinion that the general public are not getting anything resembling honest and genuine accounts. Its more the convenience of the austerity path for the tory ideology, and how its being repeated/replicated all over the world (I live in a country with a national government - equiv to the tories, and wouldn't you just know that the public sector / services are going through EXACTLY what the UK went through just before I moved over here. It smacks of convenience not necessity. And I don't doubt that you could point me towards pages of sources that demonstrate the need for austerity, I simply don't trust any of them. Perhaps fortunately for the UK fiscal policy, I don't have any say in what we do, and so my opinion does not matter, and until such times that it did (i.e. never) I am unlikely to change my view in the slightest.  

&gt;And the point I am making is that none of the current viable options include ""better""

true,ragewind,uk,,"Guns, the issue the British oppose but don't understand.

our laws are very new in historic terms they started in the 1920 and then mainly came in after the tragedy's.

historically we had no gun control if you had the money you could buy them and ownership was quite high and without any drastic effect.

the USA's 2nd amendment in their constitution was actually modeled on our own Bill of Rights which gave back the right of arms to the Protestants which had been striped from them by king James II the state of the day.

we also don't understand them in general, we see American news and everyone thinks an AK is an evil terrorist, full auto weapon that should be banned. if they see a hunter with a rifle then that seems fine to people, in reality they are both just semi-automatic firearms that have a different skin to them.

i see guns as a viable right that we should have and here is why.

* sport, IT IS a safe sport that teaches discipline and respect and its also very enjoyable.
* hunting, as long as the kill is not endangered and the animal is eaten and not wasted then hunting is fine with me. a free range deer has a better like than any cow, is healthier, is killed more humanly and is much taster. we eat animals so we should not be picky about the murder method as long as its humane
* personal defense, the one we get the most jumpy about. its simple if i'm lawfully going about my business i want the ability to protect my self. the police are good but they are nearly always on the scene after the incident they CAN NOT protect you. so its up to you or the attacker how things play out, you CANT trust a criminal.... its in the name they are a criminal. that leaves you with the option of defending yourself and either your can over power the attacker or you cant. in most cases and likely mine i cant i'm not fit enough nor trained in physical combat, which is about the only thing you can do in the UK to protect yourself out side of your home. physical hand to hand fighting is not an option for such a large % of our population, the old, disabled and ill just cant fight someone off but they do have the right to defend themselves. yes killing someone would really fuck you head up but id much, much rather they be dead then me be disabled, crippled or dead because they didn't give a fuck any way.
* liberty, the one thing a gun can enable that we all ignore. we are far from needing a revolution in our current state, but we do need some changes. the government already ignores the opinion of its people on some issues, they don't have any massively damaging effect yet but no one has a time machine. if we don't protect the rights now our children or grand children could end up in a very screwed world. we all sit there condemning North Korea and Syria for killing, maiming and enslaving its populations and then we are happy that Tunisia, Egypt, Libya have taken their freedom in the Arab spring. The Egyptian revolution was peaceful by most standards but only because the army didn't follow orders to deal with the protesters, the Tunisian and Libyan revolutions and potentially the Syrian one are a different story without the arms you would have lots of corpse's and some harsh words from the UN. simply put governments work for its people so they should fear its people, when governments fear nothing they consider nothing but their own personal interests!

Whilst this is perfectly understandable on an individual basis, everyone seems to feel entitled to fast broadband, the ""egalitarian"" push to provide fast service to villages and remote rural areas - well, that's just the least efficient area to focus on and it seems like a disproportionately expensive way to give the nation faster broadband.

I have no love of BT *at all*, but it seems like the government who is making rural areas a big target for fast broadband. And I'd guess that the people in such rural areas are disproportionately home-owners and middle-class - Tory-inclined voters. 

If the same money is spent in towns and cities it can get faster broadband to more people. I believe that in Sweden's rural areas the home owner is (and long has been) responsible for paying a connection fee for fibre, one that comes in at c £800 per house. 

I can find figures for New Zealand [indicating cost of fibre installation at £750 - £1500 per house](http://www.nbr.co.nz/fibre) - that's for homes within 30m of the kerb - and that's quite a lot of money to recoup. If the service provider sets aside £10 of your monthly fees to cover this then it'll take them 7 - 13 years to amortise the installation.

Theo took learnt about the clothing retail industry and took advantage of outsourcing to the far east at the very start when sweatshops first started importing to the U.K
Peter Jones got into mobile technology about a year before the first phones emerged on the market and took full advantage.

Alan Sugar capitalised on the personal tech boom (record players, then cheap computers) by being one of the first people to outsource to Japan.

Kenny was in no way reluctant to come back - he jumped at the opportunity. Any reluctance would have been over being given the role on a caretaker basis rather than full-time. Besides, with the type of signings he's made - Henderson, Carroll, Coates are all young and improving, and Enrique, Adam and Suarez aren't much older either - he's definitely trying to build a team over more than a single season. He's not going to tell FSG he wants to be done.

Rafa looks fantastic now that he's not around, eh? The same might just happen with Kenny. If Rafa's world class, Kenny isn't far behind - in his first spell as manager, he created a team whose fluid attacking football was thought to be ***better than Brazil's***. We saw glimpses of that towards the end of last season, but that was a team with nothing to play for but pride, and riding the 'new manager' wave that we see at Sunderland. This time, he's starting from a much weaker starting point, both in terms of quality and belief. It will take time, and time is what he'll be given.

true,Teh_Warlus,null,null,"It's a lot different - he focuses on the fantasy plot storytelling side of things, as opposed to RTD who was more into character driven sci-fi. It's also a difference of direction: Moffat loves visual storytelling, Davies tends to be more traditional in his approach. RTD had some moments of sheer brilliance and some disasters, while Moffat in average fares better. It's also somewhat of an uneven comparison, as Moffat was at the helm with a far higher budget and has the advantage of gorgeous HD cinematography, while he has had less time to get into the groove of things.

Beyond that, RTD worked with two Doctors and three companions, so we can better judge his handling of the cast. I say overall, Moffat seems to be overdoing the Doctor's quirkiness in the dialogue (catchphrases are cool), and goes over the top a bit more often. I think Moffat paradoxically is aiming at a younger audience despite the darker tone of the series under his helm... which is the main reason that Smith hasn't had a moment when he feels as dark as Eccleston in Dalek or Tennant in The Waters of Mars.

Overall, I'd rate them rather evenly, all things considered. But I feel Moffat has the potential for being better - RTD hit his stride in mid series 3, Moffat didn't have that time at the helm yet. It may be because I am a bit biased because Matt Smith is doing a balancing act between childish and alien, and while the latter is awesome, the former just gets old so fast (IMO, Moffat's Christmas specials are near-unwatchable for this reason).

tl;dr: You can't really compare the two, but given a choice, I'd rather have Moffat at the helm for his potential to take the series to new places.",0,1332460774,null,0,false,0,c43x4p4,t3_r8zer,t1_c43x4p4,t3_r8zer,null,1428576054,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; I very strongly disagree. It is my personal opinion that steps were not taken early in the furore that very easily could have. These steps would have prevented the escalation, not the initial activity that led to the escalation. 

What steps would they have been? Other than what did actually seem to work which was pouring 16000 amped up riot police into London and making damn sure everyone about it?

&gt; So you say. I don't believe any of it. It is my personal opinion that the general public are not getting anything resembling honest and genuine accounts. Its more the convenience of the austerity path for the tory ideology, and how its being repeated/replicated all over the world (I live in a country with a national government - equiv to the tories, and wouldn't you just know that the public sector / services are going through EXACTLY what the UK went through just before I moved over here. It smacks of convenience not necessity. 

That's because the UK is not facing a unique problem. Huge amounts of the developed world thought they had found a magic solution to the problem of people wanting lots of things they couldn't afford. So personal loans and credit were pushed on the people, finance regulations were relaxed and nations borrowed money with gay abandon while claiming it would last forever. 

Then the entire thing fell off a cliff.

Now many nations are facing huge deficits and all those problems they thought they had fixed have come back to haunt them. Mainly how to fund all the 1st world benefits people loved having in an era where people don't have a huge amount of money and don't want to pay the taxes required to fund them. And the people are pissed, because the world they rather enjoyed living in turned out to be a lie. 

There are many solutions, which all have their own pitfalls and dangers, not one of which is actually guaranteed to work. We could try and borrow our way out of this, but the risk there is that we'll have to keep doing this for a long period of time and even then it simply won't work that well. We could end up with a lowered credit rating which will make it far more expensive to borrow, which we need to do just to fund operational costs let alone any stimulus investments. And then there is the problem of mounting debt, which will mean spending more on debt interest than we're spending on education or healthcare if not managed. It's essentially making it our kids problem, as they will be left with the debt long after the people who racked it up have all died.

And then there is the idea of cutting expenditure to reduce the deficit (or at least stop it growing). It has the risk of killing growth, but the EU crisis is probably largely responsible for that. And because of what I consider to be mistakes made by the previous administration, it will also hurt the poor. Why? Because they are the people who are reliant on the state. The wealthy don't need money from the state because they have their own, where as poor people don't. So you need to reform the welfare system and tax code to make working a better proposition than it is now. Which if you look at changes like Universal Credit replacing a multitude of benefits, along with a more flexible approach to handling welfare payments to those entering the workforce and a higher personal allowance, it's what the coalition is trying to do. Peope will say ""but where are the jobs?"", and the answer is that it's not an instant fix. There will be a recovery at some point, and with it more jobs, and when that does happen the new welfare system and higher personal allowance will actually help more people back into work than the welfare system would have at the end of the previous administration.

So yes. This does come down to ideology. The Tory part is fiscally conservative by nature, which essentially comes down to the idea of not spending money you don't have, saving and working for the money you do have. This is tempered by the Orange Book ideology which tends towards sensible things like not taxing poor people in order to fund a system to give them welfare payments required because their after tax income is to small to live on, and other bizarre liberal ideas. I would talk about Labours ideology, but frankly I don't think the party has one beyond ""what does the Guardian say today?"", I'd quite like them to fix this sooner rather than later then.

&gt; And I don't doubt that you could point me towards pages of sources that demonstrate the need for austerity, I simply don't trust any of them. Perhaps fortunately for the UK fiscal policy, I don't have any say in what we do, and so my opinion does not matter, and until such times that it did (i.e. never) I am unlikely to change my view in the slightest. 

It's a shame. There is nothing to fear in changing ones opinion. After all, the more information you have the more accurate your views can be.

&gt; Sure, and the point I am making is the current option are all very busy feathering their own nests at your and society in generals cost. As is the Tory ideology. 

It's not Tory ideology, it's people. You take any group of people, say a group of academics you view as being intellectual gods of liberal progressivism. Then give them an economy to run that is full of holes, several wars, a police force that makes corrupt look like an improvement and a population that thinks X-Factor is actually important.

&gt;What steps would they have been?

Addressing the public disturbance at the first location (where Mr Duggan was shot). They didn't engage fully at that time, I believe, to make a specific point about the funding cuts that where coming up. The funding crisis was probably 2 years in (we had all had our various budgets in the MPS hit by that point, we had lost significant numbers of contractor staff in the 12 month prior, most depts had to find around 22% (operational and non operational), this was supposed to be staged over 4 years, but there was repeated talk of -40% planning for 'worst case' eventualities. I left not long after the general election, but at the time I left, the atmosphere was terrible. There was much dark mutterings about capability, coming from senior officers that really hasn't come out in the wash. Not about the riots specifically, but about the ability of the MPS to perform the job its was detailed to do - look after the safety of London. This is all my personal opinion based on nothing more than the snippets I heard and saw before and after I left the MPS. 

&gt;There is nothing to fear in changing ones opinion.

I have no problem with being wrong, or changing my opinion, but on this topic I have never once been convinced by the arguments being offered. Without commenting on any one religion specifically, it 'feels' we are being evangelised into believing the facts that are offered. Its simply all to convenient for me to not regard the whole exercise with absolute suspicion. The similarity between the funding (or cutting should I say) activities and subsistent regression of workers rights as we entered  austerity, and some arcane representation of the robber barons, landed gentry or any period of history where the monied immorally squeezed every drop of value from the worker. 

&gt;It's not Tory ideology

And again, this is the point I am making... the tories are making idealogical changes to the fabric of society consistent with the parties long held views. Of course there is some interpretation in the various historical expressions of interest (or otherwise) in specific parts e.g. the NHS, but I think I am correct in asserting that the Conservative Party has wanted to dismantle the NHS for a long time, which is exactly what I would posit is slowing happening. 

I take your point about the necessity of change on any governing body, however the trends are clear, 'nu labour' was not a left, or even centre political force, it was when it was first elected and slowly wandered into the fiscally right territory. The wars where significantly democratically opposed, yet we still ended up in them, Police corruption? Money. Money money money. Money and a largely right leaning overly influential press (allowed to be so because of a well oiled political machine that craved/craves them), and the creeping politicising of the governance layer of Policing, via who? Oh. Boris. For me, the devil is in the interpretation of detail, and that interpretation really does depend on what part of the story you can see, and how you got there.

Rose didn't develop as a character, but my feelings about her did.  I went from not caring about her at all to thinking she eventually showed some emotion and when she was sealed in the alternate dimension I felt for the doctor (and only sort of for her).

Donna always just seemed to be in the doctor's way, would slap him around when she didn't understand what was going on, complained and wanted to go home plenty of times, and was generally annoying to listen to.  I hoped from the episode where she was the bride that I'd never see her again :(

I felt that Martha was at least a useful companion, if nothing else.  As a doctor she would put what knowledge she had to use and checked on people who were hurt, etc.  she wasn't exactly the most emotive, but she was still pleasant for the most part.

I link it similarly to the possible paradox in *Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban*. Harry could see himself cast the patronus, and then later actually cast it, because he had already seen himself do it. By not going back in time and saving himself, he would actually create a paradox... 

If it can already be remembered as happening, such as Amy buying herself ice cream at the fair, and Kazran hugging himself. Although, it could be argued, that a clear, conscious memory of the event isn't necessary. With The Three Doctors and The Five Doctors, it was my understanding that they couldn't remember what they had done in the previous regeneration. (I may be very wrong though, as I've only seen bits and pieces of the Classic Who, and most of my information about the earlier series is from only summaries.) 

At the same time, in Time Crash, 10 clearly remembers being 5 and watching himself as 10 figure out how to separate the Tardis from herself.

The most goals are conceded at the end of the first half and right out of the gate in the second half and then at the end of the match.

**0'-30'** - We start really strong.

**31'-60'** - We concede a chunk of goals in this time period.

**61'-75'** - Not a lot of goals. I imagine that after conceding goals at the end of the first half and beginning of the second half, we lock it down again.

**76'-90'** - We - frustratingly - concede a chunk of goals again.




Some things I wonder about, though:

1.
If we argue that it's a lack of focus/motivation in our squad... whose fault is that?

a. Kenny and the coaching staff?

b. Our players?

c. A bit of both? (That's what I think).


2.
I'd like to see a similar chart for City, United, Spurs, Chelsea, Arsenal. Is this a pattern that just happens for a lot of squads?

If so, we're probably being a little too self-critical.

Granted, this gets thrown a bit by the amount we spent on some of the players, but I think these last 2 windows were the exception rather than the norm - FSG wanted to get the fans onside that they were willing to invest in the team. Also, we still don't know how much was recouped in player sales this summer, and how much the wage bill was trimmed. All of this will put transfer prices like Henderson's &amp; Downing's in context.

true,ragewind,uk,,"this is one of the problems with gun debates is that those who dont use or know guns end up using terms that dont make sence in the context of guns to gun users.

&gt;I agree, the only guns which should be legally available are guns which are fully designed for hunting wild animals, nothing more. 

my points were about this type of comment which is very commonly used by anti gun lobbies as if there is some way to separate them.

&gt;Purpose of a handgun or Semi-automatic machine gun is the slaughter of humans, there is no other efficient use besides this.

again this if full of inaccuracy's that id say come from not having experience with firearms.

there are no semi-auto machine guns, semi auto is one bullet per trigger pull, all it does over a bolt action is use recoil to load the next round compared with the shooters hand operating the bolt.

semi autos have a use in sport as there are disciplines for these, they are also used for vermin control.

hand guns are currently only used by criminals so all you see are the killings but they are also a sporting item, to the extent that they are fully established Olympic sports classifications for them. 

this follows on to the other common anti gun point which is linking crime to an item.

&gt;purpose of a handgun or Semi-automatic machine gun is the slaughter of humans

&gt;construction was for utilitarian purposes, not murdering. 

the items don't do ANYTHING period people do and by banning them you remove them from the law abiding and the criminals still get them as they are criminals.

if the army came around and left you a general purpose machine gun and left would YOU sudenly become a murder???

no

would the gun jump up and kill your neighbor???

no

why because you sound like someone that how no intention of ever harming anyone.

as for proper machine guns, its true they don't have a hunting or sporting reason but the entire Arab spring has shown that there can come a time when rights and democracy needs fighting for.

although we don't need it now we cant predict the future, but one thing is sure if we remove our rights now be it for arms, speech or the internet in the aims of saving lives and protecting the ""children"" then the future generations are more likely to be abused and walked on by the state that has more and more power and control.",0,1332502237,null,0,false,0,c442qnq,t3_r8am8,t1_c442qnq,t1_c442lmw,null,1428578774,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,freakzilla149,uk,Dirty Immigrant,"&gt;This isn't the USA and creationism has a negligible amount of traction in the UK, so getting all shouty is daft. Both the CoFE and Catholic churches don't support it.

Of course, their previous position was untenable after a hundred years of the Origin of Species and the supporting evidence that followed from Geology, paleontology, Genetics etc. 

However, evolution is not the only problem, they both have strong opposition to homosexuality and the Catholic church even has its absurd opposition to condoms. Organisations as immoral as these should be allowed anywhere near our Children.

&gt;they run thousands of schools here, and importantly in many areas ones that outperform the state.

In my village, the school, church, pub, shop, are all first language Welsh. It is used in normal conversation both business and private. The children only learn English from the age of 5 or 6 apart from what they pick up from tv. 

The major cause of the decline in Welsh is probably caused by the idea that it is considered rude to speak Welsh when English speakers are present. This discourages learners from learning Welsh. It also encourages the idea that Welsh is just an academic language rather than the working language that it is.

i believe season 4 will be good if they don't just continue to make these single episodes with a single plot each episode which is what is being done. A new power/character is introduced each episode and by the end it is resolved, a power switch here and there but nothing really ongoing (which is what i enjoy about tv most!). 

They need something a bit more ongoing like future simon but those episodes with multiple sub stories that take a few episodes or even a whole season to unravel. Perhaps another (forbidden)love interest like simon and sally and another character who portrays a different personality. Nathan II (rudy) is cool but it'd be better if they brought a new character in who was completely different and they spent more time trying to get him to fit into the group as it really wasn't touched on too much with rudy. he kind of was just put in the 'gang' and because best mates with them instantly.

I have never voted for Labour, and would have described myself as a Lib Dem if pushed before the Coalition. It's got nothing to do with 'tribalism'. 

As for ID cards and CCTV - one of those didn't happen (although they did waste a whole load of money on it), and the second doesn't really have that much to do with national government. Labour weren't great, but they wouldn't have frozen pensioner's personal allowance in order to  give the top 1% a tax cut. They wouldn't have cut tens of billions from the welfare budget and introduced privatisation to the NHS, they wouldn't introduce regional pay to keep low-wage areas that way. Maybe it was an attempt to stay in the pockets of the unions or something, but they didn't come across like they detest the poor quite like this current government (or at least the Tory faction) do. 

No matter how ineffective you think their governance is, there is an ideological difference between the two parties, and I have a deep grievance with the tory party's view of the world.

It will not stop binge drinking by any measure, even if you're a teenager £10 can buy you enough vodka to hospitalise you. The main group likely to be hit most are people with a dependency, the hidden alcoholics that drink at home on a daily basis and it's a larger demographic than you'd expect.
Binge drinkers will remain, people may do it slightly less but will most likely compensate by drinking more when they do get chance.     ",0,1332513552,null,0,false,0,c4444gt,t3_r9os5,t1_c4444gt,t3_r9os5,null,1428579416,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This is just typical. If there's a problem on the roads, stick up some cameras and watch the money roll in. NHS in need of repair? Effectively privatise it. And now there's people getting smashed and violent up and down the country, so they penalise all drinkers. 
Why do all our governments see fines, charges and taxes as the answer to every issue in Britain? Surely they need to tackle the actual anti-social behaviour by fining or ASBOing the louts, or stopping binge promotions and BOGOFS in town centre bars. 

They talk about wanting a mediterranean attitude to drinking over here, when we seem to cultivate the exact opposite. ",0,1332513778,null,0,false,0,c4445tt,t3_r9os5,t1_c4445tt,t3_r9os5,null,1428579438,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2
