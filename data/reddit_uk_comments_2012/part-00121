10: Midnight.

I love the creepy episodes so much, and this one has got to be the creepiest. I love the tension that builds throughout, and there is an excellent conclusion. It was very scary seeing the Doctor get so uncomfortable when he is usually so in control. 

11: The Doctor, The Widow and The Wardrobe

Just one of the most heart-warming episodes of television I've ever seen. I would find it hard to believe if someone did not ""happy cry"" during the resolution.

It's just what I've seen. I've got 2 HP's and a Compaq here waiting for new motherboards after they cooked themselves. I've re-built a few Advents after the casing has fallen apart. Acer are the best of the worst. I see them least of this group but when I do it's usually broken hinges or keyboards that shed keys. They just seem to randomly fall off from use.


Asus, Toshiba, Lenovo and Samsung seem to put an effort into actually building their laptops properly with hinges that don't wear out in a year, coolers that work and casing that isn't paper thin. The only time I've repaired one of these was an Asus with a failed hard drive because it had been dropped down the stairs (screen was fine) and a Toshiba with a broken keyboard after he let his 3 year old daughter use it.

I wouldn't call this frugal advice per-se but rather advice from one student to another.

Malcolm Tucker

The ‚ÄúThe Thick Of It‚Äù character asks who rearranged the deckchairs on this Titanic: G4S?

Ever since the Olympics rolled into town everyone in Britain has had this weird upbeat feeling. Even long-term Leonard Cohen fans have sounded perkier than Andi Peters on Ecstasy. So what does David Cameron do? He decides to pour a giant bucket of steaming piss on our parade. And how does he do that? By having a reshuffle.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, he needed to have a reshuffle ‚Äî everything he‚Äôs done or tried to do since coming to power has been a disaster, from attempting to privatise trees to letting Chloe Smith talk in public. So, yeah, he needed to have a reshuffle all right, but the worst thing he could do was actually have a reshuffle. Because having a reshuffle took everyone out of our Olympic and Paralympic La-La land and reminded us that (a) we have a government; (b) it‚Äôs f***ing terrible, and (c) it‚Äôs just been reshuffled in a way that makes it even more terrible.

So what are the headlines? A woman who doesn‚Äôt like gays as Equalities Minister, a man who is frightened of flying as Transport Secretary and someone who lots of people would like to see dead in charge of Health. Seriously, who was behind this piece of strategy? The Chuckle Brothers? It‚Äôs like a joke reshuffle.

Why not go the whole f***ing hog and put Louis Walsh in charge of Defence and make an angry toddler Minister for Justice? How about Ant and Dec heading up DECC? The writer of Fifty Shades of Grey as Chief Whip? Or what about this ‚Äî the decomposing heads of the Dragons Den bosses strung together to form a Newton‚Äôs Cradle running the Department for Work and Pensions?

But none of that is the Real Problem with the shake up. The Real Problem is that the Chancellor is still there. Cameron should have shuffled George Osborne out of the Exchequer and to the backbenches or, better still, off this f***ing mortal coil.

Why? I‚Äôll tell you why. Because George Osborne is so f***ing unpopular that when he went to hand out medals at the Paralympics even the mascots Wenlock and Mandeville were giving him the finger.

And why is ‚ÄúGorgeous George‚Äù so unpopular? (I use ‚Äúgorgeous‚Äù ironically. And ‚ÄúGeorge‚Äù, for that matter.) Is it because he has the shifty look of a sex pest caught rubbing himself over the buffet at a funeral? Or is it that he‚Äôs a millionaire who is doing to the economy what Russell Brand likes to do to granddaughters? Hard to say. All we know for certain is that since DC introduced his ‚Äúhappiness index‚Äù it has told us that George Osborne is the main thing responsible for our unhappiness. I‚Äôm not a believer in f***ing signs or portents but it can‚Äôt be a coincidence that his initials are GO.

Maybe I‚Äôm being too harsh on Cameron. Maybe I should give him a second chance ‚Äî the way he gave his Head of Communications, Andy Coulson, a second chance before he was arrested and charged with perjury. (You may think as a former government Head of Communications I am gloating. I am not. I only mention it because I am writing this for a Murdoch-owned newspaper and I know how rigorous they like to be with the facts). But I don‚Äôt think I am being too harsh on the Prime Minister ‚Äî I think the pancake-faced, claret-swilling pony-f***er has RUINED EVERYTHING (including my ability to hold down my tea when I see him on the evening news).

Cameron‚Äôs Government is so catastrophically incapable that this reshuffle is less like rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic and more like rearranging Titanics on a f***ing Super Titanic. And while the Titanics on the Super Titanic all head towards each other and the inevitable catastrophic conclusion he is parachuting in a team of expert ship scuttlers to speed things up. Meanwhile, despite the fact that a large amount of money has been spent on deckchairs, G4S have just announced that they will not be able to provide enough people to rearrange them.

The problem for the Conservatives is this: somehow, Christ alone knows how, the acceptable face of the Tory party is Boris Johnson. Yes. You read that right. Boris titting Johnson. A man who looks like he ate a scarecrow and sicked it up on himself. But he is also the only popular Tory. And the one and only Tory they can‚Äôt shuffle into the Cabinet.

So what should Dave do now? Well, the answer‚Äôs obvious. He should stand down and let Nick Clegg take over. I‚Äôm f***ing kidding. Seriously, can you imagine?

No, sadly for Dave, he‚Äôll just have to keep plodding on RUINING EVERYTHING until the electorate won‚Äôt tolerate it any more and all his friends are in jail.

true,Admiral_Bison,,Belfast,"Good question... I would personally hope that we are seeing a definitive move towards the middle. However, having worked very closely with some of these parties,  I can tell you that [Mike Nesbitt will be suffering a very intense backlash](http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/local/emails-lay-bare-maginnis-nesbitt-row-1-4205547) from this stance on homophobia. Lord Maginnis is a representative of an internal 'core' of senior party members that all share his views. This same core selected Tom Elliot as their mouth piece - and he only ran for leadership under the guise that they would be the speakers, and he the megaphone. However, when he took office, the battering that he'd taken thoughout the leadership campaign in relation to Good relations etc had them scatter, leaving him very much alone with no experience nor clue of how to lead. 

This essentially weakened the internal core of these staunch traditionalist - the negative publicity and Tom Elliot's inability to handle the pressure of interviews or party discipline (frequently making mistakes and putting his foot in it). They lost a lot of their clout in the party, and Mike was selected when Tom was to step down due to his support of Tom and his orchestration of his PR behind the scenes during the leadership election had earned their loyalties and trust. So he was the natural choice... especially with his media background, despite his party member 'youth'.

Now he's taken a very 'liberal' stance (in the party's mind) and Lord Maginnis is only of the belief that he is able to throw so much weight around because he has been party of this internal core for so long, and for so long they have been very much pulling the strings. With Mike's popularity to date and his 'modern' views on social issues, he's gaining momentum with the public, but he's alienating a powerful and perhaps dangerous element to his leadership. 

I would say we'll either see a very definitive split in the UUP over the coming few years, or a a lot of leavers and perhaps a strengthening of support for the 'modernised' social views. A lot of the traditionalists still see the DUP as 'traditional' in this respect from my conversations, and hence a huge number of past UUP traditionalist supporters have flocked to the DUP in recent years - so I'd not say we should expect much ['liberalism' in their faction for the next while](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/creationist-bible-group-and-its-web-of-influence-at-stormont-16205034.html)... the Orange Order decision is a positive one, but don't forget, Edwin Poots is still standing over his decision &amp; horrific remarks on the ['Gay Blood Ban'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-18497159) - He was also the highest voted in his constituency by over 1500 votes to the next candidate who was UUP, this equated to about 20% of the constituency. 

So in short, I wouldn't see 'Unionism' shifting - I see it splitting. I don't see the DUP moving any time soon while they're enjoying so many of the old UUP supporters within the public signing up. I think the UUP still has a *lot* of trouble a head, but generally those members who have been enjoying higher profiles in the media over the past few years, are those members who could be described as the more liberal ones. Public opinion is becoming apparent, and that is having a strange result on the party itself. 

So I think we'll be seeing either a spectacular demise as liberals get increasingly frustrated with the slow changes and infrequent wins and jump ship to the Alliance such as Paula Bradshaw and Harry Hamilton, or an unexpected strengthening and upheaval - which I doubt considering Mike Nesbitt's own traditionalism... I'm not sure just how far he can stretch. In the same vein, if Mike keeps playing it safe either way, he'll cause these problems anyways - so he needs to pick a stance. Either get more liberal without being too much like the Alliance, or get more staunch and attract back the ugly traditional underbelly who have already proven to been too powerful and yet too uncoordinated in the past.",0,1347111057,null,0,false,0,c658ssz,t3_zjxti,t1_c658ssz,t3_zjxti,null,1429848232,6,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,6
true,julieb123,null,null,"Food

* Find your local Aldi and local market (like, the stalls with the fruits and veggies and the cheese stall, etc). They will save you so much more than Asda/Tesco/Sainsbury/big chains. Home Bargains and B&amp;M are your best friends when it comes to name brand snacks/sodas/candy that you can't find at Aldi. My town is a student town that has all of the above plus a bulky food store and health food stores that sell spices in bulk. BEST THING EVER. Oh, and [get one of these](http://www.comparestoreprices.co.uk/images/ma/marketeer-stair-climber-shopping-trolley.jpg) if you're going to be walking all about town with all that heavy stuff (sweet jesus do they save your back). If you're willing to shell out a bit more for the organic stuff, [Abel and Cole](http://www.abelandcole.com) is pretty great, delivered weekly. 


Travel

* Parking will be a nightmare in a big city, so it's probably better to leave the car at home. Find out about your new town's bus fares. Not sure how close to campus you are, but if you need a bus, it's going to be substantially cheaper to buy a weekly/monthly pass than single or daily fares. If you end up buying a day ticket and then realize you'd rahter have a pass, go to the bus station's info booth - they'll often let you use that daily pass as credit towards your weekly/monthly pass 


Furniture

* Bigger charity shops are a great place for furniture. My husband and I got both of our huge desks at one (for a total of ¬£80).  Look for going-out-of-business sales at shops with a homewares section. We got a decent 12 pc set (4x large plates, small plates, bowls) for **¬£6**. 


Kitties

* If you get a cat, a SUPER highly recommend [Oko Cat litter](http://www.petsathome.com/shop/clumping-oko-plus-cat-litter-10ltr-by-cat-s-best-15263). Clumping, flushable, lightweight, and safe for your kitties (they eat whatever is in their toes, after all, and eating clay and perfume isn't exactly healthy). I have 2 cats, and that one bag lasts over a month. [Purely dry cat food](http://www.petsathome.com/shop/cat/cat-food-treats/all-dry-cat-food/?ref1=1|Brand-|Purely&amp;rpp=260) is also a great value. It's cheap but still made without byproducts, and my cats seem to love the chicken flavor and salmon flavor. It's half the price of the Pet's At Home's Advanced Nutrition, too! Oh and if you're rescuing a cat that isn't from a shelter, rescue shelters typically offer discounted services like spay/neuter, vaccinations, and microchipping. IMPORTANT.


Misc

* Stock up on frozen pizza/chips/etc for when you want a takeaway to stop yourself from shelling out too much on trashy food. I mean, if you're gonna get the trashy stuff (as well all crave sometimes), might as well not spend 5x the price on it.

* Don't overfill your kettle. Ours is 3Kw. If it's super full and someone is making ONE cup, fucking hell, all that wasted/costly energy and water!!

* Instead of paying that TV licensing fee if you're not gonna watch a lot of TV, sign up for Amazon Prime. Not only do you have the largest possible selection of every streaming movie/TV show available to you, but you also get free one-day shipping, and it's just ¬£80/year!",0,1347111058,null,0,false,0,c658st4,t3_zj5v4,t1_c658st4,t3_zj5v4,null,1429848232,2,false,UKFrugal,t5_2u4mi,2

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"As I hinted in my other comment, I've found I have to be confrontational to get them to stop hassling me. If you're too passive, they seem to assume you'll eventually give in. I imagine their pretty good at bullying the elderly and other vulnerable people into paying for something they don't need. It's possible they've found out I've got Aspergers, and that's why they assume a bit more harassment may be profitable.

That said, I've never had a visit. That's part of the confrontation bit - stating that if they really believed I'd be breaking the law they'd have tried one of their inspections. Though next time around, I've promised myself that I'll put in (reasonable) prices for entry - compensation for my time and loss of privacy, basically. You know, just in case. If I'm too insistent that they can't come in, I figure at some point they'll do the ""you must have something to hide"" thing, especially as although I don't remember my wording I'm pretty sure I demanded they do one or stop harassing me. But if they compensate me for wasting my time doing their pointless inspections, that's fair enough. Then it's down to license payers to demand why their license fee is being wasted on pointless witch-hunts.

Anyway, one thing bullies love is when the people start blaming their victims, making up moralising excuses for why it must be the victims fault. The only power the TV Licensing people have to do their job is basically bullying, and that isn't really legal either - which is why they've been taken to court quite a few times and lost. I wouldn't be surprised if they're simply devious enough bullies to know that if people can point to some license payers and say ""well they're not being harrassed"", that plenty of people will assume it must somehow be the victims fault. There's enough of a tendency this way anyway that it's described in social psychology textbooks, so you don't need to do much to encourage it.

Even more likely, though - demographics. Some people are probably considered more likely to be criminals because of the area they live in, the job they do etc. Whereas others are probably considered more likely to be able to employ lawyers - as I said, the TV Licensing Authority has been taken to court and lost before so it has to manage that risk.

There was a time when watching a video or playing a video game needed a TV license, but that isn't the case now. You only need a TV license to watch TV as it's broadcast. If you watch a TV show in real time as it's broadcast, the means don't matter - even if you're watching it streamed over the internet from a foreign relay (I imagine some such service exists), you need a license. Also recording a live TV show, even if you don't watch it until later.

But if you don't watch TV as it's broadcast, you're fine to own a TV. Best to keep it no-where need an aerial cable - saves confusion if you ever do have an inspection - but other than credibility issues, even if that cable was plugged in, that's perfectly legal until you use the TV to watch a show as its broadcast.

There are plenty of ways to support the BBC without having a TV licence [I do agree, btw, that if you're watching live, you should get a licence.]

Perfect example: This evenings Doctor Who. Having not had a TV Licence for a little over three years, I won't be watching live. I usually go to a friends house, however she's off out this evening, so no watching it there either. I'll watch it tomorrow morning.

Whilst I therefore won't be counted in the live viewing figures, my streaming tomorrow morning will be included in the final revised [all platforms] figures.

Then there's the fact I'll be buying the series on blu-ray once it's availible. I own every series of NuWho on either DVD [Mostly Eccleston to early Tennant] or Blu-Ray [Latter Tennant, all Smith.]

So they're still getting money, just not in the form of the licence fee settlement.

[Spoilers abound. I'm new to reddit and don't know how to tag them. Be warned]

In the very first scene of *Asylum* it was apparent that the converted human still thought and emoted and remembered like a human.

This is important, because it shows that the converted Daleks are capable of carrying a human consciousness in their memories:

&gt;Doctor: Do you remember who you were, before they hollowed you and and made you their puppet?

&gt;Convert: My memories are only reactivated if they are required ...

Also, earlier:

&gt;Doctor: It's a trap

&gt;Convert: What is?

&gt;Doctor: You are, and *you don't even know it*.

This suggests that not only are the Dalek converts capable of holding human intelligence, but they also have some of the qualities of computers: it is possible to control the flow of information on them, reactivate information and needed *presumably possible to transfer and store information on them*

&gt;Oswin: I am Oswin Oswald. I fought the Daleks and I am human. **Remember me.**

The ""remember me"" bit now seems to have a slightly different meaning.

Oswin has the means (pathnet) to transfer information, she can over-ride the Daleks that are on the pathnet, she can certainly delete memories, she can presumably transfer information (and it is certainly possible in the *Who* universe for consciousness to be uploaded and transferred, see: River Song in the library), and there are two Dalek/human converts outside of the asylum on the Dalek ship (which is certainly within the range and scope of her overwrite powers, given how she can alter the memories of all of the Daleks to forget the Doctor).

So, theory goes that Oswin simply transferred herself out of there, ended up on the over-written memory of one of the Dalek/humans (this way she didn't need to scheme to bring the doctor in, didn't need the sonic, and genuinely thought she was human until the doctor broke the news to her), and if she is going to be the next companion, the Doctor is going to have to get over his Dalek-phobia


Loose ends to this theory:


-The problem of differing appearances: Neither of the Dalek converts that she could have transferred her consciousness to are played by Jenna Louise Coleman, and we know (unless Moffat is playing a trick on us) that Louise Coleman is going to be playing the next companion.

Solution: Maybe the Dalek/human converts are mainly machine, and like the teselecta have manipulable appearances


-The problem of differing names (Clara =/= Oswin)

But I agree with the Christmas Specials. Christmas Invasion is maybe not that good because it has a lot of story in it because of the regeneration but A Chrsitmas Carol or Voyage of the Damned can be great.
In fact, I would start with Rose or The Eleventh Hour. Start at a point where you can go on watching a season and let them see the development of the stories on their own!

Some, sure. Not all. There are plenty of university and college courses which are less than full time and full cost. Illegal immmigrants don't come to the UK to get educational visa so they can earn 6k a year and pay 15k in tuition fees, they go for the courses that are 200-500 a semester (I should think that would be somewhat obvious).

You (and lots of people in this thread) really don't appear to understand that this is not about regular real students doing three or four years of uni and getting a degree, this is about visa mills who get very poor people (mostly from India and China) a visa with which they live in sheds with beds, and earn below minimum wage working for exploitative bosses in the hope that they can get a better live which they never will because they're illegals.

The guy talks about the great discussion and debates he had about things like Bad Wolf, but in the end they were all bollocks because none of the writing actually lead up to what Bad Wolf was, same with Vote Saxon. If anyone ever said they saw either of those things coming, I'd say they were full of shit. I even remember an interview in which RTD said the whole Bad Wolf thing was originally just supposed to be graffiti that didn't mean anything, but later put it in as part of the plot since so many fans thought it meant something. 

Seriously, I'm up for discussion, but 'How come Amy was left handed as a child, but now she likes peanut butter?' is not a plot hole, and if the overall plot doesn't make sense, or you think there is no character development, you're just not paying attention or trolling.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"These are people who have no means to do their job properly. People who justify bullying with statements such as ""how else can we catch license evaders"". And sure enough, there is no reasonable way they can.

But put it this way - imagine you suspect that someone down the road from you may have done something wrong. You have no evidence and no particular reason to suspect them, but you suspect. The best you can do is ""I have no proof that they *haven't* broken the law"". Does that justify you repeatedly accusing and threatening them?

The fact is that it's virtually impossible for the TV licensing people to get objective evidence. That's only really possible by doing a search. But they can only do a search if they have some kind of evidence (to justify a search warrant), or if they're given permission. But not having a TV license isn't evidence of doing anything wrong - although the TV Licensing Authority does it's best to suggest that it is, of course.

Even if they could get search warrants on demand, the cost of doing searches is high, and the number of people they'd actually catch breaking the law is much smaller than you probably think. Don't forget, the TV Licensing authority has a habit of putting out stories with ""xxx people found not to have a TV license"" which is probably right, but if you read carefully, there's no indication that any of them were watching or recording live TV. Propoganda stories, IOW.

So really, there's no reasonable way they can do their job - they have no choice but to resort to unreasonable ways.

And the thing is these real people *choose* to remain in that job. They could find another job. They could refuse to take part in repeated harassment on the grounds that it's illegal. They don't.

Even so, I look at the people more or less the way I look at tele-sales people. They're just doing their job. That doesn't justify being offensive to them individually. Though it also doesn't mean they have a right to my time or respect either.

The organisation as a whole, though, is a different thing. It has earned disrespect by it's actions. That's not just my opinion - the courts have said much the same thing.

The benefit that the BBC provides to the UK's creative industries is simply incalculable.

Now, in today's second Series 7 episdoe, ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship,"" Rory's father mentions Christmas lists again.

It's obvious that the 2012 Christmas special, which formally introduces the new companion played by Jenna-Louise Coleman (seen in AotD as ""Oswin Oswald,"" and who instructed the Doctor - and us - to ""remember me""), is clearly an important episode.

Ironically_Hipster pointed this out, and she's/he's right: I should.

Well, where to begin? OK the idea was awesome. Dinosaurs? On a spaceship? WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG? I feel like the writer relied on that as an excuse to have **bad writing.** Firstly, Rory's Dad: He was just transported from the ponds' living room to the TARDIS to a spaceship with dinosaurs on it. you'd think he'd react more than just: 'Oh, this is a bit weird, what's going on? Oh OK then.' And to top it off, Rory just briefly mentions that Amy and him have been travelling all over space and time with the madman in a box. You'd think that'd be more of a plot point, maybe have some dialogue between him and Rory and Amy about keeping secrets from them or something? No? OK, fine.

Next, we have the appearance of the dinosaurs yadda yadda yadda they get teleported to the beach, all the while Rory's Dad (Terrible actor imo) is still shockingly calm. If I was him I'd be freaking the fuck out right now. On a spaceship? With dinosaurs? And now we're on a beach? WHAT???? Yet he just stood there dumbfounded and said ""We're on a beach"". right now the Doctor's freaking out much more than him.

Then we get to the robots. This could've been really good. Have the famous comedy duo Mitchell and Webb voice some security robots? THINK OF THE DIALOGUE! Unfortunately, they didn't. Most of the time you heard Mitchell, I recall hearing Webb clearly about 3 or 4 times. even though you heard him more, Mitchell's lines were terrible! They could've bounced witty one-liners against eachother, but instead it was: ""you're going on the naughty step!"" Which just made me cringe.

Also, Amy knows how to navigate around a Silurian ship's computers apparently. I know she put it down to ""pressing buttons"" but she seemed pretty confident while doing it and there wasn't a hint of surprise when she actually got it to work. 

Then we get to the injured person (I don't think his name was ever mentioned.) and the plot suddenly grows darker. The doctor magically knows how to fix him even though he's not a real Doctor and the look on his face when he found out he was expected to fix him read: 'Oh. I don't know how to do this.'. But then not too soon after the plot reverts suddenly back to 'WHEE DINOSAURS' as The Doctor, Rory and his Dad ride a dinosaur as it chases an infinitely, perfectly directed golf ball while the two robots who were acting like bad babysitters, have a deadly weapon and then **miss all** of their shots. just general things I hate about TV and films there.

The gang reunites and the Lestrade actor suddenly knows how to use a futuristic stun gun even though he comes from **1902**. This action sequence lasts about about 3 seconds and cuts back later to all of the raptors dead. it felt like they wanted to squeeze in a bit of action in there. In fact, it feels like they wanted to squeeze a bit of **everything** in there. They wrote mediocre drama, comedy, action, flirty, scary and CGI bits and mashed them all together thinking that 'DINOSAURS ON A SPACESHIP' will be the cement that holds it together to form a good Who episode. They were wrong (IMO).

Whatever, then the Doctor kills someone.

Wait, what?

The Doctor, KILLS SOMEONE?

Yes. He. Does. Throughout the series the one motto the Doctor has gone by is 'Don't kill people'. He gets very angry when anyone apart from maybe the Daleks dies. Even earlier on in the episode he mentioned 'I liked you until you said missiles' and then uses those *same* missiles to be responsible to the death of someone. Not only is this so incredibly out of character, they don't even acknowledge it! you'd think that when the Doctor did kill someone, it'd be in an epic and dark episode where the Doctor is in some badass ultra-extreme anger mode, AND THEN REFERENCE IT LATER. Instead he continues to be his cheery self throughout the remainder of the episode despite breaking his most important rule. IT'S JUST BAD WRITING. THEY SEEM TO NOT CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS AT ALL.

God-fucking-damnit.

TL;DR: they relied to much on dinosaurs which mad them slack on writing. I didn't enjoy. Maybe you did. If you did, I'm jealous because you onviously had a far more enjoyable time than me.

**OPINIONS**

Edit 3: OK after seeing some threads I've concluded that the killing  wasn't as out of character as I had said, however. I think it was poorly executed compared to some of the other killings and could've been done much better. Alot of the killings (such as that spider-queen thing from the christmas special) were done reeeeaaaly well. It was dramatic and intense. this one just felt like, 'haha now you're dead'. which isn't very who-style.",0,1347132656,null,0,1347140433,0,c65czbx,t3_zkfzm,t1_c65czbx,t3_zkfzm,null,1429850273,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

true,acoustic_wave,tennant,Tennant,"Let's review her points, shall we?

&gt;1) Skaro was destroyed in the Time War ‚Äì which is to say, declared nonexistent and irretrievable ‚Äì and nobody mentions this.

Rebuttal: ~~As far as I can tell, this is correct. I was going to say something about how Maybe the Daleks chose another world and named it Skaro, but he said in the episode that it was ""The homeworld of the Daleks"" So this is a valid point.~~ EDIT(Thanks to ProtoKun7): Skaro was actually destroyed in Remembrance of the Daleks, not in the Time War. It's possible that the destruction was reversed or happened in the far future (it was still around right at the end of the Seventh Doctor and he'd already destroyed it by then), or there is the retcon that Antalin was destroyed instead. Nothing specified that Skaro was destroyed in the War.

&gt;2) The Daleks were destroyed in the Time War ‚Äì meaning they can only show up if they‚Äôre listed as having escaped it somehow, which these ones aren‚Äôt ‚Äì and nobody mentions this.

Rebuttal: The time we saw the Daleks before this was in ""Victory of the Daleks"" at the end of which, the five ""new Daleks"" went off into space. We haven't seen them since then so is it not possible that they bred?

&gt;3) Apparently there are human prison camps on Skaro ‚Äì even though it‚Äôs the Dalek homeworld and they exist to exterminate, not enslave ‚Äì and nobody mentions this.

Rebuttal: The entire scene with the mother was a ploy by the Daleks in order to get the Doctor.

&gt;4) Daleks are not their armour ‚Äì making the eystalk and laser combination seem deeply weird as a means of indicating Dalek control ‚Äì and nobody mentions this.

Rebuttal: Daleks are not defined by their armor; however, if you were in the Daleks place, would you not be confused by the humans having two eyes when you only have one? And don't you want to arm your puppet with something so you can defend yourself while operating it?

&gt;5) Daleks are obsessed with their own genetic perfection: we‚Äôve had multiple episodes detailing their disgust for human impurity, to the point of committing genocide against a human-Dalek hybrid race, and yet apparently they‚Äôre OK with manipulating human corpses and putting the resultant hybrid entities in positions of command ‚Äì and nobody mentions this.

Rebuttal: The mother was not in a position of command, she was a secretary. If you were opening up a business in a different country, wouldn't you want the secretary to be someone local?

&gt;6) Thousands of Daleks, their entire Parliament, the ship in which they reside and the asylum planet have all apparently survived the Time War, even though this is pretty much impossible ‚Äì and nobody mentions this.

Rebuttal: The Asylum Planet was a legend, the Time Lords didn't know of it to attack it. The planet, it is safe to assume, was never involved in the war. For the Daleks, Parliament, and ships, see my rebuttal to point no.2

&gt;7) The Daleks want the Doctor to help them because they‚Äôre all afraid of the asylum inhabitants ‚Äì and this is treated as normal, instead of absolutely mind-blowing.

Rebuttal: When was this treated as normal?

&gt;8) The Doctor is called ‚Äòthe Predator of the Daleks‚Äô, a name he‚Äôs never heard before, even though he‚Äôs known in their mythology as the Oncoming Storm ‚Äì and nobody mentions this.

Rebuttal: At the end of the episode, when they're all asking ""Doctor Who?"" over and over again, he does indeed tell them that he is the oncoming storm. And earlier, when he was first called the Predator, he was utterly surprised that they called him that. As he had never heard it before.

&gt;9) At no point is the Doctor or anyone else surprised to see so many Daleks roaming about ‚Äì and nobody mentions this.

Rebuttal: See point no. 2

&gt;10) At no point does the Doctor rail against the existence of the Daleks or even contemplate refusing to help ‚Äì and nobody mentions this.

Rebuttal: The Doctor is very curious and helpful by nature. Also, if he didn't help, then some Daleks might still be able to escape the Asylum. And remember that these Daleks are the baddest of the bad. It's in his best interest to help and he knows it.

&gt;Even ignoring the overall continuity questions this raises (how did the crazy Daleks manage it? where did they get the facilities? why and how was she allowed to retain her human personality?)

Rebuttal: The nanogenes from the Asylum probably had a code in them to recognize when to do a full conversion and they know how to, otherwise they wouldn't be nanogenes. However, technology has been known to screw up, so they accidentally forgot to erase the love.

&gt;there‚Äôs a massive goof in the fact that, when the Doctor reaches her, she‚Äôs shown as a Dalek chained in a room: her speaking voice is a Dalek voice, and she has no visible access to anything. How, then, has she been speaking to the Doctor in a voice that was recognisibly that of  a human girl? Where did the opera music come from? Why is she chained up, forgotten and unguarded, if the point of making her Dalek was to orchestrate an escape? How is she controlling everything when she doesn‚Äôt have any access to the asylum‚Äôs systems ‚Äì or at least, no access that we can see? How does any of this work?

Rebuttal: Daleks are telepathic. All of their systems are telepathic. If she imagines herself speaking with a human voice, then over the PA system she will sound human. She also controls everything and hacks into everything using her mind.",0,1347133248,null,0,1347136382,0,c65d3yo,t3_zk1pv,t1_c65d3yo,t3_zk1pv,null,1429850328,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

Why would you assume that? I mean there's only one Doctor. I wouldn't be opposed to either of those scenarios you mentioned. I wouldn't be opposed to Matt Smith's Doctor regenerating into a female either. I can't say whether I would like the show as much with a female Doctor, but I'm not trying to say that they shouldn't do it. As a fan, I don't see it as being my place to tell the writers how to do their jobs. All I can say is what I like, and what I don't like. I'm not going to tell them that they should or should not do anything.

If the writers decide to do a show with a female Doctor, or a Doctor of a different race, that's fine by me. However, judging from the pattern so far, I see no reason to think they're going to do either.

Really I shouldn't have said my answer was ""nay"". Because, I wouldn't say that there SHOULDN'T be a female Doctor. I just don't have any specific desire to see one. I'm not opposed to the idea. 

There's a big difference between someone saying they would like to see a female doctor, and saying ""there should be a female doctor"". The former is just a statement of personal preference, the latter is a prescription. There's nothing wrong with saying it, but if someone is going to try and say that they know how the show should be, then I think they're obliged to give some reasons.",0,1347136164,null,0,1347137553,0,c65dq4t,t3_zipmo,t1_c65dq4t,t1_c654opm,null,1429850613,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

The Daleks aren't rational, but delusional hate machines. Whenever they've had Hybrids around they ended up killing them or ordering them to self-destruct as soon as they could. I mean, wanting to exterminate everything that isn't Dalek is kind of the point of being a Dalek. If they stop doing that, then they don't really have any defining features left, I think. 

That said, for point 7), it wasn't exactly treated as normal, but it was made to appear much less mind-blowing than it actually would be. I mean, they killed and caused so. much. suffering. The Doctor lost *everything* partly because of them. 9 *hated* them. 10 did, too, and 11 was freaking out so much that they *still* weren't dead in the WW2 episode that he couldn't even think clearly while they were there. He was also terribly angry that they *dared* to pretend to be helpful servants to the British when they were the most disgusting monsters in the universe in reality.

true,pbhj,uk,.,"IANAL but I thought I'd look at the statutes involved to see if the claim in the blog post is evident. Caselaw is king however so if the claim is based on caselaw it won't necessarily be clear from reading the statute and regulations. But here goes ...

**Statute links**

If anyone's interested the relevant statute appears to be the Communications Act 2003 Part 4 Sections 363-368, http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/part/4.

**Entry to premises**

FWIW S.364(3)(a) makes it explicit that the BBC can't [lawfully] authorise entry to premises. S.366 concerns the issue of warrants by which the courts can authorise a BBC representative to use ""reasonable force"" to enter premises with or without police present.

IIRC last year they changed the definition of reasonable force (in respect of repossession at least) to include damage to property.

**Establishment of regulations within the Act**

S.363(6) makes it clear that there are separate rules that make certain exemptions (they do this as rules can be modified without needing an act of parliament to be passed). 

The rules are The Communications (Television Licensing) Regulations 2004, http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2004/692/introduction/made; but note they're amended regularly so there will be recent amendments (eg to change the TV License charge).

**Rules relevant to watching TV on a laptop/tablet**

The relevant parts of the Regulations appear to be Rule 9 ('Meaning of ‚Äútelevision receiver‚Äù' which in part refers us back to Part 3 of the Act) and the details of the license issued as in Schedule 1 row 2 ('TV licence (including colour) General Form').

So Rule 9(1) &amp; 9(2): &lt;-- turned out not to be informative.

Perhaps we can skip this and assume we know what a ""television programme service"" is!?!

So then we've got the Schedule which tells us with the standard license (of ¬£121) you get the following licensed rights:

* *(a)to install and use television receivers at the single place specified in the licence or, as the case may be, in the single vehicle, vessel or caravan so specified (‚Äúthe specified location‚Äù);*

* *(b)to install and use television receivers in any vehicle, vessel or caravan being used or occupied by the licensee or by a person normally living with the licensee at the specified location, being installation or use not covered by a licence described in Schedule 5, provided that a receiver may not be used in a caravan, other than a touring caravan, at the same time as a receiver is being used at the specified location; and*

* *(c)for the use anywhere of any television receiver powered solely by its own internal batteries by the licensee or by a person normally living with the licensee at the specified location.*

This appears to say that if you normally live with the license holder (being a student wouldn't apply unless you're living at home) then your fine as long as your in a car, caravan (but not a static one), boat, etc.. OR if the device is powered ""solely by its own internal batteries"". A laptop wouldn't be excluded as it gets plugged in to mains power at some time (hence not ""solely"" powered by internal batteries).

There is also a multiple license that makes it clear that multiple locations attract multiple fees of ¬£121.

**tl;dr in summary - watch live TV on your laptop in your student digs and you need a license.**

They don't even consider the prisoners there ""Daleks"" anymore. They would never actually accept a converted organism into their race because they're purists.

Up until this episode they really just set up the planet and then pretend it never existed because they hate to think that members of their own race became imperfect. They don't want anything leaving the planet, and they don't care what they have to do to keep it that way as long as they never have to acknowledge it's existence.

In any other situation though, such as a war or something, the Daleks would never convert enemies into Dalek-like allies. They only exterminate. If anything, this didn't mess with Dalek logic, it enhanced it. It showed that the Daleks routinely cast out members of their own race to ensure that they are pure as a species. The only reason they didn't exterminate them too is out of respect for what they once were.

Obviously, in this episode, the Daleks have realized that it's possible for ""inmates"" to escape. Fearing this, they decide to destroy the planet, even if it means exterminating former members of their species which still have their respect. From now on, I assume, the Daleks will exterminate the imperfect rather than starting another, possibly escapable, asylum.",0,1347139923,null,0,false,0,c65ehyy,t3_zk3sc,t1_c65ehyy,t3_zk3sc,null,1429850979,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

&gt;You do not need a TV licence if you only use a TV to listen to digital radio broadcasts and not watch or record television programmes as they are being shown. **However, TV Licensing should be notified if this is the case. One of their enforcement officers may then visit to confirm that a license is not needed. [...]**

This sort of excision of key detail generally means someone is trying to misrepresent the situation IME.

Note that this letter will not have the force of law as the Act and Regulations do. Mandarins working in Bristol can't overrule parliament. You say that ""the BBC decides under what conditions a license is required"". But this is not what the Act you quote says. The Act says that the BBC can add *restrictions and conditions* to the issue of a license (S.364(1)(a)) and [non-exhaustively] mentions some situations in which additional restrictions and conditions may be applied. Removing the need to have a license when a receiver is installed would not be putting a restriction or condition on that clause - the BBC's letter is *ultra vires*.

Note that we can tell quite clearly that the BBC letter is wrong as blind people are required to have a license and yet under the reading of this letter if you do not *watch* then you don't need a license. Note that the Act uses the term ""use"" a television receiver.

The letter is addressed to an individual and this part says ""you"". Not ""one"" or ""A person"" or similar wording that would show a general application. We can say however that ""should be notified"" carries no weight in strict terms; but this letter is not written in strict legal terms and so the requirement or otherwise is also unclear.

IMO hhmmmm is exactly right but the enforcement of the law and the requirements of the law are two different things (as he notes).

http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/for-your-home/students-aud1/ makes it quite clear that a student can't rely on a parent's license, it would be a fraud for TV Licensing to misrepresent this situation. If you genuinely think that they are doing so then contact the BBC, BBC Trust, Trading Standards or Ofcom; Citizens Advice should be able to help you with your case.

So, I find the current situation normal and satisfying (FUCKING DINOSAURS IN A SPACESHIP), because obviously Doctor has an idea about the Ponds' leaving. So, obviously they are just focusing on one specific big ball of feelings. If he merged this with a main storyline which will continue AFTER the Ponds event, it would have been a disaster (harsh word choice, I know, but still... You get the point). I think Moffat is being kind to us, and respectful to the Ponds with this episode type. They were with us for the past 2,2 years and we enjoyed it very much. A proper send off is needed, not just an absorbing storyline. Tears will be shed, hopefully water. (Tears are actually shedding right now, at least on my part.

Actually, I think there's something up with Amy and the Doctor's relationship (not romantically, of course). It reminds of me of the Doctor-Donna -- like Amy's taking responsibility somehow. Their intense discussion as the Doctor jumped back towards 'Phase 1' of his save-the-day plan seemed to suggest that only one of the two of them might make it out by the end of the series. (Harry Potter / Voldemort prophecy, anyone?) Then again, the Doctor did criticize us for thinking in such a 'linear' manner -- maybe we're seeing things out of order?

Brian was kind of in the middle confused but willing to follow the lead of his son because he saw how much Rory and Amy trusted the Doctor. This episode could have done without Brian but he added some nice comedy.

2) The robots were bad.

3) The ships computers were mainly voice activated/guided. I'm guessing they either had translation software or the TARDIS was able to translate what Amy said to Silurian. She didn't have to do much other than wake it up and poke around. 

4) The Doctor has been around for nearly 1000 years, I'm sure he does know how to do some medical stuff.

5) The ball was just a way to get Tricey to run. Didn't matter where it went as long as it got them away from the robots. The robots missing every shot was bad but that's typical TV/movie writing (bad guys almost never have good aim).

6) He killed a genocidal pirate that was more than happy to kidnap Nefertiti and leave the dinos and the Doctor and his companions to die. If Soloman had shown mercy at any point the Doctor may have been kinder. He knew if he let Soloman stay that he would just be trouble.

7) The 'futuristic' stun guns were designed very similarly to a rifle of his time. You load, point and shoot.

Whereas in the then government (now opposition) everyone knew their place, Malcolm would come in and shit on everyone. Ollie for instance would only ever put down people who were subordinate or equal to him.

And one of the ideas they played with in the episode was of how similar Rory and his Dad were. Not enough to be a theme, but definitely a recurring element - Brian carries a trowel, Rory carries nursing supplies; ""Spelling it out plainly is hereditary, wonderful!"", and so on.

I think I have to rewatch it, maybe I won't be that beaten by things then.

And I'm unsure about Saul Metzstein's work. It was too often the ""I am the Doctor"" camera angle, not sure how to call it. It's the Doctor standing and the camera zooms to his face a little bit from the buttom. Or was it just imagination?

That doesn't appear to be true. Unless you can convince the court that you are resident in your parent's house (or a house covered by a license) and not resident in your student accommodation.

See NUS for confirmation - http://www.nus.org.uk/cy/news/news/cash-back---tv-licensing-refund-for-students-/. If there was a legal exclusion for living in halls of residence then the NUS would absolutely be touting it (that's not scientific proof but, meh).

As you can see, with regards to rainfall, Germany and the UK are fairly similar in summer.

I live in Berlin. It's summer now here, we get so much rain in the summer. The weather is almost exactly the same as the UK, except it's colder in winter Berlin and in Hamburg and the far north it rains more than London. 

Example of this weeks weather in Summer Berlin:

Today it was foggy and cold, Monday it's going to be 29C clear and sunny Wednesday it's going to be 16C and stormy. Very consistent indeed...


[**Source: BBC**](http://i.imgur.com/EI6Lj.png)

In London it's going to be 28C on Sunday then 2 days later its going to be cold and rainy. Because, as I said, the weather is the similar in Britain as Northern Europe. I don't know why we British think we have some magical special weather....


Northern Germany is famed for its inconsistent weather.

By the way, the rainiest city in Europe is in Germany.

Moffat is revisiting the theme from the very first 11/Amy episode, where he goes away, and returns, only to discover that decades have passed for Amy. This is the recurring theme for these five episodes.

The fact that he always returns them home at the end of each episode, and then picks them up again after a gap (10 months this time?).

I think the leaving of the Ponds will simply be that he is returning after a longer and longer gap (from the Pond's perspective), and doesn't even realise it. By ep 5, the gap will have been decades, and Amy and Rory will be old. Maybe Rory will even be dead by that point. {Note: Not Amy. It has to end with Amy}.

I don't think so. Notice the subtle things being dropped in every episode. Christmas has been mentioned twice now, and a trailer confirms it will be mentioned in the next episode too. Obviously The Doctor being forgotten is something that's going to happen *often*, as it's also happened twice now, once in each episode.

I mean, watch his reaction to Oswin...until he decides to appeal to the ""human"" aspect of her (in self-preservation, rather than real compassion, it seems), he gets his ""anti-Dalek attitude"".  In a sense, his rejection almost pushes her to accept her Dalek nature, which has overarching connections with how the Daleks get stronger in fear of the Doctor.

true,terrible20somethings,tardis,TARDIS,"Some things to keep in mind while decorating a room around a theme:

* While Tardis blue is a lovely shade, it is a strong, vibrant colour and pretty dark. Consider the lighting you have in that room and the window placements (if you do have any) when deciding to paint. Darker colours are also known to make a room appear smaller, painting one or two walls allows the theme to be set without overpowering the room. If you've got baseboards, paint 'em white.
* Flooring should really be up to you, as it's your feet that are most likely going to be traversing it most often. Personally, I'm partial to hardwood flooring, and I understand there is now snap-together panels that are both easy to install and not ridiculously expensive. Go for a light shade to help balance out the blue. **OR** light grey carpeting, for the idea of the Tardis grating (I *know* the grating is black, but again, dark colours).
* Are you focused on decorating with only Matt's seasons, all of New Who or all of Who? Pick an item or favourite quote from a favourite episode to frame and hang.
* If you've got a spare corner, you can set up a miniature Tardis console with some styrofome balls, spray paint [and a lamp like this](http://www.lightinguniverse.com/floor-lamps/neonetics-4bblrk-illuminated-rocket-bubbling-water-floor-lamp_g938041.html)
* Police Public Call Box can be border for the blue walls, but you can have cutouts of various characters and monsters and creatures from DW as the rest of the room's border.
* If you have a clothing collection in common with the Doctor (hats, jackets, coats, scarves, etc...), display them on one wall with several hooks. A possible quote could be ""Accessories are cool"", either painted on the wall or framed and hung over the hooks.
* Buy some space sheets
* The Doctor takes us to some pretty fabulous places in Time and Space, if you have an interest in any of that, maybe an item or two can be displayed on your shelves or bookcase.

Make sure the end result is something you are happy with. Good luck and keep us posted!",0,1347147603,null,0,false,0,c65g3zh,t3_zkfwt,t1_c65g3zh,t3_zkfwt,null,1435685189,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

As for the Sycorax. He was about to attack the Doctor. The Doctor was defending himself.

Whereas Solomon was no longer a threat to anyone. All he wanted to do was leave.

The Doctor purposefully chose to kill him in cold blood.

No.  It's not as though the teabag has a different flavour to the tea-flavoured water.  When you pour in milk, the thicker liquid actually clogs up the little holes in the teabag, making it harder for the flavour to infuse.  Also, adding milk cools the water slightly, which means the teabag isn't brewed at as hot a temperature as it should!

Anyway, I do not have sugar in my tea.  But you know that if the water is still scalding when you take out the teabag, all you have to do is give the teaspoon a shake, and the heat of the metal makes the spoon dry.

Yes, they were plotholes and truly unexplained actions, like, how come Amy knows hot to operate the computer SO easily? How come mr Weasley... I mean mr Pond... I mean mr Williams didn't have at least thirteen heart attacks because of all the action going around him?

I sometimes find it very difficult to believe a character would suddenly just jump into the action and start doing everything as planned. But, somehow, in this episode it works. Maybe it's to much going around so that the logic is thrown out of the window? 

Or maybe its because of my [new favourite scene?](http://piotrmil.tumblr.com/post/31154119966/i-do)

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ill answer these Q's but I did this an ama maybe 6 or so months ago and somebody revealed my identity (very uncool)

I was in the Academy for 5 years before a bad injury forced me out, 21 now, still could go pro but for in a lower division and work my way up.

-------------------

1: *What was it like being in the Academy?*

Scary. Every, single, day is terrifying. You always have to prove yourself, your always being tested, always watched, always pushing yourself. Its 110% at all times. 

The academy sorted out all of our education so it was a bit like boarding school, normally there are twenty boys in each year group but we had 18. 

You train everyday, you eat specific food, bed by 8, 10 on weekends, different rules applied for guys who lived at home with their families, they could do what they want.

TABS. Technique, Attitude, Balance and Speed, get used to this saying because they wouldnt shut the fuck up about it.

-----------------

2: *Do you feel like becoming a professional footballer was a realistic option?* 

Yes. You had to believe you could make it or you may have well just go home. It really is 90% mental 10% skill, while the majority of guys were playing games and watching TV the real hardcore would be in the gym training technique and drills.

-----------------------------------

3: *Where are you now in your footballing carrer or lack there of?*

I broke my ankle at 17 and It took 3 years for it to recover.

It was tough because not long after I recovered and started training again I broke my shoulder In a freak accident, which cost me another year.

My speed, agility, balance and coordination is nowhere near the level it once was but compared to 90% of the people I play Im Suarez. 

-------------------------------------

4: *What players were in the same year as you that are now professionals?*

A lot of guys never made the prem, LFC was TERRIBLE for brining players through but they are not to blame because when your a big team like LFC the first team is always going to be extremely talented and competitive to get into.

99% of the guys I played with are now in the championship, league 1 or abroad. 

Some of the best players I knew at youth level requested transfers to other academy's because they knew they had a better chance of getting into the first team.

Didnt really speak to them much but Nathan Eccleston, Daniel Pacheco, Jay 'Papa smurf' Spearing, Martin Kelly, I knew Sterling and Flanagan, Morgan..but they played under us so we never really spoke.

-----------------------------------------

5: *Do you regret ever going to the Academy to begin with instead of going to school like the majority of kids?*

I left a lot of great friends behind, it was kinda like being in the army because it was pretty strict and the training was full on but then your life was just consumed by football..all day, everyday, football, football, football, everything you did was football related. Some guys quit literately because they were sick to fucking death of playing and training.",0,1347150407,null,0,false,0,c65goji,t3_zkg34,t1_c65goji,t1_c65fe1b,null,1429852057,18,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,18

true,MrHaHaHaaaa,eng-essex,Bemused,"1. If you watch live broadcast TV you need to buy a TV licence.
2. If you have a TV you do not need to buy a TV licence unless you use it to indulge in 1 above.
3. If you have a PC or a laptop you do not need to buy a TV licence unless you use it to indulge in 1 above.
4. If you use a mobile device (eg phone) the device may be exempt. 
That is what the law says. It doesn't matter what equipment you own, it's what you do with it that matters. And it doesn't matter what you watch or what channel, if it's live it needs a licence.

So, how do they enforce the law?
The BBC use Capita to run TVLicensing for them.
It is important you understand that TVLicensing have no powers at all. Yes that's right, they have NO powers at all. Unless, and they must do this before they turn up at your door,  they obtain a warrant from the magistrates court. 
 

Without a warrant-
They have no power to demand entry to your home.
They have no power to demand you answer their questions.
They have no power to demand you open your door to them or talk to them.
They have no power to demand you give them your name or any other information.
They have no power to demand you sign anything.
They have no right to remain on your premises. 
 

Even with a warrant- 
They have no power to demand you answer their questions.
They have no power to demand you talk to them.
They have no power to demand you give them your name or any other information.
They have no power to demand you sign anything. 
 

In other words, they have no more powers than a doorstep seller or a jehovas witless.  Bear that in mind, should they come knocking.

Doesn't this make it rather difficult to enforce the law?
Don't underestimate the power of bluff.
TVLicensing rely upon bluff and people's ignorance, if they act as if they have special powers the credulous will believe they do.
And it works, the vast majority of convictions are the consequence of people willingly signing statements admitting their guilt.

But what of those who like me who think broadcast TV is a crock of shit and happily go without?
Well, I can tell you what happens-
 

1. I get monthly threatening letters addressed to 'The Legal Occupier'. (They don't know who I am because I won't tell them.)
 

2. I get visits from TVLicensing. If they are wearing their silly uniform I can see who they are so I don't answer the door.
 

(In the past 3 years I have been visited 4 or 5 times, when I was at home)
If they are in normal clothes I may well answer the door and a conversation like this will take place-
 

BBC: Are you the occupier? 

Me:  Who are you?
(This may be repeated until they give up) 

BBC: TVLicensing. 

Me: Good day to you/I don't have to talk to you. 

Then I shut the door.

I find that refusing to engage with them at all works best. Some might argue that telling them I don't watch TV would be better.
But if I did that I would still get a visit to 'confirm what I had said' and after a while it would all start again.

The Doctor had a choice to make, target a ship with a man that had committed what the Doctor had described as a genocide, who also killed a dinosaur in cold blood and tried to kidnap and sell the Queen, or his new friends, companions, Rory's dad and a bunch of dinosaurs. He couldn't just put the little device outside of the window, it wouldn't float away fast enough or at all considering it is in Space.

The Doctor would choose to save his friends and innocent creatures every time over a character like Solomon and that's not as out of character as some believe either.

9 is perhaps more of a pacifist because he is tired of war, but he almost made his final act killing all humans in future earth along with the Daleks.  ",0,1347153482,null,0,false,0,c65hbf6,t3_zkk40,t1_c65hbf6,t1_c65dxsj,null,1429852374,15,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,15

true,slightlyKiwi,cyberman,Cyberperson,"My favourite reason goes thus:

""Once upon a time there was a hermit.

He never talked much about why he was one, but he was.  Some people said there was a woman...or a whole bunch of weird sisters, depending on who you believe.  But no matter who or what brought it on, he knew he didn't want to live the life he was meant to.  The life his name and address had laid out for him long before he was born.

All he really wanted to do was wander the world, and forget all the responsibilities his name carried, and meet all the people he could never get to see otherwise.

Well all right, he was a very social hermit.

But before he left home, he broke his name.  Broke it into thirty eight tiny pieces.  It made a lovely shattering sound, like a wineglass tossed into a fireplace.

He swept up all the pieces of who he was and tucked them away in an inside pocket.  And over the years, as he met people who ended up sharing the road with him for while, he would quietly give each of them a piece of his name.

And once they went their separate ways, his name continued to grow within them, and made them into something better, something bigger, than they were before.

Or just something different.

Most of the time he didn't think about what grew as he passed.  Most of the time he didn't know.  But he did know that, with all the jigsaw pieces of his name scattered about, they wouldn't be able to get all of him when they came to take him away.""

-&gt; [spoiler](#s ""Amy points out that the Doctor might live to see them die instead of the other way around."")

-&gt; [What I think is truly happening:](#s ""Solomon has delivered the most precious cargo to Earth in episode six. The Weeping Angels in his attempt to destroy Earth, The Doctor's favorite 'home' because of the events to come in an episode in the second half of Series 7 where The Doctor has stopped Solomon for the first time. Solomon for revenge brings the Angels to Manhattan where in the end they kill Amy/Rory. Solomon's legs actually are injured in that episode by the Angels backfiring on him. The Doctor has been annoying the Ponds months at a time because he's not ready to let them go, much like a parent who coddles their child as they leave for school on the first day/move out on their own/get married/etc. He's been living his life in reverse of Amy/Rory knowing the further he goes back in their time, the further away from their fate he tries to run from. Him 'killing' Solomon in this episode is his revenge. Solomon, may actually turn out to be another renegade Time Lord out for profit because of The Doctor not recognizing him, so maybe the injury instead caused him to regenerate and told the truth of the dinosaurs gnawing at his legs. At the end of the episode, we see Solomon looking back at a monitor curiously but in fear, The Doctor may have actually frightened him with a possibility of him dying by missiles, but teleports him away to safety to prove he's better. And in Series 7's finale, we'll see The Doctor encountering Solomon for the final time while Solomon is imprisoned in Stormcage by River Song. We know River appears this Series in episode six, but who's to say she wasn't given her cell based on wanting to be beside Solomon's to remind him of The Doctor's victory over him constantly?

Davros (of all people) explained it best in JE when he said ""The man who abhors violence, never carrying a gun. But this is the truth, Doctor. You take ordinary people and you fashion them into weapons."" 

Most of the things listed in OP's post involve *other people* killing the Doctor's enemies. Perhaps the Doctor instigated these murders, but didn't commit them himself, and therefore can't be used in the argument about Solomon.

Now let's take a look at the ones he did kill.

* The Timelords and the Daleks - the choice here was basically: the destruction of his people and the Daleks or the destruction of the entire universe. I can't really fault him on that decision.
* The Sycorax leader - this is probably the best look into why the Doctor killed Solomon. At least in his 10th incarnation, he was a ""no second chances"" kind of man. In Dinosaurs on a Spaceship, the Doctor gave Solomon *plenty* of chances to do the right thing and Solomon threw all of those chances in the Doctor's face. The difference is that the Sycorax leader was charging towards the Doctor swinging a gigantic sword. Solomon was just stuck on his spaceship and left to die.
* The Racnoss Queen - I think we can all agree that the Doctor was not in a right state of mind in this episode. He had literally just said goodbye to Rose and was a giant machine of angst and hate and pain. And of course if Donna hadn't stopped him, he would have died right along with the Racnoss.

It's sad, but that's becoming the norm around this site.

EDIT: Actually, no, fuck that. Do you know what I mean by ""perfect example,"" you semi-literate troll? I don't mean ""perfect"" as in flawless or without defect, I mean ""perfect"" as in having all the necessary, required qualities and characteristics. 

Let's take a simple example to analogize this for you: A golf ball. Imagine it in your mind. Is it round, white, and have little divots all over it? Probably. That's a perfect example of a golf ball. It doesn't mean it is perfect as in the best in the world, it means perfect as in it has all the necessary and required characteristics.

Okay, quitting now, because I feel like I've been trolled, and I put this deeper explanation for anyone else who might come across it, not the person trying to get a rise out of me.

Secondly, you're conflating actors, and their roles, with fiction. In the mythology of the series, sure, they're the same 'person.' But in reality, they're not. The writers change, the actors change, the cinematography, editing, music, etc. 

The show has a few McGuffins and Phlebotinums that it brings along throughout the years (sonic screwdriver, Tardis, having a companion, etc), sure. But beyond that each incarnation is unique and individual.

However, it seems strange to not be able to say ""I like how this actor played this role better than any other actor."" And maybe I'm wrong, but is that what you're trying to do, here? Because there's only ""one doctor"" can a viewer not have an opinion on who was the best? Man, the Tom Baker fans are going to be *pissed* when they find out they aren't supposed to have a favorite.

No. To try and foreclose a statement of opinion about the best actor/personification of the doctor (if you like that better) in some sort of ""they're all the same person, really"" argument is... well, it's silly.

I, like previous Doctors, don't like weapons too much and I won't carry one around with me. However, I'll pick one up if I need to, without much of a fuss.

I'm very sarcastic, and I oftentimes get very smart-ass with my companions. Unlike previous Doctors, I'm straightforward and basic with my escapades. I.E. If there's an army of aliens that are going to enslave Earth, my plan of action will be as follows:

1. Try to reason with them. If this fails...

2. Give UNIT/Torchwood the okay and we *blow those motherfuckers out of the sky.* They had their chance.

I'm not emotional at all. I don't form the kind of bonds with my companions that I did with Rose. They're freinds, accomplices, assistants, pals, partners. No more. If they die, I'll get upset and brood for a day or two cooped up in my TARDIS, but then I'm off again and don't cry or emote about it. This can cause some serious disconnects in humanity and morality, especially when it comes to fixed points. Waters of Mars would not have even happened, as I would have forcefully grabbed my suit and walked out.

I look quite similar to [this](http://i.imgur.com/ktbEd.png) (Which is another 12th Doctor interpretation by one BaldDumboRat), but my hair is slightly more black.

My signature outfit consists of:

-A fedora or bowler hat for special occasions. Either one.

-A pinstriped suit top not unlike Ten's, except black and with the buttons undone, revealing the undershirt.

-A plain black T-shirt underneath.

-Pinstriped suit pants.

-Black/gray shoes. Particularly the running type (Converse, tennis, doesn't really matter.)

-My sonic screwdriver gets an upgrade, its parts becoming darker and its porcelean grip getting a stony finish. Also, the light is changed from green to blue, [as shown](http://i.imgur.com/1O3m4.png). Maybe its claws are sharper and more defined.

Yes, each incarnation is unique and individual... so how can there be a quintessential Doctor?

But I think you're overestimating Solomon. He doesn't strike me as more than a basic evil bad guy. I think if a villain with a multi-episode plot arc were introduced, he wouldn't be an a-hole right off the bat. That just doesn't seem to be the writers' style, nor should it be. Multi-episode villains should be more complex than that. 


In a similar vein, I doubt the angels will kill the Ponds. If it looks this obvious three episodes out, I think we can safely assume that something else will happen.

His greatest fear is himself. I think that has been quite evident throughout most of his lifetime, but especially in the new series. In his 8th incarnation, he committed genocide, on two species- Daleks and his own people. He dealt with the PTSD of that during his 9th and 10th incarnations, and we see him very nearly lose control of his anger several times (the arachne queen, and Time Lord Victorious), and in fact lose and act on it: ""No second chances. That's the kind of man I am."" 

In his 11th incarnation, he has, or at least is making progress toward, learned to live with himself and what he knows he is capable of, but the anger is always there, just below the surface, and sometimes he gives into it a little bit. Going full out crazy, like the Master, or Rassilon, is what he fears the most.

The only aspect of the committee that might change due to deadline day is Ian Ayre's role in it.

The reason it hasn't happened until now has much to do with the fact that two people who we know will be on the committee, ex-City scouts Dave Fallows and Barry Hunter, have been on gardening leave as part of their termination of contract with City; that gardening leave lasted until the end of the summer transfer window (clever City), and in his recent interview with fanzines, etc., Rodgers said:

&gt; ‚ÄúAnd now, hopefully, this month our scouting team comes together""

It'll be interesting to see who else is on the committee, though. The chief administrator for negotiations will be a much-welcomed move, and I suspect that's the reason they won't remove Ian Ayre from MD, but rather will just remove certain MD responsibilities from Ian Ayre's brief.

Before you downvote me, consider this:

In *Day of the Moon* he transmitted a video of the Silence saying, ""You should kill us all on sight.""  So humanity started killing them all on sight.  The Doctor didn't kill any of them himself, but he's responsible for their deaths all the same.

In *The Doctor's Wife* he encouraged Sexy to kill The House.

He was responsible for the Saturines death in Vampire of Venice....

In his tenth incarnation he effectively guilt tripped that boy genius into sacrificing himself to blow up the Sontarians.

You see the transfer strategy devised by the Oakland A's was also adopted by the Boston Red Sox...who own Liverpool... so the strategy basically consists of buying wins, and goals.

It seems that more and more 11th is becoming more frustrated with people's crimes and seeks to be a police force instead of a pacifist. 9th was the War Veteran lost in his own internal struggles to which Rose helped bring him out of to see Hope in this universe. 10th was the one who believed he could make up for his crimes against species. But 11th has had enough of making amends and is tired of constantly losing the ones he cares about. I believe we may yet see 11th become a darker force.

true,Ezterhazy,null,null,"Hillsborough was an unsafe ground. Fans (of clubs other than Liverpool) were hospitalised due to crushing in the same Leppings Lane End at a couple of previous semi-finals in the 1980s. Despite this, Liverpool (with more fans in attendance) were allocated the smaller Leppings Lane End, partly because it would ease traffic congestion outside the ground.
Also, the safety certificate was out of date on the ground - something that was not picked up on by the police, the FA or the local authority.

The police, to make life easier for themselves, opened the gates before the game and let Liverpool fans in en masse. They then directed fans into parts of the Leppings Lane End that were already full - mirroring previous near-misses at the ground when fans were hospitalised.
An important fact to remember about this is that the Leppings Lane End wasn't at capacity when the disaster occurred. There were not too many fans trying to gain admittance and there wasn't any crowd trouble The problem was that the fans were directed by the police into the already full central pens and not to the sides of the stand which had capacity.

Afterwards, the police took part in a cover-up. Every police statement about the disaster was read and re-written by senior officers who were not present in order to lay the blame on the fans. Journalists and politicians were briefed by the police that the fans were to blame. The FA was told that fans had forced open the gate that the police themselves opened.

The Taylor Report criticised the police strongly. But Lord Justice Taylor wasn't aware when he wrote the report that police statements had been routinely falsified, so the Taylor Report does not take that into account.

Relevant sections of the Taylor Report about the fans:

On the ""late"" arrival of Liverpool fans
&gt;Whether those who arrived between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm were ""late"" was much debated. The ticket simply requested its holder ""to take up [his] position 15 minutes before kick-off. That may have been intended to persuade those with stand tickets to take their seats, but it would not be unreasonable for a standing spectator to arrive at the turnstiles between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm.

On drunken fans:
&gt;Of those who arrived at 2.30 pm or after, very many had been drinking at public houses or had brought drink from home or an off-licence. I am satisfied on the evidence, however, that the great majority were not drunk nor even the worse for drink.

On uncooperative fans:
&gt;Superintendent Marshall and other officers criticised the crowd as unco-operative because police exhortations to stop pushing and to ease back were not heeded. How could they be? In that crush most people had no control over their movements at all.

&gt;However, there were also eyewitness accounts of a horse being physically lifted off its feet by the crowd. That occurred, as the police accepted, without malice or intent but as an involuntary consequence of crowd pressure which those by the horse's flanks could not resist any more than the horse itself

On ticketless fans:
&gt;Again, however, the police witnesses who most impressed me did not consider the number of ticketless fans to be inordinately large. This accords with two other sources of evidence.

On a conspiracy among ticketless fans to get in the ground:
&gt;I have already found that there was not an abnormally large number of fans without tickets on this occasion. With one or two exceptions, the police witnesses themselves did not subscribe to the ""conspiracy"" theory. I am satisfied that the large concentration at Leppings Lane from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm did not arrive as a result of any concerted plan.

true,LyttonDays,null,null,"Hang on.  Whilst I agree more can be done, and should be done, this smacks of political ionisation.  If I understand correctly child benefit hasn't been cut except for the highest earners.  If they still get ¬£20 benefit for a first child and ¬£13.40 for each thereafter, and it's not means tested until you're earning over the average income, there's no reason as to why any child should be turning up to school either hungry or dirty outside of  bad parenting.  Fed up with porridge for breakfast?  Maybe, but hungry, no.  Councils still provide free school meals for those families on low incomes.

I'm very wary of 'Comment Is Free'.  It recognises that the Chief Executive of the charity is a former Blair-Brown advisor and media officer, and a ¬£500,000 pitch is desperately insignificant as if it is more about political statement than social resolution.  It sounds a lot like party-politik engineering a story to open up a labour talking point.

The Conservatives have made a ¬£60k cut off for Child Benefit which people have complained about.  For my money it was closer to the mark when they proposed ¬£40k, if some of the extra money saved had gone back into the poorest families, actually increasing benefit.

true,SlurpeeMoney,null,null,"I wouldn't play the Doctor. I'm Canadian, and my British accents are rubbish. But if I were in charge of designing the new Doctor, this is what I'd do with him.

I think that the current Doctor is a little wacky, a little too childlike at times, soft. At the point of his regeneration, he needs to grow up, become a respectable adult again, assume a deeper sense of responsibility. He's an adventurer, but he's also a teacher. 

My Doctor is older (mid 40's), wiser, meaner and more biting. He lectures at length, not caring if anyone listens; the lesson is important, but if you can't be arsed to listen, he'll keep talking for the other kids in the class. He's humble about what he does, but arrogant about what he *knows.* He is willing to make fun of his companions but gets grumpy when someone hits him with a zinger. 

His key costume pieces are black or white button down shirts (un-tucked), a black vest, black slacks and a single-colored scarf that he wears like a cravat. The color of the scarf would be an indicator of his mood, with the default (adventurous!) being a dark green. He would probably look something like Jeremy Northam.

His catchphrases would be ""All knowledge is worth having!"" and whatever clever bits of awesome the episode writers toss in that gains some traction with the audience. 

Where Tennant is a lot like the Fifth Doctor, and Smith is a lot like the Second, I imagine this fellow being something like the Fourth. Somber, aloof, father-like and serious with occasional moments of warmth, charm and whimsy. He is the sort of fellow you believe would tear the universe down around your shoulders to get what he wants, then offer you candy when he got it. This Doctor is less a wizard than he has been so far in the revived series; he eschews the magic wand/screwdriver in favor of good old fashioned thinking. He can't fix everything with a wave of his hand, either; there are things he can't do, and he understands that, he accepts it as part of his reality and has contingencies planned for it. He's willing to fall back when needed, and he isn't likely to hold his enemies back with bravado.

He's the sort of Doctor who needs people around to make sure he doesn't descend into total darkness. He has to surround himself with companions that cheer him up and beat back the shadows for him, because without his fake cheerfulness, he can't do it for himself anymore. He's desperate for affection and love, sometimes to the point where he steps over his own boundaries and moves past the teacher-student relationship he prefers.

* this charity is misdirecting it efforts and ought to be focused on getting children out of neglectful families or getting people access to the benefits they are entitled to

It is still very expensive to have children obviously, and there is still a good argument for further redistribution of the funds towards the poorer end of the spectrum; however I personally remain suspicious that their are children going hungry in this country due to inadequate child benefits.

It is of course ideal in a fantasy world, but this isn't some Utopia. People are greedy, people are power-hungry, people are selfish. Communism doesn't work in the real world. Just look at North Korea.

Firstly, you've got your numbers wrong (although I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that it was a typo) in that there is only 62 million - not billion - people in the United Kingdom. 

What I believe poor people should do is make sure they use their resources as well as possible. Instead of spending ¬£50 a week on cigarettes, how about using that money for food? No wonder they're starving, if they're spending all their money on drugs or alcohol. 

Yes, people are underpaid, I understand that. It's shitty and I don't like it as much as the next person. I think teachers &amp; the army should be paid more, but it's simply *not possible*. This country *has no fucking money* to pay them more. 

Maybe the system is bad, but it's better than the alternative. Poor people are poor for a reason. Whether it's they fucked up at school, got into drugs, or are simply lazy. I am not saying all poor people deserve it. As that may be one interpretation, no - I am simply saying there *must be a reason*. But why do we have benefits? To help them. Yes, they're being cut, but only for those who don't actually need them (like my parents lost their child benefit). 

&gt; Wages would rise if everyone had a job

What? No, I'm sorry, they would *fall*. Especially for things such as plumbers. Why? Because supply &amp; demand. If there is more supply (more plumbers) than demand - they drop their prices to get the customer. That is really very basic economics. Service based jobs would certainly fall. Public sector wages would probably stay roughly the same - as there is more people with those jobs, however there is also more revenue for the government through more income tax &amp; no unemployment benefits being given out. 

So really, your argument has no substance.

So? What's that got to do with anything? Most of Britain, even those on benefits are significantly richer than, I would put forward, most of the world. If not a significant proportion of it (most of africa, the Urals, China).

&gt; but almost universally people here consider themselves to be upwardly mobile and aspiring to wealth - it the exact same idiocy you see in america, 

I dispute that. The Americans have this weird ""American Dream"" thing, that they're all just temporarily indisposed millionaires. Aspiring to wealth is not the same, it is a mindset of someone trying to get upwardly socially mobile without the artificial constraint that because he is poor it is impossible (which is a mindset prevalent in the North that the Labour party does seem intent on increasing with its ""them vs. us"" attitude).

The conservative party, believe it or not, fulfills a lot of the voting goals of many people in the south east. It is not anti-socialist; it just doesn't have a ""benefits for all, regardless"" attitude which has a tendency to *lower* social mobility. My father (staunch working class northerner) believes the labour party does this deliberately because if their core voter base actually became socially mobile they'd have their own money and would then immediately vote conservative. However I feel that's a bit tinfoil-hat.

The point is, I feel the difference between the south east and other areas is the culture is not that ""I'm poor, always have been poor and always will be poor"". And because that culture is less pervasive, people can see beyond the chip on their shoulder and vote for middle-ground (OK, occasionally too right wing and reactist, but every party is far from perfect) policies.

Interesting throwaway line from the Doctor to Amy asking about her job. She replied nonchalantly that it was just a job (or something to that effect), but if the theory turns out to be true, then her job WILL become a problem in her future as we've seen in Asylum of the Daleks...

But fucking damn it, the writer of this ""article"" is more misogynistic than she claims firefly is. She has a couple of small good points, like the fact that men speak more often than women, and they are making more statements and women are asking more questions. That's an important feminist observation. A problem point in lots of media, and its worth talking about. 

But fuck, the rest of your actual misogynistic bullshit is drowning out any small amount of good points dear article writer. There is a huge issue with women being prostituted in this world. But you dare call a woman who makes the choice to be a prostitute a rape victim, and her clients rapists? Ugh I really hate sex-neg feminism. Her use of language like ""fuck toy"" and promotion of the idea that no one would possibly *choose* to be a prostitute, not to mention the idea that she is ""servicing"" the crew by being a fucking human being is ridiculously misogynistic all by itself.

true,Ezterhazy,null,null,"All quotes are from the [Interim Taylor Report](http://www.southyorks.police.uk/sites/default/files/Taylor%20Interim%20Report.pdf), which looks at the events on the day of the Hillsborough disaster. The [Final Taylor Report](http://www.epcollege.com/EPC/media/MediaLibrary/Knowledge%20Hub%20Documents/F%20Inquiry%20Reports/Hillsborough-Taylor-Report.pdf?ext=.pdf) isn't a revised report - it's a more general look at problems in football and possible solutions. Please remember that Lord Justice Taylor didn't know when he wrote the report about the fabrications in the evidence of the police.

It isn't true that the mass of fans outside the ground were late getting in:

&gt;The case made for the police was that large numbers of Liverpool supporters arrived late.

&gt;Whether those who arrived between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm were ""late"" was much debated. The ticket simply requested its holder ""to take up [his] position 15 minutes before kick-off. That may have been intended to persuade those with stand tickets to take their seats, but it would not be unreasonable for a standing spectator to arrive at the turnstiles between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm.

The Taylor report is clear that disorder amongst the fans wasn't a factor in what happened:

&gt;But the more convincing police witnesses, including especially Detective Superintendent McKay and Chief Inspector Creaser as well as a number of responsible civilian witnesses, were in my view right in
describing this element as a minority. Those witnesses attributed the crush to the sheer numbers of fans all anxious to gain entry. There was no criticism of the crowd by any of the witnesses in the period up to 2.30 pm or even 2.35 pm. What happened then was not a sudden deterioration in the mood or sobriety of those assembled there. No doubt those coming behind would have had more to drink and would have included the unruly minority. But the crisis developed because this very large crowd became packed into a confined turnstile area and its very density hampered its passage through the turnstiles.

&gt;Superintendent Marshall and other officers criticised the crowd as unco-operative because police exhortations to stop pushing and to ease back were not heeded. How could they be? In that crush most people had no control over their movements at all.

Regarding the bit I wrote about the police opening the gates to make it easier for themselves and that fans were directed into the already-full pens. A better representation is that the police officer in command of policing, CS Duckenfield, received three separate reports from one of his Superintendents, with other senior officers in agreement, advising of the possibility of fatalities if a gate was not opened. Duckenfield only allowed the gate to be opened five minutes after first being advised about the likelihood of fatalities but crucially didn't advise either the control room or the officers inside the ground about this decision.

&gt;Superintendent Marshall realised the crowd had become unmanageable. Although loth to do so, since it was contrary to basic police strategy, he decided to request the exit gates be opened to relieve the pressure. Otherwise, he feared fatalities would occur. Other senior officers outside the ground agreed. At 2.47 pm he radioed control to permit the gates to be opened. At 2.48 pm, whilst Mr Duckenfield was considering the request, gate C opened to eject a youth who had climbed in with no ticket. Immediately, fans outside took advantage and about 150 managed to get in before a mounted officer enabled the gate to be closed again. Mr Marshall repeated his request. Still no response from control. He repeated it a third time, adding that if the 11gates were not opened someone was going to be killed. In the control room, Mr Duckenfield had not made a decision. Mr Murray asked him ""Are you going to open the gates?"". Mr Duckenfield gave the order and Sgt Goddard radioed to Mr Marshall ""Open the gates"". Neither the Club control room nor any police officers inside the turnstiles were told of this order before or after it was given or of any action it would require.

So it was specifically Duckenfield who made life easier for himself. He ignored advice from senior officers on the ground at first, then when did did decide to open the gates he didn't give any follow-up advice to his colleagues in the ground.

&gt;When Mr Marshall's request came, Mr Duckenfield's capacity to take decisions and give orders seemed to collapse. Having sanctioned, at last, the opening of the gates, he failed to give necessary consequential orders or to exert any control when the disaster occurred. He misinterpreted the emergence of fans from pens 3 and 4. When he was unsure of the problem, he sent others down to ""assess the situation"" rather than descend to see for himself. He gave no information to the crowd.

Regarding the fans being directed into the full pens: in Appendix 4 of the Interim Taylor Report you can see quite clearly how Gate C leads directly to the two pens where the fatalities occurred. By directing fans through gate C, they were being sent directly to those pens. The tunnel should have been closed but it wasn't, because of the failings in the decisions made by senior police officers.

&gt;Since pens 3 and 4 were full by 2.50 pm, the tunnel should have been closed off whether gate C was to be opened or not. The exercise was a simple one and had been carried out in 1988. All that was necessary was for a few officers to act as a cordon at the entrance to the tunnel and divert fans elsewhere. Unfortunately, the 1988 closure seems to have been unknown to the senior officers on duty at the time. It did not figure in the debriefing notes. It therefore had no influence on the planning for 1989.

&gt;Planning apart, however, it should have been clear in the control room where there was a view of the pens and of the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be closed. If orders had been given to that effect when gate C was opened, the fans could have been directed to the empty areas of the wings and this disaster could still have been avoided. Failure to give that order was a blunder of the first magnitude.",0,1347207498,null,0,false,0,c65pe43,t3_zli8n,t1_c65pe43,t1_c65oikb,null,1429856176,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; They're going to criminalise whistling too?

I think if you read the article carefully, as well as approach the notion of the legislation with a slightly more open mind, you might understand that no, whistling won't be criminalised. ""Wolf whistling"" perhaps, though the article says this, specifically: ""the clause on sexual harassment was not intended to cover less serious incidents such as wolf-whistling and public teasing"". You might say that the difference between whistling and wolf whistling is semantics, but if you can't understand the difference then that's indicative of a lack of understanding of where this law is coming from, I think.

If you'll excuse some musing on my part, I'm going to guess that you're male? Let me be clear that I'm not dismissing your opinions just because of that (hell, I'm a man too) or at all (I understand where you're coming from, even if I don't agree) but I have to wonder just how many people who might get annoyed, worried or shirty about legislation like this are female. Not many, I warrant (I could do a survey but I think it's a fair assumption), and I think that if that is the case then it's rather telling.

By the by - What tweets have been criminalised and why does it matter that they're tweets? If you're referring to Paul Chambers: That conviction was finally overturned and rightly so. If you're referring to the young man who had a go at Tom Daley, I believe that the reason the police got involved was because he threatened to drown Daley in the pool rather than because he was rude about Daley's dad (the papers seemed to forget about the death threat for some reason, failed to mention it from what I saw). If you mean the several convictions I know of for racist remarks (mainly by or to footballers and the like?), well I imagine we could have a discussion on that (""What counts as racist?"" maybe) but again I'll ask why should it matter that they're tweets? Would it be different if I said it to someone's face or if I wrote a letter?

true,CVI07,null,null,"First, she's a prop.  She's literally a device the Silence created, apparently to kill the doctor in the most roundabout, convoluted, poorly planned way possible, which is a plot disguise for her being a device Moffat used to tie the season's story arc together.  ""Who is River Song?"" Who *cares*? They devoted two entire seasons to the character's story and the whole thing was a mess.  It cheapened the Ponds, it cheapened the Doctor, and most of all it cheapened River herself.

Even discounting the Silence stuff, every time she shows up she's a third wheel; River is never *necessary* to the plot.  She always waltzes in with a big dramatic musical chord like we're not expecting her, even though she shows up all the damn time. Even when she ""saves the day"", another character could have just as easily done so without this gunslingy obnoxious cougar running around spouting catch-phrases and making faces.  She's got that Jack Harkness recurring companion role, except where Captain Jack was somewhat charming, River is just a cartoon.

It might be partially  casting thing.  While I think Kingston is a serviceable actress, they've got her throwing her 50-year-old self at a guy who looks 30 years younger than she is. I know he's actually much older, she's actually much younger, but the result is just sad and awkward, and the two have zero chemistry.

River's first couple appearances were fine.  Once we got into the Silence era, it just went downhill.  By the end of last season, she was a cartoon.

You have made the assumption that inadequate parenting = ""poor people"". I did not, and do not. I have seen plenty of inadequate affluent parents.

Also your characterisation of the problems of the child (""druggie"", ""psychopath"") as the 'fault of the parent' is also wrong and a misrepresentation of what I'm talking about. I disagree with that. The point was clearly about parents' problems affecting their ability to look after their children.

I do not propose or support your solutions, which are obviously meant to be over the top and nasty. All I'm saying is that pretending a problem doesn't exist is not a solution in itself.

I really don't know how else to say this, but when he gets into a goal scoring position I think he really just needs to kick the ball. Avoid kicking straight at the keeper, sure, but besides that no precise aiming, no over thinking, just kick it.

1. Entertainment and art are meant to make you feel emotions.  They do this through a series of events that establish the emotions they want the viewer to feel.  When you leap back and forth, it is very hard to keep both emotions working.
1.   And this is a personal preference mostly, but the middle seemed to retreat cause a retreat from a modern moral dilemma: animal rights.  The camp setting was set up to be used as a way of exploring the animal rights issue without including bias or pointing fingers, because the bad guy was a space-rapist.  It would allow a more direct way of addressing animal rights, and the best way to involve your audience is to get them to think.
1. It just ruins the feel of the episode.  If you spliced 45 minutes of ""Shaun of The Dead"" into the middle of an episode of the walking dead, it wouldn't help either of them.  The cheesy, humorous feeling would be lost when someone is dragged to their death, but the drama would be watered down by the silliness and camp.

2) Depends if you're more interested in set theory or how steel works. I was a CompSci and Larry Paulson's ML lectures were a highlight of the first year. That said, I have NatSci friends who came intending to do Physics and enjoyed Materials so much they ended up focussing on that instead. I'd personally recommend CompSci, as skills are transferrable later on when you'll have coding projects for NatSci, and also it's just very interesting. But it really depends on what you're more interested in.

Whilst I'm in the fortunate position that I've never had to claim benefits and I don't have any children, I'm aware that other people can and do have a really difficult time making ends meet.

Of course, what the majority of commenters, sitting at their nice PCs and laptops, are failing to take into account is that, sometimes, unforeseen circumstances occur and once a family is hit financially it can take them literally months or years to recover from it.

A friend of mine who is unemployed recently received a poorly worded letter from the job centre to attend an appointment - the letter said ""Arrive 10.00 - 10.30.""  She got there at ten past ten and was informed that she was late so they were going to mark her down as a non-attendee.  Her benefit was then stopped and she was informed that she wasn't eligible for an emergency payment.  Basically, she has had zero money for about three weeks now.  Fortunately, I was able to take her round a bag of groceries from my own cupboard so that she didn't starve.

I can't comment on the Physics options, but as far as your social life is concerned you can do pretty much anything in Cambridge. There is a society for everything, sports of many kinds, language groups, activism societies, hobby societies, subject societies, there is no lack of organised people with strong passions in Cambridge. Look out for the Freshers' Fair at the start of the year, most societies try to have a stand there to give out leaflets and recruit young, willing Freshers (first years).

Otherwise, there's more than one nightclub, although there certainly is one that is more popular than all the others (Cindies), it tends to be rather common-denominator music, if you have particular musical interests other clubs may be more suited. Fez for instance has a big electronica and Drum'n'Bass scene. The other clubs are by far not barren though, as some nights are reduced in price for students, the tickets for which will be handed out to your College entertainment officers.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The thing is, ""The Eleventh Hour"" has so many things in it that I would liken it to Homestuck.  There is justification for almost everything.  That's Moffat's style that he parodied in ""Asylum of the Daleks"".  That episode is effectively a primer for the Moffat style.  Old villain or campy concept made scary (zombie insane Daleks) and little details can matter ""Who cares about milk!?  How can that be important??  Oh, now I see.""

Going into full nitpick mode just to make a point.  There is evidence for almost anything in that episode if you want it.

* Staring us straight in the face, to paraphrase Dorium, is this tidbit.  Something is seriously off about Amelia as early as this episode.  ""Don't have a mom and dad, just an aunt.""  This is the ""Why is milk important?"" bit, we learn later what happened to her parents.  Solution found!  She knows she should have parents, but they got erased.  Therefore she rationalizes why she doesn't have any.

Only later, in the next scene ""I used to hate apples.  So my mom put faces on them.""  Innocent, seems to pay off in allowing the doctor to earn Amy's trust in the future.  Only... her parents were erased.  How does she remember this?  

She's not a time traveler yet, and even if she was this would be crossing her own time stream.  Fourteen years of living next to the crack, becoming a time traveler, and the doctor trying to help her remember and she couldn't remember Rory soon after it happened.  Yet she lives with her aunt and can remember her parents.  Basically, she did something that should only be possible if she were a time traveler and these weren't her real parents.  Oversight or something else?  Hard to say.

* Related to above, but a different point.  To paraphrase Asylum of the Daleks, ""You can see me, but why can't I ever see you?""  I can't find the quote.  Maybe I'm misremembering it.  I remember back in series 5 Moffat or somebody stating the arc villain was in The Eleventh Hour, we just didn't see them.  Series 6, oh, the Silence.  That's why.  Wait, why would the Silence already be in Amelia's home?  Who ""raised"" Amelia?  Her parents are gone, so her aunt.  We never see her.  We never get a name.  Has it ever been stated how River/Melody got to Amelia's home town, the same age as Amelia, and even knew where to go?  The Doctor himself in the Eleventh Hour state's Amelia Pond sounds like out of a fairy tale, a fake name.  Like the ""friend"" who came out of no where to be River, where is the aunt that didn't even get a token name drop at the Wedding?  Could the aunt be Madame Kovarian who is already there active due to Melody?  After all, there is an Aunt, who else rebuilt the shed the Doctor crashed into?

* I state the Silence were already active as two more tiny things during the Amelia part of the episode stand out.  First, in hindsight the music shift and camera movement stresses the hallway where Amy forgets that one door Prisoner 0 will/is hiding in.  The door is open.  Prisoner 0 never demonstrates the memory altering ability, only a perception filter that hides things.  

Second, mentioned elsewhere is the stairway in Amy/Amerlia's house.  From the outside, two full floors.  Inside, a stairway to the third floor.  A stairway similar to what I have in my house.  That isn't just a stairway you build to go to some attic.  Depending on the house's shape, there could be a decent sized third floor up there.  But, but why I say, has the series gone near out of its way to only shoot that house to make it look like there shouldn't be room for a third floor, not attic?  What is the most standalone episode of that series.  The Lodger.  It introduces the Silence's time machine.   It also introduces the concept of the Silence creating phantom extra floors.  

Might be a coincidence.  They just didn't want to show the house from those angles for another reason or something.

* Rory's ID tag.  At this point even if it was an accident I wouldn't be surprised if Moffat worked it into his plan due to how much attention it has received.  Still strange they gave the ID such a moment of attention if there was never a pay-off for it, even if the data was wrong.

* Rory in general.  Just happens pick up on the antagonist's disguise?  His first words describing the Doctor, ""OMG, it's him.  He's a story, a game...""  ""There was a trickster, a goblin...""  ""He is not a goblin or a phantom or a trickster..."" Different words, but the first time that sentiment is stated in the Moffat era.  He just happens to end up in a trio of friends who includes a home-brewed-Time-Lord that is his own daughter a girl who is altered by time cracks?  Dies so many times that even the Silence were compelled to mention this feat.  Older than the Doctor now, and complains of a knocking similar to the Master (maybe, could have just been Hitler).  Picks up on things such as the Tardis without even flinching?

Whose to say that Rory isn't a plant (what faction, unknown), and that the Silence weren't already messing with Amelia to create the perfect mother for their home-brewed-Time-Lord?

* Even a more mundane example, ""Aren't you going to turn your back?"".  Rory lists several complaints about the Doctor's actions.  Summoning deadly aliens back to earth.  Stealing from innocents (just clothes).  Finally he turns his back on the Doctor, asking Amy to do the same.  Amy, stays with the doctor.  A scene carried out again and again.  Rory, for whatever reason, goes along with the Doctor, follows, aids, but is there disagreeing.  Amy is always in the heat of the mix.

My actual point behind this is that I have discovered in my time here, that a lot of the people trapped in the poverty/unemployment net here all have one thing in common; a poor education. Most of the parents on this estate were raised here themselves, and most of them disregarded their education, yet nearly all them smoke and drink, some quite heavily.

Personally I believe that it is the meanings behind words that are offensive, not the words themselves. It is just a sound, or just some shapes on the screen, there is nothing intrinsically bad about it. 

The thing that is 'bad' about someone saying 'nigger' is that it might be indicative of some nasty hatreds and prejudices they might harbour. The word itself is not the problem, it's the emotion that might be behind it that is the problem. In a sentence in which there is no hatred or bile the word ceases to be offensive. For example, you used the word 'nigger' in *your* post, but you weren't being offensive or nasty, so it'd be strange to be offended by your use of it there.

And this is not a pre-school, or an after dinner speech at the Henley Regatta, we are all big boys, I don't think there needs to be any words that are out-of-bounds.

true,myimportantthoughts,cnty-uk,It's grim up North London,"I am English and I would support separation. I feel that (contrary to popular belief) the English get a raw deal at the moment. Why should English people pay for Scots to have free prescriptions, cheaper uni and more per capita in transfer payments? They are not making nearly enough money or taking in enough in taxes for this. Also, let us not forget that HBOS and RBS needed billions in bailouts. I know people might bring up North Sea oil, but this is sometimes overrated. Yes, oil/gas deposits are good, but they are not long term assets. London will still have a financial sector in the future, North Sea oil is running out. This is not a question of subjective politics, but simple economics (which I am studying at significant outlay). Scotland is like England's cash hungry partner that demands (and receives) luxuries England cannot afford for itself. 


If Scotland do stay in the UK, there needs to be parity, with tax rates/prescriptions/uni fees equal between different nations. A transfer of wealth between England and Scotland is not something many English would be prepared to sign up for.

Check out this link about Scotland:
http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/jeremywarner/100010146/scotland-would-be-as-bust-as-iceland-if-it-had-been-independent/ 

Independence is primarily an issue for Scots. Even if I did wish for them to remain part of the UK (which I don't, at least not on current terms) I really don't think it my duty to force reluctant people to be part of my country. This is a bad idea on so many levels, which history has shown us. If Scotland wants to leave I would simply say goodbye and good luck.

You also ask if Scotland is capable of being relevant while independent. This is a question for someone wiser than I, but I will give it a bash. In terms of economic power and international power, Scotland would not be a significant country. Their small size, economic insignificance (particularly with a relatively unknown currency that they would have to print) and lack of military power would mean that they had little power in the EU, UN, NATO etc. The UK would lose some power, but the financial dominance of London and the international relationships with other countries would not change much I think. But what do I now eh?

First is dependent on them actually voting for independence. If they vote for it, I'm for it. If they vote against it, I'm against it. No rational person could have it any other way in my opinion. It should be the Scots that ultimately decide it, not a campaign from Westminster, nor anyone from anywhere but Scotland. 

Secondly that it'd be a massive shake up in UK politics. It might actually be something that fosters political change for once. It'd bring a harsh reality to a lot of English voters and we'd have a big realisation that our current political system doesn't do a very good job of actually representing us at all. Realisation, leads to mobilisation, leads to change. 

Finally that I think it'd finally destroy the arguments of the old nationalists who think we still have an Empire and that we should distance ourselves from Europe.

Maybe doing that meant that I've locked myself out of that opportunity by asking...but I always believe people who get it shoved upon them may not care as much as those who want to do it. And either way...there are other people out there that could do it too.

They used to have maybe a few or so more mods than they do now, actually. I've also sent a fair few mails (on other topics) to them and I don't actually recall ever getting a reply on one of them. I recall when HazzW was on the team and I got a reply from him very quickly. I mean...I feel a little ignored as they DO get notifications of mail, unlike reports.

And being a mod on two other subreddits (albeit, neither are anywhere near as popular), I know how quick and easy it is to keep a track of these things. Maybe takes only up to around 10 seconds to **properly** check if a post is appropriate, if that. So I'm 110% sure with a few more mods looking through them properly and often, it should be dead easy to keep up.

Just feel a little disappointed. :(",0,1347218575,null,0,1347220475,0,c65s1q9,t3_zloby,t1_c65s1q9,t1_c65reod,null,1429857495,14,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,14

Calling someone a retard as an off-handed comment is completely different to going up to someone who is actually mentally-handicapped and using it in their face. With the former usage, there's not really any damage done to anyone.

Did you know that 'idiot' used to be used on census forms for people with severe mental retardation? 'Imbecile' and 'Moron' were used in a similar context with regard to mental age. Do people complain about these?

If you think about it, those words are still as offensive by your measure as 'retard'. I bet you use them yourself from time to time.

If you want to go down the route of complaining about the use of one word, you should think a bit more about all of the other words you use. It might slow you down a bit, but hey, you probably find it better than having an argument that is reduced to week old 'catshit' by a mere word.

The last figures I saw (wikipedia, I believe) said Scotland paid 9.4% of tax and received 9.2%.  Do you have any data that contradicts this?

Scotland's deficits are a little awkward because they do, in fact, depend a lot on North Sea oil.  Last year, without oil, they ran a deficit of ¬£14.3B, with a per capita share: ¬£13.4B, but only ¬£4.4B with a geographical cut.  Otherwise the deficit isn't usually too bad and changes a fair amount year on year.

I think that HBOS and RBS are an awkward subject (again) because they're subject to UK law and went bust in part because of what deregulation (in the UK) allowed them to do and what regulatory authorities (in the UK) didn't do.  Then again Salmond seemed pleased with RBS.  It's about as awkward a subject as should Scotland own 1/10th of all embassies and other public buildings?

Regarding Scotland's relevance on the international stage: Cyprus and Malta get more of a say in the EU than Scotland.  Not everything that benefits the UK as a whole benefits Scotland in particular.  Also if Scotland used it's own currency, it could weaken it to boost manufacturing and improve employment and food/drink export  - a strong currency - which favours the UK, works against Scotland in this case.",0,1347220620,null,0,1347220833,0,c65sk3b,t3_zlrht,t1_c65sk3b,t1_c65rlyg,null,1429857736,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

true,pbhj,uk,.,"It's quite a bit more pro-rata than our family earn gross - we have to run a car for work and a good chunk goes on the mortgage. We do get some income support but also still have to pay taxes. Factoring in housing costs I suspect we're on even less still than this family; that money would stretch a lot further if we weren't working too. We don't qualify for discount/free school meals so there must be others on a lot less(?).

Without nicotine, alcohol and sky TV we seem to find enough to interest us though it is hard work.

I'd like to see some accountability here. Not just for having so many kids but for the spending of the tax-payers pounds too: they all have mobile phones, he goes out to the pub every week and buys lager for home, she smokes 200 ciggys a week??? That's not good use of benefit money IMO especially as they're not, it seems, buying a healthy diet for the kids.

Personally I'd cut benefits and give targeted help like paid access to veggie box schemes and basic instruction in domestic skills. Perhaps a scheme for repaired domestic appliances.

Living on benefits I imagine I'd need to 'work' to have clothes and food - get an allotment, patch clothing [check], cook everything from scratch [check], and then make sure I was doing something to pay back society like charity work [check].

Osbourne's sketch was about how he re-mortgaged his home in his constituency after paying off his actual second home in London, then claimed it was his second home, so the tax-payer had to pay the interest on what he claimed was his second home, but was actually his re-mortgaged first home (meaning he basically got free money at the expense of the tax-pot). In the show they went and put up one of those blue plaques.

They also do a sketch where they stand outside Lloyds and ask bankers to donate to a charity, when asked which charity they say GUBOFMYC... Give Us Back Our Fucking Money You Cunts. Or said ""it's for an orphanage that's being closed down because we had to bail out you twats"".

http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-who-loses-if-scotland-goes-it-alone/6524

This is a debatable figure, as it fails to include both Oil revenues which are about 12Bn and the earlier bailout (and possible future bailouts) of HBOS and RBS. 

A key issue would be the oil price, Scotland might become a state that is extremely dependent on oil/gas revenues. This could arguably lead to a boom for Scotland as they export oil at $70, $100 or even $200+ well into future and become a wealthy nation with a sovereign wealth fund that buys up investments abroad (like UAE). This could be brilliant for Scotland as oil runs out.

However, they could encounter 'resource curse' which has blighted many countries, leading them rich in resources which other countries profit from like Seirra Leone. There is also the possibility that the oil price could fall (hear me out) should renewables take off in the future. If bio-fuels or some new efficient wind turbine/solar panel type thing takes off (not impossible in the next 50 years) then the oil price could fall dramatically. Even some kind of Arab-Israeli peace deal could put oil down 10-20%, having a huge knock on the global economy.

true,ekhornbeck,null,null,"&gt;The SNP is against nuclear weapons on Scottish soil. Any negotiation to join NATO will be on the basis that Scotland intends to be nuclear weapon free.

That may be the lofty intention but, like so much SNP policy, it doesn't bear scrutiny in reality.  Even their own anti-nuclear activists are concerned, and there seems to be internal division on this issue:

http://news.stv.tv/politics/187235-snp-nuclear-activists-to-call-for-scotland-to-be-kept-out-of-nato/

http://www.heraldscotland.com/mobile/politics/political-news/snp-and-nato-battle-stations.18693017?_=02c8be94d9fa60afd0e8fab82a7f004105a90bee

&gt;That has nothing to do with the SNP government. Defence is an issue reserved to Westminster.

However, one would think that Salmond's passionate anti-nuclear stance would have led him to comment on this example of Scotland's being unwillingly used as a dock for nuclear submarines.  Yet he remained curiously silent.  

&gt;You don't know much about the Scottish media.

I know of one recent example of a major Scottish newspaper turning down a story of an important Scottish historical find because 'it wasn't about independence'.

true,darknecross,null,null,"Posts that get voted up aren't necessarily *good* content, though. They get voted up because they're easily digestible and the turnaround time between consumption and voting is quick. 

The way reddit's ""what's hot"" algorithm works is that it picks up on new posts that receive a large amount of votes in a short time period. So while one quality post/article that takes 5 minutes to read might get posted at the same time as a meme or a random screenshot of an episode, the second one will almost always make the front page in lieu of the first because it takes a second to look at and gets voted up. So even if you have the same 50 people browsing /new, that first post might get 20 votes over the course of half an hour (and that's stretching it) while the first can receive the same amount in minutes.

I could go off on more of a tangent talking about how the frontpage creates a predisposition for low-effort content when mixed with all of the other subreddits, but I don't get into that now. The main takeaway is that votes do nothing to filter the type of content that makes the top of a subreddit because it's a flawed system that caters to the cheap, low-effort content a lot of subs have instated rules to combat against.

Until you have an actual understanding of mental illness and how extremely personal and debilitating it can be for a person, then I would kindly suggest you refrain from speaking on a subject you know nothing about - especially when casually tossing around words like ""scumbag"".

Clinical anxiety and/or panic disorders are not some crutch that you just need to ""get over"". They can be so extreme that a person has literally no control over their body, their breathing, even their own thoughts. A person in this situation feels bad enough about missing out on important life moments, even though they have no control over this. They don't need further shaming from someone who has apparently left their compassion and empathy behind in favor of uninformed judgement.

2) I don't do Physics, but I will of course say Computer Science is a way better option simply because I am a computer scientist :P At my college, out of the iirc 4 Physicists who took CompSci, all but one dropped out of it in the first 2 weeks. So it may not be for the faint of hearted, but having a solid Computer Science foundation will probably be a help in almost any are of science, as you are going to have to use computers a lot, and for far more complicated things than just writing documents (as I'm sure you already knew :P). Case in point, the one that did stick it out has just been doing some fancy astrophysics type internship thing this summer, largely because not only does he know some physics but also really knows his way around a computer, so he certainly seems to have enjoyed it a lot and found it useful. Obviously, I am *extremely* biased here, so take that all with a pinch of salt. I would say that although you absolutely do not need to know any programming beforehand for CompSci, it may be worth trying out a bit of programming to see if you enjoy it.

3) I think other people have already covered the clubs fine, I'm not much of a clubbing person so I won't attempt to list them all. My personal preference is for the metal night at the Fountain, which isn't really a club, but hey.

As for social in general, you can easily meet up with people whenever you like, I imagine this is the same as any other uni, but even I (fairly introverted) can always find people to hang out with among my friends, so I wouldn't worry that you'll be lacking a social life. There's all sorts of societies for social activites. My personal favourites are the Mixtape society and the Gaming society, but to each their own :P

true,BatmansBFF,jack,Jack Harkness,"While I disagree, I'm also upset to see that you were down-voted, seeing as you DID provide good reasoning as to why you dislike her.  I don't exactly agree with everything you said, but I think that the many people who watch Doctor Who see actions and personalities in different ways.  For example, I personally disliked Martha's character, however there are many others that DID like her.  We all perceive actions in different ways and I can respect that you had your reasons about the way you felt.
To me, her role was rather important, and perhaps even more important than we currently know since we haven't really even gotten to the conclusion of her story yet.  In Silence at the Library, I had fully intended to dislike River; mainly out of anxiety that the Doctor would grow to be a completely different person and she had a part in that.  However, the more I saw her, the more I grew to be compassionate towards her because of what she had been through.  I could never imagine being in reverse with every person I loved.  That would be unimaginably horrible.  While she has her annoying moments, I love how strong she can be and how she overcame her miserable beginning.  I also grew to love Amy so much through River; I saw a completely different side to her through River.

Doesn't mean that applies to the internet. You have no right to tell a stranger on here what words they can or cannot use, nor to decide that their opinions are worth naught because you don't like the way they speak. 

I've never personally heard the word used against someone with an actual handicap and I hear it in public all the time. I hear plenty of things in public however, so maybe I'm just disillusioned.

I don't think it's entitlement, since at the end of the day it's just language. I think it's unwarranted entitlement to feel that you have the right not to be offended.

true,MrJMaxted0291,uk,United Kingdom,"I personally support a preserved union. We share national resources and services and we have no real discernible way to address who would receive what. The national assets of the UK aren't a cake you can just neatly cut in half and share out between parting states.

The nuclear issue is the clearest example of this. Salmond is saying he wants them out of Scotland in the event of a split, but the reality of the situation is that there aren't any suitable locations to house these weapons in England, and moving them south of the border would be a prickly issue in the first place. What Is the Scottish government going to do with those weapons when it turns out we have no where to store them? This important chunk of the military of Britain exists in Scotland and cannot easily exist anywhere else in the UK. You can't sell these Nukes and you can't dismantle them without permission from our parliament.

As for the issue with the Tories though, it's fair to say that a lot of us didn't vote Conservative either. The thing that ensures a constant merry go round of Lab/Con is the first past the post system, which is exploited to gerrymander voter results and preserve the current status quo that exists. In the last general election the Lib Dems had 23% of the popular vote compared to Labour's 29%. However, in seats this only translated to 57 seats for the Lib Dems, compared to over 300 for Labour.

Reddit already has a system set up to deal with content. and I think it works just fine.

If supposed crap is getting upvoted then the majority of people like it.

It's just a butt-hurt minority trying to impose their views on the rest of of us.

Alot of the people who are bitching here have said they completely left the sub-reddit! well good! and don't let the door hit your ass on the way out!

People forget the democratic nature of this site. If you don't like something then go find a sub-reddit you do like.

true,2960G,null,null,"I'm a Brit (read: English) living in Scotland. I'd just like to chip in to highlight one thing about the debate that I've always found disturbing, and unfortunately has reared it's head in a number of comments already.

And that is: the rest of the UK's largely naive and ill-informed attitude to Scotland, and the Scottish people's reluctance to actually correct them.

I've lived in Glasgow for a few years now, which when I tell people from outside Scotland incites one of two responses: 1) if they've not been there, it's a ""oooh, Glasgow, that's a rough isn't it?"", or 2) if they have been there, ""Glasgow! it surprisingly good no?!"". However a Glaswegian would rarely correct anyone in the first instance - and instead enjoy to promote this stereotyped image.

(Kevin Bridges talks about this too: http://youtu.be/RJY2LXsDGe0)

I've found this attitude can broadly be applied to the rest of Scotland too. It's almost like there's a ""don't let on how good the place is, as otherwise everyone will want to come"". This leads to a false representation of Scotland to anyone outside the country. A representation which bills the country as an insignificant, poor, unskilled drain on it's neighbour -- something my first hand experiences of living and working in the country contradicts.

It means people dismiss the country, and dismiss the independence issue, resulting in views like ""not much to base an economy on other than tourism and the Edinburgh Woollen Mill"", and a general ""Scotland, waste of time, they can just piss off"" view.

I would quite honestly say that Scotland has far more to offer than many realize. You can use this to support unity, or independence - but either way I still find that so much of the public debate on the issue fails to fully appreciate this.",0,1347230466,null,0,1347257664,0,c65uwvk,t3_zlrht,t1_c65uwvk,t3_zlrht,null,1429858845,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

true,SuperSonic4,eu,Burrrmin'am,"It's basically a smokescreen to deflect unwanted attention from the fact that the Coalition is doing very little to close tax loopholes, force those at the top to pay their share of tax and to even the distribution of income. 

Additionally, it was used as a headline grabber, for example how many people knew that ESA(C) is now only payable for twelve months if you're in the Work Related Activity Group?
[Link](http://www.dwp.gov.uk/adviser/updates/changes-to-contribution/)

I'd guess that families on benefits receiving more than ¬£500pw on benefits are rare, that an overwhelming majority of claims are legitimate and that relative (fuel) poverty is on the increase. But then that doesn't make an attractive headline nor does it fit in with government and media policy to tar everyone with the same brush to make benefit cuts more popular. 
The amounts of benefits one gets is similar to those in work, very few get a lot of money whilst the majority get very little - put that in your pipe and smoke it!


nb: Most so-called benefits are actually allowances with the connotation that you are not entitled to this money but rather it is given to you out of the goodness of someone's heart.

I know this article is months old but the Coalition have been doing this from the second they got ""elected"".

**tl;dr : this is an outlier of a case and allowance monies are a drop in the ocean compared to what is lost in unpaid tax and the ¬£26k is basically the velvet glove on the iron fist of benefit cuts**




edit - to make things clear about the ESA stealth:

&gt;25. We expect around 120,000 people will immediately lose entitlement to
&gt;ESA (C). We estimate around 60% of these will have some entitlement to ESA (IR).

[PDF link](http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/esa-changes.pdf)

In other words whilst everyone was arguing about whether ¬£26k was too high the government have stealthily kicked a least estimate^1 of 48,000 people off paid ESA and, due to the nature of the legislation, these people have passed ATOS's piss-poor excuse for a medical. 

^1 Using the figures in the PDF - 40% of 120,000 is 48,000. The figure will likely be higher because this assumes that the 60% who have some entitlement are getting the full whack which won't be the case.",0,1347230655,null,0,1347231354,0,c65uyf1,t3_zloxv,t1_c65uyf1,t3_zloxv,null,1429858865,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

1. He never uses terms like that to begin with, calling Amy and Rory by their names and not ""mum"" and ""dad"". So he wouldn't use the term ""grandpa"".

2. He didn't want to overwhelm Brian. It was bad enough the poor man has anxiety, but he had to face the fact he was on a spaceship far from home.

Your example of the Bank of England is not a good one as there are dozens of countries that use someone else's currency. Not that it matters, Scotland is a stakeholder in the Bank of England and would have proportional say come independence. Which is a tonne more than we have at the moment. 

&gt;  The SNP have quietly changed their mind on a 'nuclear-free Scotland', deciding to retain Nato membership if Scotland becomes independent.

Not quite, AFAIK they said it would not be an immediate withdrawal of the base, with some sort of rent system being in place. This was to put the UK military at ease, it will take some time to commission a new site and there will be a lot of political fallout from the NIBMYs who don't want it near them. Hell, I live 30 miles downwind of the place, it's good to know that Scotland's largest city will be amoung the first to die in WW3. It's shit like that that makes us want independence!

In short, they don't want to make a political foe of the UK military leadership and have them going full throttle on the ""better together"" campaign out of fear of temporarily losing the UK's nuclear deterrent. 

&gt; All the while allowing nuclear subs to dock,

Does the Scottish Parliament even have jurisdiction over which foreign nations subs dock at Faslane? I think you are really reaching here. Faslane is operated by the Royal Navy and any logistical negotiations with France would have gone through Whitehall.

1. The red and blue bow tie are 2 different doctors in 2 parallel timelines created by The Big Bang.

The other one wearing a red tie has Silariouns (an intelligent species during the time of dinosaurs, could be a possible alternate earth timeline) and the weeping angels (although introduced with 10, their purpose as a villain is still unknown.) 


2. It's the way Amy is remembering The Doctor. Throughout the past 3 seasons The Doctor has frequently told amy to ""remember"" and as most recently in The Asylum of The Daleks ""Make them remember who you are."" Surely this has more significance than making The Daleks remember The Amy Pond we the viewer know.

Proportional share of all current assets based on population ratios. Future assets are down to the regions concerned, we have no more claim on English cider taxation than England would have on Scottish oil. This is well established stuff.

That's your problem, the Scottish government would have no say in the matter.

In general I am comfortable with who I am and there are a lot of things that I feel that I am ""confident"" about. I am often told that I am funny and witty. I can engage with people on virtually any non sport related topic. I work in a public service job and have been told that I have a friendly and patient manner with those that I deal with. However, I am also not quick to initiate social interactions. I enjoy spending time with people I like, but I often enjoy solitude. Not a loner, but certainly not an extrovert.

So, is this simply a matter of needing to be more extroverted and outgoing? That is not really on the table for me. I have no wish to be that guy.

I think the phenomenon you're describing is definitely real though.

I think that definitely makes it harder to see him as being the same person. Combine that with the fact that we got a new Doctor and a new companion in the same episode and it's easy to see how people would have a hard time adjusting. Granted, 2 whole seasons ought to be enough time, but I can see the problem.

Unemployment costs, there is an issue with the social problems caused by people not working. It makes people reliant on the state, which is always a bad thing. If we put the issues of people not being able to find work aside for the moment and just focus on the highly visible and disruptive people who fucked around in school, have no education, skills or work ethic and are fine with doing the bare minimum to get welfare - it might be cheaper to just pay them, but it does no good for society if you do this. You actually need to fix the problems, and this does cost money.

ATOS is a boondoggle though. I do think that people getting welfare should be given assessments from time to time, especially with conditions that change over time. But the system that ATOS uses is bullshit. And this is also a case where spending more, to give people who are disable the help they need to live normal lives, is better for society.

As you are talking to me, I get to know you better and I realize you are not like those that ""fall in love"" wit""oohh! first woman that showed interest me! I love her!"" kind of guys that have issues with themselves and may be someone that won't rely on a woman for self-assurance.

Way to go &lt;3

By the way, you are kind of right about confidence not being identical to charisma. It's just that often it takes confidence to be who you are and not bend to peer pressure. There are insecure guys that are charismatic even if they don't know it simply by the fact that they have certain strong personality attributes that we admire (i.e. being a very nice person, no matter what bullying they get).",0,1347237678,null,0,false,0,c65wl6o,t3_zk7ug,t1_c65wl6o,t1_c65vlai,null,1429859667,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

For instance, using the last episode as an example, RTD would most likely have The Doctor give a decent sized monologe of why he was choosing not to spare the life of Solomon. I thought it was perfectly handled with the one sentence 'Did the Silurians beg you to stop?' it so much more perfectly captured how he felt about the situation, and his anger towards the man's genocide.

Next is just that the vast majority of subreddits have pretty meaningless crap there.

Remember how Ecclestone reacted to seeing the single Dalek, when he thought he'd killed them all. He was incredibly hostile. 

The whole Angels double bill annoyed me for the same reasons. The whole point of them being ""Weeping Angels"" is because they're hiding their eyes because *they can't look at each other!* 

This was supposedly because the were ""quantum locked"" and therefore couldn't move if they were observed. 

Then Moffat completely rewrites them. Implies that it's a natural *instinctive* defence mechanism, which completely changes what the Angels are. 

I was very disappointed with that. Regardless I thought the episodes were good. 

Back on topic, it is worth watching because it's Who. There are some great episodes and season six is quite epic with the whole Silence story arc.

An example being that in the first Dalek episodes, one of the companions actually climbs into a Dalek and controls it for a short amount of time.
It's very different, but it definitely is something that I think should be experienced. The main problem is that it's very difficult to watch multiple episodes in one sitting, they are meant to be spaced out kinda like it was on tv.

true,brilliance,tardis,TARDIS,"So I'm not all that far ahead of you in the grand scheme of things.  I'm currently on part 4/6 of the Web Planet, from the middle of season 2.  And I've really enjoyed it, though I can't just watch it endlessly like I could with modern DW.  The old series has to be taken with many grains of salt, as so much of what the show has become was established later on.  The pacing is much slower, and the effects are usually laughable.  The character of the Doctor has a long way to go, as you've already seen.  He's pretty much a selfish jerk.  But he does warm up.  Plus Barbara and Ian are fantastic companions.  Neither one is incompetent, though Barbara does get to do her fair share of screaming.  But she gets her moments as well.

As far as which stories are worth it, You've seen the first one, which I didn't love.  I do love An Unearthly Child just because it's the first, but the cavemen didn't enthrall me greatly.  But next is the Daleks.  And while it's a bit longer than it needs to be, it's absolutely necessary viewing.  The end of the episode with the cliffhanger where Barbara is cornered by the mystery creature is fantastic, and while we all know what's coming, it's still a great introduction for the Doctor's oldest enemies.  Also, I love that even going by the show's run, they're the oldest of his recurring foes.  The Edge of Destruction is filler, and nothing special, but it's one episode, so go for it.  The Keys of Marinus is also a bit long, and kind of all over the place.  But the Aztecs is amazing, especially for Barbara.  But everyone has their moments here.  Somehow, I missed the Sensorites.  Also, I didn't watch any stories that were partially or completely lost, though I may go back to them eventually.

In Season 2, Planet of Giants is alright, but nothing particularly stand-out for me.  The Dalek Invasion of Earth is pretty cool.  More Daleks, on-location filming, and the first departure of a companion on the show.  The Rescue introduces a new companion to fill the newly-opened gap.  And then The Romans is great.  It's actually funny, which was kind of a first for the show.  The Web Planet is not shaping up to be a favorite of mine, but perhaps that will change.  But there are just so many required leaps of faith and logic, even for someone with little trouble suspending belief.

Beyond these ancient episodes, I've only seen one or two scattered ones.  I've seen the Time Warrior, notable for introducing Sarah Jane Smith, the name of Gallifrey, and the Sontarans.  And I've seen the Five Doctors, which is just endlessly amusing to me.  We really need a modern proper multiple Doctor story.

Edit: Having now finished it, the Web Planet did get better in the last couple of episodes, but those Menoptera (giant butterfly dudes) were just bizarre.  Their movements and speech patterns bothered me till the end, as did, to a lesser extent, those of the underground Optera.  The Zarbi were pretty gnarly though.  And the voice of the Animus was pretty creepy, so it was alright overall in the end.",0,1347241212,null,0,1347249523,0,c65xg7k,t3_zmfs7,t1_c65xg7k,t3_zmfs7,null,1429860041,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Well, I was being glib about paying for that one project specifically. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiership_of_Margaret_Thatcher#Deflationary_strategy) for the nitty gritty. It was a core Tory scheme to change the fiscal landscape of the UK. Using the oil to change the currency rate was a key part of it. 

That oil could have instead went to a fund keeping the country (Scotland or the UK) safe in times of trouble such as the present. Instead it was blown to make London a bankers paradise. The answer to the question ""would we be better off?"" is surely ""hell yes"". 

&gt; notably selling off nationalised industries?

A drop in the ocean. Getting cash in hand is not the objective for these sell offs, it's the realisation of a political goal. Some might say it's more about giving juicy contracts to your friends in the private sector who'll surely remember that when you leave politics and need some ""consulting"" work... ;-)

People on benefits and low wages have to be cunning and claim what they can to make ends meet.

This is before we even consider the positive feedback loop that is being out of work - employers don't want you which means you spend longer on benefits and so the cycle repeats.
Sure one could retrain but employers want work experience for even the most basic jobs even if the ad doesn't state it as they need a method to sort applicants (I heard that one employer tossed out half of the forms without opening them justifying it by saying the candidates were unlucky - not sure if true or not) but even try getting feedback on why one failed instead of the letter everyone knows is insincere and is basically a template.

^1 as in rare contrary to what the article (clearly designed to incited hatred of this man and his circumstances) would have you believe is common.

Some breeders will let you choose a name but my experience has always been that the breeder chooses or I'm given a naming theme to fall into. Gali's litter had a time naming theme so all the registration names had to do with time and the puppy owners where encouraged to come up with a time related name. I like unusual names for dogs so it worked in my favour. A friend got a litter mate and named her Era with the registration name ""A New Beginning"". In my case the breeder tried to come up with reg names that fit the owner given name ie Bailey was also ""Happy Hour"", Remington was ""The Write Time"" and mine was ""Once Upon a Time"". These reg names for the most part do nothing but if you ever show or breed your dog that's how the kennel club keeps track of individual dogs.

Yes, sometimes. It depends.

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"Everyone here seems to be assuming this is about people on benefits. That may not be the case.

Case in point, some of my earliest memories were of my father and I eating dinner in our 1-bedroom flat, my mother wouldn't eat, or claim she'd had dinner earlier. I'd been in that flat with her all day, if she'd eaten, I'd have known. My young mind didn't pick up on what she was really saying until years later, but by that time she had divorced, remarried and we were in a better situation financially.

This was in the early nineties. During a time of not immense financial difficulty or recession. Maybe 91 or 92. 

My mother worked as a secretary, my father worked, but I don't recall where or in what way. I later knew that their financial difficulty was not due to them not earning enough, but more to do with my father's spending habits and tendency to lend money he couldn't afford to lend, then never ask for it back.

Recklessness, perhaps. However, the point stands that if a little recklessness could do that to a family with two working parents then I can see how a family with one working parent in recession could have to cut back on food, especially given that since the early nineties, we have higher VAT, higher other taxes and higher prices, whilst wages may not necessarily have risen to cover those costs. While the income tax threshhold has risen steadily over the past few years, that may mean next to nothing if the family isn't earning enough to pay it in the first place.

As a point of reference, London is a hell of a lot more expensive to live in than Wigan, and if we go with a family of three as an example, then if the father works nearby then moving away isn't nearly as complete a solution. Train tickets are on the rise, and if a family can't afford food then I doubt the ever rising petrol prices will be acceptable to them either.

The situation is plausible. Improbable, but plausible.",0,1347243937,null,0,false,0,c65y3z9,t3_zmcnm,t1_c65y3z9,t3_zmcnm,null,1429860352,29,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,29

There could be something about their names falling into disuse or becoming forbidden once they sever ties with Gallifrey. Even retroactively it works well. The Doctor runs into old Gallifreyan acquaintances like Kampo or Azmael and is greeted as 'The Doctor'.

The theory can actually makes sense. The Doctor assumes he's the only Time Lord not inside the lock. Assuming this lock can't be opened from the inside, he may believe he's the only one outside the lock who would ever know his name. River knowing his name would certainly prove she was a pretty big deal to a Doctor on his first meeting with her.

It's still an interesting thought to see where they're going with this, and it could possibly lead to some Valeyard type stuff. A line that has really gotten me from season 5 is when The Doctor is explaining The Pandorica, and how it was probably a clever wizard trapped the 'bad thing' that was inside the Pandorica. River says that she hates clever wizards, because they always end up being The Doctor. Of course, we know that it was the other way around, that The Doctor was the one inside the box, not the one doing the trapping...or do we know that?

true,lowkeyoh,null,null,"I'm going to spout a line of reasoning that i'm pretty sure is 60-85% made up.  So back in the day, the television got invented.  Your major networks start broadcasting content, and anyone with a TV could tune in and watch.  All you need is some patience and fiddle around with the rabbit ears enough and it came in loud and clear. Now, because of the lack of control consumers have over the media they consume, a watchdog group was invented to preside over all this nonsense, the FCC.  Wiki lists the FCC's mission statement as this

 ""make available so far as possible, to all the people of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication services with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.""  The Act furthermore provides that the FCC was created ""for the purpose of the national defense"" and ""for the purpose of promoting safety of life and property through the use of wire and radio communications.""

Keep in mind this is 1934 so they don't care about colored people, women, or nonamericans, but the rest kinda stands.  TV and Radio is a way to get news into the home of the American consumer.  If a national  disaster occurs, or war breaks out, or something of that magnitude happens, a direct link into the homes of citizens is something that sounds very attractive to the Government.  So in exchange for letting pushing TV onto citizens, they Government decided to try to keep it accessible and safe for the entire family.  That's the key here.

Any kid could turn on channel 3 and watch what's on, so concerned parents turned to the government to make sure that when the kid does, he won't see something that isn't appropriate.  TV evolves into what it is today, and the rules just kinda stuck.

Owning a television is almost a 'right'.  You have the right to be informed to current events.  You have a right to PBS.  You have the right that your children won't be subjected to mature content.  However that only holds for the basic stuff.  Once you elect to get premium channels, the FCC doesn't care whats on it.  You can always NOT get HBO.  But the choice is between having TV or not having TV, then they step in.

I think if he pulled a 'Doctor strangling Peri' type ordeal that the BBC would probably not like that very much, especially with how well that went over the first time! What I'd love to see, though, are some real moral dilemmas. With RTD we got these build up towards heavy and dark moral decisions that The Doctor would have to make(Such as shooting The Master/Rassilon during The End of Time), which would ultimately be a cop out in which The Doctor finds some third solution that has no moral implications.

&gt;Uses a Boarduino (arduino variant) and an in-line photocell/transistor circuit. Light shines on the photocell, computer turns on. Pretty simple. Yes, you could turn it on with a regular flash light. But using a sonic screwdriver is way more awesome ^_^

true,lemonheadian,null,null,"Hi Doctor Who friend. I'd like to talk to you about nostalgia and what it can do to our perception of shows. It isn't always pretty, but I'd like to take you on a walk down memory lane real quick. This is the show that brought amazing monsters, deep connections, and occasionally fun, silly romps into nonsense. While the show is consistently entertaining, I'd like to remind you that this is the show that brought us a two-parter of farting aliens (plus a recurrence of this particular awful creature), televisions attacking people, a killer reality show host, the episode Love and Monsters (which I admittedly love but realize it's writing was rough), adorable creatures made of fat, a human-wasp alien hybrid man of the cloth, pirates being attacked by aliens, a little alien boy who becomes someone's son without them noticing, and much more. 

Writing can be spotty at times, especially when they have so many different writers for each series. But I want you to remember that silly often comes a few episodes before serious and that it is a lovely 43 minutes of television.

I rewatched the two episodes after you posted this. Just wanted to be sure I was being honest with my viewing thoughts. I could not have found anything to cut on ASotD, but I will admit I would have like to have seen expansion. But I arrived at the twist exactly when Moffat wanted me to notice, and more expansion would have ruined the last 15 minutes or so. 

DoaS was a fun romp, but it didn't need anything more. But she (Nefertiti) did say that the Doctor had just saved her people, and they had been through a lot together. Ridell is supposedly to be sort of anonymous, I would think. If we knew more, we'd be chastising Amy for not knowing him. This was not about lasting connections, the Doctor just wanted more buddies along. 

But I go into each episode expecting to be entertained for 45 minutes with a semi-outlandish premise. After all, aren't most of them?

As far as your Amy-Rory dislike, I can see where this is coming from. I personally really liked the Ponds so far. I was growing weary of the story but the long break and more positive writing has been good to them. Amy's not screaming every 10 minutes so far, and for that, I am grateful!

It will be a new feel with a new companion, and I welcome the change. But that's not because I find this writing to be bad, but because I always enjoy how many different perspectives one show can have. I really hope you continue to enjoy Doctor Who, and know that if you're not particularly satisfied, this is the show that is known for morphing and changing and becoming an entirely new entity often. Just remember the farting aliens and think of how far we've come, and how much change we've yet to experience!

(You didn't say anything about being an classic Who watcher, so I tried to stay in the 2005 - onwards time frame, but if you'd like that recap, I'd love to give it)

true,TheLushCompanion,mcgann,McGann,"The show has been going for 49 years. It's changed over that time. Numerous times. Eleven Doctors. Heaven only knows how many companions. Different head writers, producers, etc. If you don't like Moffat's take on it, that's fine. But it's still the Doctor, and there's still enjoyment to be had. A lot of people hated Colin Baker. I think he's a fine Doctor. Some people loved Tennant. Some people thought he was whiney and emo. Some people idolize Tom Baker, and some people really don't get him at all. I have my favorite Doctors, and my favorite stories. But even in the worst story, there's still good stuff. So, stop watching and don't find out where the story's going if you feel you must, but I'd suggest sticking around. Because no matter what happens, eventually there will be another Doctor, another producer, another show runner. You wouldn't want to have to get all caught up all over again would you? Also, keep in mind, you've devoured this show at a faster pace than it was meant to be watched. I think regenerations sometimes need a bit of breathing space, so you can process what just happened, take a deep breath and get to know the Doctor's new personality and quirks with a fresh palate. Edit: I don't know what the fuck with the angels. Seriously.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"I think people expect The Doctor to be this picture perfect entity that always does the right thing, and would never do anything deemed 'immoral' by the standards of the viewer. This is just wrong, and The Doctor is a person just like anyone else. Yes, he will try and take the moral high ground whenever it suits him, but he's not always going to have that option, or even feel obligated to take that course of action(As seen in Dinosaurs).

The Doctor can be ruthless, whether because he needs to be, or because he's looking in the eyes of someone who caused genocide as well as pain towards those he cares about(Tricy/Rory's dad). Given the right circumstances, The Doctor can be merciless. The only thing is that most episodes, he isn't given those circumstances. Most episodes he finds some way in which everyone can survive, and that the bad guy wasn't really a bad guy after all.

The Doctor even admits this himself, although not very often. Remember in Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead he tells the Vashta Nerada that they just killed someone he likes, and that they shouldn't push him like that. After looking him up in the library, they realize that he's telling the truth, and that he can be a very scary force to reckon with when you mess with those he cares about/likes.

Or, of course, you could just watch the best ones. Classic Doctor Who has only a handful of serials that rely on any previous episodes for plot or character information.

My favorite serials (not counting reconstructions):

* The Aztecs (Season 1)
* The Romans (Season 2)
* The Time Meddler (Season 2)
* The Tomb of the Cybermen (Season 5)
* The Mind Robber (Season 6)
* Inferno (Season 7)
* The Claws of Axos (Season 8)
* The Sea Devils (Season 9)
* The Three Doctors (Season 10)
* The Green Death (Season 10)
* The Ark in Space (Season 12)
* Genesis of the Daleks (Season 12)
* Terror of the Zygons (Season 13)
* Pyramids of Mars (Season 13)
* The Seeds of Doom (Season 13)
* The Talons of Weng-Chiang (Season 14)
* City of Death (Season 17)
* Caves of Androzani (Season 21)

Also watch the Key to Time arc (all of Season 16), the E-Space Trilogy (Season 18, ""Full Circle,"" ""State of Decay,"" ""Warriors' Gate""), and the following ""Returns"" trilogy (Season 18/19, ""Keeper of Traken,"" ""Logopolis,"" ""Castrovalva"").",0,1347259245,null,0,false,0,c661b2z,t3_zmfs7,t1_c661b2z,t3_zmfs7,null,1429861924,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,TheLushCompanion,mcgann,McGann,"If I were a companion, I'd like to be a Time Lord. 

I'd be younger than the Doctor, in my first incarnation. I was politically active as a student in the Arcalian chapter of the Academy. It bothered me that the non-Time Lord Gallifreyan citizens did not have full representation in the Council, and I, along with a lot of other liberal rabble rouser types agitated for better treatment for the outsiders. When I receieved the Imprimatur of Rassilon upon achieving the rank of Junior Time Lord, I chose the name ""The Advocate"" for myself to reflect that aspect of my beliefs and personality. 

As graduation neared, my classmates and I started to hear more and more about the war with the Daleks. We were fairly sheltered, but eventually, even the halls of academia could no longer keep out the harsh reality. Gallifrey was in danger. President Romanadvoratrelundar was recalled in a vote of no confidence, and Lord President Rassilon was retrieved from the Matrix to lead his people in their darkest hour. 

Whisperings of military defeats flew around the corridors, but as battles were fought, and refought as each side travelled in time to undo the others' victories. Time Lords died, regenerated, and died again. The High Council recalled all Time Lords from every point in history to defend Gallifrey. Even renegade Time Lords came home to serve, or were resurrected. The Council granted all Time Lords an entire new cycle of regenerations to give us a strategic edge, and still outposts crumbled, alliances shattered. 

Finally, on one black day, my classmates and I were called to an assembly. Coordinator Rellox, director of the Arcalian Center for Temporal Research, addressed us directly. Arcadia was under Dalek attack. We were needed on the front lines. We were rushed through a hasty graduation ceremony. Lord President Rassilon himself addressed us, praising our courage, thanking us for our sacrifice. We didn't know then that we were merely cannon fodder, serving to buy him time to impliment his Ultimate Sanction. 

As Arcalians, it was our job to monitor the time lines of the battle. To prevent, if possible, the rewriting of victories. I was bonded with an obsolete type 70 TARDIS and given an area of space to monitor. The battle was brutal. To a non-Time Aware species, it would have appeared horrific. To the temporally sensitive Time Lords it was hell. Timelines fluxed, merged, popped out of existence. Arcadia burned and fell, the Daleks were beaten back, our TARDISes were destroyed, in an endless maelstrom of chaos. 

A Dalek saucer entered my section of space. Battle TARDISes converged on it. It had happened, will have happened already, too many times to count, but this time was different. A barrage of time torpedoes from the battle TARDISes froze the Dalek ship in place, but not before it activated its neutron strike. Powerful enough to take out a sun, it destroyed several battle TARDISes, ripping the fabric of time itself. 

My ship fell toward the eddy of space time. I tried to pilot away from it.  A type 70 can theoretically escape a temporal distortion grid, but given the constant rewriting of timelines, this was more complex. The last thing I remembered was my ship screaming, or was it me, as her exochronoplasmic shell was breached by the residual temporal energy storm. 

I awoke in the burned out hulk of my ship's control room. Life support seemed functional, but little else. I rose to my feet, unsteady. It took a moment for the strangeness to resolve itself, for me to realize I had regenerated. I set about trying to discover where and when I was. Once I'd determined that to the best of my ability, I activated my ship's distress beacon. 

The response to my distress signal took longer than I'd expected; weeks. By the time another TARDIS landed, I'd managed to become thoroughly discouraged by the severity of the damage to my ship. Frankly, if it was going to be repaired at all, it would have to be at the TARDIS facilities on Gallifrey. Hearing the distinctive sound of an older TARDIS's engines, I went out to greet my fellow Time Lord. 

Okay that covers backstory and how I would meet the Doctor. As far as personality traits, I think Cate is idealistic, countercultural and at least a little naive. She may not get on with the Doctor at all, as I sincerely doubt she'll take the news of Gallifrey's fall well. I think the Doctor would be ambivalent toward her. Sure she's a Time Lord, one of his own people, but she has little to no practical experience, and so her people's natural arrogance will probably irritate him to no end. It will be very interesting though.
