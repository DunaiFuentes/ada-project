Once again all stats are from police.uk it doesn't get anymore official also they are adjusted for population size as it says underneath. If you choose to disbelieve the official stats in favour of some anecdotes then you need to re-evaluate your thought process.

true,saiyanhajime,null,null,"Thorpe Park is well worth a visit. It's a bit chavy and gross, but you cannot beat the thrill lineup there. It's also very close to Chessington, a park more aimed at families, but they have some nice stuff there, lovely environments and a combined zoo. Legoland is also close, but I think the place is a right dump, but hey.

Flamingoland is pretty good... They have great variation, a great zoo and some interesting rides. The nearby Lightwater Valley has very little to do, however... It's home to what is, in my opinion, the best roller coaster in the country. The Ultimate. Why's it the best? Because it's actually terrifying, and that's rare. You could easily do both parks in the same day.

Drayton Manor is an absolute dump, in my opinion. Crap rides in a crap environment, but they do have the Europe's only stand up roller coaster and a cool drop ride with a stand up option.

Oakwood isn't worth the trek. They have an outstanding wooden coaster, and then a load of crap. Oh, but the toboggan is awesome!

Pure speed will never get any player anywhere. Especially a #9. A #9's biggest assets are awareness, timing and instinct; along with speed. A player with pure speed will never be able to time his runs well unless he's had hours and hours of practice over many years. 

Real life isn't FIFA. In FIFA create a player with Bolt-like speed, and other attributes shit; he'll probably be picked by every player to simply go past defenders and make a short pass to a team mate.

- Jones **6** At fault for their goal but looked solid afterwards. Confident in his box.

- Coates **8** Looks really good in the ""Agger"" role as a cultured defender.

- Carragher **7** Solid

- Robinson **6** Some excellent forward runs but didn't really notice him in defense

- Wisdom **7** A mature performance for a player I didn't expect to see near the first team this soon.

- Sahin **9** Two goals and controlled the midfield. Would give him a 10 if I was feeling more generous.

- Henderson **7** Did the holding playmaker job well, I didn't notice too much as I was playing Skyrim at the same time as watching the game, hence the unnoticed but important jobs were not noticed ;)

- Downing **4** The new Harry Kewell in the sense that he's obviously talented but he's never going to perform well for us. Didn't contribute offensively at all.

- Assaidi **9** It's been so long since Liverpool have had a winger that can beat players this well. Lovely jubbly.

- Pacheco **6** You all seem to think he played well but I didn't notice him in attack, only tracking back. (Again, Skyrim)

- Yesil **6** Looked very energetic but didn't make many chances for my liking. Looks like a quality player nonetheless.

- I'd give Suso an **8** for his cameo and Sinclair a **5** but ten minutes is hardly enough time for a rating to be fair. ",0,1348694096,null,0,false,0,c6dvj4y,t3_10iy4w,t1_c6dvj4y,t3_10iy4w,null,1429999052,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Ok fair enough on the threats, but I still disagree with your proposal - an act should be either legal or illegal based on the end result, not the methods used.

If I steal £20 from you it is a crime. It doesn't matter if I took it from your hand, your back pocket, your online bank account, your jar of petty cash or from your wall safe - the same crime has been committed each time.

If we decide that offensive messages are illegal then that should be the end of it. It shouldn't change just because it was said face to face, or by text, by post, by email, by twitter, by carrier pigeon, by semaphore or by walkie talkie.

I think you're also forgetting about the very serious stalkers and trolls who harrass victims through as many mediums as they can. What would happen in a case where a victim has a bad divorce and recieved 3 polite but blunt letters from the ex, 70 normal phone calls to just ""say hi"" and over 800 vulgar and offensive messages through facebook, twitter, youtube, email, skype....

6 average.

Jones - 6. Horrific error at the start of the game and some truly awful kicking was balanced against some superb reaction saves. Mixed bag.

Wisdom - 7.5. Rather unjustly booked, but defended well for the most part and played some very nice football.

Coates - 8. What a fucking rock. Doesn't quite have Agger's on-ball style but close enough. Will be an interesting month or so.

Carra - 6.5. Had a rocky first half but did better in the second, especially after Lukaku's withdrawal.

Robinson - 7.5. Defended impeccably and hen he had the chance showed some decent attacking moves. Might struggle behind someone who plays as wide as Assaidi in future though, no space to exploit.

Henderson - 7. Poor pass led to the first goal, but was tidy afterwards. Kept the ball ticking over and was unlucky to see a couple of through balls not come off.

Sahin - 10. 2 goals and a performance that was surpassed by none. He was perfect, can't wait to see that form in the league.

Pacheco - 7. Superb shot and some decent passes but went missing for periods. More game time should bring him up to speed though.

Downing - 5. Our one weak spot tonight really. I've never seen a professional footballer with so little confidence.

Yesil - 6.5. Good first half gave way to an indifferent second as he tired. Showed hints for the future though.

Assaidi - 8.5. First assist for the club and an electric performance to go with, he had the Baggies defence running for cover and had 3 men marking him on occasion. Still managed to find a way around them.

Subs:

Suso - 7. Instantaneous impact from the young Spaniard, and followed it up with some neat passing and decent tackling.

Sinclair - N/A. Barely touched the ball but made history tonight (which will probably have annoyed Robinson). I sincerely doubt his record will ever be broken.",0,1348696162,null,0,false,0,c6dw3fk,t3_10iy4w,t1_c6dw3fk,t1_c6dvj4y,null,1429999317,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

I feel a distinction should be drawn with the internet because walking up to somebody in person and shouting insults in their face carries with it an implicit threat of violence (even if no actual threatening statement is delivered) and is disruptive to their life, whereas unleashing a string of all caps abuse to an anonymous internet stranger is not.

London itself is an amazing experience and handy to get back to the US and get over the channel see Europe if you want to (Paris is 2.5 hours by the Eurostar train through the channel tunnel). London is expensive though.

Northumbria - Newcastle is an a remarkable city (check out Geordie Shore...), Northumbria itself doesn't have the best reputation as a college however the city more than makes up for it.

Lancaster - has a great reputation as a college, but it's an out of town campus so a little insular.  It's got Manchester relatively close for partying, the Yorkshire Dales and the Lakes nearby - so if you like the outdoor life it's the place... It's also out of all of these probably got the best Student Union (student runs support services and bar / club)

Glasgow - The city is beginning to rival or beat Edinburgh for cool, the Uni has a great reputation but you need to remember that it's in Scotland, they are very particular about that.  They take rugby seriously but the Scots haven't been doing so well over the last few years... (well.... as long as I can remember).

Sci-fi/BBC/BBCA ALSO made a big deal about a 'new doctor', Moffat began writing and I'm sure pushed for more advertisment. I don't recall seeing so many commercials for it during the Tennant era.

I would probably have sold it on (or given it away, but I don't know any Stoke supporters), unless it was Crouch. But I do kinda like their red-white stripes.

I didn't request for any special team, but I did want one. I still have it, even though I support Tottenham. I'll be waiting for the day when I can burn it on my lawn dancing around in one of my 3 Spurs shirts, or until I can find someone who will be happy to have it.

true,baaseo,lfc68,,"ok. so i wasn't able to watch the game, but i did watch highlights focused on sahin. and i must say, he or assaidi is the motm for me. sahin pretty much ran the midfield and scored both goals. the first was a beauty out of no where. the second was just great positioning, which is something we've been lacking in our games. assaidi seems like he was involved in the majority of dangerous plays that we ran.

i've never felt this excited for liverpool before. there is something really special going on here. that build up for the second goal started from a throw-in from the right flank. the passes that led up to suso getting the ball were incredible. then came the perfect feint and pass to assaidi along with sahin's perfect positioning. just wow... i never thought our team could play like that. and to think that the team tonight consisted of so many youngsters!",0,1348707192,null,0,false,0,c6dyuap,t3_10iy4w,t1_c6dyuap,t3_10iy4w,null,1430000612,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Before I'm downvoted into oblivion, hear me out..

This show is obviously created for an audience outside of the UK who are not really experienced in the whole footballing culture. I'm all for the show, I think it is great that we are trying to expand our fanbase, its just moments like in Episode 2 where Rodgers tells Shelvey he's going to be a big part of the club that I dont like. It looks really really fake and put on. Even if it wasn't fake it just doesn't seem like a thing that should be broadcast to millions.That's a special thing for the manager. Then you could argue that if more people knew about it, Shelvey would get non-stop grief in England about his expectation and who knows what that would do to his performance.

true,jaysabi,tardis,TARDIS,"I've rewatched the end of The Eleventh Hour looking for this scene. You're right! This is a fantastic theory for several reasons. First, she's looking up and definitely starts to get panicky, but when she turns around, she is calm again. This is too much of a swing for it to be her being overwhelmed by the TARDIS, and it fits the pattern of how people react around the Silence in The Impossible Astronaut when seeing them for the first time. Further, we know that Silents sleep like bats on the ceilings, like where Amy was looking when she got panicky. 

Second, this would be perfectly Moffatish. I had a feeling that when he told us that the Ponds' last episode was the Angels episode that it might be intentionally misleading. He did the same thing with Jenna Louise Coleman. *'Oh, the new companion will be Clara Oswin and she'll appear in the Christmas episode.'* Then BAM! He broadsides us with Jenna Louis Coleman as Oswin Oswald in the first episode. It makes a world of sense to me that he is doing the same thing here. *'Amy and Rory will leave in the fifth episode, there will be Angels in that episode.'* Naturally, all the discussion has been about Angels since then, and I've seen a number of theories involving (false) sightings of Angels in The Eleventh Hour. I didn't list any of them in my list here because I don't believe any of them are accurate, and I'm not seeing the shadowy Angel figures in the windows that some people are claiming to see. So while we're all trying to figure out how the Angels play into the Ponds' departure, BAM! It really has to do with the Silence. That would be too Moffat! 

Well done for that! This has become my favorite theory now. But I still want an explanation for that scene of Young Amelia reacting to the TARDIS while waiting after that first night.

I've got half a mind to find the nearest brick and smash their stupid heads in...* Granted you didn't actually see the raccoons, but you heard the sound of shuffling around out back and the unruly clatter of one of your trash bins tumbling to the ground. So you grabbed your flash light, pulled on an old sweater and went outside to pick up the mess before they made it worse. 

It had rained that afternoon and you can feel the wet grass soaking the hem of your sleep pants. At least it made the air feel cleaner. You stand on the back porch for a moment and breathe deeply. It's been nothing but worries and aggravation for you these days. If everything else in your life had been going better, a few hungry vermin wouldn't have been so annoying. But your friends had been distant, your work situation stressful, your parents over-demanding-- all moreso than usual. It seemed like the little monsters were the final plague sent to upset you. If you could just get away for a little while, extricate yourself from everyone and get some genuine peace for once, maybe you'd be able to clear your head up.

But who on Earth has the time for that?

And why are you wasting yours staring at nothing?

... And what's that weird sound?

You look at the simple gate separating your house from your neighbor's. There's the most peculiar noise coming from beyond the wooden slats, a wooshing, grinding, whispery noise that's too loud to be described as whispery in the first place.

Sort of a vworping noise now that you think about it.

*Vworping...?*

The flashlight drops from your fingertips. Your spilled trash, your pest problem, the fact that it's 1 AM and you have to be up in 6 hours, that's all forgotten in favor of bolting across the grass. You know that sound, you know it well, better than anyone else in your life. They all think it's silly, this fixation you have on that sound, that box, that perfect shade of blue. It's just fairy tales and stories to them. Something fun to watch on Saturday nights. But you've known better, haven't you? Since the beginning you knew, deep down in your heart, that they weren't just fairy tales and stories. All stories had to start somewhere right?

You hit the fence between you and the neighbor's backyard. There's a door here somewhere, why did you drop your flashlight, it's got to be-- There! A latch, cold and wet from the rain, that sticks a little when you try to open it. You grab it tight and force it open. Any more force and you would have ripped the damn thing right out of the wood. The gate swings inward and you wonder where your neighbor's dog is. It should have been losing its mind over that noise and the lights now flashing in the garden. Maybe it was inside. Does it matter?

Your bare feet slap against the stone pathway in your neighbor's garden. Their house is right in front of the woods your neighborhood was built near and you can see the flashing lights between the branches. You're running blind, hoping you don't run right into a tree and spend the rest of the night unconscious on a dirty ground. There's a clearing just up ahead, it should be right...

Right there.

Right in the center of all these trees, a little piece of 1960s Britain, the most incredible shade of blue you've ever seen in all your life. There's a man in front of it as well. He's tall and slim and looking a bit amused at the sight of you in a ratty sweater and wet plaid pants.

""Hallo,"" he chirps. You have to lean against a nearby tree to keep from collapsing (you're not sure if it's from all the running or from the shock). ""Sorry about all the noise, really I had no idea it was so late, I think that bit's broken now too, didn't mean to wake you."" He rocks his arms back and forth with a bright smile on his face. ""Have you been waiting long?""

Your whole life, you'd like to say. Even before you knew him, you knew you were waiting for him. It's been a terribly long time for you. A blink of the eye to him. No wonder he was so late. Can you really hold that against him?

true,warpus,null,null,"The [League Cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Cup) is a knockout style competition which involves all teams in the top 4 tiers of English football. (Prem, championship, league 1 &amp; league 2)

It's pretty much the competition that's the lowest in terms of priority out of the 4 competitions we're usually involved in (premier league, champions league, f.a. cup, and the league cup)

The f.a. cup involves a lot more teams than the league cup..  (according to wikipedia it's 758)..  It's the world's oldest football competition, so it carries a bit more weight than the league cup, but a lot of people would argue that these days top teams don't really care that much about it either.  There is a lot more emphasis on the premier league and champions league.

Either way you'll often see teams rotate their squads for the league cup, meaning that players who do not usually get a start (or even a place on the bench) might get a chance to start.  Arsenal take it to the extreme and usually play a lot of their youngsters in both the fa cup and the league cup IIRC, but why would I go out of my way to watch arsenal games..  so that might not be fully accurate

Anyway, it is all rather confusing at first, I agree.  I would spend some time reading about the [English football pyramid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_football_pyramid).  The [history of the FA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_fa) is rather interesting as well, as it has to do with the origins of the sport...  just keep in mind that the FA are a bunch of wankers while you're reading.

The uefa super cup is just a 1 game contest between last year's winners of the uefa champions league and the uefa europa league.  The club world cup is a contest between all the continents' champions league winners, and..  the charity shield is a contest between the previous years' premier league winner and the previous years' FA cup winner.  I think that pretty much covers all the cups &amp; competitions a team at our level might be involved in.

It all rather confused me as well, even years after I was a Chelsea fan..  which is why I don't mind helping out, although you could have easily googled the articles yourself.

true,stikeymo,eng-shropshire,Salopian in San Francisco,"Yeah, SF's pricey - rent was comparable to London when I got here late last year, and it's shot up massively over the past year thanks to the tech bubble.

Sales tax is very much lower - 9.5% in San Francisco. Income tax is the killer though - for me, federal income tax comes to ~19%, social security comes to ~4%, Medicare comes to ~1.5%, California state taxes comes to 7.1%, State Disability Insurance comes to ~1% - an overall income tax rate of ~32.5%, as opposed to the figure of ~27% listed above.

(I give approximate figures as this is based off my last pay stub).

Overall, I think the cost of living for me balances out pretty evenly (for instance, food's a bit cheaper, but the tipping culture pushes prices back up if you eat out a lot). Quality of life is a bit lower though, with less vacation time and with lives more organized around work/money.

His primary intention was probably to move into areas so that he could be available to be supplied by Suso/Assaidi - moving into the space between the central defender and fullback is pretty standard, and would have given Suso the option to try and release him with a through ball. 

The fact that his movement dragged defenders out of shape so much is a secondary effect, although I still credit him for doing it - he could have stayed central, leaving Assaidi as Suso's only option, then waited for Assaidi's cross, which might have been blocked by the WBA right-back who wouldn't have had any reason to pull in narrowly. 

But he works really hard to get in perfect position should Suso want to feed him. He knows where he needs to be, he works hard to get there, and that's still commendable.

But, that doesn't necessarily mean that the question of whether homeopathy should receive funding is invalid. The question is more whether it's a valuable service for some people, and whether the placebo effect gained from homeopathy is useful or beneficial in any way. Bear in mind that it also involves an element of talk therapy, getting someone to go through their problems in detail with a ""therapist"", which can often be beneficial too.

It may be that every £1 spent on homeopathy means you save £2 which would otherwise be spent on more expensive, unnecessary medication in some cases where a patient would get better anyway. Or it may not be the case. Or it may be the case that even if you save money by doing that, it's still outweighed by the downside of promoting homeopathy as a valid alternative to proper medicine.

~~However, if the burglars start threatening you, then shooting to kill becomes a proportionate response, because you are then defending your life instead of your property.~~  
  
--edit--  
  
I stand by my general point that if somebody is not a clear threat to your safety, then killing them is not a proportionate response.  But some of you have brought up valid points regarding accuracy, split-second decision-making making in the dark, and the idea that shooting to wound is generally a bad idea anyway.  iticu's link in particular presents a compelling argument.  
  
With those points in mind, I think that perhaps a warning that you are armed is the appropriate first course of action.  ""I'm armed - leave right now or I'll kill you"".  If they don't respond to that warning by leaving within a few seconds then it could be reasonable to assume that they are a threat to your safety, at which point shooting to kill becomes proportionate.  You go straight from 'not shooting at all' to 'shoot to kill' in the space of a few seconds.

I think it is reasonable to adopt a ""shoot first, ask questions later"" policy in these situations. You could shout ""I'm armed!

Not only could you hit the femoral artery (which will lead to your target bleeding out quite rapidly), the round could easily ricochet off of the bone and cut through the chest. It's also easier to miss the leg entirely, which given the Tueller Drill might result in your own death. Guns are deadly weapons, and if you engage someone with a gun then you are engaging them with deadly force, regardless of your desire to kill or not. So if you do shoot someone then you should always aim for the center of mass which is the easiest thing to hit, and shoot twice. If you don't want to risk killing the person, don't shoot at them.

EDIT:
Regarding your edit, while I do think that one should be able to use lethal force in the event of a home invasion I don't think we should have a shoot first, ask questions later stance (unless a rare situation warranted it). A clear warning should be given and the emphasis should be on making the person leave or surrender, not on killing them whilst the run down the street with your kettle. But if you are backed into a corner or the attackers intent is clearly not theft then you should have legal protection if you shoot and kill them.

However, this is all moot. Hardly anyone has genuine guns in this country, and the most that the majority of people would have is an airsoft gun or a airgun. With the airsoft, all you can really do is threaten someone with it and if they do go for you then your probably going to die/end up in hospital. So the best option you have in that situation is to lock yourself in a room or use a makeshift cudgel. If you have an air gun, something that fires 0.177/0.22 and is far from lethal, then I would probably just engage the attacker without warning. It won't kill the person, but it will hurt like hell and they will have to go to hospital to get the pellets removed.

&gt;Hate crimes are taken to mean any crime where the perpetrator's hostility or prejudice against an identifiable group of people is a factor in determining who is victimised.

So really, it should be treated as a hate crime already.  Knocking the fuck out of someone because of the music they listen to and the clothes they wear is just as unacceptable as doing it because of someones' race or religion.  The police don't take it very seriously, though.  Never have.

&gt;But I don't think you have really thought this through. The inevitable conclusion of this thinking is that most crimes would end up being labelled as ""hate"" crimes because invariably everyone falls into a sub-culture, and invariably other people ""hate"" them because of it.

Not really.  For something to be a hate crime, there has to be something to show that the criminal's prejudices played a part.  It's the difference between ""give me your wallet"" and ""Oi, pakki, hand over your phone.""  Most crimes aren't motivated like that, though, but a lot of violence towards little moshers *is*.

true,TakenByVultures,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"&gt;Metal festivals and shows have a huge white majority; this is more apparent in extreme sub-genres (black metal particularly). This is not necessarily a problem in itself, 

It isn't a problem full stop.

&gt;but there are a lot of right-wing bands and outright racist ones. 

Are there alot? How many in comparison to non-right-wing and racist bands? You're attempting to tar and feather a massively diverse spectrum of music with one particularly large and judgmental brush. 

As mentioned - I've been a part of the 'metal' scene for my entire life and I've attended and worked at thousands of gigs/festivals and I have NEVER seen a white power band on a stage.

The same cannot be said of the gangster rap/hip hop scene - some of the most popular acts are overtly racist and homophobic.

&gt;So when you combine almost entirely white audiences with a scene that incorporates lyrics and/or ideologies that are aggressive towards people who are not white, that makes for a hostile environment.

Bullshit. Example of lyrics and/or such ideaolgies prevalent at modern UK rock/metal/alt festivals? 

&gt;Most metal fans I've met have been very comfortable with the use of racist slurs, apparently because they feel OK to do that within a 'white' group where they will not be challenged. 

I've never experienced this. As I say, the metal scene I know is incredibly diverse. 

&gt;There isn't a good reason for somebody to select their favourite music genre based on the colour of their skin.

I don't agree, there is a wealth of writing from  variety of perspectives on this very topic.  Not to mention that it has taken hundreds of years to get to the position we are currently at with regards to the capitalist conception of private property, and, even now the courts are regularly called upon to make decisions as to its finer and even sometimes its more fundamental points.  Any other system of property rights would evolve similarly.  Try following any debate between the less doctrinaire and more sophisticated right wing libertarian thinkers and their mutualist counterparts to see how tied up in knots its possible to become when you explore private property (in the Lockean sense) from first principles.

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"It's still nowhere near as high as has been historically though. 

I mean look at this yearly [GDP vs Debt graph,](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Z_3bgQQpLBE/TL_tYYSpP6I/AAAAAAAAAE4/6_NAPKhXUmg/s400/debt-gdp.jpg) we're nowhere near what we were post WW2 and we survived that quite nicely.  

This government needs to stop pretending that we're in the shit here and start to move the emphasis away from deficit reduction and towards job creation. We don't need bullshit austerity measures, we need to kick start the economy, constantly complaining about national debt being out of control is having exactly the opposite effect, it's stagnating our economy.

We'll end up in a depression here if we're not careful by continuing to follow this rhetoric. 

Edit: I will add that if you really want an overview of why then I recommend two books. One is [""Economics in one lesson""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_in_One_Lesson)  Henry Hazlitt's book on free market economics. One for its insight into how free markets work, but also its American view of why welfare states don't work ( which I guarantee will have you wanting to rip the damn thing up)  It's also a good insight into our own governments right wing economic thinking. In fact it'll leave wondering if our government are not writing their own policies straight after reading this.

And two: Pual Krugmans Book [""End this depression now""](http://www.amazon.co.uk/End-This-Depression-Paul-Krugman/dp/0393088774) which demonstrates why deficits don't matter because when you put into action  policies that stimulate as opposed to stagnate an economy what seems like a huge amount of debt now, disappears in the overall economic expansion i.e. all you have to do is look after the debt interest payments and the actually debt amount takes care of itself.  The part about America never actually paying back its WW2 debt because the amount they borrowed shrank in monetary terms as their economy expanded is a real eye opener.

BUT! It's not *just* drawing and doodling. You have to learn and understand how to draw as well. Otherwise, you'll just be practicing bad habits and reinforcing them. Most people draw what they see, and zoom in their focus to whatever specific point they're drawing. The problem with that is sure, you'll get the little details, but your proportions end up being all over the place, or one eye is higher than the other, or the nose ends up looking crooked, etc.   

That's the biggest hurdle to most casual doodlers. The answer: framing.   What you want to do is break down a person (or whatever) into basic shapes and forms. Draw those out FIRST. Those boxes, circles and lines will act as a guide as you continue drawing, so that you can focus in on the little details *and* put them in the right place.

That seems more than a little far fetched.

Lets take a look at that. 

First of all, we have the statement of one member of staff that she did not recognise them as students, not that they definitely weren't. Blackburn isn't a small college - its one of the largest in the country - and it is the start of a new academic year so they may be students.

Secondly, they would have no choice than to expel the students if it turned out they were. Students for which they receive money from the government for. And with the students being Asian, there would no doubt end up being some ""we're being unfairly targetted"" rubbish go on where other Asian students could threaten or their families threaten to pull out. Which means more loss of government money. And with Blackburn having a high Asian population and there probably being a fair few in the college, can you see them wanting to take a chance of all that govt money walking out of the door?",0,1348751165,null,0,1348751463,0,c6e5pr1,t3_10k10x,t1_c6e5pr1,t1_c6e4who,null,1430003916,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

The question with these verses is not how someone interprets it; it's what Paul originally wrote, or rather what he *meant*.

Now I consider his open support for women leaders to be the strongest possible evidence that these verses don't mean what the sexists/anti-christians would have me to believe. 

The options then are that Paul was schizophrenic, changed his mind (sometimes within the same letter), or that people have read too far, over-applied or misapplied these verses into meaning something that he never intended. 

The concept isn't that troublesome; we all accept the importance of context in everyday life. If Obama quotes Hitler, did he mean it as endorsement of Hitler, or was he making a point in opposition to Hitler? The only way we know is reading the surrounding text and looking at Obama's other writings.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_in_music_cognition

Effect of culture

Culturally bound preferences and familiarity for music begin in infancy and continue through adolescence and adulthood.[1][5] People tend to prefer and remember music from their own cultural tradition.[1]

Familiarity for culturally regular meter styles is already in place for young infants of only a few months' age.[1] The looking times of 4- to 8-month old Western infants indicate that they prefer Western meter in music, while Turkish infants of the same age prefer both Turkish and Western meters (Western meters not being completely unfamiliar in Turkish culture). Both groups preferred either meter when compared with arbitrary meter.[1]

In addition to influencing preference for meter, culture affects people's ability to correctly identify music styles. Adolescents from Singapore and the UK rated familiarity and preference for excerpts of Chinese, Malay, and Indian music styles.[5] Neither group demonstrated a preference for the Indian music samples, although the Singaporean teenagers recognized them. Participants from Singapore showed higher preference for and ability to recognize the Chinese and Malay samples; UK participants showed little preference or recognition for any of the music samples, as those types of music are not present in their native culture.[5]",0,1348752970,null,0,1348753623,0,c6e61os,t3_10k13e,t1_c6e61os,t1_c6e5doz,null,1430004074,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Assaidi is definitely a steal at what we payed and a real threat (don't forget he is young too--24).  But he has to start getting first team minutes, even if its just as an impact sub against lesser PL squads. His pace, passing, crossing, and ability to take on players is something we really miss. He can also play multiple positions up front and really has an excellent work rate.

Coates is a boss, no other way to put it. He looks so promising for a defender at his age. His height is a huge plus and like you said, he can make the tackle as well. And it really seems like every match he plays in he has a few great chances (which he usually converts).  I think this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EEiro08kxM) says everything you need to about how much promise he has as an attacking threat.

Suso looked great. He will start getting more minutes in the first team and well deserved. He may need a new contract soon as well as Sterling because Spain will come calling.

I think River does qualify as a Timelord.   In the sense of the new series there's been implications that Gallifreyans become Timelords when they're exposed to the time vortex (Untempered Schism) at the academy.  The exposure to the time vortex changes them and gives them the ability to perceive time differently and grants them the ability to regenerate.  

When Rose looked into it she gained incredible powers but almost burned herself up as she was too old.  I'm thinking you have to be exposed to (or in River's case conceived in) the time vortex before your fully mature for it not to eat you up.

The reason only the Gallifreyans have the crazy regeneration powers they do is because they're method of time travel is so different than anyone else.  Daleks and Time Agents hop right to where they want to go, Gallifreyan's travel through, and are exposed to the raw vortex itself.

Basically River is a Human Timelord, while the Doctor is a Gallifreyan Timelord.

Both cost £50 and require a cabinet fixed to a solid wall in your house a long with a legitimate reason for ownership and a interview with local police (though the guy interviewing you might be a civlian)Self defense not being a legitimate reason.

Shotgun is relatively easy to get , simply say ""clay pigeon shooting"" and ,unless your a criminal or clearly mental during the interview, have a secure cabinet you will get your licence in a month or two. With this you can buy any over and under (2 shot) or any pump/semi automatic with a magazine limited to 2 shots (so 2+1). Most makes do autos in this variety (Remington,  beretta, benelli etc). Can buy as much ammo as I want (but not slugs)


Now I don't have a firearms (yet) but this is how I understand it to work. This is harder to get and requires one of two situations. Either be a member of a club (after 6 month probation) or have land permission to shoot on. If you meet one or both of these apply and get your licence like the shotgun . Unlike the shotgun you can't now go buy whatever you want. You need to apply for variations on your licence for different calibres and ammo limits. If I shoot rabbit, I can apply for a suitable caliber (.22) but not say , .50 cal. if your a member of a club that shoots on a range that's pretty big say, 1000m you can put in for any calibre you want really...223 all the way up to .50.

As for the type of guns on this licence,  most are bolt. Semi autos are limited to .22 only and shotguns with magazine more than 2 . pistols on mainland UK are banned for most all purposes.

 consequences of their behavior. [16] Behavioral changes associated with drunkenness are, to some

 degree, contextual. [17][18] A scientific study [weasel words] found that people drinking in a social setting significantly and dramatically altered their behavior immediately after the first sip of

 alcohol, [citation needed] well before the chemical itself could have filtered through to the nervous system.

But, just to entertain that point - was the Fulham game a first or second team game? Because we lost that one, and I daresay it was a second team game considering we had the FA Cup final the next weekend. 

Also, not sure you can count Assaidi as a second team player for last season, considering **he wasn't at the club last season**. Also, Assaidi hasn't forced his way into the starting 11 yet. Are you sure you don't mean Borini? But again, my point stands - he wasn't at the club last season. 

I never suggested we should play a team based on value, it should certainly be on ability. But my point is, ability isn't just a result of whether games are won or not, it's also about actual level of performance. Wisdom and Robinson had good games and will get first-team chances, but was either of their performances better than Glen Johnson's have been thus far? One of them might get a shot in Kelly's absence, sure, and both of them have performed better than Enrique so no complaints about them being in the team ahead of him on current form.

A tablet requires a completely different sort of hand-eye coordination, as your pen is not where your drawing is. Sometimes you want to turn your paper around to draw from a different angle; definitely does not work with a tablet.

I only have one problem with that: Rory's dad (Brian) encountered the Doctor in both PoT and DoaS, but he was shocked in DoaS when the Doctor ""TARDIS-napped"" him, his son and his daughter-in-law.  He was taking it rather casually, though, in PoT when the Doctor showed up to check out the cubes, and when the Doctor, Rory and Amy took off in the TARDIS in the middle of the party and was gone for a while.

I can't wrap my head around a way that the episodes would be in that order for Amy, but not for Brian.  I want it to be right, because all along I've thought that for the Doctor, Series 7 episodes 2, 3 and 4 took place for him AFTER #5 does.

Something like a Volkswagen Fox 1.2 (2008) will be around the £2800 mark to buy. 48mpg. Insurance group 1 (cheapest insurance group). £120 road tax. 

It's only 4 years old so you can actually get a reasonably price warranty that even covers wear and tear. £24 a month for the warranty which covers MOT repairs. 

This should provide relatively no nasty surprise car use.  

Insurance is impossible to say so I'm not counting that. 


Car loan = £91.13 a month (£2800 loan over 3 years @ 11.1%)

Comprehensive car warranty =  £24 a month. (Optional but at a minimum you should be ring fencing £20 a month into another account for MOT repairs.)

Tax = £10 a month

So you're looking at about £125 before insurance. £50 a month insurance is pretty average as long as you're over 23 years old. 

So £175 + fuel a month.

I am going to presume that you mean 1963 old series and not early 2005 series.
In that case here´s what I did.
I have a problem with black and white movies or series, it tends to get to unreal for me, that´s properly just an annoying nack I have that I can´t shake. So what I did was start with the Third Doctor Season 7 Jon Pertwee.
If you don´t have that problem maybe start from an unearthly child? (I haven´t seen any of the black and white yet so can´t say though)
Currently I´m watching some with Tom Baker, Fourth Doctor. He´s awsome, but then in his own way so was Pertwee, I really enjoy the old show, so long as I keep them separated in the way that I accept of course it´s not up to modern standards it´s from the 70´s or so after all (that´s an estimate from the season 7 point) I really like both of them alot, so I would say maybe start from season 7 like I did, if you don´t like 3rd Doctor so much then skip ahead to season 12 first episode Robot with the introduction of Tom Baker, this is the Doc I´m currently at I have a lot to go to complete it all so maybe someone who have watched more of it or maybe all can suggest a better starting point but that´s my suggestion.

The BBC is one of many companies which broadcast in the UK, however the BBC is publicly funded, everyone who watches live TV, (online or on the box) has to buy a TV licence, which pays for the BBC.
There are 6 BBC channels, but BBC 1 &amp; BBC 2 are considered the main ones and made up 2 of the 5 pre digital TV channels.
(The other channel BBC channels are BBC 3 for comedy, BBC 4 for documentaries, CBBC for childrens TV and CBeebies for young children)

All these channels do not have any adverts on (apart for OTHER BBC TV shows) and shows shown on the BBC do not have and break within, example: the olympic opening ceremony was shows from start to finish without any advert breaks, the same cannot be said for the paralympics, which was shown on channel 4, which has adverts.
What more, the BBC doesn't simply not advertise, it CANNOT advertise.  It is against the rules to advertise on the BBC so if a certain product is mentioned on the BBC, someone has to point out that ""other products are available"".

I noticed the bike wasn't parked outside where I normally park it, kind of assumed I must have parked it somewhere else. Eventually got the motivation to wander up the road but I couldn't see it. I thought about reporting it to the police but didn't bother since I knew my insurance was out of date by a week and thought I just get into trouble. I even remember hearing someone revving the nuts out of a bike in the early hours of the morning the day it went missing, and thinking, I really should look out of the window and see if it's mine, but I just couldn't be bothered. 

Having read ^ I can see it's not a coherent account, but eventing was a bit of a mess at the time, definitely mentally malfunctioning a bit. In hindsight I guess I must have sounded pretty guilty.

If there was no belief that we were doing something wrong, we would never try to fix it.  Whether you take it as motivation or getting hurt is dependent on if you actually think logically.

The best part about you is that you seem to think yourself higher than those type of people.  The fact you create a little hierarchy makes me laugh because you're putting down anyone who has ever said something negative and holding yourself above their standards despite insulting the majority of the population of the planet.  Face it, you simply have a big ego.  You can't deal with the fact that someone doesn't like something of yours, so you're putting blame on the nature of other people rather accepting that you made a bad drawing that deserves critique.",0,1348764234,null,0,false,0,c6e8sp7,t3_10jzdt,t1_c6e8sp7,t1_c6e8iwj,null,1430005371,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I was actually hoping for someone with better knowledge of this Chibnall guy to come along--I only know the barest minimum about him as a writer, and formed many of my opinions based on what I've seen this season and in The Hungry Earth's 2-parter.

I'm always ready for more Who but, like I said, I was truly disappointed in the presentation in 7x02 and 7x04. Chibnall is no doubt an excellent writer of printed work, and while Hungry Earth was not a favorite of mine, it was still very good and was up to Who standards. A big part of what I perceive as the problem is how well Chibnall encompasses his intended story within the ~45min airtime he has to work with on a single episode. Personal taste in storytelling aside, he seems to be better suited to two-part episodes given the pace at which his single-episode stories move. Bringing in personal opinion again: there is no way *anyone* could've salvaged Po3 without making it a 2-parter. But, it aired anyhow and all we can hope for at this point is some explanations in six months or so when they air the next new set of episodes.

The mistakes I see could be made by any writer. The fact that they were made by the same writer twice, and that I am not the biggest fan of his single-episode writing style, and that both the episodes I'm essentially attacking were single episodes by this guy compound into a heap of disappointment and *(especially after having planned to introduce people to Who with Po3, but then being glad they had to cancel)* resentful judgement and a desire for answers.

I turned to Reddit hoping to be proved wrong, to see some good about Chibnall.

To see the origin story of the Daleks, the first Doctor story is 'The Daleks' but fortunately the origin is also retold in the Tom Baker story 'The Genesis of the Daleks'.

One of the best Cyberman episodes is the second Doctor story 'Tomb of the Cyberman', great story, yeah a bit hokey and black and white but still a lot of fun!

One of my favorite all time stories is the second Doctor episode and his last 'The War Games' an 8 parter if I remember, but again a very engrosing story and it introduces the Time Lords.

It's true, they usually are my preferred writers of Who, but I'd like to see a new guy shine. Whithouse, while not a new writer, has had quite a few good ones. I like his traditional sci-fi approach, and the 'Space-Western' is an old classic that was due on Who.

Granted, by the very nature of it being involved in a Western, the basic writing of Who had to be bent to give it the more Western vibe *(I'm talking about pacing and pattern more than anything here...slow build to sudden action to slightly quicker build to big fight to tough resolution)*. I'm not a big Western person, so perhaps that's part of why I judged aTCM a bit harshly. It was simply not my taste, though it was well written and shows great ability on Whithouse's part to write not only outside the expected sci-fi genre, but to accurately encompass the proper pacing and pattern of Western-genre writing. He did well, I just simply am not a fan of Westerns. Also, as ever, the voiceover was cheesy. There's no way around that, though. Voiceover=cheese.

If he accepts the charge, he'll sit out Arsenal (A), Norwich, Spurs (A) and United in the league. First game he'd be available for would be United at home in the League Cup. Note he'd be able to play against Nordsjaelland and Donetsk in the CL over this time.

If he appeals, he'll play probably a couple of games but potentially miss out against Spurs (A), United in the league and League Cup, Swansea City (A) and possibly Liverpool (H) if appealing yields an extended suspension.

I think since he hasn't trained for Arsenal at all, he should just sit the games out. Missing out on Spurs and United are big games, but he'll be in the CL midweek, and so the rest given to our CBs could even translate into a stronger performance overall.

When I say mum, it's really my adopted mother. Technically speaking I was orphaned at 11. My biological mum died when I was 6 and eventually my Dad remarried a year or so later. Unfortunately he died as well and basically his dying wish was for my step mum to adopt my sister and I.

So she did. We did not always have the best relationship and she was a widowed single mum of 4 kids. She did a hell of a lot for me and has always supported me through everything.

She is pretty Christian and quite the conservative. She's not an idiot but I would not call her worldly as such. But she means well.

I'm not quite sure why I'm writing this rambling post really but I guess it's to try and justify why I lie. For me it's very much a white lie. Me going to church once a year to make her a little happier when she's had such a hard life really does not bother me. It makes her a little happier that I do it, which makes me happier. Other than Christmas, religion rarely comes up, the only time I might have to tell her is when I get married because I won't want to do it in a church with a minister.

They've got a second home which they spend, on average, every other weekend in. When they're there they tend to eat out twice over a three day weekend, in locally owned and run restaurants, they pay council tax there, they shop at two or three locally owned shops (the farm shop, the local village newsagent/convenience story, the deli in the village 20mins down the road), they spend money at the sailing club, the golf club, to the ship builder who looks after and maintains their boat (it's a sailing dingy, not a yacht!) over the winter. They pay a local cleaning company to clean the house every week, they pay a couple of local gardeners to maintain the garden and build anything in the garden that they've thought of (like installing rabbit proof fencing around the vegetable patch, and pouring the concrete base for the shed). A few years after they bought it when they decided to redo the inside of the house they paid a local architect and local builders to do the work.

Sure, they are also depleting the housing stock in the area, but given the local economy I would hardly be surprised to find that the amount they're they're introducing into the local economy each year is greater than most people who live there fulltime.

Not saying I'm totally right about this, but it's true you can pick up on things just from a split second in a person's facial expression. I kid you not, when I saw the ""Doctor's Daughter"" episode, it was so obvious that David Tennant had a thing for the girl playing his daughter that I looked it up--and yes, sure enough, they were romantically involved and are now married with a kid. I've seen the same thing with Matt, and more often and more strongly with men than with women. 

I'm embarrassed I'm even speculating about this, as I consider it fairly low brow to discuss in public a famous person's love life. But I guess I needed to get this off my chest and see if there is a single, solitary other person out there who's with me on this. I know a lot of people want to get all upset and say you can't judge a book by its cover and you can't make generalizations about gay people, but I'd rather focus on how amazing it is that the human face can communicate emotions so subtly. I love those fleeting moments when you can read a person's face, before they begin to consciously control it again.

true,ProtoKun7,smith,Smith,"Some of my suggestions will already have been mentioned (*An Unearthly Child*, *The Tomb of the Cybermen*, *The War Games*, for instance). In addition, probably quite a few, but it might depend on how much time you have.

Season 12, for instance, is the Fourth Doctor's first season, and every story in it directly follows the last. They are separate stories, but they tie in in some ways (the first episode of *The Sontaran Experiment* shows the Doctor, Sarah and Harry transmatting to a planet at the start, which has no context unless you watch the last episode of *The Ark in Space*), so if you have the opportunity, you could power through that entire season as one long event.

Other than that, regeneration stories interest me (as it shows relatively fatal circumstances not present in other stories), maybe primary enemies, like Dalek stories, Cyberman stories, and so forth.

*Genesis of the Daleks* sets out a lot of Kaled backstory, so that's a must.

*The Deadly Assassin* is another recommendation because it takes place entirely on Gallifrey, is the only classic story with no companion, and it shows you a lot of Time Lord culture. (It's also the first to start with a narration, which is interesting.)

Stories like *The Three Doctors*, *The Five Doctors* and *The Two Doctors* are also worth a watch, simply for the crossovers between incarnations.

*Spearhead from Space* in Season 7 is the first story in colour; the start of the Third Doctor, and also the first story I ever remember watching.

If you like, there's also the *Trial of a Time Lord* which takes place throughout season 23. It might interest you.

It's hard to really narrow down the list...but I will also add the 1996 movie. The writing isn't terrific:

* [ignore the comment that](#s ""The Doctor is half-human"") because it's not true

true,kibbe,tennant,Tennant,"American here, if I may offer some insight for how my boyfriend and I got into Doctor Who and why I think other Americans are catching on. 

As many people have noted, Netflix and the accessibility of the earlier shows is crucial. As the internet has continued to make the world a more unified place, the same phenomena where you tell your friends about something into started spreading more worldwide. For us, it took my boyfriend's brother telling us to check out the show this show that was recommended to him by a co-worker. Word of mouth + the internet is definitely a very important factor. 

It should also be noted that for us it timed almost perfectly that as we got caught up we only had to torrent a few episodes of season 6 because Doctor Who started airing on BBC America last year. Make it easier for us to stick to a show that hadn't been airing in our country? Yes please! Also, I'm not sure if it ran this way in the UK, but in the US the shows opened with a cutesy summary of what the current show was about. As annoying as the mini-summary was, I could see it being a way to entice someone to stick around at the end of whatever airs before DW on BBCA. (side note: We've since moved and changed cable providers and don't get BBCA anymore so we are back to torrenting so I'm not sure if this mini-summary thing still happens because it's not in the episodes that we've downloaded - is it still airing?)

Additionally, it probably also doesn't hurt that Karen, Arthur, and Matt are all really attractive + hip-looking 20somethings. Again, something more approachable for a mainstream audience. Don't get me wrong, David Tennant makes my heart race and all of his companions are all attractive people, but there's a ""coolness"" factor in Amy &amp; Rory coupled with the Doctor that I don't think was there in the past. (I also didn't start watching the show until last year, so for all I know if I had been following along all this time I might have thought Rose, Martha, Donna, etc were considered ""cool"" during their airtimes as well). Jenna-Louise Coleman fits this attractive/cool kid pattern as well.

Used to go regularly in my early teens for a while (methodist) and was actually an extremely devout Christian, but non-church-goer for a few years in my mid-late teens. Think obsessive bible reader, praying for an hour every day...

Gave it all up when I became an atheist at about 18. Was reading about the philosophy of science, Carl Popper &amp; that sort of thing. This was causing me some anxiety because I thought it was a sin to even consider the possibility that the world was not as described in the bible; however I could recognise that there was a clear qualitative difference in methods of explanation, and that this could be explored using logic and argument. I almost went mad trying to square circles at this point...

After much hand-wringing I told myself that God would forgive me one day of ""free thought"" where I could think about epistemology for myself, unconstrained. Have been an atheist ever since. No regrets, at all.

I don't have the slightest problem with religious people in 99.9% of contexts, but I do regard religious modes of thought as being traps - not deliberately designed or malevolent traps, but dangerous nonetheless.

I have a more jaded view of churches, however, because of various different (maybe unrelated) aspects, many of which have cropped up elsewhere in the thread: the power structures and control; the sexism and homophobia; the mind control; the indoctrination of children; the oppression of devout people by the notion of sin and culpability... I could go on, but, ironically perhaps one of my main beefs is the sheer *hypocrisy* of many, many churchgoers who are not actually believers, but seeking schools, or on their way to a wedding reception etc.

true,hobbesoxon,null,null,"Firstly, and most importantly, you need to separate undergraduate from graduate student admissions: the former is very competitive, involving interviews and (in many subjects) aptitude tests / examinations; the latter is a single application form + statement of proposed research.  Noting that you're thinking about a DPhil, then you already don't have to worry about the ""Oxford interview"".

For graduate entry (DPhil, etc.) you just have to 

(i) meet the entry standards (see university web-page);
(ii) have a research proposal that a supervisor will accept; and
(iii) provide evidence of suitable funding.

Therefore, you don't really have to consider your first point: making sure that you ""stand out"" from applications of other international students, if you already have (i)-(iii) covered.

Typically, funding is the problem.  The person at St. Hugh's was both right and wrong: there are funding opportunities, but they are extremely competitive, and they vary considerably between colleges.  As an American you could, for example, be thinking about the Rhodes Scholarships - these are a battle unto themselves, but one which I heartily recommend to you, because ""Rhodies"" have a great time once they're here, and enjoy plenty of support from the centralised Rhodes administration (which has a plush building to which all Rhodes scholars are invited for dinners, receptions, etc.).

Otherwise, getting funding for a DPhil is an art unto itself.  You didn't specify your subject, but I'm really only qualified to reply in detail about the sciences: here, each science Department will probably have a set of funding scholarships that it can give out each year (many of which are for ""UK or EU"" students, but some of which are often for ""international"" students).  Depending on the Department, these scholarships may be assigned to important researchers in the Department to hand out as they see fit, or they may be competitively awarded.

The other avenue for funding is to get funded by an on-going research project, for which funding exists, and where you would slot into a team heading towards some pre-defined research goal.

In both of the two cases above (Department-specific scholarships / studentships, and project-based studentships), you can get more information by writing to potential supervisors and starting a dialogue.

Writing to potential supervisors is a great way to satisfy (ii) in the list above, because some of us are happy to read applicants' research proposals, and offer comments that might be helpful to improve them.

Starting up a conversation with supervisors is also a good way of getting to know if their research is really something that you could commit to for the next 3-4 years of your life.

A new option that is opening up in some Departments (particularly in science) are the Centres for Doctoral Training: these are cohorts of 10-15 studentships (some of which are for international students), where you undertake one year of taught courses (at a semi-MSc level), before proceeding on to the regular 3-year DPhil.  This is nice, because you get well-versed in relevant techniques in the year of taught courses, allowing you to ""hit the ground running"" when you start your doctoral research, and also because you get to ""try before you buy"", and undertake a few small research projects (mini-DPhils) with research groups that you think you might like to join for your full DPhil.  A quick Google-search will reveal the names and contact details of these ""Centres for Doctoral Training"" (CDT) or ""Doctoral Training Centres (DTC).  There are around half-a-dozen or so scattered around the university, and each has a different ""theme"".  Our local one, for example, is geared towards healthcare technologies.

US-based entry requirements are usually available from www.ox.ac.uk, under ""entry requirements"".

true,nighthawk454,null,null,"I don't think it uses up their 'time energy', thus rendering them unable to time travel. 

Rather, I believe what they said is that the angels send you into the past, and feed off of your 'potential' energy. As in, all the time you would have had left. 

See, from a present day perspective, you are alive, then immediately either dead or near death. This leaves the angels all of the years you would have had.

But, from YOUR perspective, you move from the present to the past, and then live your life in the past. 

So, from your perspective you still get to live a whole life, but from a present day perspective you are living, and then suddenly ***have lived*** because all the time you spent living in the past has already happened in the present day. 

This is what the Doctor means by ""The only psychopaths in the universe to kill you nicely, ... they let you live to death"". Because when an angel touches you, you kind of both die immediately/soon **and** live to death.

Like on the show Friends, they almost all have jobs most of the time, but any scene anyone can really remember they're at someone's apartment or drinking coffee together. No one gets to do that all the time as a grown-up, but the show is called Friends so they show the parts of their days where they all get to interact. 

Not many people would watch a show of Matthew Perry typing out a memo or grabbing a buffalo chicken roller from the 7-11 for forty minutes. We want to see them share their days and play off of each other and make fun of one another.

That's why everyone who continues to step foot in the TARDIS looks like almost as much of a maniac as the Doctor - you want to say ""Did you not pay attention to the fact that you almost die every time you hang out?""

That's because we miss the other forty times nobody is endangered and they just went to the Planet of Unending Ice Cream.

Funerals have mostly been at crematoriums though only a couple were overtly religious. I've also attended two humanist funerals in the last couple of years.

Just to give more info: I have never been to a church of my own volition to 'worship' or similar (nor have I actively worshipped when there, as I've never believed in a god of any kind), though I was forced to go as part of being in the cubs/scouts. I have also been known to sit in the pub and write my christmas cards (not hypocritical, I assure you) while my friends go to carol services and do sing-a-long-a-baby-Jesus songs.

I have no friends who go to church regularly or at all, actually, save for the aforementioned fuzzy christmas stuff. The only relatives I can think of who go are my step-aunt and maybe a great aunt or two. I have a pretty large family too.

I reckon Clegg bet big on the AV referendum because he thought it'd get through. The version of alternative vote that was offered wasn't perfect, but it categorically was (would have been) more democratic and more representative. 

I reckon Clegg saw that more people than ever had voted for his party - the public were seeing that *voting for a change* had, for the first time ever, *made a change* - and he thought the electorate would go for AV. He didn't count on the smear campaign against it and the public buying into that.

Clegg saw this compromise as an investment in AV - AV would mean that votes for the Lib Dems would have more weight in future elections, and thus they'd have more power to fix anything else in the future. 

Clegg probably thought that Cameron was offering him a good deal when Cameron agreed to the AV referendum - he probably thought it was very ""fair"", to use a word the pair of them misuse all the time. That Cameron was treating him to a big concession, because AV was sure to go through, and that would be against the Tories interests. He probably thought the pair of them were changing the face of British politics (to a ""more fair"" one).

I installed the app like anyone else, then registered an old number I had when I was back on Orange.

Suddenly I'm an Orange user and the app will generate codes for me, worked great.

Wasn't rocket science in retrospect, but blew people's minds at the time. The best time was when an Orange sales rep was using Orange Wednesdays to try and sell me a handset (we were in the Orange store as a friend was shopping for a new phone). I whipped out my O2 handset, fired up the app, showed it and said nah, I was good thanks. I did wind up explaining to them how I did it because the staff expressions were hilarious and they were genuinely curious.

I hear what you are saying but personally, I think there's fundamentally (excuse the pun) a difference between what we see within western cultures and in the Islamic world.

You mention the fundamentalist Christians in the USA as an example. I agree that they provide a rich conversation point for comparison. It's not possible to talk about Christians as a collective and the same is true of Muslims.

Where I have to diverge is that, IMO, it is intellectually negligent to consider Christian wackos in the states as bigger problem as Muslim wackos in the UK.

You suggest that lazy policing is to blame. I can't say you are wrong. I do think though that it's likely that the 'victim culture' perpetuated by political elites has influenced the response of the police directly or indirectly.

I know this sounds like a conspiracy, I don't mean it to. You must have surely noticed though that compared to the 80s, racism is up there with paedophilia and Islam has become inextricably linked with race, for no good reason.

Perhaps it was laziness, perhaps it was unconscious, perhaps it was conscious...

Where I'd direct your attention though is to the countries that have Islamic governments and the quality of life for women who live there.

Sure, in the UK there are men who want to take advantage of female children. This simply cannot be compared to nations/cultures/religions that enforce the wearing of burkhas and restrict the rights of women to education and even *driving a car*.

I appreciate there's a gradient. Not all countries are like Saudi Arabia. However if you listen to radio channels like One Umah you'll see that these views are debated rather than dismissed out of hand.

It's real.

There are lots of people in the UK who have outrageously backward views on life.

*Personal opinion*: this seemed like a slickly managed appearance. I would not be surprised if the audience, like many shows with audiences, were told when to clap - though the remark about political ads seemed to garner a genuine response.

As for what Cameron said, well, he's a PR man himself. The three answers that weren't in doublespeak and felt honest were: his party shamelessly exploited the Olympics to lure in business, that he is not very popular, and that his cat is shite at catching mice. 

As for respecting political traditions, well, even though it hasn't been around forever I think we're all quite fond of the NHS in this country, so hands off. 

It was disingenuous to suggest that this economic mess was solely inherited from the Labour party (though I am no fan of them or the Lib Dems either). Nice to know he's capable of lying to the American public about, apparently, fixing the financial trouble the UK is in as well.

The talk about his party being more 'left' than the Dems or Republicans was quite funny. Especially when he talked about gun control instead of the more obvious gay marriage.

Physics - beg your teachers for ExamPro. It's a program which has every single exam question inside.  Good news is the exams for AQA Physics are straight forward...the ISAs are quite tricky though. Anyway here are my tips.

You want to do every single summary question in the Nelson Thornes book as you go along, then you want to do the end of unit exam questions (message me if you want the answers). Keep doing this as you progress through the year. Do this and you'll be okay. When you break up for xmas you want to spend those 2/3 weeks doing nothing but exam questions. This is what ExamPro is for, just do every exam question for one topic and move onto the other. It took me about 2/3 solid hours to do 10/12 pages of exam questions for one topic etc then move onto the other. That's a rough idea...if you have nothing to do the night before the exam then you'll be fine. That's when you know you've done everything. Unit 1 physics is easy. Unit 2 is tricky but okay if you're good at Maths. Unit 4 (A2) is good with practise, and unit  5 is easy too. 

Edexcel Maths...the exam questions are the same every year. You'll never open a paper up and think OMG WTF DO I DO KNOW. No they're very predictable, you'll get the odd oh fuck oh fuck question but it's okay. Just make sure you do every since exam question in the book, do the end of chapter questions/review questions (again message me if you need the solution banks). Work through the Solomon papers and then move onto the Edexcel exam papers from about 2000/2005.

Security guard comes steaming out and says that I've not paid. Already rather angry by the utter idiots pissing about at the self service, I just said ""Whatever"", and closed the window. This, unsurprisingly, displeased him.

He opened the door of the car (doors don't automatically lock until the car is moving about 10mph, I think). Sigh. Tell him to have the pizza back. Drive off. Get more angry because I know I'm right. Drive back and tell them to check their logs. They do. Point out that I was driving a rather expensive car, was well dressed and had about 200 quid in cash in my wallet. 
They come back and confirm that I had actually paid, as I said I had all along. I say that I expect a full apology from:

Security guard

Head of security

Store manager

Yes they could but it would have been a minority government.

&gt;More unfair taxes

Personal allowance has gone up, they introduced a bank levy, increased capital gains and the top level stamp duty.  They gave a tax break to SMEs.  They funded a council tax freeze that most people got.  That's not them leaving the rich alone.  ""More tax breaks that only benefit the wealthy"" is simply not true.  There has been house building, they have funded more housing programmes building on what Labour started.  They've actually helped create and bring jobs to the UK, they're putting capital up front for a Green Investment bank and look what they're doing with the UK Space Agency.  General Motors has reaffirmed its connection with the UK plant in Ellesmere Port and we've just had the largest quarterly rise in the number of jobs in 2 years.  They held a referendum on political and electoral reform.

The picture's not quite as monochromatic as what you seem to be making it.

So it can be a state where a guy pretends to be just a friend while hoping that a girl will ""change her mind"", but it can also be a point in time where one person kills the potential for a romantic relationship. For example, ""I thought she was into me, but then she pulled back when I tried to kiss her again and said she just wanted to be friends. I told her to call me if she ever changed her mind and bailed."" In this example, the guy got friendzoned but didn't languish ""in the friend zone"".

But you are right about the unrequited attraction. If you see a cute girl and ask her out and she says ""no, but I'd like to be friends"", then that's not friendzoned. That's just a rejection.

So you get statements like ""in any period of 24 hours a detainee must be allowed a continuous period of at least 8 hours for rest, free from questioning, travel or any interruption in connection with the investigation concerned."", interviews are supposed to be broken for meals at appropriate times, ""meal breaks should normally last at least 45 minutes and shorter breaks after two hours (of continuous interviewing) should last at least 15 minutes. If the interviewer delays a break in accordance with paragraph 12.8 and prolongs the interview, a longer break should be provided."" and so on.

This echoes how I've always felt about Spurs, especially in recent years. We've gone leaps and bounds over the past half a decade but we're still very much a work in progress! We shouldn't just be aiming for a stable Champions League spot we should be aiming for success as well!

Last season we were one of the stronger teams in the Europa League (Until Manchester flopped in the Champions League) and for sure we were the strongest in the FA Cup come the later stages.

I was cheering us on in both competitions! Thinking this would be our year! We could possibly win two major competitions! A European trophy and our countries biggest Domestic Cup.

But Redknapp... Facking Redknapp... Didn't take the Europa League seriously enough and didn't rotate nearly enough for the FA Cup and League, causing us to lose a ten point lead and lose out on 3rd place by just one win... **ONE** win...

When we hired AvB I was over the moon! an ambitious young manager who is not only capable of winning trophies, but winning several, and keeping consistency in the league! If there's anyone that can lift us higher than Bill Nicholson ever did it's AvB.

You can get a pretty decent one for £500-£600 and it will probably be in a not too shabby condition. Sure, its not the most fashionable car, but it does the job. I drive from Shropshire to Sheffield almost on a weekly basis to see my girlfriend, and it will use about 2/3 to 3/4 of a tank of petrol to get me there AND back. Cost a max of £40 to fill up. road tax was about £130.

If you can find one that is serviced, and has a recent MOT, I would consider it! Happy car hunting!

Doesn't know any specific details about it. Gives cops loads of incorrect information. Basically guessing based on his dream as he was never there. Mentions it was his friends idea. Both get charged with murder.

Not just a false confession but a real wtf on the part of the justice system (in the US) too.

The things is, virtually every guy I've seen claiming to be friend zoned has been either only interested in bedding the girl, or hovering around trying to stay close in the hopes that they turn around and suddenly love them. The first case are the usual run-of-the-mill jerks who then use every chance they can to bitch about her, the second case are those who are as Shagoosty said, too immature to handle the rejection.

If you ask out a friend you love and she rejects you, either you stay friends and you let go of those feelings to move on, or if you're unable to do that, move away from your friend until you sort out your feelings and can resume as just friends. No it's not easy, yes it will hurt, but all the girl, or guy as it can happen in the reverse did, was reject you. The only person keeping you in the friend zone and in constant suffering/longing/whatever is yourself. That's why I say it's a state of mind people put themselves in, hoping things will change in their favor instead of any state of relationship.

&gt; A friendzone isn't a state of relationship, it's a state of mind some guys put themselves in to justify what happened and befriend a girl whose only interest they have in is between their legs.

This ~~implies~~ explicitly states that every guy who foolishly tries to remain friends with a woman while harboring romantic feelings is only interested in her for sex. 

I agree with your second post, but that is *not* what you first said.

And by the way, the state of a relationship is directly dependent on the state of mind of the people involved.

true,yk3313,present,Gianfranco  Zola,"JT is a complete legend for us. He is the greatest leader in our team, and you can see it from the way he carries himself, the way he treats the younger academy lads, the way he knows the club and loves it with all his heart.

Since Abramovich, we have always been semi ""hated"" by the press. With good reason thanks to the Special One and many fans claiming we bought the title. JT has been captain through every manager we have had, and there has to be a reason for that besides so called 'player power'.

Now in football, many think a captain does nothing, but to play in a team where you know your captain is a proper leader on and off the field along with the manager is totally different from playing in a team that has no leader and only listens to the manager.

We won't be choosing a new captain anytime soon, the rest of the squad besides Lampard, Cech and Luiz are still cubs compared the lion that leads us out on the pitch.

And let me make this clear, I do not particularly like Terry, but the man has deserved more from his country. No other player besides Ashley Cole gets as much hate as him. Now you can listen to the average fan and journalists and think Terry is a complete tool, or look further and notice EVERYONE is a complete tool anyway, and Terry is one of the nicest blokes you can ever meet, judging by just how MANY people wanted to testify for him in court.

Capello, Wilkins, Jose, Ash, I think even Sven came out and said JT wasn't racist. People that know the man, know that this is all a big hoohah. Now if you believe what was allegedly said, then Anton said Terry wasn't even racist.

Whatever all this is, John Terry is definitely our captain, leader and a legend and as much bad publicity he brings to the club, thats it, its publicity. And lets be honest here, anybody with half a brain doesn't buy into this nonsense that JT is actually a racist. Just look at who he has played with and anybody who can accuse JT of being a racist is just messing with him, and sadly, the FA think they are above British Law now.

We were playing Norwhich... until then I always referred to them as the giant killers. My memory might be shot to hell after all the substances, but I remember the Canaries beating utd, the loveably never-lived-up-to-his-u21-days Dean Ashton was absolutely tearing utd apart. Anyway, I decided I was pulling for the Canaries... but then, there was this spectacular moment. Jol on the sideline, Spurs daring to do, when I realized that I wasnt going for Norwhich anymore. I can't really describe it. All I can say is I didn't choose Tottenham, Spurs chose me.

Since then my family have become apart of the yid army. We wouldn't change it for the world. My mother, bless her saintly soul, is the epitome of a soccer mom. At first she pulled for Spurs because I did, and she wanted to be a part of my love for the game (example: every team I was on club, highschool, ODP, she was the statistician; she meticulously took notes while at the sane time questioning the eye sight of the refs as well as determining that my opponents were indeed mongoloids... a true fan.) It wasnt until the HR era that she truly understood ole' Bill. To dare is to do. Since then she has been as much of a Spurs fan as I have, even finding nuggets of information I have failed to miss.

Joking aside, it does sound pretty interesting. 

Here's the issue that I have: I assume, the first thing the Doctor did was scan the universe for other TARDISs. Why didn't it find this one? So here's my revision of your story.

I don't like that the humans were ""bred"" there through DNA. I'd say, humans migrated there. Thor and Loki used their Fob Watches to hide from the other Time Lords - like the Master did and the reason why the Doctor didn't find the Tardis in his original scan, is because the TARDIS switched off when they used their Fob Watches? 

Now, two decade ago, Thor opened his Fob Watch, returned to Time Lord status, helped Loki do the same, and over the twenty years they rose to lead the planet. This was the time it took for them to re-activate the Asgard TARDIS and for the Doctor's TARDIS to pick up the signal of the Asgard TARDIS.

[So your whole story fits here (right until the meteor shower)]

Now you start seeing Loki's real face. Like the Master, once he returned to Time Lord all his memories came back, and his real 'character' was revealed. So, Thor would be ""good timelord"" and Loki would be ""bad timelord"". But Loki is a trickster so it takes a hell of a lot of time to realize that Loki is behind all the bad stuff that's happening.

[Here comes the meteor shower - the doctor notices that Loki is causing the havoc, and then pieces the rest of the 'bad stuff' together]

Once they find out Loki is 'the bad guy', your whole Thor dying scene happens, he forgives Loki, and Loki, instead of going the master way and preferring to die, he accepts the help of the Doctor and River. The Doctor cannot let him go free after killing a TimeLord so, as you said, locks him up with River - who spends time teaching him to control his anger.

---

That's what I'd fix. This way you have a more plausible story, a definite bad guy, and something to ""solve"" - just like every other DW episode.

Except adding onto Loki's already troubled mind that he now knows The Doctor was responsible for the Time Lock, and he has him literally standing right across the room and could exact revenge anytime he wanted. It would be a slow, drawn out burn to Loki's sudden eruption of rage and attacking Asgard. Leaving Loki to realize his uncontrollable anger is what causes Thor's death and begging for The Doctor's help when he originally wanted The Doctor's death.

Now living in London I've only had cars now and again here so I have no no-claims discount, but come on, that's fucking ridiculous.

BMW M5 E39 - valued at £8,000 - £4,900 FC

Nissan 300ZX - valued at £1,500 - £3,500 FC

Ford Focus ST - valued at £2,000 - £1,900 FC

Vauxhall Corsa 1.2 - valued at £3,000 - £850 FC

I got quotes in New Zealand for the same cars. Not one of them was over $1,200 (£600) for fully comprehensive coverage. The M5 was even valued at NZ$40,000/£20,000. A standard family car here would be around £150.

Unfortunately, cars are twice the price of what they would be in the UK. Britain does have some very cheap cars, with plenty of good bangers for around £1,000 or even less. A cheap car in NZ would be £2,000 for a total heap. ",0,1348819085,null,0,false,0,c6elhf2,t3_10lwb9,t1_c6elhf2,t3_10lwb9,null,1430011486,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; I get narked that people christen their kids when they have no real religious belief, but to each his own :-/

I'm a non-believer but got married in a church and had both kids christened.  My wife's not particularly religious either (but more so than I) but she wanted the church wedding and christenings.  Not to mention the parent pressure from our respective mothers who are both keen church-goers.

As far as I'm concerned, the whole church business is nonsense and it makes no difference to my marriage or my kids if we stood in a church and chanted a few ""magic spells"" to appease the gods of one particular religion.  Being rather ambivalent to the whole affair myself, but knowing how much it meant to my wife and our respective families, made it an easy choice for me.  I nodded, smiled, said the right words when prompted, and everyone was happy.

I think it's a bit like putting on a stage show for your family and friends.  Just because you don't believe what's written in the script doesn't mean that you can't play along and be part of the entertainment.  The same goes for being in the audience.  All our family and friends turned up to the church services, religious or not, and I'm sure most of them bleated the Lord's prayer along with all the other sheep, even if they didn't really believe it.

On the other hand, I had huge admiration for a gay friend of mine who very respectfully declined the offer to become the godparent of another friend's child.  He explained, both to the parents and the minister of the church, that he was willing to fulfil the traditional role of godparent but felt unable to take an oath in a house of God that did not accept him for what he was.  It wasn't that *he* wasn't willing to enter into a ""contract with God"", but that he didn't feel right doing it when then church was telling him that God wasn't interested in entering into a contract with him.  It would have been easy for him to nod, smile, say the magic words and keep everyone happy.  But he felt (and I totally agree) that this was a principle worth standing up for.

true,TragedyT,tardis,TARDIS,"You didn't offend me at all, it was more that you seemed in your original rant to be losing perspective a little, holding up your own taste and preferences as if they were more than that.  

Anyway, what I meant by your 'wrong' mindset is that you're falling into the classic Who trap of loving the show as it appeared at a certain time, and then negatively comparing it against that template - it isn't really fair, because the show never stands still.  People end up getting more and more out of tilt at the show when they do that, every little thing eventually just starts to grate, until they're only watching the show in order to tut at how crap it has become.

Cliched as it may sound, the key to enjoying the show is to be able to embrace the changes, and let go of the past.  I have a favourite Series already (five).  If they ever manage to surpass it, I'll be delighted beyond words, but if they don't, I'll still always have my favourite season.

Personally, I prefer ongoing season arcs, and would love it to continue in that direction, but this season isn't going to be like that, and I have accepted it, and instead look for the positives in the new style.

My main positive is the way that they're using the standalone episodes to stealth-disguise the fact that the main story is still all about the ongoing evolution of the characters.  I was worried that it'd be like original Star Trek, where the episodes could be shown in any order and not matter, but nope, we've seen an ongoing story throughout.  

Another positive I'm enjoying is the excellent character moments that're whooshed through at breakneck pace - often so quickly that you need to rewatch them to get their significance.  I'm thinking of these first few episodes as ten years of life on fast-forward, with only the occasional focus on the more important scenes.  While others complained about the rush through the Pond's divorce issues, I went back, watched it again, and found myself deeply moved.  Same goes for *Mercy*.  The way Amy talks sanity back into the Doctor in just two lines with minimal drama is so stripped down and yet so effective - and this then follows on as we see the Doctor in subsequent scenes remember the good man he really is once again.  I loved it.

As for Chibnall.  I'm not going to even try to persuade you to enjoy his stuff, seeing as I don't like his writing.  His shows are usually 2 star efforts in my book, and I *hated* his Series 5 stories, so went into these with extremely low expectations.  Perhaps this is why I was less upset than you when both his stories turned out to be unsatisfying and messy.  Instead, I concentrated on enjoying the pile of good things in each of his episodes (Brian Pond is a sweetheart), and not let his considerable pile of bad things ruin them.

I find the times I wish to rewatch The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood to be rare and remote indeed, and I think it may also prove to be the case with his series 7 episodes, but that's the very nature of the show: shambolic genius.

Is deliberately altering my perspective to minimise the flaws giving the show a bit of a free pass?  Is it the critical equivalent of sticking my fingers in my ears and going 'lalalala' over anything unpleasant?  Possibly, from a certain point of view:- but the end result seems to be that I'm still giddy like a schoolboy for the show, and counting down the seconds to each new episode, so I'm chalking that one up as a 'win' for team me.

There is no news here. This story was known, that we competed for Suso's signature with Real Madrid, Barcelona and a bunch of other clubs. That was [3 years ago](http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2010/11/22/2225901/spanish-striker-suso-signs-professional-contract-with):

&gt; The 17-year-old has been a star in the club's academy, with Barcelona and Real Madrid thought to have been interested in the player before the Reds took him under their wing.

Suso still only has 9 months left on his *current* contract. He only signed a 3 year deal when he turned 17, which is unheard of for an academy prospect. The expectation since then has been that he would leave. 

I would like to see Brendan turn that around and get him on a new deal ASAP (we have been putting new deals infront of him for the past 18 months)

Then it will be time to celebrate, otherwise we will end up losing him.

Edit: to add, the state of Suso's deal is a hint at how much of a mess the academy has been. We only resigned our top dozen prospects last July and still have another half-dozen or so better academy prospects, including Suso, who haven't resigned and are running down their deals.

It was *easily* repairable, didn't need a replacement, and the car itself was worth less than £1,000 (*according to some market research I did*). However, despite this, they didn't want to sort it outside insurance. Fine, that's their choice. It's gets sorted, I never hear anything more. 

Anyway, I get my new premium back from my provider last month and it's doubled. DOUBLED. I called them, and it turns out they paid out £1,800 for the full replacement of the bumper, legal fees (?), replacement car and 'other costs'. They could have bought the damn car TWICE for £1,800.

You're supposed to report every accident to them.  My neighbour recently drove into my car and created about £250 of damage.  She paid me in cash.  But my insurance company would rather I report the matter to them, following which my insurance quote would rise because statistically, I'm more of a risk.

My advanced driving qualifications mean nothing to them.  They're simply not interested.  I pay through the nose to run a group 20 car despite the fact that it's worth far less than a brand new group 5 car.  They claim that because it cost £50k new, the quote should reflect that.  If it was written off, they'd pay me no more than about £2k.  So the £1,000 I pay annually (I'm 40 and have a clean licence) makes no sense when I'm a more careful and skilled driver than my neighbour, who runs a little Micra and most likely pays a fraction of what I do.

From Wikipedia on Autumn's etymology:

&gt; The alternative word fall for the season traces its origins to old Germanic languages. The exact derivation is unclear, with the Old English fiæll or feallan and the Old Norse fall all being possible candidates. However, these words all have the meaning ""to fall from a height"" and are clearly derived either from a common root or from each other. The term came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like ""fall of the leaf"" and ""fall of the year"".[10]

Dickens was 19th century, not 18th century.

""To whom am I speaking"" sounds hopelessly anachronistic to my ears, the kind of thing a person who writes into the Telegraph ranting at Americanisms would say.  I have never met any native British English speaker under the age of 30 who says this.

""Gotten"" is so associated with being an Americanism it made its way onto [a recent BBC list](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14201796) of 50 of the country's language pedants' bugbears.

Well I got a letter through the post this morning (less than 24hrs since I told them, the cow at the desk must have red flagged me there and then) saying my case was being reviewed. So that means no dole cash for me next week. I seriously cannot wait to be shot of the cunts.

Here is a nice quote from the man himself:    
&gt; ""I am often dishonest in my techniques, but always honest about my dishonesty. As I say in each show, 'I mix magic, suggestion, psychology, misdirection and showmanship'. I happily admit cheating, as it's all part of the game. I hope some of the fun for the viewer comes from not knowing what's real and what isn't. I am an entertainer first and foremost, and I am careful not to cross any moral line that would take me into manipulating people's real-life decisions or belief systems.""     

Darren Brown does magic, and ""[mentalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentalism)."" Any claims that he does psychological manipulation aren't based in fact nor the science of the same name.

Er....well, if I've heard 'whom' or 'gotten' enough times over the years, and can provide contemporary examples of their use, then 'factally' becomes a bit irrelevant. 'Thus' is another one that was announced as being dead, but the announcer seemed to forget to tell anyone.

Try acknowledging the entire sentence - '...or any of the 'classics' I've read in the past'. I wasn't stating that it's impossible, simply highlighting that I've never seen it used, even in past literature - as a result, I'd be interested to see where it appears.

Maybe it's where I've spent a lot of time talking to people on the phone over the years....but it could just as easily be in person; in short, it's always going to appear puzzling when someone asserts that a word is 'dead' when you hear it often enough to wonder how they arrived at this conclusion.

You are surely the one who is guilty of a knee-jerk reaction?

I am guessing people who are far more qualified than yourself have spent considerable time weighing up the situation and have arrived at what they think is the best solution.

You have read an article on reddit and in a matter of minutes decided that their approach is wrong.

I am no fan of the government and If you had offered an alternative I would be all ears. As it stands, you look like someone who has no real understanding of the problem and no ideas for a better solution but still chooses to question those that do.

We have more debt than any other nation in the world (if you include both private and public as a percentage of GDP), mostly due to bank debt. The easy money of the past 20 years has inflated asset values to unsustainable levels. There are two options to solve this:

1. The asset values fall back to sustainable levels. This is the worst option for the banks (and possibly the world economy?) because they would go bust, given the amount of leverage in the system.

2. The BoE prints money to buy bank assets (gilts, MBS, etc.), keeping them afloat, but causing inflation that impoverishes the rest of us as real wages fall. This is the most likely option.

Seriously though, you're still dressing like a punk, which people can (and do) automatically find frightening - and at this point, your take on it becomes irrelevant. It's you're right to dress in a manner that others might find scary, but it's *not* your right to dictate their opinion (or, up to a point, reaction) - especially when you're aware of the stereotype in advance. As an alternative example, dress all in Nike (including hat), and you'll get treated like a drug dealer - and not much will change that.

Years ago, I got excited and bought a black leather jacket, cowboy boots, bootstraps, silver chains (etc., the whole metal-thing) - and was astonished to discover that, when walking along a high street, people would *automatically* move out of my way, where they never had before. I then realised that I might be jovial, a barrel of fun etc. but a) they didn't know that, and b) they *didn't care* - we judge books by their cover because we don't have time, and while it's your right to dismiss others' opinions as bigoted, etc., that ultimately doesn't change how it affects you, which is a problem if it reduces your options.

Now, you can either use this to your benefit (wear a shirt/ tie, watch how people automatically give you more time), or to your detriment (dress like Swampy, watch how fast you get moved on) - but if you go for something that's potentially scary or intimidating, you do have to put up with it to an extent.

The other insurance company might have to sign-off on the work done, but they can’t simply rack up costs and pass it on to the ‘at-fault’ company to inflate their size of the balance sheet.

2) Implement a minimum speed for whiplash claims. They have this on the continent; we can replicate it. All the relevant research should already be available.

3) Ban referral fees completely; heavy fines from the regulator if anyone is found to be messing about with them. ‘Referral fees’ are nothing more then kickbacks.

4) Ban the selling of private information (anything identifiable such as address, name or phone number) without customer consent *each time* there is a new accident.

5) Ban the police from selling information on accidents to companies. Implement a simple transaction fee for FOI requests.

Don't spend two years tryind to decide if the system is broken; we already know its broken and the solutions have been discussed endlessly. The Association of British Insurers have been talking about this for years without achieving anything.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; According to the website you link, the number of ""long-term"" empty homes (empty for more than six months) is only 279,000. I wouldn't even include houses that have not been empty for less than six months in these figures.

According tone of the PDFs on that website there are about 4,000 people that sleep rough and roughly 90,000 statutory homeless.

&gt;What exactly are you going to advocate? Confiscating properties off people because they are empty awaiting sale, seeking tenants, undergoing renovation, or because the owner has recently passed away? Six months empty is perfectly acceptable.

I'm not advocating any specific changes, I merely pointing out how pathetic it is that we think that there needs to be legislature to protect rich people from these squatters yet we do nothing to tackle the underlying social issues that lead to people being homeless in the first place - economic inequality, a lack of jobs, drugs, rent and ownership being too high, inadequate provisioning of homeless shelters, the level of crime on the streets.

How would you solve the problem of homeless people? Criminalising them when they have the sense to squat over sleeping on the streets where if the weather and rats don't kill them the crime will. The people interviewed in the article even said that they weren't causing a problem. If you were in this situation what would you do? 

Maybe fear of punishment isn't their driving motive and harsher sentences and tougher policing aren't going to solve the issues.

We ignore our social problems and then talk about how sad it is that an owner of an unoccupied London house get squatters.

true,epemberton,yorkshire,People's Republic of South Yorkshire,"BBC in parroting establishment line shock!  I'm as angry as anyone else that the healthcare bill got passed, but this author seems to hold the BBC to unrealistically high standards.  It is a fantastic institution, but one thing it has never done is taken a stance in direct opposition to the government of the day.  

A lot of the issues that he is claiming that the BBC did not report on, which the author claims demonstrates their bias, are pretty lightweight.  The line about
&gt;The University Hospital of North Staffordshire (UNSH) has been criticised after it was discovered it started charging A&amp;E patients for any drugs they needed 

merely refers to the £7.65 prescription charge, which is levied on all drugs across the NHS.  There is an argument as to whether this charge is appropriate, but to link it to the healthcare bill seems tangential at best, seeing as prescription charges have been with us for many years.  This is a policy that would have been made at the PCT level based on their own funding requirements and irrespective of the Healthcare bill.  Colchester Hospital had to do [something similar (.pdf)](http://www.colchesterhospital.nhs.uk/press_releases/pr_140205.pdf)  in 2005, and yet I doubt even Liberalconspiricy.org (the source for the original story) would manage to pin that one on the Tories and the healthcare bill.

There are many other issues which, whilst relevant, I don't think the BBC could have touched without getting into serious political bother.  It is the unfortunate triumph of this PR-based government that they have been able to introduce such devastating and wide reaching reforms whilst all the while remaining 'hands off'.  The speculation about increased private sector influence and commercial capture of the NHS commissioning process was, at the time of the bill, just speculation that ran contrary to the official government line.  It was well founded, of course, and it undoubtedly revealed the primary motivation of the reforms, but the Tories always had an element of plausible deniability.  

Ultimately, I think the BBC would have got into significant hot water had they raised a number of the points that the author cites in his article.  This may be a sign that the BBC needs to grow a backbone and stand up to government, but it is understandable that they don't wish to pick a fight with this Tory government that is just itching for a chance to cut them down to size.

There are a few issues where the author raises some good points (such as the under reporting of political donations and conflicts of interest), but I don't think that these are limited to the BBC and its report of the NHS bill.

As wonderful as the BBC is, it is naive to view it as being an institution that will fight against the government on behalf of the people (as the author claims).  The unfortunate fact is that the government were successful at obfuscating and clouding the realities of the reform and that the population at large simply wasn't sufficiently interested in the implications to take notice.  As the article repeatedly asserts, the information was out there in many other news sources (even citing those bastions of radical agitprop, the Daily Mail and the Telegraph on several occasions), but I fear that the government would have pushed ahead with the reforms regardless of the level of opposition that they felt.

The BBC is a fantastic institution that greatly improves the cultural landscape in this country, a fantastic source of impartial journalism around the world and an excellent counterweight to the corporate media.  But we need to understand that if we wish to challenge the establishment then we will not take them with us, as it is ultimately the establishment to which they are beholden.",0,1348838104,null,0,false,0,c6enbzw,t3_10m37r,t1_c6enbzw,t3_10m37r,null,1430012357,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11
