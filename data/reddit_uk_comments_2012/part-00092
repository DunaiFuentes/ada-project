 I don't think he or anyone who likes him is a ""bad person"" nor should anyone take personal offense to someone not liking what they like. We all like different things. We can all like the same thing generally (ie doctor who) and like / dislike different things within it (ie doctors / companions). That should never be taken as a personal offense.

1. Stop banging on about your book you media whore

2. What are you talking about liberal mobs for? These were apolitical, disenfranchised opportunists

3. You can smash your American mobs, we're going to cure our social ills. When you have a broken leg, you don't break it even more.

4. &gt;Have ancestors in England going back hundreds of years: so we'd expect immigrants to form 'mobs', of course. You goose-necked bat.

5. This isn't a race thing, this isn't a political thing, this isn't about paying people not to work. This is a lack of outlets for our inner-city youths, this is a lack of jobs, education, prospects, life. But why would there be jobs? Jobs cost rich people money, and that's all that matters: the rich get rich, and fuck the poor. You utter bint.

6. We eat, we screw, we drink. We're animals, apparently. Well, now you can just go fuck yourself because you're wilfully ignoring all the culture, art, sport, music, film, theatre, writing, just the incredible life we're creating. You know we have free museums, Ms Coulter? You know we can just wonder into a national museum for completely free and revel in world-class culture? How the hell can you call us animals without either ignoring or being ignorant.

7. &gt;You can do a lot of things you couldn't do there 30 years ago: What, like get married to someone you love, regardless of their gender? Like marry someone of any race? Like practice any religion you want without being labelled a terrorist? I'm sorry we're not all living in the middle ages like you, Bill

8. Tottentam? Seriously? Pathetic. Bilt O'Reilty.

9. Stop saying native Englishmen, you sound like even more of an idiot.

10. Giving people money isn't why we have high young pregnancies, young sexuality and the glamorisation of sex is what's driving that. Which I for one firmly blame on American culture

11. We're Nazis? When the fuck did this happen?

12. STOP SAYING SMASH THE MOB. When a window breaks, you don't tear down the wall. You fix the window. We're fixing our bloody windows.

* An inquest returns a verdict of 'death by unlawful killing'.

It was a huge form of escapism for me during the last school year. Of course, I was originally drawn to the show because of the complex nature (like I said, series 6). I know the first season is lacking in production values, although the Ninth Doctor is great. The relationship between the Doctor and companion with series 1-4 (especially Rose and Martha) are a little different than you will see in series 5&amp;6, which is, at its heart, about the Doctor being an imaginary friend/father figure, rather than love interest, so it was his relationship with Amy that really had me emotionally invested. It's also a great amount of fun. It all started back in 1963 with a cranky old man, his granddaughter, and two schoolteachers. The show is basically an anthology, with many stories for many Doctors.

But on a more specific logic, the re-booted series of Doctor Who really doesn't start getting energetic, and well, addictive until about the middle of Season 2. This happened with me as well. I didn't really get the show at all. But as I kept watching, I started to understand more, and become more addicted to the 'Greatest Show in the Galaxy.' 



I'll give you a little backstory of the Classic series, starting from 1963. Okay, so basically the Doctor is a 900-ish year old time traveller from the planet Gallifrey. All the people of Gallifrey, the Time Lords, were sent into a war against the Daleks (The Doctor's most hated enemy), called the 'Time War'. The Doctor, to his last hope, was obligated to destroy all the Daleks AND Time Lords, so there would be no more fighting. He was the only Time Lord left. Ever. In the universe. Until he met The Master, another Time Lord that somehow survived. The Master turned on him though, and now is the Doctor's archenemy. But, in later seasons, the master disappeared, and was thought dead. Also, all Time Lords have this one thing, that when they die, they can 'regenerate' all their cells to become a new person, but keep the same mind and memories. This process is called regeneration. The Doctor you're watching is on his 9th regeneration. So that's basically all you need to know.   



I absolutely love the show. Definitely my favorite since I was a child. It's basically every single genre of a story put into one. SiFi, Adventure,  Romance, Comedy, Drama, Horror, you name it! I love it because it teaches moral lessons through every genre possible, and the Doctor is just a wonderful character. The behavior of a 7-year old, but a mind of the universe. It teaches that we shall look at things with wonder, instead of fear. It teaches us that everyone is important to the universe in some way. It teaches us that we might not be the only ones here.

&gt;Adelaide: [Backs away from the Doctor, unsure of what is going on] You should have left us there. 

&gt;The Doctor: Adelaide, I've done this sort of thing before. In small ways, saved some little people. But never someone as important as you. Ooh, I'm good! 

&gt;The Doctor: Little people? What, like Mia and Yuri? Who decides they're so unimportant? You? 

&gt;The Doctor: For a long time now, I thought I was just a survivor, but I'm not. I'm the winner. That's who I am. A Time Lord victorious. 

&gt;Adelaide: And there's no one to stop you? 

&gt;The Doctor: No. 

&gt;Adelaide: [Noticeably angry] This is wrong, Doctor! I don't care who you are! The Time Lord victorious is wrong! 

&gt;The Doctor: That's for me to decide. Now, you'd better get home. Oh, it's all locked up. You've been away. Still, that's easy... 
[uses the Sonic Screwdriver to unlock and open the door to Adelaide's house, then puts the Sonic Screwdriver away] 

&gt;The Doctor: All yours. 

&gt;Adelaide: Is there nothing you can't do? 

&gt;The Doctor: Not anymore. 

&gt;Adelaide: [Walks inside the house, takes out her gun, shuts the door, and kills herself] 

&gt;The Doctor: [Turns back to the TARDIS, but takes a look back right after Adelaide kills herself. Shocked, he realizes the full effect of what he has done. He has changed the future. Adelaide Brooke died on Earth, rather than Mars as she was supposed to. There are two survivors around to tell her story] 

&gt;Adelaide: [Echo, in the Doctor's mind] I don't care who you are! The Time Lord victorious is wrong! 

&gt;The Doctor: [Sees Ood Sigma] I've gone too far! Is this it? My death? Is it time?

First we'd need to encounter hyper inflation and a large percentage of the population would need to feel the negative effects of such actions, e.g. not being able to feed them selves adequately or have very bad living conditions. Also this would have to directly effect the middle classes most, rather then the poorer classes in society. 

I see the actions of the current government as divide and conquer on many levels, one of them indeed being between young and old. But the older generation are feeling the pinch just as hard, look how difficult it is for an average person that's 50+ to find a reasonable job, where large amount of ageism does exist. It's sickening.

true,DoctorsGurl95,tennant,Tennant,"I can kind of answer, but keep in mind, only the writers and producers really know the actual answers to these questions.

1. No, the drumming in The Master's head is not some sort of PTSD. When the Master looked into the Untempered Schism at the age of 8, like all Time Lords must do, the Schism spoke to him, I guess, or something along those lines. Essentially, the Master kind of become a slave, and the 4-beat drumming in his head is almost like a subconcsious instruction, telling him what to do. At least, that's how I understand it.

2. The whole world thinkng ""Doctor"" all at the same time is significant because what the Master did was he basically removed all of the Doctor's power from him, removed any influence he had ever had on people. Martha spreading the word and getting people to think ""Doctor"" all at the same time renewed peoples' faith and belief in him, restoring power to him, returning him tohis former state.

3. No one really knows the answer to this, except the writers, and as Matt pointed out at ComiCon, that is their life as actors, Steven Moffat knowing the answer to something that everybody knows, having the power to withold that information, and then smiling and laughing at them. We do have to remember, however, that Jack is from the 51st Century, and grew up on the Boeshane Peninsula, and was the first person from that area to be accepted into the Time Agency, and the people back home called him the Face of Boe, as in the Face of the Boeshane Peninsula. We also have to remember that Rose made Jack immortal back on Satellite 5, meaning he can't die. Whether or not he can age remains a mystery to us. Personally, I think Jack is the Face of Boe, otherwise, how would he know about YANA???

Most of this was conjecture, or insight I've gotten from reading and watching interviews, and watching episodes over and over again, and getting more of Jack's backstory from watching Torchwood, but hopefully it's helped.

No, it is absolutely key IMO that Squirtle stays home for this season and hopefully for the long term.

Really? [Here is a list](http://www.e-n.org.uk/evangelical-churches/) of all the fundamentalist Evangelical churches in the UK; well over 100.

While the [number of UK church goers](http://www.whychurch.org.uk/trends.php) is in decline (and that's according to the Christians themselves), the number of fundamentalists and hard-line creationists as a proportion of the remaining believers is [increasing](http://leavingfundamentalism.wordpress.com/2012/04/23/uk-fundamentalists/). We're effectively trading large numbers of passive, barely-practicing Christians for a smaller number of hard-line aggressive vocal fundamentalists.

It's true that it will be illegal for the schools to teach creationism in science lessons, but that doesn't mean that the staff can't and won't put a sway on what they believe the 'truth' to be. I'd speculate that, in independent christian schools, RS will be presented as important and factual as English or Math, and the biology and physics taught may be down-played or doubted. Do you really want teachers who don't believe in evolution and the natural creation of the universe teaching the same?

It's certainly not as pronounced as in the 'States, but we certainly have our fair share of fundamentalists and religious controversies. Just the other day, the Catholic church showed up on the BBC morning news protesting gay marriage in Scotland claiming that it was 'forced on the population'.

We can't simply ignore these issues simply because another country has it worse. Sure, the thread might be better suited for /r/atheism, but if anyone can do anything about it, it's us Brits, not the global community.

Firstly - I thought the timing was extremely ill-judged. Showing this a mere year later, and during the same time of year, appeared to possibly influence young people into doing the same thing again. Why? Because when partakers in the violence told ""their story"" it was often without remorse. So it could appear the BBC were actively encouraging civil unrest again.

Secondly - it seemed grossly insensitive to cast the rioters as ""victims"" - poor harassed children by police that were ""asking for it"". This seemed extremely disgusting in the wake of the real victims of this terrible situation. Some people lost their homes. They lost their livelihoods. And a broad public lost confidence in the safety of their town and bore the brunt of expensive damage.

The only saving grace about the timing was that it was pouring with rain across the whole country at the time the first documentary aired. But who isn't to say it might have been a mini-heatwave during the 2nd or 3rd screenings?

He tricked my mother into the event horizon of a collapsing galaxy, to be imprisoned there... forever. He still visits my sister, once a year, every year. I wonder if one day he might forgive her... but there she is. Can you see? He trapped her inside a mirror. Every mirror.

If someone's already decided to watch the show, then watching everything in order and seeing Blink when it comes is a good idea.

It may also include public actions such as *repeated threats*, sexual remarks, pejorative labels (i.e., hate speech) or defamatory false accusations), ganging up on a victim by making the person the subject of ridicule in online forums, *hacking* into or vandalizing sites about a person, and *posting false statements as fact aimed a discrediting or humiliating* a targeted person (e.g. accusations of sexual offences). Cyberbullying could be limited to posting rumors about a person on the internet with the intention of bringing about hatred in others' minds or convincing others to dislike or participate in online denigration of a target.

 I haven't seen all the classic Who stuff, but *I don't mind being spoiled on things that came out 20+ years ago*. I would not think to tag anything from the ninth or tenth doctors as spoilers. I would also feel a little uncomfortable going back two seasons as a general rule - however...

What if, to satisfy those who want a more retro-protective spoiler policy, the rule for spoiler tagging included all episodes with the current companion(s)? This would cover their major storylines. And if a companion was new, the rule would still apply for the previous companion(s) until one year had passed from the switchover.

First off, you're forgetting the golden rule of writing. The thing that you're taught the very first time you pick up a pencil and are told to write a story, all the way through any course that teaches creative writing. The golden rule is to know your audience. Writing and reading is an experience between the reader and the writer, and anything you write is rubbish if you cannot connect with the people you are meant to be writing for.

With that said, I'm not saying how it was presented was perfect, but Moffat does deserve some slack for the position he was in. He was certainly attempting to write with his audience in mind, but the story he told was a very hard one, with all things considered.

That being said, I think the issue you bring up with the episode seems to be confusing the story Moffat wanted to tell versus the story you wanted to see. There is a distinct difference here, and it should be important not to confuse the two. The idea behind the episode wasn't to tell the story of how heart wrenching it was to have your child taken from you. That story had already been told with A Good Man Goes to war. This story was to see the transformation of Mels into River. To see how the little girl whose entire life goal was to kill The Doctor turns into the mysterious sassy flirt we've come to know and love. To see the very moment she fell in love with The Doctor, and I think it told this story well.

We are able to very clearly see Mel be this immature troublemaker, running around stealing people's clothes, and only caring about herself, and then the transformation into the person she wants to be. My favorite part is when The Doctor is dragging himself to the TARDIS in an attempt to save Amy and Rory, and River is absolutely amazed. ""Look at you. You still care, don't you?"" It's the first time in her life she sees someone care so much for someone that isn't themselves, as she has only cared about herself.

Soon she finds herself risking her life to save Amy and Rory, and she's not entirely sure why. It's a strange feeling to her, and you can tell by Alex's acting when she's in the TARDIS flying it. Then with the revelation that the 'River' person of which The Doctor has such a fondness for, she realizes the good person The Doctor sees in her, and it's enough to make her sacrifice her entire regeneration cycle just to save him. To be selfless like she saw him be.

*That's* the story that was told. That's the story that Moffat wanted to tell. It might not have been the story you wanted him to tell, but I don't think it's hardly fair to judge him based on your own projections into the episode.",0,1342773197,null,0,false,0,c5gpj63,t3_wt72u,t1_c5gpj63,t1_c5gctuv,null,1429423123,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

You have to be able to afford the ticket and the correct dress to go to the Opera.  No exceptions are made.

But public schools get no direct subsidy and fee paying parents can't write off those fees or get the tax back in any way.

The department of education gives them exactly nothing, though the Department for Culture Media and Sport shovels money hand over fist at the Operas.

The point is this. Merit. Any given job should be handed out on merit, I fully agree. I don't want a bad black actor in the place of a good white or Asian one. That's stupid.

But lets look at the evidence. Clearly the wailing and shouting in the comments there are saying these actors just simply are not good enough, that's why they don't get the jobs. Yet these same said actors then fly half way across the globe to a more populous nation, where they're now competing for jobs with vastly more black actors as well as vastly more actors in total, and suddenly they have no problem finding work. It's almost as if the suggestion they're not good enough wasn't at all accurate!

Two year later he's in a Hollywood blockbuster, and then again...as if my magic, he is now *suddenly* ""good enough"" for a staring role in BBC drama Hustle.

I'd say Idris' role in Ultraviolet 5 years before The Wire demonstrates the UK's ability to spot his ability, and you'd be hard pressed to demonstrate Noel Clarke is being held back by some inability to spot  talent.

You can't argue racism, because for every Idris, you'll find a Dominic West who didn't have much of a career before The Wire, struggling actors find breaks where they can.

Arguably black actors have more advantages - any colour could have played McNulty (See Freeman's portrayal of ""Red"" in Shawshank for example) , but only a black man could have played Stringer Bell. We are long past the days where Othello was the only part allowed to be played by someone black.

More TV &amp; film is made in the USA, so there are more opportunities.

But most actors in the UK struggle for work. Lennie James has had a solid career compared with about 99% of actors in Britain.  You complained Lennie James wasn't very active before getting his US break, but he was, he was doing far better than most actors out there.

And you can't just ignore Shaun Parkes and Noel Clarke. If the UK is rubbish at spotting talent, and giving black actors juicy roles, then you have to explain Parkes and Clarke's careers.

I think black actors are badly served in roles and writing in certain genres - soaps such as Eastenders for example.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_New_York

&gt;New York is one of the strictest states in the nation with regards to the purchase, possession and carrying of handguns.

You need to get a license from the NYPD to buy a gun, in comparison to many other states where you go to a store and buy a gun like you buy a can of coke. They have strict rules about carrying guns for protection, as opposed to other states where you can carry whatever you like for whatever reason you like.

This is actually a prime example of gun laws not working at all, at least for America. To say that guns are responsible for their high murder rate is totally unfounded. New York is a huge city with massive slum areas, massive disparity between rich and poor, blatant segregation (i.e. one street is 99% black people and is a shit hole, the next street is 99% white people and much nicer). Plus warring gangs, massive drug problems, general hatred and mis-trust of the police etc etc.

To make a fair like-for-like comparison, instead of a cheap karma-train-riding comment, you'd need to compare different US states with similar demographics but different gun laws. You can't just compare NYC to the UK and say ""lol guns are bad""",0,1342781466,null,0,false,0,c5gqgfr,t3_wt58x,t1_c5gqgfr,t1_c5gdoon,null,1429423551,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

What is a class statement if not political? Class and politics are directly linked, the behaviour of the government has direct effect on all or specific classes.

Political can be a statement of unhappiness of the system you reside in, this includes attacking aspects of society which are seeing far more benefits in normal life compared to others, which in the riots was demonstrated hugely.

It is not all about left wing or right wing, that is just a grouping of political ideologies. 

Saying people are not political is a very dangerous way of isolating people from society, since you're saying their points are not valid, which is very similar to Cameron's statement of its just pure criminality, which is complete nonsense. Criminality is a consequence, its not a root cause.

It doesn't if you are routinely connecting to these services without TOR. It does if you routinely connect to these services with TOR.

&gt;Not to mention the metric fuckton of useless crap flying around Microsoft networks, NetBIOS, WINS, NetBEUI, there is no reason to encrypt this or even have it running in the first place.

Hence TAILS.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IsmqG4CSiQ&amp;feature=related

Many people will say he passes sideways and isn't actually very creative but a crucial part of maintaining possession and developing phases of play in this philosophy. You must be able to hold onto possession in areas where you can hurt the opposition, something Allen with his control and patient passing allows us to do. 

He reminds me of a less refined (and less majestic) but more combative version of Iniesta. He has good pace and is excellent at winning the ball in the oppositions half and driving into space. Swansea weren't actually that prolific last season so he isn't quite a creative powerhouse like Iniesta but he is a key reason why Swansea were able to keep so many clean sheets and if you win possession in dangerous areas, like Allen does (see the video where he wins the ball off Shelvey and suddenly you see why hard pressing on the ball is desired so much), you create chances.

You are cheated out of all that was promised in that previous episode ""A Good Man Goes To War"", it's all just bloody dropped in order to do a hasty 10 minute introduction and transformation and redemption of Mels into River.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"This is difficult to pick apart, but I'll wade into the mire (!) This is going to sound controversial, but stick with me. I'd say acting is somewhat unique in that it is not purely about merit, it's also about reflecting a society back to itself. That doesn't mean some caricature of 'black roles' and 'white roles', but some parts inevitably do require a particular skin colour. To take the example of Idris Elba and The Wire, he was playing a role of someone who grew up in a particular area of inner city Baltimore, and was childhood friends with Avon Barksdale, and various other drug dealers. The choice of who gets this role is not colour-blind, because a major purpose of the drama is to describe and explain racial politics in America. Similarly, the role of the black mayor, or his white challenger, or the white, cultural-Polish trade union chief. 

The Wire is an extreme case, and in most cases skin colour is not anywhere near such an important factor, but there is a sliding scale of importance. On the one hand, dramas which are about racial politics, or set in time periods where race was a major issue, on the other hand, individual, abstract or, say, mythological dramas. So, for instance, it would be really odd to have a character who was black in 1950s America, or 1970s Britain, without mentioning race. To some degree it would be deeply disrespectful; imagine someone watching who had lived through being racially mistreated at a particular place or time, and he watched a drama set in that place and time, where everyone was harmonious, and it wasn't an issue. It would be like an airbrushing. 

Or if you don't talk about individual roles, when you're casting a group of people, you can't do a TV drama set in Brixton or Lewisham where everyone is white, no matter how talented the actors, and you can't do a drama set in rural Buckinghamshire where everyone is black. On the other hand I don't think, in general, race matters for Shakespeare, because even the histories are massively fictionalized, and they are not about the reality of historical situations, but about universal human truths. Likewise Dickens, which is so over-dramatized. In general I'd expect the percentage of actors of different skin colour to be vaguely around the percentage that they make up the population (albeit very vaguely). And I think this will decline as an issue as the ethnic minority populations continue to move out of the cities, and continue to marry other Britons of other skin colours, and alongside, as the politics of race (hopefully) continue to improve, and the issue ceases to be relevant in the real world.

So if you accept that, America is a bigger country, with a much higher percentage of black people in the population (according to wikipedia, there are 39 million black people in the USA, and 1.2 million in the UK), arguably with more serious race issues, demanding more drama written about it, and of course Hollywood is a massive honeypot regardless, then it is not surprising that a lot of talented black British actors are going to go over there and take those opportunities.

*Subs from: Gulacsi, Ward, Johnson, Agger, Robinson, Jose Enrique, Wilson, Sama, Smith, Wisdom, Adam, Lucas, Shelvey, Spearing, McLaughlin, Eccleston, Suso, Ibe, Morgan*




First of all, surely Robinson should play left back instead of Flanno? I'd also like to see Sterling and Eccleston play at the same time since both have apparently looked very sharp in training. Eccleston is a strange one, I'm pretty sure we were close to releasing him a few months back. Hopefully the reports are true that he's been sharp.



Interesting lineup though. Aqua, Cole and Pacheco have a lot to prove.

true,Kalontas,tardis,TARDIS,"That famous limit comes from the Fourth Doctor serial ""The Deadly Assassin"". In it, we find out the Master is making a plot on Gallifrey because he lost his final life and wants to regenerate in the Eye of Harmony (which was on Gallifrey back then). Its intention was to give motivation to the Master, coincidentally giving the Time Lords one of the most remembered and most crucial backstory details. Ever since it stuck with us that this is the number of lives a Time Lord has.

However, not only have Time Lords been resurrected and gained a new set of lives, back then Doctor was on his 4th life. The writers of that serials were *not* expecting the show to live for so long so that limit becomes crucial.

Now that we're actually getting there, it would be a good idea to bring the limit to attention to suck it dry for drama potential (""it's my last life, no more chances for me""), and then fix it somehow - he gets resurrected, some cosmic being grants him new regenerations... or he just regenerates for no apparent reason. Perhaps one of his many not-deaths during the new series refreshed his set. Or perhaps we never get explanation and it just didn't work.

I do think Mikel will be first choice holding mid. He's just gotten very good at it. He isn't 2007 Essien, but nor is 2012 Essien. Lampard will play beside him.

The next three is tricky, but I actually think we will see it be Marin, Hazard, and Mata. I see this operating with Mata theoretically on the outside but pinched in a bit, and Hazard higher than him, attempting to find space in between the lines. I think Ramires will be a super-effective sub, coming on with huge amounts of energy and zip when the opposition is tired.

Seems to me that investing in manned fighters as unmanned drones are coming online is very naive. Like investing in battleships and dreadnoughts in the 30's as carriers and subs came online. When WW3 hits and country X send 10,000 cheap/expendable UAVs for every manned fighter, the F35, Eurofighter or Rafale will all prove useless.

The idea is that Hazard plays between the opposition back four and midfield, while the width of the two wingers keeps them deep and stretched. The midfield three (Mikel, Lampard, Mata) aim to find Hazard in that space between the lines, where he attacks the back four. If the other team responds by pushing a central defender up to Hazard, one of the wingers drifts inside and becomes a striker. This is all coupled with high pressure and fast ball movement.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGZ9Oq5XXVE

I agree that Henderson would have played better in a system he is more suited to but Allen is tailor-made for this system, the close control, short bursts of acceleration, patience in possession. We don't have a midfielder who can carry the ball like him.

Also, I disagree about everyone being able to press. If it was that simple everybody would be doing it and it wouldn't be something we talk about or associate with Barca or Spain, the best teams in the world. It's pressing at the right time, instigating moves and keeping possession under pressure. 

I think there is more to his game that we will see when he steps up to a bigger club. I don't think I can emphasise enough how important it is to be able to keep possession and move the ball forward in this system. Watch highlights of the FA Cup final first half. We played, roughly, a 4-3-3 and Henderson / Spearing struggled immensely to get the ball forward and move through the 2nd / 3rd phase of possession.

true,Bronzewik_Albion,lfc68,,"I agree with you, in a sense. I think there was definitely a higher expectation last season, given the amount of money spent and the form we finished the previous season with. 

I think John Henry was definitely displeased with the results, and may have thought that necessary to sack him. But, how do you think everyone would've reacted to that? The fans would say that he had more league points, a trophy, and was a bad half of football away from winning the FA Cup. That, on top of what he had achieved as a player, was enough to keep the wolves from the door. 

I just think the Suarez affair was the straw that broke the camel's back. It was an out for Henry. He could now say ""this club doesn't tolerate this certain behaviour"" (which is funny, cos I don't see him urgently trying to sell Suarez). 

That being said, I don't blame Dalglish for the signings. Comolli was installed as ""Director of Football"". I don't know if that meant he was fully in control of signings, but he definitely played a part. The Carroll, Downing and Henderson signings reeked of his philosophy; paying double for homegrown talent.

‎""Evidence from previous Olympic host cities suggest cashing in on the Games is no easy task.
 
In Greece, even before the current economic crisis, Athens struggled to pay off its £9.4bn splurge on the 2004 Olympics. The country was crippled by debt and its venues lay abandoned.
 
Atlanta 1996's legacy, while positive in regenerating the city's downtown area, has been marred by transport issues that blighted the Games.
 
Beijing did not see an immediate surge in hotel bookings despite hopes that hosting the 2008 Olympics would open China up to a wider tourist market.
 
Barcelona 1992 has been heralded for transforming the coastal city into one of Europe's most popular tourist destinations, but even its tourism trade suffered in the aftermath of the Olympics.""

‎""It has long been a staple of the economics profession that large sporting events do not, or at least very rarely do, make money for the places that host them. This is true of just about the entire economics profession and all economic reports: except those written by economists to provide an economic justification for the holding of a large sporting event."" 

http://www.forbes.com/​sites/timworstall/2012/06/​05/​the-olympics-will-lose-lond​on-tourism-money/
 
""The boom to the economy that the Government hoped the Games would bring to the capital appears to become a bust with tens of thousands to tourists spurning the hiked prices, congestion and heightened security.
 While bookings for July and August are down by 35 per cent on last year other European capitals appear to be prospering from London’s gloom.
 French ministers, who lost the Olympic bid to Britain, might be quietly rubbing their hands with glee not only for dodging the £10 billion Games bill but also with a 50 per cent rise in tourism bookings. Similarly Barcelona and Berlin have seen their tourist numbers soar by 100 per cent over the summer.""

1. I think he's accidentally right. The new owners care more about PR and 'brand expansion' than anything else, in my humble opinion. They've swapped a man who is prickly with the media and disliked by them for someone who constantly talks to Sky Sports and Talksport (and this is coming from a fan who is as in love with Brendan's apparent intellect and pleasing mannerisms as the rest of you).

""Negrito"" in the most rudimentary translation simply means ""little black man."" Even if he did say it 8 times (which only happened in Evra's version of events) any ""racist"" connotations are remote at best. However, in the FA's book even making reference to someone's race is a apparently considered racist language, therefore the conviction. How can you claim to support the club and not even know these basic facts about the case? So the next time you feel like slandering one of our players maybe **you** should question your allegiance to the club. 

As for the Terry case, I don't think you have the faintest idea of what ""concrete evidence"" is, considering that almost everything used against Terry was conjecture at best, and out and out slander at worst, since the unreliability of lipreading, the only evidence against him, was noted in the court's ruling.

true,ledaniel,null,null,"I think, more than ""slide into insanity,"" the Doctor is regressing somewhat. I recently rewatched The Doctor's Daughter, and, despite the weird way the companions (and even the Doctor, telling Donna how he had a daughter and everything) act in that episode, it's fairly revealing of the Doctor's wartime past. I think it clearly shows that he wasn't always this nice guy that helped people and saved planets which is displayed in Tennant's Doctor.

Smith's Doctor has much more of this 'warlike' personality that the tenth doctor talks about in that episode, and, honestly, with all the shit Tennant's Doctor had to take in the fourth season it sort of makes sense. 

It feels like Tennant's doctor was around exploring to see the beauty of the world and was ready to perceive it. That's why he appreciated everyone, why he resented destroying the robots in Girl in the Fireplace,  and so forth. Smith's doctor doesn't want to see beauty, he wants to find it. He wants to find a reason to live. He's sick of knowing what he knows, thinking what he thinks. 

We see Smith's doctor break down from his ""insanity,"" or, really, his personality, I would call it, when he doesn't know. A beautiful episode to point this out is Amy's Choice, where he sees the Dream Lord. He loses his contempt and, for example, begs the old people/aliens to let him help them because he doesn't know what the crap is going on (in this scene, he acts quite a bit like the tenth). At the end, we see that he's not insane, but that he hates himself.

I'm terrible with accents so Canton never bothered me. There's probably at least *one* person in the US who has an accent that sounds fake or hokey or ridiculous that is actually American. Just like there will always be one person in every country who just happens to fit all the stereotypes given to that country.

I haven't noticed any have/has issues or anything. I'm pretty sure that if Canton needed to say it, he'd say ""flashlight"" or ""aluminum"" (with one ""i"").",0,1342811731,null,0,false,0,c5gx72r,t3_wvy9d,t1_c5gx72r,t3_wvy9d,null,1429426782,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

true,ax4of9,null,null,"Stories still go to the front because people continue to post them. The mods can't stop them from posting just because there is a general transfer speculation thread. 

The idea of the transfer thread was to consolidate discussion in one place. It's not about downvoting or hiding other threads, its about trying to prevent fracturing of the discussion. I think yesterday, there were 2 self-posts talking about Carroll, posted within 7 minutes of each other. The earlier one was more popular and had about 17+ comments, but the one posted later still had about 5 or 6 comments. If there was ONE main thread, the discussion would have been smoother, but like I said, we can't stop people from posting. 

In my original suggestion to the mods, I asked them to create ONE main account for posting transfer threads and giving everyone the password. That way, anyone could update the transfer threads with their links etc. The suggestion was not taken up. 

Lastly, posts come on to the front page very fast due to the algorithm that Reddit uses and the low traffic that we have. The top 50 posts sorted under ""hot"" have only 4 posts with more than 30 upvotes, and another 11 posts that have between 20-30 upvotes. That's a whopping 36 posts on the front page that have less than 20 upvotes, which means either the content here is pathetic, or the upvotes are very much skewed. 1 is a post on Rodgers' interest in Dempsey, 1 is about Lucas' recovery, 1 is a picture of some of the players with a Victoria Secret employee and 1 is a bash on SAF. It shows that most links on transfer speculation are not necessarily popular and only make it to the front page due to how Reddit skews early upvotes.

taxes, that's how most of the games are paid.
&gt;So the same thing as when the Queen had her jubilee then ...

correct, i don't like that either :O
&gt;They take most of the year off, what does another 3 weeks matter ?

it matters because they are unaccountable and are paid for by taking our money through taxation. they are a government sponsored monopoly that can only get away with taking so much time off because they are untouchable, a bit of competition and accountability would get their asses in gear :)

&gt;That's why they are sponsors ... they PAY for the games to happen in return for exclusive advertising rights ... how exactly do you tax someone who is paying you ?

 exclusive advertising rights doesn't negate paying a fair tax - this is another government sponsored monopoly, an unfair advantage that can only be achieved through government force and loss of rights to everyone else!  

&gt;Why would a shop in London want to advertise the games ? Don't you already know about them ? Again, doublespeak, what you really mean is shops aren't allowed to profit from tacky copies of genuine merchandise.

a shop could make a profit from advertising the games :) also, no one has the right to take someone else's rights. IP law is based, yet again, on government monopoly - the use of force to take rights and freedom and give them to a preferred government backed choice. that is not how a free-market should work. stefan kinsella has some very good writings on this :)

And claiming that the FA doesn't act without concrete evidence is simply laughable. The whole Evra case was built on he said she said with no concrete evidence whatsoever.

And if next year EBJT was accused of racism I would expect a punishment similar to suarez's ban, as that is the precedent that was set. However it's clear that wouldn't happen because Terry was already cleared of charges this year despite ""concrete"" video evidence.

A lot of people were dismissing Aidy as a player with pace and not much else, but I'm very happy to see that we're **finally** getting a young, promising player - whose name is not Tom Lees - to put pen to paper on a long-term deal. It would have been typical of the lack of ambition under the Bates regime if we'd let him go, although I hasten to add that I think it's only due to White's strong feelings for Leeds that he didn't bugger off as soon as his contract expired. (A refreshing attitude, in modern-day football.)

I genuinely hope that he'll be taking the left-back slot sooner or later (I know that he won't be doing so unless Drury retires or is injured long-term), because I thought that his positioning was generally good last season - and he looks better when he can see the game unfolding in front of him. However, he still made some naive mistakes and his throw-ins are awful as ever, so I can see why Warnock is reluctant to include him in his defence.

Still, that means we're looking at White on one wing and Snoddy on the other, at best, when I was hoping we'd have another, more exciting option ahead of White.",0,1342817123,null,0,false,0,c5gymwt,t3_ww12t,t1_c5gymwt,t3_ww12t,null,1429427472,3,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,3

So I'll just post the thoughts:

A lot of people were dismissing Aidy as a player with pace and not much else, but I'm very happy to see that we're finally getting a young, promising player - whose name is not Tom Lees - to put pen to paper on a long-term deal. It would have been typical of the lack of ambition under the Bates regime if we'd let him go, although I hasten to add that I think it's only due to White's strong feelings for Leeds that he didn't bugger off as soon as his contract expired. (A refreshing attitude, in modern-day football.)

I genuinely hope that he'll be taking the left-back slot sooner or later (I know that he won't be doing so unless Drury retires or is injured long-term), because I thought that his positioning was generally good last season - and he looks better when he can see the game unfolding in front of him. However, he still made some naive mistakes and his throw-ins are awful as ever, so I can see why Warnock is reluctant to include him in his defence.

Still, that means we're looking at White on one wing and Snoddy on the other, at best, when I was hoping we'd have another, more exciting option ahead of White.

All of these things together mean that even our poorest are a damn sight better off than the American poor.

America's worst fear is the guy robbing them at gunpoint or breaking into their home and slaying their whole family. These are things that rarely happen in the UK because even our thieves are not at that desperate level of poverty.

What was an eye opener was watching journalists trying to get to the bottom of the rioting last year talking to kids who in their minds were victims of poverty, all dressed in Nike trainers and Adidas hoodies organising their next raid on Blackberries. Poverty!

So that's the climate in the UK. Our most violent seem to mostly keep the worst of their violence within gangs. Kids stabbing other kids. Drug gangs shooting other gangs. There's the odd mugging at knife point, but the hassle of stabbing you for your iPhone just isn't worth it it seems.

But America, well it's too late. You can't take the legal guns from the regular people because their poor *are* that desperate and they all have illegal guns. 

But that means some of the regular people who are just plain crazy get legal access to firearms and things like today's shooting happen. In the UK, you get the mother losing it and killing her kids, or the dad losing it and killing his wife. You get the teen losing it and killing himself.

true,Ch13fWiggum,eng-Herefordshire,Herefordshire,"I think the point of Concealed Carry laws isn't that you throw more guns at the problem (you do, but that's not why it's effective, although whether it's effective or not is a case for discussion)

With concealed carry laws, it means that anybody could have a gun on them at any one time, so if you go out to commit a crime there is a chance you might run up against somebody like the video of the internet cafe. The deterrent isn't that there will be a gun in play, but rather that the criminal can't say for sure that there isn't somebody armed at their chosen crime venue.

It's like Lo-Jacking -IIRC in the book Freakonomics there is the story of a city's police force giving GPS trackers to car owners to hide in their cars. Now the intended benefit was that the police would be able to recover the cars quicker and arrest the people that stole them. However, because car thieves were unable to tell which cars had trackers and which ones didn't, it reduced car crime across the board  - the only definite way to avoid getting arrested for stealing a tracked car, was to not steal any cars.

Concealed carry *theoretically* works in the same way, Say there are 5 people walking down the street with one gun owner and a group of muggers, assuming that the muggers would avoid a gun owner at all costs. In an open carry situation the muggers can identify the gun owner and rob one of the others safely. In a concealed carry state the muggers wouldn't be able to identify the gun owner, and would be less likely to mug the 4 non-gun holders. The individual benefit of owning a gun (i.e. it prevents the gun owner from being mugged) is reduced, but the total group benefit increases.

Don't get me wrong, I'd not like them to appear over here (after if there isn't a legal handgun at all the muggers wouldn't need one themselves), but there are theoretical benefits to a system, compared to open carry.",0,1342823591,null,0,false,0,c5gzzd3,t3_wvuqc,t1_c5gzzd3,t1_c5gz3ik,null,1429428110,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

&gt;create a co-operative and sell milk direct to public

easier said than done, many years ago we had the Milk Marketing Board which used to dicatate the price of milk and set quota limits, however when some bright spark decided to get rid of this system. This caused Dairy Crest to be formed which was basically a huge monopoly, made worse by the purchase of unigate (the only real other competitor). Now fine you say but how does that prevent the farmers going into business for themselves? Well try and negotiate contracts with other businesses when you have pricks like this who can ALWAYS out bid you.

I notice you say about organic milk, well zaladruid, if you think that is helping farmers you are sorely mistaken, at BEST it allows for 4-6ppl over the conventional price to go to the farmer [organic is a con](http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/07/09/2011/128884/Dairy-Event-2011-Tough-times-for-organic-milk.htm)

more info [Milk prices from dairyco](http://www.fwi.co.uk/gr/milkpricestable.pdf) 

You tell the farmers to do something about it, but feed wheat (which is the main indicator for cost of production of all feedstuffs for livestock) has massively increased [Top right graph](http://www.fwi.co.uk/gr/graphs.pdf) and yet the price farmers have recieved for said livestock and livestock products have not increased in proportion (see livestock stats). Another issue is this many farmers are tied to contracts which make it very difficult or a massive legal issue, if they declare how much they get paid by a buyer per litre of milk, this has basically made it impossible/very very difficult for farmers to bring the issue to the public eye.

&gt; Adebayor contributes a large amount of his own money to charity initiatives and he is trying to help organise improvements to educational standards in his Togo. He is investigating ways to fund the building of schools in villages many miles from the capital, Lome.

&gt; “A lot of people would love to be in my position so whatever it takes to help, I will do it,” he added. “I have the chance to build a school in one of the poorer villages where people are struggling.

&gt; “There is a lack of facilities for secondary education. There aren’t computers, some of the teachers aren’t so good, so it’s a tough one. I can’t do everything but whatever we footballers can do to help our continent, we have to do it.

&gt; “We are lucky to be where we are today so I have to remember that.”

In [this interview](http://vimeo.com/42818229#) he talks about donating one of his houses to 20 orphans.

Shall we all pay a tax to pay for Fox news and their channels how about everyone pays an extra tax for sky and another for virgin? ...Why not?

&gt;Of course it would. What did you think ""publicly funded"" meant?

So anything that has been publicly funded can never be privately funded. OK i didn't know that's what that meant, thanks for explaining,  i just thought they could find other avenues of income like the rest of the channels that people think are worth paying for


&gt; If you're watching live TV, then pay for the license. Don't be a tight arse. 

i am watching it and i do pay,  if you read above i said my dad doesn't pay (we don't live together) and it's not about being a tight arse as i mentioned, it's the principle.  Lots of people didn't pay poll tax but they still voted, i guess they are just tight arses and it was nothing to do with the principle

&gt;If you honestly can't afford it, which you almost definitely can

Lot's of people have t.v that can't come up with an endless weekly payment even of a couple of quid,  that's why you see people in shops buying their family cheap £1-£2 meals for a family of four.  It's not much to you, it is to others who don't have spare money to give away 

&gt;but that does not give you the right to not pay if you are using the service.

actually you supposedly pay the tax for any/all live t.v broadcast whether it's bbc or not yet (you can't just say i don't watch bbc and not have to pay) it only seems to really benefit the bbc,  so if you already pay for a service like sky then you have to pay twice with the tv tax ...just because,  also you can't get all live t.v from the UK available online


&gt;You're just lowering yourself to thier level

Being the bigger person by allowing yourself to be walked over, taxed and threatened by assholes is not helping yourself or anyone else

true,ColdHotCool,derbyshire,Edinburgh,"I think you're mostly right.

Because the USA has so lax gun control laws you're not diminishing the probability of a crime, only increasing the probability of the criminals having guns.  

If a criminal thinks ""Well, the police have guns, the citizens have guns and I can't tell who does or does't, don't I too need a gun?""  

That then raises the question of ""Well if they have a gun, it's a handgun, I need a Uzi or rapid fire gun"".

Essentially the criminal wants to stack as much in his favour as possible, it's not the thought that others having guns that put him off, it's if his gun is big enough, (because determined criminals are usually desperate, not thinking straight, or determined enough to go through with it).


It also encourages the criminal to ""Shoot First"" because there is nothing more frightening than a Uzi going off to freeze you.  Even if you're a gun totting citizen you freeze, because A, He has a bigger gun than you.  B, He's used it once, and has demonstrated he has no problems using it.

true,Alphaiv,null,null,"&gt;When I read gun control debates raging back and forth on Reddit a prominent argument is, ""Well if we get rid of gun ownership that is a tyrannical policy that discriminates against a large group of people"" - suggesting that in a post-gun-control U.S. people who had previously owned guns would be morose for the rest of their lives; slipping into depression and despair at their loss of liberty.

This is like the textbook definition of a strawman. I doubt anyone seriously believes that all gun owners would slip into depression and despair for the rest of their lives if their guns were taken.

&gt;Where are the people raging against the lack of gun availability in the UK?

Unfortunately the media, particularly the tabloids, have been demonising and scaremongering about guns for a long time and, as well as making very strict gun-control laws the default position for people to take, it also creates an environment pretty hostile to anyone that advocates US-style gun laws.

I know that people often make fun of Americans and characterise pro second amendment advocates as a bunch of paranoid gun nuts who are obsessed with revolution and fighting a tyrannical government but personally im in agreement with them. For some reason people seem to think that after WW2 tyranny is something you read about in history books or on the news in 3rd world countries, that its not something that could possibly happen in Britain because we know what tyranny looks like and as long as we don't vote for parties that look like fascists then we're safe. 

I mean I don't think for a second that Cameron or Miliband want to restrict our freedom unnecessarily or that legislation designed to restrict access to guns or prevent terrorism or fight online crime is enacted with sinister ulterior motives but if someone ever does decide that something akin to tyranny is in our best interests (""No one does evil knowingly or willingly"") then the road has been paved for them.",0,1342829228,null,0,false,0,c5h162s,t3_wvuqc,t1_c5h162s,t3_wvuqc,null,1429428662,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Take one look at the transfer thread and tell me that it looks like anything approaching a cohesive conversation. Comments about individual players are scattered and unless someone wants to dedicate every minute to updating it, it may not reflect the conversation of the day. I appreciate the efforts that you and SF have put forth, but it's flawed by design. At least with individual threads, you can make sense of what is being discussed.

If I click on a thread about Joe Allen, I don't want to see it interspersed with comments about Andy Carroll and Clint Dempsey. I want to read about Joe Allen. I find this far more tedious than having duplicate threads covering the same topic.

I heartily agree with your comments about the nature of the reddit voting system, but my reply to all of that is, ""so what?"" *Every* post makes the front page in this subreddit, whether popular or not, but *not at the expense of more ""relevant"" posts.* If the argument was that worthwhile content was being lost amid the shit, I would see your point, but as it stands, that isn't the case.

edit: if you genuinely can't understand this, consider players as a commodity or a resource valued by their transfer fee.

Kenny as much as I love him had a bad policy in the transfer market.... he made some bad decisions, you're right. In fairness to Kenny, he had to work with the Calibre of players that wanted to come to us. We didn't have Champs League football then and we were a long way off a top 4 finish. Andy Carroll didn't even want to come to us, he was forced out by the owner for 35 million quid! When you think about it, landing Suarez was an excellent aquisition by KK.

BR has taken up a role with a club that have a history of success but are now just scraping in to the Europa League and finished 8th last year. **BIG NAME ""EUROPEAN ELITE"" SIGNINGS WILL NOT WANT TO SIGN FOR US!** I wish more Liverpool fans would learn this.

I agree though that I'm unsure about the signing of Dempsey as he is 30 now and maybe last season was his peak? Saying that though, remember when we signed Gary McCallister? (Probably not) Even Steven Gerrard said he was like ""wtf is this an OAP home?"" then he had to eat his hat when he scored that screamer against Everton. McCallister turned out to be a decent signing for us at his ripe old age, so I'm not about to pass judgement on him just because of his age. Dempsey has been banging in Goals for Fulham and the USA national team for a long time and if he can keep doing that, then what does age matter?

I'm not sure about Joe Allen, could this be Jordan Henderson 2.0? I haven't seen much of Joe Allen play, but I've heard a lot of British Media hype about him, so clearly my immediate reaction is to say he's overrated. I won't say anything until I've seen him play though. For the rumoured 15+ Million price tag, surely we could have gotten a foreigner of the same standard for a lot less than that? What I'd like to know is what are our scouts doing? How can Newcastle pick up these gems for buttons, and we pay way over the odds for average brits?

On the matters of losing players. I'll start with **Carroll**. He's never looked like he's wanted to be here. He's never looked comfortable. He made a handful of good appearances at the end of last season but that's all. BR doesn't owe him anything. If he doesn't fit into his system, be it his footballing ability or his **rumoured** attitude behind closed doors (drinking, partying, dreaming of going back to the toon) then let him go. I don't care if we had Lionel Messi playing for us, if someone doesn't want to be at LFC they can fuck off. The money it cost to bring him here has been spent. Clubs make dud signings for a lot of money all the time. It happens. If Carroll wants to work hard to fit the system, prove his worth and show a bit of loyalty to the LFC family, then he's welcome to stay in my book, but if BR doesn't believe he's right for the future of LFC then that's his decision to make. Will it be the right or wrong one? Only time will tell.

**Skrtel** - I would be very, very fucked off if he left for Man City. I remember seeing Dan Agger in an interview saying he would NEVER play for another club in England after Torres left and called him disrespectful (Dan Agger &lt;3 ) I would feel the same about Skrtel. However this interview with Kenny kind of sums things up ""Know the difference between a link and a fact"" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I2fdX6PB20 If Skrtel went to Real Madrid you could kind of accept it, as he's at his peak now and wants to win trophies. We aren't a top club anymore. It would hurt but it would have to be so. This is football.

**Bellamy** - I can't see him going anywhere if BR wants him to stay. I reckon BR wants him at Anfield too. He has the pace we need and would make a great 60th minute sub in my opinion. I wonder how Bellamy feels about the Cardiff rebranding too? When a new manager comes in there's always talk of everyone going everywhere. Let's just hold off on this one. Bellamy never wanted to leave first time around and I doubt he wants to leave this time.

I agree we've been **linked** with Average players and we bought some average players **in the past**, however BR has only signed Borini, who was a bargain in today's market and so far, looks like he could be a great signing for us as we need goals and he has them in him going by his stats. I wouldn't be too hasty to criticize any signings until they play. I remember someone said to me ""Voronin could turn out to be a better signing than Torres"" because he scored one or two in Pre-Season and Torres missed a penalty. We are in a period of rebuilding, it could be this season where it all comes together, it could be 10 years from now. Nobody knows yet, all we can do is get behind the manager &amp; players and give them their chance to do the club proud. BR plays modern football. He's a young manager and we HAVE to give him his chance to develop his vision. Imagine if Sir Alex was sacked after a poor run in his first season? Man United would be just another Aston Villa... One European Cup back in the dark ages. Sir Alex turned Man United into what it is today and I hope that Brendan Rodgers can do the same but he wont if we're all too quick to jump the gun.",0,1342834380,null,0,false,0,c5h28ag,t3_wweqg,t1_c5h28ag,t3_wweqg,null,1435699243,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Yes, that's what I meant.

But, I think, regarding your next point, is that even though they are armed, they aren't necessarily dangerous. I doubt many people do to burgle houses planning on stabbing/killing the owner. Even if you pulled a gun, they are likely to run.

But, I was assuming the burgler would be far away, at the other end of a corridor/room for example. This means, if you shoot them, they aren't within stabbing distance, they won't be able to stab you immediately if you shoot, and the pain from being shot is likely to disable them.

However, if they are within distance, you won't be able to line up a non-lethal shot accurately, so your best option is to either shoot and hope for the best (which isn't always the best option in home security) or get away from them. This is the time you are likely to be stabbed, as they are close and it would be a reflex action.

However, if they have a gun, that is a whole different barrel of fish. They are more likely to shoot you on relfex if they have a gun pointed in your direction, so it would have to be a shoot first, ask questions later situation.

Long story short, if drone attacks are even threatened on US soil then there would be a huge outcry and it would probably make things worse.

&gt; The gun ownership situation you mentioned in Iraq and Afghanistan, was that the case at the onset of the conflict or as it is now? Cheers

Iraq has calmed down substantially since the height of the insurrection, however it's still a violent and unstable place compared to Europe. Gun ownership is still legal however, and there is actually [public debate](http://iwpr.net/report-news/shock-iraq-gun-law) over gun control. However, there are still a lot of weapons in circulation.

Afghanistan is different. Firstly it's still a war zone in much of the country, so there is far less ""rule of law"" there. In the areas that are relatively controlled by occupation or ANA forces they are more tightly controlled, although only relatively so. It's still legal to carry weapons openly (making ROE a nightmare). However, in much of the country where the rule of law is at best a fanciful notion it largely depends on what tribal leaders want, and given there is a strong gun culture there are guns are all over the place.

&gt; [Those killed in Aurora represent less than half a day's quota of annual gun deaths in the US. Today is the rule, disguised as the exception.](https://twitter.com/MarkHarrisNYC/status/226375981705871361)

The odd thing with guns in America is the short sightedness regarding what tech (or behaviour) is empowering. They like to 'bear arms' thinking it actually means anything when it comes to challenging the government who owns tanks and can project over whelming violence. Strong unions, community ties and local food production would offer far more security.

The other issue is who benefits? The military, arms dealers, and industrialists are the problem so why would you want to feed the beast so to speak by throwing money at it? Regarding the argument about 'tyrannical legislation' it quickly becomes incredible if we switch in biological or even nuclear weapons. Guns are made a special case just like alcohol and tobacco.

The absence of guns wouldn't prevent such occurrences as today, its a silly argument and misses the bigger picture (and gets me back to the quote). Anyone sufficiently determined could probably kill more through mass poisoning, a motorway pileup, or cause more terror through arson. I see it a bit like crack, I don't want people to become addicted to the false empowerment and 'buzz' around fire arms. People have demonstrated that in this thread. Dissuading mass gun ownership is desirable because of simple probability and not giving credit to the terrible idea of security/empowerment through gun ownership. The more guns there are the more opportunity there is for someone in a fit of madness to use them.

It certainly doesn't seem to have much impact on the mass killings, though it may be a different story as regards suicides and domestic violence.

It isn't that much of a pay bump, an extra 35k a week to take him to the level of a long term star player. It would also remove any ambiguity of his long-term future.

I'd much rather our salary structure reward players who fit in the team and are part of our playing spine than taking a shot on players like Cole and Bellamy who are on large wages and can't be offloaded. I would want every new player to be on a Suarez and Meireles style contract for the first 12 months. That is exactly what Siguardson turned down. If they fit into the team you then extend them a new contract after the first 12 months, or you sell them while their wages are manageable.

The alternative is that we end up with 6 or 7 players, chewing through 20-30M per year in wages, with zero transfer value and no ability to offload them.

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"&gt; I think John Henry was definitely displeased with the results, and may have thought that necessary to sack him. But, how do you think everyone would've reacted to that?

We already know how the fans reacted to that, because it's what happened. When he was sacked, not a single mention of the Suarez affair was made as a reason or justification for the sacking. Poor league form was the main, if not only, reason given.

&gt; The fans would say that he had more league points, a trophy, and was a bad half of football away from winning the FA Cup.

He had **less** league points. And Ayre said something along the lines of ""cups are nice, but the league is above and beyond more important"" - whether or not you agree with that sentiment. 

&gt; That, on top of what he had achieved as a player, was enough to keep the wolves from the door.

Unlikely. FSG had been keen from the moment they bought the club to install a young, ambitious manager and start with a clean slate. It's probably part of the reason why they didn't sack Hodgson straight away - they thought they'd let him get through the whole season and then replace him with their preferred candidate. Given that Kenny wasn't ""their man"", the bar was always going to be set higher for him - and finishing 8th after spending so much on new players was justifiable for sacking in itself. The Suarez affair could have not happened at all and Kenny still probably would have lost his job for that league performance.

&gt;  It was an out for Henry. He could now say ""this club doesn't tolerate this certain behaviour"" (which is funny, cos I don't see him urgently trying to sell Suarez).

As explained above, I don't think Henry needed an 'out'. As for Suarez, I think the club as a whole still feel that the process was shambles (especially the 'guilty on balance of probability' verdict). Otherwise, were it a more clear cut situation, I'm sure the club would have acted differently - see Barton at QPR.

As for Dalglish &amp; Comolli, I disagree. No player came in without Kenny giving the approval for it. In particular I'd say the effort to buy British/homegrown players was a Dalglish preference, whether or not Comolli shared it. And Kenny has always had an inclination to spend big on transfers throughout his managerial career.",0,1342848946,null,0,false,0,c5h59gj,t3_wvbus,t1_c5h59gj,t1_c5gvb2g,null,1429430601,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Rodgers hasn't been appointed solely on the basis of his PR acumen - remember when we were discussing managerial candidates before they announced Rodgers, there were plenty of positive arguments in favour of Rodgers without any mention of his media skills (which came as a pleasant surprise to many of us). If Kenny had gotten us to the Champions League, or come very close and ended up 5th or 6th, FSG wouldn't be as fussed about his media image; they might still not find it ideal, but his main job was on the football pitch. But after the investment they made in the playing squad, to finish with fewer points, lower in the table, and 27 points off fourth meant that Kenny was going to go regardless of whether he was as good with the media as Harry Redknapp (or take your pick of a more dignified media presence).

true,ColonelMolerat,null,null,"I own an independent shop, in a field (musical instruments) that luckily isn't at much risk from other high-streets stores. My main competition is the internet. The big problem there is that suppliers give *huge* discounts for very big bulk orders, so large, warehouse-based companies can get such big discounts (for buying thousands of something) that, in some cases, they can sell them at retail *for lower than I can buy them trade*.

However, that was besides the point. I came here to say that I love independent shops and, owning one, see things from their side as well. Many of us own shops because *we love doing it*. We have been given a chance to do our dream job and, as a result, many small shops do it *very well indeed*.

It frustrates me that so many high streets are masses of chain shops. I see the benefits they bring (I shop at supermarkets for the big shop, get what I can elsewhere and I get hard-to-find things online, for example) , but local councils pursue their money at the expense of everything else in a town. My city is pretty good at having independent shops, which is a draw for tourists (one of our main industris) but those who manage it are looking for more big businesses, as they give more reliable cash.

I wish that it just felt there was a balance - local councils caring as much for small businesses as they do for the big ones. Trying to attract start-ups, rather than just another branch of a big chain.

Also, something I learned that surprised me:

A retail park (or market, I can't quite remember) here wanted Debenhams to open a store. Debenhams wanted £100,000 for shop fitting and *five* years rent free. They were refused (a good decision, in my mind) but another small town agreed and they opened there.

Legends: Right across the street from the Empire State Building, the bar downstairs is called 'The Football Factory'. Really easy to find, 6 West 33rd St (between 5th and Broadway). Closest subway stop is 34th St - Herald Square (Lines B, D, F, M and N, Q, R), while 34th St - Penn Station is also nearby (Lines 1, 2, 3). This place is pretty large though it can fill up quick, decent selection of beers on tap and above average bar food

For any hookah fans there is a chain called Horus which I love. In Alphabet City they have several locations. My pick would be Horus Cafe &amp; Kebab House on Avenue B and 6th St (right on the corner). This one has outdoor seating (inside gets super loud after 10pm) and a guy called Chico, or Mr Chico to you. Man loves his job and will break out crazy flavour combinations for you, a lot of stuff that isn't on the menu. Ask for him and he'll tell you about his mixes, the Starbuzz stuff that isn't on the menu etc. They make their own charcoal here which is great, but it takes some time to get going so while this place opens at 4pm every day, I wouldn't go before 530. Drinks suck here, that is the downside, come for hookah and coffee, get blaggo somewhere else. 4pm-4am everyday

Right round the corner and 1 block down from Horus is my favourite place to get a steak. Intimate little Italian place called Lavagna (545 East 5th, on the corner of E 5th and Ave B). This place has an amazing filet dish, called the Lavagna Special or something like that. My favourite steak in NYC, I've eaten it up to 4 times in a single week. It's only $26 too, ridiculous for the quality. All around great restaurant but the wine list is very heavily skewed towards Italian wines, which aren't my favourite. The prices for the wine list are also extortionate, just a heads up. I'd highly recommend you find time to eat here and partake in some steak, I don't know how they get the mashed potatoes so smooth but it's like silk

Pool/table tennis/foosball/sports bar fans? Slate NYC on 54 West 21st Street (between 5th and 6th). Place is really fun, has about 15 pool tables, 6 table tennis tables, 6 foosball tables, lots of big screen HD TV's, huge bar area (2 bars in fact). Great place to kick back for a while. Floor manager is a flamboyantly homosexual black guy who will go out of his way to make sure you have a good time. Love this place, while I used to play pool (English 8-ball) at a national level, it's no longer fun for me. Give me a table tennis paddle and some booze, I'll be happy for hours though

The beer selection is expectedly good, though don't get here too late. I showed up at 1130pm on a Tuesday night once and it was closed

Burgers? There's a 'not-so-secret' place at Le Parker Meridian on West 57th and 6th Ave, called 'The Burger Joint'. You have to ask when you enter the hotel as it's not labeled and the entrance is actually behind a curtain. Douchey pretentions aside, it's a great burger and was voted best in NYC.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"I actually have to respectfully disagree about Aidy being unpredictable with the ball at his feet: from the time I've spent watching him, I feel that he generally has only two moves, which are 1. knock the ball past the full back and beat him with pace and 2. put his foot on the ball and pass it back. What we need from him is tighter ball control at his feet - if he could dribble with the ball like Snodgrass, then he'd be so much better. Admittedly, that might be a tad unrealistic because Snodgrass is just so naturally talented, but the reason I say this is because he can usually beat his marker once or twice through pace alone, at the beginning of the game, before the opposition grow wise to it and just stop him from doing that.

Having said that, if he could just improve on his end product (crossing and finishing) then that would be a massive improvement: I couldn't count number of times he was set up with a sitter at the back post (towards the end of last season) and failed to even connect with the ball, but we would have finished much higher if he had more of a cutting edge in front of goal.

This might sound rather negative, but I'm still happy that he's signed a new contract: he has tremendous pace, is willing to work hard for the team (and has the nous to track back when played as a winger), and last season I saw a definite improvement in his positioning - e.g. 'outbodying' other players to let the ball run out of play, or to put himself in pole position to get to the ball first. So he's clearly still learning and picking things up.

We had a relatively thriving shopping centre called Victoria Circus which the council spent a fortune putting a roof over the top of.  This led to the immediate closure of the only decent pub in town which served real ales, excellent lagers, and the like.  To make their money back, the council raised the rents and now the shopping centre, renamed Victoria Plaza, is virtually empty.

We also had a great little warren of independent shops in a place called York Road market.  The council, in its wisdom, demolished the lot and turned it into a car park.

Basically, they've succeeded in pretty much gutting the town.

true,[deleted],null,null,"One thing nobody's mentioned yet is the way banks treat small business vis-a-vis chains. A lot of expansion of chains is done by debt, which they can raise quite cheaply.  From the banks point of view this is safe, because they have a proven business model and competency.  Smaller businesses are seen as more of a risk, and banks have been particularly reluctant to lend to them since the banking crisis.

I mean, if you wanted to set up your own independent pharmacy, you'd need tens of thousands of pounds of capital, which your average pharmacist is not going to have lying around.  People who would have money put aside to save, have instead been investing in housing, which is really illiquid.  So they need to get a loan.  And why would a bank loan to someone setting up a new pharmacy in an existing area, when it's already a saturated market?  Consolidation of ownership of capital is just the natural tendency of things.

In pharmacies I don't much care, even - there's not much local distinctiveness that's being lost, it's hardly as if purchasing decisions are going to vary at your local independent chemist.  But there are other sectors (clothing, food being the most prominent ones) where it is kinda rubbish.

In France it is happening, too.  It's a couple of decades behind us, but it's going down that path.

I agree our political parties are part of the problem.  The way they are funded is difficult - vested interests such as large companies and unions (representing certain industries) are able to control their agenda so that the general benefit hardly seems to register.  Not overtly, necessarily, but your ""pay tax or GTFO"" suggestion would be anathemic to any of the 3 main parties, it's not even part of their internal debate.

You can't automatically take the children away just because the parents are lazy/feckless, there needs to be genuine risk of abuse/neglect.  It's not fair on a child to be taken from its parent regardless of how little the parent deserves to parent it.

Between series 6 and 7 = The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe (on Netflix as part of series 6)

There's also been a bunch of bonus online material, plus a couple of minisodes written by schoolkids as part of various contests, but I don't know if you'd count those. 

7. Torchwood is a separate entity.  It is (possibly was?) a spinoff show based on characters/a premise set up in Doctor Who.  The two shows exist in the same universe and cross over a bunch, but they're two different shows.

You imply that religion has a place alongside the big bang theory.

1000 years ago they would have said that figuring out what causes illness, disease, lightning, rain, tides, waves etc ""nigh on impossible to find out""... and attributed them to god's mysterious ways as ~~you~~ *some people* are doing with the big bang. Assuming the human race lasts another 1000 years, I'm reasonably certain that we will know what caused the big bang and hundreds of other things that we don't even know the QUESTION to, let alone the answer.

They are utterly,completely prohibitive to a new startup. The problem is further compounded by banks and finance providers making it immensely difficult, nay impossible to build the capital required for opening a high street store. 

I was being asked to provide £25,000 minimum up front cash to secure the funds required to open a tiny store in a city centre. This was even before I started adding costs for decoration, equipment, staff, and so on. Just to secure funds, I have to provide a bank £25,000. And I have an exceptionally good credit record, own a house, a modern car, and so on.

It really despairs me that we are in such a situation where every high street has the same boring shops owned by the same mega-
corporations, and new startups are effectively priced out of starting up even when high streets are chock-full of empty units, shops and buildings.

Go to Switzerland, Bern, Zurich etc, and all the shops are different more often than not independently owned establishments. Of course there are chain stores, but the majority is not. 
What's more, during a 2 month market research study my findings suggested that consumers generally finds shopping in such environments so much more fun due to the diversity of retailers and the fact that every street isnt a carbon-copy of one another.

true,SMTRodent,eng-nottinghamshire,Back in Nottnum,"I love our gun laws, and want them to stay as strict as they already are, but America has a totally different culture and legal setup. I think banning guns across the US could end in disaster rather than making things safer, unless there was a cultural shift in the way people there think about guns, and mainly in how guns are depicted in stories and films and dramas and whatnot. 

In American films, guns are used by heroes to win against the bad guys. If the bad guys are armed, the answer is usually for the hero to get a bigger, badder gun. Heroes are generally solitary, iconic figures and any 'system' that surrounds them is usually getting in the way of their heroism. There's a whole media/culture feedback loop going on, and that informs how people view and use guns in real life. 

There are also large areas where hunting is a big facet of life during some seasons of the year. It's not something done by hobbyists; it's part of the local culture and a big chunk of their food supply. Telling people they can't have guns isn't going to go down well. I think the necessity of having guns to hunt with mixes in a horrible way with the heroic mythology around gun-toting badasses, but it is going to take generations to change that mythology. We have people who hunt with guns here, lots of them, but they're not at all encouraged to wave those guns around at intruders and I don't think they feel at all tempted by Hollywood-style badassery.",0,1342881892,null,0,false,0,c5h8zq4,t3_wvuqc,t1_c5h8zq4,t3_wvuqc,null,1429432415,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'll scan for some now, but what I recall reading before was, for example, in admittedly less than mainstream peer-reveiwed journals, that permaculture at least equals and at most substantially exceeds the production per square acre of monoculture (particularly in tropical and subtropical climates, it has to be noted - the evidence is much more spare for temperate zones, but then the practice is hardly being tested at all because the big players are rabidly opposed to it).

Second, I'd point out that fertilizers are an issue in themselves, of course.  Ending the use of many of the most harmful fertilisers, stopping damaging the long term health of the soil and trying to work with nature - rather than against it - would all be major wins (so long as yields don't suffer).  I certainly don't accept that agribusiness is less harmful to the environment than permaculture farming (though it may well be better than trying to use the same industrial practices in a scaled down way).  If you have _any_ vaguely credible studies which support this, I'd _love_ to see them.

Monoculture has led to the domination of Western diets by processed food and particularly by monocultured corn (already a majority of the food in the average supermarket - so much for choice), neither of which has proved good for the envorinment nor public health.  One merely needs to examine the changes in patterns of diseases as the Western diet permeates countries which were relatively unexposed to it previously to see this.

true,pylori,cnty-england,East Midlands,"&gt;Because it's a human organism at conception

The fact that it's foetus that's been conceived is an emotional argument, because the line is much more blurred than that. For example before 24 weeks the foetus is very unlikely to survive outside the womb (with or without medical intervention), and developmentally as well it is still at an early stage. The point of this matter is that if a woman does abort their baby, is there any real harm from the point of view of the foetus?

If we look at statistics allowing abortion is safer, because it brings down maternal mortality rate associated with illegal abortions. Would you rather allow the abortion of an unborn foetus, or allow hundreds of thousands of women to undergo illegal abortions which are very dangerous and has a high probability of killing them as well as the unborn foetus? As much as anyone can disagree with abortion for whatever reason, I just do not understand how making it illegal solves anything. If anything it creates a problem with maternal deaths and as a result I think the overall harm done is far more by making it illegal.

&gt;Just because some people do something for one reason does not mean that everyone has that reason.

true,pylori,cnty-england,East Midlands,"In our (private) hospital, self-pay private (that is non-insurance) patients typically pay 70-80% of the rate that insurance companies (like BUPA) would charge. This is basically to encourage those that pay out of pocket to not be put off by the fact that they're having to pay the same as some massive corporate entity. I found that quite interesting.

Anyway, to the point our hospital already prioritises private patients over NHS, meaning those going through choose and book are more likely to wait longer than private patients. And to be honest I'm not massively surprised. If you were paying insurance premiums wouldn't you be a bit gutted that an NHS patient was waiting for the same time as you? What would make it worthwhile for you to carry on paying for insurance? As to whether that wait is artificial I'm not sure. But, at the end of the day, waiting times for choose and book patients at private hospitals are still going to be less than that of NHS hospitals.

To be clear I'm not agreeing with this practice, just that from the point of view of a company with shareholders and a board of directors, they need to ensure that their private patients aren't feeling like their money is worthless and I can understand that. But it's not like it's driving away NHS patients, they're still preferring their treatment here, where possible, and about 50% of cases are NHS anyway.

besides being wrong, this could not be any less relevant. So what if it holds all your genetic material? My sperm holds all *my* genetic material, and my partners eggs hers, that will go to father my children, does that mean by masturbating I'm killing potential life and I should stop doing it, and she should stop menstruating because every egg that's not implanted is a life lost? Of course not.

Moreover from a genetics standpoint, you are wrong. There are epigenetic changes that occur in the body, as well as mutations (not all of which are bad), and of course environmental factors that are definitely important in shaping someone to who they are going to be. This is especially evident in two twins separated at birth who grew up separately. They may appear physically identical but there are differences. Did you know, for example, that even identical twins don't share the same fingerprints? And genetically they are not 100% identical either due to epigenetic changes. They may be for the most part, but not on an absolute scale.

&gt;You say that the fetus would not survive outside the womb but I should remind you that a child would not survive outside without help for it would not be fed it would not be sheltered and often without medical attention it would die.

I am not talking about simply necessities for life. What a horrible comparison. I am talking about advanced medical intervention such as ventilation machines, drugs, etc. Even with all the medical technology we have today foetuses born before 24 weeks are not developed well enough to survive even if given things like oxygen, nutrition, etc. There's a whole host of things that the womb provides for that we cannot replicate externally. it's just too young, it relies on the mother and at that point I think it's hard to consider it a separate entity when it can barely support itself in existence.

&gt;while I understand your concern for the mother's health again I should remind you that it is the children that leave first on a sinking ship or on a building burning because we value the children's life over that of the parents who have lived their lives

Again, another ridiculous and fallacious appeal to emotion. Women and children have left on sinking ships and that more likely reflects the fact that they are young and less likely to be able to defend themselves and fight for survival. Women going with them is a tradition as well because traditionally women have been the ones to raise the children and be the homemakers while the father took care of the finances and worked for a living.

Childrens lives are to be valued, I don't disagree. But the entire argument of pro-lifers rests on the fact that children should be valued fully like one human being. With your argument you're merely saying they're now somehow worth more than their parents. So what is it?

Besides, it comes to a game of numbers, are you willing to ban abortion, just to try and somehow 'save' the lives of unborn children, all the meanwhile you're perfectly okay with increasing the chance that the mother will die in illegal abortions? Please note that this can and does kill the unborn child along with it (making your fight worthless because you 'saved' no life). Even if the baby does survive, are we okay with sending the message that we want mothers to die? Yeah, lets leave the baby to a single dad, because having two parents to support the child wouldn't have been better from a pyschological and financial standpoint.

Your points are absolutely ridiculous and rest on nothing but emotional pleas. The simple fact is that banning abortion creates more deaths than it saves. You're okay with allowing more mothers to die just for the vague idea that they should be forced to conceive a child they don't want?

This isn't a small issue of people seeking illegal abortions. To those countries that do still disallow abortions it is readily observable. In america when abortion was ruled legal, entire wards in hospitals closed down because they only dealt with sick mothers who were in such a position because they got unsafe abortions. Things like sepsis and septicaemia are no laughing matter.

Making abortion illegal **increases deaths**, so no matter what you think about 'saving' the lives of unborn children, you cannot, in good conscience, be okay with allowing more people to die because of your misplaced emotions.

Well it would be up to the ex-Royals what they did with THEIR property. What makes you think the State would get the houses/palaces/castles if we abolished the Royals? Because it wouldn't. 

If we abolished the Royals or if on ascension Charles refused to renew the civil list payments (as every new King/Queen has the chance to do) then they may regain control of the crown estate and its £7bn portfolio.

The UK makes a lot of money off of the land which once 'belonged' to the crown, the land George III traded to parliament in return for taking on his debts (which we are still servicing) and a civil list annuity. The argument for the royal family being profitable is that if the UK became a republic the former royal family would get that land and we would be financially worse off, which is bollocks.  
  
We might have to pay them some small fraction of the value of their holdings, like the Greek government had to do after their former royal family sued them in the European Court of Human Rights, but probably not for land which hasn't belonged to them in 400 years (I would argue they never really owned it anyway).  
  
For reference the king of Greece was awarded 12 million. This is the conclusion of the ECHR  
&gt;The Court observed that the compensation to be fixed did not need to reflect the idea of wiping out all the consequences of the interference in question. As the lack of any compensation, rather than the inherent illegality of the taking, was the basis of the violation found, the compensation did not need necessarily to reflect the full value of the properties.

You have to pay in Germany income tax like a single person altough you have a child. You just have to pay a little bit less, because you are free of the solidarity tax contribution, which you have to pay, if you do not have any children.

Still, it's not fair when you compare it to the tax rate of a married couple, no mather if they have children or they do not.

&gt; The property is bought and paid for by the public, many times over.

What are you basing that on?
Royal properties are owned by the Crown Estate, this is NOT funded via the public as it actually makes a massive profit of [£240 million in 2012](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Estate) which goes right back to the Treasury i.e. the tax payer. 

&gt;We can leave them a small house or two

Well their property such as Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House are not actually owned by the Crown Estate and are privately owned and they are still citizens of the UK and are protected by law so you can't just take private property. 

&gt;even if the Monarchy could be made into a profitable entity it still wouldn't make me happy.

[£240 million profit in 2012](http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/news-media/news/2012/annual-report-and-accounts-2012/) again straight into the Treasury. How can you say it's not a ""profitable entity"" what are you basing that on?


&gt;But It's a point of principle .. I would prefer an elected head of state to one ""decreed by god"".

Fair enough and it may seem out dated today and I would agree but you can't say they don't pay their share.

Furthermore as I said before if we abolished the monarchy they would lose the Civil List payment we currently pay (around £40 million a year) but they may gain control of the [£8billion Crown Estate portfolio](http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/news-media/news/2012/annual-report-and-accounts-2012/) and the £200 million that brings in, that currently goes to the Treasury.



EDIT: Doing a bit of research and found out that within regard to the Civil List payment : [""This arrangement is to be changed starting from 2013 whereby the Civil List will be abolished, and the profits from the Crown Estates divided between the Government and the Monarchy.""](http://www.royalinsight.net/content/british-monarchy-frequently-asked-questions)

You can offer rewards for sterilisation, but for people that are desperate enough to have kids for cash, is that almost forcing them in to it as much as forced sterilisation (if the reward is cash, of course).

true,KingDaveRa,eng-buckinhamshire,Buckinghamshire,"I know couples, who waited, and planned, and decided when they could afford to have a child. I also know many single mothers, who got pregnant by accident, had a kid, and live off benefits. They don't work, they just have kids. They usually have kids with various different fathers - fathers who should be hit up for the cost, but aren't, they just allowed to run away - and basically live on state handouts. They get a free house, and everything paid for. What annoys me is how they'll still somehow have their Sky tv (hardly a life necessity, yet they'll have it) and cigarettes. 

Back in the day, the benefit system was put in place to help peolpe who fell on hard times. These days it's considered a legitimate way to live. 

As somebody who has worked since I was 15 (basically half my life now) , it does annoy me. My parents have always worked. I remember, some years ago my dad got made redundant. He took pretty much the first job that came his way, which paid next to nothing. Despite the face he was working, my mum was working, we barely managed to get by. We lived in a pretty ordinary council house, we didn't have multi-channel tv, didn't go on holiday for years. We were told we weren't eligible for anything really, as my parents basically eared too much. Even worse, when we DID get working tax credits, a few years later they asked for them back. 

So the moral of the story is - work, and fall on hard times - tough. Don't work, ever, but have a family, and you can have anything you like.
