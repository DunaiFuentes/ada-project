true,widgetas,null,null,"A good many people do think that that's is what's being done though, at least in my experience.

I was recently talking about the evils of the Catholic hierarchy in their handling of the sex abuse cases before it became well known in the public sphere. My (Italian) Catholic friend got rather agitated until I made it expressly clear that I wasn't tarnishing all Catholics with the same brush. (As it happens I believe that rates of paedophilia are the same among the priesthood as with any other demographic - the difference is of course in how those 'in charge' dealt with it/covered it up).

Similarly with Islam, unless you make it quite clear *what* you're criticising people are often quite quick to assume you are attacking the whole group (all ~billion of them) as one, which is of course ridiculous. Unfortunately with Islam there is also often the assumption that one is being 'Islamophobic'. A possible danger, of course, and something we should be on the look out for, but I find that people will very often dismiss you out of hand for some perceived slight they think you have committed. As such very often one has to make it perfectly clear one isn't siding with the EDL etc. My own example with this is when I raised the issue on here of how women in the Muslim community are not really very prominent in public issues. I got numerous downvotes and one solitary comment telling me, more or less, to mind my own business.

true,aussie_gecko1892,null,null,"All game I think it is fair to say we were on top. Reina had just the one save to make and City really didn't make many chances. We created chances throughout the game but we once again didn't do much with it. Our corners were just crap, not sure how many we had but I mean we can we get it over the first man more that 50% of the time??? Also, although we played fantastic, we gave the ball away that little bit to often.

Onto the goals. De Jongs goal was fantastic, nothing Reina could do about it. The fact that he slipped while kicking it probably actually helped him because it put so much curl onto the ball. However, he was in too much space. Silva got the ball and we crowded him, but Adam left De Jong and gave him the space (yes, overly critical but I like to pick at the small things to improve). 

Next, the penalty. It was a penalty and here is why. If you were to do A sliding tackle 10 times, not once would you get your arms above your head like that. What he did was throw him self at the ball, getting anything in the way. If the shot had going up and hit his arm directly, it would be a penalty due to the intent that is there, so the ball coming off the foot and hitting the arm may be different, but the intent is most certainly the same. Good on Gerrard for sticking it away.

Dzekos goal is down to a few things. Firstly, Gerrard is defending on this touch line and the ball gets crossed in. If you watch him, he doesn't even stick out a leg. I'm not saying he dosen't throw him self at it to block it, he doesn't even stick a leg out. It is like he was either not wanting to concede a corner, or thought he might get a second yellow. As the ball is coming across, I do want to question Johnson. The ball is traveling 20 meters to get to him and I am not sure what happens. he is defiantly close enough to get a touch on it, but something happens and he doesn't I'm not sure, but I feel he should have got something on it. The defending in the center could have been better also, but you are defiantly afraid to get too much contact on that ball and stick it in your own net. 

Bellamy' goal was great all round. Came from Lescott kicking the ball out needlessly but the play fro there as great. Kuyt does really well to just hold it up and lay it to Bellamy. The 1-2 is good with a very well finished shot at the end. One of the few times though it has o be said that Johnson got into the box for Liverpool today.

Kuyt had almost as great a game as Bellamy, they both worked their hearts out and just never really stopped running. It is those players that are just fantastic in a team. Downing was better today, got on the ball more and was able to cut in once or twice. I was impressed with him. Gerrard was as good as ever. Adam was better than he has been but I have to be critical on him now. He makes some really needless and stupid tackles. Not as much today but he still made a few. 

Overall, Fantastic performance from Liverpool, completely deserved the win. Now to beat Man U on the weekend.

Consider this, there is one great player on team A. He is an awesome knuckleballer and has a .219 strike rate. The rest of the team only has one arm. Their ability to play baseball is severely curtailed. But can they still compete in the game? Yes. Knuckleballer can throw a shutout and maybe hit a home run. 

Now put Lionel Messi in a team of one legged people. How much impact is he likely to have in a game scenario? The whole defense will mark him, and as great a player as he is, its quite easy to shut him down.

Stupid example, but does prove a point.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Brief rundown first- Doctor Who ran from 1963-1989 then rebooted in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963. You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor. The ninth only has one series with some questionable writing, but he's a fantastic Doctor as well, and shines when given the chance.

The reason why River says this is to explain in canon why she looks younger in Silence but is the oldest version of River we have seen. Namely, the actress was at her youngest when the character was at her oldest. It is like the throwaway about changing genders, it is a line in the show which until we have more data, we should just assume others have the ability, namely due to the fact that River is still not a full fledged Timelord.

I remember watching the third story, Edge of Destruction, and finding it boring and thinking the only redeeming part was the dramatic speech at the end.

Rather than face it, he choses to run but simply can't defeat it since it is truly a part of him.

Your core point is that Muslims may *choose* to rape because of their religion. This is bullshit. All men have the capacity to rape, particularly where brought up by misogynistic parents. The UK has had a whole series of women killers, particularly focused on street prostitutes and no one is arguing that being brought up with Christian values led to this.

&gt; Are you telling me that stonings for women adulterers is fair? And I know it's not Islam as a whole

Stoning ""fair""? If you are going to invent strawman arguments, at least pick something that's vaguely close to the topic at hand. 

It's not even ""Islam"" that's stoning people for adultery. Hindus in the same region do it as do a number of other religions such as the Yazidi in Kurdistan. Even Buddhists farther east have given out similar punishments throughout history. It's a backwards **cultural** thing, not religious. Where are the banks of Muslims born in western countries calling for it? 

&gt; it's a small amount of idiots doing this under the banner.

Perhaps, but the banner is not what's driving the behaviour. At best they are using scripture to advocate it to others but what makes them believe it themselves is their own upbringing, the beliefs taught to them by their parents and peers. The Christian Old Testament is almost identical WRT stoning yet we have *chosen* to move on from it.

I agree completely with your logic behind the penalty call, I thought the same thing.  In the laws of the game, determining a deliberate handball the ref considers ""whether the arm moved towards the ball, how long the player had to react, whether the player had his eyes on the ball and whether the players arm is in a 'natural' or an 'unnatural' position.""  The first three conditions can be obviously excused so its all down to whether it was in a natural or unnatural position.  A direct impact on the arm should be called the same as the deflection of the leg.  It's never black and white, but you could easily make the case for a penalty there.

The reality is that Christianity, like almost any other religion, is a deep and mysterious pool of conflicting opinions, with scripture being used as a guide to thought processes. The contradictions within the Old Testament (and therefore, obviously the Torah), are not evidence of the relevant religions' fallibility, but evidence of the long history of debate within those groups who have faith in its over-reaching message, and in fact highlights just how odd the preachers in the bible belt are, and how unreasonable and un-Christian they're being.

This may well be the only point you and I agree on, I think that our Justice system is deeply flawed too and wastes a shit load of money.

&gt; Honestly to reduce crime the best alternative right now would be to not have a prison system at all

Ok, I understand how Prison may not always be the best way to deal with a particular criminal. But do you honestly believe that not having a prison system at all is the right way to go about things? Despite the protests from a minority of the left wing, some people are literally too dangerous to be allowed to walk the streets, and must be held in the maximum security available. Some murderers, rapists, arsonists etc are completely incapable of being re-rehabilitated and must be kept away from the rest of society. It's very naive to think otherwise.

&gt; because I and others do not want to waste money on your retribution system.

It isn't a retribution system, it's a system designed to punish criminals for criminal behaviour, and to act as a deterrent. Unfortunately at the moment it is completely failing in this regard. It  is far too lenient on those who commit serious crimes, whilst overeating to situations that are best dealt with with a softer approach.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; Ok, I understand how Prison may not always be the best way to deal with a particular criminal. But do you honestly believe that not having a prison system at all is the right way to go about things?

Actually no. My ""get rid of prison"" refers only to the false decision between our current system and no system. As in if today we got rid of prison our incidence of crime would start reducing long term. Mainly by shattering the prison criminal networking society and the fact that criminals are not being taught that society isn't for them. There are better ways of doing it that retain some sort of prison.

However I do believe a more sensible tiered system is a small number of hard core prisons for people who cannot be left out. A larger number of more rehabilitation focused prisons that would serve some of the remainder. Mostly people who have committed multiple non-violent crimes, a more minor violent crime or has breached the terms of their community sentence. A stronger community sentence system.

As for deterrence. There is no evidence that prison has a strong deterrent effect.",0,1327574229,null,0,true,0,c3kt632,t3_ovtj3,t1_c3kt632,t1_c3kt4tr,null,1435746015,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It would probably work the same way it does now when Doctors (or people in **any** other field) want to work abroad. 

&gt;What about Scottish hospitals being financed; that financing would have been arranged based on Scotland being part of the UK.

I assume the contracts would be transferred to the Scottish government. But it isn't just England paying for them at the moment, we're paying partially for them too, just like we're partially paying for all English hospitals.

&gt;The prime minister, Gordon Brown, and his wife, Sarah, attended, as did David Cameron, the Conservative Party leader and prime minister–to–be, and his wife, Samantha. Rupert Murdoch, The Sun’s owner, had flown in. Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth and her husband, the P.R. man Matthew Freud, who had helped to orchestrate the “media blackout,” had driven over from Burford Priory, their $7 million, 22-bedroom country home, 15 miles away. The guest list attested to the power Rebekah Wade had achieved, at the age of just 41, as the editor of The Sun, a tabloid with three million readers, and as the first woman to hold that job. But it also attested to her charm, “her warmth,” her “gregariousness,” and “her straightforward, sympathetic manner,” because the guests were also close friends. Sarah Brown had her for “sleepovers” at Chequers, the prime minister’s country retreat. David Cameron was so close he reportedly signed his letters to her “Love, David.”

&gt;That the media blackout had been so successful was even more surprising, considering that, by 2009, Wade had become something of a celebrity herself, with her first husband, Ross Kemp, a star of the hugely popular soap opera EastEnders, and then with Charlie Brooks. Endlessly written about and photographed—at Ascot, sitting in the royal box at Wimbledon, helicoptering to the Glastonbury Festival—she was instantly recognizable with her pile of red ringleted hair. In the competitive, ruthless, often cruel, and largely male culture of the British tabloids, Wade stood out. She spoke French, and had attended the Sorbonne; she and Charlie Brooks were at the center of the social scene in Chipping Norton—the weekend hub of the wealthy and powerful in Oxfordshire.

I'm not sure contracts work in that way. The contract would be with UK, not Scotland, which would mean a) a penalty being paid if you wanted out of the contract and b) a renegotiated contact that, without capital to back Scotlands case, could well leave Scotland worse off. And that's before we get to the gamble (which is what it is) that the oil is going to last more than 15 years.

&gt;As for the NHS stuff, yeah I agree it is complicated, but there doesn't seem to be any other sensible way of dividing it.

You can be sure that the UK gov. won't see it that way; they'll want some sort of reimbursement for the contributions that have *built* those hospitals, etc. - the problem is in Scotlands smaller population; I'm not sure the same level of investment would have occurred if Scotland only paid for itself, because at the moment you have ten times as many contributors from the rest of the UK paying for this sort of thing as it is. Sure, you can argue over how this is distributed, but I can't see how reducing this income to less than 10% of what it was so that will improve anything north of the border.

What tyranny? Give me an example. When has Liz II been tyrannical?

&gt;Just to let you know, tourism on a macro scale cannot add to the economy, it can only take from wealth created elsewhere (even if it is sucked from international sources). Also the idea that there would suddenly be no tourism if the monarchy disappeared is plainly false, and if it did it would show just what a land void of culture and any real value Britain has become.

I said '**even if you ignore tourism**'. The Royal Family puts more into Parliaments accounts than they receive in wages from Parliament. Our taxes would be higher if the Royals were gone, not lower. Albeit only higher by about £2.60, but the point still stands.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"Hehehe I'm not a lawyer or anything like that :-) This is all speculation, but there are plenty of precedents to draw on.

For example, when many other countries have gone independent, it isn't as if the money automatically reverts to the new government; that's why (for example) [the USA is a corporation that is actually owned by the UK](http://www.natural-person.ca/pdf/Great_Britain_owns_USA.PDF). I think we own their treasury too, but I'd have to dig for a link on that. In our 'local' oil contract example, the contract signed by the UK would be binding to the point that just because part of the UK has decided it's seperate makes no difference to the company - the contract remains in place until it expires or you buy your way out of it. Of course, you can force-nationalise things, but that generally doesn't go to well for places like Zimbabwe.

I'd be amazed if the investment in the Scottish NHS was 10% or below of the total, if only because of the welfare laws guaranteeing treatment - but the point is that Scotland has been benefitting from the 10% ratio being ignored up until now; what's so great about getting rid of that? In short, if you're going to find other sources of income so that your citizens get the same level of care/ taxes/ etc, it has to be a bit more than an oil field that doesn't have that long left.

Ultimately, as you say, it's a decision for Scots if the referendum goes ahead - just remember that ultimately Scotland has a lot more to lose than the UK does. Personally I think Salmon parading children in traditional Scottish attire is more than a bit insulting - it's not as if you weren't allowed to celebrate 'Scottishness' already, so what will this achieve? What is Scotland going to do that it couldn't do before? So far, I've only heard vague-isms like 'choose our own destiny', which is great rhetoric but doesn't really have an application in real life.

As for the contribution of Scotland, again I am not going to be particularly defending this position, but I think the argument might be that Scotland has also contributed its natural resources to the benefit of the UK, so focussing simply on the tax take is misleading. Of course this works both ways, but without a proper analysis we can't determine if Scotland is a contributor or not. But you'd really have to ask a nationalist.

&gt;What is Scotland going to do that it couldn't do before? 

I can agree that the argument sometimes doesn't get beyond independence, I want to hear a lot more about what they envision for afterwards. But I am in favour of more localism, policies that benefit one region do not necessarily benefit another. I am not particularly interested in the UK's position on the world stage, I don't feel it is necessary to take on that role. I'd be happy to live in a quiet backwater of a country, that did it's own thing and got on with life. A bit like Sweden or Norway I suppose. And I think if we were able to direct investment locally we might be able to build stable industry that could sustain us. I get sick of Scotland being a land of golf courses, I'd like to see us attract, say, software industries. It offers a fantastic quality of life that might appeal to intelligent young people.

Of course a lot of it is a dream, but dreams are important. Look at how the power of the American dream helped build that country. An independent Scotland would be a huge challenge, but it's possible that something good could come from that challenge, and it is tempting to go for it, instead of hanging on to the status quo for comfort and safety, accept our handouts and keep our complaints to a few old songs at new year.

This applies as much to the rest of the UK, the world is changing and we need to step up to new challenges. Just maybe, Scotland going independent is a good way to do that, and we shouldn't let fear of change hold us back.

And I wouldn't get hung up on traditional Scottish attire, that stuff gets dragged out all the time, it isn't just the SNP that like it. ",0,1327592404,null,0,false,0,c3kut6p,t3_oxf29,t1_c3kut6p,t1_c3kui41,null,1428243496,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Also have you ever seen a news report that labelled an offender as being Jewish? What would think if they did?

You have no idea how devout he was. ""Teach them a lesson"" was just one thing he said, while also threatening them with death and raping them repeatedly. And I'm pretty sure that non-Muslims have raped people to ""teach them a lesson"" too - but somehow it only matters when it is a Muslim?

true,literallyoverthemoon,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"No. She could potentially go on television and muster up public donations on a par with Comic Relief et al, and she could do this in more than one country (although, this suggests that she has as much sway with the public as 'trivial celebrities' do), but not enough to make a lasting difference in any situation (in the same way that Comic Relief et al do little more than put band aids onto skull fractures). At best the Royal Family may be able to lobby certain charities etc towards different avenues of spending after raising a few million pounds, but that's all they, or the queen could do; lobby.

And even if the Queen single handedly raised £6billion, or even £100billion, it would not matter a jot to the despots, anarchies and broken governments which are the causes, and barriers to solutions of famines, diseases, civil wars and extreme poverty around the globe.

Adding to this is the fact that The Royal Family have, by order of constituion, no relevent powers within the realm of politics; any straying towards what may seem to be influencing/interfering in foreign politics would be flagged up and snuffed out immediately. Political work would be necessary to make any change within poor nations; the Royal family wouldn't touch it, nor would the government or civil service allow it for that matter. (It would also stink of imperialism).

Diana only produced influence with regard to landmines after her divorce, upon which she was not under the influence she was while being part of the constitutional monarchy. Even then she was accused to straying too far into the realm of politics and described as a loose cannon. Much of her influence grew after her death, and was therefore indirect. (This is not to suggest her work was not great or effective, merely that the powers that be would have preferred it not to be as it was).

true,widgetas,null,null,"It seems that the conversation has reached a peak, but as I started it all off (in a way) I think I should throw in my tuppence.

You think my belief that the rate of paedophilia in the CC being 'the same' as everywhere else is misguided. I don't think it is. But I shall start by clarifying my position.

The rate of paedophilia being the same in the CC as everywhere else refers only to the chance that any one priest will be a (practicing?) paedophile. It says *nothing* about how often that person commits a crime, for how long, where they did it or if they were allowed to continue the abuse. That's a major point to consider and I think you haven't made the distinction.

Now to be clear: I am *not* saying the that CC didn't cover up abuse. I am *not* saying that they didn't move paedophile priests around rather than hand them over to the police. I am *not* saying that there aren't a large number of priests in the CC who are likely still abusing. The CC, in general, has been complicit in huge amounts of child abuse, much of which I think is still to be uncovered, and has absolutely no defence for their crimes. They should be held to account in the highest court possible and their position as the moral guardians of humanity should be something that is derided forevermore.

To go further, in case you're unsure of my background: I was raised without a religion and have never had one. Never a belief in a god of any kind. Never saw the point, the rationale or the need to have one. I have no particular desire to protect the CC in any way shape or form, as I think many of their beliefs are ridiculous and their teachings misguided.

To be *even* clearer as to where I'm coming from: [This is a photo of me with my placard](http://i.imgur.com/ivgDD.jpg) at the Protest the Pope march in London in September 2010, when ~15,000+ marched through the city to protest the Pope's (tax payer funded) visit. I'm an active member of the BHA &amp; NSS and am one of the organisers of my local Secular Society.

I did once assume/think the way you did: that the rate of paedophilia was higher in the CC than everywhere else. It makes 'sense' right? All the cases of child abuse and all the cover ups? But it simply isn't the case - not when you consider the individuals. But of course we have to be careful how that is interpreted and I think that at the moment you're not making the distinction. I changed my mind because of information I saw here on reddit in a ""What opinion do you hold that is generally seen as 'unacceptable' or similar?"" When I questioned the person who made the claim, he provided me with information. Now I don't have it to hand, but it *must* have been plausible or I wouldn't have changed my mind!

Did the hierarchy cover up? Yes.    
Did they effectively aid in the systematic abuse of children for decades? Yes.    
Is the institution full of evil, sadistic bastards? Yes.    

But the rate is more or less the same as everywhere else. The *scale* is going to be hugely different and no-one (credible) is arguing against that, but a paedophile priest abusing 100 kids is still only one paedophile. Ratewise that equatable to one ""Scout leader"" paedophile abusing one kid.

Now there is a good deal of confusion on the issue and I personally am wary of any Catholic response to this problem. For example they tend to make the distinction between paedophilia and ephebophilia, which is missing the point slightly but understandable. As it happens when I was on the Pope protest a [Catholic man had an altercation or two with protesters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO_moGJc6r4) (including me and my mates) who told us we didn't know what we were protesting about. ""It's pederasty! Not paedophila!"" While it might sound like the guy in the video is saying a similar thing to me, he's missing the point slightly. For one thing he's defending the CC whereas the likes of me and ~p7r are not.

As for citations, here's an [article explaining the issue](http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2010/04/07/mean-men.html). From that link (and also used in the Wiki article):

&gt; [Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said, ""We don't see the Catholic Church as a hotbed of this or a place that has a bigger problem than anyone else. I can tell you without hesitation that we have seen cases in many religious settings, from traveling evangelists to mainstream ministers to rabbis and others.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_sex_abuse_cases)

[This link](http://archives.weirdload.com/stats.html) has some stats from the US, though of course one has to be careful where they come from exactly, but lifting a few numbers explains the differences here:

* US clerics (priests, deacons, bishops, etc.) accused of abuse from 1950-2002: 4,392: About 4% of the 109,694 serving during those 52 years.
* Individuals making accusations: 10,667.

Of course the number of people affected will likely be much higher than the number who make accusations (and of course therefore the number of abusers will probably be a little higher too), this outlines the important point that the number of abused is going to be very high due to the unrestricted access that priests etc. had to children, while the number of abusers is somewhat lower.    
Actually it seems this is also the problem with other religious denominations too.

I'm sorry this is so long, but it's a point of great contention. Again: I have no real wish to defend the CC at all nor will I *ever* defend institutionalised paedophila. But that doesn't mean I can ignore 'tarring with the same brush' however unimportant people might think it.

If you have evidence to the contrary - by which I mean something other than assumptions and extrapolations like that found in your link earlier - then please post it as I'd love to read it! Of *course* the rate could be higher and I'm not sure anyone without an agenda would deny it, and if there is substantial evidence to support it then I'll accept it. But at the moment I really don't think it's the case that we can conclude that way. I welcome any evidence to the contrary because it means I'll be able to update my opinion. I don't like basing my arguments on incorrect data as when it is undermined people therefore tend to assume that everything else you say is wrong.

You've just described why we have a legal tradition of innocent until proven guilty. Because otherwise those with resources could harass those without them via the legal system until something sticks. Libel is no different in this regard.

Libel only exists as it does as an intentional mechanism to infringe on free speech. Whether it is police, politicians or wealthy the law was created to stop people bringing them into question.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"Hm, I understand this about these various religions, so I think you're basically not understanding what I am saying. Probably quite the opposite, as Catholics are *less* of a problem in this regard *because* there is an infallible leader at the top (although admittedly this could cause problems if he was particularly malicious, as many Popes have been!). Allow me to explain...

Interpretation isn't the problem here at all - between sects you have different interpretations and different *beliefs* based on what the book says.

The problem is not necessarily which interpretation they pick, but rather the fact that some claim their book is absolutely 100% infallible, every word is divine truth, and the rest of that.

This is a problem because if you read one of these books and it says ""homosexuals should be put to death"", for example - how is that open to interpretation? It's really not... it's something that can be ignored, it's something people don't have to actively go and do, but it's not something where one would argue ""weeeell, you know by 'death' it doesn't mean 'death', it actually means we should be buddies with them!"" What they do instead is weasel their way out of it with ""well it's not our place to judge, that's Gods job, etc. etc."" but this does nothing to address the problem that those words are there, clear as day, with billions claiming they are perfection itself!

So, we are lucky to live in a world where the majority with these religions don't feel the need to carry these things out. Hurray. It could be worse, but it could also be better, and it's those exact people who are the only ones with the power to make it so.

With Catholicism, as you mentioned, there is a leader who is able to make infallible claims (when he wished to do so, not everything the Pope says is infallible however it is a ""power"" he is able to use when deemed fit). So if the question is put - ""It says in the bible that homosexuals should be killed. Should homosexuals be killed?"" The Pope says ""No they shouldn't"" and that's the end of it! Catholics henceforth don't believe that homosexuals should be killed. And fortunately the Pope has been somewhat progressive in recent decades (although still says plenty of outrageous things regarding pretty much everything - I don't agree with him at all).

But regardless, he can ensure that you don't get any crazy Catholics doing things that the rest of Catholicism don't agree with - in the name of Catholicism - because it's so clear when it's not!

And back to the original point in fact - the point that many religions aren't willing to totally override/ignore parts of their book, but claim they are perfect (even while not actively doing the ""bad"" things) *is* a problem.

*If* there was a leader of Sunni Muslims who everyone followed the word of, and this person claimed that homosexuals shouldn't be killed, and this huge Muslim demographic generally went along with that... then you would not have people claiming so easily that they are doing something in the name of their religion. They might still do it in the name of Islam based on their own interpretation, but this is where the psychological issue hits home hard - people like to feel they are part of this huge group that agrees with their actions when they do something in the name of religion. Who now, for example, commits atrocities in the name of dead religions with no followers, simply because a book exists with some writing in it? It is possible to create a parallel to this with the ""worst"" parts of modern religions, yet hardly anyone is willing to take even the first step.

Of course you don't *need* a leader, you can do it collectively if you have a way of agreeing or anyone with the balls to take the first step out of line with all their religious buddies. If you can open the relevant book to a Jehova's Witness, or a Sunni Muslim, and say ""Do you think this sentence is wrong?"" and get the answer ""yes"" then it will be a fucking miracle, though. I've tried!

So back to my original statement, as far as I'm concerned, as long as people aren't willing to take a stand against something bad which they are basically promoting, they should shoulder a little of the blame.

&gt; I think your belief that rates of paedophilia amongst the catholic clergy being the sand as in the general population is misguided.

I was talking specifically of individuals which, while it might not be an important point, is worth noting when it comes to the discussion as to whether or not priests should all be tarred etc. The incidences? Well yes, that's going to be much higher for priests who have access to tons of kids, compared to child minders who only have a handful of kids around them.

But I don't disagree with the essence your above comment, except to comment on this:

&gt; however there is a higher incidence of catholic priests being charged/arrested or found guilty of these offences than any other single profession.

It would depend where you're looking I suppose, for example one of the links I gave you says this:

&gt; The Wisconsin Psychological Association's survey found offenders distributed among the following professions: Psychiatrists 34%, Psychologists 19%, Social Workers 13%, Clergy 11%, Physicians 6%, Marriage Counselors 4%, and Others 14%.

It might be the case of course that the CC is higher in general, but I have no doubt that there is 'unknown' abuse in many other groups that simply isn't being reported. For one I think that instances of abuse by Muslim clerics is likely to be much higher than we know of, but that it is yet to come out. That's not to say I have anything against Muslims as such: it's just common sense/reality. People in positions of authority have the opportunity to abuse their power if they are so inclined. I imagine people said the same thing about the CC decades ago, but at the time there was no data to back up the claim.

But I had no practical experience doing that type of work, just stuff I'd gleaned from running a small lab at home. So I was reluctant to take helpdesk positions because I thought they were beneath me. I did take the jobs though, because I wasn't getting hired as a sys-admin and like you I needed a job because I had to eat. What I then realized is that I had a hell of a lot of learn about how IT works in a live production environment where it needs to work and you can't just come back to stuff the next day or wipe it and start again if you screw up. So not only did I have to learn a lot of technical stuff I also had to learn a lot about just how a business operates which was something school, college and university taught me nothing about. 

So after a year of doing helpdesk stuff in my second helpdesk job, I got promoted and made a sys-admin, something I knew I could do but something I didn't realize I couldn't do a year prior to that.  And thats when I started to see the same type of people come through interviews. Young people who wanted to do a job they weren't quite ready for yet, even though they had spent years studying the technology and thought they were, because they had absolutely no experience actually doing the job, just academic knowledge. 

And I do think my assessment is right, because one of the guys I pushed to hire as a helpdesk engineer spent about a year working his ass off learning how IT operates in a company before he got hired as a sys-admin by a firm who hadn't even given him an interview 18 months prior. 

And it's nothing I would hold against anyone either, because the way our education system works is for the most part completely academic and completely separated from the real world. And it doesn't work for a lot of the jobs that people will actually want to go on and do. This is why I'm keen on bringing back polytechnics and apprenticeships. Because it solves the argument of ""education shouldn't be all about producing workers"" by creating a path for people who want to do purely academic studies, and a path for people who are more interested in learning a set of skills that will give them more chances to become employed in a career they like rather than just looking for jobs.

true,StevieTV,scottish,Scotland,"The benefits cap is the Tories wanting to clear all the poor people out of the nice areas. It will result in mass evicitions of families living in upper and middle class areas and the expansion (and creation) of deprived areas and ghettos.

And no one on benefits actually gets £26k given to them in their hands. That is total bollocks and a myth fed to you by the Tory press.

In reality the bulk of money that is paid out in benefits is actually in the form of housing benefit that goes directly to landlords and the councils who rent out these properties.

So under the Tory plans the sick and unemployed will have to move out of their homes if the State is no longer willing to pay the rent.

A lot of young families these days are unable to afford the deposit on a mortgage and are instead renting decent properties in nice areas. If those people are unfortunate to find themselves suddenly made unemployed or unable to work through illness then they too will find that as well as having those problems they'll also have to move to a smaller property or a poorer area as the benefits cap will mean that they won't be able to get enough money to pay their rent and have enough money left over for food etc.

This will also probably create another property crash as all the landlords who have buy-to-let mortgages will lose their tenants, will be unable to pay their mortgages and will end up with them being repossessed.

It isn't a problem if you can lower your rent but in a lot of cases the rent that is being charged barely covers the mortgage payments that the landlords are making.

It's a disaster waiting to happen if it goes through.

Every week you see defenders in the box holding their arms behind them because they don't want to give up a penalty.

I do think there are much more egregious hand-ball in the box situations, but I think they are separated from this by also earning a card.  For example, if you are standing on the goal line and you willfully punch away a shot (Suarez) I think both a penalty and a red card are warranted. (But I would have done the same thing)

Secondly, after watching the replay I think intent was there anyway. If you really wanted to get as much of your lower body forward as possible you would swing your arms backward to help rotate the rest of your body forward.

They are not the causes in every case. we can bypass governments through NGO's anyway. if we're talking about a lack of clean water for example, which kills millions and millions annually, she could commit herself to ending that situation, which would cost a few billion but there are no real barriers to it. Yes civil wars, dickish leaders and other such things would get in the way from time to time but not everywhere and not most of the time. 

Again, I don't think campaigning and advocacy is politics. Does she donate money ever? She doesn't exactly set an example does she? i really don't believe shaking hands with people who have actually done something counts. How many charities is she patron of, but what does she do? How many plaques must her name be on, but again what does she actually do with this wonderful position she finds herself in. 

Ultimately, when people with great power and priviledge do nothing it upsets me. I care for the world, I understand how much suffering there is and in comparison what she has but she, nor any of the royal family appear to give a solitary fuck. 

Snuffed out? By who and what? you can't stop a private individual raising awareness and privately fundraising. 

I'm glad Diana was a loose cannon, the fact that someone who cares passionately about improving the world whilst risking their own position is something we should only applaud. I think the landmine thing died after death personally but hey, the UK (I think) and the US still haven't banned their use. we'd be in a worse place without her, which is why I think the Royals could be a force for good but frankly they aren't. 

Can't disagree whatsoever on the last point my man, not for a second. Everything is solvable, we have all of the resources for everyone on the planet to live well, we are just wasteful and have invested a lot of time and energy into preventing countries (including the UK - consider how long the establishment resisted formal education) from developing.

Even if we do sell it, we'd have to move into a smaller house which we wouldn't be able to rent out like we do now (condition of the house means we can't get very good rates). Combined with some benefits, pension and tax credits we manage to live comfortably enough as well as pay the lawyers.

For now though, I'll try and answer the questions you already posted on here.

You won't have any trouble acclimating, the percentage of americans is something like 15% and even though I wouldn't recommend taking this route, many of them tend to stick together in all-american friend groups. You will make friends pretty quickly, considering many freshers are in the same boat of not knowing many people, if anyone, that is going to uni at St. A's. The hall you're in will probably affect how easily you make friends (e.g. people in new hall are surrounded by so many people that they usually have trouble finding a solid group of friends quickly, versus sallies or mcintosh where the numbers are much smaller and it is therefore easier). Although they say you don't have any say in what hall you want to live in, what I did, and a few other people I know of as well, was send an email to the people in charge of accomodation and saying that you are still making up your mind on whether or not you want to go (bullshit) and the hall they put you in has a large role in your decision. Then just tell them what hall you want to be in. I said Sallies, and I got put in Sallies.

As for societies, it really depends on which one you're talking about. Some sports are much more intense than others (golf is on the more intense spectrum, but not quite as intense as something like rugby), and I'm not entirely sure how serious a society like debate is. I'm guessing more serious than the Harry Potter and Gin society though. Once again, the amount of time you must invest in the society depends on which society you are talking about.

The education system is very different, but probably equally challenging. Instead of having a core curriculum like you would in the states, you pick only three modules for first year, one of which will be your major. Then, in third year, you start taking only your major (someone correct me if I'm wrong, I'm only a second year). Classwork is also different - it is much more based around independent study. Unless you're in a math or language class, you can pretty much expect just two or three assignments per semester, probably presentations or essays.

Athletics are there, but much less significant than at an American school. Rugby is the only sport that really brings a crowd, and it's still wayyyyyyy smaller than most (probably all) sports at American colleges. That being said, there is probably a track and field team.

It's easy to switch your major, but only if you take the class you want to switch your major to in your first year. If you want to switch your major to IR, just tell your advisor and you should be fine.

true,literallyoverthemoon,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"I'm afraid that if you were to compare a world map of unstable countries with that of humanitarian disasters, the correlation would become resoundingly clear. Such barriers are impassable; many aid drops to broken nations do not reach their intended recipients, and in many cases get stolen and squandered by militia or armies. Movement both in and out of certain places is either extremely physically dangerous, or politically dangerous.

I believe the Queen alone is patron of 600 charities. I don't know what this entails with each charity, but the term does imply donations. She also promotes them (for example, in speeches, publications, and to millionaires over a bottle of bubbly at a dinner), and her name/photo alone will bring extra recognition and appreciation to their causes; just as celebrities do for comic relief.

International politics is an extremely complicated matter, with a large list of unwritten rules, and an army of politicians and civil servants trying to obey/work around them. A member of the Royal family is not a private individual; they are consitutionally part of the government; a part forbidden from dealing in politics. Anything seen as interference would be jumped upon from within the family itself, their relevent civil servents, politicians, and beyond that the government. A royal over stepping the mark would create a political, constitutional and media circus, which no one wants. What if the Queen had been (quite rightly) outspoken about Col Gaddaffi's rule while Tony Blair and George Bush were shaking hands with him in order to secure chemical/radioactive weapns amnesty? An international incident would have ensued, undermining the work of the government, upsetting a rogur nation amid talks, and setting an embarrassing scene for the UK amongst other world powers. For reasons including those in this example, the Royal family know to stear well clear of anything political.

I too am very glad about Diana's landmine crusade, but my point is that she no doubt had a number of powerful people warning her away from certain subjects, and if she had been a full member of the Royal family, she would have had a much harder time being so outspoken. (Just think Edward VIII had to abdicate because of pressures from within the Royal Family, government and media. The world has changed since then, in terms of standards and morals, but the powers at play almost certainly haven't. It is said that Charles Was pressured into not marrying Camilla for the same reason as Edward).

The Royal Family, as ironic as it may seem, have very little power for anything. Big Brother contestants have more power, since they are not restricted in what they say or do. The Royals get to meet very important people, they get to give them lots of wine and food, and they get to put their name to things, however they are extremely impotent in helping any major problems; they simply are not allowed. And any Royal who thinks they can do what they want would surely have it sternly explained to them that they can't.

Who does have real power though? Businesses, governments. If a few of the governments of earth wanted to make some real changes, they probably could. If the major businesses wanted to change the world, they definately could. But they wont. There's no profit to be had in keeping african's healthy. There's no incentive for governments to overthrow tyrranical regimes (think anyone's going to put one military foot in Africa after the fuck up that Iraq was?).

Like you say, as humans we have the resources to help each other out and live in a fair world. And we should, we bloody should and like you it sickens me that we don't. But the world isn't run by people, it's run by boardrooms of people whose jobs are to make as much profit for the company as possible, because our society is based upon profit within competitive markets. If it was run by the Queen, who employed scientists to invent cures for diseases and crops which grow in the desert, and was not driven by profit, rather improving the world; we'd see the end of famine and malaria. However: the Queen is just an old woman who can do no more than sponsor charities and keep away from the work of politicians; scientists work for businesses who fund their research, governements work for taxes (which they get from the businesses), and businesses work for growth and profit

These kind of caps work right up until the point when they run into reality. For example are you going to literally cap a family with five kids so they cannot afford to feed those kids or throw them out on the street because the London rent is too high? No. You aren't.    

This entire issue is being solved in a political way instead of a workable way. The workable way however involves years of planning, legislation, and most important a link between tax and benefits. Unfortunately that doesn't sound as good when a spin-doctor says it.   

If you want a good over-night solution, then just literally hard cap rents. But then make it only possible to evict someone when the council have lined up a cheaper rental place of residence. Boom, a nice-sounding, but workable solution which the tabloids can fap over.

They are already faced with making cuts and increasing rents just to maintain operational expenses. 

As for the private landlords leasing to the social sector, that will face a huge change as housing benefit will no longer be paid to the landlords directly, it will be given to the tenants who will then have to make the payments themselves. This, combined with under-occupancy reductions in HB will make renting to the social sector far less enticing to the private sector as they will get less money and are more likely to face tenants in arrears. If they do decide to get out of the buy to let market, they will most likely just sell up before it's repossessed. And if it is repossessed then it becomes property of the bank, and so far they can sell it to anyone they like.

I think if we'd advanced to the late stages of either competition Harry would have taken it very seriously, and would have fielded full-strength teams, as he no doubt will if we reach the late stages of the FA Cup.  But for the early stages he *had* to field weakened sides and hope they were good enough.  It's what every other big team in the Carling Cup does as well, and it certainly cost Manchester United also, but if they had another chance I'm sure they'd do it again.  If you're playing Crystal Palace in the Carling Cup or Shamrock Rovers in the Europa League, you save your strength for the Prem.  I don't see another way to handle it.

Champions League qualification might not be the kind of glory we want, but it *is* the kind of glory that can secure our status as a permanent rival to the big four.  Non-league trophies are not.  If we win the FA cup this year but finish 7th, Modric and Bale are out the door by mid-July, along with any chance of luring decent replacements and tens of millions of pounds in potential earnings.  I would find silverware cold comfort after we were restored to a permanent position in the midtable, to be pityingly referred to as ""another Everton"" or ""another Aston Villa.""

There has arguably been no time in the club's history when continued Champions League qualification is more important to its future.  With that in mind I'd hate to have seen Harry prioritize *anything* but the league campaign.  We've set our sights very high indeed - we're acting like a club that's above the Carling Cup because we *want* to be a club that's above the Carling Cup.

true,Antagony,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire Pudding,"&gt;I'll leave it open to debate as to whether it's ever justifiable to murder an innocent if that would prevent the death of a large number of innocents.

I find the ethical implications of such hypothetical situations absolutely fascinating. Consider this scenario:

* An out of control tram is barrelling down a track
* There is a fork in the track and you are stood next to the switch that controls it.
* If you don't throw switch, a group of workmen down that line will all be killed.
* If you *do* throw the switch, only one workman down the other line will be killed.

Should you throw the switch?

Most people answer ""yes"" to this, justifying it with the Spock-like logic *""the needs of the many outweigh the needs on the one!""*

However, change the scenario slightly and things become decidedly less clear:

* An out of control tram car is barrelling down a track
* There are a number of workmen down the line that will be all be killed unless something is done.
* You are stood on a bridge over the line with a very fat man stood next to you. 
* If you push this man off the bridge into the path of the oncoming tram, he will be killed but the tram will be derailed and the workmen will be saved.

Should you push the fat man off the bridge?

Most people say ""no"" to this because it *feels* wrong. But is there really any difference between the two decisions? Don't they boil down to the same thing: choosing whether or not to kill one person to save a group of people?

He gets an extremely low basic salary.

This is a payment in shares, so if the company doesn't do well over the next 2-3 years, they will be worthless.


We need to have someone good in his position, as we want RBS to do well, make money, and return our stake. If we don't pay well, we are not going to attract anyone half decent to this position.

However, though we may not like to admit it there are plenty of people who abuse the system.

My husband and I both work full time (I am a nurse and he works in IT) and would love to have a big family but simply couldn't afford it. Obviously no one wants to see families living in poverty but it troubles me that some people keep popping out kids with no intention of providing for them as they assume they will be taken care of by the state. As for housing benefit being capped, I feel uncomfortable with the idea of people being forced out of their homes due to a cap on housing benefit but at the same time, i'm not sure that anyone has a 'right' to live in an expensive location. We would love to live in a nicer area but our choice of location is obviously restricted by our income. Surely it's not unreasonable for someone who doesn't work to face the same restrictions?

Northern Ireland has pretty much a different accent for each town.  It will probably take some getting used to, as we talk fast and tend to use a lot of slang words, with some borrowed from Gaelic.  An example would be ""craic"" (pronounced crack) which basically means ""fun"" or ""happening.""  So if someone says ""it was great craic!""  Interpret that as ""it was great fun!""  Or if someone says ""what's the craic with you?""  Interpret that as ""what's happening with you?""  However, once we realise you're not from here, most of us will try to speak clearer and use less colloquialisms so don't worry.

As far as our humour goes, we tend to have a very dark, caustic, sense of humour with plenty of sarcasm and pessimism... which is odd, considering most of us tend to be quite friendly and open.  Don a thick skin, and realise we're not trying to offend you and you'll be grand.  

Obviously Northern Ireland has had a pretty messed up past, but things have mostly calmed down.  Most of us don't care enough any more with the younger generation adopting a ""live and let live"" attitude.  There is a rogue element of the IRA still active, but they have very little popular support and do not have the ability to carry out bombings and killings *en masse* like the Provisional IRA did.  But, on the whole, Northern Ireland is incredibly peaceful with one of the [lowest crime rates in Europe. ](http://wikitravel.org/en/Northern_Ireland#Stay_safe)

Organic farming is about cultivating a healthy, fertile soil, encouraging farmers to work with nature rather than against it, which means lower energy inputs than intensive farming and a higher level of micro-nutrients in the food produced.

By using organic alternatives to fossil-fuel based fertilizers organic farmers are less susceptible to shortages in these finite resources.

By avoiding the widespread use of antibiotics in livestock organic farms reduce the spread of resistant bacteria.

Don't get me wrong, he is slowly improving, but I'd like to see the Charlie Adam that started last season with Blackpool, the Adam that totally dominated us when they came to Anfield, who can whip in balls, beat the first man from crosses and corners, who can blast in a 30 yard screamer from open play or a deadball situation. 

Hopefully that'll come, maybe when we get Lucas fit (Spearing in the short term) he'll do all the 'dirty' defensive work, which will free Adam up a bit to go forward and we can get the best out of him.

My absolute favorite character of all time was when the actress that played moaning myrtle from harry potter (I don't know her name) was searching out for the doctor with this cool little club she made.  They were very clever and organized and kept up with sightings of him all the while some monster was eating them one by one and absorbing them into his giant sticky belly.  By the end of the episode she too had been absorbed until the doctor rescued her.  But he wasn't able to save all of her.  In fact, all he could save was her face, in the shape of a square stepping stone.  Apparently, good fortune to her, the boy she liked throughout the episode didn't seem to mind her as a face and they kissed and carried on with their relationship.  After having been flabbergasted at the end result and happy that the two love birds finally got together; my brain started to pick apart this lovey-dovey ending with questions as to where their relationship was going (she being only a head essentially.)  One can only guess their...uh...recreational time is severely limited, but daily functions and overall lack of ability to get out and live a life...I'm rambling now, but anyway, I feel the most remorse for her because although she is alive, she very much got jibbed by the Dr. in only saving her face - what sort of life is that??

As well as Scumdee it's also known as Fundee, this tends to be due to the high concentration of drinking establishments in the area as well as the fact there are 2 universities sharing the same small city. The night life is pretty damn good (and cheap). 

As for whether you'll get stabbed, I never had any trouble at all and for my final year I lived in what was supposedly one of the rough areas (Hilltown if you're wondering). 

Rental prices were fairly low (compared to other Uni towns) but they were rising while I was there so I can't comment on how much they are now.

Most importantly the University is good. Top class life sciences and architecture labs. The Physics department wasn't the greatest I have to admit but I did help set up the nanotechnology lab as part of my dissertation before I left, so it was getting better. The Uni library is good, I spent most of my final year pretty much living in there or in Labs.

Hope this helps

While there are injustices in corporate tax shenanigans, nom-doms, reduced council tax etc over half of tax revenue from income tax, national insurance and vat; most of which will be from the 99%.

The expenditure seems mostly to be NHS and social protection/housing; eg benefits..

What would you think if the headlines about Maxwell had said ""the Jew Robert Maxwell stole pensioners money to maintain his wealth"". Or ""Jew Gerald Ratner said that people who bought his 'crap' jewelry were idiots"". 

Nothing is false there. Every word is true. But putting them together like that - well, are you comfortable with it?

This is what happened with Jews in 1930's Germany. Whenever a Jew committed a crime his religion would be mentioned, as if that was the reason. And right now it is being done to Muslims for exactly the same reason. 

This man didn't commit his crimes because of his religion - he did them because he is a predatory monster. At NO POINT during his trial did he say that he committed his crimes for religion - his religion was  brought  up in his defence (""I am a religious man, why would I do this?""), not as part of the prosecution case.

The gutter press (and, if you do a google search places like stormfront, good company you are keeping) have manufactured this story to sell papers to people like you, people who are buying in to the ""drip drip drip"" against Muslims that is going on right now. I'll say it again - how would you feel if whenever Jew committed a crime that was part of the headline against them?

This ""drip drip drip"" against Muslims is going on for exactly the same reason as the ""drip drip drip"" against Jews went on in the 1930s in Germany. It is to dehumanise them in your eyes because oil is running out and there is rather a lot of it under Arab soil, and we are going to have to kill rather a lot of them to get hold of it. Better that you think them worthy of slaughter.

By the way, from your comment you are either a deluded idiot or an out and out anti-Islamic racist. He did this becuse he is a rapist, and if you think that somebody can be turned into a rapist JUST BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGION - as you apparently do - you are either utterly clueless (that wasn't part of the prosecution case) or, since I will give you the benefit of the doubt for not being a total idiot, an utter Islamophobe. Either way I don't think you will gain anything by continuing this discussion.

Oddly you seem to understand that rather than Catholicism turning people into paedophiles, it was the case that paedophiles infiltrated and corrupted the institutions of the Catholic Church.

well there's the issue. Clearly you don't understand democracy if you're resorting to dictionary definition. A sure sign you don't really understand what you're talking about. ""Democracy"" is just greek for ""of the people"" (rough translation) meaning the people affect government. Think of the myriad complex different ways in which different nations go about this.

&gt;I remain unconvinced in anything you've said so far.

I'm not trying to convince you. Ignorance isn't reasoned into people and it can't be reasoned out. You just have to realise by yourself. I just hope others may read this and agree.

Be honest. You don't even know what the house of lords is, do you.

true,JRugman,null,null,"First of all, the article you linked to relates to organic food in the US. This is r/unitedkingdom - organic standards are different in the UK than they are in the US. Organic certification in the UK is provided by the Soil Association, which has been established since the 1940s, and is the most rigorous organic certification standard in the world.

Lets take a look at the points raised in the article:

* *Buying organic food benefits small farmers, and represents a blow to the big food corporations.*

First of all, this isn't a claim being made by any credible advocates of organic farming. The main social benefit comes from the fact that organic farming tends to be more labour intensive, which helps rural economies more than intesive, mechanised farming. That said, when it comes to growing, switching to organic does make it easier for small farms to compete with large corporate farms because there are fewer benefits to be had from economies of scale. 

* *Organic foods are healthier to eat*

The FSA brought out a report in 2009 that said that generally, there are no nutritional differences between organic and non-organic produce. But this report ignored a major European study that came out around the same time that concluded that ""Levels of a range of nutritionally desirable compounds (e.g. antioxidants, vitamins, glycosinolates) were shown to be higher in organic crops"", and ""Levels of nutritionally undesirable compounds (e.g. mycotoxins, glycoalkaloids, Cadmium and Nickel) were shown to be lower in organic crops"". Some foods show big differences - eggs and milk have significantly higher levels of CLA and omega 3. The article you linked to states that different farming methods have no impact on the nutritional value a particular plant being grown because there's no genetic difference. But this ignores the way plants draw nutrients from the soil as they grow, and organic soil has much higher levels of micronutrients essential to plant development than intensively farmed soil.

* *Organic growing methods are better for the environment*

This is absolutely not bullshit. Organic farming encourages a holistic approach, where biodiversity and careful crop management are used instead of widespread application of chemical inputs. Two major environmental concerns in the UK are fertilizer run-off leading to eutrophication of water courses, and soil degradation. Organic farming addresses both of those problems. It also has much lower carbon emissions than conventional farming, as it doesn't use fossil-fuel based fertilizers or pesticides, and the healthier soil locks in more carbon.

As far as yields go, there are lots of different figures out there. When comparing the big staple crops - wheat, soy, potatoes, etc - organic yields are lower, but the difference is far less when comparing fruit and veg. What's missing is a recognition that if we're going to switch to a more environmentally friendly diet, we're going to need to eat more fruit and veg, so the lower yields won't be that big a deal.

And I don't get where your claim that organic farming is non-sustainable is coming from. You've got that completely the wrong way around. It's the fossil-fuel dependent industrial farming that currently produces the vast majority of our food that is inherently unsustainable.

It's been retconned before that the additional faces seen in his fight with the Meddling Monk that the other faces were the past regenerations of the Monk, not the Doctor. 

As for the 11th Doctor not appearing to have aged - well, ask Moffat. It's also established that Timelords don't age at the same rate as humans - I believe the first Doctor was at least ~300-400 years old at the time of his regeneration.  As I have seen it explained, Timelords undergo some physical changes during their first regeneration, such as growing a second heart. River also made a comment in Let's Kill Hitler about slowly de-aging herself to freak people out, which suggests that Timelords have the ability to control the rate at which they age. That could be one of the additional changes that show up after their first regeneration.

As for transferring regeneration energy, particularly the energy from River to the Doctor... it was said that she used up all her future regenerations. She didn't pass these regenerations to the Doctor, like giving him extra lives, but she burnt up all the energy in order to prevent him from dying. That doesn't go against the idea that the rule of 12 was enforced by Timelords and that the energy a Timelord has to regenerate can last beyond the 12 that they were restricted to. 

I think in the case of the hand in the jar, it has a lot to do with how that hand got lopped off shortly after regeneration, meaning it probably still held a lot of that regeneration energy. I'd have to rewatch the End of Time to really comment about how they brought the master back from his ring, since I haven't seen it since it aired. I think, though, that since Gallifrey isn't so much destroyed as it's timelocked, any energy that was present there is still traopped there.

Fixed, established things must still happen, it's why the time lords were able to use the Master to escape the time lock. If Susan was dropped of by River, then she must still go to see him. Because it's something that did happen.

Otherwise, how does any doctor carry on about their business? The tenth met the fifth, and he didn't complain about a missing Gallifrey.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"First thing you do? Watch Genesis of the Daleks. then a quick rundown for the best stories of each Doctor:

William Hartnell, first- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore.

Patrick Troughton, second - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

Jon Pertwee, third- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

Tom Baker, fourth The most famous run. There are so many fantastic stories. Genesis of the Daleks, one of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic. And Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

Peter Davison, fifth -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special, andCaves of Androzani!* (the last story)

Colin Baker, sixth- His Doctor is unique with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good.

Sylvester McCoy, seventh. Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis.

Downing too really proved himself to have some potential too.  He looked like he owned the left wing all game, and at one point looked like Suarez making his way through ~3 defenders in the box.

For that matter all our players did well, even Kuyt who has been rusty lately looked quite dangerous and it was a real shame he couldn't hit his 50th.

Apart from anything else, it looks like they were shagging in season one but only got somewhat more serious when Jack came back in season two (see: the stopwatch scene in season one, followed by the really awkward date asking in season two).  Ianto seems a bit blind-sided by the whole going-out-with-a-man side of things (see: his conversation with his sister and multiple attempts in CoE to try and define their relationship), whereas I think Jack is overly aware of Ianto's mortality (see: his offhand comments in CoE and his refusal to commit to anything specific.  I also took the 'don't' in CoE as Jack's refusal to accept that Ianto was dying and that this would be his last chance to say exactly what Ianto means to him.  Although I think that's rectified in one of the audio dramas which I still haven't managed to listen to!).

I think it's pretty hard to deny that Jack did love Ianto though, the difficulty is in pinning down exactly what that love was (see: his love for all his team to the point of bringing Owen back from the dead).  But then, a lot of the tragedy of Ianto's death comes from the fact that they were only just getting there relationship-wise and now neither of them will ever know what could have been.

Under the [Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/contents). the government now has a general statutory requirement to publish a treaty that is subject to ratification or its equivalent, and lay it before Parliament for 21 sitting days.

During those 21 days Parliament has an opportunity to vote not to ratify the treaty and the Government must make a statement as to why it should pass. Parliament votes again, rinse and repeat indefinitely.

""The Ark"" is also one of the only full episodes of the third season and also happens to be one of the best and most entertaining.

I'm a huge fan of the Second Doctor, so I'd suggest ""Tomb of the Cybermen"" for amazing old school enemies, ""The Mind Robber"" for appropriate 60's trippiness, and at least the last couple episodes of ""The War Games"" (although you should really watch the whole thing) for the first mention of the name ""Time Lord"" AND the first appearance of the Time Lord High Council, as well as a number of other interesting firsts.

The system is fundamentally flawed.  

I also think the solution is negative taxation.  Quite a simple idea.  You deduct a certain expectation of payment from your salary, and tax the remainder at a flat rate.  For some people this number will be negative so they get a tax rebate.

Or alternatively, each person gets a bursary.  When you earn *anything*, the bursary goes down but at a lower rate than your income goes up.  Something like 40p per pound earned.  the numbers work out the same so it's a question of how you look at it.

Example: Base rate considered to be £20000.  Tax rate is 40%.  Someone on £0 receives £8000 per year, someone on £10000 receives £4000 a year and pays no tax, someone on £20000 simply pays no tax, £30000 pays £4000 tax, and so on.",0,1327654976,null,0,false,0,c3l5ics,t3_oxro7,t1_c3l5ics,t3_oxro7,null,1428248656,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I'm against it because, in order to have the death penalty, we have to turn a number of people into state-sanctioned murderers.

We create a profession where killing people is about as exceptional as filling in a form or using a machine to make something. Not as a kill-or-be-killed decision, but because it's their job.

I'm against it because, with a death penalty, a murderer on the run has literally nothing to lose if they go on to murder more people. You can only be killed once, and they'll die if caught, so why not just kill anyone who sees you? Why *not* kill the officers trying to arrest you? Whereas right now, yes, 25 years is no picnic but you can at least try to better your conditions while in there.

And, will you want to give evidence against a friend or relative who killed someone, if you know that evidence could get them killed? Will you talk to the police, if you're risking anything you say leading to death of another?

1) Yes, there's backstory, but the very beginning of the episode provides enough exposition to get by. 

2) It's not very sci-fi heavy, but enough to get the point across that DW is most definitely sci-fi. 

3) It illustrates that there *ARE* consequences to changing the past, enough so they won't probably won't ask you why The Doctor doesn't just go back in time and save his race (at first anyway).

4) It's a very emotional episode; use that to your advantage. Getting people emotionally invested is a cheap (but effective) way to ensure they'll want to continue watching. ",0,1327660398,null,0,false,0,c3l5v8n,t3_oyqf0,t1_c3l5v8n,t3_oyqf0,null,1428248818,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Market cap is a fairly rough indicator of a companies value. Generally companies issue new shares either for employee stock options or to obtain funding, where they sell them on the open market.

Share price usually drops a bit with dilution for funding, but not always. The company may be oversold and the SP already undervalued, or investors may see the acquisition of funding as a step towards growth and expansion. Dilution in the case of stock options tend not to lower the price much as the alternative would be paying the employees out of the company's cash balance. It also gives employees incentive to work harder to increase the share price, which is good for other shareholders too.

Owning a lower percentage of the company won't really matter too much for the government/taxpayer, it doesn't affect our voting rights and our total number of shares owned remains the same.

The tax idea does seem slightly unfair. Owning a house should be more like having money in the bank. However, an ""empty house"" tax could be interesting. If he really wanted to make a big difference he would do something about rent (AKA once you own a surplus property you can get money for nearly nothing). For example, a law that makes most residential property rent become like paying a mortgage, the landlord can take reasonable interest on top to a limit but if you pay long enough the property should be yours or you should be able to get your money back, minus interest when you move out (like a property backed bank).

Parallel to rent being artificially inflated by benefits, house prices are artificially inflated by tax relief on mortgage interest payments. Margaret Thatcher seemed to never quite grasp the point. She seemed to think that tax relief on mortgage interest payments was purely a benefit to first time buyers.

Any subsidy results in an increase in house prices, which is beneficial for those who own two or more houses, neutral for those who own one house (I'm assuming that it is where they live and they want to stay put) and detrimental for those who own zero houses (assuming they were hoping to buy). I'm not sure why Thatcher had a hard time grasping this. Perhaps because she grew up in an era before planning controls. Where there is plenty of land, any increase in house prices leads to a boom in building and this expands supply bringing the price back down again.

Dividing things up will be expensive, and a Scottish Government would be expected to contribute to that expense. They would at least be expected to fund the dismantling of the facilities, if not the construction of replacement facilities south of the border.

Lets also not forget the other Naval issue in Scotland; the construction of the two carriers in Rosyth dockyard and the seven rusting nuclear submarines permanently stored there. 

The first carrier is due to be launched in 2015 from the Babcock assembly yard, and the second carrier in 2018. The support and maintenance facilities were also to be built there, with the carriers specifically designed to be low enough to transit under the Forth bridge. Several sections of the carriers are being built at Rosyth, and more at Govan in Glasgow.

The second carrier would plainly have to be built in Portsmouth instead; no sense in the Royal Navy maintaining shipyards and skills north of the border while closing sites in England.

This first line seems to imply that at the specified location the eleventh will fall. Whether it means his death and regeneration or a fall like the one a demons run only Moffat knows for sure. 
When no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer, A question, THE first question, hidden in plain sight from the dawn of time itself, will be asked, A question that must never be answered, 
There are many myths about creatures with the ability to force truthful answers out of people. I suggest such a creature will be there on the fields when the question is asked. Either that or the doctor will be put in a situation where him lying will have extreme consequences such as rivers death. 
And Silence MUST fall when the question is asked.**
This line if quoted correctly is odd silence must fall. Not the silence. I think this means that the alien known as the silence may be involved possibly as a means of making everyone forget the answer that no one should know. 

I also have a theory aside from this that still uses the idea of the Doctor having to tell the truth. I think it explains everything including why River ends up in prison. Basically the question is asked and to save everyone River kills the doctor forcing a regeneration. The Doctor truthfully answers the question. Doctor who? I don't know. River gets sent to prison for murder and the eleventh fell. The question answered and silence falls.

true,StruckingFuggle,null,null,"I think they showed a somewhat necessary end to his story. I think it actually continues to bear out the consequences of what happened in Midnight and Journey's End. In a way, it ""murdered"" his character, but ... isn't that part of the point of the end of a Doctor's run? Before they regenerate, they die? Except his Death wasn't just from radiation poisoning. It was a character, a personality 'death' going on, before the physical one. 

Ten could have walked away from Wilf. He could have lived for a long, long time after. But he knew - he was turning away from what made him special, what made him The Doctor, and becoming more a 'real Time Lord', similar to Rassilon, or the others who would have murdered the universe for their own glory. 

He knew he was losing touch, he was slipping, he was moving to dehumanize people (the bulk, represented the people on Midnight, who had sort of shown his ideals to be foolish, combined with lingering effects of Davros mindfucking him, the Time Lord Victorious rant from Waters of Mars) and to embrace an idea that he had a right to make decisions for the universe. 

And he still knew it was a terrible, terrible thing he was becoming. In the end, he stepped into the booth to save Wilf - but he also stepped into the booth to save himself. Like how Nine, the rageful, hate-filled genocide, had to die to reincarnate and, if not clear, at least ease his guilt over the end of the Time War. It was his honor, because in Wilf, much like with Donna, he found a reason, a person to embody, what he loved about humanity, and he could die with a glimmer of hope for them. In the end, he saved Wilf - but also committed suicide, embracing his regeneration so that Ten would not become Time Lord Victorious, and Eleven could change enough to clean his slate. 

Though, if you look at some of the Eleven episodes (e.g., Amy's Choice) a lot of the guilt still remains, and he's kind of maybe swung reactionarily away from TLV ... but at least he's alive, again, and not dying and leaving behind an animate, lifeless villain Doctor 'corpse'.

Being born in the UK does not automatically give you British citizenship.
If you were born after 31 December 1982, you will be a British citizen if either your mother or father* was either:
a British citizen when you were born
'settled' in the UK when you were born
In most cases you will be a British citizen if your mother or father* was born or naturalised in the UK.

&gt;*A note on fathers
Until July 2006, unmarried British fathers could not pass on their British nationality.
If you were born before then, your father’s British nationality will pass to you only if he was married to your mother. It does not matter if they were married before or after you were born.

Assuming his father is a ""traditional"" British citizen (didn't go through the same stuff) and that they were married at the time, it looks like he can become a British citizen.

Novels:
Right, if you want to read arc stories you will need to read: Timewyrm: Revelation, Cat's Cradle: Time's Crucible, Cat's Cradle: Witch Mark, Lungbarrow*. Not many really. 
But...if you just want some great stories:

New Adventures - Timewyrm: Exodus, Timewyrm: Revelation, Cat's Cradle: Warhead (first part of the War Trilogy), Nightshade, Love And War, Lucifer Rising, White Darkness, Birthright, Iceberg, Blood Heat, The Left-Handed Hummingbird, Conundrum, No Future, Tragedy Day, Legacy, Theatre Of War, All-Consuming Fire, Blood Harvest, First Frontier, Warlock (War: 2), Set Piece, Sanctuary, Human Nature, Original Sin, Toy Soldiers, Head Games, Just War, Warchild (War: 3), SLEEPY, Death And Diplomacy, Happy Endings, Return Of The Living Dad, Damaged Goods (RTD's Novel), So Vile A Sin, Bad Therapy, Eternity Weeps, The Room With No Doors, Lungbarrow
PDA's - The Hollow Men, Bullet Time, Relative Dementias, Heritage, The Algebra Of Ice

*Lungbarrow is very divisive among fans. If you are a person who believes that the Doctor's origins will spoil the mystery of the character than may this isn't you. I think it explains a lot but still leaves a lot open to interpretation. I loved it, it was my first Who novel. But it requires lots of background info on classic Who and the first 70 pages are confusing to read.

I hear Love and War is really good, and Human Nature (base for the series 4 2-parter) is one I really liked.

And then another story I read was The Infinity Doctors! Set on Gallifrey. It tells you a lot about Omega and how TLs discovered time travel. It's also with an unidentified incarnation of the Doctor.

The European integration I am in favour of is currently completely hypothetical. I like the freedom of travel and the ability to work within the EU but I recognise that it's been done for the benefit of businesses rather than people. I don't mind the idea of a single currency on an intellectual level but the Euro was always a bad idea without further political integration, which is unworkable for a number of practical reasons.

I'd like to see more integration between ordinary people rather than institutionally, for instance cross-border trade unions and one-member-one-vote political parties funded by members subscriptions without any large donors or businesses funding them.

If you're not in London you have little hope of making much progress but London is filled with experienced types, a lot more competition and for every political arse there's 20 sycophants to kiss it. My personal recommendation varies depending on your political allegiance. If you're Labour it's hard to be noticed unless you're in London, a member of a union or you get heavily involved at constituency/borough/county level and claw your way up that way. If you're a Tory, it's more about your dedication and who else you know, also your location can help but once again London is the better place to live. For Lib Dems they require a lot of dedication and don't offer pay for most of their entry level positions, they rely a lot on volunteers. The Labour Party is also notorious for this.

It's a very tough time to get involved but my best recommendation is to get in touch with your local party reps and join the local election campaign and then when you're confident enough, run as a candidate. Be prepared to take a lot of stick from people on the doorstep and to have your patience pushed to the very limit by sycophants and stingy twats who supervise you.

&gt;Pepe Reina named Andy Carroll as the worst trainer.

&gt;If you watch him play, he rarely closes down defenders, he just wanders in the middle of the pitch ... he is rarely making runs into the box, he just jogs his way there.

Admittedly, I didn't watch a lot of Newcastle football last season aside from the time Carroll played us and aside from the Carroll highlights. But did we (Dalglish; Comolli) just completely miss all these negatives illustrated above? Or is it just that Carroll simply does not fit into the way we run our attack (as evidenced by the fact that we generally look better when Carroll is off the pitch)?

Or... is this just a case of an inexperienced 23 year old who is having a hard time adjusting to a different style of offense 'cause he only knows how to play one way?

Ultimately, though, this really - as eternalrival suggested - does seem like a panic move that just didn't work out for us.

As to 'are they in continuity' - that depends on who you ask. There's no official continuity endorsed by the BBC, so it's basically 'whatever you want to be'. Personally, I think with a show about a time traveller who's constantly meddling in all corners of the universe, there's enough room for even contradictory canon to stand side by side. So to my mind, Human Nature happened twice, once to the seventh doctor, once to the tenth; his history just changes as it goes along. That's why there's three versions of Atlantis in the TV series alone; that's why we've had two major time wars and Gallifrey has been destroyed twice (not including the eight backup versions of Gallifrey).

You can even buy DAY travelcards, if you really want to. But they are the same price as the Oyster daily caps, so, just use pre-pay.

If you only use Rail travel, check out National Rail for their [season ticket calculator](http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/seasonticket/search). Some lines can be cheaper than using Oyster / Travelcard combo.

No. Upon independence everyone who is legally resident in Scotland or who was born in Scotland, or who has parents  born in Scotland automatically becomes a Scottish citizen (according to the SNP's proposed constitution).

British nationality law does not require the renunciation of other citizenships in order to hold British citizenship. Any British citizen can hold dual citizenship. So everyone in Scotland who is born before independence would still be a British citizen, and the children of these citizens who are born after independence would be British citizens by descent, after which British citizenship in Scotland would eventually die out.

And for that matter, the Doctor and the Master never met out of order either; each encounter ran sequentially after the last. There was none of this timey-wimey River Song stuff going on; presumably both their TARDISes run on the same clock too. Or something. ;)

&gt;There are yet no player will go to Liverpool and the closer the January transfer will be closed, more and more &gt;rumors of new players will get to Liverpool. Here are some players that are now hot linked to a move to &gt;Liverpool.
&gt;
&gt;Edison Cavani, Napoli
&gt;
&gt;Liverpool manager Kenny Daglish put the striker. Now Chelsea and Man City are also keen to get it. Probably £ &gt;30-40 million. Please Kenny, get him before he went to another club. Or worst of all, Suarez will be sold to Real &gt;Madrid and Liverpool will buy 2 strikers again include Cavani. (The case of Torres but there was no reason why &gt;he want to Liverpool) Best Buy really ni if ​​so.
&gt;
&gt;Ezquiel Lavezzi, Napoli
&gt;
&gt;He has received the attention of Liverpool scouts over the past year. May be interested in getting him to give &gt;rivals the other strikers. Rumours also says Damien Commoli are trying to get Cavani and Lavezzi Lavezzi Ezquiel &gt;for £ 60 million. A new record but do not see happening.
&gt;
&gt;David Teixera, Groningen
&gt;
&gt;Latest news: He did not attend the training session two days ago. Is said to cause health problems, but seen &gt;off to get to Liverpool. Hmm maybe he want to see the game come tomorrow coat. Young players might not like &gt;him ni will always have a place directly into the squad. Whether he will succeed or not, have to wait for time.
&gt;
&gt;Mauricio Isla, Udinese
&gt;
&gt;It is said the Reds were making £ 15 million bid was rejected. Not sure they will renew the bids. He can play in &gt;the middle and back full defense. Kenny Daglish keen to get him and he looks satisfied with Udinese. Hmm &gt;Udinese now ranked no 3 Seria A competing to be champions. Not likely to Liverpool now but will return after &gt;the season finished.
&gt;
&gt;Pablo Hernandez, Valencia
&gt;
&gt;Posted Valencia winger will strengthen the right side of his Liverpol if successful get. Henderson is most &gt;effective if played in the middle, while Kuyt was not effective. He and Downing can play on both sides of the &gt;wings that can make a pass and score goals. Purchase good.
&gt;
&gt;Alexandre Helb, Wolsburg
&gt;
&gt;Err is always injured and not great as before. Takmo
&gt;
&gt;Nikica Jelavic, Rangers
&gt;
&gt;Not going to happen, going to West Ham coat.
&gt;
&gt;Fernando Torres, Chelsea
&gt;
&gt;Torres rumored to be returning to Liverpool again. His family did not like living in London and they missed was in &gt;Liverpool. He will make a transfer request to return to Liverpool.

This is probably what I dislike about him the most. He is fucking lazy. Watch Suarez, Bellamy or even Kuyt; when the opposition is in possession, you can be sure one of those guys will be relentlessly chasing the ball all over the midfield. I would bet anyone here a tenner right now that one of those three have the highest ""average miles travelled per match"" statistic at our club this season.  
  
Carroll on the other hand, just stands there until Gerrard or Adam plays a ball to his head -- and even then he just loses out to a defender and falls over. **Case in point:** Once he came on against City in the final minutes the other night, Bellamy and Kuyt had all been taken off so he was alone at the top. There was one particular instance where Joe Hart had the ball and he was able to walk it almost to the half-way line (at least three quarters up his half of the pitch) *and Carroll just fucking let him!* This is a pair of fresh legs we're talking about here; he hadn't been on the field for 5 minutes and he was standing around the half-way line.

I'm not poo-pooing what you are saying and of course you are right that England could hurt Scotland in an extreme example, etc.

Saying that, Scotland would definitely have to apply on its own behalf to join the EU and unless it got some kind of exemption as a country new to statehood it's also a definite requirement that they join the EURO along with the EU membership now. Also, with all the other hoops you spoke of. So no, it wouldn't be automatic acceptance of Scotland, mainly due to the fiscal requirements of the EURO and the political wrangling domestically that this issue would throw up. That much is certain if you have been following Croatia lately, it will make more sense that they hold off, but there would be a few years of negotiations involved anyway in a best case scenario. 

The rest of the UK would just be as is in the EU, only difference really would be a recalculation of the amount they contribute to the EU, reshuffling of paperwork and general ironing out of legal wringles which would become apparent when Scottish independence is settled.

Anyway, lets not twist ourselves into knots thinking too much about all this. Although, it's been nice talking about it with you guys and gals here.

Peace and love!

You have to remember that he wasn't very well known when he went out on loan from Palermo - he was available for 22M euro at the time with a wage of only 20k.

Chelsea, City and ManU have all been scouting him the past year - and he would easily get £120-150k at one of those clubs, so I doubt we can sign him.

The only way I can see us signing him is if the Uruguay link works, Chelsea and City have for some reason lost interest and he is willing to accept £90-100k with us. Might happen, but the chances are low.

Do you suppose the vast majority of those watching would just stop watching the programs they most enjoy? No, I'm pretty sure most of them would switch to watching TV on the aerial if Sky no longer carried them? 

And what Sky got away with omitting eight years ago – when their subscription base was relatively tiny – doesn't really have any bearing on what they can get away with omitting now. I seriously doubt they would want to lose the terrestrial channels and risk losing a large proportion of subscribers as a consequence. 

But anyway, I think we're probably just going to have to agree to disagree on this one. Neither one of us has any way of proving which outfit needs the other the most. Although it's worth noting that most of the developed world imposes a ""must carry"" obligation for PBS channels on all of the leading broadcast platforms, but only in Britain do the PBS broadcasters have to pay for the privilege. In the USA satellite and cable companies cannot drop local PBS stations but the local PBS stations are allowed to withdraw from them as part of their bargaining powers. Consequently, the platforms have to negotiate with broadcasters to carry their content and they invariably PAY for it. **[Source (PDF)](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/reports/pdf/RetransmissionandAccessChargesReview.pdf)**",0,1327759588,null,0,false,0,c3li75w,t3_p0d8v,t1_c3li75w,t1_c3li204,null,1428254700,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Fare's are £1.30 to go anywhere within the city on Lothian Buses, with various passes and things for frequent travellers. 

Can't comment on HW campuses (though most unis often offer some dedicated provision for post grads). Georgie is a relatively cheap area for renting, with quite a lot of HW &amp; Napier students. Similar around Tollcross, though really there's shared flats just about everywhere depending on your budget (again, do check bus route plan though).

Edinburgh has a *lot* of students, including postgrads, and they just about all share. Actually most people do share until they earn enough, though sharing with non-students can be problematic due to the way council tax is reduced for students.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Every other public service broadcaster in the world gets paid for their valuable content by satellite and cable companies, but here in Britain it's the other way around!

Sky pays channels that agree to become part of their channel packages. Discovery, Gold, Dave, etc will all get a tiny amount per subscriber from Sky - which is also why they all show adverts, because Sky alone isn't enough. Virgin probably does the same.

The BBC doesn't get any money because they are a free service (not funded by Sky subscribers). Until the BBC loses the TV licence it isn't going to become one of those Sky-funded channels. 

I don't understand why Sky should pay the BBC just for being there. Their subscribers don't subscribe on the basis that the BBC is available there, and Sky generally doesn't sell their packages on that basis. Maybe the BBC should get free/discounted pricing for the services they pay Sky for (although where do you draw the line, should ITV/4/5 get them too?) but there's no way Sky should be paying the BBC.

ITV doesn't get paid either (for ITV1 at least) - and for many years ITV was not even transmitted on Sky (they were on the programme guide but all you got was a message to tune your TV to channel 3).

Yes they would, so it would have no effect on Sky's subscribers - Sky could lose the BBC and the subscribers that want to will still get all channels they used to! the viewers will just be peeved that they can't use Sky+ for the BBC

Because it's adding value to the Sky packages. 

Regardless of whether it's *the* basis on which people subscribe or not, it *is* a convenience to have all the usual channels on one platform. I think a lot of people would think twice about subscribing if they couldn't also get the terrestrial channels, and as has already been demonstrated in this thread, *some* people would actually [end their subscription]((http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/p0d8v/til_the_bbc_has_to_pay_bskyb_10m_of_our_licence/c3lhp33) if the BBC channels were removed.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I bet they could could force SKY to pay a few 10s of millions in return for the privilege of carrying the BBC, seeing as their net income is close to a billion.

On what basis? If anything Sky has the upper hand, they don't *need* the BBC and would probably be quite happy to say ""bye then"" if the BBC tried to do that. The BBC needs to be on Sky more so than Sky needs the BBC to be on its platform.

Then have no issue taking the BBC's money again once Ofcom/BBC Trust tell them that they're not being platform neutral by not serving Sky box owners.

Another important distinction to make that no one has said is that you don't have to be a Sky subscriber. Plenty of people use Sky boxes just to get the free channels and don't have a subscription. Used Sky boxes are a lot cheaper than Freesat boxes are and you get a few more channels compared to Freeview.

It didn't help that BSB had to use the British-invented (IIRC) MAC transmission standard (which required new expensive boxes), decided to use weird satellite antennae (the Squarial) and had to launch two satellites each with 5 transponders, but they could only use 5 transponders total with the other satellite being a backup. IIRC they had to have redundant transmission facilities too. BSB was arguably the better system on a technical basis but it was all rather expensive.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Because it's adding value to the Sky packages.

So are hundreds of channels that don't receive payment from Sky and pay Sky to be on their platform. Will you force Sky to pay them too? What about the other public service channels like ITV, Ch4/5/S4C?

People tend to get Sky because they want more than just the BBC/ITV/Channel4. Being able to watch/record those channels is a convenience, it's not added value. 

The whole charade seems like it's the ""I hate Murdoch"" agenda hitting another stage. 

You have to remember that not all Sky box owners are subscribers. A lot of people own Sky boxes but don't pay Sky a penny, because they only watch the free channels. Should Sky be paying the BBC for these people to get access to their channels?

Would you extend the requirement to Freeview too? Arqiva is the preferred contractor for the transmission of the BBC's channels on Freeview, should Arqiva be required to provide their services for free because ""this is the BBC""?

The whole idea that a commercial company should be paying a public service broadcaster, that is funded wholly from compulsory licence fees is really quite idiotic. I see no reason why Sky shouldn't be forced into providing those services for free (or at least at-cost), but the arguments for paying the BBC make no sense at all - it only works if you can restrict access to your content, which the BBC isn't allowed to do (platform neutrality), and technically would be unable to (many of the measures they could do to stop Sky box owners watching the BBC would stop Freesat users from watching it too). Those channels that *do* get paid by Sky have the option of taking their content off the platform if Sky don't want to pay up.

Carragher in DM didn't really work for me; we were dominated in the midfield after our goal in the first half. I can't wait till Spearing's back. Henderson's one-touch passing wasn't as accurate today, but his cross to Stevie was class. He certainly merits a starting spot over Adam, who wasn't too bad off the bench. Gerrard is slowly getting back to his box-to-box best, and it was great to see him freed up to make runs into the box.

Downing, for me, was impressive. Remember his run won the corner for the first goal. Maxi was pretty poor today, as was Carroll up until the last 20 minutes, at which point we saw glimpses of what he can be for us.

The BBC has had to cut channels/cut picture quality on satellite because it has to match Freeview (to meet these platform neutrality regulations).
