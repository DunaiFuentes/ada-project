true,Kalouda,null,null,"This is not ""yet another reminder to not trust the media"". Valuations, when not made explicitly public, are often guessed at by the player's wages and release clause - nobody ever shells out that amount of money, the clause is just there to ensure that bids are competitive and that other clubs offer a lot of money for the player. The clubs in the Portuguese league have a tried and trusted method of bringing in young talent (especially from Brazil) and giving them European experience and selling them on at a higher price. Clubs slap unnecessarily high release clauses on players that they think have promise, and nobody does this more than clubs like Porto or Benfica. A player's actual value is more likely to be around half the release clause value or less. The reasons we're paying so much for him are numerous.

1. He has a deal with Porto until 2016. Buying out contracts is expensive.

2. He's not even fully owned by Porto, and therefore we must buy him completely as third-party ownership is disallowed in the UK. They've also paid a lot to get 85% ownership of him as it is.

3. He's a Brazilian international.

4. We just won the Champions' League, and everyone knows we're rich anyway.

5. The media were told that his buyout clause was €100 million. There was no reason not to believe this, release clauses are normally that ridiculous. Therefore the club believed this too and made a reasonable offer, along with the reasons stated above.

And the crew could control their bracelets... But why is that better? It puts innocent people (like Amy and Rory) at terrible risk.

It's completely irresponsible and dangerous to make it rely on something you can only get from the core on the inside. 


But alright, if you want to run with an automated system, then how about this.

The Tesselecta has records on everyone, why not just make it scan new people and see if they're evil or not and punish them based on those records. This way, no bracelet issues, no leadership issues. And perhaps have an override feature implemented, just in case.

So we can't get him. And I'm 99.9% sure we won't be getting Nigel de jong.

But we might get Luuk or Siem de Jong (brothers) Which would be good because they both have a great potential. Siem is Jan's mate aswell so as someone else said on another topic, signing Vertonghen would maybe give us a better chance of signing Siem.

Anyway we still have Sandro and Parker to play in the Defensive midfield roles, and also Huddlestone who will be fit before the start of next season.

We've gotta focus on our Strikers though, because with a consistent and good finisher we can actually score more goals from all the chances we make. (Everton, QPR, Norwich, Aston villa etc.)

But the thing which will be most important is whether or not we keep Luka. Sell him for 40-50m, or keep him and sell the deadwood.

Selling him would mean we'll have to buy someone to replace him, but it won't be like for like. But that position will be dealt with after the euros

In a 4-2-3-1, both deep midfielders have to be good tacklers, plus Chelsea have typically boasted strong tackling midfielders that I find is crucial to their style and an aspect that I really like. It was apparent in Makalele, Lampard, Ballack, Essien, Mikel and so on. Based on what I've read, his aeriel abilities is not great but his tackling is decent/strong so he might fit in. 

At some level though, I'm uncomfortable taking another team reject, and that's the biggest reason I don't like it too much. Alonso/Khedira were preferred at CM and even Esteban Granero was able to play more often. If Mourinho doesn't rate him above those players, I don't see how he could have the quality here at Chelsea. I'm hearing even Coentrao was played in CM before Granero and consequently Sahin, so that's an even worse rating. I think I'd pass on him.

If someone says ""Wow, I'm certain River Song must be lactose intolerant, that's the kind of thing Moffat would do"" that is not a spoiler.

If an episode has aired in the UK before it airs in the US and someone posts ""Just saw tonight's episode, I couldn't believe the scene where Wallace and Gromit give River a piece of Wensleydale and she becomes ill due to her previously undisclosed lactose intolerance"" THAT IS A SPOILER to anyone who hasn't seen the episode yet.

If an episode hasn't aired for the public but some website attends a press screening and posts a review which says ""River's revenge on Wallace and Gromit for feeding her a piece of cheese and causing her tummy distress is a highlight of the episode"" THAT IS A SPOILER.  

If Alex Kingston gives an interview and says ""There's a scene coming up in a future episode...I can't say too much, but a certain man and dog get to see a darker side of River, I enjoyed playing it"" most people would not consider that a spoiler, but if they posted a link to it they might say something like ""Alex discusses an upcoming plot point in this interview, no major spoilers but skip it if you don't want to know anything at all.""

I went to a Sting concert the night of my surgery.  I had massive halos, the shields on PLUS the granny wrap around sunglasses, plus a hood up.  I had no depth perception, so I held onto my husband.  I cannot imagine what I looked like to others.

However, I pulled the shield up to look at Sting during the concert and WOW.  No glasses, no contacts, I could see him clearly.  Then a fight broke out (not involving us, but in the row in front).

Nearly 12 years later I'm still 20/20.  

For me, I'm actually cash flow positive on it at this point.  I needed weighted contacts, so they were $300 a year, plus the exam, plus the supplies.  I could usually only use a prescription for a year, so I did need new ones the next year, and I couldn't get cheap ones or the ones you could sleep in.

The Contractor Meal Ordering System (CMOS) is an external website developed by LOCOG to allow all companies 
whose staff are not LOCOG paid or volunteer staff the ability to order meals to be consumed on venue.
Key CMOS information 

 ALL personnel who are not LOCOG paid or volunteer staff need to be catered for through the Contractor Meal 
Ordering Programme and use CMOS to order vouchers to secure meals at venue

 Meals will not be allowed to be brought onto venue and general public concessions will not be available to 
contractors to buy meals

 This applies to contractors and sponsors who are not paying for their meals directly. These companies will 
need to invoice LOCOG back once they have received the invoice for vouchers

 The price per meal is £10.00, exclusive of VAT, and is the same for all meal periods at all venues being 
served. LOCOG has worked out the price based on a „cost-recovery‟ model, with no mark-up or margin to 
LOCOG for providing this service

I don't like calling this poaching, makes it sound like we're going against the King's law or something. It's natural for managers to want to bring in players who they know work within their system, and in this case they should come cheap too, which is a bonus. 

Gylfi is good in that he can also be played on the flanks. He seems ready to follow Rodgers, isn't expensive, and looks plenty versatile enough. 

Are all footballers named Dyer naturally fast? The trouble with this kid is that he feels like a big fish in a small pond. He feels a little 1 dimensional and I could live without him. 

Will Allen turn out to be another Wee Jay? His size worries me, he's shorter than me and I'm 3/4 Asian! He hasn't seemed as impressive in the Premier League as he had been in the Championship, and that is the main worry. We want to get players who are better than the average Premiership player, not those who are better than the average Championship player. His age is an obvious plus point, but he also has a little history with injuries which may hamper further development. 

Vorm is the main enigma. It's about time for us to consider a replacement for Reina, but Vorm will want to start games. It is my opinion that we should let him stay wherever he is and continue to gain first team experience. He is 28, which means he wouldn't want to stick around waiting for Reina, who is only a year older. 

In the end, I'd only take Gylfi, whom I believe is a rare talent. I also think that Rodgers will be looking for all-rounders rather than specialists, because that's what he needs to play the Barcelona 3-4-3 style. You can't find another Xavi, and I doubt Rodgers wants to, I think he is looking for players who have a little Xavi in them. Lucas will become the absolute focus for us if I'm right.

I get what you're saying... I wouldn't be overly thrilled or disappointed with any of these signings but I at least think Sigurdsson, Allen and Dyer are worth considering.  I think we may need a few specialists at first, unless Rodgers plays a little loose with his preferred system for a while.  Allen's height may be a problem but I don't think he would be a replacement for Lucas, like Spearing was.  He would more likely be a passing option alongside Lucas.

Lucas actually worries me in Rodgers system.  At least he does if it is as close to Barca's system as people say (I have only seen 6-10 Swansea games).  At Barca it is the one position where they care about height.  That's why Busquets was converted from a defender into that position and Mascherano went the other way.  When the wings push up the DM splits the defenders and covers any crosses that might come in from the vacated wide areas.  If you took Agger and Lucas and put them at Barca they would probably have their positions switched, too.  On the plus side, he isn't a dirty cheat or a diver like Busquets.",0,1338529915,null,0,false,0,c4uuzyc,t3_uf0bz,t1_c4uuzyc,t1_c4uuoi1,null,1429043822,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

I think it added about $7k by the time you figure in the pre-op exam, chest x-ray, anesthesiologist, recovery, time in the OR, etc.

You might find a doctor who would do it under deep sedation, similar to what an oral surgeon would use, which would be a cheaper alternative to general anesthesia. General is the only type of sedation that will have a paralytic effect on the eye muscles, though, so if your concern is something like nystagmus and not just ""I don't want to be awake for this"" your options are limited.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"3-4-3 is just a number, its the actual playstyle that matters. I could call it 4-3-3 and it'd still be the exact same team. Barcelona found mixed success with it because Puyol is old, Pique was off his form and Mascherano isn't really that suited to be a centre-back. Also, Guardiola is a little rigid in his tactics that he refuses to change his style no matter who he plays. You can take the 3-4-3 formation, and instead of playing the Barcelona passing style, take advantage of the additional width and play counter-attack down the wings. Most importantly, you need a solid striker in this formation. Barcelona lost Villa and you could see how Sanchez was totally not suitable to be the sole striker in the formation. 

There's a chance for every single player to be a ""big fish in a small pond"", there are so many conditions to look at. Adam is a good example. He is a far cry from when he was in Blackpool, because in Blackpool he was the main star. His team's defense was built to back him up, the attack was being dictated by him, basically he commanded the team on the pitch. In Liverpool, he is one of many players, many of them better than he is. He can't command players to run onto his long passes anymore, because they can sometimes be running into space that he didn't see. It was a fish out of water situation, because we changed everything about him except his name and the area he played in. Sigurdsson will be a better gamble simply because he is a ""veteran"" of Rodger's system. If Rodgers buys him, he will obviously know how to fit Gylfi into his plans.

So you get an amalgamated figure for pay and pensions as a percentage of GDP, and use this to argue against certain policy changes for pensions. This is like quoting the total GDP figure as an estimate for the size of the manufacturing sector, and using that to criticize government industrial policy. Why not quote the actual relevant data?

&gt; I say ""trying"" because, according to Govt's own Hutton report, long term costs will come back under control.

As far as I can tell, you're using the calculations for what will happen after reforms are put in place, to argue that those same reforms are unnecessary.

&gt; Who said this post was about pension liabilities (long term future costs)?

To my mind 'Are pension costs ballooning out of control' is a direct reference to long term pension costs.

I applaud your aims, picking through and making these reports accessible is really important work. But I am a complete amateur, and the two times these articles have been posted, there seem to have been these odd errors or omissions that pop out. And it's not like you're being hesitant about the conclusions you're drawing.

true,PeterBrett,scot-Lothian,Lothian,"&gt; Actually, Chernobyl happened because of an accidental power surge.

A ""power surge"" was the proximate reason the reactor core melted down, but describing it as the cause of the disaster indicates that you have no idea what you're talking about. The Chernobyl disaster happened due to the critical coincidence of a large number of different factors, related to:

* The design of the reactor (graphite moderator, dangerously large positive void coefficient at low power levels, poor design of control rods that led to power input initially *increasing* when inserting rods, poor containment systems)
* Poor understanding of reactor physics and conditions inside the reactor (in particular, xenon-135 poisoning)
* Operator errors (the experiment carried out that day, unapproved with the reactor designers, placed the reactor in a highly unstable configuration outside its design parameters, and an emergency shutdown attempt triggered the disaster)

&gt; No-one could've prevented it.

It could have easily been prevented. If the experimental protocol had been reviewed by the reactor's designers or the scientific officer at the plant, the disaster would not have occurred. The power surge was caused by an attempt to SCRAM (emergency shutdown) the reactor, inserting the (badly designed) control rods fully and thus *causing* the fatal surge. Had the SCRAM not occurred, the experiment would have been completed and the reactor returned to normal operating conditions, and the disaster would not have occurred. If the test had been carried out more slowly and during the day shift as originally planned, the unstable configuration would not have occurred due to reduced xenon-135 poisoning, and the disaster would not have occurred.

&gt; Even today, there are still an unsettling amount of risks associated with Nuclear Power.

Even today, a combination of overly pessimistic international guidelines on acceptable radiation levels and media scaremongering over risks not present with modern reactor designs makes it politically impossible to build the modern ultra-safe and fuel-efficient reactor designs, thus *increasing* the risks associated with nuclear power by requiring aging reactors to be run for longer than originally designed.",0,1338544835,null,0,false,0,c4uwk6d,t3_uds3u,t1_c4uwk6d,t1_c4unuqx,null,1429044561,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

For a start, the top fees essentially *are* unlimited already. The fees are set by the market price, not some artificial limitation. So saying ""you can charge whatever you like to rich parents"" wouldn't change a thing, since that's what private schools do already.

Also, many people who go to those schools aren't filthy rich. Lots of them have parents who save up hard or take extra jobs to send them there. One of my friends went to a £12,000/yr boarding school, but his mum was a daycare worker and his dad worked in a factory. They live in a terraced house and drive a Nissan Micra, but they saved their fucking asses off to send him there because he's a bright kid and they wanted the best for him.

Your idea simply wouldn't work. For a start, government shouldn't interfere with PRIVATE schools. There's a reason why people pay to avoid government education! Secondly, private schools want small class sizes, and forcing them to take non-paying students would either make class sizes larger, or reduce the amount of funding that the school gets from parents.

From Wikipedia:

&gt;A machine gun is a fully automatic mounted or portable firearm, usually designed to fire rounds in quick succession **from an ammunition belt or large-capacity magazine**, typically at a rate of several hundred rounds per minute.

&gt;An assault rifle is an automatic rifle that uses an **intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazine.** Assault rifles are the standard infantry weapons in most modern armies. Assault rifles are categorized **in between light machine guns, which are intended more for sustained automatic fire in a light support role**, and submachine guns, which fire a pistol cartridge rather than a rifle cartridge.

&gt;The royal family do nothing.

Wow, well there's your research into the subject summarised nicely.

&gt;I doubt anyone visits the UK just because of the Monarchy

Yeah, no countries envy us having the most famous royal family *in the world* in any way at all.

&gt;the palace could be opened fully to the public and maintained for tourism.

Ignoring the fact that this would just transfer costs instead of eliminating them, you'd still have certain types complaining about how that palace could build a dozen schools (etc.)

No, you're the guy making huge assumptions and apparently not looking for anything that might challenge them :-)

Using same 'journalism' standards I could make similar documentary showing London before the 2012 olympics. Just use Terry's racial slur footage, some West Ham or Millwall supporters brawls, maybe add some Tottenham riots and that's it. Then show it to someone who has never been to England put him in front of a camera and ask him to say if he would like to visit.

Sure, there are racist scum among football supporters, but good journalist would show the big picture, while this documentary holds rather tabloid standards.

I hope you have been paying attention to the news recently, as it has been widely reported that mobs have been gathering in city centres, and making a large ruckus.  They have been disturbing native citizens of these cities (like myself, in my native Cardiff) with these displays, forcing roads to be closed and generally making everyone's lives more difficult.

And where are the police I hear you ask?  Well, they've certainly been turning out in force to usher the main hooligans away (the ones that the mob cheers for, as they run down a main road brandishing a firey stick), yet due to rubbish response times, these areas can be unavailable to traffic for hours before they arrive, and the mob doesn't fully disperse for some time after that.  I've also seen people drinking in the streets of Britain, *before 6pm*.  Imagine!  Drinking, in Britain, *before 6pm*.  No wonder the country is going to hell.

We had riots in London earlier in the year, and we all saw how that turned out, so how long before one of these ""flame carriers"" sparks (excuse the pun, please) a fire that the police cannot put out?  No, it's time to call on the government to put a stop to this, *right now*.

true,cleanyoungbob,null,null,"&gt; *For a start, the top fees essentially are unlimited already. The fees are set by the market price, not some artificial limitation. So saying ""you can charge whatever you like to rich parents"" wouldn't change a thing, since that's what private schools do already.*

That's a misnomer - just because a price is determined by supply and demand doesn't mean it's ""essentially unlimited"", because otherwise the price of everything would be. In fact it means quite the opposite, as even Eton would lose most if not all of their students if they were to charge £3 billion per term.

What I meant was simply that there should be no artificial cap on top fees, so that if a school made less money as a result of the fee weighting (which they would) they'd be free to charge higher fees overall (which they would).     

&gt; *Also, many people who go to those schools aren't filthy rich. Lots of them have parents who save up hard or take extra jobs to send them there*

Exactly, and those are the people would benefit most from this - people from low income backgrounds who want the best education for their children. 

&gt; *For a start, government shouldn't interfere with PRIVATE schools. There's a reason why people pay to avoid government education!*

Requiring schools to set fees in a certain way doesn't make it a ""government education"", just as minimum wage legislation in the private sector doesn't make that ""government employment""; the government already regulates private education - [for example](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/1997/schedule/1/made) - and this would be no different.

&gt; *Secondly, private schools want small class sizes, and forcing them to take non-paying students would either make class sizes larger, or reduce the amount of funding that the school gets from parents.*

Or they maintain their small class sizes and push the top fees up. I think you may have misconstrued my argument here, as I believe there should be *no* requirement to take a particular number or even proportion of students from certain income brackets (as, ironically, there currently is for those top schools like Eton and Westminster as a condition of their charity status), but that entry should be entirely based on merit.  

&gt; *Also the final point is that many private schools have scholarships, bursaries and grants available already for smart people from worse backgrounds.*

Yes, but it doesn't go anywhere near far enough, and is, as mentioned above, based upon a arbitrary percentage of students rather than being any real attempt at abolishing financial disincentives. Eton for example has 150 bursary places out of around 1300 total students, so about 1/8 of their students are unable to pay the full fees; compare that with the national income distribution and the inverse is true, where only around the top tenth percentile (around £45,000 and above) would be able to afford the full fees.

And even if it can be shown that a particular individual school has made genuine, concerted efforts to equalise opportunity, there's still little or no requirement for this to happen on a wide scale, and as such the vast majority will continue to provide only a handful of bursaries.

I would love to read another script ( Hell even to see one ) written with a "" monster of the week "" that you come up with.

So he had a personal opinion - so what? The issue is whether he followed proper procedure, not how he felt personally. It's not as if he was taking bungs, and let's not forget that Vince Cable had been chucked out of the game for telling to one unconnected person that he wasn't a fan; Jeremy Hunt is now supposedly in trouble because he *was* a fan.

So, now that we've dealt with two politicians that had differing opinions, neither of which has been demonstrated to affect their judgement, can we now stop pretending the press have any idea about this sort of thing, and (even worse) stop following their lead? Because the ultimate outcome currently appears to be that we want a politician overseeing this that has no opinion on Rupert Murdoch. Good luck with that.

Even this piece itself - Hunt asks Osbourne 'oh dear, I hope we have a solution for this Cable mess', and Osbourne replies 'yes we do - it's you'. That's it. Everything else then revolves around 'well, they did text X, Y or Z Murdoch employee at this, that and the other date' - well I never, ministers communicating with the most powerful media company in the UK? Whatever next? Anyone would think that they were, er, politicians. I fail to see how this involves Osbourne being 'dragged into' the affair - he was involved in it from the start; *it's his job*.

Closer still and you have to try to pick your spot to get through the line, and you're constantly thrown off balance by the inaccuracy of your earliest estimations - the ships invariably travelling much faster than they look. The skipper's passed out after two and a half bottles of wine, and you haven't slept in twenty hours, the sea air covering your glasses in a fine crusty salt-mist and irritating your eyes, your left arm aching from fighting the weather-helm on a six-hour tack. This one's on you - make your choice.

Five blasts on a foghorn^1 lets you know you've made an error of judgement. Too close to that first ship of the second group along, or is it the second ship? Hard to tell; there are too many lights. Trying to keep calm you reach down to the throttle and open it up, she sounds like she'll blow, but you have no choice. Now your attention's full on the approaching behemoth, constantly assessing its direction and speed. Is it on a collision course? Has it just turned two degrees to starboard? If only that electronic shipping map were working. Damn you, skipper, why didn't you get it fixed last time we were in port? Never mind, you can't turn back now, you're committed. 

You can hear the waves breaking against its hull now, but you're through. Enjoy the respite, you can see the next lane and you'll have to do it all again in twenty minutes. [Is that a gap...?](http://memecrunch.com/meme/U6A/ahhh-we-meet-again/image.png)

true,lol_oopsie,null,null,"&gt;That's a misnomer - just because a price is determined by supply and demand doesn't mean it's ""essentially unlimited"", because otherwise the price of everything would be. In fact it means quite the opposite, as even Eton would lose most if not all of their students if they were to charge £3 billion per term.
What I meant was simply that there should be no artificial cap on top fees, so that if a school made less money as a result of the fee weighting (which they would) they'd be free to charge higher fees overall (which they would).

That's not exactly what I said. I'm saying that their price already *IS* unlimited essentially. i.e. there is no artificial cap on the price set by anybody apart from the market and parents willingness and ability to pay. Obviously the market imposes a limit based on what parents are willing to pay. I'm sure the school have worked out their pricing so that they can optimise income (i.e. the higher price provides more income but lowers the number of people who can afford it). So by saying ""oh they can just raise the fees on rich parents"" isn't a solution.

Not to mention that private schools aren't profit-making anyway. They are registered charities and all money goes back into the school. Yes, their teachers are paid well, but so they should be if they are the best available.

&gt;Exactly, and those are the people would benefit most from this - people from low income backgrounds who want the best education for their children.

That's fine, but these parents already have a wide spectrum of schools available at all sorts of price range. Plus the bursaries, scholarships etc.

&gt;Or they maintain their small class sizes and push the top fees up. I think you may have misconstrued my argument here, as I believe there should be no requirement to take a particular number or even proportion of students from certain income brackets (as, ironically, there currently is for those top schools like Eton and Westminster as a condition of their charity status), but that entry should be entirely based on merit.

Why should they push top fees up? Is £20,000/yr not high enough? I'm sure the school calculates their pricing carefully based on demand. Not to mention that just because someone can afford £20,000/yr doesn't mean they should have to pay more.

And my first thought about 1/8 students being on a bursary was that it's quite a high percentage! And again, I don't see why private schools *should* match society in terms of income distribution. It's a premium service that costs a lot more - and somebody has to pay that cost somewhere. The best way is a simple asking price that everybody pays to attend. Once you start to charge people based on how much you earn, it becomes unfair. There is already a state school system which provides free education for anybody who wants it. Not to mention that parents sending their kids to private school will surely be paying a lot of tax towards those state schools that they don't even use. To say ""oh well, those rich parents can just pay more"" is a terrible mentality to take. They already pay a lot, and are surely paying a fortune into the state system too.",0,1338561343,null,0,false,0,c4uyg12,t3_ue0fr,t1_c4uyg12,t1_c4uxphh,null,1429045467,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Adam dawdles on the ball too much, and often gets caught out in possesion. 

Spearing isnt a consistent enough passer when its anything more than 10 yards.

Carroll may struggle, but if he concentrates on putting the ball in the back of the net with as few touches as possible, like Jelavic, he'll do great.

Carragher if he plays may struggle to get out of the habit of hoofing.

Downing will have to grow a pair if he wants to succeed.

Otherwise every other player we have is more than capable of playing a possession passing game.

I'd imagine we'll sign a fast direct tricky winger, some one mentioned Afellay so someone similar to him. 
We defnitely need backup for lucas, and another striker. Having only 2 strikers in the whole squad is ridiculous, we need atleast 3.

I think Sterling may get quite a few games this year, hes of a similar mold to Dyer, but i'd argue with much more talent and potential.

Of Kaupthing:

&gt; Kaupthing is the UK offshoot of a big Icelandic bank, but is fairly new to the UK market so there’s little feedback on its smoothness or customer service yet. However, it is signed up to the Banking Code and crucially your first £35,000 is protected (see the Safe Savings? article) the same as all other UK banks. If you're saving any more than that, you may want to spread savings between more than one account, just to ensure full protection for every penny, so have a look at the accounts listed below.

And of IceSave:

&gt; IMPORTANT. Icesave, unlike some foreign banks (including ICICI), hasn’t chosen to be completely protected under the UK's Financial Services Compensation Scheme, and thus if, in the unlikely event that it were to go bust, getting the money back could be more difficult. See the Are Your Savings Safe? guide for a full explanation, and Martin’s Icesave safety blog.

AFAIR the site has always had such warnings about savings safety ever since I started following it (in 2006 or maybe 2007) but I haven't bothered to back to those years to check.

Anyway, it remains to be seen whether the UK taxpayer will eventually pay for the Kaupthing/Icesave collapse: the court case is ongoing.",0,1338565408,null,0,false,0,c4uz9t9,t3_ufgf8,t1_c4uz9t9,t1_c4uyuu5,null,1429045912,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

true,ghostridethewhip,null,null,"Sorry for dumping all of this on your post, but I didn't know where else to put it.

The CMs in a 4-2-3-1 are not necessarily defensive midfielders. I (and I'm sure many others) would like us to run the formation with a double pivot, meaning ideally both should be adequate defenders, but both (or at very least one) needs to have the ability to go forward. I am hoping that we don't run such a defensive, park-the-bus-and-counter squad next season, and a real double pivot would help with that tactical shift.

When we are on defense, both of them drop back and defend, but when we spring into the attack, one of the two moves forward to join the attack. The other stays back to ""hold the midfield.""

If we make one of these players an out and out defensive midfielder like Mikel, it shores up our defense but it makes the ""double"" part of the double pivot irrelevant since Mikel cannot attack. This means that in OPs formation, Lampard is always going forward in attack and always coming back in defense, while Mikel is just a defender. This means two things: Lampard is doing a lot of running (which could be a problem as he ages), and we lose a lot of attacking fluidity because only one of our midfielders is capable of attacking (making us predictable and rigid tactically).

In my opinion, it would be fantastic to have a Ramires/Lampard combo in midfield. Both are more than adequate defenders (especially Ramires-- we started so many fast breaks off of him winning the ball in dangerous positions). Lamps showed how well he can defend and distribute down the stretch in the Champions League. Most importantly, both of them will have a great ability to get forward and join the attack, hence providing us with a true ""double pivot."" This simply is not possible with Mikel in midfield, as much as I love watching him play.

Mikel should be the choice when we need to sit back and defend, or if we decide to change the formation to something that only calls for a single defensive midfielder. He slows the game down, which is great for a defensive team that needs composure in midfield, but we will not be a defensive team any more with the signings we made this summer. With quick players like Hazard and Hulk coming into the squad, we need some midfielders who can up the pace rather than shut it down. This may be a reason for the emergence of Romeu in the near future, as he can defend well, keep up the passing pace, and even get forward and shoot if need be.

Note: I don't say this because I dislike Mikel: he is a fantastic player who has come a long way, and I am constantly defending him amongst my friends and amongst people on r/soccer.

TL;DR- If we run a true double pivot, we have to have a player like Ramires in midfield instead of a player like Mikel. I think the best combination is Ramires/Lampard, but Romeu could fill in well in the future. Kinda complicated explanation, but read the above for my opinion of the tactical breakdown.

But the attraction of the history here, and also the attraction of the frustrations - to feel the club are still striving for that league title. Hopefully over the coming years that's something we can look to challenge for. Certainly not immediately, there are still a lot of improvements to be made. This is an iconic football club. It's a club that's up there with the world's great. **When you talk Liverpool Football Club you're talking Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Inter Milan, AC Milan.** It's an enormous club.

Just because we know that FSG spoke to Martinez before Rodgers doesn't mean he was the first choice. FSG could possibly have spoken to other managers, and they had already approached Rodgers (who didn't want to interview if he was just a name on a list). I think the difference is, Whelan set Martinez a 1 week deadline, and that meant Martinez had to fly out to meet FSG in Boston, hence it becoming publicised (plus Whelan blabbing on).

As for why it didn't work out - apparently FSG never offered him the job in the first place. It may possibly be that he wanted full control on the football side of things and wasn't happy with FSG's structure.

&gt; However in the press conference they said that there wouldn't be a Director of Football, this is just too confusing. Did they change their minds and why?

They've been saying for a while that they won't just appoint one person; Comolli's job will now be split into 3 different people. We'll have to wait and see exactly who they are and what the roles are, but word at the moment is that one will focus on statistics analysis, the other will be a 'technical director' (whatever that means; they might be overseeing the playing style across all levels of the club) and the third will be in charge of negotiating, contracts, etc. But we'll have to wait for more information.",0,1338571963,null,0,false,0,c4v0pbp,t3_ufdw0,t1_c4v0pbp,t1_c4uwef8,null,1429046523,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

I would argue that the turning point for Ramires's change of position was not brought on by playing poorly, but rather because of RDM coming on board as manager. Ramires is obviously a great winger, but you only have to look as far as his time at Benfica to see how he can dominate a midfield.

I totally agree that he doesn't have great distribution or touch, though. That could be a problem in midfield.

In order for an object to not be ""sucked"" towards the center of gravity, other forces must combine together to be equal and opposite Fg. On a planet's surface, an object sitting still on the surface is having 2 force vectors applied to it, Force Gravity and Force Normal. Force Normal is the force of the ground pushing the object in the opposite direction of gravity.

A planet in orbit around a black hole acts like a Space Station or Shuttle orbiting the Earth, where a minimum speed must be met in order to keep the objects in orbit.  For a shuttle around earth, it's around 17,500 mi/hr. This is the point at which the Force exerted by the shuttle to maintain that speed is equal and opposite to the Force of Gravity.

Also, technically the Doctor said to create the gravity funnel to the planet it'd need a ""power source with a (big complicated words that don't mean anything in modern science) of 6^6 every 6 seconds."" Which is actually just 6^5 (spacey units)/second, which is an expression of Power (Watts are Energy(J)/sec).

First step is to put your complaint in writing. Write to the people that owe you the money documenting how much they owe you, how many hours you worked and the deadline for receiving the money (a week will do - allowing a couple of extra days for the bank holidays coming up) State that if you don't receive the money by the deadline you will be seeking legal advice. Send the letter first class recorded delivery and keep a copy for your records. 

The fact that you don't have a written contract isn't a problem, they still legally owe you the money. 

If you don't hear anything back from them, as someone else has stated call ACAS. Their phone number is 08457 47 47 47 or have a look on their website (http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1461). They will act as a mediation service between you and the agency and will hopefully be able to get your money before taking the matter to small claims. It's in the agency's interest to pay you as they will be liable for fees if the case goes to small claims court and you win. 

Most important thing to remember is that you're legally entitled to the money. The lack of contract is irrelevant as you effectively entered into a verbal contract with is legally binding too.

Yes.

This type of advertising isn't about ""hey Visa sponsor the olympics so I'll get a Visa card"". It's about plastering the Visa name at you over and over again, hundreds and hundreds of times throughout the games. It'll be on banners and posters at the games, and possibly on tv. It may be read out occasionally. This leads to the name ""Visa"" being implanted in your head.

So next time you wanna get a credit card the name Visa will be the first one you think of. Since researching takes time that can be better spent looking at facebook for the average user, and since numbers can be confusing, people just go with that.

As it stands, she's phoning up the boss, he's making promises and forgetting about it (or someone's forgetting about it).

Firstly, if you threaten or file for small claims they know you're serious.

If you file a small claims action then they have to send someone to court to contest it, otherwise they lose by default.

This alone should be enough to get a stick put up payroll's arse and get the matter settled - *""why haven't you sorted this, yet? we're being threatened with court action over this!""*

Secondly, assuming they do turn up to small claims, small claims tends to side towards the consumer / individual / little guy and it tends to be fairly informal.

To win the case the agency has to demonstrate they paid her, or say ""we didn't pay her because she didn't work that day"". When the OP explains that the procedure was that the timesheets were filled out and handed in on the day, without a copy being made for them (the agency understandably not having brought photocopier to the site) then the magistrate is going to say ""is this true? let's see a copy of your records for who *did* work that day, then. show us a list of who worked and that her name's not on the list"". This is more work for the agency (when they could just settle for the value of the OP's labour, which might be £100) and it's certainly not worth it for them to lie in court. If the OP can find others who worked that day who can confirm that they weren't given timesheets by the agency, then her case is strengthened. If more paperwork or documentation is needed then the case will be adjourned, requiring another hearing and more wasted time for the agency.

To my knowledge the CAB doesn't represent people in small claims for employment issues but they will help you fully prepare the information you would need and will talk you through the process better than I can - they'll have people there that have been to small claims (if your adviser hasn't there'll be people that have in the building, so they can get you the information).

Home Office licenses are INCREDIBLY hard to get. A huge amount of paperwork. Inspections. Tons of documentation and proof about animal welfare. Every experiment has to be independently justified and pass an ethics panel.

Scientists don't use animals for experiments because they like torturing cuddly animals. They only use them when it's scientifically relevant and there is already supporting evidence to justify the experiment. Usually preliminary tests have been conducted on cells, or proven to work in lower animals such as zebrafish or mice. And there have to be real-life potential benefits for humans. People don't electrically shock bunnies and dogs for fun. 

And no scientists *like* animal experimentation. But at the moment, we have nothing better. There is plenty of funding into alternatives such as growing organs and artificial skin in the lab. But at the moment, scientists need to test on animals to find things out about humans.

So until you want to volunteer for testing yourself, or you ensure us that you will never use modern medicine including painkillers, antidepressants, antianxiety drugs, statins, insulin or anything else, then kindly STFU.

&gt;Constitutional monarchy (or limited monarchy) is a form of government in which a monarch acts as head of state within the parameters of a constitution, whether it be a written, **uncodified**, or blended constitution.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncodified_constitution

&gt;An uncodified or unwritten constitution is a constitution in which no single, formal document delineates the powers of a government, and the limits thereof.

.

Tom Werner: Before I talk a little about Brendan, I just want to thank again Kenny Dalglish. He was the heart and soul of Liverpool and he brought great stability to our club at a time when we most needed it and he will always have our great appreciation and thanks...

.

*At the end of the press conference*

Reporter: How do you feel following in the footsteps of an absolute legend like Kenny Dalglish? Do you think that puts extra pressure on you?

Brendan Rodgers: Again, for me i've got so much respect for the man. I will *never* replace Kenny Dalglish, that's the reality of it. I can only be Brendan Rodgers and do the very best I can for the football club, so i'm not here to jump above...this is the guy who was voted the best player in the history of Liverpool Football Club, who's a legend of a manger here, and a fantastic man. So there's not a race for me. That's a race i'm sure I would lose.

Brendan Rodgers: I suppose I first of all want to mention Kenny Dalglish, who is an incredible man. He's obviously the best player in the history of this football club and he's someone who adored Liverpool.

true,Alex1609,null,null,"&gt;You guys discussed Chelsea on a subreddit dedicated to Arsenal. If you want to engage in a discussion about Arsenal, don't talk about Chelsea.

Your logic is flawed here. We were discussing our perspectives as Arsenal fans on /r/soccer and how generally the content has degenerated into Chelsea circlejerks - we made a reference to your club as an add-on to the main issue at the hand, not a direct attack on your club. 

Which is besides the point, if we want to slam Chelsea then we should be allowed to do that unimpeded, it's the Arsenal sub-reddit, and should reflect the views of Arsenal fans alone. There are other forums for more general chat, where Chelsea fans are more than welcome to stick up for their team, but the forum specifically dedicated to Arsenal is not one of them. 

&gt;If anything, I'd say ""childish, irrelevant comments"" are ones like ""lololol Chelsea has no history and I hate them"" 

If that is the opinion of an Arsenal fan, posted to an Arsenal sub-reddit, then it is up to the Arsenal community to downvote/upvote as we see fit. To come from your board and downvote everything in support of Arsenal and post a lot of nonsense is infinitely more puerile.

&gt;There was no trolling, no childish, irrelevant comments, but it was a discussion about an issue that both clubs are involved in. Should that be forbidden? 

Nope, however that comment was very much in the minority. Most of the stuff posted amidst the flurry of downvotes was rude and unneccessary. 

You're in the wrong here and you know it.

Most of the power they retain today is notional and technical.  It would cause a major, even catastrophic constitutional crisis if it was ever independently exercised (openly).  But that's not to say that such power doesn't still exist in theory, and that it couldn't be used by anti-democratic forces either covertly or to oppose the popular will in a time when a crisis was already occurring.  We also know that Prince Charles has a reputation for being [much more interventionist already](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jul/01/alastair-campbell-tony-blair-prince-charles), and [we know he has had many opportunities to secretly exercise this power](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/oct/30/prince-charles-offered-veto-legislation).  That's not democracy, and it doesn't bode well for when he takes over the rei(g!)n(s).

----------**Gerrard**/Shelvey?---**Lucas**/*Henderson*?---*Aquilani*/Sterling?

For **Doni** and **Kuyt**, i've heard they want to move to get more playing time.  I'd rather keep both, as I think they are good value and the money spent replacing them would be better spent on strengthening the starting XI.  For the sake of simplicity, i'm going to assume we can keep them.

The question marks show the players I am uncertain will be up to the task of their place in the line-up.  **Flanagan**, **Shelvey**, **Sterling** and **Robinson** are all great prospects whom I feel have the potential to step into the starting XI in a few years time.  I include **Suso** and **Pacheco** in this evaulation but as you can see there isn't a spot for them on the bench, although **Pacheco** really needs to shine on loan for there to be a future for him at the club.  He's going to turn 22 in January.

I can't figure out a spot for **Henderson**.  I thought he had a pretty good season and could claim a spot in the starting IX of a Brendan Rodgers midfield.  He has some similarities with Lucas although I don't think he's as good at reading the play or passing.  Given time I think he could turn into a hellaciously good box to box midfielder.  Needs especially to work on his shooting.  Showed a real improvement in concentration and game sense by the end of the season. The question mark there indicates uncertainty whether he should be back up to **Lucas** or **Aquilani**. There will be a lot of gnashing of teeth over **Aquilani's** inclusion but I rate the player and I think he'd fit wonderfully in a possession side.  Don't forget he had 6 assists in only 18 games in his first season with us.  I think he's worth another chance.

**Bellamy** and **Downing** come with unique issues.  Bellamy is starting to show his age and we really shouldn't count on him to be able to play more than half of our matches and **Downing** has the ability to succeed but perhaps not the strength of character to flourish at a club in the spotlight.  Might be best to get rid but considering the loss we'd take on him I think it wiser to give him more time to settle in.  

I don't think anything needs to be said about the players bolded other than they are locked down in their respective positions, be it in the starting XI(to the left of the slash) or on the bench(to the right of the slash).  Italics are players in positions of lower priority to fix.

Looking at the starting lineup shows we have 7 strong starters and 3 strong bench players, 4 questionable starters and 3 questionable bench players.  Looking at that lineup, its obvious theres a lot of uncertainty as to how our personel will fit our new managers system.  It should be just as obvious that we have a very strong squad nonetheless.  Logically, our efforts should go towards strengthening the starting XI and not the bench.  

I'm hoping for a £40m transfer kitty.  That added to roughly £10.5m in sales brings us to ~£50m to spend. I propose signings in the following positions:
___________________________________

Striker:**Stevan Jovetic** £20m 

Attacking Midfielder:**Keisuke Honda** £13m

Central Midfielder: **Étienne Capoue** £12m

So that takes us to ~£35m net spend or £45m of the proposed £50m gross  transfer budget.  All three players would improve the starting 11.  Heres the final starting XI and bench in my mind:

-------------------Reina

Johnson----Skrtel----Agger----Enrique

-------Gerrard----Lucas----Honda

-------Suarez---Carroll---Jovetic

Bench:

Doni

Capoue

Bellamy

Henderson

Kuyt

Kelly


I realize theres only space for 5 on the bench, but its 1 in the morning.

I'm afraid not, old bean, Old Welsh is based on [Brythonic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_language_(Celtic%29).



English is energetic and enthusiastic adopter of loanwords, getting them from almost everywhere. There has never been a national academy to attempt restrict new loanwords, as there has been in many continental European countries. Consequently, English has words from literally everywhere. 

According to surveys, the percentage of modern English words derived from each language group are as follows:

- Latin (including words used only in scientific / medical / legal contexts)	≈29%
- French	≈29%
- Germanic	≈26%
- Greek	≈6%
- Others	≈10%

true,mad_disciple,null,null,"I have to question your analysis of football if you think Ramires has poor distribution, vision and touch. Since he joined the club he has been consistently the best midfielder (better overall than the inconsistent Mata this season), his tackling is good, he's  much stronger than anyone gives him credit for, he's tactically aware and has the stamina of the gods. Regardless the system played he can and does fit. Playing a shorter passing game won't detract from him at all, he adds a different dimension to it. Essentially he can be an attacking midfielder in the build up and has the speed and stamina to get back and defend counter attacks, what a great asset to ANY team! 

In terms of vision, when has he shown he has none (especially compared to Mikel)? Did you not see his goal against Barcelona? That was pure touch and vision, the running angle, the finish, it's a perfect example of where you're simply wrong! There are numerous other games where he's also shown that so consistently.

Your analysis of the game is so one dimensional, think about the overall team balance, you need the likes of Ramires to join the stars being talked about up front to the rest of the team, balancing the formation. He creates his own space on the pitch and then gives others more as a result, a vital aspect, so that's two ways his 'vision' and 'touch' are important. 

One last point, what is a 'traditional midfield role'? How is there only one? There are so many different players that have different skill sets that the idea of a 'traditional' role is antiquated. If you classify them as CM, DMC, AMC then you have to realise that Ramires is one of the best box-to-box midfielders around, that's his 'traditional' role in the Chelsea team. It's also a massive asset.

My shortlist would be something like Elm, Alba, and Martinez. I'm not sure how much he would cost, but I'd also love to see someone like Milos Krasic. That would give us competition at the back for Enrique's spot (Alba), an extra man up front (Martinez), a versatile midfielder (Elm) and a winger to play in a 4-3-3 with Suarez/Carroll/Martinez or compete with Downing for a spot.

Edit: Oh also defensive midfielder.

true,Mijolnir,welsh,Wales,"''The following are my less-than-meticulous notes to support the (not so as it turned out) bizarre notion of a Welsh Republic. I apologise now if I have made any dramatic omissions. In common with most English schoolchildren, I wasn't taught any Welsh history in school - nor Irish, either - I wonder why that was? The birth of trade unionism bad reading for schoolchildren?


Henry Vincent, an early Chartist leader and a fiery orator, issued a call to arms in April 1839:
""...I could not help thinking of the defensible nature of the country in the case of foreign invasion. A few thousand of armed men on the hills could successfully defend them. Wales would make an excellent republic...""


""The Cambrian"" of May 11, 1839 noted that a large number of colliers in the hills of Tredegar had given notice to discontinue work, and the leaders of the Chartists were to give a demonstration requested many of those who were unemployed to join them. So the idea is not new. But for me, looking for a 'stopping off' point where history separates from what we know and goes off on a Nextian tangent, I found the following extract in my 'Net-gleaned' history of Wales:&lt;
'....November, 1839: ...up to 5,000 rioters ""from the hills"" Ebbw Vale and surrounding districts entered Newport in three columns, one being commanded by John Frost. They marched to the Westgate Hotel where a small detachment of military waited inside. Accounts of what happened next vary, but someone opened fire on the soldiers, who responded with a volley into the crowd. In the ensuing panic, a score of workers were killed and many more wounded; the rest fled back into the hills, having brought this particular rebellion to a violent and speedy end...... On December 7, Newport held a public meeting to thank the soldiers for their brave defence of the town ""thus saving it and the whole of England from rebellion."" ""The Cambrian"" also commented that there was every reason to believe that the Chartists' order of the day was for SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS OF THE CROWD UPON CARDIFF AND PONTYPOOL, BUT THE OUTBREAK AT NEWPORT HAD TAKEN PLACE A DAY TOO EARLY. (my caps) According to the paper,its failure had prevented the general uprising expected to take place throughout south Wales....'



Very interesting. What if the Newport rising had taken place on the right day? The ill-equipped Welsh rioters would have suffered appalling losses yet the Chartists might have won the day in the legislature; such bloodshed might have caused an earlier reform act. After all, the Chartists six main grievances:

Universal male suffrage, 


Vote by ballot,

 
Equal electoral districts,

 
Annual parliaments, 


Abolition of the property qualifications for election to Parliament, 


Payment for parliamentary members (so that it could be open to all classes).


As you can see, all of them apart from annual parliaments were taken up - and several of them during the Chartist's movement's life, to try and take the wind out of their sails. So I guess the following might just happen:


1839: Newport, Pontypool and Cardiff have risings on same day; large fighting, 720 Welsh killed to 47 British. Rather than fight a protracted civil war in Wales and under pressure from Landowners, the British Government decide to look at the Chartist's proposals and agree to many of them.


1840:	Hate of the British still high; each of the twelve Welsh constituencies elected members from the newly formed Welsh Colliers Society, all of whom argue successfully for a nationalisation of Welsh coalfields.


1844	Home rule established and iron and steel production starts to peak; Under the leadership of Frost, there are calls for a Welsh Republic run on strictly socialist terms. Karl Marx invited to join Government and lives in Llandeilo; buried in cemetery there.


1852	Wales declares independence. England, weighed down with troubles in Russia and the Irish Famine, see's no reason to argue with a belligerent and committed Welsh assembly. Trade links are good and the partition is agreed. (more...)



1876	New government in England declares intent to unify Britain by force if necessary.


1878-1882	First Anglo-Welsh battle fought near Chepstow. Attritional, there is little loss of life. An attempted Naval landing at Swansea is thwarted by bad weather; three men-o-wars are wrecked - 720 British sailors drowned.


1890	Anglo-Welsh non aggression treaty. Trade links re-established.


1901	Welsh council suffers split as various factions argue of the future of the republic. Pro loyalists want unification and civil war looms.


1903	Lenin visits Wales assumes command of newly formed Welsh 'Soviet.' Borders closed but trade links maintained.


1908	Wales gains huge market share of world steel - Welsh coal and iron needed to fuel British war machine in the first world war, and railway lines from Port Talbot snake around the globe. England remains distrustful and steps up production of iron and steel in the Midlands.


And why not?''

Yes I know science.

From your Cambiling link:

&gt;""In particular, the linguists have realised that comparatively few studies have focused on those children who move to a different country and begin learning a second language at primary school age.""

So even this comparatively large group hasn't been studied sufficiently. So you reckon enough study has been made of those who haven't moved to a different country but study a second language at primary school age? In short it seems studies have looked mainly at those who are bilingual from birth. As the studies appear to show bilingualism affects brain structure then it's natural to consider that any benefits be severely reduced in those who are not getting bilingual input from birth.

Also I'm hoping that the reports on these studies have not been over-promoted. Your BBC link talks of making a full conclusion on the benefits of all bilingualism based on the study of 23 bilingual people. Science without statistical significance is pretty moot when talking about education and political polices over millions of people.

Your quote from Dr Parodi stands, do you know what research he based his observation on?

Now as we're hypothesising bilingualism is a benefit over other situations do you know what research has been done, for example on whether learning art or maths intensely from a young age gives one a sufficiently developed second ""language"" to provide the benefits that a second natural language does.

There has been a massive media story going on for a while now about how the metropolitan police colluded with News International (ie the 1%), not mentioning the fact that numerous government ministers and the prime minister himself are being very coy and evasive about their involvement in this scandal despite their closeness to some of the major players.

Economic liberals, classicals and Austrians all concur though that government is inefficient and wasteful, due to there being no competition inherent in government there is no incentive to make sure what you're doing is efficient. So in the long term having government perform these roles rather than businesses is bad, because over a given time period (lets say 30 years) having private enterprise lift that area out of depravity is less wasteful. These people would argue that yes, while shrinking government by 30% in the short term won't help those areas, the businesses that *have* to arise at some point or another in the wake of those public services being shut down will be better in the long run.

Both of those are accepted as working, but the question which everyone argues about is whether to run programs for the long term or short term.

Edit: An additional thing I will add is that, especially now, during a credit crisis. Is that government spending *has* to be lowered due to the risk of credit ratings being downgraded, while there is no immediate risk of this happening to the UK right now it's as Plato said better to prepare in peace for times of war.

Also, yes free market ideology does expose us to these troughs in the economic growth cycle, whereas state intervention can lessen the impact of them, but as I made a point before, over time the growth *will* be higher. Edit: I made a little graph to demonstrate [here](http://i.imgur.com/UbOqx.png).

Even on an average salary of 23k/year you'll pay £5,000 in tax and NI. Then probably another £1000 on council tax. You've suddenly gone from being on 23k to being on 17k. That's a pretty severe tax burden for an 'average' person IMO. Being 'average' hardly makes you wealthy. 17k/yr after tax hardly gets you a life of luxury. It's ridiculous that someone earning that much pays so much tax.

Then of course there's the 20% added to almost everything you buy. And fuel duty. And stamp duty if you ever manage to save enough to buy a house. And capital gains on your savings. 

I can totally understand people wanting to minimise their tax burden. It's not just about greed. Morality does play a role too. Why SHOULD someone be forced to pay into a system in an amount which doesn't benefit them? Many people pay way more in than they would ever get back out of the system. 

Of course I don't want to live in a country where people starve in the streets.

Though I think there are cracks in that system too. Lots of low paid workers, like here. But they do genuinely seem to care about developing staff rather than our short term hire and fire attitude.

Judging by our car manufacturing our labour unions are clearly fit for purpose. But our management and banking is not. At least they are more focused on global high finance than native industry. But its kind of understandable as finance offered higher and faster returns than high tech industry. Which is why German banks went looking for risky things to invest in like Greece...

Avoiding the Euro was good. Except that I think it kind of shifts the problem elsewhere. The Euro is there to prevent a 30s style race to the bottom devaluation game. But in a globalised economy where Europe is just a part of it that doesn't work so well. Its not internal trade but global trade causing the distruption.

He was one of the very few people who warned about the abuse of financial derivatives before the crisis hit. And a growing economy would benefit him much more than a less regulated shrinking economy. The basic issue with him is no more than: you don't ask a businessman for advice on macroeconomic policy, because business and economics are two different areas of expertise.

Chile and Argentina have proper levels of poverty that I would like to avoid. Its just the kind of setup I would fear. Medium sized industrial states with a  tiny rich elite and lots of poverty and inequality. And I see this as our more likely future.

South Korea is a new industrialised country that has benefited from the state supporting the commercial sector, controlling imports and pushing for exports. Its done well with that model from that base.

Switzerland, Australia and Japan are more interesting cases. Although Japan is going through a very long recession it seems to be closer the German model with a state that backs its commercial industries.

Switzerland is small country with a small population. Perhaps more like a lighter populated South East of England.

Australia is a mineral rich continent with a small population. Again not directly comparable but more relevant than others.

My questions would be what can we learn from those states? Learning from Japan would be like learning from Germany would it not? I wonder what we can learn from Switzerland?

On the 'left' you have people saying the government needs to spend now to create jobs et cetera so that the economy will grow and demand will return; we can talk about the size of the public sector *later*!

Of course this ignores the fact that the moment the economy is 'saved' and you have a discussion about the size of the public sector the only answer is that removing any of it will result in the economy shrinking and so the answer is a depression or mass debt (which can end up in an even bigger depression).

But on the 'right' they talk about cutting the deficit and debt but don't have any other plan to solve problems than removing the small twig keeping the skyscraper standing.

And it's hardly the case that the world economy, or human technology has reached its peak. There's no reason why we can't be a part of that further development.

Of course we will have to adapt to new circumstances. If we are slowly going to become even more a nation of professionals, of engineers and scientists, our culture will have to change to place more emphasis on education, and more emphasis on excellence across society.

Keane was my favourite player. So I started following Tottenham games. Watching Keane smash shot after shot after shot into the back of the net was something beautiful. IIRC he scored like 15 goals or something that year. I was hooked. Tottenham missed Champions League by 1 spot that year, although I knew pretty much nothing about UEFA at that time, so I wasn't to upset about it. Then Bale came. Being a winger myself, I fell in love. His style, skill and speed were breathtaking. It was awe inspiring. I'll never forget that game against Fulham where he scored his first goal on the flick from Keane. It was my two favourite players combining beautifully. I was so upset at the end when Kamara hit the overhead kick for the late equaliser. Heart-wrenching. Since then, I've supported Spurs through it all. Living in the US, theres few other Spurs fans that are withing my friend circles. But most of my friends follow PL, and we share the love for the beautiful game.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Followed the Premiership casually for a couple of years without any real allegiance, from 2007 to 2009-ish. Watched a game every once in awhile, but I was hardly hooked. Based on the people I knew, and what I'd heard, from reading around, I always had a dislike of United and Arsenal, and that was around the beginning of Liverpool's downfall. Which makes sense, personally, because I've always had a thing against teams that wear red. My high school's rivals wore red, my university's biggest rivals wear red, and the college team I rooted for in high school's rivals wore red as well. Once I grasped the gravity of derbies, I remember a certain derby in North London between a team wearing white and a team wearing red. I remember hearing the drama surrounding the early season firing of a manager and the hiring of a new one, how one team were huge underdogs and certainly didn't have a chance of competing. Then some guy named David took an audacious shot from 30 meters. I was impressed, to say the least. Then, 87th minute, red team is up by 2 goals. White team scores, and all of a sudden I'm absorbed in this match, hoping for what, up to now, would be the greatest finish for a football game I'd watched live. 5 minutes of stoppage time are added after the goal, and it was practically written in the stars now. This stuff has to be scripted, right? Some midget lines up a hopeful shot from 20-something yards and I remember jumping to my feet when it flew past the keeper, and groaning in frustration when it bounced off the post, going halfway back to sitting and seeing a blur of white come running in from the left, ahead of all the red jerseys and tapping it in from mere yards out. It was early in the morning so I controlled my volume but I jumped, yelped, and just put my arms up in silent celebration, for a team from a faraway country, filled with players I didn't recognize whose names I couldn't pronounce, at 7 in the morning. After reading the histories of various clubs, I'd already ruled out Chelsea, and City had just joined the ranks of the rich. The 2009-10 season started and I watched whatever games I could, mostly at random, but over time, I noticed myself watching more and more games involving a team called Tottenham Hotspur, who by that time I recognized as the favorite team of one of my good friends from England and a reference to Shakespeare, which I thought was hilarious the first time I noticed it. 

More and more I watched their games and became more and more invested in their results. It happened quickly, I was lovestruck. I remember my first time clearly hearing the crowd singing for Spurs when I was sure they were playing in another team's stadium. I remember Defoe's 7 minutes of madness against Wigan, and Bentley knocking in a free kick for fun a minute later. And the three goals after that. I remember Lennon nabbing the win in the 95th minute from Birmingham and how I thought I'd never heard a louder crowd on the TV. The excitement of Defoe scoring in the first minute and United and the pain of the rest of the game. Danny Rose. Bale vs Chelsea. My first time whistling the tune to ""When the Spurs Go Marching In"" while doing something completely irrelevant to football. Wondering who the hell Pavlyuchenko was and why he was listed as starting because I haven't seen him at all over 70 minutes and look at that, he just scored. Complete disappointment against Portsmouth. Pure fucking ecstasy at the Eastlands when I fully grasped what that tall, goofy man's header had secured for us after my earlier mental breakdown when King's goal had been disallowed.

Or in other words transparency. Gold is a terrible conveyer of legitimacy, was this stolen? Has it been debased? Are the claims of this centralised authority purporting to 'own' *X* amount of gold believable? It doesn't meet the criteria of working on the micro nor macro level, and immediately incentivises land grabs. Artificial (or accidental) scarcity is probably the biggest cause of war, so I am hesitant to go down that route.

I'm open minded to a short term fix, although depends what you judge to be the short term. I suspect fags and beer will be used before gold, hell even the potato has a shot. (The other thing that was lacking is a lack of interest regarding money creation.)

We seem to have an agreement on the qualities, transparency is key. If we agree on the definition of what money is (ie a representation of an incomplete trade, where money is a formal expression of one party accepting the promise of some future wealth for some immediate and real), then to get to transparency I can not see a way round making public every transaction that occurs in that currency, and tagging money with the initial debtor and creditors identity.

As for the +1; Of the various names being bandied about, I'd like to see Modric. 

I used to really like Yoann Gourcuff as a long-term replacement for Lampard, but he seems to have proven far too fragile both mentally and physically over the past 2-3 years to be considered a realistic option. 

Maybe, and I mean MAYBE, he could be brought in if there proved any truth in the Laurent Blanc rumours.(Blanc seems the only coach who was ever able to get the best out of him). Even so, with the chronic injuries he's had this year it'd probably be a bad investment.

The walk into university was usually pretty busy, especially for 9/10am lectures. If you are on a lecture heavy course you'll definitely get to know people from your walk in with others. Walking back to halls is less easy to organise but it happens.

I didn't find being in stoke bishop a problem for societies, but I was not heavily involved in first year. Their are plenty of social activities in and around the halls area (i.e. Wednesday afternoon sports on the downs are just next door and the main outdoor sports areas are closer to stoke bishop than anywhere else). Stoke Bishop also has tennis, basketball and squash courts on top of all that at its disposal. 

For going out, I think stoke bishop is awesome as it encourages you to group together for getting taxis into centre and out again (cheap in a full group). The collection of super cheap student hall bars makes it an easy on the wallet place to have a good time as well. It gives the 'quintisential' student experience really.

For people who didn't get a chance to listen, here's some points that stuck out - 

.

**Mistakes at Reading**

""I've made mistakes right the way through in my life, and i've always learned. My biggest mistake was at Reading. I probably just tried to change too much too quickly. I believed I had three years, I was totally trying to change the whole football and philosophy at the club, and trying to get the slick passing style that obviously was effective and won games. What I didn't want to do - you know I was aware that a lot of these players would maybe have to go, so I didn't want to start a process and 6 months in have to lose a lot of players...

""...Let me say that was a real defining moment for me. I've been working nearly 20 years in football, and that was really the only sort of low in relation to the work. But I certainly learned from it, and it made me more clinical towards getting to the end point much quicker. When I went to Swansea, thankfully I had that success.""

.

**Transition to his style of play**

""It's certainly not going to be this massive revolution walking in, this is going to be something that has to evolve. As a coach and a manager, the principles of your game are dictated by your players, it's as simple as that. I obviously have a way that I love the game to be played, which is the effective passing game, so I think i'm going to need to make a few changes in terms of playing personell in order to do that. But i've also got to give the players a chance.

""I feel maybe I need to go in and give the players a bit of confidence, try and take a bit of weight off of that shirt. And it'll slowly evolve, because it's not a race at the minute. I think there's a touch of realism of where the club's at in terms of the players and the supporters, it's not quite aligned. The supporters are world class, the team has just dropped off a wee bit and with confidence we can pick up again next season and hopefully push on and show that steady progress, and then over the next few years build and work our way to the top of the division where Liverpool should be.""

.

**Picking Up Less Known Players**

""In terms of the players you're talking about, the lower level players, i'm about giving people a chance and if there's any club that shows what it's about in giving people a chance, I always thought that was Liverpool. If you look back over the years, I think that was a big thing at Liverpool. They brought in hungry players from England, Scotland, Ireland and put them together and made them a proper team and a club. The core principle was hard work, and because those players were hungry since they were coming from a slightly lower level, they were hungry to go in and they worked their socks off and had success. Sometimes football gets complicated now in the modern game where it's so - money can distort the reality, really. People think you spend 20, 30 million on a player and he's guaranteed. I've seen it, that doesn't always work...

""...For me it's about talent, opportunity and hunger. And if they've got that, i'm not a snob to where they've come from.""

.

**Biggest Challenge at Liverpool**

""I think it's just tying to make forward steps. The team finished 8th last season. I would say they were better than that. And that's not any disrespect to anyone. Kenny was an incredible man and still is. He's someone that's really been the heartbeat of that city and the club, and he's a man of class, and how he's nursed that club and that city through some real tragic moments has been phenomenal. But I feel that moving forward is just taking steps forward. Liverpool is a club that should be in that Champions League. But it's not just that. The aim for Liverpool can't just be 4th, it has to be to be number 1. But that's a process, and that's going to take that wee time to do that. I feel we're all eager and obviously we'll work towards that on a daily basis and on a yearly basis.",0,1338663564,null,0,false,0,c4vetg3,t3_uh8lv,t1_c4vetg3,t3_uh8lv,null,1429053341,12,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,12

I pretty much guarantee there are Spurs supporters in London who don't know shit about our youth players, or who can't tell you the difference between a deep-lying playmaker and a #10, or who don't know shit about different tactics or types of players, etc.

I started supporting because I wanted to try FIFA even though I had no interest in soccer. And I looked on Wikipedia to find a team that stood out to me. I naturally picked the one with the funny name, the cock and ball as a logo, and the 6'7 hideous circus man in the squad. 

And now here I am over 3 years later having spent hundreds of hours making compilation videos, poring over stats, and waking up at 6:45 AM to watch games on a shitty stream in another language. I missed two games all season. One because of work and the other because it wasn't televised. I listened to our kids lose in the League Cup on a fucking internet radio stream. 

How is that any worse than being indoctrinated by a parent at a young age? I may have selected the team arbitrarily, but I still fell in love with it. And it's now to the point where I feel confident enough in my knowledge of the team and the game to have intelligent discussions with people who have been at it for all their lives.

Samsung Galaxy S3: £31 per month on vodafone - 300min, unlimited texts and 500mb of data. Obviously not a lot compared to 3, but its a superior phone. 

If you want unlimited data, Go for either T mobile or Talkmobile (Talkmobile is Carphone warehouse's internal network and they piggyback off vodafone)
So:
HTC One S: £24 per month on talkmobile - 400min, 100txts and unlimited data. that's a £100 up front but works out a bit cheaper in the long run.
Sony Xperia S: £36 per month on T-mobile -600min, unlimited texts and 1536mb of data free phone.

The only thing is that we don't know when they will be ready to be solid squad members. Ramires can partner Mikel there also but he excelled much more when he was played on the right, as it allows him to use his pace and stamina. 

KDB could be the ideal replacement for Lampard, his touch, vision and passing skills are already good and can only get better. Since Chelsea now have Mata, Hazard and Marin he would struggle to replace any of them at the #10 position which is he preferred spot on the pitch.

Season tickets are available, and work in either Weekly, Monthly (4-weeks) or Yearly, depending on your situation. Also, it depends how far you want to go. If you're intending to go to certain places, certain modes of transport will be more beneficial, for example the train lines that run pretty much from one side of Essex to the other.

He is no more tactically aware than any good professional. This is not something I would list as a specific attribute of his. His awareness is nowhere near someone like Mata or even Lampard.

The goal against Barcelona was a straight sprint up the field, with an exceptional ball from a player with great vision (Lampard) and then the chip was a pretty crazy decision in the circumstances but he executed it well, and it came off so all is forgiven.

The balance side of things is precisely why Mikel is a better choice. He wins the ball certainly as well as Ramires if not better, and he provides the short, consistent distribution that is needed from that role.

Also, sort of the entire point of this post is to point out that the ""box-to-box"" midfielder isn't what you want if you play a 4-2-3-1. If we were playing a 4-4-2, or even a 4-3-3 with one holding player (4-1-2-3 you get the idea) then a box-to-box player would be incredibly useful. But the modern 4-2-3-1 functions best without one.

I don't really mean to knock Ramires. He can bring a huge amount to a team. He has unbelievable fitness, he is incredibly quick, he finishes well and he defends well.

This is a very common sentiment, but since most of us have grown up in the post-gold standard (aka post Bretton Woods/post 1971) era, we have been conditioned into thinking paper money is the only money, and gold is an anachronism.

Gold has absolutely no function or industrial use, and there is very little chance of that changing. Its utility is determined by its quality of being an an easily recognisable, hard to counterfeit and rare element to which humans have imparted value over the eons.

true,mad_disciple,null,null,"&gt;The balance side of things is precisely why Mikel is a better choice. He wins the ball certainly as well as Ramires if not better, and he provides the short, consistent distribution that is needed from that role.

This is so massively wrong. The first half of the season Mikel was a failure in the team as he was constantly exposed for having little to no athleticism to cover space at all, it meant players were getting round him into dangerous positions. That has not and does not happen to Ramires. The big thing is that people simply do not understand how much ground he covers, it makes him such a unique player in the team, and one that must be a lynchpin as a result.

Why are you so rigid in formation structures? Do people really think it's about formations in modern football? What's Barca's formation? What's Real's? How rigid do they stick to it? There's a shape they play with but they're much more fluid than that (I know I'm using those two as examples to highlight the point most). Having a player like Ramires, who's so versatile and brings so much gives you so much more flexibility. It's what Yaya Toure has brought to Man City this year, yet no one ever saw him as a marauding attacking midfielder before this year. 

Also, I'm sorry but saying it was a 'crazy' decision to be skilful just nullifies your argument. I mean WOW! His goal against Barca was unbelievable talent, touch and vision. 

Simply wake up and see how much he CAN do, you're so focussed on the roles he's been playing you haven't analysed his performances properly and seen all the work he puts in (which is so much more than every other player on the pitch).

When you talk about awareness as well, comparing him to Mata and Lampard, you're being specific about picking a pass in the attacking third of the pitch. He's not playing that position, he'll be deeper and getting the ball and supporting those that do that function.

Well, it does if you consider the means of production to include the land monopoly.  The monarchy and the aristocracy own an extraordinary percentage of the land in the UK (even setting aside the feudal nature of land ownership I laid out in another post) and many have held these estates since 1066 or shortly thereafter.  See for example [here](http://libcom.org/news/article.php/land-ownership-right-roam-uk-10032006).  This naturally has implications for any ""means of production"" in the sense you were maybe thinking - factories, businesses, etc. - sited on these landholdings.  As someone once wisely said - if you have all the money and I have all the land, how much do you think I'll charge you for the first night's rent?

A small point but that should be projected, no? Perhaps even speculated. One rarely wants the gold, but what it could be exchanged for at a future date.

&gt; There's an obvious solution.

Yes, there is an obvious solution to the Palestinian crisis. While we are at it let us ask the Queen to abdicate. Gold does have plenty of functions (crowns for one!) and I suspect there would be more without the inflated pricing. I've seen it used in heat reflectors, electronic devices, it would be marvellous in dentistry but cost is prohibitive. It would also be quite foolish to project an indefinite 'uselessness' even 25 years into the future. However, technological advancement is a side issue and is quite insignificant compared to the others; the majority you have not addressed, and there are more besides, so by no means is it a form of conditioning. For one it doesn't encapsulate trust, and neither can the little man build international or even regional trading relations easily because gold is cumbersome. Large sums of money would prove easy targets, so then you incentivise close relations between the wealthy and the security classes. We'd be at the mercy of banking, or trading scope would be reduced leading to balkanisation perhaps making for unstable geopolitic. Perhaps the most important: there might be real demand and supply, and the real goods to complete an asynchronous exchange at a later date, but should there be no means of exchange (ie currency) then economic activity is inhibited.

Like we both understand, gold is chosen because of the secondary affordances. If anyone could create a pure fiat currency with those characteristics and more besides, that would be ideal. Clay receipts were once a particular good means of keeping track of the debt record. Digital mediums (and I don't mean bitcoin which shows incredible genius, yet stupidity and a lack of imagination at the same time - why on earth are we mining for digital gold!), can provide such a design. For me that would be a protocol governing the creation of personal currencies, which can then be composed to have local, national, then international scope.

Okay formations. Barcelona adjust their tactics to their opponents a lot, more than anyone else, but they typically line up with four at the back, Dani Alves pushed higher on his side than the right back, Busquets deep in the midfield, with Xavi and Iniesta playing as the two midfielders along with him, and Messi as a false 9. Besides that, they plug in players into that structure where they think they need them, sometimes Keita as another holding player, sometimes Fabregas as another attacking midfielder, sometimes Cuenca out wide. So yes Barca mix it up a lot but they are literally the only competitive club in the world that does this.

Real Madrid play a very organized 4-2-3-1, which they stick to pretty much all the time.

Please don't tell me that chipping the ball straight over the goalkeeper was a good decision. It worked, but it was insane! If it hadn't gone in, he would have been absolutely slammed for that decision!

And as far as awareness goes, its more a question of him not contributing much in the passing game. Mikel has the highest pass completion percent of any premiership player in the last 3 years. What he offers is an outlet for the defenders who is basically guaranteed to maintain possession. Lampard has a greater range of passing and can hit that through ball. Mata's final pass is devastating.

The whole point of this post was to suggest that Ramires is an all around player. He is pretty good at a lot of things. He is certainly the most flexible player on the field. But also to suggest that what managers look for (for good reason too) is players that excel at a certain role, and can play a position perfectly.

The role that Ramires is perfectly suited to is right midfield. He played there for Dunga, he played there for Benfica. He was reported as a CM at Benfica, but he was really the right side of a diamond 4-4-2 midfield. For a team that plays that way he is perfect. That position demands you are very fit, and reasonably capable of doing lots of things. But if you are going to play in a system which is based around 4 defenders, 3 central players, 2 wide players and a striker (4-2-3-1, 4-5-1, 4-3-3, etc.) then he doesn't really fit in.",0,1338669723,null,0,false,0,c4vfwaw,t3_ufs27,t1_c4vfwaw,t1_c4vflre,null,1429053843,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,bull0x,gold,meh,"Previous discussion [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/UOB/comments/hrhva/choosing_selfcatered_accommodation/), but not much on the halls you mention. I remember there being another a year or so ago but can't find it just now.

I'm a Senior Resident at CHH, was here as a fresher 10 years ago and recently came back for a PhD. Here's a few responses from my experience.

* Want to be around other freshers, want a social life:
&gt; All the halls are predominantly freshers - probably ~10% returners, very few PGs. Some halls have a 2nd year committee that run events, some set up a committee from freshers. Student houses have a society called [Orbital](http://bristolorbital.com/) - don't have any experience of it but I'd guess that representing people spread about the city is trickier than having them all in one place.

* Stoke Bishop vs Clifton:
&gt; Stoke B +'s: more people in the same area, bigger halls, more halls (good for bar crawls), some cheaper halls. Stoke B -'s: further away (rain goes sideways across the downs in the winter), but yes the bus is included in residence costs. Clifton +'s: 10 min walk to uni, nearer to town. Clifton -'s: smaller, harder to get into. Each hall is its own social centre, but there are more halls close together in Stoke B.

* Catered or self-catered:
&gt; Your points are all good. One that I'd add is that a catered hall means that everyone gets together in the same place once or twice a day, feels nice and communal. Self catered is usually split into flats which makes for good close-knit groups if you get on well.

* Subject-based influences:
&gt; All pretty well mixed. Some halls have more of a tradition of music and theatre performances, but it's generally down to students to organise stuff. If there's something you want to do, there'll be others that are up for it.

* Choosing a hall:
&gt; To be honest, you're going to have a great time wherever you end up. Have a look at the [hall websites](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/accommodation/ug/guide/residences/), and check out the [videos](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/accommodation/watch/), and go for whatever feels good to you.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"I'm certainly not arguing that monarchs are inherently bad as people - the queen could be the best person in the world.  I've never met Elizabeth, I've heard many stories good and bad, but I don't know enough about her or her personal beliefs and attitudes and so I've nothing I can reasonably hold against her.  Add to that that simply being raised as queen does all sorts of things to a person, as we can imagine, so even if she were psychologically messed up by it, I'd still blame the institution before her.  So, that's my position, the institution of the monarchy, certainly as it's currently configured, is not healthy for our society; the person of the queen is not the point.

Conversely, I'm certainly not saying that a nation without a monarchy is inevitably better.  Many monarch-free places have been and continue to be unfree, unequal, misanthropic hellholes.  Just as I believe a nation is better without (much) religion, but I don't believe an atheist nation would inevitably be more moral.  They just have a greater capacity to be so and less reason not to be so.  And that'll probably start another debate, so before we go there - yes Stalin was a bastard, yes (Soviet ) ""communism"" killed a lot of people (though mostly for reasons entirely unrelated to the fact it was ""godless""), no Hitler wasn't an atheist (but no he wasn't a Christian either).",0,1338670518,null,0,false,0,c4vg17g,t3_uh79q,t1_c4vg17g,t1_c4vfv4y,null,1429053913,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,mad_disciple,null,null,"Why did Romeu play at the beginning of the season, why was he successful and Mikel not played? The whole reason was that Mikel was passing sideways and backwards and having players run off and round him regularly. How many of Mikel's passes are even in the opposition half, let alone the attacking third? Once you break it down you see they are rarely in that part of the field. He was a weak link at the beginning of the season, was derided by Chelsea fans for his lack of mobility, he's looked much better the latter part when the mobility hasn't been required and he can occupy less space. When we go to a passing formation we will NEED a mobile player to close space down as teams will counter regularly. Mikel isn't as good at that as Ramires, so Ramires fits better. I don't understand what about that you simply haven't noticed this season! WOW! Such short memories people have!

Barcelona aren't the originators of that structure and have just taken it to a higher level (based on the passing). Look at the England v Belgium game today and tell me what system Belgium were playing, how rigid it was. Modern tactics are including fluidity. Real Madrid are not rigid in their 4231, only against Barca are they so rigid as they play a specific style against them. Other Spanish teams also adopt this style (Athletic Bilbao being one). Yes, there's a basis to structure, but there's a fluidity to movement and passing.

It was a fantastic decision to chip the keeper, it was a show of confidence, skill and ability. I seriously cannot believe your attitude to it, it's almost like some old fashioned approach to life that risk should be avoided at all times. So bizarre!

Lampard has a greater range of passing, he's also nearly 34 years old and not very mobile. Having both Mikel and Lampard as CMs will be extremely weak defensively, we'll concede like we did at the beginning of the season. Even in Di Matteo's run we still conceded a number of goals, we weren't 'tight' defensively, only in the big games where we parked the bus did we look solid in that regard.

Ramires is better centrally than on the right, that's been proven since he joined the club, time and again. I don't even need to justify that, there's so much evidence for it.

One last thing. We haven't bought anyone yet, haven't actually got a manager beyond the end of the month and posts like this seem to assume what's going to happen going forward. It's infuriating to have our BEST player deemed surplus to requirements with such short sighted thoughts.

As for ""cumbersome"", £1 million in notes would require a suitcase to carry around. The same value of gold is the size of a laptop (albeit a very heavy one). 

I am intrigued by your idea of personal currencies, but I am having trouble envisaging how they could be workable.

true,Tippo89,lfcflame,,"My thoughts on your suggestions. I'm thinking here with £30 mill and the need to focus that on a few top class signings, not spread it across several average ones.
1. Carra is obviously on the way out but to be honest I'm not sure this is as big a priority as some of the other positions. He can do a job as cover, and coates has looked solid. Yes if we can get good value but don't just sign someone for the sake of it.
2. Again, I guess we need cover but johnson and agger have shown they can do a job there if enrique gets injured, and so far he's been pretty injury free. Maybe sign a youngster.
3. Yes, the absence of lucas started the rot and if he's been out once he can go out again. 
4. Not in my opinion. Gerrard first, hendo second, adam as backup and for european games, then there's also shelvey kicking about and possibly even aquilani. Definitely don't think we need someone in central positions. What we DO need is players for both the right and left sides of MF, whether that's wingers or more direct AMF's is up to B-Ro's doctrine.
5. As above. 
6. This and a right or left MF should be our core focus. I'm thinking one of them 15-20 mill, the other 10-15 with money raised from selling.

I agree that if aquilani can fit into our plans that would be great, but we seem to have an abundance of central MF's at the moment so it would be difficult to give him a run of games without bumping hendo, adam and shelvey all to the reserves.

I'd also like to see us get Hoilett, as he looks a decent prospect and I think he'd be a free transfer, with his contract expiring this summer.

I think Dempsey could be a great option upfront. He's a proven goal scorer, positionally versatile and, with his contract expiring next year, he should be relatively cheap.

I'd also like to see us enquire about Adam Johnson, even for a loan. He's got plenty of talent and may be surplus at City.

This way everyone would have a vested interest in politics and society all the time, rather than just at election time through the media. No amount of TV adverts or headlines in The Sun could sway a voter if they knew their MP and opponents and were personally part of evaluating their performance on a bi-monthly basis.

Arsenal are relevant in this situation because Jan was one of your targets as well. If you're allowed to gloat about finishing higher in the league, we're allowed to point out the hypocrisy that goes on whenever a team misses out on a target to one of its rivals.

Few months ago Arsenal fans were jizzing themselves over Vertonghen and now that he's likely not joining them a lot of them are saying he's shit and not good enough for them. 

It's just funny how people rationalize two conflicting opinions. All football fans do it, but it's just fun in this case because it's our rivals. On one hand they believe Jan Vertonghen is a good player, on the other hand they believe Spurs are a shit club. 

So rather than just accept that their rivals wanted a particular signing more, the player is now shit or not ambitious or w/e. That's all it was. People look for ways to rationalize these situations. Our fans do it too.
