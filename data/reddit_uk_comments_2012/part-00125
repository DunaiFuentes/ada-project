Suarez struggled in the first half.  But played much better when they moved him into the center.

Borini probably had one of his better match at Liverpool.  He was more comfortable in the center and had some good opportunity.  He gets into good position and have good movement.

Allen did good but was not as good as previous matches.  While he does a decent job at playing defense, the team is still missing Lucas.

Gerrard was not that good in the first half, but played much better in the 2nd half.

Shelvey was terrible in the first half.  He played too selfish and played little better in the 2nd half.  Would have subbed him off.

Kelly played well.  Did the job he needed to do.  Same with Agger.

Like ProtoKun7 said, they aren't interacting in directly opposite order, thus the need for the journals. Since they don't give each other spoilers, since they keep their diaries synced so that they never affect any future meetings with the other, they aren't creating any paradoxes.

I will say that I didn't care for the reapers. Sure, there should be a penalty for creating a a paradox, but gargoyles? That was a little out there. I loved the emotion in that show and how it set the rules up for us, but the reapers were a little silly.

Now to your question about the TARDIS and time traveling in general, that does seem to affect things. The Doctor has said that the reason Amy can remember people who had been eaten by the crack is because she was a time traveler, and had a different outlook on time than others.

So I imagine, The Doctor who has stared into the vortex, and River, a child of the TARDIS and kinda sorta part Timelord herself, would have a little leeway on the rules. But they still have to keep themselves in the dark about what the other has experienced.

All that said, like many other aspects of the show, the rules on paradoxes, fixed points, and whether time can be rewritten seem to change pretty frequently. They set the rules for the story they want to tell far more often than they tell a story with the restrictions set by the rules. 

Also, there are more instances of The Doctor working with himself. The Three Doctors, The Five Doctors, and The Two Doctors are stories from the Third Doctor's, The Fifth Doctor's, and the Sixth Doctor's eras, respectively. I'm personally hoping for a The Four Doctors next year for the 50th anniversary. I know Eccleston has pretty much been written off as a possible cameo, since he had a bad taste in his mouth from his time on Doctor Who, but Smith, Tennant, and McGann are necessary, and McCoy looks practically the same as he did during his last appearance in the Doctor Who movie in '96. Hell, throw in the alternate universe Tennant, and Patrick Troughton's and John Pertwee's sons (who look just like their dads, or at least close enough to pull it off) and have The Seven Doctors! OK, that's enough fanboy musing.

Don't ever let anyone tell you that you're putting too much thought into anything, especially Doctor Who! :) Just keep in mind that there isn't always going to be a satisfying answer, because as a family show they are known to bend the rules, and the canon itself isn't exactly consistent after 50 years and numerous showrunners.",0,1347737057,null,0,false,0,c68m90c,t3_zxnom,t1_c68m90c,t3_zxnom,null,1429906788,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

Also bear in mind *The Sun* were simply reporting allegations made by a Sheffield-based news agency, who were in turn being fed these stories by high-ranking police officers.

I also thought the character of Jex was more multi-dimensional than most of the supporting characters in Doctor Who, the whole 'choosing your own punishment' idea I thought strongly emphasised that not every character is like the bounty hunter from last week's episode and that not all characters necessarily know what they want, which can be quite hard to write. Jex was torn between this need to be punished, his own self-preservation and the thought that what he did for the greater good was right and that really came across to the audience.

They can try and rewrite history as unclear, but people knew at the time that this story was bullshit and said so. Everyone in the country that was unconnected said so. We remembered the Gotcha headline from the Falklands and knew that they would print stories to push the authorities dodgy line on controversial events - and this event was controversial, people were quickly asking how it could have happened when these events were meant to be safe. Not just leftwingers, either, as it was with Gotcha. This affected nearly everyone - anyone who knew someone who went to watch football.

The ferocity directed at the Sun in Liverpool is because it was perceived as a working class newspaper, and Liverpool was very working class. They realised how much they had been used by an establishment that claimed to be on their side - not much different to how the Sun portrays itself these days, the voice of the common man. They were given a very clear and unpleasant view of that being a lie on the morning that edition of the paper came out all across the city. They knew that lie was being seen all around the country.

The Sun held the corrupt officials line for 15 years, refusing to apologise, protecting themselves and the corrupt while grieving families begged them for compassion and to help them clear the memory of what had happened. They did the publicity for those who blocked a proper inquest into what happened.

The problem with what you're saying is that it gives a reasonable level of understanding to an institution that demonstrated that it felt itself above giving that same understanding to people who had just been through a horrorshow. They have lied and lied and lied for their own benefit and the benefit of those whose power they attach themselves to, having been given umpteen chances to come clean and turn over a fresh page.

Lots of disused space has been turned into beds and people are growing root vegetables, fruit trees, and berry bushes. Everyone can help themselves. See if anyplace near you has some catchy 'tourist thing'. For that matter - play tourist for a day!

There are two reasons this isn't terribly well known:

  - So far, they've mostly stuck to blocking very illegal material. Who in their right mind is going to go to the press complaining that they can't access child porn? What newspaper or TV channel would run that as a story?
  - The great majority of Internet Service Providers don't flash up an error page saying ""We're not allowed to show you that"" if you attempt to access something on the block list.

I would contend the only agenda they had was to sell papers. They received explosive allegations of grossly inappropriate behaviour on the part of Liverpool fans, and realised these would create a buzz and sell papers.

We're still talking about that front page 23 years later, for crying out loud, so if you subscribe to the theory that there is no such thing as bad publicity, this was an almighty boon for the paper.

&gt; Once again, the most charitable view of their behaviour is that they did not act in a way that was professionally responsible.

If I were giving them the full benefit of the doubt, I would paint them as the innocent victims of an elaborate conspiracy orchestrated by the police force.

The reason the US backs Israel is basically because of Jewish lobby groups in the US have lots of money and in turn lots of power, it also helps them to have a stronghold in that region from a strategic view. On that topic, one of the main reasons Bin Laden orchestrated the attacks on September 11th was because of the US' support of Israel, not because he 'hated their freedom' like many American politicians would want Americans to believe.

That needs more investigation that just believing their side of the events.

For the reasons I've explained, they were the paper most loudly denounced by those affected, and they then stood by the story bullishly. The other papers did not.

They are not getting the entire blame in place of others. The whole point of the story is that the Sun took on the grieving families , and that their doing so aided corrupt officials. The other papers are not a part of this because they did not fight and defile the memories of grieving families to the advantage of corruption in the highest ranks of the Police.

If you don't understand any more of this, think about it a bit. It's pretty clear, just separate the question about objective truth from the question about why people are reacting in this way.

In hindsight, responsibility for the disaster is shared by a whole bunch of different individuals and organisations, and it remains unclear whether any of these can be held criminally responsible.

At the time, the police sought to propagate a simpler narrative: It was the fans. The fans caused the disaster, then hampered the emergency response.

Yes, the police sought to make a bigger deal of alcohol consumption than was reasonable. This involved the coroner making the exceptional decision to take samples for blood alcohol measurement from all of the deceased.

I'm not sure about your claim that hardly any of the deceased had been drinking. The tests showed 15 of the original 95 deceased had blood alcohol levels above the drink-drive limit of 80mg/100ml of blood.

That's besides the point, however, because we're well past the point where anyone believes alcohol was an important *cause* of the disaster.

We're talking about the behaviour of other fans while the disaster was unfolding. Were there a large number of people present who were drunk? Without a shadow of a doubt.

Do people have a tendency to do stupid, inappropriate things when they're drunk? Again, without a shadow of a doubt.

Anyway, the day after it all happened i couldnt sleep, i couldnt eat, i was an emotional wreck and knew i had to get mind off everything. I decided to turn on the TV and watch whatever sounded good. As per usual at 8am on tuesday mornings nothing sounded good. I went all the way from channel 1 down to the 500s before it clicked- Doctor Who was on. I have tons of friends who are into the show and the fandom but i never took the plunge. So even though it was a random episode in a random season (end of season 2 of all things) I watched it. It was as if all the emotions i were feeling were truly personified in the characters. It has been really lifechanging watching all of the relationships and all of the love/heartbreak. One of the most important things i have learned is patience. Amy waited 12 years for the doctor to return, but Rory waited 2000 years for Amy to come out of the Pandorica. If my now ex and I are meant to be friends or possibly more in the future, I can wait. It will be hard and filled with emotion and possibly 4 therapists (i won't bite them though!) but I can wait.

I was fortunate enough to take traditional O- and A-Levels back in the dark ages (i.e the mid '80s) and from 1990 have worked in education.  I've seen the introduction of the National Curriculum and the gradual erosion of the content in exams.  Most exams now only require a minimal level of understanding, relying more on regurgitation of information that's simple to remember and (more often than not) actually presented in the question to be answered.  Said information only needs to be remembered long enough to take the module exam and will proably not be used again in any other modules unless it is really, really basic knowledge, like counting.

Worse, there is very little emphasis on ""deep"" understanding, i.e. the development of a full and intuitive knowledge of a subject leading to the ability to take basic information and apply principles already learned to it in order to reach an hypothesis.

I don't care that successions of government ministers and academics have spouted their rhetoric over the last two decades or so; my direct and personal experience is that whilst a GCSE Science A* grade of today is still a worthwhile achievement, it is nowhere near as much of an achievement as an A grade in 1985.",0,1347751631,null,0,false,0,c68pd31,t3_zy2lf,t1_c68pd31,t3_zy2lf,null,1429908254,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

*It is aimed especially at those Liverpool fans priced out of Premier League football. Same colours, same songs, same community of Reds.*

*We currently play in the North West Counties League Premier Division.*

Why? Why 2 years and not 1 or 3? How much will this cost? What research was this decision based on? Is this just an unfounded, knee-jerk reaction? How much are the proposed sentences going to cost? Is there a better way to deal with offenders? Is recidivism expected to decrease with these sentences?

He's been in other stuff, including shit like, bad guy in ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"", bad guy in ""28 Days Later"", bad guy in ""GI Joe: Rise of the Cobra""....  yeah, come to think of it, aside from his stint as the Doctor on Doctor Who, I don't think I ever saw him play a good guy.  Anyway, as the series goes, I really liked him as the Doctor.  But from what I read, he simply didn't really ""fit"" with the crew, and ultimately didn't enjoy working on the show.  So after one season, he decided to leave the show.  And then comes the 10th Doctor, played by David Tennant.  At first I wasn't pleased with him, being new to Doctor Who, and really liking Eccleston.  But as time progressed, Tennant ended up winning me over, and became my favorite.

So can we all accept that the Doctor letting Solomon die was not out of character as characters evolve much like real people and the  Doctor wasn't giving any mercy anymore at the time .

 He has regained it now due to Amy.  The same way Rose helped him have mercy before. Initially he didn't. He let Casandra dry out and explode remember when she asked him to help her. He let others die too but Casandra was actually  human as some people seem to think it's morally fine when he era an alien die. 

The whole point of the companion on New Who has been to make the Doctor good,  have mercy and not go power mad.  He says he is 1200 now so must have been on his own a lot in between picking up the Ponds. This explains why he started to go back to his old ways an let Solomon die . He really needs a constant companion to keep him good.  You can see how he is sad every time Amy says to bring them home for a few months.  He knows he needs them.

We know that he wanted to punish himself for what he'd done in the war, but he was scared of death because he didn't think he could carry all the souls he and ruined up a mountain. In the end, he made the ultimate sacrifice because he believed that either he or the Gunslinger would die. Jex couldn't morally bring himself to force the Gunslinger to carry his soul up the mountain when it was really Jex that ruined the Gunslinger's soul. The episode was all about mercy, and ended with Jex giving his life in its pursuit.

I can't say that it was the best episode I've seen, but it was definitely a clever inspection of religion's morality.

The Doctor is currently living his life in reverse to Amy/Rory. Episode 5 has already happened for The Doctor, and Amy/Rory both were killed in the episode somehow. Because of this, The Doctor overcome with grief and possibly guilt for actions he made is traveling backwards in time of Amy/Rory so he can ""run away from their fate"". He's acted like an overly obsessed parent to their children by coddling them every waking second of every day for the last little while, similar to how a mother cries and freaks out over every minor detail of their child's life (first day of school, prom, first date, marriage, children, etc.).

Thus, until he learns to ""let them go"", he's trying to live every moment of his life with them and be around them as much as possible. In ""Asylum Of The Daleks"", Clara proved she is everything good The Doctor sees in Humanity and has made his peace with Amy/Rory's deaths and will locate Clara before her Alaska voyage. Clara being the ""connection"" between Amy/Rory's fate and the second half of the Series. She reminds him of Amy/Rory.

**tl;dr - Amy/Rory have died in episode 5 by The Doctor's indirect actions against The Weeping Angels. The Doctor is going backwards through Amy/Rory's life now to run away from that fateful day and can't learn to let it go.

You meet many throughout the Doctor's travels, of course it doesnt matter if like the Timelords they've been traveling in time forever or if they've been doing it for 20 minutes, it's TIME TRAVEL. The Daleks can travel in time as well, just not as well as the Timelords, and they have the advantage of pure numbers over the timelords. Remember not every Gallifreyan was a Timelord, limiting their army size greatly.

Honestly if you keep watching you'll notice that they answer a lot of your questions, especially since you're watching from the beginning and they try to cover some of the basics from the original series.

Compare the end of this one to the end of Dinosaurs. He's ok with them putting him off after mercy, but after dinosaurs, he's REALLY down about them saying no. Because he knows he's off to see them again after mercy, there's still time left. After Dinosaurs? He's run out.

He kills himself because of two reasons. 1) He's ready to face those he's wronged. 2) He does not want to make the Gunslinger responsible for any more souls than he already is.

Jex was set up as a foil for the Doctor in terms of actions during war. The reason the Doctor went so off the deep end is because Jex made him remember the actions he took during the Time War. Actions that the Doctor is still trying to repent for.

Point is, we see an amazing amount of character development for the Doctor, Jex, and Gunslinger in a short span of time. This episode was not so much about the plot as it was a device to drive the Doctor's overall story towards the Fields of Tanzallor.

Doctor Who? Who is the Doctor? Not what is his name, but rather, what is his character? What is his purpose in the universe? Is he The Oncoming Storm? Is he the healer, medicine man? Is he the warrior, predator? Is he just Space Gandalf or the little green one from Star Wars?

But what really pisses me off is the people wanting something better, get a darker, deeper Doctor, AND THEN COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW IT WAS REALLY FLAT.

You thought this was worse than DOAS? The ""darkness"" in the Doctor in DOAS was WAY flatter and WAY more shallow than this episode.

This episode was neat.
There was barely any cheese. And it had what the last 2 have been lacking, good depth in The Doctor as who he is underneath all this cuddly care-bear stuff... 

THE ONCOMING STORM.
FIRE AND ICE?
HE BRINGS FEAR, TO MUTHER FLIPPING EMOTION-LESS RACES!!!!!!!!

The Doctor's Darker side wasn't just ""apparent"". It was on the verge of one for many. Which isn't how he plays the game. He's more of a ""How about no one"" Kind of alien.  

Ignore the plot of this episode,if you must, and focus on what the Doctor did. He pushed a man to his death. This man may or may not have deserved it, that's not the point. Yes he did this in DOAS too, but with about 90% less emotion. 

He wanted this man dead, and he wasn't smiling about it. This wasn't a trick, or a trap or a joke. This wasn't him pointing some missiles in the right direction. This was HIM. MOVING THE MAN TO HIS DEATH. Holding a gun to his head. This wasn't a big plan or payback for a bunch of murders. This was a ""fuck you for being like me."" For being A war criminal. And forcing those atrocities on your own kind.

 He. Wanted. Him. Dead. You want a dark Doctor? You don't think you've been given it? 

I enjoy digging into episodes. Even if they seem quite shallow. But it's whatever. Peeps have their opinions. This was mine

I guess what I miss the most are the kind of moments Ten had with Donna so often, when they find themselves in a completely bizarre and probably dangerous situation and they are so enthusiastic about being a part of it all.

Some believe that the first four episodes of the season happen -after- episode 5, which as we all know is the last time -we- see Rory and Amy. The idea is that The Doctor can't handle that they are gone and visits them before their fate. This would explain the Doctor's recent lashing out (killing the guy in DoaS, and being so quick to use guns in ATCM); he's angry and upset over whatever happens to Rory and Amy.

Let's not forget an he blew a Cyberman station/fleet out of space just to make a point in ""A Good Man Goes to War.""

Now, on a personal level, the Doctor has killed many beings, both with guns and even his bare hands. This YouTube compilation shows some of the occasions this has occurred:

At this point, the Doctor HAS to go through the door, because if he doesn't, he won't have the knowledge that he needs to go back and warn himself about it.  This is an example of him interferring in his own timeline.  If he uses time travel to do something to divert himself from tragedy in his own history, then the tragedy that made him divert himself would not have happened.

BUT, if the same situation happens, and the Doctor that appears says, ""No matter what, you have to go through that door!"" then his timeline stays intact.  The events that made him go through the door lead to him going back to make sure he goes through the door.

Now, the Doctor and River are not necessarily meeting each other in reverse order, just out of order.  So, if they have episodes 1 2 3 4 5 from the Doctor's perspective, they might be 5 2 3 4 1 from River's perspective.

To me this is the best way to leave her. She is more or less unstoppable. By herself she was able to render an entire Dalek fleet utterly useless. In that moment she showed us exactly why The Doctor wants, and needs a human companion. But Doctor Donna didn't need either. She was both. An unending force of knowledge and imagination, capable of almost anything. However, being human, and being part Time Lord born into war, she would have been prone to some highly unexpected things. Darkness. Rage. Hate. (Suffering.) To me it's better that she falls off the map. Forgets it all. Sees it all as a dream. If she were to realize the truth of what she was. What she could be. Not only would she have the potential to fix her issues with ""impending death"" because of her insane knowledge, but she could turn... well, evil. Look what happened to The Time Lord Victorious. Hell, look what's happened to The Master. Imagine that power, with the emotions of a Dangerously Savage Child-Race. It's much better that she never has to worry about what could-be. It's better that she forget, and go on with her every day of chips and gossip, than face the horror of what she could be. 

Even still: ""...there are worlds out there, safe in the sky because of her. That there are people living in the light, and singing songs of Donna Noble. A thousand, million light years away. They will never forget her — while she can never remember. … But for one moment... one shining moment... she was the most important woman in the whole wide universe.""

There have been exceptions, but in general it's been a pretty strong policy of his to give everyone a chance, including his enemies.  In the finale of season 4 he even got mad at the Metacrisis Doctor for killing a Dalek, who have normally been the exception to that.

We tend to have a silly, simple and very thin plot, some okay-but-not-really-real characters and a bunch of classy special effects thrown over it to mask out all of the plot holes and lack of character development. While i wouldn't say that that is implicitly what's happening to this season to Doctor Who, it is showing some early warning signs: 

* Quicky, one shot-characters that barely develop in the course of an episode, if at all. 
* Interesting one-line story titles, that pan out in a completely arbitrary direction from the intent of the letters. 
* Heavier focus on how the bad-guys look, than how they act and speak. 
* Blatant, in the face descriptors of what's going on in front of your face already.

Just that those are some readily available examples that you could easily point out in both these past three episodes, as well as the mid-60's/70's of American television, which is when most people will agree that the majority of our cinema started to falter. 
I would like to say that this, and the majority of everything else i have been reading about this season has been an entirely unnecessary dissection of the first three episodes of a full series that has yet to come. Doctor Who has never been about just the individual episodes. It's been about the arcs. The long haul and the full duration and development of the characters and the story.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Okay. This is a lot so please feel free to read what you want. I'm giving you my honest opinion, and I hope I don't come across as snooty. I will say that I'm having a hard time really visualizing your work because your watermark is just so completely overbearing and the image size is so small. I'll do my best for you!

The number one thing that strikes me is that your imagery and your text are very unbalanced. Given the watermark is very strong, if you pay attention to each individual square, the quotation takes up at least 50%, which is an enormous amount especially since you're using either a black or bold style typeface. This makes the overall pieced Doctor's face hard to see, especially when the text covers Matt Smith's lips or part of Tennant's eyes. It's very distracting. Kind of like using a black bar to disguise someone's identity. I like the shape of the typeface you chose, but I would scale back the size of it. The Doctor collage looks like you put a lot of work into it. It's a shame to hide that!

The use of the Danish monetary symbol is distracting, as well. There's really no reason for such a stylized ""o"" anyways, so I would just nix it.

As far as the set up of your quotations, having the diagonal set up is distracting as well. I think if you scale down the size, you would do just find with a horizontal line at the top or bottom of each square. You've got a really tricky layout with this as a whole so you might even want to consider removing the quotations from the squares and putting them at the bottom of your layout maybe like [this](http://www.saveconeyisland.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/landmark-map-w-legend.jpg). If nothing else, it's worth just tinkering around. 

As far as your body paragraph goes, it's hard for me to see whether or not your sans-serif and serif fonts are a good pairing since it's so small, but one thing I did notice was that your leading appears to be a bit tight. If you can loosen it up, I think it will be easier to read, especially at a smaller size.

 I don't think your ""&lt;&lt;Doctor Who&gt;&gt;"" needs the Greater Than/Less Than punctuation marks. The size and font difference is enough pizazz. Also, make sure you use [Typographer's Quotes](http://vancouvereditor.com/resources/blogpics/typographersquotes.png) as opposed to [Dumb Quotes](http://digital.coolspringspress.com/rp_columns_images/images/797.jpg). Dumb quotes are used as symbolic abbreviations of measurement units like feet and inches. 

I would keep your body text below your ""Doctor Who"" title, as well. It won't look as unbalanced that way. I think you can probably get rid of the ""DW"" logo behind ""The Doctor is in"", too. It'd have more punch without the distraction behind it. I do like that you used that logo as a mask for an image of a galaxy, but I don't really know if you need it. Probably something to play around with. You could even just keep the Logo in that square, get rid of the ""Doctor Who"" title, and instead replace the title with ""The Doctor is In"" going across your two columns.

I know that's a lot, and, like I said, I hope that I didn't come across as snooty. I really like what you have going on, and I see a lot of ""Oh my god, someone's reposting this work for the fortieth time this month"" potential. You've got a great idea for sure. I love the Doctor face grid especially. I hope this doesn't deter you from posting more of your Doctor Who work in the future! Keep going!

I am just trying to better understand because by the last part of your post it seems like you mean that it was a fixed point in time, and although it was the doctor went one step further and locked the other timelords in time because some had gone mad with their power over time thus the whole thing about the timelord leader refusing to die.

3. Start with 11th Doctor for current stories, S5E1 'The Eleventh Hour' since I feel like that since this is when Moffat took leader writer it's like a mini reboot from the RTD era.

4. The very beginning, 1st Doctor 'An Unearthly Child'. To get the very full Doctor Who experience, but be warned, a lot of episodes are missing and the special effects are...lacking.

5. The 3rd Doctor 'Spearhead from Space'. First time in technicolour and no missing episodes (as far as I'm aware).

Something to stop him. Something to keep him from killing every baddie on the spot and calling it a day. Amy stepped up in that part. I loved his ""MY MERCY"" speech he gave to her. But her telling him to literally(and figuratively) put down the gun, step back, and reel it all in is a big sign that he is at a breaking point-

or He's already broken.

I love peoples theories about him already being over the edge because of future events and that these are ""present"" him but ""past"" amy/rory events. 

And what we see is the necessary combination of Doctor and Companion. Without it, he cannot possibly hold back the dangerous overflow that we see in this episode.

And what we gain is an understanding that the without the distraction of a companion to save or a metal dog to call in for backup, the Doctor can become a very, or much more, dangerous person than we have seen. Someone who doesn't just put a little deep twist to their voice and scream at someone. 

A Doctor willing to, not ONLY kill, but to kill without looking back. Something like the Master. But worse?

you can't bring the master back so quickly, and even if you do he is not the same person he has always been. the drumming that had made him crazy/evil has been explained and resolved. he changed, on screen, in ""the end of time"" and became good.

the master is no longer the master. if he comes back, and the only way he comes back, is by unlocking the time war and if/when that happens he will probably be president of the timelords. he's not hiding on a rock somewhere.

additionally, if he does come back at all it won't be happening before the 50th anniversary of the show. Moffat isn't one for cheap ploys. Even he knows that bringing back the master would work better in a huge episode like the 50th anniversary than anything. plus he'd get to write a scene where the master looks at the doctors (since it will undoubtably be a multi-doctor episode) and say ""great... now theres 4 of you"" in some snidely sarcastic sort of way.",0,1347778807,null,0,false,0,c68upmo,t3_zynxx,t1_c68upmo,t1_c68umfh,null,1429910842,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

The cracks in the wall bit was neat right up until ""resetting the universe"" became the answer, and then wishing on a wedding cake blunted any and all repercussions from that. Series six was a study in destroying a strong female character through lazy plot and character development, topped off with a weird pseudo-marriage that's supposed to be the happy ending. And this series promised ""huge cinematic episodes,"" but what it's presenting is a disjointed, weird and out-of-character mash-up where the Doctor casually grabs guns and points them at people and Amy and Rory's marriage slowly crumbles around an issue that takes a conversation and some snuggling to get over. 

Not to mention the show has been strangely disconnected from the Whoverse at large, with almost nothing keeping us tied to the four series that came before Moffat's run, let alone the 45 years that came before that.

1) check whether you are connecting via cable or telephone wire - determines which type of modem \ router you need .

2) buy \ ie. own your router - check that this is ok. with the provider - it is with most . It means you have something to walk away with - ie. you don't have to hand it back when you move . And it give you more control .

3) 4 to 8Mbs on telephone wires is a reasonable speed and should be readily available . Cable is considerably higher speed .

4) if going for cable - you may opt not to have a land line telephone .

5) check the bandwidth plan - how much you can download per month .

6) be aware that routers often have what's called a memory fragmentation problem - basically , if used a lot , they need to be reset ( powered off and on ) every so often . This is a basic software design issue , easily solved , but often not addressed .

7) put a password on your WiFi .

Where and when I went to secondary school (between 00 and 06ish) we used simple hand tools in lower school to make things like spice racks and such. I must have used a large drill bit at some point is my still functioning spice rack has large holes in the dimensions of spice bottles. It was a while ago.

At gcse. I built a remote controlled hover craft and used powered fret saw. Hot wire cutter. Vacuum former. Cnc 2d mill for pcbs. Dip tank for pcbs etc etc. Variety of woodwork hand tools. Hot glue. Soldering irons. All the sort of none lethal things they would trust school kids with. 

I didn't do dt at a level but those.guys did more Metalworking so.learnt to braze and such.

This is mainly because the dt Dept was run by three awesome guys who took zero shit and made sure everything was safe and all the tools were used properly. I think all of them were ex forces and didn't react well to being dicked about. Oh and by this time I was at an all boys grammar and gcse DT was compulsory. We were not about hand clamping people to work benches by their blazers though!

At Uni I did engineering so got to play with a whole gamut of shiney thinks. Like laser cutters and 3d printers. Fun fun fun.


In short I loved dt and it inspired me to study engineering. How fucking wrong I was! DT loving school age redditors out there, unless your also really really REALLY love maths DO NOT apply for an.engineering degree.

Thing is, with #2, all of its ""muchness"" was what I liked. It made it almost too much, which was just enough for me.

I don't feel depth, or rather, everything feels interchangeable, non-descript, non-specific. Before these episodes you had to wait for huge revelations but you got bitty bits of continuity to edge you along. I know they're trying for something different now but that was one of the big things that formed the character of the show for me.

I'm frankly a bit spoiled by the crazy, campy, occasionally inventive things this show has pumped out and so far this seasons, it's felt like fanfic or retread or just, well, shallow. 

Except I mostly dug Asylum. Maybe I just like Moffat. It's not like I don't find things to enjoy, but usually I watch an ep of Doctor Who and I have the thought, ""THIS is why I watch this show!"" because it brought me something nothing else had up until that point.

I've ""seen all this before."" Well, no, not dinosaurs on a spaceship, I mean how they handled it.

You get some cool elements but you don't get to ""live in"" the cool elements so much as watch them flitter past so there's nothing to sink into, and I mostly don't care what happens or to whom.

Still I keep being excited and not answering the phone for an hour each week =)

We'd string a few passes together but then lose the ball WAY too easily with a crappy one.

The defending was horrible for at least 2 of the goals too. Buttner should have never got that far, and even if he did, he should have never have got it past Al-habsi.

SWP is actually really good at this - he's quick and has excellent reflexes, so while he can't tackle he can stick a little leg out and aid in dispossessing the opponent.

&gt; When he kills your people, you can start talking about your brand of justice.

**Sovereignty**! The Doctor as Consummate Meddler, always _interfering_ with the functioning of other races. This, I think, is why he takes onto himself (as his weight, if you will) the deaths from his actions as the Deaths He Caused - because there was always the option of _leaving it alone_. The Venetian Vampires come to mind, and possibly the Silence... not to mention the whole thing about the Daleks becoming *worse* because of his enemyship.

---

&gt; Today I honour the victims first! ... all those who died because of my _mercy_!

Violence and nonviolence, **pragmatism** and **idealism**. The Doctor is the idealist hero - the ""triumph of intellect and romance over brute force and cynicism"" - but it is not as if he does not know how to be cynical, how to wield the vast power he *does* have as a weapon. Indeed, it is only because he *does*, all too well, all too intimately, know what it means and feels like to do the pragmatic thing, that we trust him when he *is* and seeks to be idealist.

Which is why it is so so so fascinating to me, his constant, constant, tug towards being the version of himself he hates most of all, and how its his companions, always his companions, people who've lived a fraction of his life and who in no way have any business telling him what is moral... it's always they who bring him back. ""Thank goodness their fate was not in your hands!"" pushes him over the edge, and ""We have to be better than him."" brings him back.

---

&gt; You don't get to choose when your penance is done!

**Atonement**. What does it mean to repent? What does it mean to be a changed man? What does it mean to give second chances? The Doctor constantly struggles with this question, both in himself and in others. Showing **mercy** is betting, *hoping* the other has repented, but you indeed can't trust them to choose when their penance is over...

But then who can you trust? The Doctor? Why does he get to **interfere**? And is it fair to him to ask him to always take on the burden of judging?

The Doctor wishes he didn't feel like he had to. He _wishes_ he could just leave the universe be, let its various unsavoury characters atone, or not; suffer their local forms of justice, or not. But he can't, because he's atoning for something _himself_.

And that's the really interesting bit. The Doctor is atoning, this much is clear. Every life he saves, every child who smiles, every moment of joy he can bring to his friends and to the universe... all of it eases his weight, a bit. Just a little bit. 

But he can never allow himself to feel the weight gone, because, indeed, he doesn't trust himself to choose when his penance is done. 

Who can finally judge the Doctor? Finally free him?

And would it be a good thing if someone did?

---

&gt; And you? Are you a father?

&gt; Why... yes. I suppose I am.

**Family**. Well, more motherhood/fatherhood in this episode, but it's been the theme of family since season six, at least. This hasn't been handled quite so well, but I suspect this is the theme Moffat really wants his run of Doctor Who to be remembered for. 

To be in a family, and to be a parent especially, means to have kindness and ferocity in equal measure, whenever anyone threatens your kin. It softens and it hardens, and it's basically positive.

Unless you're the Doctor. For, you see, when the Doctor gets himself a family, and they are threatened... he goes to War. He disrupts so much of the universe that they think his name means ""Warrior"", and that he has to fake his own death to escape it. And he even pretends he's dead to his family, because he's running from them as well. But then they find out and everything goes back to normal shenanigans, right...?

Today, we saw the man able to accept his death, his terrifying, terrifying death, for his child. And we saw the child, given new purpose, new strength through the sadness, from the death of his familial ties.

_Well_.

This series, though, man Matt Smith looks like he's on the tipping point.  With his Dalek killing spree and his shoving of the other doctor out of the city, I think we're getting a much more interesting character.

My favorite scene was the showdown between the Doctor and that kid.  How deathly serious the Doctor was during the whole thing.  The only way I can describe him is *grim*.  But then when he walks through Amy and Rory he's all smiles again.  That duality makes for a much more interesting character for me.  I've never thought of Matt Smith's Doctor as someone who could simply fuck me up if he saw that it must be done, but that moment hit me really hard.  I'm rambling now.

When I said that she was still an awful person I was asked how I could say something so terrible about somebody with cancer. A terminal disease, sad as it is, doesn't automatically make someone a martyr in my opinion, especially if the only contribution they've made before their suffering was ignorance, racism and attention whoring.

To me, Jade Goody was the embodiment of what is wrong with Britain: she was stupid and proud of it, an abject racist, a shallow, talentless, superficial, ignorant attention whore. Perfect for the three second attention span, mediocrity-worshipping lowest common denominator, but that doesn't forgive her for being an awful person. Having seen what her mother is like, though, I'm not surprised at all that she was like that.

I'm glad that I'm not the only one who feels this way. However, people can complain all they like about the Sun but they do it to sell copies, and clearly people are still eating this shit up.

&gt;The lagoons themselves [of pig waste] are so viscous and venomous that if someone falls in it is foolish to try to save him. A few years ago, a truck driver in Oklahoma was transferring pig shit to a lagoon when he and his truck went over the side. It took almost three weeks to recover his body. In 1992, when a worker making repairs to a lagoon in Minnesota began to choke to death on the fumes, another worker dived in after him, and they died the same death. In another instance, a worker who was repairing a lagoon in Michigan was overcome by the fumes and fell in. His fifteen-year-old nephew dived in to save him but was overcome, the worker's cousin went in to save the teenager but was overcome, the worker's older brother dived in to save them but was overcome, and then the worker's father dived in. They all died in pig shit.

Harder exams is one thing, artificially putting a cap on the amount of people who can achieve the top grade is quite another thing entirely.

true,Prairie_Dog,cyberman,Cyberperson,"I've always imagined that the defenses for the asylum were selective. The shields had to allow the drop off of additional Daleks. We saw that the Doctor and companions were sent by transmat through it to and from the surface without incident. When considering this we might assume that the defenses would allow the transmat of an unarmed or lightly armed organic entity through, after all Daleks would fit this definition. If the being was not a Dalek, the nano-genes in the atmosphere would soon neutralize any potential threat they might pose.

Now the Alaska is a bit different, but let's consider this. The ship itself didn't land, it was escape pods from the ship. We could assume that such pods or their occupants would be unarmed or lightly armed. So possibly the shields were designed to allow the landing of Daleks in small pods, or to allow the landing of shuttles or small ships to drop them off.

So, what do the the shields protect against? Well, clearly weapons of mass destruction that could threaten the asylum as a whole. Possibly any type of large or heavily armed vessel that could do the same. These shields were Dalek technology, and therefore would recognize and block anything the Daleks considered a weapon that could threaten the asylum. Exactly what the Dalek Parliament needed to use to destroy it. Therefore, they have a problem that only an agent on the surface can solve.  It's easy enough to get a few beings down there, because the shields aren't designed to defend against them. The nano-genes and a planet full of insane Daleks are all that is needed to defend it against that type of threat.",0,1347801005,null,0,false,0,c68wu65,t3_zyn0h,t1_c68wu65,t3_zyn0h,null,1429911845,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Bad news for you, the Doctor isn't ""becoming Angry"".  

The Doctor IS Angry.  He is always Angry.  He is Anger and Rage and Hate and Kindness and Sadness and Laughter and Mercy and Death. 



We get to see the Show he puts on for his Companions, but inside, he is a tormented, angry man who hates himself - for what he has done through all 11 of his lives, and what he must CONTINUE to do.  


The Doctor is Dark and Angry - what we see normally - especially in the 11th Doctor - is the mask he wears so he doesn't frighten those he cares about with that Darkness.  Even when it looks like he's goofing along and being stupid and we think he has not a clue of what's happening or going on...he already has it figured out and planned.  Because that is who and what he is - you do not live 1200 years and 11 lives without learning how to be a consumate fool to hide how truly truly dangerous you are to the Universe at large, and to those you love.",0,1347803642,null,0,1347815966,0,c68x5wy,t3_zxrh2,t1_c68x5wy,t1_c68tfkv,null,1429911999,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

I also find the general level of objection to the pushback in exam grading to be over the top. Grades have gone up each year, every year for twenty years, while our international relative performance has declined. It doesn't take a genius to see the political expediency in it. And it is not only economically destructive to acquiesce in this, but morally wrong. Take a student who is brilliant at Maths, but poor elsewhere, and a student who is good all round.

You should look into the history of the media and what it managed to do, and how closely aligned the military is with telecoms, publishing (all media) and advertising. Remember Saddam the baby killer and the fake incubator story? What about Saddam and WMDs? What about Osama living in [super-villainous caves](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGhGHxw0mSo)? How about getting the public to [fawn* over it's oppressors](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/index.html)? (Currently that is Kate and her sickly smile.)

They are, unfortunately, relatively mundane things to do while drunk. Unconscious people are robbed and emergency services attacked by drunk people every week on the streets of Britain.

Part of the problem here is that many people didn't understand the gravity of the situation while it was unfolding; even emergency responders reported thinking the dead bodies laid on the pitch were simply unconscious people.

The actions were made grossly inappropriate by the context, and even at the time the context wasn't clear.

They should be the right of everyone who has the ability and desire to do them, regardless of how many people that is.

There is some truth in what you say though, but I think its the attitude that a degree is an automatic passport to 'good' jobs that is more damaging, and the main reason people go into degrees who shouldn't.

I also don't understand why we still divide so rigidly between academic and practical studies. There is in principle no reason why someone learning a trade could not also study a science, art of humanities subject if they so chose. 

There is also no reason whatsoever to attach a higher status to the former than the later, but we do and this is the other main reason people do degrees who shouldn't.

&gt;edit: and yet again they ignore the fact that while fees are more the amount a university gets for each student is lower now than it was last year, so its our university system which is going to come out of this worst off.

With Drogba gone, and an entire pre-season where he knows he's the only big-time striker we have, there is no excuse for low confidence.

Britain needs to be able to compete with providing top notch education. Us kids from Britain come nowhere near the top of the league tables internationally. The Chinese and Indians have much stronger exam systems which introduce more competitiveness and therefore harder working students. I don't say that we should copy them, but we should take into account that GCSEs are not good enough on the international stage.

true,UnoriginalGuy,welsh,Wales,"This was covered in the last thread about this, so let me summarise:   

 - Tax dodging is immoral.    
 - Tax dodging is unfortunately legal.    
 - Littlewoods paid too much VAT over several years.   
 - The government only wants to repay the simple interest instead of compound interest on the overpaid VAT. Littlewoods thinks this is ""unfair"" so is suing.   
 - Littlewoods (the company) and the ""Barclay Brothers"" aren't the same entity either legally or otherwise.    
 - It makes no logical sense to start a witch hunt against Littlewoods because of completely legal but immoral behaviour conducted by some of its board members.   
 - A moral case can be made for why the government should have to pay the compound interest instead of the simple interest on the overpayment.    

I think the ""tagline"" of this infograph:   

 - ""If you're also tired of the filthy rich dodging their tax now is the time to act.""    

Is highly disingenuous. There have been tons of great times to act on tax dodging, and tons of scandals conducted by both businesses and individuals (even in the Commons).    

This is not one of them. This lawsuit has nothing to do with either tax dodging or tax dodgers. To turn it into a ""thing"" is a foolish misstep by the anti-dodging people. They've chosen a poor battle in a much bigger ""war.""

For various reasons, purchasing things with credit cards isn't always the best method to use. And so, quite rightly, not everyone has one.

Some people really don't have enough money in their account to use their debit card. (You assert that there might be criminals in the queue, but don't at all suspect that there might be people who are less well off financially?)

Some people, particularly beyond a certain age, don't always seem to have a complete understanding of what a debit card does (and so prefer to use cash).

Quite often people going to a small local shop will just grab some cash or change to spend, or won't have their wallet on them. Some people might question your use of a credit card to spend 58 pence.

Some people have patience, don't feel the need to rush around, or just aren't bothered about waiting.

true,gwink3,donna,Donna,"11 is starting to realize the monster he has become since the time war. A monster that has killed countless aliens. 9 tried to attone for his sins and over time slipped into being more cocky. He became Time Lord Victorious by the end of 10. As 11 has aged we have seen how destructive he can be (eg Demon's Run). The difference between 11 in the prior series and the current series is that 11 has realized  how many people he has hurt. The first three episodes have antagonists that are designed to foil the Doctor and they pour salt into his emotional wounds. It is truly amazing what the writers and characters are doing to torment the Doctor.

Something I saw in another post, which I think could very well be true, is that in the Doctor's time stream Amy and Rory have already met their final demise. Right now he is going back into their time stream to try and make their last few adventures fun before the younger Doctors screws it up for them. 11 knows something they do not and seems tormented by it. 

So far for the first 3 episodes of the season I enjoy it much more than the other seasons of 11. Before now he was a reckless ""youth"" going around and destroying everything without care for repercussions. Finally he realized the pain and suffering he causes.

Jo O'Meara was the S Club 7 girl, right? She probably figured that she at least had her pop career as backup to save enough face to keep royalty cheques coming in.

The whole ""Shilpa Poppadom"" incident for me wasn't awful because it was racist, it was awful because it was just shallow and ignorant. Racism is pretty dependent on those two qualities anyway, but the I don't think Jade Goody was actually racist, she was just stupid. ""Shilpa Poppadom"" was simply the wittiest way she was able to express her distaste at somebody who different from her. Without any actual knowledge of anything beyond her tiny little sphere of experience, she just went with a stereotype attached to her victim's skin colour. She didn't have enough intelligence for there to be any real race-inspired hate behind it.

Nobody deserves cancer, but reading comments like ""heaven has gained an angel"" after Jade Goody's eventual demise was a lot to bear, given that the only thing she had ever given the world was the hope that stupid people could achieve notable fame just on the basis of being stupid. I despise Big Brother and other reality TV shows for giving the spotlight to people like this and encouraging others to try for their 15 minutes of fame by leaving their dignity at the door and generally acting like total wazzocks.

- When he first enters the tardis he isn't moved at all (gives a pass away comment about, he read physics theory's on stuff)

- When he fights the vampire in Venis, despite been clumsy was able to hold him off (similar to how the doctor was clumsy but also skilled when using the fob watch)

- In the God complex (hotel with all the rooms, with you fear inside) Rory doesn't have a room (The Doctor says people have rooms cause they have faith in something, so Rory doesn't have faith in anything? though he would have faith in Amy at least)

- Also in that episode there is a reference to the master, when the Doctor opens his door he says ""of course it's you"" and you hear the tardis making the same emergency noise it did with the master

- River is a timelord. Though it is explained she is a timelord because she was conceived while the tardis was traveling though time, it also says it took the timelords thousands of years of been exposed to become timelords. (would make more sense if Rory was already a timelord, and a bigger *_* with river been his daughter etc)

- When River regenerates in front of them and Rory is exposed to the energy, he says something like ""is anybody elses head banging?"" (which would be the 4 beats the Master hears) - Amy gives a pass away comment about it been Hitler in the cupboard (even though, we can't hear anything)

And though that is true; it is slightly reductionist. As the data is skewed by the amount of qualifications which are not taken across the board. These figures include A* grades from the GCSE in hospitality; a subject which could politely be inferred that less able students tend to take. 

If you look at the source wikipedia brings its data from: http://www.bstubbs.co.uk/gcse.htm

This shows that the most common subjects have much more inflated A* grades - these tend to be the most important. With about 20% in biology, chemistry and physics GCSEs gaining A*s. 

We shouldn't be looking at the GCSEs which people rarely take, rather the ones which everyone takes. As that would give a better measure of how the whole population is being examined.

This data does show the level of grade inflation over the years as well, this is a concern - are grades being inflated because students are smarter? Or being taught to the test more? Is there an underlying political agenda, where governments are unhappy to reform education because our students seem to be getting smarter each year on paper?

While the better solution would be to just build more houses that will take time and money, and in some places isn't possible/easy due to planning restrictions or local opposition (oddly, from social tenants in some rural communities). So unfortunately steps need to be taken to ensure that once a social housing tenant's kids have grown up and left home, that they downsize into something smaller thus freeing up the bigger homes for families who need the space more urgently (kids visiting for Christmas, needing an occasional place to crash isn't an urgent need imo).

I think the education should be evolving, rather than regressing. I am not saying I am entirely happy with Michael Goves plan; though I do believe it is a step in the right direction.

I think we should be taking the good points from both the GCSE and the old O level system to create a stable and rigorous examination system which caters for the whole population but also the high fliers.

I mean nowadays the kids are choosing their GCSE subjects in year 8. They at least 3 years to take the GCSEs. Maybe even four, as some schools start teaching to material early to try and get a head start. Three years to teach GCSE.

It isn't good enough, though I agree - reverting entirely back to the old O level system would be wrong. Though people seem give me the idea that there is only two choices - o level or GCSE, as if there are no compromises and they are mutually exclusive - we can still include modules, but with less chances for retakes, and including a standard amount of time to teach for the qualification and using measures to prevent grade inflation.

true,youmustlikeit,smith,Smith,"My theory is a bit different from most I've heard.  I do not include anything outside of the TV show in this.

First off, I believe he has absolutely no idea now.  When he does mention it, it's just BS.  Something he made up on the spot to sound impressive.  The only way for him to know his age would be to have had a clock running in the Tardis since he originally stole it, which I doubt.

Second, I don't think he has actually aged much since 1963 at 76 Totters lane.  That was his first incarnation, and he was already very old.  At least several hundred years, regardless of what age he may have given.  He had just recently stolen the Tardis and been exiled before that first episode.  So his life prior to taking the Hand of Omega and the Tardis was probably a fairly normal life on Gallifrey for half a millenia or so.  Also, this first incarnation establishes the fact that as the years go by, he physically ages so that by 400-500 years old, he looks like a 70 year old human.  We don't see his other incarnations physically grow old like this.

Since stealing the Tardis, his adventures and flirting with danger have caused him to regenerate 10 times now, at a much greater frequency than Timelords of old back on Gallifrey.  Also, for much of the show, both classic and new, he is having adventures with companions in a fairly linear fasion, with continual overlap of companions who don't age much.  There are only a few gaps, such as from 7 to 8 and 8 to 9, and some bits of 10 and 11.  But the entire classic series was basically linear.  These adventures as a whole do not encompass a lot of time, and there isn't much room to insert more time.

So I theorize that he has only lived 50 to 100 years since stealing the Tardis.",0,1347823270,null,0,false,0,c691aps,t3_zyshl,t1_c691aps,t3_zyshl,null,1429914015,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

I live just outside Dudley. The EDL have ""visited"" Dudley a few times over the last few years, to protest. Mostly to do with the local Mosque.

Long story short, the Mosque in Dudley was built when the local Muslim population was pretty small. It served the needs of the community pretty well. Flashfoward to now, and the building isn't fit for purpose - bot in terms of the standard of the building, and the fact it's too small for the increased Muslim community.

The EDL have used this as a platform to promote hatred and distrust of the local Muslim community. And unfortunately, they've been pretty popular doing so.

The point however? The EDL claim that they're ""defending the rights of the people of Dudley"".

Does one leave these people to the free market and a return to slums and unregulated private housing or does the society build and hold housing stock of sufficient quality that it is fit for habitation and is paid for eventually by the rents of the tenants?

You see, it is simple really. YOU are subsidising no one. You are paying taxes, part do which helps support many of those in society who through circumstance or for other reasons cannot support themselves to the same level you can.

At some point in your life, you may need the help and support of the state. Please pray that those who make the decisions about the help that is afforded to you do not feel, as you seem to, that no-one should contribute to the general well-being of society.

In case you may have preconceptions that I am one of the people who take from society, I am glad to inform you that at some points in my life I have been in receipt of housing benefit and income support. You may also be interested in the fact that over the past five years I have paid nearly half a million pounds in tax to the Government, at the correct rate.

I do this gladly, and I dearly hope that it goes to those who may need help or support of a civilised society rather than to tax breaks for multinationals.

Ade is not as clinical a finisher as JD, but he does a much, much better job of occupying the centerbacks and bringing in other players into the attack, thereby improving the attack as a whole, which is somewhere JD is still pretty deficient. Can he do a job for us? Yes. Will he score 18+ goals given the opportunities? Of course he will. But the difference is JD will score 18 goals and assist maybe 4 or 5 while Ade might not score quite as many but directly contribute to 10+ in addition to whatever goals he himself scores, in addition to helping us retain possession much better. They're both very good players, but both very different. Going forward I think we'll see more of Ade than Defoe, but if JD miraculously learns how to pass, then who knows?

Life is inherently unfair. Resentment, jealousy and scapegoating breeds seperation and mistrust. This kills society.

Personally, I do not claim to be able to judge who is deserving and who is not. How can one see the whole history of the 'two people with no kids who both work'. Could there be a hidden history, or problems that are not apparent on the surface? Mental or other health problems?

So I think we should be cautious and slow to judge. But of course I fully reserve the right to be wrong. I have been very poor, and quite rich. They are pretty similar but when you are rich there are less people hassling you, you have more control over your life, and no-one judges your status of 'deserving'.

The point about debt aversion is a valid one, but since its all based on future income its not as bad as the headline figure makes out. Its basically a graduate tax, not a debt as such. 

As a future student you should be more annoyed about the sizeable cut to the teaching budget. You will have to pay more than I did (graduated this year) and will most likely get fewer courses, less contact time and fewer staff. This is particularly true of the arts courses, which had pathetically little contact time anyway.

Returning to the class question, the vast inequality in peoples education *before* university applications even begins is the problem there. We are very much still prisoners of class when it comes to primary and secondary education, and in retrospect thats probably what the anger over fees was really about (in addition to the scraping of EMA).

true,lonely_puppet,null,null,"I'm tempted not to explain my theory. But you terrified me with your dalek response but before you all shoot me this is completely speculation and should not be believed. My thought (/fun little pet theory) is that Clara Oswin is Jennie. Now I bet you all are sort of scratching your scalps and calling me a nutter butter but hear me out I'll start with the weaker side of my argument (suggesting my whole argument isn't weak) well the promo poster (wish i could find it but I'm on my phone) seemed to make a direct reference to one of the older original posters of William Hartnell and Susan, Moffatt being as he is it could have been an allusion to something so in the beginning I thought oh bs is the doctor really going to go visit Susan?
  Then asylum of the daleks happened and I threw that idea out the window. Through out the episode Oswin kept grilling the doctor on his personality very slyly and indirectly seems as intrigue or a further desire to see if he's trustable. But to me it really seemed like she was looking for something in him but there was something eerily familiar about her personality. I couldn't put my finger on it until that last line. It sounded so playful so familiar. She had to know him but it is more playful than Susan ever would be to granddad but who could it be? Something else grabbed me, her chair.
  I couldn't put my finger on where else I saw it but I figured in a show with thousands of space ships , what's a chair? Then I got on reddit (shock) and I saw a post showing the chair was Jennies. I thought first ""lol nice coincidence"" but then it sort of hit me.

Really? You *really* need to ask that? That's fucking insane. 

You could (and people do) write a book on why education is fundamental to the success of society and civilisation as a whole!

I believe that as a society we should encourage everyone to reach their maximum potential, whether that is in sports, the arts or science..... Maybe you could further human knowledge or understanding by going on holiday for three years, but you are *far* more likely to realise your potential if you are educated. So while individually it is someone's right to receive education to the highest level that they are able to study, it is also in the best interests of the country.

It's a pretty precise opinion that segways you nicely into a seat at university to read $whatever, but doesn't reflect the rest of society.

There are clear benefits to a society of having a population of educated individuals, but don't mistake being educated for being valuable. I know it sounds absurd, but I think a lot of people these days are becoming educated to the point of uselessness. Nursing in an example of this. Nurses do *not* need a degree, they need an innate sense of compassion, duty and initiative. I hear constantly of 'old school' nurses trained in the old nursing colleges of yesteryear telling me how the NHS puts students through university to become nurses, only to have the majority of them disappear back to university to study post-grad nursing and then become teachers or just quit, and not become nurses. In the meantime, staff have to be imported to meet the the demand shortfall.

SMEs need entrepreneurs, not Business Administration middle-managers. Why is the same free or super-low interest public financing not available to anyone to set up a new business? 

Rigging the progression of young adults into a one-size-fits-all railway line to *Uni*, in the name of 'everyone deserves to reach for the stars' is misguided and is going to cripple us as a society, as people offset actually working and generating tax revenue for spending an extra decade in education.",0,1347833797,null,0,1347834078,0,c693upl,t3_zz2mi,t1_c693upl,t1_c693k6k,null,1429915220,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

So yeah, I totally agree, education doesn't necessarily have to take place at a university, and my mum is a nurse, and her experience is too far from what you have said. University gives you a particular type of education it is not better or worse than any other (well, it is better than some), there are some subjects you have to learn at university, and so you go there to study them.

I also think that the students joining university now have by far the best deal in terms of tuition fees than anyone in the last 10 years.

""With regards to your view that the NHS reforms amount to part privatisation, I can assure you this is not the case. NHS hospitals will remain part of the NHS and publicly-owned and private healthcare providers will not be able to ‘cherry-pick’ services. The provision of healthcare services will be based on quality, not price, better reflecting the needs of patients and not private providers. Monitor, the healthcare regulator, and a new NHS Commissioning Board will produce guidance on how choice and competition should be applied to services and Monitor’s powers will be strengthened to protect services being subject to competitive abusive practices.

 

The purpose of the NHS reforms is to deliver the clinician-led service which too often in the past has been an unfulfilled aspiration.  The Bill will ensure that healthcare professionals will be responsible for people’s health services - by putting doctors and nurses in charge of NHS resources, rather than managers. It is also why they are driving forward with plans to create NHS Foundation Trusts – free from Whitehall control – as well as removing the top-down process-driven targets set by the Government which have done so much to interfere in clinical decision-making. In their place, the Government has established an ‘NHS Outcomes Framework’ which will free doctors from targets and focus the NHS on the most important task of all – delivering better results for patients.""

true,Inequilibrium,null,null,"&gt;Seriously, who thinks 'It was a phase' is an insult to the lgbt community?

I found it insulting. There's such a huge stigma associated with bisexuality, and a large part of it is the view that it's a ""phase"". Considering it was her first crush (and not a brief departure from existing heterosexuality), it made it even more strange to treat it that way. 

And I think that, especially for all the kids watching, it's harmful to promote that kind of perception. Even if it WAS a ""phase"" for Oswin, there was no reason for it to be written that way.

Edit: I love how straight people are downvoting the people who are explaining why bisexuals find the constant treatment of our identity as a ""phase"" to be upsetting. Really shows that you respect the views of marginalised groups, when you're telling them what they should and shouldn't be offended by. Because you have such a strong understanding and empathy for their experiences and the discrimination they have to deal with.

1)  what do you mean by ""true ability""?  If someone maybe doesn't do so well in the exam first time around, goes away, works hard and objectively gets better at the subject, and gets a better grade, then their ability has improved.  End of story.  This is not a bad thing.  What's wrong with allowing people a chance to improve?

2)  How do you know?  Have you used to to try to use GCSE grades to distinguish people?  Are you sure you can tell ""good"" from ""top""?  GCSE's get such a broad range of abilities thrown in that you can't expect them to have a super high resolution.  We're lumping in Bazza who bunks off to smoke weed and Cecil who reads calculus books for breakfast, and have 6 letter grades to differentiate them.  The good and the best will be separated later on, by further exams or university, as the standard gets higher so the resolution of the exam will increase.

3)  I disagree that the module system was what caused the statistically improbable results of recent years.  It seems more likely that the absurd fact that we have competing exam boards (we give the most A grades!  give us your business!) played a big part, given as there's evidence some were basically telling teachers exactly what was going to be on papers.

true,WhoMouse,tardis,TARDIS,"&gt; - Distinct lack or corn everywhere

I agree, but they could have used wheat as well.  It's pretty prolific as well, and looks good waving on camera.  Heck, just prairie grass would have been good.

Fun fact: what we Americans refer to as ""corn"" isn't corn, it's maize.  The term ""corn"" actually refers to the most popularly grown cereal in a country/area (which just happens to be maize for the US).  So ""corn"" could be barley, wheat, oats, or maize (among others) depending on the area you live in.  :)

&gt; - Desert

Again - I agree, but you have to remember that these are *supposed* to be the same areas that ended up having the Dust Bowl about 20 years after they stopped being the ""old west"".  A bit of drought/dust is to be expected at times, and it can resemble a desert for the unaware.

But yeah...it was a desert.  

&gt; - ""Mexico's 200 miles south""

Texas could be in the midwest, if you count the frontier strip.  It is a line from N to S midway west in the US.  Just saying, today's ""midwest"" isn't necessarily what they considered ""midwest"" in frontier days.  Plus, Texas actually has desert areas - to go with your last point.  

Besides, there's people like my parents that even today mix up ""midwest"" and ""bible belt"" (considerably different areas, but being part of the ""bible belt"" is more acceptable to them than being part of the ""south"") and just basically combine the two, with a bit of ""old west"" thrown in.

&gt; - Distinctive Old West style

I don't understand this point.  Anything west of the Mississippi during the 19th century counted as ""old west"" or ""wild west"".  This includes areas of the Midwest and the South.  Heck, just look at the Arch.  Very much in the Midwest, but still very related to the American Frontier (the ""Old West"").

i think as the season progresses, better defenses will cut down on the number of chances we get, which may amplify defoe's mistakes. there's just no way we're going to have 22 shots and 11 on goal against city or chelsea. so when defoe pisses away a chance, it may cost us more in the future. 

because adebayor contributes more as a complete player (as far as passing, holding the ball up, creativity etc.) i think he might be the better choice against the top teams. defoe would be great late, when we need a goal, and of course for some starts against teams like reading etc.

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"I thought Luiz had a brilliant game against QPR, he had a few marauding runs but showed that his game is maturing, with some no-nonsense, safety first clearances. I don't feel there's a particular need to drop him. Not sure if JT is 100% but there's no chance he'll be sitting this out. The back five will remain the same IMO, Cech, with Ivanovic, Luiz, Terry and Cole in front of him.

Mikel to start at CDM, very deservedly, he's been solid the past few games, one mistake aside. I think we should start considering other options for CM but I don't think this game is the one for it, so Lampard starts once again. Maybe against Stoke we give Ramires or Romeu a go. 

Up front, Hazard and Mata are guaranteed. I wouldn't mind seeing Moses on the right wing, thought he looked good, but having a defensive winger might not be a bad idea because Juve will pack the midfield. Having someone to chase down and disrupt their possession would be useful, so there's a decent chance Bertrand or Ramires will get the start over him.

I hope Sturridge gets more minutes, he looked lively in his short cameo. To be honest it might be good enough to warrant Torres being dropped but I don't envision that happening.

Starting XI: Cech; Ivanovic, Luiz, Terry, Cole; Mikel, Lampard; Ramires, Hazard, Mata; Torres

A good example of the logic here is the recent attacks against American embassies and our allies over some stupid anti-islam film. The US believes that whether by law or by coercion, no entity should be able to silence anyone simply because they have the force or authority to do so.

it has been speculated that everyone will ask the question ""doctor who?"" however it has also been speculated that the doctor will ask everyone ""doctor who?"" (as though his own memory had been wiped or erased or lost)

in both cases silence will fall because of the inability to answer the question, again however, speculation has it that silence can be a literal thing where nobody can answer, or that the religious order will fall.

Now he's willing to kill people or just make sure they die. I think he was first so adamant about trying to save people because he felt guilty about the timewar. 1200 years of carrying that guilt and trying to save everyone has worn him down until he's reached a point where he snaps. Where he no longer feels the pain of the timewar or he has become so used to it that he has become a much darker person.

•Bring back Jenny. I know, over- used, shoot me, but I think it would be an amazing episode, and especially the look on the Doctors face would be priceless.

•Something in India- based. I don't know what, but India has plenty of mysteries which would make great episodes.

Lastly.

•Native American and their battles? Just throwing ideas here.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"Well, the people who they are forcing out got their houses because they were also unable to provide a suitably sized house for their children. We are talking about social housing tenants being moved around, not private owners/renters being kicked out by the government to make way for social tenants. Ultimately the problem is that since it's inception social housing policy from both Labour and Conservative administrations has reduced social housing from the ideal of being affordable state owned/backed property for the masses to purely being the landlord of last resort. The whole system is purely geared towards providing housing for people who can't rent privately or own property and that is what it has to focus on. So even if people were given a property on the basis that it was a home for life, reality has moved on and they will need to adapt. We have a housing shortage, and if someone has a big house they aren't using it will need to be re-issued to someone with a greater need. And society has a greater need to ensure that we sort out the lives of kids before their environment screws them up and they grow up into shitty adults.

It is also worth pointing out that a lot of people lost their homes since the financial crisis started through no fault of their own, and it wasn't a case of irresponsible behaviour leading to kids they couldn't afford to house.

Lastly, this is a good example of why being reliant on the government isn't a good thing. The idea of ""society"" caring for you cradle to the grave might sound nice, but all it will ever lead to is the government screwing you over. It might take a lifetime to happen, but it always happens. This is why the entire welfare system needs to be retooled so that it can work to reduce the need for it's own existence, rather than doing the bare minimum it can do to prevent people from dying as it does now. We need a system that is there for people when they fall on hard times, but focuses on getting peoples lives back on track.

true,Aspel,silence,Silence,"And you're watching *Doctor Who* why, then? Shouldn't you be off doing something other than getting distracted by things of lesser importance?

I also find it incredibly ironic that you use the ""there are more important things"" argument and talk about how much suffering there is while arguing with me about suffering that the LGBT community faces. Brava. See, you're using the common fallacy that many people who are against the discussion of LGBT issues use. The one where ""there are more important things to talk about"". Except that we're on a *Doctor Who* fan site for fuck's sake, and we're talking about a civil rights issue. Shit, we're not even talking about that, we're talking about me saying ""actually, that is a phrase that people do have reason to be offended over"" and you're all ""no, it isn't"" despite the fact that you're talking out of your ass while I on the other hand am actually of the party that would be offended, i.e. we're talking about LGBT peeps and I happen to be one of them. Second, you're apparently of the mind--at least as far as this argument goes--that someone can only have one topic or area of discussion that they consider important. And, while, yes, I do obviously hold the civil rights issues concerning the treatment of queer individuals in this country and other progressive countries to be one of my primary concerns, that by no means precludes me from thinking that Citizen's United was one of the worst rulings ever, and that the current abuses of it by the political machine are putting America on the edge of collapse, or that bipartisanship (and specifically the conservative block) is likewise ruining the country.

Basically, you're an idiot. I know you're not supposed to attack the other party in a discussion, but the thing is, I'm attacking both you and your argument. Your argument isn't wrong because you're a dick, your argument is wrong *and* you're a dick, which just makes it worse. It's not that ""boohoo, someone said something mildly offensive"", it's that you're actually denying that the people in question even have a right to be offended. And you've now brought out the ""there are more important things to complain about"" argument, which, as I've spelled out above, is frankly offensive in and of itself. Are people really falling for that? Are there people who would say ""you're right, I shouldn't talk about the way that society mistreats gays and doesn't even consider their feelings, I should focus all my efforts on bringing peace to the middle east!"" Because I don't think I know anyone who'd give in to that argument.

And while we're at that, again, why watch *Doctor Who*, then? Why be on Reddit? Why aren't you off doing something more important? Oh, that's right, because you're just being a fucking dumbass. This right here? *Doctor Who*, this subreddit, most of Reddit? This is my safe space. This is the place where I don't have to put up with being considered a second class citizen. This is the place where a lot of people don't have to put up with that. It never comes up. Gay, straight, black, white, whatever, it's a fandom. You like the source? You're invited. But, you see, sometimes the source can forget that it's got fans of all types, and, well, language being what it is, colloquialisms, etcetera, sometimes words get used that can come off as having a different meaning than intended. So, yeah, if some queer fans feel hurt by something that *has been said to them to cause hurt in the past* from something they considered safe, something they saw as loving them and accepting them, then they have a legitimate right to be a little upset. Maybe not turning away or lighting the torches and gathering up pitchforks, but yeah, a little slighted, like when your girlfriend turns to the side and gives you the cheek. Or when your boyfriend forgets something important to you.

Oh, and now that I finally caught up to speed and remembered the line in question? Yeah, Osrin saying ""it was just a phase"" really did kind of smart. It was cute and funny for her to say, but at the same time, it kind of hurt my feelings. I don't think it was meant to be anything more than just a colloquial little wink and a nod, but it still hurt all the same. And I'm allowed to have that hurt, and that hurt matters. I have a right to be offended by things like that. It was like being teased by a friend. Like they said something mean, even if they didn't realize it.

So get your Goddamned head out of your fucking ass and don't ever use that cheap shit argument of ""there are more important things"" ever again you ignorant little shit. Not unless you actually want to fucking put your money where your mouth is and talk about something more important, and get off your ass and actually *do something more important*. Grow the fuck up. This is a fucking television show's subreddit. Don't give me the fucking ""we should be complaining about politics"" bullshit.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Additionally I think Lampard has also been under-performing at the start of the season and it may not be entirely a stylistic issue. I remember there being a similar issue at the beginning of last season. IIRC he didn't look good until around October, he bagged some hat tricks, then his form tapered off a bit then he finished strong by playing well in our big games. The season before last I remember there was a period during the winter fixture pile-up under Ancelotti where he wasn't his usual self either and we really suffered.

We have to be smarter about using Lamps. If he has to play 3 games in 10 days or 4 games in two weeks then we cannot expect him at 100% plain and simple. IMO he should have been rested against QPR. He played two full games for England over the international break. If you include the QPR match he played 270 minutes in 8 days. Given that we will likely need his experience in the CL opener you can make that 330-360 minutes in 12 days. At Lampard's age ironmen Scholes and Giggs were making 12-15 league starts a season. Still instrumental to the team but there was a proper way of utilizing them.

I think it is also clear that he does need a little more tactical discipline. His defensive stats so far are quite poor, and his passing % is actually one of the lowest on the team thus far and I would like to see him have more touches and passes than he currently does (I know only 3 games so far but still). Something's gotta give. If he wants to play the Lampard role and make his runs we need to play him less so he has the energy and sharpness to get up and down the pitch. If he wants to play more games and play against the more offensive teams he will have to make adjustments. 

I hope for our sake he can fine tune his game. We want him in the squad for the big games like Man United, Man City...but he will need him to be more disciplined to be a viable option for those games.

Imbetween each conflict, it can be assumed there is little to no conflict in what the Doctor is doing.

We know that the Doctor takes companions to beaches (Amy went to Florida in space I believe) and to luxury hotel type planets (Donna went to one while the Doctor solved a mystery). He has times of pleasure and relaxation between conflicts, as it is assumed, but usually there is someone to relax with him- to talk with him, joke with him, ect. 

And now that Amy and Rory are not traveling with the Doctor between conflicts, he has more time alone than ever. When he asked Donna to be his companion, we heard him say ""I want a mate"" as in I just need a friend. Now he doesnt have any steady friends which I can assume takes a toll on him emotionally.

One reason why I am going to be ready for the Doctor to say goodbye to Amy and Rory is because they are constantly worrying about their lives back home.

We move to an interior shot. Still Gallifrey. The golden sky burns outside the window.  Eight is putting the final hand on a machine. A woman appears from the shadow. Romana played by Lala Ward. She's older and more regal. This once Lady President of Gallifrey is now nothing but another Timelord in hiding. Hiding from the madness of Rassilon and the madness of the Daleks.

Doctor: You can leave with me.

Romana: These are my people. I will not abandon them.

Doctor: There is no hope anymore. I won't allow Rassilon to destroy everything the Timelords ever stood for. 

Romana: You ran away from what the Timelords ever stand for. You are running away now.

Doctor: I'm doing what has to be done. Come with me. The Timelock was put in place before you arrived. You can still leave.

Romana: You can stay....Go down with Gallifrey...

Doctor: I'm sorry Romana.

He flicks on a switch. The Moment starts to make noises and the entire planet starts to shake.

Romana: You will never forgive yourself.
Doctor: I know.

Eight runs away from the explosions. Outside the building we see the TARDIS. As Eight approaches it the light at the top starts to flash. 

Eight: No no... It's useless! The timelock prevents anyone from leaving. 

A voice from the Tardis booms out. John Simm's Master.

Master: Gallifreyan technology stabilized my body. Now all I needed was a way out. Much appreciated Doctor.

As the Doctor looks at the Tardis dematerializing we fade into the opening titles.

The Tenth Doctor is having a good time with Donna Noble. They both run into the TARDIS and slam the doors shut behind them.

Donna Noble: You... are... mad!

Doctor: It's just a pointless cup. 

The Doctor takes the Holy Grail from his inside pocked.

Doctor: Can't really see what's Holy about this.

Donna: So what's next?

Doctor: Julius Caesar or perhaps Winston Churchill? He always liked me... Well when I say liked I mean he liked my TARDIS. Still Winnie's always good fun.

Donna: I want to meet Madonna.

Doctor: What? I give you all of space and time. Every person that ever lived and you want to see a popdiva?

Donna: Oi! You told me I could pick and choose this time. You wanted the round table. I want ""Like a Virgin"".

The Doctor scoffs and moves to the console. 

Doctor: Well then... off we-

The Tenth Doctor collapses. 

Donna: Doctor?

The Doctor groans. He starts to fade out.

Donna: What's wrong? 

Doctor: Great chunks of my past, detatching themselves like melting icebergs.

Eleven is sitting in his Tardis when suddenly the phone rings. He picks up.

River: Oh good... Doctor... This is an e-

Doctor: Hello sweetie.

River: There's no time. 

Doctor: What's wrong?

River: Look at your hand.

Eleven looks at his hand which becomes transparant.

Doctor: Time is being rewritten.

River: I can already feel my memories change, Doctor. Adventures I know we had we never had.

The Doctor flicks a few switches on the TARDIS and....

SOURCE OF PARADOX: Gallifrey 

Doctor: Gallifrey... Right at the very end of it.

River: You'll need help.

Doctor: Who can help me?

River: Oh... You know.
Doctor: That would mean crossing my own timestream.

River: Creating a paradox? I think we are beyond that now. I have coordinates for 4 to 7. Nine is gone but we can still salvage Ten.

I just find it incredibly implausible that Moffat and other writers today would use it as a reference point because, firstly, it was written in a bid to reveal the Doctor's past and encourage new viewers back to an ailing audience. The Doctor's past being a wonderful mystery which seems to keep us glued in this new series.

The BNP has basically become defunct now, but the same regrouping can be seen as the EDL forms. 

To me the message seems to be that the core demographic now realises that attempt at a respectable public face and political goals was ultimately a failure and have somewhat gone back to their roots.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;As far as I can see, the conversation rate thing was an attempt to encourage it, not stop it.

The conversion rate thing was to stop people crossing the border to buy stuff cheaper and as a result paying UK taxes instead of Irish ones. What will happen if the same thing occurs in Scotland, for example? Suddenly the money in/ money out equation goes out of the window. For the Irish, the Euro exchange rate made a big difference too, it wasn't just the VAT (both combined = ouch). As for it still happening - why wouldn't it be? Ireland is still in a far worse situation finanicially than the UK is.

&gt;The rUK opinion on independence is not really relevant

For independence itself, no - but we're talking about the outcome, not the beginning. It'll certainly be relevant for the Scots if the outcome isn't good - they *won't* get to decide who foots the bill (or how big it is) if things don't work out, and that's before we get to paying for re-entering the union. I'm also not sure of comparing Scottish independence to other independance drives from 100 or 300 years ago, either - todays political and economic landscapes are totally different.

It's worth remembering that Scottish politicians aren't suddenly going to be a breed apart, they're going to be just as greedy, manipulative, self-serving, two-faced and *occasionally* effective as the politicians everyone has now.",0,1347871053,null,0,false,0,c69bwih,t3_zlrht,t1_c69bwih,t1_c666yjd,null,1429919079,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"At the beginning of the very first episode of Doctor Who (An Unearthly Child) Ian and Barbara are discussing Susan and Ian mentions that Susan's grandfather was a doctor. So he might have put that on some paperwork for the school that Susan is attending as his occupation. Seeing that the Doctor is very angry about Susan attending the school, it's possible that Susan put that on some paperwork, rather than the Doctor. I don't see him going out of his way to help Susan get into the school.

 Throughout the first couple of episodes Ian refers to him as ""Doctor Foreman"" and the Doctor says ""Why do you keep calling me that? Doctor who?"" After that, Ian just starts calling him ""Doctor"". Then the Doctor starts calling himself that. 

Over the years it has been implied that he chose the name before the 1st episode, most specifically in his phone conversation with the Master in ""The Sound Of Drums"". However there has been nothing in any episode to suggest that it is some name that Time Lords receive as a graduation present. That is pure fan fiction as we have seen more Time Lords with proper names than titles. 

Also, Doctor Who has no canon. Concepts within the show have evolved and changed over time. What might have been true 50 years ago isn't necessarily true now. You have to remember that we the show started production, the BBC didn't think there would be any interest to rewatch episodes. That's why so many are missing. So they didn't care about continuity.

Suarez has by agitating referees, agitating players and creating controversy sadly gotten the refs against him.

So there was no victory in abolishing a local government tax altogether; but this was never the demand of the campaign.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"I was at a talk recently [Crime Writing Festival, in Harrogate], about the impact eBooks are having on the publishing industry. Those on the panel included:

* Steve Mosby [Author].
* Stephen Leather [Author].
* Philip Patterson [Literary Agent].
* Ursula Mackenzie [President of the Publishers Association]

The two authors - whilst disagreeing, were clearly both advocates of eBooks. Of the two Leather was open about the fact his books are regularly pirated, and how he perceives it as ultimately being to his advantage, as it'll introduce readers to his work, a surprisingly large percentage of whom will then go onto buy his books legitimately.

The whole event / talk was overshadowed by Leathers' revelations about how he promotes his work - the use of ""Sock Puppets"" on various social networking sites / forums, to generate ""interest"" about his works.

For me what was more interesting - particularly in relation to the topic of this thread, and the issue of piracy as a whole, were the comments from Mackenzie. Part of it was recorded for Radio 4 - unfortunately I don't have the recording to hand, but chief among her points:


&gt; Selling books at .20 is an utter, utter disgrace. It's having a hugely detrimental affect on the book industry, and depriving authors of the revenue they're due.

She's referring to the likes of Amazon, who sell books for as little as .20 - some of which are still on sale as hardcovers for £18.99

What she failed to mention, is that the authors whose books are sold for .20 are often times still receiving full royalties. Amazon are selling those ""units"" at a loss - they're essentially loss-leaders, a concept that pre-dates online stores by a good number of years.



&gt;DRM is an absolute, absolute pre-requisite.

When challenged by Leather about how DRM is pretty useless [It really is - a simple pyton script will remove DRM from Amazon / Sony / Nook ebooks without any difficulty] and that in actuality, DRM was more of an inconvenience to people who were buying the books, and who wanted to move them between other devices? She didn't really have an answer to that.

It's also worth pointing out she's contacted authors in the past, and told them selling books without DRM would lead to a ""staggering"" increase in piracy.



&gt;She talked quite excitedly about how many .Torrent sites her organisation had closed down, and how they regularly issue take down notices to those sites. She decried them ""profiting off the backs"" of authors hard work.

Again - the standard assumption that people who pirate content do so exclusively to generate revenue.

As I'm sure we all know, the Doctor normally tries to do things in a way that lets everybody live. He tries to settle things nonviolently. One thing that I've noticed is that the Doctor has a tendency to get really dark and very vengeful when he spends time alone or deals with evil things for too long. My friends and I have dubbed this ""the spiral"" as he is spiraling down into a really dark, no mercy sort of attitude. The spiral with David Tennant was slow, but he ended up in a really bad place calling himself the ""Time Lord Victorious"" and taking the gun from Wilfred in the End of Time Part 2. As he spirals he always seems to end up with a gun in his hands.

In this series it seems that the spiral is much faster, at least from our point of view. In the second episode, Dinosaurs on a Spaceship, the Doctor just lets Solomon explode in his own ship, killing him. In the third episode, A Town Called Mercy, the Doctor is ready to throw Kahler Jex over the line and let him die.

I definitely don't lack computer skills, though I probably lack a few computer skills that some other people consider basic because e.g. I've never used Facebook.

Point - the problems aren't all about computer skills.

If you want to reduce peoples access to services, you first make sure that the employees they talk to don't have authority to provide those services and have been trained not to talk about them. But the terrible thing about employees is that they're people too - they can learn things they're not supposed to, and they have empathy and other inconvenient traits.

Putting people on the end of a phone helps reduce that problem - it's easier to manage empathy when your employees never see the faces of the people they're ""helping"". But still, there's tone of voice, and there's the human ability to understand awkward problems and figure out how to help rather than letting those people fall through the cracks in the system, which of course defeats the point of creating those cracks in the system.

Replacing phones with the internet helps solve those issues.

In short, if you really need help, you're a bit more likely to get that help if you phone, and far more likely to get help if you can talk to someone face-to-face.

It also reduces costs, of course - but only by making or keeping people unemployed who could have been answering telephones or even providing face-to-face support in a jobcentre. Meaning that instead of the cost of paying an employee, there's the cost of keeping someone on benefit.

Anyway. Insurance companies will do what is known as 'growing the book'. This is something that is either done weekly, monthly, or quarterly, depending on financial figures at the time. The insurance company will require a certain level of business coming in in order to ensure they remain financially viable. They also need to be mindful of taking on too much business, as the likelihood of two of their drivers having a collision with each other makes for a financial risk too burdensome to carry.

Imagine if you will a graph, running from left to right. At the bottom left corner of the graph will be point A, this is the minimum amount of money that an insurer needs to be bringing in. Now image further up on the left, there is point B. This is the maximum amount of business that an insurer wants to take on. in between points A &amp; B will be a line, running left to right, that will fluctuate as people leave for other insurers and people join. The idea is to keep that line somewhere between points A &amp;B.

If too many young kids join that particular insurer, they will price young drivers out of the question. now, they can't refuse to offer insurance, so they will just raise the price to a level that no-one will buy insurance for, thus lowering the risk, but also lowering the line down towards the number they need to maintain in order to earn a profit. What they'll then do is offer a bigger 'introductory discount' to elder drivers, and they'll bring in more middle-aged customers, and put the line back up towards point B.

I'm not sure if this makes sense to you, but the TL;DR is that they need to price some customers out of the market in order to ensure that they're not taking on too much risk, and sometimes they will run introductory offers in order to grow the book following a period of slow sales. This is why your premium fluctuates so much in such a short space of time.",0,1347878502,null,0,false,0,c69cip2,t3_zvkkq,t1_c69cip2,t3_zvkkq,null,1429919369,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,LS69,eng-yorkshire,We are Leeds,"&gt; The driving test is to simply teach people to a certain level to be able to drive.

And GCSEs teach people to a certain level in order to be able to work. GCSE English &amp; Maths is a standard requirement in many jobs.

&gt; They don't distinguish top, middling and just passing drivers with it - the ability to manipulate modules means it doesn't reflect your true academic nature.

I'm guessing you've just done your GCSEs.  You should know that they are used for : 

* Demonstrating basic abilities such as reading and arithmetic to an employer.
* Demonstrating a basic ability in a subject in order to study it in more detail.

They are not used for measuring your academic e-peen with global academia. That's what more advanced exams are for.

&gt; I would limit it to only one resit and reduce the length of time allocated to teaching GCSEs to two years 

You're talking about throwing kids on the scrap heap at 16 if they fail an exam.  Being unable to get to grade C in the core subjects seriously hinders your life, far more than a lack of driving licence does.

I'm sorry ""thick"" kids end up with the same grade as you. But they have demonstrated a work ethic that is very important to the real world

There is nothing wrong with allowing longer time to study a course, there is nothing wrong with allowing multiple resits.  More academic qualifications such as degrees may deal with this more rigorously, but GCSEs are about learning basic life skills.

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"&gt; no one needs a major label to be successful anymore 

 This argument is a fallacy and a byproduct of internet naivety to be honest. 

Now before your blood boils and you start to formulate a direct salvo dismissing that statement let me at least try and explain why. 

I work in the music industry, have done for two decades and I've run half a dozen labels in my time, some successful, some complete flops, I've also had two major deals as an artist. Now as much as I dislike Major labels, as an artist you can only take yourself to a certain level through self promotion and that's the level of getting a major to notice and therefore getting them involved in your work. Once you have major labels and publishers involved who'll pump money ( and lots of it ) into your work - promotion, videos, distribution, tour support, radio pluggers, campaigns, street teams etc. etc.  and more importantly collection of earnings )  will you then start to make it as an artist earning a decent, livable, long term wage. There are exceptions as there are exceptions to any rule, but these are few and far between. 

I will add that I've never met one artist on the brink of big success who has turned down a major record and/or publishing deal through their own moralistic standards and gone on to do anything. Not one. I have a good friend who turned down £250,000 from Sony thinking he could make the money himself. Where is his now? Working in Tesco feeling a little sorry for himself, that's where.  Ed Sheeran played this game, made the right move and now he's signed to Atlantic, part of Warners with a few £mill in the bank. 

Also, any artist who makes money without the need for a major label ( NIN and Radiohead for example ) have already had the help of Major labels at some point in their career to do the dog work i.e. they've already made it. 

Basically you unequivocally need money and connections to make it in the music industry as you do in all industries and you need lots of them, otherwise you'll just find yourself pissing in the sea trying to make waves. You can not do it on your own. 

Believe me, I've been there.

Now on this occasion one of the 'NuPlod' had previously been with the Friday night shift dealing almost exclusively with the pubs &amp; clubs chunking out and responding to calls from bouncers and the like.  Keep in mind my friend is a black belt in Judo and over 6ft tall. 

Now this guy wades in, finds the suspect and absolutely does not back down.  He then starts shoving my friend around trying to incite a response (i.e. shove back and start the fight).  His supervisor was just stood there in mouth open horror until an Asp was pulled at which point my friend says words to the effect of ""Get him under control or I will!"" and NuPlod is jumped on by his supervisor and shift buddy, dragged off and told to BEHAVE!

CSB yeah?  Maybe.  My point is that he went in to that encounter with preset ideas about what he was going to find and was more than happy to throw the first punch.  Needless to say he both failed the course, had to apologise and was sent back for remedial training in dealing with the public.

Some drunken yout' getting taken down by the cops is what they are after, not 45minutes of an officer calmly talking to some drunken kids who then go home without incident while the officer goes back to the station for a cup of tea and a new biro. The fact that your friend reported that the trainee officer was admonished and sent back to training shows that the reality of police work is different to the TV show.

However, in the defense of the police, they spend their time day in, day out dealing with the worst of society. It's their job description. Anyone who is put in a situation where they are constantly getting shit from a large amount of the people they interact with is going to end up with a somewhat skewed view of society and other people, and as a result they aren't going to react to situations in the same way that you or I would react. We see the same problems, although far more severe, in the military. This is why combat troops are cycled in and out of theater after 6-18 months, to give them a break and to prevent things like PTSD or other behavior problems. But (AFAIK) the police don't do this, they just have the same guys doing the same jobs for years at a time, which is going to slowly institutionalize them. Logistically this is a hard problem to solve but it would be worth looking at the idea of a ""tour of duty"" combined with periods of R&amp;R or less people focused work. I'll fully admit this is just a theory but it might be something worth looking at.

I'd also add that a certain type of people will be drawn to police work, where as people with far more relaxed attitudes might not even consider the career path at all. This might be an issue with the recruitment process, or it might be a problem with the nature of the job. But the Coppers episode set in the countryside showed a very different style of policing and people, a far more relaxed and open approach. This might just be something that wouldn't work in the cities or more urban areas without a huge manpower increase that no one wants to budget for.

On the one hand it made sense logically because it moved towards paying per person, and therefore more related to what services are used.

Lunch would be dependent of where we were/what we were doing.  e.g we went to a theme park so got chips for lunch and a drink for about £3-4.  Other days we'd go to a 7/1, get a sandwich and spend about £2.

Dinner was where the real cost was - roughly £15-£18/night.  But that was top-notch stuff like steak and chips in a slightly fancy restaurant.  But we did go to a nice Irish pub where a Toad in the Hole was about £8 (with drink).

There is a [great card] (http://www.visitstockholm.com/en/stockholmcard/) we got which was an initial ~£45 but gave us free entry to the museums, free transport, kayak hire, and more.  We broke even relatively quickly, and make a fair saving on top.  I'd definitely recommend it.  Also, you get a free guide book with it, which is fairly helpful.

You've been to uni, what were you studying there?  I assume you have moderate to good grades from GCSE/A-Level?


Internships/apprenticeships would be good to get you in to a good industry, work hard and push for a permanent position by the end of it.


Go above and beyond in your job, when that buzzer hits 5pm and you can go but there is still a little bit of work to do (even on a Friday) stay and finish it, let the boss go home first so they know you are a consistently hard worker.


Where do you work at the moment?  Can you push for a more permanent position there?  What training does the company offer (always ask this in interviews, makes you look good) that you could take to help boost your position.


Near where you live, is there a specific industry that is strong?  I live near the Thames Valley so electronics is quite prominent however car industries can also be a big one.


How about people you know?  A lot of people get jobs not through what they know but who they know.  Is there a relative or friend who you can ask for help?  Even if they can't they can always keep their ears and eyes open and give you a strong reference if they do see something pop up.


Keep pushing yourself in effort and what you think you can achieve, don't settle for a minimum.


Try hard and the very best of luck, it's a horrible place out there but if you're determined enough, you can do it.  Don't give up!

true,[deleted],null,null,"The question of music piracy is always one that has astounded me.

It's always the ""big"" stars that seem to cry poverty almost when reports of piracy are made or articles are always made about how it's the multi-millionaire music stars that are suffering.

Take this article for example. I'm sure the hundreds of thousands of records Ed Sheeran has sold and the hundreds of sell out gigs he's performed have put a nice amount in his bank account. 

Now admittidley, if he has produced this music and put effort in to it then morally it is not right for someone to download it for free, however I'm sure the amount of people who attend his concerts and bought his music legally is a far greater number than the amount who have obtained his music illegally. I also think it would be safe to say that a good percentage of people who illegally download his music will attend his concerts and it's a well known fact that musicians in his position make the majority of their money on live shows and merchandise rather than CD sales.

Articles such as this also portray music piracy in a negative light and never actually portray the positive effect downloading illegally can have.

I listen to a lot of music that could be considered ""underground"", a lot of punk, hardcore punk and similar bands.

A lot of these bands never release their music in the UK and have no distribution deals with even small labels so the only way to hear and own their music is to download it illegally from a service such as Soulseek. 

Eventually if said band were to play in the UK, then it is possible to support them and buy their CD's/merchandise etc. directly from them.

Personally I have done this on many occasions and when it has been possible, bought the physical copy of the music I downloaded when the band have come over to the UK. Sometimes this could be many many years after the inital release so, as stated above, the only way to obtain this music is through file sharing. 

In this instance, this will be a good way of exposing bands who have no set fan base in the UK and the file sharing has been a positive thing.

true,Rider_0n_The_Storm,BE,belgium,"As a person who's deeply interested in unusual football tactics, and thus watching a lot of Juve with their rarely-seen-nowadays 3-5-2, I can add a little bit about them.

- Their wing-backs can be deadly with their runs forward, especially Lichtsteiner. They can really overcrowd our sides and create a numerical advantage. However, if we deploy offensive wingers (Hazard &amp; Moses would be really good), that would force the wing backs to sit deep throughout most of the game, and not support their attack. If they support the attack anyway, we can take advantage of the space they'll leave behind.

- With Pirlo and Vidal in the middle, we are very likely gonna be dominated in that part of the pitch. Obi Mikel and his partner (most likely Lampard due to experience) have to really be on top of their game. It'd be great to have the old Essien to counter the presence of Vidal, but, oh well. 

- Similarly to Liverpool, they have no good no. 9. Vucinic is decent, but that's it. That means we shouldn't have the ""Falcao problem""...

- ...however, Giovinco - their supporting striker - is a tricky little (literally - he's like 10cm smaller than Mata (!!!) player, and - unfortunately - the exact type of player Terry struggles with (e.g. Tevez, Suarez). We really, really have to watch out for him.

- Due to the menace of Vidal, we won't have much time in the middle, so whoever starts as our 10 (most probably Mata, could also be Hazard, alternatively Oscar) should be moving from wing to wing and supporting whoever is on that side. Overriding their wings with combinations such as Cole-Hazard-Mata and then working the ball to the middle from the wing is the way forward, in my opinion.


Overall, should be a tough but tactically very interesting game. In Torino it'll certainly be a struggle, in London I'm counting on 3 points. But it's still group stage, and I don't see us having trouble with Shakhtar or FC N..., so no result on wednesday will really be tragic.

As for pharmacies - my point is that they are also run for profit, and make millions every year. But they don't screw people over.

So saying that any privatisation of healthcare leads to patients being screwed is completely false, as proven by two for-profit sectors of healthcare which function just fine.

My point was that grading on the bell curve would not have a *large* impact on the proportion of people gaining each grade.  
  
But I do oppose bell curve grading, and it's largely because of that small change.  It makes it more difficult to see any progress in teaching methods - or government policy - if you simply set the proportion of each grade.  In choosing bell curve grading, the government would also be specifically stating that command of the subject is only relevant compared to other people taking the exam that year.  The fact is that there will be *some* variance in the average level of competency in each subject in different years, and bell-curve grading means that simply taking the exam in two different years, and being compared to two different sets of students, could result in different grades.  If two people in two different years get the same grade, you should be able to say that they have a broadly similar grasp of the subject.  With bell curve grading, you are less certain of that.

true,[deleted],null,null,"* GCSEs are not simply about teaching everyone to the same basic standard - they are used for differentiation also. Otherwise, why would any student attempt to achieve greater than 5 C grades?

* You need at least 5 C grades including maths and english to progress onto my local A level sixth form, lots of kids are thrown onto the scrap heap already. It's about allowing other pathways into the workplace to flourish, I think apprenticeships are scorned at too much - university is seen as the only path into work - and I think that is wrong.

* GCSEs have been used for years by the universities to distinguish between students - I vaguely remember Birmingham university needing about 7A*s at GCSE to even be considered for their medical course, not demonstrating just ""basic ability"". Many courses include GCSE minimums according to competition, the greater the competition the greater these  requirements.

* You have to start distinguishing at this age, universities have had to revert to looking at GCSEs because even the A level system is beginning to strain with everyone achieving similar grades.

* So the idea that the GCSEs sole purpose is to educate everyone to C grade level is not what society needs. Society needs to cater for the C grade kids and the A* grade kids.



* I want to make absolutely clear - I do not want to revert back to the O level system. Children are NOT being split into two tiers under the new one like the old O level system - kids are simply taking hard exams done under one sitting. They should be allowed to resit these exams. 
It is about evolution, we have to adapt the education system to mounting worldwide pressures to keep our kids competitive.

* I do not disagree that academic ability is more accurately measured at A and degree level. You are correct. I simply assert that the GCSE system needs to be more fair in terms of all children studying the course for the same amount of time ( because some schools are teaching GCSE material a year earlier than others to get a head start! This is not fair! How is that possibly in anyone's best interests? Some kids should not be allowed more time to study the exam material. ), modules to be less vulnerable for manipulation in terms of resitting a module too many times (the point of modules is that you can do better in the next module to improve your overall grade) and better exam content to distinguish top students.

* The current system does exactly what you call for, it IS teaching people very, very well to a basic level of education. This is the GCSEs success, however it is lacking in separating smart from brilliant. Many university courses have introduced other criteria for you to enter their courses now, because everyone has the grades - the UKCAT and the LNAT had been in use for many years now, as well as interviews.

* I am not calling for kids to be thrown on the scrap heap, I never made that claim; I think kids *should* be allowed to resit in the new system and have more than one chance. I don't propose the exams to get harder than C grade; only higher grades. And to be honest, many countries would laugh at the fact our sixteen year olds are simply learning basic life skills at that age.

* I do not see why the new system would not educate everyone to a basic level of maths, literacy and science - we should take the good ideas from the conservatives. The old O level system would be terrible, but aspects of it is needed to cater for our growing population, increasing competition and increasing ability of students from around the world.",0,1347893050,null,0,false,0,c69ellb,t3_zytzd,t1_c69ellb,t1_c69cp0g,null,1429920418,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

People are campaigning and using all of this dramatic language about privitisation, but the fact is that we've been living with huge sectors of the NHS already privatised and we don't have any problem with it. GP surgeries, pharmacies (and dentists too btw) are all privately run and work well, providing decent services which the public are generally happy with. Not all of them are perfect, but that would be the case whether public or private.

I don't think there's any reason to believe that a walk-in clinic, hospital or any other sector of the NHS couldn't be as effective as a GP, dentist or pharmacy.

true,daveduckman,null,null,"I thought there was some good and some bad. Some of 'backstage' footage of how the players spend their time, the insides of Melwood, the little things they do in training (like the 'world cup') were interesting. 

However, there's plenty that makes it cringeworthy. Mostly, it's obviously for an American audience and so it has a lot of simplistic aggrandisement of Liverpool FC that really isn't insightful. The nature of the editing and production values are also clearly 'Americanised', the music is particularly cringeworthy.

It clearly is about selling football to an American audience first and foremost, and so I don't think it has the right tone for a british audience or long-term football fans.

My biggest insight from the documentary is from the access to the owners, which has been far greater than offered to more traditional supporter groups and to the UK media. They clearly view the sacking of Dalglish as a sort of emergency release button they always reserved the right to press (reinforcing that Dalglish was never their choice). Maybe their mainly playing a PR game of not saying much, but they really said a lot without saying anything. Also Ian Ayres irritates me more and more each day.

I'm curious about where it's planning to go in the rest of the episodes. I thought they had been filming from the second half of 2011-12, but that also just seemed prologue for discussing Rodger's new reign. Now I have no idea what they're going to discuss for the most part - more training? the transfer deadline fiasco? our poor start to the season?

Finally, I don't think you can call something a ""fly-on-the-wall"" documentary if the entire series has a narrator and it is primarily a series of interviews with the subjects. For a true fly-on-the-wall football documentary, I recommend ""QPR: 4 year plan""

Overall, I'll definitely watch the series because there are plenty of good little clips, but overally I am definitely not the target audience for this documentary.

It's more with the fact that one of the only mentions of bisexuality that the show has had for years is as a ""phase"". It reinforces that perception.

And, as I've said, it makes no sense. *She liked a girl before she liked any boys.* The line didn't even fit well with her character. It was put that way for no reason except to dismiss her romantic history as not ""counting"" - just making it a quick gag, when it could have been funny *and* a good part of her characterisation. It portrays her as yet another heterosexual (like pretty much everyone on the show aside from some one-off gay characters) who was just confused/on the fence. Which is how bisexuals are treated by large parts of society, both gay and straight.

For those who blindly accept those stereotypes, it reinforces them. For those too young to even understand sexual orientation yet (considering Doctor Who has a *lot* of young viewers), this, along with all the other bullshit on TV, is going to influence how they form their views. It doesn't actually matter that Oswin's sexuality is totally legitimate regardless. It matters what message it sends, even if it's not intended.

In terms of physical numbers, I must say that I have no idea what the minimum requirement is for the TSA, but there is a lot of stuff online in terms of help (i.e. [here](http://www.admissionstests.cambridgeassessment.org.uk/adt/tsaoxford/Test+Preparation) ).

For the management side of the interview, I think that they are likely to ask you about shit you've done in the past that links to management, but they can also throw in some curveballs.

Other than that, there's all the usual stuff about keeping 'extra-curricular activities' to a minimum etc. but you can find that on other posts here... Also, there is quite a lot of writing on the course, Id say as much as 60/70% is essay/long answer based.....

For example, on the weekend I went to an event called the Open Source Hardware Camp. There I met people who were in charge of giving out money (vouchers) to motivated people who were trying to start ""digital"" businesses. Find events, attend them, network. Events are full of motivated and inspiring people. Find mentors, buy them a beer, talk to them.

There are always government programs helping people to start business - which leads to employing other people.

Look online about how to start a business.

Read [The Four Hour Work Week](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/). It sounds and looks like toss, but it's FULL of practical advice about how to change your mental state and how to run a business in the modern day. I can't recommend this book enough.

Even though your country is in a recession, it doesn't mean all is lost.

Recessions bring out the creativity in people. It's also the best time to start a business because everything is cheaper and you can negotiate better prices from suppliers in a recession.

Start by asking yourself: ""what are my problems, and how do I fix them?"" and then design a product around that. chances are that someone else has the same problem and will pay you money to provide a solution. 

Want to know what people want? Go to Amazon.com, look at their [Best Sellers list!](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/bestsellers). Never before in history have people had access to so much information about what consumers are consuming.

&gt;Of course, but I believe that the real ones at fault are the record companies themselves. Even before the days of mass pirating, stories of bands being screwed over existed. With or without piracy, these companies earn outrageous amounts of money of which a laughable portion goes to the artists themselves.

What proportion do you think they're taking? Every contract I've signed says 50% and that seems pretty fair since the label are doing all the mastering and promotion for you. If the release is a physical one then 50% is an amazing deal as the label is taking a large financial risk (depending on size of label). 

&gt;Before seeing piracy as the problem, I think it's important to look at the infrastructure of the music industry itself first.

Why can't we look at both of these things at the same time?

As someone who saw his first release on a torrent site on its day of release it’s pretty depressing to see people justify piracy for the good of the artist, the only artists who can benefit for this are much more mainstream artists and most of the time the reason giving your release away is good for the band is because the press releases to go with this new free EP/Album cause more publicity than a normal release through notoriety. An unknown artist wouldn’t get featured in music news publication for this reason because it’s not newsworthy. 

In order to find new music, different genres have different systems, in dance music that way would be by DJ’s playing new artists in sets or podcasts. the only way to make this happen as an artist is to sign up with a label who has the chance of getting the attention of the influential people in whatever genre that might be. Artists aren’t necessarily very good at promoting themselves, they are, first and foremost, artists and if that has to change (as it seems to be) into artists that have to multitask as promoters too then music won’t be judged on quality primarily (by a label who vets the quality for release) but on who is better at shoving their music into your face.

When companies can give people a better service than this, they will use it. It's just how things work, you can't complain about people using a way better service than you provide.

The popularity of iTunes, Steam and Netflix is because these companies found a better way to distribute than their competition. People aren't morally obligated to go buy an album for £15 when they can buy the song they want instantly for 70p.

The solution to piracy is:

* 
 To accept that the problem will never be eliminated. There will always be people that can't afford it and want it free. You can lower this number, but it will not go away.
* 
 To be better than the competition, be it legal or illegal. It's how business works. I buy games from Steam because it's cheap and convenient enough to be worth paying for.

&gt; I assume you missed the entire Jack/Gwen love story arc of Season 1/2 of Torchwood?

Yeah, I was too busy noting how Gwen was with Rhys, while Jack and Ianto were totally in love with each other.

&gt;He was a 'guest companion' for 3 episodes in 3 and 2 episodes in 4. That isn't a minor role. That's being a main character for those episodes, his appearance in The End Of Time? That's a minor role.

Jack wasn't a main character in Journey's End, that's clearly a stretch. And your nitpicking isn't really relevant here. Jack was a companion for a chunk of season 1, reappeared a couple more times (and had a cameo), and *isn't on the show anymore*, which was the actual point I was making. Nobody in Doctor Who for the entire Moffat/Smith run ever seems to acknowledge having had relationships with both sexes without considering it a ""phase"".

&gt;Jack also makes regular passes at men and women showing his attraction, just because there isn't a sex scene for every single person he talks too doesn't mean he isn't attracted to them.

I'm not talking about sex scenes, I'm talking about romance or relationships, or at least the explicit acknowledgement of their existence.

You're typically required to pay for each module prior to taking it. That means saving up money, dropping a few hundred pounds on a course, and then working your arse off to pass. There's no refund if you fail.

But maybe that's not for you. The DWP have their ""[Get Britain Working](http://www.dwp.gov.uk/policy/welfare-reform/get-britain-working/)"" scheme, which could be helpful to you. Attend these Work Clubs, or seek Work Experience in the kind of field you want to go into.

You mention CCTV operation- [LG Careers](http://www.lgcareers.com/careers-az/cctv-operator/) work with local government to fill roles. They say that training is usually provided by the council. You should ask around, see if your local council is looking for anyone. It might be unpaid, or an apprenticeship, but it's also free experience, which you can then put down on a CV.

But maybe that's not for you either. That's okay. Your local college has courses you can take. Night classes in Microsoft Office. Childcare courses. Construction/Engineering. Hairdressing. Just pick something. At the end of it you'll have a piece of paper which you can show to prove you can do these things, and that'll help you to get a job doing that thing.

There are other training opportunities, too. [Pitman Training](http://www.pitman-training.com/) have premises all over the UK and Ireland, and offer training in all sorts of fields. Have a look, see what you can find.

Keep in mind, though: It's not going to be easy. And it's not going to be free. But if you're to get out of your current situation, you're going to have put in time, money, and effort. It might even take more than three years. But at the end of it, you'll be much better placed to provide both yourself and the woman you love with the security and comfort that you wish for.

Oh, in which case you are throwing kids on the scrap heap.  GCSEs are not like A-levels and degrees. They measure basic abilities as well as being academic measures. 

You cannot limit the number of times someone tries to pass English &amp; Maths as they are essential to the world of work.  It doesn't matter if someone ""manipulates"" the resits to get a better mark, because it demonstrates an excellent work ethic, and no one who does that is going to be competing at A* level for a medicine degree.

Once you hit degree level and lose honours by resitting, then you are seperating people academically and that's fine. But any exam at 16 has to be used in the workplace as a basic skill measure and you can't cut  people off from that.

Shit like this Reddit. You didn't read my entire argument, you picked the points that went with what you were saying regardless of context. Don't. It's bloody annoying.

Where the fuck did that come from? Read the paragraph below where I point out it's a ridiculous assumption to highlight the fact that all you're doing is making ridiculous assumptions when it comes to Moffat and his writing team. 

You obviously didn't watch the same show as I did where Gwen was struggling to remain with Rhys due to her attraction to Harkness and the real Ianto/Harkness fooling didn't begin until Season 2 after she had announced her wedding due to the fact he had effectively walked out on her, thus ruining her perception of him as a reliable male figure more suited to her new life style. 

Jack was a main character, it's just that there were a lot of main characters for the duration of that story as it was an RTD fan service, that fact he was in the opening credits reinforces the assumption I'm making.

Nobody in the entire Moffat/Smith run? Give me a break. Please. This is their third year together. Third and they put in a little quip which references something thousands of male and female people go through. Many people have a 'phase', it isn't an insult to your culture, those who think of themselves as bisexual/gay/transgender. It's a joke to those that had that phase. I would much rather that they introduce that bisexual/gay/transgender character as part of a story rather than shoehorn it in to satisfy people like you who just complain as routine. 

Romance and relationships. Jack and Gwen as stated above which you effectively ignored, Jack and Ianto also have a relationship, thus your bisexual representation. 

To finish off, get out of your tiny little corner and try to appreciate the opinions and views of others. Not every joke is targeted at you personally. Learn to take a step back and appreciate that what you find insulting, many find funny because they've had a different experience.

I will outline my position on resists here:

* A student under the current GCSE system should only be able to resit each module *once* in the two year period. IF they do not pass, they can retake the qualification the following academic season. ( However this scenario is now unlikely because of the new system being introduced)

* A student under the new system has to resit their big final exam the following academic season. They can resit again the academic season after that as well. etc.

So - ultimately, if you cannot pass the qualification, you have to take it all again. You could do it in the first exam period of the next academic season (for module exam structure): September after the summer for example. Or the year after with the new system. 
This wouldn't prevent people from gaining these qualifications. 

And, personally as a medical student - Even to be able to find a route onto a widening access course, multiple A*s are needed to show ability. Unless there were extenuating circumstances, the widening programmes are as popular as the course themselves. The requirements to apply to widening access scheme are based on family income, whether or not they are the first generation to study at university and pass rates of the secondary school they attended.  
Once they have applied; academics, a personal statement and an interview is needed to separate the applicants.

Not every pregnant women eats ice cream by the pint. I was recently pregnant myself. Between conception and delivery, I gained 12 pounds. By a week after delivery (giving a few days for the swelling to go down), I'd lost 20. And I was slender (BMI 23, well within the normal range) to begin with. I just made a conscious decision to eat well and followed through with it. 


In Amy's case, since she was unconscious the entire time, I assume they put her on some sort of nutritional drip that provided just enough calories for her and the fetus. There's no biological reason a woman needs to get chubby while pregnant; it's not like the fetus grows in her butt. 

&gt;  not even the slightest ""whoa your boobs have gotten bigger"" jokes (unless I'm forgetting something)


You'll note that when Amy was still caring for Melody in ""A Good Man Goes to War,"" [she was wearing an unusually loose and stiff shirt](http://www.fanpop.com/spots/amy-pond/images/22904595/title/amy-6x07-good-man-goes-war-screencap). This could obscure breast growth as well as being easy to nurse with (since it was loose enough to just lift when needed), presuming Amy breastfed at all. If she did, her milk would have run out and her breasts might have deflated to normal size within a few days of losing Melody. If she didn't, the deflation would have happened even earlier, within a week or two of delivery. Also, ""Doctor Who"" is a family show -- when have they ever made a joke about boobs? 


&gt; Babies do things to your body,

True. Even if they hadn't been traumatized by losing their infant, I highly doubt Rory and Amy had sexy times immediately after ""A Man Goes to War."" Some women can, but it's difficult to survive a vaginal delivery (which we assume Amy had since she was told to push) completely unscathed. 


&gt;  I'm not sure they could be out of order 


Agreed... I think. :p Possibly reversed order from the Doctor's POV, but not the Ponds'. If it was the reverse for both of them, it would make no sense to show the story in that order. I think we're seeing the Ponds chronologically because that's what we've seen in previous seasons and I think the point of the companions in general is to give the audience something ordinary to anchor to.

I'm 27 and currently training to be a radiographer.  It's not something as well known as other health professions (eg nursing / physio) but in a way that's good as there is less competition for jobs.  It's also a proper skilled job in that you need a recognised qualification in order to do it, and once you have that you can work most places worldwide.  You can either take a 3 year BSc or 2 year MSc, half of which is on placement, and is entirely funded by the NHS so no course fees.  Bursaries are fairly limited though so you probably need someone to support you as you train.

The job itself starts as mostly taking xrays, with opportunities to progress and work in CT, MRI, ultrasound etc.  The technology keeps improving too so you've got to keep up to date with it all.  I'm absolutely loving it.  I get to work with lots of different types of patients with different problems, and also get to work with some pretty awesome machines.  Obviously you get difficult patients (abusive, dementia, drunk, very ill, etc) but you just get through it and on the next patient.

I know this sounds like a bit of sales pitch but it's something I hadn't even considered until about a year and a half ago and currently couldn't be happier!  I actually feel like I'm making a difference at work instead of just answering the phone.

You cannot blame it on your school though. From personal experience, the people who I know who were able to get onto an access scheme had at least a few A*s at GCSE. Not a huge amount, but no one had less than two at least. Obviously personal experience is not the best evidence, data would be needed.  
But I think that illustrates my idea that everyone who is even applying to the access schemes - not competing with the private school kids; had almost all grade As and a number of A*s at GCSE, and they all claim to have gone to underachieving schools. 

This is why most medical schools require you to take an external test, either the UKCAT or the BMAT for another layer the differentiate with.

I have heard anecdotal evidence that the BMAT is far harder than the GCSE exams were; showing the extent to which universities have to push the students to see who is slightly better.

I think it is a good thing, it shows how bright the students of Britain actually are - and we can push them further by making the higher grades of the qualification slightly harder to get.

The problem with all these sites is the same.  They were designed specifically because department level websites didn't share information that they had on similar subjects between them, so information you wanted was scattered around on different websites with no links between them.

Direct.gov and businesslink were built so that the links would be better.  Unfortunately they both ended up having the same problems as before, but with a common header and footer, because departments were poor at talking to each other and linking up content.  You effectively had silos of information within the site.  That's fine if everyone arrives at the top of the website, but people rarely do - 75% or something at BusinessLink (my DG peers said something similar for them) ended up at a fact sheet pages low down in the site and then it was impossible to navigate back up to find your information.

I'm guessing that Gov.uk will have the same problem.

At about 12:40 in [this radio show](http://www.hypable.com/2012/05/30/steven-moffat-has-a-plan-when-doctor-who-gets-to-regeneration-13/) Moffat states that the Doctor has twelve regenerations/thirteen incarnations, and they're on the eleventh. When they're about to run out, he'll hit the ""emergency 'make something up' button"".

I think he's warming that button up this season; Eleven will continue to grow darker, tempered less effectively by companions. This darkness, potentially combined with the circumstances under which Eleven parts with us, will manifest as a darker Twelve. Throw in the re-introduction of the Time Lords, who have the mechanism to add regenerations to a Time Lord, but are generally unwilling to do so, especially for the man who twice Time Locked them. This would also allow the Master to re-enter the story and split the Doctor and the Valeyard (perhaps triggering the ""final"" regeneration). The struggle between these four parties could culminate in Thirteen gaining extra regenerations, probably in the climax of a series finale, and probably right on the brink of death.

My guess at a metaphor would be that the flickering Light Bulbs represent The Doctor fading from this universe. An ""Idea"" going out.

Another interesting bit would be from the line Rory drops at the end of Dinosaurs on a Spaceship. He attempts to replace the bulb he and his father were working on but discovers that the bulb wasn't bad and maybe it is the socket that is bad. I see a Metaphor for The Doctor and the Ponds from this. The Doctor is vanishing from the universe not because hes being forgotten but because he never belonged in the same universe as Amy in the first place (It is not the bulb but the socket its in). The Crack in her wall, The two point of space and time that should never have touched were The Doctor and Amy. 

The Doctor is not native to the universe we observer him in. Technically hes been ripped from it before at the end of season 5. It may be the only reason he still exists in it at all without the crack is because Amy had re-imagined him as 'belonging' there. But he is still not native to the universe and this is why he is unable to visit the Ponds without large chunks of time passing by in between. Time revolves around Amy in this universe not the Votex/Tardis. Its possible even that his anchor to the universe is Amy.

true,Skyblacker,rory,Rory,"&gt; I just can't imagine being under that kind of stress, between having a baby and then it being taken away etc, and not showing any sort of visible aging or stress related health things.

Not everyone responds to stress by comfort eating, and it's possible that for companions the Doctor chooses people who strike him as emotionally resilient, who might do better under duress. Also, even if Amy is stressed, that might take a long time to physically manifest itself. I mean, Kate Moss still gets modeling work and she's been a cokehead for years. If art directors can airbrush out those city miles, a stressed-out Amy could seem absolutely fresh-faced. 

&gt; Side note: I don't think any other of the companions have worried about visibly aging, have they? 


I haven't seen that mentioned, but then I've only been watching the reboot so I can't speak for classic Who. However, other redditors have done the math and realized that the Doctor's Ninth and Tenth carnations didn't last longer than 20 years combined, while Eleven seems to have gone for 300 years so far. So it's possible that the earlier companions never got a chance to travel as much with the Doctor as the Ponds have. 

&gt; I like your reverse theory better than out of order, considering that's what the Doctor's relationship with River has basically been like all along.

That theory isn't original to me, but I'll admit that it also made me think of River.

It's a balancing act, that more or less works very well in our country. There needs to be a bit of a redesign of the law, as many people are ignorant to the issues of using social medium and how this relates to the current law. 

Take for instance, [this kind of story.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jun/21/facebook-incite-riots-mitchell-stancombe) Would he have ever said anything like that in public so that everyone could hear?

There is still this worldwide view that just because you're online, it doesn't matter. These are the type of people that fall prey to these laws, not political rebels, not pioneers, not those standing against the crown.

The law does need a touch of redefining for the use of online media, and people need to be made aware that the internet is not the anonymous place they think it is. But on the whole, I think our country functions better for it. It certainly doesn't need expanding on, but I feel free to speak my mind as I choose.

This year, I'm down to 7 exams, and can make up the rest in continuous assessment (project, reports, etc), and that's going to help me no end.

In real life jobs, one has to do projects, team-based work, and report-writing. Taking away these from the education process is just fucking ridiculous.",0,1347905578,null,0,false,0,c69hq8k,t3_100x8w,t1_c69hq8k,t1_c69gqmf,null,1429921890,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6
