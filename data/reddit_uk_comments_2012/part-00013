They concluded:

1. Workfare is least effective in getting people into jobs in weak labour 
markets where unemployment is high.

2. There is little evidence that workfare increases the likelihood of finding 
work. It can even reduce employment chances by limiting the time available 
for job search and by failing to provide the skills and experience valued by 
employers.

3. Welfare recipients with multiple barriers (stuff like childcare) often find it difficult to meet 
obligations to take part in unpaid work. This can lead to sanctions and, 
in the most extreme cases, the complete withdrawal of benefits that leaves 
some individuals with no work and no income

4. Subsidised (‘transitional’) job schemes that pay a wage can be more

Then you have the electricity and gas companies, whose products are all precisely the same energy coming down exactly the same pipes/wires, but all charge different prices, all making a profit. I fail to see the necessity of a free market in that scenario.

They are busy reconstructing the big road junction outside my flat as part of moving the underground services prior to installing Edinburgh's trams. I get to see a lot of what ""the guy who digs up roads for a living."" does. I've not taken my own photograph but [this](http://jeziorki.blogspot.com/2009/04/do-not-take-this-road.html#links) is quite typical. One worker in the cab controlling the JCB, one in front spotting for him. 

At the Haymarket junction one JCB breaks up the surface with a pneumatic hammer driving a 4inch diameter metal spike. Another JCB with a bucket picks the rubble out of the hole. No spade work.

There used to be pick and shovel jobs, digging up roads and the like, but there seem to be very few of them today. Lots of unskilled jobs have just gone. Even the semi-skilled jobs have gone. Think about electronics assembly. The solder paste gets silk screened into place, the pick-and-place machine adds components from reels of 5000, then the vapour phase reflow machine solders them in place. The ordinary jobs, putting the dual-in-line packages through the holes in the circuit board and soldering them in place have all gone. And I'm badly out of date - vapour phase reflow might be old-hat for all I know.

In the typical media frenzy of a major international tournament, their is no way that he will be allowed to forget his upcoming trial and it will just increase the pressure and focus that the whole team are under.

Of course, it doesn't help that the role of Captain of the national team has been endorsed with so much utterly irrelevant 'importance'.

true,wizzi,null,null,"As an England supporter and a Blues supporter, I have to side with the FA on this. There is already unrest in the England camp over the racism allegations and I think it would make things much, much worse for the squad if JT kept the armband. 

Innocent until proven guilty is one thing, but when the situation is not resolved there are still tons on questions being asked and tensions at an all time high. As a manager, it's not about doing what is right for one guy, it's about doing what is right for the entire squad. Capello has never done this. He's always played his favorites. In a big tournament like this, with the overt unrest, and refusal to strip JT the FA must step in. As bad as I hate to say it, JT appears to be  troublemaker around the England camp (shagging his teammates women, calling press conferences at the WC without the manager's approval, racial allegations). He's a rock in central defense on the pitch, but that's only part of the game. Having teammates around you that you don't fully trust is a big mental hurdle that you can't even expect the best professionals to deal with art all times.

true,AManFromDoncaster,eng-manchester,Manchester,"I was in from 1999 until 2004.

At that point, there was a massive skills gap lower down the ranks. The reason for this was that a mass wave of patriotism seems to have struck in the years following the Falklands conflict, and sometime in the late 80's/early 90's, they suspended recruitment. This effectively meant that they had an uneven structure, and it was very hard to get promotion to certain levels in certain ranks. Furthermore, if you displayed any kind of aptitude, you were effectively tied to your ship for the full 4 years.

I did my taskbooks extremely quickly, and moved from my first ship to my 2nd training course after just 4 months. They cross-trained me from a type 22 to a type 23 platform, and after joining my new ship, i completed my task book within 2 months, yet they wouldn't release my for my killick's course. They did make me a local acting leading hand, but i didn't want to be in that branch. 

Despite receiving multiple commendations, and acing every test i took, they wouldn't release me for my actual leading hands course, and they wouldn't allow me to cross-train again as a weapons engineer. My friend joined the RAF as a junior rate. Within 3 years he was a non-com aircrew on the Nimrods, acting as a weapons system operator.

I wanted to progress quickly, and the Navy was effectively anathema to that. If i had joined the RAF, i think i would've been extremely comfortable and well paid in a pretty high rank by now. 

Also, there are not a great deal of qualifications which you can gain in the navy which will transfer to civilian life, or have an awful lot of use. The majority of the marine engineers i knew who left around the same time managed to get onto training courses with Rolls Royce (our ships have RR turbines engines) but they were the lucky ones.

&gt;Simon Dawkins, 23 - returned from a good spell with San Jose Earthquakes in the MLS - he finished an impressive 21st in the Castrol Index Player of the Season rankings (his team mate Chris Wondolowski was 1st, Thierry Henry was 3rd, Landon Donovan was 16th, Juan Pablo Angel was 25th, David Beckham was 69th).

And in September:
&gt;Simon Dawkins is a regular starter for San Jose Earthquakes, where he is on loan until December. He has now made 15 starts and 7 substitute appearances for them since March, including five starts in a row since the end of August.

&gt;Dawkins was recently included in an article called ""24 under 24"" on the MLS website:
&gt;""One of the most exciting new arrivals of 2011 in MLS. The Englishman — on loan from the EPL’s Tottenham Hotspur — has shown he is capable of providing a jolt to the Earthquakes attack with his ability to keep opposing defenses on their heels. His speed, quickness and aggressive dribbling have made him an ideal support forward or playmaker, helping to fill the void left by the departure of Geovanni. However, injury setbacks have limited Dawkins’ contributions after he got off to an explosive start to the campaign.

&gt;What the TDs and coaches say: “Excellent dribbler who can break guys down on the dribble … He’s not a guy you want running at you … Scores and he’s hungry for it … When he’s on, he’s a difference-maker on the field and it’s all based on the dribble. He’s a decent passer, but it’s all about the ball being at his feet … He looks to pull the trigger and if you give him time and space he can hurt you … If he’s not facing the goal, he’s less of a threat. His weakness is playing with his back to goal.""

Also, the government is well aware that a number of EU regulations regarding competition will come into play once the market is opened up to private companies, which will fundamentally alter how the government is able to administer and control the health service.

Add to that the fact that the commissioning bodies will be free from geographical responsibilities and will be able to pick and choose who they provide care for.  I fail to see how this can lead to anything other than a massive decrease in provision for those in poorer areas at the expense of the rich, who will be able to pay for some kind of public / private hybrid in order to ensure the best service.  The choice that is being provided is not to the public as to who they want to provide service, but to the service providers as to who they want to provide service to.

I suppose we shouldn't expect him to cut down on his beer either. Because, you know, it's difficult to give up being an alcoholic.

I suppose you're going to suggest that he's addicted to SKY movies as well. I mean, all those action movies get the adrenalin flowing. Easy to get addicted to that.

Any more excuses you could make on his behalf that I've missed here?

I smoke roll-ups. The last time I was made redundant (twice in my life so far) I cut down from 50g a week to 12.5g (around £2.80 at the time down from over £11). It wasn't pleasant to have to cut back to that, but I had fuck all choice. The reason being that, not having kids, I got my £60 quid a week and nothing else. Not even housing benefit, because I'm one of those idiots who eventually chose to buy rather than rent.

And before you criticise me for not giving up completely, which I'm sure you'll attempt to do, I'll point out that my tobacco money was actually coming from my small savings and small redundancy package (so sue me for allowing myself a very small luxury that didn't actually come at the tax payer's expense). If I'd not found work, I would have little choice but to give up.

Now here's a thing.

He's been unemployed for 11 years. If he'd put JUST £100 a YEAR away from his fags/booze/movies/phone money, he'd have £1,100 to put toward relocation or retraining. Is THAT too much of a sacrifice to make? Especially as he and his wife had one less child to feed all the way back then.

Imagine if he'd put away JUST ONE MONTH'S WORTH of fags/booze/movies/phone money for those 11 years. He'd have £4,400 toward training or relocation.
I can keep doing the maths on it, but I'm going to assume that you know someone who can do it for you without me having to waste my time.

true,Sjreed,null,null,"I'll happily put across some pro-arguments. Firstly it is hardly surprising that GP's are against reform, my local surgery is open 30 hours a week, slow and buerocratic and have a pretty poor service, whilst my GP takes over 100k a year with a final salary pension. Do you really expect them to vote for a bill which makes them have to compete and do more work. 

As long as it remains free at point of use I have no problem with private providers being able to compete and provide healthcare. If they were, I'm pretty sure GP's could wipe out vast overheads and provide a personalised home to home visit service for example, working remotely, this is the same for many other services and something many people would prefer.

Secondly if there is competition and easy entry in the market for providers, the amount they can profit will be limited as customers will only use the best rated services and as a free service the successes will be the companies who make best use of the money provided and create efficiencies (not just take as much profit as they can).

Thirdly it will allow providers to manage their staff for maximum benefit to the user. For example they can provide specialists for very specific things, such as heart surgeons that operate the same procedures everyday or clinical psychologists specialising in very specific areas ect. This is not the case for at the moment unless you live in London. 

Fourthly the NHS has to adapt, it's just not possible to keep going the way that it is. The country has some warped perspective about it being a perfect system, it isn't, it's expensive (1/6 of all tax receipts), poorly ranked in comparison to many other European countries that have introduced competition and lacks innovation and choice. I hate the way that everyone compares this bill to moving towards U.S healthcare when its actually more like moving towards European healthcare systems such as France and Germany, which happen to have some of the best outcome figures in the world.

Bring on the down votes. I'm not sure the bill proposed is perfect and some key areas need protection, but the left wing media and Labour twist the argument so far that it becomes hysterical hyperbole to the point where people don't even discuss it properly.

What happened to patients ?

I can't believe in this day and age when the answer to pretty much most criticism of corporate greed is ""we have to protect the interests of the shareholder"" that we'd even consider letting a private company run our healthcare.

Why on earth would anyone invest in these businesses unless it was to make money ?

true,leondz,eu,Britain,"Alright, I'll bite. Thanks for putting across your pro arguments.

Your first point is a bit of a straw man; my surgery's open 45 hours a week, always has same-day appointments for urgent things or a space within a week, offers a wide range of clinics and non-GP services, and is happy giving referrals when required. Here we are both looking at samples of size one - a terrible statistical method that tells us nothing about healthcare on a sociological scale.

Competition is fine, as long as quality isn't sacrificed. It's well know that so far, private healthcare is suitable for small problems, but for any serious medical procedure one should only ever consider NHS care, where internal standards are much higher. Rates of serious care shortcomings and lapses in the private sector are consistently higher than those in public healthcare, and staff qualifications and training lower; it's cheaper that way. We already have quality issues in private healthcare, and the bill provides no fixes on that front. That's a very serious concern. As for GPs wiping out overheads, GPs have run their practises as businesses for a long time (why do you think yours is so lethargic?), with income proportionate to the amount of care given and GPs managing premises, staff and so on from this income. We manage to get really good healthcare relative to the rest of the world for the lowest % of GDP in Europe, so we're doing relatively well on the efficiency front.

Secondly, profit is waste. It's money that doesn't go to providing care. Highest profit means most wasteful. Should our taxes go into this system, where waste becomes private gains instead of (with the current setup) system gains? Further, there will be a years-long transition period as private service providers learn to do their jobs well, as the bidding process is established and managed, as new competitors come in and as regulation steps up to prevent recurrences of the inevitable mistakes. This transition period means inefficiency and mistakes (aka deaths and other costs). Why choose this radical new untested plan when we already have a very efficient and cheap health system that provides much better care than other countries' would on the same budget?

Your third point is a problem related to population density, not private vs. public funding models. Imagine the bill passes; will there be a cardiologist and the corresponding extraordinarily expensive cath lab in more places? Would that be profitable? Those who live far away from specialists will still have to travel for their procedures. I'm not sure what the effect of the bill is that you're advocating here.

Fourthly, the NHS has constantly been adapting, is doing well, and suffers from rapid large changes. If you remember, in the seventies and eighties it was run by only medical staff, who were unaware of finances, business practise and efficient management. The system was very wasteful and led to ineffective care. During the eighties and nineties, managers with no medical skills were integrated into the system and placed in positions of authority, and aggressive targets set. The doctors had to learn to manage, and the managers had to learn about healthcare, which gave us a fifteen year period of horrendous healthcare with minimal savings. For example, targets were instated that favoured reduced operation waiting times; to achieve these, staff found out when patient holidays were, and scheduled operations to be during these, thus achieving a high cancellation rate and therefore the goal - shorter queues. Another target was to reduce the density of people in wards; nurses removed wheels from bed trolleys and kept in-patients on beds in corridors - job done. The NHS really sucked in the nineties and UK citizen quality of life was the direct victim. After a while, the managers and doctors gained the requisite experience, learned how to set targets and then how to meet them in a sensible way, and we achieved the managed, efficient healthcare system that we have today. Of course it's not perfect, but it is very efficient (in terms of GDP - I don't know how tax receipts are calculated or how they vary between country), and suffers - just as its patients will - from sweeping policy changes.

I'm not sure what you meant by ""lacking choice""; there are multiple private healthcare providers in the UK, although often they will refer you to the NHS, which to me is an excellent indication of where the quality care skills are learned and where the best consultants choose to reside. The private services do have better coffee and waiting rooms.

Healthcare as proportion of GBP source: OECD data 1960-2008; in fact there's a nicely packaged video that also uses these figures, and doesn't originate from within the UK but instead the US; http://www.khanacademy.org/video/health-care-costs-in-us-vs-europe?topic=healthcare-and-medicine-1

In certain circumstances it can be beneficial for the Party to call an election before four years if it feels it will get more votes. Especially if it's working in a coalition with another party, as is the case now, there are big advantages to calling an election early.

Additionally, the requirement for Prime Minister is that they must hold the confidence of the Commons (i.e. be capable of passing legislation). If a motion of no confidence is passed on Parliament, the Head of State (i.e. the Queen) will either replace the Prime Minister with someone who can or call a General Election. In fact, as is so often the case with the British law, it is always *technically* the Queen who chooses the Prime Minister and calls the General Election, even in reality this is almost always the leader of the largest party in the Commons, with elections called at the behest of the current Prime Minister.

I could be wrong, but my impression is that if, say, you have a stroke, get taken to hospital, you will get assessed for speech therapy while you're on the ward, and your therapy will be outpatient. I don't think you would see your GP at all. Now, I suppose you could change it so the hospital had to refer you to your GP, and then you have to make an appointment with your GP, and he will decide whether to refer you, despite not having much knowledge about speech therapy... it sounds very iffy.

While GPs are experts in *their* respective fields, their field is only a portion of the health service. You are not likely to find any GP specialising in speech therapy because speech therapy is performed by speech therapists.

I think that there is a big misunderstanding about GPs. For most people, and for most of the time, the GP is the person you see. But that's because most of the time you have flu or you want him to look at your mole or you go for a check up or any of the myriad minor things.

It seems to me that the majority of privatisation or part-privatisation in this country has not been done in a way that meaningfully brings about these benefits in the way the textbook promises.  It often ends up giving another effective monopoly to the end user, who has no real way of voting with their feet/wallet, meaning little competition, and what efficiencies _are_ created by whatever competition _is_ created, has a habit of ending up in executive bonuses and shareholder's wallets rather than cheaper or better service for the customer, or invested in R&amp;D etc.

The devil really does seem to be in the details when these schemes are implemented.  Staying with the railway thing for example londonreconnections.com had some interesting comment on the different models of franchise vs concession between train service operators and infrastructure owners/maintainers (tfl/tubelines compared to network rail/TOCs).  Unfortunately I can't find the link, but the hopefully-applicable-here gist was that part-privatisation can work but it needs to be drawn up very carefully based on reality and not generic ""Adam Smith WOO!"" political dogma and/or the politician's wife is on the board of a relevant company, gosh what a coincidence.

As such...

&gt; poorly ranked in comparison to many other European countries that have introduced competition and lacks innovation and choice. I hate the way that everyone compares this bill to moving towards U.S healthcare when its actually more like moving towards European healthcare systems such as France and Germany

... this part leaves me with one key question, is it _really_ adopting the best of those systems, learning all the key lessons from them, and from past UK privatisations?

If you need any help in setting up your event (it should be easy) just contact me. For your event, we will have to create an event type as it doesn't exist (Cycling &gt; Road Cycling &gt; ???) so maybe we could talk about that (make it general for other people to use)

Here are some [screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/OqZhr#0) of how the design is going. The new functionality will include allowing multiple predictions per donation and users of the site have asked for people to be able to see who else has made predictions. Also, The Treat you offer will be more of a feature. At present, you enter your treat in the Invitee's Prediction Tip (your tip to your sponsors)

If you use the site before it's relaunched (March - end of), you will be able to contact people that have already sponsored you, informing them they can make more predictions (if you offer more than one, that is - max 5)

You have absolutely nothing to lose by using the site. It's all legit. Get in touch with me if you need help or if you have any questions.

true,fairenoughfoster,null,null,I just gave you a reason why the iPad is preferable to a laptop. I have a desktop at home and I have an iPad to take to lectures. A laptop is much less portable. When I mentioned doctors using them I was thinking of examples of doctors using them to interact with patients aswell as using them to hold patient information which saves on paper and creates easier integration with other computers and other tablets throughout the hospital. I like the simple OS the iPad has. It's fast and efficient and provides lots of useful features. Why does me having an iPad devalue my argument? I evidently have more experience with tablets than you do because I assume since you so obviously have a problem with tablet devices you don't use one. Apple make great products thats why people buy them. Products that provide a great user experience and appeal to a rapidly increasing market. Tablets are not useless because millions of people **use** them. This invalidates your argument. You may not have a use for a tablet. But I do. Your original argument was that touch based technology such as tablets would die out. I think that even if tablets were useless..millions of people use them and enjoy them which in turn increases demand and spurs further development surrounding touch based interfaces on future consumer electronics creating a future entirely opposite to prediction in which tablets and touch screens are more integrated into our lives than they are today.,0,1328304781,null,0,false,0,c3nmzs5,t3_p6cma,t1_c3nmzs5,t1_c3nmnq3,null,1428291590,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Faller at the first fence! GPs will be at the forefront of 'competition' when the plans are railroaded through. If the service they provide now is slow and bureaucratic (it's slow because of demand) how is enforcing the administration responsibilities of a PCT onto them going to help? They will now be able to - will have to - restrict access on the basis of who can pay.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"I think the challenge with the NHS isn't actually about improving efficiency, because the old-school centralized NHS system has for decades been the most efficient system in the world [1]. The challenge is moving in a sensible way from that bare-bones, life and death style of medicine, towards the European level of spending and the European level of provision. And this becomes a particular issue now, because we are in the process of seeing an explosion in the power and extent of medical technology, with genetics, stem cells and nanotechnology.

So reform is inevitable, but reform isn't a one-way process. It isn't a matter of 'going forward' or 'going back' until you've actually picked the right direction, and in my opinion these reforms exacerbate existing problems. And one of those is the power which GPs already wield. At present GPs are the gatekeepers to specialized, hospital care for anyone who isn't sick enough to go to A&amp;E. You go for a 15 minute interview, in that time they diagnose you from the enormous range of human diseases, using evidence from millions of medical studies, allocate the severity of your ailment, and then pick a treatment, using evidence from hundreds of thousands of clinical trials. And usually, all of this without opening a book. This is a manifestly absurd situation, and I've repeatedly seen through my family its bitter fruit. My brother was told for two years by our GP that he was making up ongoing pain and trouble breathing, before paying for a private scan which showed up a precancerous growth, which in turn meant the removal of his thyroid gland. Or, most recently, I went to the GP with an eye problem, and when I return home discover that the treatment I was given has been proven significantly less effective than another, similarly cheap treatment. And you can't blame the GPs, because how can any human possibly be considered capable of this task alloted to them?

The Lansley health reforms will mean that GPs are responsible not only for choosing where to send each individual patient, but collectively which hospital services should be commissioned, and by extension which hospital services should exist. This is a massive victory for the generalist over the specialist, and will be an ongoing and increasing idiocy as treatment and diagnosis becomes more extensive, and requires more specialization and in-depth expertise.

What we should do long-term is swallow our pride and adopt the French system. In France, if you have a problem, you go straight to any doctor within the public health system who you think can help you most effectively. If you have a problem with your eye, you go to an eye hospital, if you have a problem with your neck, you go to an ear, nose and throat specialist. The way they reduce costs is then through a co-payment system, so individuals pay a percentage of their care, which is then refunded by the government in a means tested way. That means that individuals are directly incentivized not to be frivolous, rather than cutting costs by restricting care through gatekeepers. Their level of healthcare expenditure is about 30% higher, which would mean a 4% general increase in expenditure. Until we can afford to do that, we should stop rocking the boat and just stick with the system we already have.

[1]: After all, even after the New Labour increases in expenditure, the Americans actually spend [more government money per head of population](http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=kthk374hkr6tr_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=indicator_53906&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country&amp;idim=country:22003:22103:7403:6803&amp;ifdim=country&amp;tstart=318384000000&amp;tend=1296691200000) than Britain, to provide healthcare to just a fraction of the population.",0,1328308735,null,0,true,0,c3nnphh,t3_p97qh,t1_c3nnphh,t3_p97qh,null,1428291928,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Your Government has a system in place that actually encourages people *not* to work. If I got myself sacked from my shitty job and chose to sit on my arse every day doing sweet fuck all - I would get more money.

So it's not fucking wonder the entire country is going to shit.

You get rid of job seekers and everyone becomes a homeless bum who gets sick from the shit weather and lack of food etc etc which will then chew up the NHS and rip it shreds bleeding it dry - the only people who'll be able to afford health care will be the fucks collecting a million pound bonus every year while the continue to lay off staff they ""can't afford"" - who will in turn then have nothing, end up homeless and then just die because the NHS has been run into the ground.

The reason there are so many people on benefits is because guess what bucko - there really are ***no*** jobs, or don't you watch the news?

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"Once upon a time, credit was considered shameful, but capitalism consistently over-produces (it's part and parcel of the Sloanist model of mass production) and rapidly runs out of markets to supply as it expands.  In order to keep the factories running full time and maintain the economies of the model, new markets are always needed and new solutions need to be found during periods of crisis.  Solutions have taken various forms - imperialism/neo imperialsm (forcing open markets overseas), shortening the lifespan of products, reducing the repairability/serviceability of products, fashion, marketing, and ultimately credit for the masses.

The reason our economy has been increasingly running on credit is because salaries have failed to keep pace with productivity and the gap between the rich and poor has expanded further and further.  We've supplemented the income of working people through welfare, but ultimately the competing demands on State resources, and the increasing power of big business and the rich to get their needs met out of the kitty first have meant governments have borrowed more and more to fill the yawning gap in the middle of their budgets.  Where do they borrow from?  From the rich and big business of course, the people it's become increasingly unacceptable and practically problematic to tax.  So instead of taxing and using the money to supplement the overall package for working people in order that they can provide the markets that businesses need to soak up the products capitalism churns out, instead they borrow this money at interest from the very people they would otherwise tax for it.  Ultimately, of course, that merely exacerbates the problem.

They might just have a different system up there. That clause I quoted does look quite specific, but I might be misinterpreting it. Reading further, there's a quote from David Heath, Deputy Leader of the House:

&gt; The Government will still have to resign if they lose the confidence of the House, and that will still be on a simple majority. There is no ambiguity about that. If the Government lose a vote of confidence, they are no longer the Government of the day.... 

&gt; I return to what will happen in the event of a vote of  no confidence, because it is crucial. There would then be two possible outcomes. If the Government lost a vote of confidence, they would no longer be the Government-under our conventions in this House and in common with other political systems around the country. Then another party or coalition of parties might be able to form a Government from within the existing House of Commons. That is not the most unusual thing in the world, because it happens in many other systems that have a  fixed-term Parliament. It also happens within our present system if the Government lose a vote of no confidence and it is apparent to the monarch that there is an alternative Government or coalition in the 
House. 

&gt; If no one can form a Government that has the confidence of the House, Parliament will be dissolved. Irrespective of other circumstances, if the Government lose a vote of confidence and there is no prospect  of stable government, another election is 
inevitable.

Presumably the idea is that single party wouldn't want to use that provision, because they'd have to issue a vote of no confidence in themselves, and then wait for 14 days.",0,1328313459,null,0,false,0,c3nohj4,t3_p97qh,t1_c3nohj4,t1_c3nocbp,null,1428292295,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

**Option: David Tennant**

1) Blink
2) Silence in the Library
3) Forest of the Dead

Blink is a great, because it requires very little knowledge of the show, the production values are incredible (she won't dismiss it as cheap), and it runs the gamut from screaming to laughing to crying. I suggested the other two because Donna is great, and she's likely to latch onto her storyline in the virtual reality, which is heartbreaking.

**Option: Matt Smith**

1) Vincent and the Doctor
2) The Girl Who Waited
3) The God Complex

Vincent and the Doctor has a lot of plusses here. It's gorgeous; it's simple; it's written by the guy who wrote famous hit romantic comedies she probably likes: Notting Hill, Love Actually and Four Weddings and a Funeral. The Girl Who Waited plays with time in an interesting and heartbreaking way. There are ""bigger"" episodes, but you'll probably want to show her that Doctor Who is more than aliens and explosions. Following up with The God Complex helps show the series' diversity while delivering another touching, emotionally complex story.

Depending on her tastes, you could substitute The Impossible Astronaut and Day of the Moon for the second two spots, although then you get into having to explain who River is etc.",0,1328314058,null,0,false,0,c3nokwq,t3_p9ys2,t1_c3nokwq,t3_p9ys2,null,1428292406,28,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,28

* ""In October 2008, Huhne led the Liberal-Democrat response to the government's announcement of plans to expand the capacity to collect records of people using electronic communications. The Home Secretary's announcement was in response to warnings by police and the security services that the growing fragmentation and complexity of communications was hindering their tackling of terrorism and organised criminality. But Huhne disagreed with the government's response to the police and security services, saying: **""The Government’s Orwellian plans for a vast database of our private communications are deeply worrying. I hope that this consultation is not just a sham exercise to soft-soap an unsuspecting public.”**""

* Despite being an environmentalist, ""In government, Huhne has maintained a flexible approach on the subject of nuclear energy advocating the three-pronged portfolio approach to energy: a commitment to nuclear energy; the development of more renewable energy, such as wind and sea power; and new carbon-capture technology to mitigate the damaging environmental effects of fossil fuel-fired power plants and industrial facilities.""

They do a very good job of explaining who the classic villains (like the Daleks, Cybermen, Silurians, and Sontarans) are when they show up. 

The benefit of having seen the classic series is that you'll catch more references and little in-jokes. For example, in s2 when they meet Queen Victoria and fight werewolves, the Doctor introduces himself as 'James McCrimmon' - Jamie McCrimmon was the companion of the second Doctor, and one of the longest-running ones on the series. 

So you can see all of the new series without getting lost, no problem, but familiarity with the old series just gives you some extra little nuggets of enjoyment.

true,SCFoximus,troughton,Troughton,"While I do agree on some points here, having watched about 95% of what's left of the classics (including some reconstructions), I agree with the majority. You really can't judge these incarnations of the Doctor off of just one serial. I definitely think you need to watch more of the classic episodes, particularly 2nd, 3rd, and 7th Doctor. 

While I too suggest skipping the latter three parts of ""An UnEarthly Child"" (it is immensely slow), I don't know if I agree about skipping ""The Daleks"". Yes, the seven episode serial runs at an almost dredging pace that is unlike anything we've seen in the new series, but it gives an interesting look at the Dalek's backstory (though 4th Doctor's ""Genesis"" is supremely better). I would however suggest that if you do end up skipping it, or if you're looking for a First Doctor story where he faces off against the Daleks, try ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"" instead. It's A LOT more exciting, has a great bit of character both for The Doctor (who is not just a grumpy old man) and his companions, and the serial has been referenced in the new series a few times.

Now, sadly there's not really much to go off of with 2nd Doctor, but I highly suggest watching ""Tomb of the Cybermen"" and ""The Invasion"" (which has had it's two missing episodes animated) as they are both pretty great stories, and to me are a much better representation of Troughton's take on the character than ""The War Games"". Yes, he's still a bit odd at times, but it's really more of an eccentricity, definitely similar to the Doctors of recent years.

And for the 3rd Doctor, while ""The Three Doctors"" is great (I love 2nd and 3rd reacting to one another), it doesn't really look at Pertwee's Doctor as much as it looks at the differences of the 2nd and 3rd incarnations. There's so much to suggest for seeing this character, but his first serial ""Spearhead from Space"" shows a pretty good start to Pertwee building the character, as does a lot of the stuff between him and the Master. And a must watch (at least for me) is ""The Time Warrior"" with the Doctor meeting with Sarah Jane and dealing with the Sontarans for the first time.

Fourth Doctor. I can pretty much suggest all of it. With the previous Doctor's, the longer serials occasionally seemed to drag in the middle, but with Tom Baker's stories even the six episode long serials stay entertaining through the middle for the most part. However, after Sarah Jane leaves there are quite a few companions each with their greatly detailed backstories that I could imagine would make it somewhat difficult to just jump into the middle of. Specifically in his last season, we see the departure of one companion and gain three in rapid succession almost immediately after, which all stay into to the Fifth Doctor serials.

Now, while ""Earthshock"" is one of the 5th Doctor's iconic episodes, I wouldn't say its a great jumping on point unless you're already invested in his companions. To me it seemed, from the start, Davison had an idea of what he wanted the Doctor to be like, and during his tenure he kept growing more and more into the role of that Doctor. Yes, he was the most human of the Doctors, but by the time ""Caves of Androzani"" aired, I think he had really made the Doctor his own. Unfortunately that was his last serial, but it was possibly his best.

Sixth Doctor, as you said, gets a lot of crap. But I think most of that is due to the 16-part ""Trial of a Time Lord"" which prevented Colin Baker from having the screen time to make his character grown in the way he wanted. I'll admit it, in his first serial ""The Twin Dilemma"", with the exception of the introduction of the new Doctor, I thought was pretty bad. Maybe one of the worst serials I'd seen. Left a bad taste in my mouth going into the 6th Doctor. But, even after that, I thought his full first season was great. Such a different take on the Doctor. Quit a bit darker, more akin to the action flicks of that time, not a bad thing whatsoever. And had that gotten to continue, or even just the character, I think less people would have thrown him under the bus.

""Remembrance of the Daleks"" is a great choice for the Seventh Doctor, but sadly that only shows a few sides of that character. Yes, the Doctor is more thoughtful, and secretive, and even at times manipulative, but given the stakes of ""Remembrance"" I wouldn't blame him for it when trying to save the Universe. True, he does act similar in other moments and serials, but not all are so extreme. Ace got on my nerves at first as well (wanted to smack her each time she called the Doctor ""Professor""), but in the end she really grew on me. Especially while watching 7th Doctor's last season, as it mostly had to do with Ace's backstory, which felt very similar to the way the current series is written.

And yes, the TV movie isn't the finest piece of Doctor Who lore. It suffers from trying to revitalize an old series for a new audience. But it is definitely far from the worst.",0,1328319387,null,0,false,0,c3npdpe,t3_p9vmy,t1_c3npdpe,t3_p9vmy,null,1428292796,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

true,ravniel,num11,,"This is a slightly more world-weary version of what I thought when I saw what we had and had not gotten.  I think (as Spooky does) that we're in the market for a world-class target man, we have candidates in mind, and none of them were available in January.  I think we're also looking for a promising winger to give Lennon some competition, and Hoilett wasn't for sale this window.  We'll also be in better negotiating position *after* we qualify for the Champions League.

So in essence I thought this window was used to shift out-of-favor players and bring in cheap cover.  The emphasis was clearly on loan rather than purchase, with the permanent targets largely unavailable or overpriced for January.  These were, in my opinion, pretty good objectives for a January window before Champions League qualification (with its attendant financial and prestige boost).  Saha and Nelsen will provide that cheap cover, and are under no illusions about the amount of playing time they'll get, which makes them an improvement over the players they replaced.  If we'd purchased, for instance, a stopgap 8m striker on a permanent deal (instead of a short-term deal), we'd then be faced with what to do with him when we *can* sign one of the top-class players we're looking at.  With Saha, that won't be a problem.

What I wrote wasn't (at all) supposed to be an attack on the classic series. Quite the contrary. What I wrote was supposed to be a primer for fans looking to foray into the classics based on the most popular episodes suggested for each Doctor. This was meant to tell people ""here's what people are generally going to tell you is the best example of each Doctor (because that's what they told ME) and here's what you have to expect. The first Doctor may turn you off. The second will seem more in line with what you're used to. The third may seem uninspired. The fourth really is as awesome as you've been told. The fifth might not be quite what you expect. The sixth isn't as horrible as everyone says. The seventh is a very intriguing character. And the eighth could've been okay if his one and only story hadn't been marred by terrible writing."" 

This was never supposed to warn people AWAY from the classics. It's supposed to say ""here's what you'll be told to watch from fans of the classic series and (unfortunately) these episodes may NOT be the best things to hook you."" The fact is, people ARE going to judge the Doctors based on their first experiences with them (which will likely be some of these episodes since I've seen and participated in numerous threads here recommending these exact episodes).

true,leondz,eu,Britain,"You raise some interesting points. I'm not familiar with the French system, but anything that encourages a service to be run as a business while also providing income-independent treatment is likely to promote a good healthcare system. The Scandi* system is more similar to ours, only with more expense and a little more waste, though gets similar results with much shorter recovery times and much higher patient approval - I think that's more of a hospital culture thing than anything else, though (max. 2 people per room, wards and corridors are kept very quiet, nurses smile and welcome visitors; it's convalescence-centric instead of value-centric, and feels correspondingly less stressed).

It's very important to get good value, otherwise systemic bloat sets in. We have that now.

Your most worrying point that the care system's structure will be led by GPs is indeed a cause for concern. British GPs are world leaders in delivering front line long-term basic diagnosis and care. Why dilute this specialty by asking them to speculatively allocate resources for a whole population based on their individual experiences? When will they do this?

Under the current setup, you should always be sent for a referral if you demand it - something that should *reduce* the chance of real problems being ignored by the GP, at the risk of a few mistaken referrals (false-positives). This is a very reasonable cost. The big few tasks of the GP, supported by personal feedback from a few friends in the job, is that they're there to soothe the population and to send serious things up the road. In effect, they deliver almost all of the healthcare in the country, and act as a filter to our specialists. This filtering could be seen as just dealing with ""I know precisely what this is"" cases, and sending everything else to a hospital (or other central location with a wide range of specialist knowledge and skills).

What the reform essentially does is bring back further diagnosis responsibility and authority to the GP; our GPs haven't been trained for this, don't have the skills for it - they're not meant to - and don't have the time for it. Our hospitals have all of these factors. Forcing complex responsibilities and decisions down to the front line places too much load on the GP, and that translates into risk and mistakes and lives. Ho hum.

On the other hand, your average BUPA night lackey has no idea how to read a chart, but all our NHS nurses have; bringing in private sector ""expertise"" certainly won't be nurse expertise, it'll be management ""streamlining"" expertise.

true,Porfeariah,tennant,Tennant,"It's more than just having an agent and fitting the requirement for a role the BBC is looking to cast in Doctor Who; there's also a the matter of being unionized to work on film &amp; TV.  I'm sure you've heard of SAG (Screen Actor's Guild) which is the name of the union in the US. In Canada it's ACTRA, in the UK it's Equity.  Unless you're looking to sit in the background of a scene as an extra (and sometimes even then, depending on how many extras are needed) you have to be a member of the union to work on major productions-- union rules.  Unless you're just *that* incredibly awesome, somehow get the attention of a someone responsible for casting actors on Doctor Who, and convince the show to take a hit in paying big fines for casting a non-union actor, you're not going to have much luck, my friend.  It takes years of hard work and paying your dues, literally and figuratively, to get to the point where you'll be considered for a speaking role on a big production.

THAT SAID... if you really, really want it, there's no time like the present to get started, right? Take some acting classes.  Make some connections.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Well, firstly, most of the stories on Netflix are normal episodes. In classic Who, one story is made up of many episodes, or 'parts'. Each episode is about 22 minutes long. Most stories are 4-6 parts long. So each story in classic Who is much longer than a new Who story.

And as for classic, First thing you do? Watch Genesis of the Daleks. then a quick rundown for the best stories of each Doctor:

William Hartnell, first- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore.

Patrick Troughton, second - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

Jon Pertwee, third- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

Tom Baker, fourth The most famous run. There are so many fantastic stories. Genesis of the Daleks, one of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic. And Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

Peter Davison, fifth -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special, andCaves of Androzani!* (the last story)

Colin Baker, sixth- His Doctor is unique with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good.

Sylvester McCoy, seventh. Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis. This is the era where they really try some crazy radical stories.

Plus there was someone on reddit who just tried looking at classic, one story per Doctor. Their views will show you that classic isn't perfect (obviously) and that people often felt that way at the beginning. I did, but now I adore classic. http://en.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/p9vmy/i_have_now_seen_every_doctor_in_action/

I bought a black light and I made ""Sonic Screw Drivers"" which is apparently a real drink, but I did vodka and orange juice, with tonic (which makes things glow in the black light, but you have to use more than really tastes good to make them really glow a lot) I also used food coloring and Made one yellow (rivers) One red (the masters) One Green (doctor 11) and one Blue (both 9 and 10). I also made double heart cupcakes, and my friends pitched in and bought me a Tardis cake (you can take in a glossy photo to most bakeries and they will print whatever you want on it.) I also served celery sticks. I made little Adipose with toothpicks and big and little marshmallow; painted little faces on them with chocolate. Do put a sign that says something about the toothpicks though so a drunk person doesn't coke on one. I also served phish sticks and custard, though not together... And I bought some 2 buck Chuck and made labels on them that said Napoleon's Private Stock... I purposely used really cheap wine so people could spit it out like the doctor did... I couldn't find them, but Jammie Dodgers and Jelly Babies are things that the doctor loves. I also had a costume competition which I found an ""emergency"" (like one of those break to open axe cases) bow tie to award for the best costume. There is a doctor who drinking game, I thought about getting a projector and projecting doctor who onto one of the walls in one room and posting the rules to the drinking game in that room... but I didn't get it together. I dunno... there are some fun ideas, I hope it helped, we had a lot of fun with the theme.

I assumed other people who were only familiar with the new series would start out with the same episodes I did and I wanted to give them my impressions of those episodes.

I'd hoped that maybe someone here might be able to give me (and others) advice on better episodes to watch to really get a sense for these Doctors. As for your specific complaints about my post:

- The first Doctor starts out that way. Fine. Unfortunately, most of the episodes suggested to me from his era are early episodes. And, honestly, from what I saw in The Three Doctors, he's still rude.

- What's a good third Doctor episode so I can get a better sense of who he is? Because I honestly thought he was bland in the episodes I saw and I'd really prefer to believe that none of the Doctors were ever boring.

- The movie has some shoddy writing. The ""half-human"" thing would probably confuse a lot of viewers since it isn't referenced before or after, to my knowledge. The Doctor does seem like a much more dynamic character here, which is vaguely reminiscent of the new series, but, unfortunately, he isn't given many good lines to show off his personality.

true,GrumpyHour,null,null,"The discussion does resurface, but my point is that it's all fairly contained within the weekly episode thread that gets pinned to the top of the subreddit. The remaining content on the rest of the front page now looks exactly the same regardless of whether the show is on or not, and it continues to become more and more outlandishly stupid. 

No TV show subreddit I subscribe to is as overrun with memes, merchandise pictures, and reposts in general as r/doctorwho is nowadays. The crime here is that it was once a community that was rife with intelligent discussion and original, provocative content that made it a fun place to meet and discuss with other Whovians. Now it's become an abomination in relation to what it used to be.

Those of us that have had to sit by and watch the quality of this subreddit plummet over the past several months have every right to complain about the fact that it's become overrun with garbage. Obviously, though, we're not in any position to tell people, ""Hey, we were here first. You guys should leave and give us our community back,"" but that doesn't mean we're not going to point out the fact that there's a serious lack of community standards and that as the subreddit has rapidly expanded, it's gotten continually more juvenile and disappointing to those of us who have seen its better days.

There's a reason you're not supposed to post advice animals and rage comics in r/funny; community standards dictated that those things, while there was certainly a demand for them, detracted from having a variety of unique and interesting content on the general subreddit, which is why there's now separate subreddits for those things for those that want to see them. 

The bulk of such content only began to sprout up around here on r/doctorwho long after this subreddit initially had a precedent of higher quality. Considering how huge this subreddit has become now, it absolutely isn't unreasonable to suggest that Who-related memes and ragecomics (and yes, even merchandise posts and other redundant material) should have separate communities to help keep the content of this one fresh and interesting for those who prefer it that way. Keeping the undesirable content mixed with the intelligent discussion alienates those that of us that don't want to see any of the former; with multiple subreddits, people can filter what they want to see and everyone wins.

Overall, though, you can't tell me that it gets better when the show comes back on, because last time that it did, the content only continued to deteriorate.

Gender re-assignment issues, for instance, are an area in which very few GPs have any experience - which is why that is all handled by specialist centralised mental health clinics (of which, afaik, there are only two or three in the whole of the UK).

Then there are those people who have had very specialised surgery, or completely customised artificial organs for whom their care is complex and important. GPs are spectacularly unprepared to deal with and understand these issues, which is why (once again) these are handled centrally or by London hospitals, regardless of where you are in the UK.

GPs are fine for common ailments, but the moment you have anything out of the ordinary, they are not good. It is already hard enough for these sorts of patients to deal with their GPs (in some cases they are already gatekeepers to these services, to the detriment of their patients - GPs have egos that must be assuaged at all costs, after all), to make them responsible in this way will further marginalise the most vulnerable or at risk.",0,1328343401,null,0,false,0,c3nsevi,t3_p97qh,t1_c3nsevi,t1_c3nl2gc,null,1428294211,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Sjreed,null,null,"O.K, I'll give my opinion on a fair amount of these replies. First point, does not negate the fact that people who have a vested interest are unlikely to agree with reform, like turkeys voting for Christmas. I don't disagree with the current pay for doctors, but I do beleive providers should be competeting for patients through service offered, something that does not happen at the moment.

Second point - ""profit is waste"" or it could be the price you pay to motivate better providers to come forward and bring in new solutions. If there is enough competition, profit margins must remain low and service high else patients will choose alternative options. To compare it to the railway privitisation is just wrong for many reasons, you can equally compare the current system to soviet supermarkets if you want to, both are stupid. The main differences being that a railway can increase its prices a health care provider can't as it's free/paid for by taxes, healthcare is massivley diverse and large parts of it do not have large barriers of entry (other than training) like setting up a competeting railway does.  

But a lack of profit incentive, accountability and lack of competetive forces can equally create waste, can you really imagine a private company spending 11billion on an I.T system they never use or the 115 million on consultancy fees in London alone last year.

For people that beleive that the current system is not suceptable to financial pressures and that every decision is made in accordance to the patients wellbeing need a reality check. Anything that is reliant on a budget will make decisions based on that budget, this includes the NHS.
Likewise as a potential patient I would much rather my care administered by a company set up and run by medical proffessionals who are not out for pure profiteering, but actually wanting to offer the best service and be rewarded for doing so. 
I'll illustrate my arguement with one story, but similar stories I'm sure could be seen in many other areas. A good friend of mine is a world leading child neuro psychologist. He worked at top hospitals in London and found the political atmosphere suffocating, the management poor and undirected and the majority of people in his position spent less than 1/3 of their time actually treating children with brain damage (which is what they are best qualified for).

Whilst there he started working self employed in the private sector and built enough business to leave to the NHS and create it into a small company taking on other child neuro-psychologists to do similar in very specific areas. The company now employs 50 people who all work remotley with the support of 5 top management/admin staff, all costs incurred are priced into an hourly rate which would undercut the equivelant NHS service massivley. The network of 50 people is dispersed throughout the country and can therefore provide to any location on a homevisit basis and their capacity is not nearly reached in what they can provide, meaning they could practically eliminate waiting lists. 

The benefits of this level of specialisation are also significant in terms of knowledge transfer, If you have the top 50 people in their area working specifically only in that area and sharing information and training with each other, it creates a learning culture that a large hospital with one or two specialists cannot foster.  

Currently if my son has a brain injury the NHS will not allow this company to provide the service which I require even though it's cheaper, quicker and the company I would beleive to do the best job. How is this the correct model? The fact is if profit motivation did not exist this company would not have formed and capable of offering an improved service at a lower price.

Firstly, a GP is not going to have the knowledge to be able to assess the stroke victim's communication. They may sometimes not refer in instances where they should have done. This is less likely to happen when the patient is assessed by a speech therapist straight away.

Secondly, it's an inefficiency. The patient is on the stroke ward with speech therapists (you may not be aware - and probably a lot of GPs aren't aware - but speech therapists deal with swallowing assessments i.e. whether the patient is going to choke on their food, so they are in every hospital). So the patient is with a bunch of speech therapists who can assess him there and then, but instead he has to go and make an appointment with the GP, who will refer him back to exactly the same speech therapists he was with on the ward. It's an un-neccessary delay in treatment and a waste of everyone's time.

Of course, this is just one example.

Very enlightened.

Why is it *not* criminal to call someone ""ginger"", ""fat"", or ""stupid""? Because these people don't go violent and sadistic about facts they can't change.

Why is it *not* criminal to call someone ""Bruce"", ""Aussie"", or ""Kiwi""? Because these people don't go violent and sadistic about facts they can't change.

Why, then, do people turn into wild primates then called something like ""black"" or ""Paki"" (it's short for Pakistani)? And why can we shorten the word ""Australian"" but not the word ""Nigerian""?

The truth is the British people pander to anybody that throws tantrums. The fact that certain racial groups throw the biggest tantrums just goes and proves how *racist* the British population is by giving privileges to some races and none to others.

I find the British *extremely* two faced. I don't see the British fighting for the rights of Australians and New Zealanders in the UK. In fact they openly tell them to ""go home"" and make racist jokes about them all the time.

Yes, they can, there's nothing stopping them. Why don't you post a thread discussing the episode? I don't see any posts discussing the show in your submissions list. You're just as guilty as those you're accusing of not discussing the show.

The thing is, people have far less interest in discussing old episodes, rather than speculating on new ones.

&gt;There's just as much garbage during the show's run as there is when it isn't going.

I never said the stuff you're not interested in isn't posted as much, why would it? People are just as interested in getting Who merchandise while the show is on, if not more interested in it.

What I said is there are a lot more threads discussing the show while the show is on. Please don't misrepresent my position, it shows dishonesty on your part, which discredits your argument.

On the topic of discussing old episodes, what is there to discuss (not arguing there's nothing, this is a genuine question), wouldn't discussion of classic who be more like a review of the episode? Not as interesting as speculation on the future of Doctor Who, and therefore less likely to be discussed.

American TV shows sometimes seem constrained, what with the language, but most of them can't really use all kinds of humor (religion, or racism (not that there is anything humourous there, just that it creates some weird atmosphere)). 

It might be because of national vs commercial vs cable networks. national have much more money, and more freedom, I guess, to do what they please. Most of big American networks are commercial networks which can't really do whatever they want because they depend on advertisers. that's where the limitations come from, because advertisers don't want to place ads in every kind of show. you can have a TV shows that has a lot of viewers, but portrays something bad, or not in views of advertising companies, and nobody wants to pay ads for that show. so you get TV shows where one character says something wrong and some companies refuse advertising and that show loses a lot of money. that may be why most American TV shows seem forced and have happy ending and not use bad language or explicit scenes. and then you have cable networks (or premium cable networks) who only make money from people paying for they channel (like HBO, AMC, Showtime and so on). because they don't depend on advertisers they can pretty much show whatever they want, kinda like national televisions. 

so I really think it's money and freedom to do what they want that make good TV shows. quality of TV shows on, for example, HBO and CBS is beyond comparison. on CBS you get procedurals, lots of episodes, just dragging TV show till it gets to syndication so they can make more money, while on HBo you get quality program, usually less episodes and TV shows that have story to tell, rather than just be broadcasted. so you can see how British TV and american cable televisions are kinda similar.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"If you end up watching the 1996 movie(Which I actually recommend, Paul McGann is fantastic in it!)there are a few things that you should keep in mind for your viewing pleasure.

1) The intro is a little off, and honestly doesn't make sense as-is. The books did a much better job explaining what happens, but the show kind of hand waves it off, and it really shows that they didn't care so much for the setup.  The setup to the movie is that The Master has been in cahoots with The Daleks for some unknown plan, but it's quickly figured out by the Daleks that he intends on betraying them. For this, he is exterminated. Before his death he reaches out to The Doctor through a psychic link, and requests that his remains be brought back to Gallifrey. Having been childhood friends with The Master, and not being able to deny such a last request, The Doctor abides.  This is roughly where the movie starts off, although the movie just gives a quick narration stating The Master had been put on trial by the Daleks for his evil deeds, and his last request was to have his remains taken back to Gallifrey.

2) This was meant as a very expensive TV pilot, but the series never got off the ground(Fox cancelled it).  As such, there are plenty of things in the movie that get brought up that are never resolved. This is because they were supposed to be resolved later in the new Doctor Who series.  I always liken this to saying imagine if all you had to go off of the new Doctor Who was the pilot episode Rose, and nothing else. There would probably be a lot of people that would say,""Wow, I'm glad *that* never got made it into a series."" Although I saw someone else explain it as only getting to see The End of Time, and I think that works just as well. I know there would be a lot of Whovians that would be rightly pissed about The End of Time if that was all they had to go off of.

3)With that said, people's biggest contention with this movie are two lines inferring that The Doctor is half human(on his mother's side). This has been argued and debated to death in the Doctor Who community. Like I said, it was a point that never got a proper resolution due to the series getting cancelled, and the IDW comic series probably covered it best in which it was a ploy by The Doctor using a chameleon arch to fool The Master into thinking he was half human.

4)Honestly, just have fun with the movie. It's good old fashioned Doctor Who cheesy fun. There are a ton of references to classic Who, and Paul McGann is **Amazing** as The Doctor. It gets very '90s' at times, but it's a 90s movie made with mostly American actors(It's set in America).  Will Sasso is probably the worst part about this movie, and he's thankfully only in it for a combined 15 minutes. Also, there are *way* worse episodes in new Doctor Who, and RTD has fucked with continuity way worse than some half human line.",0,1328364402,null,0,false,0,c3ntnl6,t3_pa7o1,t1_c3ntnl6,t3_pa7o1,null,1428294796,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Argentina's claims at the moment are mere claims for diplomatic negotiations, as requested by the UN to the UK, which the UK has ignored. Just like Israel does with Palestine and many other examples.
No one in Argentina is even remotely thinking of having an armed conflict of any kind, nor has it been even hinted by any politician of any political party.

By then, a desperate dictator we had invaded the islands, Margaret Thacher on your side didn't help much either.  By now, we have had a democratic government for over 30 years and, in my humble opinion, an armed conflict is as remote as you going back to war with Germany or France.

true,nonpareilpearl,tardis,TARDIS,"I understand that you seem frustrated, but I don't know if it warrants the all-caps response.

Look, you know as well as I do that most of the time when people discuss topics in depth it is NEW topics. Events in the current news, events that are currently happening in their class/home/social circle, etc. Sometimes, they even try to predict what will happen based on RECENT events. (e.g. ""Oh did you hear that country X did x?"" ""Oh dear, I hope country Y doesn't y as a response."")

I don't believe that it matters that the show has been on for fifty years for this reason. People who have been watching the whole time (or have watched as many episodes as they can find) probably don't have any new hypotheses about past events because they are past events and those storylines are completed. Since (for the most part) the further in the past the events in the series are the less likely to directly be involved in the current plots (excusing the fact that Doctor Who team likes to occasionally make references to previous Doctors/eras), they won't come up as often for this reason. I stand by what I said: you can only critique an episode that everyone has seen so many times when there is no new information to add to it. Even if you would like to see more discussion about past episodes, what will probably happen will be the same as what is currently happening: when NEW episodes come out discussions about mostly new and whatever old seems to apply will start to occur. Once the ""new"" is over, then that type of discussion will die down as people just discuss random topics until something new happens to add to the discussion. 

This isn't specific to Doctor Who. Maybe a good example would be to see how people think about past wars. Or for a more specific example: WWI. WWI was a big deal at the time and had long reaching effects, but how often do you see people actively discussing WWI? (Or even wars that were longer ago.) Not too often, I imagine, unless you are in a class or maybe a museum devoted to the topic. Even if you are: since WWI is past, they aren't really hashing new information as opposed to repeating the same information to a new audience.

true,andyrocks,cnty-scotland,Kingdom of Clapham,"&gt; Argentina's claims at the moment are mere claims for diplomatic negotiations, as requested by the UN to the UK, which the UK has ignored.

The UK rejects negotiations over *sovereignty*. That is off the table. Argentina cannot accept that.

&gt; Just like Israel does with Palestine and many other examples.

That's a very inflammatory example to pick. The situations are *nothing* alike.

&gt; No one in Argentina is even remotely thinking of having an armed conflict of any kind, nor has it been even hinted by any politician of any political party.

That's not the point - your country were the armed aggressors and invaders 30 years ago, and very rightly the defense of the Falklands is not neglected as it was in the past. Argentina has shown itself willing to use military force to seize the islands, and Britain is wary of that happening again.

&gt; In the UK, most of the press is talking about a 'threatening' situation and the UK has sent super duper war ships and the prince down there

Argentina seems to be the one causing this. Britain is responding in kind, but it was Argentina that arranged for FI ships to be blocked from entering South American ports.

I get the impression that however she went about it, you were going to disagree? That's not to say you're therefore wrong, of course, but that you think that she's full of herself and therefore dismiss-able (or maybe the other way around). Remember this is the *shadow* minister, so it's not like she has immediate clout.

&gt; The bar shouldn't need a shadow minister or any minister for equality to tell them what they should serve.

Yes, the *shadow* Minister for Women &amp; Equality made a complaint about the nature of the beer in the way it's advertised and presented. But of course she was not the one who banned it but rather:

&gt; Within 90 minutes, House authorities ordered the beer to be withdrawn after the leader of the Commons, Sir George Young, told MPs: ""Action will be taken.""

If it was harmless or not at all potentially problematic, then why would it have gone so quickly?

&gt; It isn't like everyone else has no sense of moral guidance and we all need anything that remotely plays to a specific sex to be pointed out to us.

A little bit of straw-manning there, as it isn't ""all or nothing"", nor was the shadow minister implying that only she is the guardian of morality. If there were no history of sexism (and we're talking about the establishment here, after all), then you might have a valid point. But, as I pointed out before: ""the description of the beer too reveals [the] connotations the beer maker were going for"". However, given the last part of your sentence, it perhaps does need pointing out as, whether it's intentional or otherwise, you've ignored the fact that this is advertising is pandering to a particular view of women that is rather ""1960's"" in nature.

As a i guess 'liberal/left' atheist I particularly despise that awful cultural relativism and capitulation where sections of the left join forces with islamists who are essentially fascists and should be the natural enemy of the left. 

Unite Against Fascism held a counter demonstration **alongside** members of Muslims Against Crusades (or whatever it was called back then, it is hard to keep track of all the banned iterations of it) against the One Law for All campaign. 

The One Law for All is a non-partisan human rights supporting anti-sharia law group founded to stop the influence of sharia and the idea it might ever be permitted in a secular legal system. They promote women's rights etc etc

If you dont know anything about Sharia, let's just say it's not nice and should be kept completely away from anything approaching legal status or even voluntary legitimisation .

So the UAF marched against the pro-human rights, pro-feminist, pro-secular campaign group and marched longside Muslims against Crusades who are Islamo-fascists, support the death penalty for gay people, the subjugation of women and theocracy and essentially want the world to be like Iran. UAF did this because they claimed One Law for All were racist. This ignores the fact there is no muslim race, it is a religion and the fact a large amount of the organisers and official spokespeople for One Law for All are ex-Muslims themselves. 

UAF are capitulators and scum of the highest order for this. Human rights are for all not for selected groups.

true,chrysics,null,null,"4-5-1 doesn't mean a whole lot. IMO Moyes's 4-5-1 is more attacking than his 4-4-2. First half, Pienaar and Donovan are both in attacking roles on the wings, and Cahill too in the centre. After Neville was brought on (I disagreed with that change too, ftr) we had Fellaini take over from Cahill, still really high up the pitch. 

After the switch to 4-4-2, Donovan and Pienaar didn't play as high up as before, and the two in the centre were less willing to get forward. That's not just this game, but every time we play 4-4-2. With two strikers you can't allow your wingers to play as high, you normally need your strikers deeper to avoid leaving too big a gap, and you need more discipline in the middle to counteract the loss of bodies in that area. 

If you think we're more effective in a 4-4-2, fine, you're entitled to your opinion. But I see this complaint so often, and it normally sounds like people think '4-5-1 = defensive; 4-4-2 = attacking', when it's nowhere near as simple as that. The roles of players in a formation can totally invert the naïve 'more strikers means more attacking' assumption, and I think it does in the case of the 4-5-1 (arguably a 4-2-3-1, or at the least a 4-4-1-1) and 4-4-2 interpretations Moyes tends to go for.

That being said, having watched close to everything (and that it's been over two years since I last saw those episodes), I might have to re-watch the rest of that serial, since I am now well aware of the pacing of the classic series, as to give it a better comparison to the rest of the series.",0,1328399426,null,0,false,0,c3nycyk,t3_p9vmy,t1_c3nycyk,t1_c3nsxpk,null,1428297079,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Politics is a popularity contest. It's safer to say 'Oh yes, that's wrong etc etc' than it is to say 'I think it's harmless and just a bit of a joke' because you risk being branded by a few as a certain label, the media love to jump on this kind of thing.

I guess I'd draw attention to the expenses scandal. When it was all made public, suddenly all the MPs wanted it changed and stated it was morally wrong. As long as it isn't known or has attention brought to it, then I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people (MPs) didn't give two shits.

Call me cynical, but it's a bit of circle jerk.

2. Draw public attention to it.
3. Complain.
4. Now everyone thinks you're a champion of some righteous cause, but really you're making a fuss out of something very small and wasting a lot of time just to gain brownie points.

Personally I don't see a massive campaign over this and I haven't seen Kate Green giving press conferences. In fact I've not see it reported anywhere but here, though I'm off to have a look now... There doesn't seem to be much around at all. The BBC don't appear to have reported it. I found this [though](http://www.messengernewspapers.co.uk/news/community_news/9511553.MP_complains_about_Top_Totty_beer/).

&gt; Ms Green said during business questions last Thursday: “Will the Leader of the House arrange a debate on dignity at work in Parliament? Last night I was disturbed to learn that the guest beer in the Strangers Bar is called Top Totty, and that there is a picture of a nearly naked woman on the tap. As well as arranging a debate, will the Leader of the House join me in asking for that beer to be withdrawn from the bar immediately?”

It seems she used it as an example to bring about a debate about dignity in work, though it's possible it was what got her thinking about it in the first place. So she didn't draw public attention to it as such, at least she could have done it in a *much* more public way i.e. gone straight to the press. If she really had an agenda then it's possible she would have done that.

&gt;  but really you're making a fuss out of something very small and wasting a lot of time just to gain brownie points.

Again, it's not like this isn't a wider issue in society in general and I don't think it's fair to dismiss her entirely.

First game was beating Ipswich 4-1 at home in 1994 I think. Rideout and Ferguson got 2 apiece. Barely remember it, the first one I remember is beating QPR away, when Andy Hinchcliffe scored a cracking last minute free kick. That must have been right before the 1995 FA Cup Final.

My favorite player as a kid was Andrei Kanchelskis. Nowadays, I'll sing Leon Osman's praises to anyone that will listen (nobody) and my Everton jersey has Coleman on the back. Last summer I actually went to the DC United pre-season friendly, and got to meet Tim Howard and Tim Cahill, both of whom were top blokes. And, for added measure, my favorite game that I attended was beating Villa 2-1, when Rooney scored a last-minute volley. Magnificent.

true,Zylowen,tennant,Tennant,"Well, after (purely coincidentally) re-watching ""The Beast Below"" today, I found myself reflecting on the concept of a society in which everyone chooses to ignore or willingly forget what they know to be true about the way their society operates.  I think this general thematic element applies to many of the patients in Cuckoo's Nest, particularly the ones who remain on the ward voluntarily.  

As phantompunch pointed out, there's the obvious issue of lobotomizing or reaching the desired alterations in a person or creature by ""treating"" them with electric shock/hooking them up to machines.  And I think there could be some comparison/contrast between McMurphy and Liz 10.  We could also have a successful discussion about how Liz 10 does or does not compare with Nurse Ratched.  After all, both at least claim to be well-meaning and effectively enforce orders to torture or maim the story's savior. 

Amy Pond points out the obvious parallels between The Doctor and the star whale for us, but I think that could lead to a fruitful discussion about how McMurphy also shares characteristics with both the Doctor and the star whale.  Although McMurphy is committed to the ward, he has essentially volunteered to be the champion for the other patients.  And even after all that Nurse Ratched puts him through in terms of punishment, he remains kind and willing to sacrifice for his fellow patients.  

Both the novel and the episode are also rather critical of democracy, and I think that looking at that criticism in the context of something like DW to compare and contrast with the message in the novel might provide students' with a different lens through which to view the issue, perhaps spark some further analysis. 

There are several other ways I think the conversation could be spun in the classroom to inspire the students to think critically and analyze both the novel and the episode effectively, and their critical thinking skills and literary analysis are a major focus of this semester.  It's something with which the junior students have been struggling, so part of my challenge during student teaching is to help redirect them.  I'd like to do that in a way that is both effective and enjoyable. ",0,1328417526,null,0,false,0,c3o0wzx,t3_pb3ho,t1_c3o0wzx,t3_pb3ho,null,1428298284,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Truth is, the ""twelve regenerations"" was just a thing mentioned in some episodes a long time ago, before the reboot even. I've heard people say it was because they had ""planned it all along"", that the doctor was to become the valeyard in some awful conspiracy written by doctor who headwriters.

Stop being so naïve. Truth is, people didn't think the show would work that well, and at the time, 12 seemed far enough in the future for them not to have to worry about it. What's going to happen, and has happened already, is that they'll retcon it and move on. The doctor already said he could regenerate how many times he well pleases. An inconsistency ? In Doctor Who ? Boo fucking hoo.

Don't get me wrong, I love Doctor Who. My only poster is a WW2 dalek propaganda, I own a bow tie and a tweed, etc. But seriously, the show has the worst continuity in the gorram 'verse. You'll find thousands of contradictory statements (I'll give you one : the Doctor has taken companions to Gallifrey and the TARDIS translated gallifreyan. When Amy looks at River's cob she can't read the writing ""because it doesn't translate gallifreyan). Instead of finding a proper answer, Moffat, the master of ""I don't give a shit, I don't want to write a good ending so let's say it was a robot the entire time even though it was impossible for him to fake regeneration"", did yet another one of his ""you shouldn't have accepted me as head writer"" tricks by introducing ""the doctor lies"". By that sole statement, I can make him say whatever the fuck I please, doesn't matter, because the doctor lies.

What I'm expecting is some fucked-up explanation as to why the doctor regenerated more than 12 times to show up on the internet somewhere, Moffat-approved. Just like the parsec Star Wars Millenium Falcon shit.

Think that's a rant ? That is a rant. I'm tired of one of my favorite series having such awful continuity, just because no one can be bother checking back, or not fucking with things they can't back up with previous facts. And I'm tired of people going ""Doctor Who makes so much sense, so clever ! Hahahahaha !""

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; The implication of the highlighted part being that the political class, i.e. the land (property) owning class, were not completely aware of what they were doing. Which, to me, seems utterly naïve.

I'm inlined to disagree.

I don't think anyone objects to green-belt building (in general, as opposed to NIMBY) on the basis of protecting their own property values. That's something that's happening in the next town (or at least, on the other side of town), and when planning applications are going through it won't affect the value of your own home for years. In fact, the town's growth may cause the value of existing properties to rise.

When people are egregiously selfish, they don't tend to think so long-term or at such a remove. In fact, on a small scale, any member of the ""landed classes"" would be glad to have their agricultural fields suddenly worth 10x as much if the area was rezoned for development.

I'm pretty sure green-belt is widely, in the public consciousness, including amongst the Tory-voting richest few percent, about preserving a green and pleasant England. It may be selfish of those whose mortgages are paid off, whose property values have risen massively, to say ""I've got mine, Jack"", but I really don't think they're very aware of this connection - it's not their motivation. And, as a tenant myself, I do kinda think it'd be a shame were our countryside to suffer, should the government attempt to preserve property prices whilst addressing the shortage.

IMO the biggest contributor to the current property prices problem was Thatcher's sell-off of the council houses. That started 30 years ago, and on a project of this scale (at one time in the 70s *one third* of the population lived in council homes), yeah, 20 - 30 years is the kind of period in which you start to see the real and long-term ramifications. There are plenty of people still alive who, after some years of renting, bought their council houses for £6000 or so and reaped immediate profits many times that. 

When I was growing up, all kinds of people lived in council houses - nurses, office clerks and factory workers, anyone and everyone could get one. Council houses filled a *very significant* proportion of the role now filled buy buy-to-let landlords, but they were offered at fair or subsidised prices, and there was no profit motive.

Our stock of council homes was a *massive* national and public resource which generated short-term profit, political and actual, that they Tories had no right to plunder, but they were not at the time *conscious* of the ramifications we see now - it was purely a political decision, Thatcher's belief that the government should not be in the house-building business, ""competing"" with Barrett's and Wimpey Homes.

true,smardalek,dalek,Dalek,"In my opinion, the ""direction"" the reddit is taking is a completely normal one. It's a pattern that many people have already noticed.

Off-season generates little new solid content--rather, it's fluff to pass the time and fill up a reddit that might otherwise die without it's awesome community. 

I saw this happen in another popular reddit because people couldn't come to a consensus on what they wanted to see...and since everyone was scared of being shunned for posting something against the unspoken rules, the reddit stagnated in the weeks when there were no new episodes or news of actors to bring up.

The on-season, however, yields both--the fillery fun stuff, and the meatier discussion/theory/epileptic trees sort of stuff. The reddit is more active because people have a new source to draw from, and because people will want to be in on the action and novelty of the fresh new sci-fli glory being fed to their eyes :&gt;

But then when a season is over, it trickles off, some people drift away from the reddit to return when the content *they* personally enjoy also returns. The posts then turn again to what I called earlier 'the fluff'. The fluff is not a bad thing, in any case. At least there's shiny new blue links on the front page for you every day ;)

He's also coming out with an 11th Doctor's sonic, also modeled directly from Robatto's prop, except that it will hold up to the wear and tear that one puts on such a prop.

Such as what if thousands of years ago Aliens landed on Earth and conquered us all and through psychic thought changed our entire memory of our (human) past making us think they never landed but in fact mated with us slowly becoming more human then alien.

This is no invasion....we have already been invaded, this is a revolution! Ahhhhhhh!!

Also i had another fun paradox idea. That humans do eventually create time travel but get it wrong somehow and when they land on Earth it is in the period where we find the first caveman bones because in fact...we are those cavemen! We created our own history and future! Ahhhhhh! They only began looking ""ape-like"" because that is actually our future evolution adapting to Future Earth atmosphere.

true,Kim147,uk,British Sandgroper,"Nobility and wealth are often not related . British rich families suffer from exactly the same problem of other rich families - the first generation makes the money , the second generation spends the money , the third generation loses the money .

Nobility is a sense of values , an approach to life . The peerage has a lot of very down to earth people . Generally speaking you are much more likely to find snobs out of the peerage - eg. in the lower middle class - than in the peerage .

Peers do work and they work very hard . Some of them work in their family businesses , some do charity type work , or often a combination of both . Some go into politics and the diplomatic services , the army and the public services. 

Landed Gentry have the estates to manage - these can often be very time consuming . These estates will only have a few staff and almost all of them will be working on the farm . 

Estates often have a lot of farming related businesses and non farming businesses . These include fishing , game shooting - pheasants etc. , B&amp;B accommodation , forests - farming and walking etc. .

Peers often don't employ much in the way of domestic staff . In days gone by the domestic staff were employed largely to spread the wealth around and to provide local employment and training . It was part of how the welfare state operated at that time . Those with money were very conscious that they had the responsibility to spread it around and to do so wisely and productively .

Downton Abbey , like a lot in TV land , is largely imagination rather than reality - it's entertainment and artistic license rather than accurate documentary .

For those who are suggesting 'stop them trading in cash' - erm, no, just make sure things are properly tracked.  Cash trade is vital to these companies; people who are determined to steal and do illegal things will do it regardless; it's better to simply arrest and remove those companies accepting stolen goods.  

Imagine if we stopped 'cash trade' for shopkeepers since we were worried they were selling cigs and booze to underage kids, so you had to have debit\credit card - small shops would go under.

Private insurance is available for higher income earners . The system works very well .

GP's set themselves up in surgeries - usually with fellow GP's , nurses and admin. staff . A typical surgery will have 4 to 6 GP's , 1 to 2 nurses , 1 to 2 admin. staff .

Hospitals are owned by GP co-operatives , church groups etc. - St. John of Gods , private companies , shire councils and the state government .

Surgeons operate privately and can operate in multiple hospitals .

Medical services - eg. pathology - is largely privately supplied .

What it means is that the patient has full choice . The GP's and surgeons also have far more freedom , and , of course , responsibility and control to go with that freedom .

As a patient you can walk into any surgery and get treatment with very minimal paperwork - it's far easier than it is in the UK .

I will grant you that plain snobbishness is more of a middle class attribute though, and I quite agree about the amount of work that most of them seem to do, however.

With regards to the employment of domestic and estate staff, though, I am not at all convinced that this was quite good natured charitability that you suggest. In the days before mechanisation and mass-production, before artificial fibres and agro-chemicals and so on, maintenance of house and wider estate required an enormous amount of ongoing labour whilst the costs in the form of wages were relatively very much cheaper than today, so far more staff were needed, and could be afforded.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;IMO the biggest contributor to the current property prices problem was Thatcher's sell-off of the council houses. 

This is only a tiny piece of the problem, even if all those houses were still council owned house prices would still have risen massively and would still be expensive simply because there's significantly more people living in the UK now than in the 1980's (as well as an increased tendency for one parent families etc.).

It wasn't really the selling council homes off, it was *not building any more*.  I actually doubt they even expected the private sector to pick up the slack simply because they've done *nothing* to encourage it, it seems to me everyone, be it consciously or subconsciously, knew they were going to be better off if nothing happened.

*Inaction* is just as much an act towards the solution to our housing problems, which is really just a case of needing *more* homes one way or another.

&gt;I don't think anyone objects to green-belt building (in general, as opposed to NIMBY) on the basis of protecting their own property values. 

I know I didn't make my post at all clear or detailed, because I was mostly just putting a quick thought into a post, but when I'm talking about property I mean in the true sense of the word, not just homes, and when I said 'aware of what they were doing' I didn't mean it in some conspiracy kinda way.

So for example coal, oil and gas companies are property owners; music, film, TV, game companies are 'property' owners; et cetera.

The majority of property owners are either *directly* involved in the political process or at the very least informed and knowledgeable enough (even if it is intuition) to understand the consequences of, say, not building more homes, preventing green builds, IP/Copyright lockdown et cetera.

The actions (or, in fact, their *inaction* in many cases) by this group, collectively, in their votes, monetary choices and protests have shown government that they do not care about this problem; they don't care about this problem because they are better off because of it.",0,1328437324,null,0,false,0,c3o2zdq,t3_pahxe,t1_c3o2zdq,t1_c3o1vco,null,1428299258,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Secondly money does not grow on trees . Money is a representation of hours worked - it is an exchange of hours worked . People who are working at the level of producing commodities will always be paid a basic wage . If the wage is increased this does not increase their buying power - it only produces inflation . The only way that their buying power can be increased is by - i) increasing the level of technology attached to their work process , and ii) correspondingly increasing their skill level - ie. produce plane wings rather than be a medieval farmer .

Thirdly Britain has traditionally had a meritocracy and had good social mobility . I know things have changed a lot in these respects during the last government . The way things were done in the past was very much a product of the times . Although full universal suffrage may not have existed it did operate very much in practice . If , for example , the King wanted to raise an army he asked his Barons , Dukes , Lords , whether they would support the raising of an army . They , in turn , would ask those under them . This would end up at the squires who would ask the locals . It was only with the direct support of these locals that the King could raise the army . Our modern communications , of course , make the world of a difference .

Now I'm not saying all the Lords and Ladies are perfect , far from it . However there is good in all stratas of society . The are good and not so good workers and there are good and not so good peerage . However the measure of a nation is the amount of good and the amount of community .

I sympathise with the dead of the first and second world wars - they were after all forced into it. But war memorials don't benefit them, being dead. Their families I suppose might take some solace in seeing a name they recognise on a piece of metal, but given that it's close to 100 years since WWI I doubt many people remain that knew the victims. The reason the Daily Mail is so interested in this I suspect relates to their slavish devotion to the myth of Britain's honourable parochial past (not that they did much to contribute (Hurrah for the Blackshirts!)). And of course the perpetrators more often than not seem to be non-white, something I'm sure the DM has noticed. Personally, I'd rather see a war memorial stolen or vandalised than for instance the roof of a building used by a community like a school or youth centre, which not only more severely affects people alive today, but costs more than simply replacement when weather and environmental damage is taken into account. This dead-as-sacred-cows malarchy only obfuscates the fact that the theft of a manhole cover or railway cabling poses a much more real threat than that of a war memorial.

&gt; Here's how I see it; the regeneration limit is biological. A Time Lord can, however, obtain more regenerations thrugh two means; they can either be given regenerations by a fellow Time Lord, who in turn loses regenerations. Or, the Time Lord government can bestow regenerations when needed, either as a reward, or because there's a war going on and they need as many Time Lords surviving as possible. During the Time War, the Doctor was given either 510 or 511 extra regenerations, depending on whether the regeneration used to create the Meta-Crisis Doctor counts as a full one. River Song also gave her 10 (or possibly less) remaining regenerations to the Doctor during Let's Kill Hitler, which gives the Doctor around 520 remaining regenerations.

Yes, this is exactly what I was  getting at - technology has allowed us to produce goods, materials and some services - far more efficiently and quickly, whilst labour has broadly the same value per hour or day meaning that 1 farmworker with a tractor and a chainsaw, or 1 domestic servant with a dishwasher and vacuum cleaner, can do the work that several would have done - with far less expense. Equally, labour in the form of maintenance of many items is relatively more expensive than simply replacing the item with a new, mass produced, one: labour is, as a result, relatively more costly nowadays, and was relatively cheaper before this.

There are no signs backing up this edict. No notices were posted, no letters were sent. It's *just* the word of an American camera that people have now elevated to the position of emissary of Camden Council.

Seeing as we're speculating on Camden's motives let me get in on the act. I've been to Camden, I've been on the estates like this one. There will be mixed groups of kids, white, black, Somali, Asian, who will crowd in an area like this.

Again, there are two options. They did it on purpose, or they did it by accident. The lack of signs and or notices/letters backing up these new ""rules"" leans me towards the accidental option.

As to the audio adventures not being canon, stuff from the audios has been mentioned in the new series so they're as valid as any of the books or the old series.

Also, it's a show about time travel where the past can and does change, so there's no such thing as a ""continuity error""

Basically people just pick the bits they like and ignore the ones they don't like or don't know about. If you haven't listened to the audios, then they're ""not canon"" for you and that's grand.

People upvote/downvote on issues based on opinion and allegiance rather than the substance of someone's point (even if, and especially if, that point is one that they disagree with).

true,ghostridethewhip,null,null,"Man, what to say.

1) Cahill looked fantastic. There is definitely something to the idea that Terry/Luiz are too similar to play together. Cahill accompanied Luiz very well today, with the one glaring mistake (the Chicarito equalizer) coming from Luiz losing his marker.

2) Fantastic game from both goalkeepers, considering that 6 goals were scored. Cech looked lively all day, and De Gea made up for a poor first half with that Mata save. Possibly the save of the season. I still have no idea how he did that.

3) First penalty was legit (Sturridge's), second was horrid (Ivanovic's). Iva just stood there and Welbeck did some major foot dragging to even make any contact. A dive if I've ever seen one.

4) Essien absolutely bossed the midfield through the first 75-80 minutes. If there were any worries about having midfield chutzpah with Ramires out, Essien answered that call today.

5) Bosingwa actually played pretty well at LB. Valencia was pretty much anonymous today, and that is saying something considering his form. Maybe we should keep Bosingwa there, as he is a terrible RB 90% of the time. That was a joke, we should sell him, but he played well.

6) People are giving Malouda too much stick. He played really, really poorly last match, but he had a solid game today, especially considering that he had no link up play since Bosingwa was a fish out of water in the attack on the left.

Lots of positives to take out of this encounter. Any time a three goal advantage is given up, it sucks, but two of them were penalties, one was very questionable, and barring a bad call and a world-class save, we would have beaten Man U 4-2.

I agree on Malouda. He was better today but still offers us next to nothing. He kept trying to counter when we had the 3-0 lead and was relly poor in possesion all game. Hes not doing his defensive duties either. We cant get him out of the team soon enough.

I initially though Luiz was at fault for the third goal but he was marking a delayed run from welbeck. Our backline and our gk need to have better communication.
 I think Luiz Cech and Cahill were all equally at fault.

Our shortage of midfielders really showed today. They got fatigued pretty early. We coulda used Ramires today.

Considering we have at least one more year with Matt Smith (though I'm hoping for at least two), the upcoming season will run into 2013. If that is where Smith's run ends, we will then have two more Doctors. If these two new actors each do a three year run (give or take), that would make the show last until 2019, with the new series having been on air for about 15 years. 

Yes, that is only just over half the time the original series ran, but really all good things must come to an end. And you can't tell me you're not interested to see how the Doctor's story ends.

And I'd say if they really wanted to keep the show going after that, they could maybe let Paul McGann take the reigns for a DW: Time War series.

If anyone can get him back on track I think it'll be AVB but the fact of the matter is we need a confident striker who can shred through defenses and smash the ball into the back of the net - with confidence and with consistency. We all know he can do it, but he just *has to*.

Yeah he froze up today and the sad thing is that most of his great performances are punctuated by something like that.

 After drilling for two decades through more than two miles of antarctic ice, Russian scientists are on the verge of entering a vast, dark lake that hasn&amp;#039;t been touched by light for more than 20&amp;thinsp;million years.

 To prevent a sudden release of gas, the Russian team will not push the drill far into the lake but just deep enough for a limited amount of water - or the slushy ice on the lake&amp;#039;s surface - to flow up the borehole, where it will then freeze.

 Priscu said Russian scientists on the scene e-mailed him last week to say they had stopped drilling about 40 feet from the expected waterline to measure the pressure levels deep below.

&gt; I had heard that if they had stayed within the promised boundaries (set out in the Maastricht treaty I think) there wouldn't have been the crisis.

That might be true, but the structure of the euro meant that was never going to happen.  Because of a an artificially low interest rate in the med countries, there were always going to be massive loan inflows to those countries, generating economic booms.

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"Same here my friend, same here.

Dickens isn't that great of a writer (hold the pitchfork Dickens fans.) He was paid by the page for many of his works (some people back then liked to squeeze all the talent out of a writer they could, and thought that more pages = more words, and more words = more of the authors talent) We, of course, now know that it is not quantity, but quality, which really makes a great author. Ernest Hemmingway is probably one of the most ecological authors to have ever been, and although both him and Dickens created great works, Ernest Hemmingway is seen as the superior writer because of his fantastic prose, which is void of fluff and unnessecary language. I read Nicholas Nickleby by Dickens, the first 3 or so pages are a back history of the main character which basically reads like this:

* Two brothers owned a farm and were pretty different from one another.

* They each had 2 sons, who were also different from one another.

* These sons has more kids.

* These kids had even more kids.

* These kids had even more kids and one of these kids was Nicholas Nickleby.

That's the gist of it anyway.

I am a pretty massive reader, and if someone were to ask me for my opinion on reading in regards to children, and how to get them to read more, i would offer this as a solution:

Limit the amount of time a kid can do things like watch TV or play of the PS3. It seems obvious but reading helps children learn to focus. It's very difficult for people to sit down in a chair for two hours without any distractions and read, but this is how i do it. It's a process that is learned, and i think having a dedicated time for reading each night/week/whatever will help the child get into a sense of routine and help them learn how to make the outside world evaporate so they can focus on the task at hand.

I understand that not everyone likes to read like I do, and that some people prefer reading on transport, with music on, with the TV on in the background etc. And that's fine, i just think it's important to stop the child being distracted by these things at first, by removing them. Then, if they decide they like reading, it's okay to introduce those things into the background if it helps them. I know this comes across as maybe cynical towards children, like they're just unable to enjoy a book and would prefer more easily digestible and consumable entertainment like TV or video games, but in my experience this has been largely true.

Secondly, get them reading things which are challenging. Not only on a reading level, but on a level which will challenge their ideas of what they like. Introduce them to new genres and styles. They liked Harry Potter? Good, how about we swap wizards for vampires and get them The saga of Darren Shan. It's a 12 book series about a guy who becomes a vampire by accident, has to leave his life behind, joins a travelling freak show (with real freaks,) and leads the war of the vampires vs. the vampaneze. Doesn't sound like their cup of tea? How about a werewolf series? The Demonata series, also by Darren Shan, which is set in a world where demons exist just beyond out reality, but can cross into our world and kill hundreds of people in a few seconds. It also gives assive amounts of time to the game of chess, and it's probably the most important thing in the whole story..

These series were fucking bad ass, but is looked over by many parents because it's not as 'kid-friendly' as something like Harry Potter. They're both 'horror' series, and deal with things like death and destruction on a much bigger scale that Harry Potter does, but they're written in such an easy to read and enjoyable way that your kid won't be able to put them down.

Thirdly, I'd try and make reading a real part of their lives, and not just a thing that they would be doing for school. I think that if your child shows an interest for reading, the best way to nurture that interest would be limiting the availability of other forms of entertainment like TV, PS3, or the DS etc, which, although maybe not the first choice, are in many way more addictive and more pleasurable to use because they give you a 'quick-fix' of entertainment, whereas reading a book is a 6-10 hour investment of your time usually. (Talking about standard novels here)

I think writers like Adams or Pratchett aren't that marketable to 10-11 year olds, and maybe their audience lies with the slightly older teenagers (13-14) and of course, adults. They're both great writers, but i think there are a few book series which would be a good lead-up to reading books by Adams and Pratchett (and from there onwards and upwards to the dreaded Dickens)
 
And to address your last point:

&gt;Why am I an inferior specimen for preferring these great authors to Dickens?

You're not. Dickens is detestable in many aspects, but there's a myth of Dickens that surrounds his work which means that he's held in a high regard when there are many writers who surpass him. He's just a part of the collective national consciousness, and his importance and greatness is drilled into our heads from an early age, when i think he isn't as deserving of it as many other authors are.

**ALSO.**

**If there are any parents here who are interested in the book series i mentioned, shoot me a PM, i might have something you'd be very interested in. The books are aimed at (imo) 11-16 year olds, but i'd do some research into the books to see if your kid would like them.**",0,1328475979,null,0,true,0,c3o77x9,t3_pc23h,t1_c3o77x9,t1_c3o5u5z,null,1428301326,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"I'm not saying RTD's era was bad, necessarily, but my big problem was with RTD himself. I'm usually not one to pay attention to writers for TV shows, but going back I realized a lot of the episodes that I generally wasn't fond of(aside from the obviously bad episodes) were RTD written episodes. Such as the clusterfuck that was Journey's End, and I admit, I would probably pick The End of Time over Journey's End. Although that's not to say that I don't have qualms with The End of Time.

And I'll even admit a bit of bias in my direction. Mostly in hindsight. There have been things that RTD did to continuity/general storytelling that really rubbed me the wrong way/set off my nerd rage, and it only made things worse when I started comparing them to the 'complaints' people have of the 1996 movie, which as I said, was my first outing into the world of Doctor Who. People complained that The Doctor kissed a human in the movie, but with RTD he's constantly pining over Rose, and vice versa. In the movie there literally was no romance, it was more of a,""Hey, I'm gonna kiss you! That's what humans do, right?"" Which I find much more acceptable of The Doctor.  Then there was the whole Master debacle, but RTD basically turned The Master into a manic depressive Sith Lord.

At the end of the day, though, it's still Doctor Who, I still enjoy it, I still watch it, but it doesn't quite fill me with the same joy and excitement that I get from both the classic series as well as Eleven's run so far.

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"1. Cahill was super today (in my book) considering the pressure, the expectations and all that. There was one dodgy moment but I am not sure of Welbexk exaggerated it. Seemed to me, Cahill tackled him outside the box (dodgy, kinda) and then rolled as he slid, tripping Welbeck in the process. Not sure if that's a pen, but maybe an FK on the edge? Webb kinda lost control of his senses after that... 

2. Cech was the better keeper although Utd didn't have much to trouble home with. Their shots (when they did) were pretty much on target. The reason I say he was better is because he was handling the weakest defense we've had in ages. A new guy, a young 'geezer', a useless LB and a solid RB who was doubling up as a CB. Having said that, De Gea pulled two magnificent saves that my jaw is still recovering from. 

3. Sturridge penalty was an accident waiting to happen. Brana putting in double shift, Bos lost elsewhere, Malouda drifting around, Webb playing in the hole behind Rooney &amp; Welbeck - you get the idea. Having said that, Evra went down a little too easily, IMO. YMMV. The second was a disgrace. Webb really needs to retire from the game. 

4. Essien was robust for about 60 min - good enough for me. I also think AVB should have subbed him for Romeu - like for like. Romeu spent most of the time running around like a headless chicken after he came on. Again, YMMV. 

5. I didn't see Malouda on the pitch at all! It was either Essien or Mata coming in deep or Luiz bombing forward. Malouda was kinda anonymous. His stats apparently tell a different story, it seems. Maybe I confused Essien with Malouda? Whatever it was, the midfield service was horribly lacking.

6. NO. Bos was piss-poor at LB; his saving grace was that Rafael &amp; Valencia were poorer. I still think Bert should have gotten a start or at least a sub - maybe he'd have owned both of them, who knows? I honestly feel that a right-footed LB is a bad idea - it restricts your movement immensely. But, YMMV. I'd genuinely like to hear opinions on this one.

7. Webb should not be allowed near a football pitch for the rest of his life. Torres' yellow, Brana yellow, Rooney -escaping a yellow for dissent, Scholes escaping a card for a two-footed studs-up lunge - these are the ones I can think of. I'm not counting the PKs since they are the obvious ones. How does the FA not take note of this and jumps immediately on (relative) inanities such as the English captaincy? IMHO, this is more dangerous to the spirit of the game than anything else. We've dropped a few points that might have helped team-morale and made the transition a tad bit 'smoother'...

true,[deleted],null,null,"I oppose these changes strenuously, but here is my best stab at a positive case for them.

The NHS is not monolithic. To simplify: there are two kinds of NHS body, called NHS trusts. There are primary care trusts, which run GPs, and acute care trusts, which run hospitals. So in Oxford for example, there is Oxford Primary Care trust, which runs GP surgeries, and Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals Trust, which runs the hospitals.

Primary care trusts are broken up by region, like counties, and are responsible for (1) paying GPs to have patients, and (2) buying secondary care, like hospital care, from acute care NHS trusts. They spend most of the NHSs money in this way: they are given the money by the govt, and they spend it on acute care trusts. This is the 'internal market' introduced by the Tories and refined by Labour. In the old days, there was none of this money-shuffling.

It's quite a neat setup: each Primary Care Trust (PCT) is like an insurance company for that region. But they can (more or less) only buy care from other NHS trusts. Each PCT makes different choices about what to buy, leading to a 'postcode lottery'. But the core treatments are mandated from the centre: PCTs couldn't decide not to pay for broken leg surgery, for example.

The reform will do 3 things: (1) remove primary care trusts, and replace them with groups of GPs; (2) make NHS acute trusts more independent than they already are, into 'foundation trusts', which are more financially independent; (3) allow PCTs to buy care not just from NHS trusts, but from charities and private companies.

The rationale is: 
1. why have an extra layer of bureaucracy? instead of giving money to PCTs and PCTs managing GPs and buying care, why not just give money straight to groups of GPs?

3: why not let private companies provide care? they might be better and cheaper than nhs acute trusts, and even if they're not the competition should drive up quality all around. why *not* allow additional bodies to provide care? what's wrong with extra choice?",0,1328483602,null,0,false,0,c3o8gmi,t3_pbmx8,t1_c3o8gmi,t1_c3o79za,null,1428301910,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Someone suggested Torres on the wing and Studge up top. Worth a try, However, having watched him today, I feel Torres needs two things: service and distraction - service from a good, willing midfielder &amp;  distraction from his woes. Studge up top only does the latter. Silly as this may sound, maybe we need another expensive signing to take the harsh glare off his back. Hazard at 40 mil (for example) will give him a little breathing space but from that point onwards, his days are numbered. If he doesn't start banging them in, we will have to off-load him. Take my word for it though, wherever he goes next, he will resume his goal-scoring form as if his Chelsea stint never happened. Tricky road, that.

AVB's subs baffled me. Surely, Studge was being Studge but at least he was (kinda) terrorizing the right wing. Taking him off was unnecessary - we should have kept pressing for another goal &amp; judging by the disarray in the ManU backline, it wasn't too far-off, either. He was trying to hold on to 3-0 but we had a good bit of momentum going then. Romeu's introduction kinda slipped back a couple of gears &amp; allowed ManU to show their 'resilience' or whatever it is they call Howard Webb contribution these days. As mentioned elsewhere, Essien should have been subbed off, instead.  Also, I'd have like to see Bertrand get playing time at 3-0 or 3-1. Couldn't have done worse than Bos, could he? 

The FA really needs to pull their head out of their arse and needs to look at the abysmal refereeing this season. AVB is likely to face a touchline ban sometime soon and I'm not sure what we're going to do then. 

The amount of diving by the ManU players horrified me. I think it was probably a secret welcome message for Mourinho - kinda like saying, ""Look! We're eagerly waiting for you &amp;  we've been practising, too!"" (Yeah, I'm not too fond of the Special One anymore. He's going senile, IMHO, and yet again, YMMV. Thanks for reading, though!)

My first ever game was a mid-season friendly at Southend in 1993 when both teams had been knocked out of the FA Cup. 

Being from Essex I've not had the chance to go to too many games at Goodison. The last time I went was the dreadful draw against Wigan last season, which really wasn't worth the trip. Been to the occasional game in London, including a terrible day out at West Ham in the mid 90s, where I got to see Earl ""Bloody"" Barrett give away two penalties for Julian Dicks to score. 

I was also at the game at Leicester where [this happened](http://www.inthestands.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ferguson-freund-choke.jpg).

Now, say that a DW memes/pics subreddit was opened up right around the time that quality began to plummet (this past summer). As the community expanded, people would have had the choice to subscribe the news/discussion subreddit, the memes subreddit, or both. And again, everybody would have been happy, because communities for diverse needs would have developed and people could be selective about what they wanted to see. This issue could have been avoided altogether, because now there's too many people to propose radical change to.

Now, establishing a news/discussion subreddit is a solution to combat the discontent, but not a perfect one, because there's still going to be people hesitant to leave behind the ""go-to"" place for Who-related stuff, including discussion (myself included). It makes much, much, much more sense to exile redundant memes/pics into their own subreddit.

There's a reason you can't post rage comics, memes, etc. in r/funny anymore; they detract from other fresh and original content, but because there's a demand for them, subreddits were established so people could get their fix. With how big r/doctorwho has become, it makes perfect sense for the same thing to happen here so that everybody can be satisfied.

This will save £50 billion of the £110 billion allocated by the DECC to meet carbon targets and this can be accomplished in 2 to 3 decades. This enormous level of tax saving, currently targeted at subsidising inconsequential renewable, can then be spent on health, law and order, education and retirement. The worldwide market for such units is tens of thousands and several UK companies have the capacity and expertise to be part of the supply chain.
