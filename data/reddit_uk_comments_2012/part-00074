More than any other paper? Every news outlet puts their own spin on things as a matter of course, simply by choosing what angle to take on a given story to make it 'fit' with their particular worldview and/or the interests of their readership.

Perhaps you have some specific examples you can cite of when they ""distort the truth or outright lie"" in a way that's not also found in other outlets, but I suspect that most people who delight in denouncing the Mail as uniquely depraved are simply indulging in confirmation bias.

true,ben9345,english,London,"*EDIT: I forgot to include the fact that its not bad thing the Daily Mail has these opinions as much as I disagree with most of them; they are free to have any opinion they want. Its simply that when you read it you are often not getting the whole picture and its written to elicit a response not tell you the truth. While The Guardian or another newspaper might be open to similar criticism of bias it is really only present in the tone of the writing. I have not heard or seen examples of information clearly being left out and the exchange of truth for emotional response in The Guardian and you can be sure your not being misled. By comparison that aim to mislead is endemic in the Daily Mail.*

Ok so i've collected a few articles on topics they definitely take a side on. If you want you can try and find articles giving another point of view or trying to be open minded but i'm fairly sure you won't find any:

**Gay Marriage:** [Article 1](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2116123/Gay-marriage-row-The-real-bigots-liberals.html): (note how he says halfway down the page that calling people ""rude names, or deriding their arguments"" would weaken his case. He says that to try to pretend his argument is more sophisticated all the while with a title calling all liberals ""bigots"" for supporting gay marriage.)

[Article 2](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2114768/Gay-marriage-plans-UK-Father-mother-named-Progenitors-A-B.html): this is an example of their sensationalist reporting trying to get people angry and the only way they can do that is to assume things like the normal names for mother and father would fall out of use if the words in statute are changed. Its bizarre and just there to try to create an uproar supporting their case.

**Health Sensationalism**: [Here is a list of all the things the DM said would cause or increase your risk of cancer with links to the articles that said it.](https://hellokinsella.posterous.com/the-daily-mail-list-of-things-that-give-you-c)
 I got to 100 and gave up not even halfway through. Good Luck.

**Anti-EU**: They make sensationalist claims about how [the EU is trying to ruin Britain and its traditions](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1289882/EU-ban-selling-eggs-dozen-Shopkeepers-fury-told-food-weighed-sold-kilo.html) then when the EU points out that the legislation on non-metric usage allows for 2 simultaneous systems as decided in a [British court case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoburn_v_Sunderland_City_Council) no less they make out that all of the anger in the heads of Daily Mail readers somehow telepathically made the EU leaders back down and its a victory for them not a total loss of journalistic integrity.

In other news...[A **BAN** on all fossil fuel cars making British people ""outlaws in their own land""](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1370955/EU-ban-cars-cities-2050-force-drivers-green.html)...except of course the part about where these were only targets not a ban and the UK swiftly rejected the targets with the Transport Minister saying ""We will not be banning cars from city centres anymore than we will be having rectangular bananas"". That bananas comparison is an slightly inaccurate reference to the fact that the Daily Mail and other newspapers said that the EU was [forcing Britain to ban bananas that were not straight enough before the EU loosened its laws](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1026905/Crooked-cucumbers-bendy-bananas-supermarket-shelves.html) which was utter balls of the highest order as explained in [this short QI clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqVJEZnYiZo). 

**Immigration**: **WARNING: IF YOU WANT TO READ THE COMMENTS ON IMMIGRATION STORIES EXPECT INTERMITTENT RACISM**

[Here's one on both the EU and Immigration!!](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2109008/Secret-EU-deals-forces-Britain-12-000-Indian-workers-despite-soaring-unemployment.html) 

Also, I wasn't aware of this but apparently human rights are less important than getting immigrants out of Daily Mail readers' neighbourhoods. [I think the headline is supposed to be read with intense sarcasm and a snorted laugh at the end.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2152478/Thousands-illegal-immigrants-freed-safeguard-human-rights.html). Perhaps if you add ""{*high pitched, whiney voice*} ne ne ne being imprisoned indefinitely amounts to cruel and inhumane treatment ne ne ne, {*/high pitched, whiney voice*} bit fucking bureaucratic if you ask me"" it might help with the realism. 

**Religion and Atheism:** Whether its fawning over [anyone who defends Christianity](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2113255/Militant-neo-atheists-busting-gut-drive-Christians-radar-says-Delia-mounts-defence-religious-running-battle.html) using very provocative and aggressive words to describe atheists or indeed just [trying to discredit them with bizarre arguments.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2103319/Campaigner-Richard-Dawkins-faces-awkward-truth-money-came-slave-trade.html) all while [telling Muslims off for their religion](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2129678/Its-religion-Muslim-taxi-driver-dumps-family-cab-spotting-unopened-bottle-wine.html) obviously not getting the irony that they support Christians against gay marriage for being against *their* religion. 

[They also think that separating Church and state will bring the country to a stand-still for some reason.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2157905/Church-England-Gay-marriage-plan-force-CofE-split-state.html)

**Monarchy**: [I think the verdict is very much in favour given how concerned they were about the poor Queeny-weeny on her rainy Jubilee day where the country spent millions to virtually worship her. She should have been allowed to bloody sit down. WHAT IS THIS COUNTRY COMING TO?](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2154656/Diamond-Jubilee-2012-Why-Queen-Prince-Philip-left-shiver-rain-FOUR-hours.html)

[especially when she loves Christianity and the C of E.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2101606/Queen-stands-Christianity-Church-England-misunderstood-appreciated.html)

**The BBC**: 

[Love the Queen...but not the BBC :(](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2154222/Queens-Diamond-Jubilee-2012-BBC-sank-tide-wittering-inanity.html)

[Love Christianity...but not the BBC :(](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2045665/Vatican-attacks-foolish-BBC-ditching-BC-AD-PC.html)

true,McCackle,eng-sussex,West Sussex,"Glad to see someone provide some actual examples of what they object to - thanks for doing that.

I've read through the two examples you give, and although I agree both articles clearly are pursuing a particular line/agenda, I really don't feel they are doing so a) in a particularly underhand or dishonest way, or b) to a higher degree than any other major UK news outlet.

In the abortion story, clearly the line they are taking (whether abortion is being increasingly used as contraception or not) is derived from the two anti-abortion organisations they've got quotes from (Pro-life Alliance and LIFE). It would have been a much stronger and balanced article had they sought a counterpoint. Nevertherless, they do present the reader with the data from the report and make it clear that it raises questions about the use of abortion as contraception rather than conclusively demonstrating it. You could argue that's putting an unjustified spin on the data but they also include a first-hand account from someone who did use abortion as contraception (Lucy Lanelly) which gives them some cover to do so. So we have a piece which takes some statistics, highlights what some pressure groups are saying these indicate and backing that up with a personal story, all the while making it clear that although nothing has been proved it certainly fuels the debate over whether abortion is being used as contraception. I don't think this is particularly outrageous or out of the ordinary for comercial news output. The NHS PR response doesn't contradict the Daily Mail article so much as point out what's obvious to anyone who's read it: ""The idea that abortion is used 'as contraception', as reported in the Daily Mail, appears to be an interpretation of the abortion statistics data by critics of the current legislation, with the newspaper quoting pro-life campaign groups and critics of current abortion legislation.""

The second example does seem a much more clear cut case of the Mail misrepresenting the facts to fit an agenda, though I would point out that when it comes to climate change science almost everyone on both sides of the debate has been guilty of doing that at some point.

With both examples I think we should bear in mind that NHS or Met Office PR departments shouldn't be thought of as being without an agenda themselves.

In summary, I don't think the first example is particularly bad. I think the second is. But neither is out of keeping with the output of other news outlets. I'm all for highlighting media bias, dishonesty and malpractice, I just think picking on the Mail in particular is unwarranted and potentially lulls people into a false sense of security when consulting other sources. We should always apply critical judgement to news content, wherever it comes from.

true,michael_ellis_day,null,null,"I'd echo a lot of what's already been said.  Definitely watch the first episode ""An Unearthly Child"" not only for historical reasons but because it really is a lovely story.  Another good one featuring the First Doctor is ""The Aztecs"" which is a kind of story they never do anymore -- an adventure in a historical period without any SF elements.  Also highly recommended is ""The Time Meddler.""

The best story featuring the Second Doctor that still exists is his very last one, ""The War Games.""  Unfortunately, it's around four hours long!  (It originally aired in ten parts.)  ""Tomb of the Cybermen"" is a good one to see, especially if four hours is too much of a commitment.

A good standalone one with the Third Doctor is ""Carnival of Monsters.""  Another is ""The Time Warrior"" which introduces both the Sontarans and the wonderful Sarah Jane Smith.

For the Fourth Doctor, ""The Talons of Weng-Chiang"" is definitely one of the very best, as is ""City of Death.""

As a taste of what makes the Fifth Doctor special, a good story is ""Kinda.""  His best is his last story, ""The Caves of Androzani.""

The Sixth Doctor is a tricky case, because his era was cut short and had a lot of problems.  A lot of people recommend ""Vengeance on Varos"" as his best story.

The Seventh Doctor has the great ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" and ""The Curse of Fenric.""

For the Eighth Doctor, there's only the one televised appearance: the American-made tv-movie.  This one also includes the Seventh Doctor, which was a unique approach to changing over from one Doctor to another by doing it in the middle of the story.

The main evidence is the old railway lines running through the suburbs - the collieries moved their coal (and their miners) by rail. A lot of these are footpaths now. The walls from old railway bridges are visible all over the city. Looking down on the city from a satellite map, it's possible to trace the paths of the old lines using these visual clues.

true,DoubleBrownClown,1953,Gianfranco Zola,"&gt;Duplicate discussions will be discouraged by moderators as much as possible. I'm sure you've seen me try to clamp down on duplicate threads by pointing out the alternate threads. The idea here is to keep discussion centralized and to reduce clutter on our main page (we're growing and this is becoming more and more problematic). This approach is what we'll adopt as opposed to simply removing dupes. It'd also make our job much easier if the community helps out as well.

I know what you're saying here, but just to give some examples the RAMIRES!!!!!!, DROGBA!!!!!!!! posts in the semi and then the final were everywhere. Ill admit I even contributed to making one.

But I kind of think it was okay because there were so many crazy roller-coaster moments this season and we weren't expected to come away with anything so everyone was justifiably excited. BUT once the season starts up again these posts that are just celebrating one moment, like ramires' goal or Terry's sending off ahve to be stopped. They should be kept in the match threads either here or on /r/soccer as comments.

Oh and another thing, those  ""I think we should start with this line up"" threads should be contained. Maybe (just for bigger games with more anticipation where this sort of thing happens more frequently) a post gets created a couple of days ahead of time where people can share their ideas, because its still great to share these things but just not by adding to more clutter to the /r/chelseafc homepage.

In terms of the best places to stay as a tourist, i would say anything in the centre of town would be good - so that would be anything marked [Old](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Town,_Edinburgh) or [New](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Town,_Edinburgh) town, which are the two central areas of Edinburgh.  Slightly further afield, but no less nice, [Bruntsfield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruntsfield), the [Meadows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Meadows_\(park\)) and [Morningside](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morningside,_Edinburgh) are all really nice areas with lots of students, nice cafes/bars/restaurants.  Probably the 'hippest' area of Edinburgh at the moment is [Stockbridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockbridge,_Edinburgh), which is supposed to be the up and coming arty area, and from what i've seen is actually very pleasant.  I'm quite partial to [Broughton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broughton,_Edinburgh) too

Central Edinburgh is very safe, but further out there are definitely some areas you'd want to avoid.  I live in [Leith] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leith), which is famous for being one of the rougher areas of the city (Trainspotting is set in Leith).  Where i live is actually very nice - around the Shore, where there has been a lot of redevelopment and are some very fancy restaurants - but there are some streets and neighbourhoods very near me where i definitely wouldn't walk around on my own at night.  [Gorgie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgie) is another one to avoid.

Hope this is all useful.  Don't let the second paragraph put you off - as i say, Edinburgh is overall a very safe city.  We also have a very good bus network, so don't worry about living somewhere slightly further out because you'll easily be able to get a bus in to town.

The only final thing i would say is that if you are coming in August - when the [festival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival) takes place - you'll find all the accomodation much more expensive, so will probably be forced slightly further out from the centre.",0,1339926013,null,0,false,0,c51peo8,t3_v65yt,t1_c51peo8,t3_v65yt,null,1429162372,1,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,1

You kind of were. There's nothing they can do to help you if it's out of warranty. They don't set the prices, and they aren't authorised to do things like repair out of warranty iPhones. They are not there to fix the customers problems, they're there to sell products and make the company money.

About the only thing you could do is try to talk to someone in management. And even then the management is likely to fob you off anyway as it's out of warranty and therefore not their problem.

true,lilythekitten,eng-northumberland,The NORTH,"&gt; it sounds like the decision would be up to Apple and what they would consider a fair amount of time for the power button to last

Actually, it's up to a 'reasonable person' to determine that (in practical terms, a judge). Since the iPhone costs a pretty hefty amount of money I don't think it's reasonable a component as vital to the device's operation as the power button should only last 18 months, and I doubt most judges would either.

That said, since it's more than 6 months since purchase the burden is on OP to prove that the issue is an inherent fault and not due to misuse, abuse or external force, which may be tricky. I've generally heard Apple's customer service is quite good though, so if you kick up enough of a fuss (politely and in the correct way) then you might get something out of this without too much struggle.

If all else fails you can always take it to court, it doesn't cost a great deal even if you lose so might be worth it.

true,noradrenaline,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"The [Fulbright Commission](http://www.fulbright.org.uk/) have a huge amount of information on coming to the UK from the USA to study, and offer scholarships to the academically brilliant.

As an international student, if you choose a science course (like Biology, not Medicine which is vastly more expensive) at a good university (the Russell Group is our equivalent of your Ivy League, and I'm using Manchester as an example), you'll be paying £15,500 a year in fees alone.  This doesn't cover accommodation, books, the cost of living, any travel home or visa fees.  

Our degrees work differently too - you choose to study one (occasionally two) subjects throughout your three years at university.  You might get one or two free choice courses depending on your university and course, but these are often restricted to certain faculties, and within your timetable.  You study your one subject in a great deal of depth, rather than in the USA where you study a broad range of subjects but not in any great detail.  

The [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree#United_Kingdom) is a bit confusing, but may make for useful reading for you.  

Also note that depending on your secondary school qualifications/grades, you may very well have to take a foundation year course, as you may not have studied to the level necessary to start the course.  I don't fully understand the Advanced Placement system, but according to [UCAS](http://www.ucas.ac.uk/students/ucas_tariff/tarifftables/), who run the central application system for all students applying to UK universities, a course that asks for three A grades at A-level is the equivalent to three grade 5 results in different group A courses.  From what I can find, group A courses are [hard sciences, calculus, languages and history.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCAS_Tariff#Advanced_Placement_Exams).  I may be completely misinterpreting the system, so don't rely entirely on what I've said here.

In any case, I hope you find out what you're looking for.  I'm happy to answer any more questions about university life in the UK - I'm going into my final year of a Biology degree at the University of Manchester and have friends doing a wide range of courses at a wide range of universities.",0,1339934914,null,0,false,0,c51q0p8,t3_v65ll,t1_c51q0p8,t3_v65ll,null,1429162663,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,jesst,english,London,"Hi, I'm an American also and I have thoroughly looked into what you are talking about doing. My fiancé is British, but when I first started this process he was not my fiancé. 

First let me say that the $25,000 estimation for student loan debt is absolutely not right. They took a very small sampling of schools and there is no way you are only leaving with $25,000 of debt. I was former US Navy and only went through 2 years of school and I left with more than $25,000. This means that even after I used my GI bill to pay for schooling I still had MORE than what they are claiming is the national average. 

Graduating from an American High School is the equivalent of your A-Levels. Your SAT/ACT scores don't matter. My application process was slightly different than yours, because I am former military and because I graduated high school 10 years ago, but if you need I can tell you what I had to do. 

What do you want to go to school for? I am going for Linguistics and London really appealed to me. However, if you are going for something more science or tech related Bristol is an awesome city. My fiancé went to school in Bristol and he absolutely loves Bristol. 

The costs of living are differently proportioned in the UK than they are in the US. Some things are cheaper (you don't need to own a car in most of the UK for example) but other things are more expensive (Some food items can be a lot more expensive, but I find going out to eat to be cheaper in the UK) What your costs of living are going to be will also depend on where you go to school. Bristol will be cheaper than London (hell pretty much anywhere will be cheaper than London). There is a minimum requirement for how much money you need to have (your student loans count towards this amount), but the amount is much higher if the school you are attending is in London or outside the city.

I have 2 cost of attendance spreadsheets for the 2 schools that I applied to. Your figures will be different based on your course you take (mine is linguistics), and where you go to school. Keep in mind, London is much more expensive than other schools, and you can scrimp and save on some things. Your student visa will allow you to work for 20 hours / week. And also you do qualify for student loans (only through Sallie Mae) and you can get Financial aid.

[Here is a COA example for Queen Mary London](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArigxRVVcuPDdDN4VWVWYU04NFF1ZWsyTkp0TWlVaVE) (located in Mile End London) the ""welfare"" option is if you want to do it on the cheap.

[Here is an example for Kingston University](http://ompldr.org/vZWRlYQ) It's located in Kingston-Upon-Thames which is on the far south-west side of the city, and not really inside the city.

However, you can't simultaneously claim that we should address the minimum wage, but it would be a bad thing if low-paid jobs could disappear without subsidy. The point of the minimum wage is that it's the baseline for what an *employer* must pay, if they have to pay more than the job's worth to them then they won't employ.

Not that this amount of care from my mother is unusual, she's been doing the same for him at home for a couple of years now. That said, now that the hospital have seen him, they want him put in permanent care. Even though the hospital are incapable of giving him the level of care my mother has been providing.

Aside from being devastated that her father has to be put in to a care home, she's also worried that she'll still be tied up visiting more than socially still to ensure he isn't neglected. This is all while they are likely essentially to take all of his assets (house/pension) to fund for the care.

I don't want to be overly pessimistic on the matter, but it's almost as though the state is set to chicken coop the elderly and take away peoples inheritance as payment. Not that money issue for my parents, they recently paid for £9k wet-room bathroom at my granddad's house to ensure my mother and uncle could keep him clean. Perhaps its just how the system has to work for families that can't/don't care for their elderly relatives.

They already do that; many unions (Unite definitely) have a strike fund that pays out to people who miss work due to official strike action.  Not their whole day rate, of course, but an amount towards it - it's all part of what you put your subscription fees.

Also - the money is also put towards many other negotiating tactics; a strike is never 'just announced' - there are weeks\months of discussions leading up to such a situation, and at every stage along the way, the union is reaching out to the company to get to a negotiated common ground; strikes are only ever announced when a company has dug its heels in and has said NO to anything.

Of course, you're never going to know that, unless you work for the company involved, or are in the Union that's doing the negotation; you'll only ever here of strike action popping up, since it would be dead boring to read in the national press that ""Today, Unite started negotiations for a pay award, etc."" day in, day out for a month or so, until it moved onto strike action.  And keeping THAT point in mind - there's many more disputes solved WITHOUT strikes and industrial action; that's what's being done every day of the week.

When you hear stories in the standard about strikers taking the piss, this is usually someone who earns a lot trying to earn a bit more. Often at the expense of the public. Strikes involving, for example, cleaning staff campaigning for a basic living wage against a highly profitable corporate are less well reported as they are not as sensational and dont fit with right wing media's anti strike agenda. They happen pretty often.

Unions often don't have enough money to replace full wages, especially for a long dispute. I agree that if unions can pay then they should. It follows that a lot of the unions of lower paid workers arn't rolling in money because they are funded by the poorest workers.

true,McCackle,eng-sussex,West Sussex,"&gt; Of course the working tax credit supports these people - but your earlier comment hides the fact that subsidy is inherent in its working.

I'm not sure if *subsidy* is really the right word. Yes, employers indirectly benefit but the tax credit is paid to the individual and targeted helping *them*. I don't see the tangential benefit to the employer as being a chief consideration or concern, but of course I don't deny it's there.

&gt; However, you can't simultaneously claim that we should address the minimum wage, but it would be a bad thing if low-paid jobs could disappear without subsidy.

No, I recognise that ""unfortunate dilemma"" as you term it, all I'm saying is that the right way to deal with livable wage issues is to reform/increase the minimum wage, not attack working tax credits - so I think we agree on that.

Tennant (who often sports stubble both in his ordinary life and in multiple roles) can be seen [here](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpfx2vGL8F1qfmcyqo1_400.png) in the fullest beard I could find

Delusions or grandeur or an unwavering determination to be the best? As the great Bill Nicholson once said “It is better to fail aiming high than to succeed aiming low. And we of Spurs have set our sights very high, so high in fact that even failure will have in it an echo of glory.”

If rumours are to be believed Redknapp was offered a new contract before England appointed Roy Hodgson but he turned it down, and it’s been said that he flirted with the Chelsea job last summer before they appointed AVB. When it became clear that he would leave Spurs for the England job if it was offered to him he put Levy in an impossible position. How could Levy offer him a new contract in the full knowledge that he would abandon the club should a more attractive or lucrative proposition present itself? Especially as it’s quite conceivable that Hodgson might fail with England and Redknapp would once again be the number one contender and the people’s choice for the England job. It was clear then that a parting of the ways was on the cards, Levy just had the foresight to beat him to the punch.

Redknapp did relatively well at Spurs but let’s not get too carried away with his achievements, we need to look at his tenure in context. In the three years prior to his appointment Spurs had two 5th place finishes under Martin Jol. We’re it not for a dodgy lasagne it’s more than likely that one of those would have been a 4th place finish and with it qualification for the champions league. Spurs also beat Chelsea to win the league cup under Juande Ramos. That was all achieved with a squad that was far inferior to the one that Redknapp had at his disposal.

Redknapp was also lucky to inherit two outstanding young players in Gareth Bale and Luka Modric. Credit has to be given for turning Bale into the player he is now and for adding some much needed experience in Parker and Gallas. But he did little to convince the Spurs board that they should trust him to make big money signings because for every Parker there’s a Crouch, Palacios, Bassong or Pienaar, and I suspect this is the reason Spurs have been relatively quiet in the transfer marker in past couple of years. The core of the squad that Redknapp inherited was put together largely by Frank Arnesen and Damien Comolli who both used an extensive scouting network and put Spurs’ limited resources to good use by buying young players with potential. Adding value to the squad in this way is the only hope Spurs have of competing with the likes of Chelsea and Man City. It’s a policy that must continue but is completely at odds with Redknapp’s modus operandi in the transfer market, namely his penchant for older premier league journeymen who because of their age have little or no sell on value.

Then there’s Redknapp’s relationship with the media which even Spurs supporters were sometimes uncomfortable with, so one can only imagine how the board of directors felt as Harry gave yet another interview out of his car window.

Then there’s the late season capitulation that coincided with the England speculation. A run which saw Spurs lose 5-2 to Arsenal followed by one win in eight games surrendering third place and a 10 point lead to the their most bitter rivals. That in of itself is bad enough but for it to cost the club champions league qualification and a potential £30m in lost revenue is unforgivable.

There were clearly lots of factors that went into Levy’s decision to sack Redknapp, a decision which he himself admitted was far from easy, so to suggest that the Spurs board have delusions grandeur is simply untrue.",0,1339948059,null,0,false,0,c51ri89,t3_v6haq,t1_c51ri89,t3_v6haq,null,1429163349,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

Ten ways I think this article misses the point:

1. Spurs actually very clearly a very well run club at present. That has very obviously not always been the case.
2. The points D Conn makes about privately financed stadia feel contradictory: surely, as the article hints, Spurs actually looking like the club most likely to next succeed with privately financing development (the public money involved is a drop in the ocean, the vast majority are private).
3. The ""money men"" pictured are precisely un-like the ""money men"" rightly despised elsewhere: they aren't bottomless wells (Chels, Man C) and they aren't parasitic speculators (Liverp, Villa). I don't know them or claim to have particular insight here, but the evidence appears to be that they are careful investors.
4. Since Lewis/Levy and co took over at Spurs the consistent overall trend has been toward improvement on and off the pitch; certainly bumpy, but year on year better. When Levy took over he was not popular. Most fans now appreciate we have made progress since then and that it is down to him.
5. As others above have said; Redknapp made himself un-retainable. To say ""Harry's only out for himself"" has become an affectionate truism. We're all self serving to some extent, but some have sharper elbows than others. Redknapp's conduct towards the club since he was offered a three-year deal on improved terms earlier this year has been v poor. Whilst publicly claiming he was happy at Spurs, he has (as everyone knows) strained every fibre to leave for the England job. During the period he thought it was in the bag, he was (at the very least) wilfully negligent: he talked up the leaving of stars and made bizarre substitutions. Redknapp's endlessly repeated ""2 points from 8 games"" when he took over has an unfortunate echo in his own form at the end of this season.
6. His results have been generally good, whilst working with generally good materials. He inherited the best players we have. Others have analysed this above, but the only really excelent signings I personally credit him with are Parker and Adebayor; Jol's results demonstrate he is flattered by inheriting a squad that was improving generally and was just very unhappy under Ramos. 
7. Consider Redknapp's form with chairmen he did (temporarily) get on with. Portsmouth, for example: look where that landed (a) the club (b) the fans (c) Redknapp and Mandaric themselves...
8. Redknapp's form at his previous clubs is marked by unsustainable overachievement, short-term galvanising and quick-fix expense. I think the comparison with Leeds under O'Leary is wide of the mark (if only because Levy has acted quickly enough) but I see where it is coming from. 
9. Sacking Redknapp is actually the sane, non-delusional thing to do. To pretend Redknapp was aiming at the long-term success and stability of Spurs is delusional.
10. And ""Delusions of grandeur""??? Of course Spurs have delusions of grandeur. We always have had. Sometimes we have delusions of grandeur and sometimes, in very small portions, our delusions are deluded.

Personally I'd like all submissions to be kept in there but it's not in our domain to restrict submissions from certain sites.

I also don't see the point in having 5-10 submission regarding a player that we are only vaguely linked to.

I think having semi-daily aggregate 'transfer rumour threads' is a great idea, and would cut down on all the clutter on the front page; I would like to see something like amsid's suggestion of having it sticky'd with different colour font and people linking to different articles about rumoured targets within the comments.

Within those designated threads though I don't see any reason to restrict postings from tabloid newspapers that are usually unreliable, or restricting postings about certain players who ""we are only vaguely linked to"". It's silly season! it's a time for dreaming, that's half the fun. there's no reason to restrict hypothetical discussion regarding how a player might fit into our team, or why we would or would not like to sign a certain player however unlikely this signing may actually be.

It was a gigantic bloody war that not only touched the lives of pretty much everyone in the country, with 4 million British men serving and just shy of 900000 of them dying (350000 in one battle alone), it took place little more than a 4hr drive away from our capital city.

As for the fascism, people act like the Mail was a voice in the wilderness on this issue. It wasn't. Fascism was a popular ideology (along with communism) during the inter-war years, even during the opening stages of WW2. The depression, combined with the explosion in new political ideas around the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century resulted in fascism being a common idea right across Europe.

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"&gt; On the subject of transfer rumors I think it would be nice if we could have certain sites that are known for posting unreliable transfers flagged. I believe r/soccer used to have a piece of poop pop up next to anything posted from sites like goal.com. I think if we had a similar system, although not a piece of poop (maybe a yellow or red card?), it would be a way of discouraging posts from those sites while not completely banning them.

We're not going to do that, it was too controversial even for r/soccer. They had it for every submission from those domains, even if they weren't transfer stories, some sites had the icon that many argued didn't deserve it, other sites didn't have it that many argued should have it...it was a huge mess. Not something I want to bring here.

&gt; On a separate note, I feel that mid-game goal celebration threads (and other threads of this sort) should be banned. I know this was brought up a few months ago, but it wasn't mentioned in this post. Threads that just say ""DRROOOOOOGGGBBBBBBAAAAA!"" posted right after he scored contribute almost nothing, and yet fragment the discussion in the other threads. The match thread is there for a reason.

Nothing we can do specifically, I'd encourage you to downvote threads that you disagree with. 

&gt; Edit: Also, meet up threads. I don't really see a problem with them now (I only remember seeing more that one or two a game just before the champions league final), but as the sub grows it could be a problem. I think if it starts to get out of hand, in addition to the pre-match thread we could have a meet up thread posted a day or two before the games that could be linked to in the side bar match widget thingy.

Or, X-Files. Especially if you have a Doctor Who craving.

Mulder has all the crazy ideas and charisma while Scully brings the knowledge, skepticism, and old-fashioned heroism. (I consider Scully to be my favorite companion.)

You are a fool if you think earning a few extra quid per hour would stop this or that working longer shifts makes perfectly good people commit acts of needless cruelty.

Nurses have become an untouchable group of people in terms of criticism. In the NHS you can criticise managers, bureaucrats and doctors, but nurses (and patients themselves) are no go areas. We need to wise up and realise that nurses are human and therefore need to be judged based on their own actions, rather than assuming they can innately do no wrong so any wrongdoing that comes from them must be down to other factors.

My own experience of nurses hasn't been particularly good. If I received treatment like this in a shop I would either complain, not shop there again or both. But there's nowhere else to go with the NHS, so often patients are stuck with horrible nurses.

If you're still within your original contract and you're getting nowhere with Apple, then your phone is something that is provided as part of the contract.  If it does turn out to be faulty (and not something that was caused by you), then T-Mobile should provide you with another phone or fix the one you've got. If they don't, they've broken the contract.

Even if you're not still within your original contract, Apple are under no obligation to provide a repair/replacement as they are not the company who sold it to you, T-Mobile are.  The phone should last ""a reasonable amount of time"", and you should be able to argue that, since 24 month contracts with this phone are available (even if you didn't have one), it is not unreasonable to expect the phone to last at least two years.

I believe T-Mobile offer help through their website by email or IM, and (I think) Twitter, if you think you'd be more able to put forward your case in writing.

true,TLKv3,null,null,"I would prefer if former ""top"" DW writers would come back for a 6 episode Super-Series. 6 separate hour and a half ""Special"" Episodes that comprise the 50th Anniversary Series. Six former DW writers being RTD, Neil Gaiman, Moffat being 3 of those 6 writers.

The over-arching story being The Eleventh Doctor is lured into 5 ""traps"" in different time periods by an unknown force. In each time period he inevitably collects an item that if left in that time period could disrupt time (such as advanced tech from our century being left in the 18th century, etc.). To add incentive, you could have a former incarnation of The Doctor be ""in unknown peril"" if The Eleventh doesn't go back to save them. An easy means for explaining why the former Doctors look so ""old"" now (because of actor's age), you can have the TARDIS blow a fuse that lets The Eleventh see his former incarnations' ages as if they never regenerated and were the same age as him. Since it's been ""hundreds"" of years since their time, if they never regenerated and were The Eleventh's age now they would surely have aged physically.

As an added fan-fare bonus, Neil Gaiman's episode could bring back Idris/The TARDIS in human form and RTD's episode could bring back David Tennant. And to explain why the TARDIS blew the fuse, have the returning Idris/TARDIS say she did it on purpose because The Eleventh was getting to comfortable with himself and too vain/egotistical as well as complacent and needed some small dose of reality that everything changes over time.

As far as the ending to the Series goes, reveal that a remnant of The Master's cult survived since time was re-written and has tricked The Doctor into collecting the items for them. They then steal the TARDIS (since all the items would be inside it) with River Song inside and cause it to self-destruct while it hurls back in time and everywhere in time (explaining why the TARDIS was exploding in Series 5's finale). It was the Cult's way of ripping open time to pull someone through using their collected items, old Gallifreyan artifacts... The Master.

And for, again, added fan-fare, have The Master been ""punished"" by being forced to regenerate into Benedict Cumberbatch and re-programmed back to his old self. A menacing, super intellectual schemer who always somehow finds a way to get a win even in defeat (killing a companion, injuring a loved one of The Doctor, etc.). And have The Eleventh, Tenth and a potentially ""shock return"" of The Ninth come back to save the day.

In his younger days, the Doctor could say that Thomas E. Reynolds has some resemblance to himself.  That was a long time ago and the Doctor has some traveling to do.  However the Doctor cannot simply ignore the uncanny feeling that he has about Reynolds, so he decides to spend some time researching his mysterious and charismatic doppelgänger.  Reynolds can't be anyone important or he'd know about him beforehand, yet he appears to be a media darling, so that's something.   

Somehow, despite having no prior knowledge of Thomas E. Reynolds, the Doctor senses a personal history between himself and this particular man.  Maybe from another lifetime, Reynolds was a foe, or even an ally of the Doctor's.  Then the Doctor thinks to himself about the nature of pseudonyms; they conceal identities of their users, even though the pieces of the person are on display, hidden in plain sight.  Thomas E. Reynolds, by that line of logic, is then an anagram.  A simple, deceptive trick with which the Doctor is familiar.  Who'd employ this against him?  Who'd take the time to get the Doctor's attention in this way, by making himself appear like the man did a couple of lifetimes ago?  Why does this *modus operandi* bear some resemblance to t...

true,captain_ramshackle,uk,Kingston Upon Thames,"**Gross National Stereotypes**

At the first level you stereotype people by what country within the United Kingdom they're from. This gives the common ones

* Welsh - sheep shaggers

* Scottish - cheap and drunk

* Irish - drunk

* English - intolerant and emotionally repressed

**Gross Regional Stereotypes**

Then you go down to the regions with a country, for example in England you could go for.

* North East - drunken vikings

* North West - drunken shepherds

* Midlands - funny accents

* East Anglia - flat and boring

* South West- Scones and cow tipping

* South East - expensive houses

**County Stereotypes**

Then within a region you can start being rude to individual counties for example there are strong rivalries between Yorkshire and Lancashire with unique sets of stereotypes.

**City Stereotypes**

Then you get down to intertown stereotypes like people from Liverpool being car thieves and people from Manchester not being able to dance.

**Town Stereotypes**

Then you have stereotypes related to individual towns e.g. Millom has a reputation for sheep shagging even though it's in the North West.

**Village Stereotypes**

Then you get down to villages a mere mile apart where they claim to have distinct cultures.


Basically in the UK stereotypes are a near infinitely dividable attribute and everyone claims to have something rude to stay about everyone else.

&gt; If you take part in industrial action when you are not a trade union member you are normally treated as taking part in unofficial action. This means that if you are dismissed while taking part in the action you normally have no right to complain of unfair dismissal.

&gt; You can still claim if the reason for your dismissal was automatically unfair.

&gt; You are treated as taking part in official action if both:

&gt;  *    members of a trade union are taking part in it
&gt;  *    the action is official industrial action taken by their trade union

&gt; This means that the law treats you in the same way as it treats trade union members. Your rights if you are dismissed depend on whether the industrial action is protected or unprotected and when you are dismissed.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Worryingly it seems the gaming community as a whole is rather apathetic about this. There was a recent thread about this in /r/games where the consensus tended to be that it's not much of an issue, and the comments on the Guardian website seem to say the same thing, but even so they seem to think that a couple of games like Portal which have female protagonists who aren't in skimpy suits and have a modicum of independence make up for the vast majority of gaming material. A TL;DR: of their arguments would be 'OK, it's wrong, but this stuff is said a lot and it's completely unavoidable anyway'

You're right in saying that there are changes, but I would argue that they are very slow indeed. Many people blame developers pandering to a market, but I think the community is partly responsible - just look at some of the mods for Skyrim - the most popular are ones which give your female companions skimpy armour or nude mods. And not many people buy them to see Arngeir the Greybeard in the nip. 

I'm speaking from a more 'casual' perspective, but video games are the most misogynistic media I have come across, bar comics. Jesus Christ, comics are bad.

Final? Edit: If the Doctor Who crossover with Star Trek is to be considered canon, then why not treat the Whoniverse like the leading comics companies w/ their multiverse comics. Maybe the Master breaks through a dimension from which he's the hero, and the Doctor (Valeyard?) is now out to not only ruin the goody two-shoes Doctor, but also destroy the good Master, who reluctantly resurrects the evil Master as a team up effort to save the Doctor?

How reliable those reports are, I don't know, but most of our best players are on long contracts and I can see Levy holding out for ridiculous money, unless Modric throws a massive bitch fit and refuses to even show up for training.

It's worth doing a bit of research about where to live because, despite all the stories that circulate in the US about us being a socialist utopia/nightmare^*, quality of life varies a lot over fairly small distances (everything from healthcare, educational opportunities, crime/safety, facilities etc.).  To a large extent it's reflected in house/rent prices, but you can still find sweet-spots within a given budget.

As was stated before me The Doctor is outside of the universe, the void quite possibly. The Doctor's existence hinges upon her remembrance of him. Now for a bit of backstory so you can follow my thinking to its conclusion. The TARDIS IS EXPLODING all of time is unraveling and ceasing to exist. The DOCTOR is trapped in the Pandorica, Amy is shot, and Rory is an Auton Roman. The Pandorica was made to hold the Doctor. However Amy's thoughts of him are so strong that it recognizes her as The Doctor (sort-of). Thus it opens up, Doctor's out and Amy steps in. Amy's thoughts of the Doctor are so powerful that they can open the Pandorica. Flash forward to the future where The Doctor Kamikazes the Pandorica into the TARDIS creating another Big Bang with everything but himself because he's in the Pandorica/TARDIS. Of course before he's erased from that timeline he stresses the point of being remembered. He tells her that all she needs to do is to remember him, THE GIRL THAT LIVED WITH THE CRACK IN TIME WITHOUT EVER BEING PULLED INTO IT. THAT IF SHE CAN REMEMBER HER PARENTS THEY WILL EXIST.

I am personally apathetic about this. I love Femshep, I love Alyx Vance, I play as Zoey in Left 4 Dead, I often make my character female when given the choice. However, there are two sides to every coin and in this case the other side ain't so rosy either.

I, as a man, am a disposable piece of worthless cannon fodder. I live solely to rescue women from whatever predicament they've gotten themselves in to this time. I will be overly muscular, I will speak with a gruff, 'manly' voice. Despite my size, I will be beaten up and often killed routinely by women who are less than half my size. I will be portrayed as flawed and vulnerable, while my female counterparts will be perfect Mary Sues, incapable of failure and the world will become enraged when this isn't the case. 

It may very well be selfish of me to feel this way, but I am tired of listening to these hyperbolic 'Misogyny!

1. A tricky away fixture against West Brom, a team we didn't do well against this year and now headed up by our Steve Clarke, who has a penchant for tactical victories over former clubs.

2. Man City at Anfield, our first home game under Rodgers against the undisputed best team in the league. Imagine trying to play a new possession/passing game against this sort of line up.

3. Arsenal at home. Another game we didn't win this year. If we fail to get a win off the first two, the pressure could already be mounting. Again we're trying to play a new passing game against the British masters of the passing game.

4. Sunderland away

5. Man Utd at home. Need I explain the explosive nature of this game?

If things don't go our way, if we don't come out of the blocks in storming form, we could be at the end of september without a win. That brings us to a run of games we really hope to be winning this season, in terrible form and confidence; Norwich, Stoke, Reading. And then we're back to brutal periods (Everton, Newcastle, Chelsea, Tottenham in 6 fixtures).

That would be the nightmare scenario where come december, we're in a Hodgson-esque relegation spot and stars are once again unsettled.

Of course the opposite could happen, if we start strongly and anfield is a fortress once again, we could get to our november-december difficult run sitting pretty with wins against 3 of the top 4 at home and a host of could results under our belt giving us confidence.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I wouldn't say more likely, but I think everything people have been saying about Ade's wage demands is a bit overblown. Everything I've seen this season is that Ade got along very well with the players and staff and finally started enjoying his football again. I don't see him wanting to go back to Man City to be benched again, and any club that can afford his wages already have better options, or are looking at younger, more promising players.

As for Modders, I think it all hinges on how much of his professionalism he's willing to torpedo. Like I said, I'm hopeful that he'll keep his head down and work at it for another season, particularly because he was one of our most disappointing players during our poor spell (not to say he was the worst, but he was definitely the one furthest below their usual standards, imo). He's under contract under 2015 anyways, and I think that the value in keeping him is worth more than the 10m he would lose in value if we sold him a year on. Modric is the key, I think. We lose him, and all hell could potentially break loose unless we signed a high profile replacement for him immediately, which I don't see happening, for the same reasons Modric wants to leave.

And our chances, I have no idea. We were optimistic about Juande Ramos, and the man had a hell of a resume, and we all know how that turned out. The most I can hope for right now is to have a new manager by the end of the month so our transfer window can begin in earnest and we can start acquiring some players. We've been on the brink of signing Vertonghen for what seems like ages now. Luckily, that seems like a Levy deal, not 'arry (of course, since Vertonghen is under 30 and not English), so I'm confident that it'll still go through. That'll help our defensive depth a massive amount, since we were ravaged by injuries there last season, and we'll have Caulker and Naughton returning from loan deals, who have impressed (last I heard, Rodgers has had some interest in Caulker?). So if we can keep the squad together, trim some of the deadwood (Bentley, Jenas, Bassong, etc), bring in a high profile signing or two (Vertonghen + striker), get some true wingers for rotation (currently only got Bale and Lennon. That killed us when Lennon was out), and a cover striker or two for cheap, and I'll feel confident of a top 4 finish, provided that the players respond to the new manager, but everything hinges on that. Get the managerial choice right, and everything else will come. Mess that up, and we may have another ""2 points, 8 games"" scenario on our hands.

Tax-wise, there's several taxes to account for but most of them don't require you to be familiar with the tax system:

   * Income tax and National Insurance are taken directly out of your wages, and unless you have two or more sources of income you generally don't need to worry about these. Expect to lose about a third of your salary to these. These are national taxes levied by central government.
   * Council tax is levied by your local council. This is based on the value of your house and is a fixed fee that most people choose to pay monthly. The fixed fee is per household, not per occupant - so if you rent a room in a shared house it's much cheaper.
      * Don't miss any payments because the ability to pay monthly is a privilege, not a right - if you miss payments, the council can and will take you to court for the entire year's tax in one go.
   * VAT is charged on most items and is included in the price displayed in store. It's not like in the US: here, if it says £4.99 on the shelf and you have a £5 note, you can afford it. There are no local sales taxes.

Other things to be aware of:

   * If you want a car, expect to spend a lot of money. Petrol's very expensive, you need to pay an annual tax on the car itself and if it's over three years old, you must get it MOT'd every year. Insurance is also compulsory, and also very expensive. Speed and traffic-light cameras are everywhere; exceed the speed limit and sooner or later you **will** attract attention. The fine isn't too bad - it's only £60 provided you're not hugely over the limit - but each offence attracts 3 penalty points. Amassing 12 points in under three years will see your license automatically revoked.
      * If you live in a big city, you may not need a car.
   * You need a license to watch broadcast TV. You can buy this license from the post office or online.",0,1340011602,null,0,false,0,c523885,t3_v7g8h,t1_c523885,t3_v7g8h,null,1429169024,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"I've worked in mental health for 10 years and can confirm that yes, the system is terrible and yes that 25% figure seems about right. However, I'm not entirely convinced by the proposed remedy. Basically, government has become obsessed with CBT as the magic bullet for mild to moderate mental health problems and from a certain perspective I can see why: On the face of it it's measurable (more so than counselling), cheaper than other approaches and fits very well into a ticky-box type way of doing things. It's quite a mechanistic approach and that has a certain appeal for those who hold the purse strings. The problem is that at best, CBT works for some people some of the time (in fact I'd say that it's about 50/50... half of people will gain some benefit from it, half won't) and what we've essentially done is put all our eggs into this one therapeutic basket at the expense of other approaches. That's really bad news because the dirty little secret of the mental health world is that we don't know half as much about how people actually work as we should. We don't know why certain things work for some people and not for others and we have a very limited understanding of the nature of mental illness. So while it seems great that talking therapies are going to be more available (it's certainly better than the situation right now), this will not fix things in the way that the government seem to think it will.",0,1340012232,null,0,false,0,c523a31,t3_v7shm,t1_c523a31,t3_v7shm,null,1429169048,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22

Of course it depends on your particular specialisation, but my girlfriend has just completed a PhD in neuroendocrinology (with an undergraduate degree in pharmacology, and job experience at Pfizer) from a good university in the UK and is having trouble finding a job.  Pfizer has completely pulled out of the country flooding the market with lots of PhDs with industrial research experience trying to find a job.  Her position is more constrained in that I've just been offered a job back in the UK, so she has to find one in a similar area, but the market is still pretty bleak.

As for salaries, for a first postdoc you're looking at from £28,000 -- £35,000 and for a more senior postdoc role a salary of between £35,000 -- £45,000.  That's for a standard BBSRC/EPSRC funded postdoc, where the higher end will be paid for those working in the South East.  For specialised roles, like Oxbridge research fellowships, you get paid a much lower salary but will be offered accommodation and meals for free via the college you join.

There's also a handful of other Fellowships available, like EPSRC/BBSRC junior research fellowships but for lab based science these are not particularly useful as they typically do not include lab expenses, and the EU's Marie Curie fellowships, though EU paperwork is terrible and I think the call is not open for about another 6 months, though you should check.  If you're a not a British citizen a possible source of funding will be a Royal Society fellowship which is for the sole purpose of bringing non-Britons into the UK and I believe they have some funding for the lab.

She is on heavy duty anti depressants and has suffered all her life with both depression and anxiety (she is 70 now).  But aside from a 5 days stint in a local clinic when she had a breakdown year and years ago, she has NEVER had any counselling on the NHS.  Just pills.  Oh, and last week a GP told her to ""go and sit in some sun"".  
  
Anyway, her state of mind has been escalating downwards recently so we had to go outside the remit of her GP and contacted the clinic where she was years ago.  It was a weekend, the GP was shut and she was losing her mind.   They couldn't help but arranged for a psychiatrist to contact her.  She did and came and spoke to my mother.  Its the best thing to happen to my mum in years. Someone qualified to talk to.  Suffice it to say, when the GP found out he was FURIOUS and got very cross about my mum seeking help elsewhere ""you should have come to me first"" and all that rubbish, despite the fact she has been going to him for years and he never sorted out anyone for her to talk to.  Its taken my mum to have another breakdown and to actively seek help outside of her GP that has seen some progress in her care.  Its a fucking disgrace quite frankly.  Tablets are fine but they work best when used in conjunction with counselling of some sort.  My mum's local authority (in West Dorset) does provide services, just the GPs are like a firewall, not putting patients in contact with said services.  Either through trying to save money or pure ignorance.  But either way mental health services are VERY unsatisfactory, particularly when the person who needs the care is often in the worst position to actually fight for what they need as they are too busy being depressed and ill to do it.

While many people believe or wish to believe that Britain is now a classless meritocracy the statistics regarding social mobility indicate otherwise. As a result English people will judge each other on the exact word used to refer to an object e.g. Sofa/Couch/Settee, Napkin/Serviette, Lavatory/Loo/Toilet. As a foreigner you're excused from this initially but in the long term it's safer to use the middle class variant of all words (if you're a professional).

This also applies to the way people speak as shown by this quote from George Bernard Shaw (one of our great playwrights)

&gt;It is impossible for an Englishman to open his mouth without making some other Englishman despise him

**Weather**

As Paxman^1 explains it is not that British weather is particularly wild, it is that we have such a lot of it in such a short amount of time which makes it an excellent topic of conversation. However, Fox^2 maintains that the British use weather talk as a method of working around their natural dislike of small talk and a general sense of social dis-ease.

**Food**

One of the great things about the British is our ability to be conquered and then assimilate our conquerors and our ability to conquer others and nick everything we like. As a result our language has far more words than is strictly necessary and our national dish is a Chicken Tikka Massala accompanied by a Belgian influenced lager.

Mental health services are stretched, and they do need a triage system, but having GPs deliver that is wrong, it should be (at the minimum) trained mental health nurses.

There's a few things you can do: 

* Change her GP to someone with some training and understanding, and who is not an arse.

* Contact the community mental health team directly, [these are your local ones](http://www.dorsethealthcare.nhs.uk/services/adult-mental-health/community-mental-health-teams-nwd.htm). If you're in a crisis a nurse should call you back. Also make sure you get the other phone numbers you might need from them: The out of hours service and the crisis team.

* Contact a charity. [Rethink](http://www.rethink.org/) provide advocates that will advise, liaise, and fight your corner if necessary.  There's also [Mind](http://www.mind.org.uk/) who can offer similar services.

* In an emergency go to A&amp;E. This can be a hassle, waiting for the on-call psych consultant, but if you ask they'll probably give you a private room to wait in.

* The police. Not really needed in your mother's case. They can bring the patient to A&amp;E or an assessment unit annex of a psych ward (if one has been set up in the area).

check out [Child friendly brighton](http://www.childfriendlybrighton.co.uk/) it's not exhaustive but has some good tips and tricks and a schedule on what's on that day. 

[here](http://www.brighton-hove-rpml.org.uk/Museums/Pages/home.aspx) is the page for brighton and hove museums, they're not the best in terms of content but they are all run very well and the events are excellent. 

make sure you visit the [pavillion](http://www.brighton-hove-rpml.org.uk/RoyalPavilion/Pages/home.aspx) and maybe the [sealife centre](http://www.visitsealife.com/Brighton/) 

There are two [playgrounds](http://www.kidsinbrighton.co.uk/places_to_go/parks_and_playgrounds.html) along the seafront again this website is a great resource. may I recommend [Hove park](http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1250936) one of the biggest in Brighton and Hove and has very good facilities for children including a massive playpark for all ages,a brillaint rock climbing bolder and a lovely cafe again it gets busy but because of it's size never really stressful.

The beach is great fun to hang out on, the stretch between the two piers is mainly tourists and will be rammed if it is a hot day, if you head further into hove near the [king alfred sports centre](http://www.freedom-leisure.co.uk/centres.asp?section=657&amp;sectionTitle=king+alfred+leisure+centre), you'll find lovely less crowded kid friendly beaches (with sand at low tide) and IMO [brighton and hoves best ice cream](http://www.marroccos.co.uk/marroccos_ice_creams.html)

Brightons town centre has many restaurants including a raft of italians of various quality all are kid friendly, al duomos and donatellos are two of the bigger and OK ones. If you wish for something a bit nicer I recommend [Sams](http://www.samsofbrighton.co.uk/) family run, kid friendly dining, which has two sites; one in seven dials and one in [kemptown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemptown) (which is worth a potter around for antique/vintage type shops and lovely cafes and delis)

Lovely [rottingdean](http://www.childfriendlybrighton.co.uk/rock-pooling-at-rottingdean-beach) has great rockpools at low tide for scrambling around and finding crabs in with some good shops and pubs for the adults and great cream teas. 

Another spot worth a visit is the [seven sisters](http://www.sevensisters.org.uk/page4.html) and [cuckmere haven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckmere_Haven) which can be visited together and well worth it on a clear days for views etc.

other nearby towns and places worth considering are; [Lewes](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attractions-g186275-Activities-Lewes_East_Sussex_England.html), [Ashdown forest - home of pooh bear](http://www.just-pooh.com/ashdown.html) and [shoreham](http://www.shorehambysea.com/)

true,merdock379,lfc68,,"Not a horrible schedule, but not particularly favorable one either. The last 3 games against teams we should beat is maybe the highlight for me. If we are in a fight for 4th at that point, it should help. I don't see any reason we couldn't be, either. We were in the running for 3/4 of last season, till we lost that Arsenal game and fell apart. 

Two things I will need to see: the young guns in the cup matches and our starting 11 playing like a team possessed against lower table teams. If we deviate from that we'll be lucky to even make the EL next year. I know Rodgers would love to win hardware in his 1st year, but to be honest 3 trophies don't interest me at all. We*need* a top 4 finish and anything else is a failed season. People are saying he'll need time and I agree. But we hired someone relatively unproven and for me that doesn't change the goals. We need to make the CL this year. Sorry, but the pressure is on, none of this 2-3 years to put his system in place. Fuck that, make it happen this season. We don't have 2-3 years to wait. 

I still think given our situation, giving Rodgers the job at this point is starry-eyed optimism, and could prove to be a mistake. We should have hired a manager that has been proven at the top level to get us back to the CL, then his successor would be a Rodgers type to rebuild for the future. We wanted him because he would work well in the system we're trying to implement. Then all of a sudden he didn't agree to that system, so we just kind of tossed it out, rendering the initial want of Rodgers obsolete. It was kind of a poorly managed situation that no on seemed to notice. He'll need to shine this season to ward off the barrage of critiques headed his way if we do poorly. 

A lot of pressure and we shouldn't downplay it by thinking about years down the road. We've already failed this season if that is our mentality. ",0,1340036485,null,0,1340041241,0,c526o1i,t3_v7su9,t1_c526o1i,t3_v7su9,null,1429170648,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

The kind of ""residency permit"" she is applying for cannot actually be denied and is just there to make it easy for employers to check that she's allowed to work in the UK.

In theory, however, she is not required to apply for it to get granted the same rights you have as an EU citizen (unless you are from Romania or one of those Eastern European countries for which there are inexplicable exceptions). What this means is that, an employer who really wants to hire her will be happy if she brings your ID card (I'm assuming your passport is at the Home Office as well), your marriage certificate, and perhaps the acknowledgement letter if they're being anal. Studying the rights she has and being able to defend them in front of an interviewer is also a bonus.

Anyhow, the source for this is anecdotal: my (Canadian) wife was in a similar situation, except she already had a job but her previous visa (obtained before we got married or were legally considered civil partners) was running out. She had a bit of a chat with HR, who said ""That's good enough for us."". This was at a major nationwide chain, who was having other kinds of bad PR at the time and definitely didn't need an illegal alien employment story on top of it.

true,MrBushido2318,eu,European Union,"I know what he's saying, but those jobs don't exist. Going over his points in actual detail:

* Universal advanced healthcare: How will people move from a job in engineering to healthcare when the budget for healthcare is currently be torn to shreds by Tory idiots?
* Good education: My town is currently having a new school built to replace what was originally four separate sites when I was growing up in the area. So in that sense at least, there's money going around in education. Is there an issue in curriculum? In my opinion probably, at least at the University level. There are too many impractical degrees that aren't worth the paper they're written on once you graduate. That said, is that due to poor funding on the part of the education system or really an issue of free choice for white-collar worker?
* Good affordable transport. This isn't really part of the governments budget any more since both rail and road transport have been privatised. Leaving the only real option to improve the transit systems as subsidising them to provide a better service, the alternative being to buy out the companies or attempt to compete with them through new startups, which as you can imagine is an extremely expensive endeavour. So, ok, part of our £1B can be spent here, instead of a hundred skilled tradesmen and other professionals we now have more bus drivers.
* Fresh water: I'm 99% sure that any issue with water provisions are a deep concern for the government since it the utility service they are responsible for providing. Since I live in the north west where there is no water shortage that I'm aware of, I'm going to simply put this down to a problem the government are aware of and already have plans to ensure that supply meets demand. If there is a current shortfall for whatever reason that no doubt will also be being looked in to.
* Space Program: I'd love for this to be an option but frankly there's one issue, we're the UK. Coincidently this is related to your comment that we aren't that close to the equator. I'm not a rocket scientist, but it's my understanding that most space programmes are based near the equator due an increase in fuel costs launching shuttles from non-equatorial latitudes. An issue that increases with distance from the equator, making a UK launch fiscally infeasible.

true,Life_on_benefits,null,null,"&gt;Do you feel you get enough benefits? Too much? Too little?

I think I get just enough.

&gt;How do you feel about the fact you get more money per year than many people you (probably) know even though you don't work? How do they feel about it? Has it led to any strained relations with friends or anything?

Being disabled is a full time job, it's easy to think of the money disabled people receive as being tax free disposable income but let me explain. If someone does my shopping 2-3 times per week, that's 6+ hours of work someone has to do for me including transportation costs, I can't cook full meals for myself most days (washing, peeling, pans etc) so I either rely on food cooked by other people or I buy the more expensive healthier pre-made meals, the cost of this adds up. I need help around the house which I have to pay for, my gas , electric and phone bills cost a lot more than a typical single person as I am stuck in pretty much all day. If you remove what it costs me to be disabled I really don't have a lot of money left over.

&gt;How do you feel about the fact you get more money per year than many people you (probably) know even though you don't work?

If I was working now I would be earning more than I currently receive but it's not the money that concerns me, I'd rather be healthy.

&gt;How do they feel about it? 

I don't tell anyone, I can't do very much so I can't do anything to show how much money I receive.

&gt;Has it led to any strained relations with friends or anything?

I haven't seen my friends in months, and I haven't had a relationship in years, I think I'll probably die single.

If so, awesome. 

Best idea would be to get a hotel in the city center, some of them are pretty cheap.

And if you're only staying 1 or 2 nights I doubt you'd be bothered too much.

Getting to the ground is easy, London's underground system is clear as day and you can't get lost (especially not when the West Ham fans start coming on the trains).

Tickets: Check the fixture list and see what game you want.

Then put a big fat note on your desktop stating when tickets go on general sale (mind you, for the likes of ManU, Liverpool, Arsenal,...) chances are they'll never make general sale.

Simply make an account (if you don't have one yet) on the ticket office website and sit at the ready with your bank card.

You could choose to keep the tickets at the ground until you arrive and then pick them up on match day or the day(s) before.

As for the match-day itself: If you're interested in the stereotype thing, hope into the Boleyn Pub, singing songs with fat guys and getting beer over your clothes is free.

There's dozens of pubs in the area, just follow the crowd.

true,NeauxWai,tardis,TARDIS,"I think you should just start with s2e1. Tennant is a *fantastic* actor, and he delivers a much more nuanced performance than Smith, *in my opinion.* His classical training shines, and he really made me love Doctor Who.

I find Smith actually less interesting than Tennant because he operates primarily on two levels. There's big (like when he's excited, angry, giving epic monologues, etc.), and there's regular (like when he's serious or sad). It's kind of all or nothing with 11. **Which** may very well just be his character. I'm not trying to knock Smith as an actor, I really enjoy his take on the Doctor.

I think what I'm trying to say is that, for the actors who play the Doctor, bigger isn't necessarily better. Smith is a bit ""go big or go home"" a lot of the time. Tennant has many more levels in his performance. His sad is just absolutely heartbreaking. His angry is sometimes frightening. His scared actually made me cry.

You can be an 11th Doctor kind of guy, but, under that, still be a *Doctor* kind of guy. Watch Tennant, and power through Rose (I didn't like her while we had her, but I missed her when she was gone). I believe you'll be glad you did.

* Tottenham will drop 
* Carroll will hit beast mode
* Suarez will continue form 
* Lucas will be back running the mid
* Coates and Kelly will transition in and Carragher out
* Rodgers tika taka system will work
* Henderson and Downing will be immediately more relaxed and confident

Tatically:

* Our defence was pretty solid last season having conceived the third least amount of goals
* The mid failed on the wings, hopefully we can resolve this with the Tika Taka system easing attacks on the wing
* Carroll suffered at the start but I can see him getting going straight away
* If Suarez can get along with Carroll then Suarez can control the ground and Carroll can rule the skies 

Prediction:

1. Chelsea
2. Man City
3. Man Utd
4. Liverpool
5. Arsenal

What troubles me is the solution to that issue is to throw every person in the doner list. What becomes the focus then is when are people given the option to opt out?

* Fill a form out online
* When a patient is admitted to hospital they're given a form to ask them if they want to opt out of donating organs upon death
* Do we ask school children do they want to opt out of donating their organs when they die

1.  Many work from home jobs aren't work at home jobs. You need transport and you need to go to places and deal with people at particular times. I can't drive, I can't cope with people and I can't maintain a fixed daily schedule.

2.  Many work at home jobs are telephone support jobs. Again, I can't deal with people and I can't maintain a fixed daily schedule.

3.  *Hugely* many work at home jobs are scams. Basically, the ""worker"" ends up as a customer, buying equipment and services at inflated prices that are supposed to enable them to earn money from opportunities that don't exist. And since they are buying for ""business"" purposes, they don't have consumer rights - no right to demand a refund when the goods and services aren't fit for purpose etc.

4.  I'm convinced that work-at-home data entry jobs are either telephone based, or else mythical. If you already have printed data, there are cheaper and faster ways to get it into a computer than to post it to someone who lives in the first world and wait for them to type it.

In fact, since the only work I was ever good at was programming, the obvious fantasy solution was to work at home as a programmer, developing my own software on my own schedule. There's lots of reasons why this hasn't worked out.

There are freelance programming sites like [Guru](http://www.guru.com/), but most of the jobs either (1) require a skillset I can't acquire because I can't afford the software to work with, or (2) are incredibly badly specified, so I'd need extremely good people skills to deal with the client and resolve all the questions that very likely they haven't answered because they don't know anyway, and (3) are snapped up by developers in India who see a few pence per hour as a vast fortune, and won't end up paying even more than they earn for their electric bill and other costs.

It has been said of Northampton that growing up there has a major advantage: one really wants to go and see everything else.

Despite being bigger than many cities, it still has a small town mentality.

There is a thriving sub-culture, but be prepared to either ignore it or to be heckled as you walk down the streets.

In summary, Northampton is dull and violent, with little to speak of in terms of culture.

It is, however, cheaper than the other places and you get get to London and Birmingham by train in a little over an hour from the station.

true,PTRJK,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"Do you have any aspirations despite what your going through? And can you think of a better system we could implement/take away that might be more helpful to you or other people like you?

  I was thinking about *maybe* (apart from the disabled such as yourself) scrapping the idea of benefits completely. Do you think it would be a good idea if instead; people could apply for state funded work? i don’t mean working for private companies and taking real jobs. But simply going to a council building or phone/online and picking a selection of whatever jobs they have to offer and work with a team of others to complete it by a deadline. People could learn a few things, stay active and contribute something back (it could also do wonders for some people's self-respect and respect from/for others). The pay would be minimal but also as they are working anyway, it would be an incentive to find a better paying and more reliable job instead of the system we currently have of ‘making work pay’ in which we pay benefit on top of their wage.

  It would be simply viewed as guaranteed public sector jobs and it doesn’t matter about the education/experience you have although obviously some jobs might be slightly more suiting to your ability.

  Also I don’t know what system we have with disability benefit but how i think it should be handled is privately between you, a support worker (who ever handles the money from the state to you) and your doctor. You could have meet-ups, even at your own home every couple of months if needed and discuss with you your unique medical &amp; financial problems about what you need and what steps you can take to get better? So the money and support is completely and confidentially tailored to you. (Or has this already implemented?)


  There are gaps in this that might need explaining but do you and does anyone else think the concept is any good? 

**Edit**: Just in case there's confusion about the first idea, as long as your unemployed you can apply for a job that can take week, month or a day to do and be payed on that job to job basis.

true,doogieduck,null,null,"Given the tough start we have and the transition to Rodgers style of football we are in for a nightmarish start. Rodger's teams have always started seasons poorly; Watford won only two of their first ten league games, and were in the relegation zone by January, 1 win in first 5 games with Swansea last season. 

However, eventually I believe he will succeed in implementing his tiki-taka as we are certainly capable or producing technical football with players like Suarez Gerrard Lucas Agger Johnson, even Reina in goal is suited to it, playing as a sweeper keeper. The signing of Siggurrdson will help but I have a feeling much of our success depends on our efficiency in front of goal. Rodgers teams don't concede many, and he has talked about creating high quality chances, ones that we must be able to take.

I think Arsenal will suffer this coming season as RVP had an incredible campaign that he won't achieve again at his age and given the summer he has had (he is due an injury too). However, the imminent signing of Giroud may soften the blow, but then will RVP leave. If they sign M'Vila I can see them finishing in the top 4 as he can give them the solidity they need in the gritty games.

Tottenham may yet lose Modric and therefore their best player and much depends on who they appoint as manager. They desperately need a striker and they then still have the core team that saw them flying high last season until February. If they lose Modric, they lose their hopes of top 4.

Newcastle had a fluke of a season in my eyes, Cabaye Tiote and Ba carried the side until Cisse and Ben Arfa came in. They scored the most goals in the league from outside the box and generally rode their luck. They won't be challenging for the top 4.

Chelsea will, unfortunately, challenge for the title. I am predicting a slight fall for United since teams are finally trying to take them on. They usually start the season badly, last season the exception, that could see them fall behind City.

We need a few good signings, who fit the philosophy, and some overdue luck in the league to finish in the top 4. Hopefully Tottenham, Newcastle and Arsenal aren't as successful in the transfer market this season and we could pinch it.

Anyway, my question; There has been a lot of talk of late regarding the agency Remploy who (as far as I understand) exist to find work for disabled people, and support them in development in said role. 

I understand that this agency operates a business model whereby they run factories or assembly lines and such like which employ, in the majority, disabled persons. There has been a shift in their practice of late that is intending to shut down a number of these centres, to instead focus their efforts on integrating disabled workers into more common place work, as opposed to running this high-cost loss-leader type businesses. In theory, this would enable more support for more individuals.

I wondered what you think about this agency and this move in general, if of course this is familiar to you!

**Dzeko** - Only if he really is unhappy with his playing time, I thought he had pretty good season, especially compared to his first six months. But  with Aguero, Balo and Tevez, if he's in the mood, fighting for minutes I can't seem him getting many more than this season. Also I think we can be a little harsh on him and that effects how he plays, he misses us singing his name as much as we used to.

**Kolarov** - I love his crosses and free kicks, but we're covered with Clichy and Zaba can play on the left as well. It would be nice for him to stay and rotate, but I think [here](http://fedenerazzurra.com/2012/06/15/inter-met-kolarovs-agent-would-like-wage-reduced/) says he is on almost 6m euros a year.",0,1340067387,null,0,false,0,c52e0iv,t3_v8lkb,t1_c52e0iv,t3_v8lkb,null,1429174173,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

- **Edin Dzeko**. I like the guy, but his talent isn't immense like Tevez' and Aguero's. Balo is younger (and more entertaining). Should be sold to Bayern, Juve or some top club from another country.
- Maybe **Gareth Barry** or **Adam Johnson**. I really rate Johnson, but he's not getting the time he deserves. Barry is a good player but your midfield is just stacked and he's probably on a big contract since he was persuaded back in 2009.

true,30percentAlpaca,k9,K-9,"My friend was wondering what's the best love story of all time. I told her the Doctor and River.  

Alright, perhaps it's not; I certainly haven't come across every love story ever written, and I don't think I'd enjoy that anyway. But the realization that River had when the Doctor met her for the first time - that he knew all along that this was how she dies - that is so sad.  

For the most part, *we*, the viewers, are sad when we think about River's death, but imagine being the Doctor. He knows that he is going to fall in love with someone whom he has already watched die for his sake. Could he really not see that every time he sees her? It's in his past, yet it is also in his future - one day he will make good on his promise to bring River to see the Singing Towers of Darilium and give her his sonic screwdriver.  

He could not save her from her death, because she forbid it, knowing that doing so meant she would never have  existed. They could not escape River ""killing"" him, because it was a fixed point in time, and that landed her in prison. Even though she has every capability to do so, she would never simply just leave the prison to be with him, because doing so would instigate a manhunt on her, and eventually reveal to the universe (and the Silence) that he is alive, and she would never do anything to put the Doctor in danger.
