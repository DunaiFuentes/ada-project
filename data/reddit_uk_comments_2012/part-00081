We elect leaders into power because, yes, we believe that their ideas may be what it takes to help the country, and the people out, and improve the quality of life for everyone in the country. However, should their plan to do so reek of absolute shit once they start implementing it, whether that be two years, or three years down the line, then they, in my opinion, are free to change that plan to better suit the needs of the people.


Hypothetically, imagine in the global economy right now, there was a massive demand for peanuts, and we, the United Kingdom, had a humongous area of land amazingly well suited to growing peanuts, and if we were to harvest said peanuts, we'd be the richest nation on Earth. Candidate 1, we'll call him Nigel, before election says, ""haha, peanuts, why waste our time on peanuts, they'll not be high demand soon. My five year plan involves no peanuts at all."" Instead, candidate 2, Morris,  says, ""We should definitely flip this country upside down and turn as much available space into peanut farms, so we can reap the rewards!"" - Now, happily we all agree with Morris, and elect him. For a year, the masses of peanut farms boosts our economy sky high, and we're rolling in money, but all of a sudden the world market for peanuts plummet, and we're making no money, we are spending pointless cash on peanut farmer wages, and in the process we go into economic decline.



Given the above simplified scenario, what should the elected candidate and his party opt to do?


A) Take your stance, and stick to his guns, never changing his plans, and continue producing peanuts, despite a large, public outcry to stop, because it's slowly ruining the country, or...

B) The candidate changes his five year plan, and opt for one that isn't so peanut heavy.

And as far as ""it's just pain."" I'm glad you are content sitting it out, but I am not. I like to hike. I live in a big city and I'd much rather walk or bike places. Sitting it out isn't an option for me. I wont let a bad knee slow me down. But let me ask you, would you be just as sickened if I took the vicoden I was originally prescribed by my doctor for my pain infringement of you? Because it's legal despite the fact it is highly addictive and would destroy my kidneys over time?

Or perhaps the sleepy time tea I use fall asleep with heat activated thc oil is much worse than prescription sleep aids that made me trip balls and sleep walk.

true,ohnoitsjameso,null,null,"I don't mind river song as a character because I like the idea of two time travelers going in opposite directions.it's atleast different then his traditional companions. I am however not a big fan of the actress herself and the melody pond inception. 

But the thing is, River is THE main point to Smith's story and was sort of obvious that they would spend a lot of time on her from Silence in the Library. 10 said that she knew his name, and had a sonic she said he gave to her - this is a HUGE deal, and would have been silly if they didn't fully explore that story line. 

And the reason they aren't spending more time on the time lords is you can't do to much with that story without getting deeper into the time war, which is going to be tricky to do while serving it justice. The time war is a legend that has lasted for 6 seasons, and we have only been given a few glimpses here in there about it. I'd hate for them to rush it and fuck it up.

The problem I have with the Smith seasons is that I just didn't buy the whole pandorica escape, and while I did see River as the astronaut coming, I didn't like how they cleaned up the story either.



I guess you could say so far they had great ideas, just not great execution. But I expect season 7 to be FANTASTIC, because as the doctor gets closer to death, it will probably get darker and darker.

true,racergr,null,null,"Hello fellow Greek. Here are some tips:

IQ is too far, unless if you get a bicycle or something (you get a good used one for max £150), cycling in Edinburgh is relatively save but you'll have to learn the etiquette. However, the bicycle does not protect you from the elements and there is no easy bus service from IQ to the Informatics building.

Since you only have four days, I would suggest to find a flat share in a big flat with lots of people (3-4 or more). This is not very different than a halls of residence. Also, it is cheaper (max £400/month inc bills) and if you make sure that you do a short contract (i.e. 3 months) then you can leave at any time if you don't like your flatmates. It is likely that there is not even a contract involved, just a verbal agreement.

Try posting on the [Edinburgh Hellenic Society](https://www.facebook.com/groups/157357047615918/) Facebook group and ask if somebody has a room to let. You might get lucky.

Renting a small flat on your own is probably not a good option for you (too expensive, you meet no new people, 4 days is not enough time to do so).

But they can only afford to pay Network Rail 50% of its cost, so NR has to get the rest from government. The plan is to continually raise the fare price until the train operators can cover all of NRs costs, while simultaneously getting NR to make efficiency improvements. There is so much waste in the system. I'd imagine every fare is paying for the profits of multiple companies all taking their slice out of it before it gets spent on infrastructure.

There are plenty of stories on it. Here's one for example;

&gt; http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jun/09/network-rail-profits-up-punctuality-down

&gt; Last year Network Rail received a £3.7bn grant from the government, with the lion's share of its remaining income coming from train operators, who paid £2bn, helped by above-inflation fare income from passengers.

Another:

&gt; http://fullfact.org/factchecks/taxpayer_subsidy_train_network_nationalisation-3391

&gt; Christian Wolmar is definitely right to point out that the level of taxpayer subsidy to the rail network currently stands at several times the real terms equivalent before privatisation. Indeed the figures show that in some years, Network Rail has received more money from taxpayers than from passengers post-privatisation.

&gt; However the current level of Government investment in the railways may owe much to the ongoing fallout from privatisation, in particular the collapse of Railtrack in 2002, which in turn may mean that subsidies could fall back in the future.

true,scraggz111,eng-sussex,Sussex,"I actually worked out that it's cheaper to buy a moped (£200) get a CBT (£90), tax(£16(/12x9=£12)), MOT(£25(/12x9=18.75)) and insure(~£130(/12x9=97.5)) it than it is to get the train (£161.30) to college. 

The train pass is only valid for three months at a time (x 3 = £483.90) whereas the CBT is valid for two years(£90/24x9=£33.75). Factoring in petrol, my weekly commute is 46.2 miles or 83.16km at an average of 131.9p per litre with an average mpg of 100. (2.8 l/100km or 2.33 l/83.16km = 307.33p or £3.07 per week x 36) = £110.52 per 9 months. 

So the whole cost is 12 + 18.75 + 33.75 + 97.50 + 110.52 + 200= £472.52 over a 9 month period. Minus the cost of the moped = £272.52, that's nearly half the cost.

The Government is all like go green, use public transport, blah blah blah, but if it's double the cost what's the point. Make public transport cheap then it might happen but when I can barley afford lunch some days, how am I meant to afford the train!?

true,ringo_scar,null,null,"In answer to your first point (but not your main point): After having spent some time in Japan, I realise the massive benefit of having cheaper tickets if you are prepared to state in advance when you will travel.

In Japan, there is a flat rate for train tickets, which somewhat exceeds the 'on the day' fare in the UK. This means a 2 hour (admittedly luxurious) train journey can cost in excess of £250, even if you know months in advance exactly when you will travel.

The UK system provides a form of social levelling, in that people who are time rich but cash poor can, in general, pay less for train tickets. People who are always travelling on the 'spur of the moment' (think buisnesspeople and other richer members of society) will end up paying more, but they get flexibility for their money. In addition, it helps ensure off-peak trains are fuller and peak trains are less full.

I agree that the resources are the same, but in a way the pricing structure (at least in the UK) seems to be done on more of a supply and demand system (trying to make sure trains are not too empty or too full), with a dose of economic levelling on top. In my mind this makes sense in a system where the trains will run regardless.

true,ConstableOdo,null,null,"Well. I am college age and most the heavy pot smokers I know are college age, though none of them have gone to college. I think all drug users hurt society to some degree, from pot smokers to krokodil (Spelling?) users. They all contribute some sort of detriment and it extends past their own lives. 

From my observations, Marijuana is a gateway drug not in that is makes people seek a different or stronger high but because marijuana and other drugs can often be obtained in the same place. It puts people in situations where they simultaneously have bad options available and impaired decision making skills. 

I walk so far as is reasonable (country so really I can't get any real place walking, so I mostly walk on the hills and in the woods. Not worth walking four miles just to get milk or some other things). I would bike if I had any sense of balance. I go to a gym regularly. 

I would be if you were taking enough to alter your state of mind. My dad was on percocet for a great while because of crushed ribs and he never experienced an altered state of mind. There are always other drugs out there and people can keep their mental processes. 

He also never got addicted to it. I wonder about people who do get addicted to prescription medication because it's a small percentage of those who take it. I've known people who have been prescribed almost everything. Funny enough, my brother got addicted to pain medication prescribed for a broken arm he never had. 

There are other sleep aids. Muscle relaxers work just as well as sleep inducers for some people. Perhaps that in combination with something else would work. 

You make it sound like it's heavenly pot or devilish pills when really there is a whole gamut of things in between. I am not convinced pot in the safe magic plant everything thinks it is because I can see damage in the lives of people who use it. 

Also, why do people who do pot always bring up having tried it. I also haven't tried sex but I am 100% sure it doesn't interest me. I don't have to try something to make a decision on it.

The problem is trains are far too expensive to be a viable option. I can't really see a reason why they should be but, I guess they are just run badly or, the government is charging too much for the use of the infrastructure. 

It's the same in other places. I had to travel from Geneva to London a couple of years ago. It was half the price (and half the time) to take the plane (even after you factor in all the stupid extra costs of flying like time/cost of getting to the airport). It was also true that it was cheaper to fly to Paris from Geneva than take the train despite the TGV being much better value than Eurostar (and much easier, no 'check in time' even though it was from outside the EU to inside it before Schengen).

•Rory wasn’t surprised that the TARDIS was bigger on the inside, and all other companions were.

I would say to this two things...One: We don't actually see him enter the TARDIS...or even at least the 20-60 (at least) seconds after that. Both Rose and Martha (to name the two companion entrances I remember the most) got over it fairly quickly, as well as a fair few of 11s ""guests"". Two: He did seem still a tad surprised at it.

 •Rory didn’t have a room in the God Complex

Of course...they all probably had rooms...doesn't mean they all found them. Also....all the others were human except two. They all had rooms. The two non-humans...wait...They had rooms too! So what's the correlation between Rory being the Master (A Time Lord) not having a room when The Doctor (a Time Lord) had a room?

 •Rory complains of hearing a banging in his head in Let’s Kill Hitler

The Master's sounds were drumbeat or knocking. Besides...have you never had a headache that feels like banging? I have.

 •Rory keeps dying and returning

He had good reasons. So does The Doctor (who doesn't properly DIE but has gone for a few moments a few times) and Jack. Why don't we all go JACK IS THE MASTER!

 •River carries Time Lord DNA

I thought this was properly explained in the episode? Enough said tbh.

 •The date on Rory’s ID

We have no idea about this one but we DO know that he was a kid and grew at the same rate as Melody and Amy. Not yet seen a Time Lord regress into a Child.

•Rory has been growing increasingly violent

That'll be when evil people steal his wife and baby. I'm fairly sure that would annoy me too? I don't recall seeing him violent in The Girl Who Waited or God Complex or any of those sorts of episodes. In fact...Amy was more violent in Wedding than he was. As for hitting Hitler...I'm sure ANYONE would if they got a chance.

 •We never see a future Rory, but we see future Amy.

When do we see a future Amy? Oh..yeah....In The Girl Who Waited. Basically the plot of the ENTIRE story means that we couldn't see a future Rory. Why does this make a big deal?

 •The Immortality Gate creates a spark that looks like the crack in Amy’s wall.

Who went through these bits frame by frame to find this? Does screenshot evidence (with timestamp would be nice) exist?

 •Rory is passionate like the Master and both are afraid to be alone.

""Passionate"" basically describes pretty much every single companion. ""Afraid to be alone"" describes a lot of people too. Though I fail to see how these two change anything? And where these came from?

 •We know Amy has parents. What about Rory?

Obviously not watched The Big Bang. Rory's parents were there. In fact...his mother said to Amy: ""Your father will be the absolute death of me, unless I strike pre-emptively"" (as a joke...obviously).

It's almost always ultimately about power, people don't acquire extreme amounts of wealth merely to consume, even when it begins that way.  Even for those who claim no interest in politics, and suggest they employ their wealth in non abusive ways, it's almost impossible to conceive of a person who would acquire more wealth than is necessary for their and their family's security without any regard to power.",0,1341075229,null,0,false,0,c57q6a1,t3_vu6q0,t1_c57q6a1,t1_c57pfc5,null,1429267019,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

First of all there's the slippery slope argument. So they've blocked the pirate bay. But what about other websites. Radical islam websites maybe? Which may trickle down to moderate muslim websites. Then eventually it'll be all religious expression. Or what about groups like the BNP. I bet if you asked the public if the BNP website should be blocked, a majority would say yes. And at what point are we curtailing political freedom when the party in power decides what we can and can't see. 

And at what point are we no better than those other countries? In my view, the moment we block ANYTHING, we are as bad as them. Because once that door is opened, there's no going back. The block list will only grow and spread to new areas.

Secondly, the UAE blocks porn mostly, because they deem it offensive to the Islamist policies. Thailand blocks anything about their royal family because they are very protective. China blocks political expression because they are ""communist"". But the UK.. we block a piracy website because some rich Hollywood lawyers from America demanded it. In many ways, I actually find that worse than doing it for religious or politican reasons. It means that our rights can be literally bought and sold, if you have enough money and apply enough political pressure.

Not to mention how many people will be THRILLED with the new pirate bay block. Record companies, movie industry etc will be foaming at the mouth to add more and more websites to the block list. That list is only going to get bigger and bigger and eventually we will only see what ""they"" want us to see.

Hell, what about reddit? I'm sure that most pictures, videos etc posted here are copyright. And there's definitely a lot of insentive things, porn, racism and trolling too. There was already controversy over jailbait subreddits etc.

Davis's DW focused more on the relationships between Doctor and Companions on a personal level. The Doctor was an alien, but his humanity was the primary focus. There was lots of hug-hug-kiss-kiss. The episodes were often silly but memorable and just a little bit sexy, with the focus not on story arcs but on individual episodes. The horror elements came from an unearthly realm of fear full of neon colours, extremes and sci-fi 'What ifs?' .

With Moffat, the focus seems to be more on the mythology of the Doctor. The Doctor is alien, and his interactions with humans only highlights it. The serials tend to focus on larger story arcs, with individual episodes contributing more to the mystery of what's going to happen next. The character relationships happen slightly more in the background with a little less hug-hug-kiss-kiss. The horror element is more subdued, more based on basic human emotion. There's sexiness, but it's played more for laughs.

To be fair to AVB, it wasn't him alienating the players so much as the players alienating him. If Abrahmovic allowed him full control and didn't continuously meddle Chelsea would have changed. Chelsea may have won the CL but the fact that they're just continuing down the same road theyve been on isn't good in the long run. AVB was going to build a new team and ethos that would last a decade, and now Chelsea only has the same team they had before. A team that plays hard defense cannot be successfully changed to an open attacking team that plays a high line overnight, the whole mentality of the team and all the players must change first. 

Under AVB they probably wouldn't have won the CL this year, but who's to say they wouldn't, in a few years time, be dominant in the PL again but with younger players playing attractive attacking football? 

Changes like the ones AVB tried to implement take a long time, and even longer when you're trying to change the way a team plays. Spurs already play a similar game to what AVB wants so we're already a good part of the way there.

However, with that said, the point of companions in the first place was sex appeal. I'm serious, and early on they didn't even hide it. Watch the very first episode of Doctor Who. When Susan is introduced, the camera does a full tilt for a good 5-7 seconds to show off her body.

I disagree. What about child pornography? The UK government makes ISPs block all sites on the Internet Watch Foundation's watchlist of sites/services distributing (hosting or linking to) child porn. Do you oppose this? 

Let's set up a hypothetical scenario: country A has decided to legalise possession and distribution of child porn, meaning many sites dedicated to distributing CP are set up, all hosted within, and obeying the laws of, country A. What should the UK do if such a scenario presented itself? Should we block these sites, or do nothing and allow British citizens to access them freely, albeit in violation of UK law? 

I can think of many situations where site-blocking would be an appropriate response.

&gt; But the UK.. we block a piracy website because some rich Hollywood lawyers from America demanded it. 

The site is blocked because the High Court ruled it was necessary, and the Digital Economy Act allows sites to be blocked for reasons pertaining to copyright. There is a strong copyright lobby in the UK and they desperately want pirate sites blocked - I disagree with this, but that doesn't mean *all* instances of site-blocking are appropriate or unnecessary, and it doesn't mean we're on par with countries implementing widespread blocking of political content, IMHO.

There's no reason we can't block certain groups of sites and leave it at that. It's not necessarily true that it will lead to any other content being blocked.

I think the blocking of the Pirate Bay puts us on a slippery slope, (the industry is probably going to want more pirate sites blocked), but one that leads to more blocking of only sites in the pirate/warez category; I don't think we're ever going to wake up and find we can't access sites deemed politically dangerous.",0,1341085216,null,0,false,0,c57s36m,t3_vtee1,t1_c57s36m,t1_c57rsjd,null,1429267927,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

However the car will be the most expensive. The £30 a day extra is also on top of finding a parking space and paying for those also.

There is a perceived threat of terrorism, whether that is true is not is largely irrelevant - clearly the powers that be are wary of someone trying something. Not so long ago civil aircraft were flown into large buildings in New York City.

As a means of defending against a similar incident in London during the Olympics, the powers that be would like surface to air missiles available to them. In such a dense urban area the best place for these launchers is on top of buildings, in this case blocks of flats.

Their being there does not make the flats a target, it's just a suitable place to site such equipment.  There will no doubt be similar equipment placed near other high value targets such as Heathrow. 

Now I'm not convinced that such a credible threat actually exists, and basically what this comes down to is people objecting to what they see as the government flexing its military muscle in the name of the war on terror, which many of us believe to be overblown bullshit but if, for the sake of a few squaddies sitting on your roof, this keeps the intelligence peoples paranoia at bay then so be it.  These launchers may not even be very effective at shooting down planes especially over a city like London but would still serve a deterrent role quite nicely.

The easiest way to keep the cost down is to not travel too far! You're in a good position to focus on East Anglia. Colchester is a major piece of Roman history, with a well-preserved castle, definitely deserving of a day trip.

Just a little north from there is [Dedham Vale](http://www.dedhamvalestourvalley.org/index.asp), aka [Constable Country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Constable). Either get a bus from Colchester to Flatford, or train to Manningtree and take a walk down the valley.

Much of the coast from north Essex right around to Norfolk is beautiful, although not all of it is easily accessible by train or regular buses. The Essex coast of the Stour east of Colchester is OK by train, being on the Harwich line.

Exploring up the east of Suffolk is a good idea, too. Woodbridge is a lovely and popular town (and is where I come from :) ), and is on the train line. [Orford Ness](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/orford-ness/) is unique and very special, but would involve a taxi to get there. However, depending on how many people are involved, you might not find that an unreasonable way to get from the train to various places, and if so then Southwold and Aldeburgh are towns worth a visit for their very English seaside nature (in a way far removed from tacky Southend!)

true,animorph,null,null,"Hi there!

Please don't take this personally, but this topic gets brought up a lot in this subreddit. In my opinion it is grossly unfair towards Amy and doesn't fully appreciate or recognise what she went through.

The following is a copy and paste that I've written in response to these posts:

It is not simply a case of 36 years v. 2000 years, in this respect, numbers actually mean very little. Firstly, Amy is left behind through no choice or fault of her own. In comparison, Rory chose to wait as a penance for killing Amy, he wanted to protect her, yes, but when you consider the Pandorica is meant to hold the Doctor, it’s probably pretty secure.

Amy is left in isolation for those 36 years with no human or alien contact, with daily battles to stay alive. She changed enormously during those years, how many times must she have had depressive moments in which she considers giving up and letting the handbots put her to sleep? But no, every day she fought to live – 13140 days of fighting.

In comparison, yes, Rory fought to protect the Pandorica. But it was not every day, he was not under constant threat for his life. He was able to protect the Pandorica simply by being there as a presence and even just persuading people to leave it alone. Furthermore, during his time he was able to socialise with other people, he travelled the world, he fought alongside historical figures, he had a *life* that did not revolve around just staying alive.

Rory knew what would happen at the end of his waiting – he'd already seen the Doctor in his fez, he knew Amy survived, heck, in a way he even knew he would survive. Amy however didn't, she was stuck waiting for the Doctor who has already continually abandoned her (and abandonment as a child is a difficult thing to forget). She didn't know what would happen and whether she would ever see Rory again. When Young Amy sees Future Amy, you can see the memories start to form, Time is rarely circular in the Whoniverse, and we cannot assume that Future Amy actually previously experienced that conversation.

Ageing: Amy aged. She grew old without the husband she loves and is suddenly confronted him in his young glory. The embarrassment, shame and anger she must be feeling towards the Doctor depriving them of the best years of her life. And she is angry at the Doctor – not Rory – because he hides away in his TARDIS and doesn't face what has happened.

Rory however didn't age. Yes, there was a threat of death and not healing, but the passage of time was never an issue. He knew he would be physically young when Amy awoke, and in a sense it didn't matter because his goal was the future, it was to waste time.

Furthermore, the fact that these posts suggest that Rory would say such a thing to Amy is abhorrently out of character for him. He would *never* revel in Amy’s misery, or try to compete in a ""who suffered the most"" competition. If you don’t like Amy, fine, whatever, but using this episode to accuse her of being a unappreciative is, in my opinion, woefully ignorant of both their experiences.

(And in specific response to you): Of course Amy thanked him, she was so happy at seeing him again. Both of them were, because they are a partnership very much in love with each other.",0,1341091858,null,0,false,0,c57tcc4,t3_vurxz,t1_c57tcc4,t3_vurxz,null,1429268513,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

""I wish he wouldn't go to present day London that much."" As pointed out previously, it was Tennant that spent most of his time in London. Between series 5 and 6 the Doctor has only been to London, in any time period, a maximum of 5 times.

""I hate that it's all about Amy now"" The show has always been just as much about the companions as it has been about the Doctor. Besides, there's probably less focus on Amy than any of the companions in series 1-4 because her family isn't brought up much.

""Is the Doctor trying to be a hipster?"" The TARDIS console for 9 and 10 was also covered in random levers and switches. If anything the new console looks more like the classic one than the previous console room, it brings back the hexagonal console and more traditional-looking roundels, and gets rid of the random coral pillars.

""Every episode in series 6 is tied in with that"" The classic series was full of reoccuring themes. The 3rd Doctor's exile to Earth, the 4th Doctor and the key to time, the 6th Doctor's Trial of a Time Lord? And what about the whole Bad Wolf thing leading up to the end of Series 1, The constant mentions of vanishing planets leading up to the return of Davros in Series 3, and YANA and the Vote Saxon campaign leading up to the return of the Master in series 4?

I'm not saying you aren't entitled to your opinions, but it seems you're just making up reasons to hate Moffat's seasons out of the blue, for no reason other than to just say you hate his seasons.

Unfortunately you are quite right about the nutter with a backpack front. MI5, MI6, GCHQ &amp; The Met is the defence against that. Unless it is a lone bomber situation coming from nowhere then it is fucked.

Edit:
From wikipedia about the air defence : 

""Advanced air defence
The Type 45 design uses the Principal Anti-Air Missile System, now known in Royal Navy service as Sea Viper. It is a joint British, French and Italian design. PAAMS consists of a SAMPSON fire control and tracking radar, MBDA Aster 15 and 30 missile systems and a 48-cell SYLVER vertical missile launcher, giving both short-range and long-range anti-air capability. The PAAMS system is able to control and coordinate several missiles in the air at once, allowing several tracks to be intercepted. The SYLVER VLS missile launcher can be upgraded to accommodate other weapons if necessary. The Daring class have often been considered to be the most powerful air-defence warships in the world.[23] It has been suggested that the SAMPSON radar is capable of tracking an object the size of a cricket ball travelling at three times the speed of sound""

true,emericuh,lfcflame,,"1984 FA Cup Final Replay at Maine Road was my first match, which I am guessing puts me in contention for the oldest supporter here.

I was five years old and although my father was a season ticket holder, he hadn't taken me to a game, as my family didn't have much money. He wasn't able to get tickets for the first tie, which ended 0-0 (thanks to an Alan Hansen handball on the goal line that wasn't given a penalty!). 

A family friend had bought tickets for the replay, but ended falling ill the night before and couldn't go. He offered the tickets to my dad and I remember hearing my mother (an Evertonian!) from the other room insisting that if he were to go, he had to take me. Thanks, Mum!

We won the match thanks to a first half goal from Graeme Souness in what was otherwise a pretty shitty match. Not that it mattered. To be honest, I don't remember much of the match apart from the goal and the final whistle, but I was hooked from that moment on. I begged my father to get me a season ticket the next year and, somehow, they scraped together the money to make it happen. For the next 13 years, we went to almost every home game together and loads of away matches, too.

I moved away from the UK almost 10 years ago and Dad retired in 2008 after a heart attack. He's still around and as Red as ever, but three years ago I called him and told him from here on out, *I* bought his season ticket. He goes to every game and his ritual is exactly the same.  

Regardless of what is going on in my life, he calls me on the way home from every match and we talk about the game. Last year I was working late on a project at my office and watching a midweek game on the internet. After the match I got wrapped up in what I was doing and hadn't noticed that he hadn't called. It was almost midnight when I realized that I hadn't heard from him, which has never happened before. Fearing the worse, I called his mobile, but there was no answer. At this point, I could feel my heart racing and my hands were shaking as I dialed my parent's house number. My father, very much asleep and annoyed, answered the phone with a grunt.

""Dad, why didn't you call me after the game? I was looking forward to hearing what you thought about the match.""

""Eh, I couldn't find my phone on me and it was late.""

""Well, you should have called when you got home, you know I don't mind. I was really worried to be honest. You always call.""

""Look 'ere, Nosy Parker, I dropped my phone in the fucking loo and didn't want to tell her. The last thing I need is her on my tits about breaking another phone."" He loses or breaks about three a year.

There was a long, awkward silence on the line before I blurted out something we never say to one another, ""I love you, Dad.""

Another pause.

""Alright, then. I'll call you when I get a new phone.""",0,1341094115,null,0,false,0,c57trxq,t3_vuhx0,t1_c57trxq,t3_vuhx0,null,1429268716,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

If your analogy held up, the current government would surely be dropping all its cuts programmes as they are having the exact opposite affect than they are supposed to.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"Believe it or not, I 100% agree with you. Every actor brings their own twists, spins, emotions, and general attitude into The Doctor. On an analytical level, it's very interesting to see how everyone plays the exact same part. It's like they were all given the exact same 'paint by colors' drawing, but got to paint it however they saw fit.

That being said, the problem occurs when people begin to treat every incarnation as though it is a separate and unique character, as with the original image. Saying things like 11 'murdered' 10, or that he was responsible for his death. It comes off as a bit of a ridiculous notion that 11 was responsible for 10 leaving when they're, in theory, the same exact character.

And I have no problem with people having favorites. There's a reason why my icon is 8, because I love him. Paul McGann will always have a special place in my heart as The Doctor. However, I never push onto people my opinion of the 8th Doctor. That's where things really start crossing the line. Too many times, even here on /r/doctorwho, I see people talk about how David Tennant is the best version of The Doctor, how much better he is than Matt Smith, and if you believe otherwise then you're just wrong. This, to me, is crossing the line. 

When asked 'Which is your favorite Doctor' there should never be a wrong answer, period. They're all interpretations of the same character. You are allowed to your opinion on which one you like best, but it by no means makes it the only proper interpretation. Going along with your own analogy, you are free to believe that a Harley best suits The Doctor. However, that doesn't entitle you to throw eggs at The Doctor when he hops onto a Vespa, or say that he has no business riding a Vespa in the first place.

And, at the end of the day, everyone should keep in mind that Bessie came *way* before the Harley and Vespa.",0,1341100100,null,0,false,0,c57uyf0,t3_vuo04,t1_c57uyf0,t1_c57u5y5,null,1429269273,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4
