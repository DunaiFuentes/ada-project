true,thanksfc,lfc68,,"Yeah, remember when Edin Dzeko didn't do anything all last season, and how he started this season? On top of that, Carroll is younger. He also signed with us when he was dealing with a big injury, and he hasn't had a good run of games even since returning from injury. 

Enrique is great, I think Hendo was an amazing buy, and he looks better every game. Adam has had some ups, but mostly some iffy performances. You can't fault his work rate, although his set pieces, shooting, and passing have all taken a dip in form the past two months. Downing is okay, but definitely overpriced and the only regrettable purchase in my decision. Especially considering Carroll's fee was paid by Chelski. 

Were you happy with the win against Man City? Thank Dalglish and Clarke for that one, as their tactics worked a treat that night. Henderson and Gerrard helping carry out that plan is what made it all work. Henderson may not be anywhere near a prolific goal scorer, he shows glimpses of brilliance now and again, but thanks to these run of starting XI games he's had he's only getting better and better.

Speaking of Man City, Bellamy was an amazing bit of business. I've always liked the spitfire, and he seems to really hold a strong love for the club.

As Agger said recently, the whole team isn't scoring. All of those signings (well Adam is always a love or hate figure it seems) looked great on paper. Obviously we would have preferred Young to Downing, but we didn't win the league last season and had no European football to offer.

So overall, for a team that has had a lot of new signings to bed in, had an incredible defensive record all season, is having a strong domestic cup run, is in the top 6 of the prem, and you think one of the greatest players/managers to ever grace a red shirt is not the right man for the job?

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"**William Hartnell, first**- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore.

**Patrick Troughton, second** - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

**Jon Pertwee, third**- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

**Tom Baker, fourth** The most famous run. There are so many fantastic stories. Genesis of the Daleks, one of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic. And Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

**Peter Davison, fifth** -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special, andCaves of Androzani!* (the last story)

**Colin Baker, sixth**- His Doctor is unique with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good.

**Sylvester McCoy, seventh**. Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"By tactics I mean trying to sway opinion with bias - not necessarily intentionally, but nonetheless. Bias backfires far too easily, as once you uncover the bias you simply reinforce the other side in thinking that you're making shit up, being biased, etc.

If I wrote an article that argued a point unbiasedly, people would read it and think it somewhat reasonable and be more likely to understand what I wanted to get across to them, be more sympathetic to it, etc. However it would probably not be a very ""strong"" argument that affects the reader too much. If I then decide this article isn't ""strong"" enough and I need to get more people to agree with me then I can introduce some bias to strengthen it. Seems like a good idea, but it usually just re-enforces the beliefs of people who believe it anyway and causes the people who don't to pick it apart and rubbish it.

This is *why* the media is shite as you say, because they all do this far too much. This is why people buy papers simply to tell them what they already ""know"" (believe/think) - just a little re-enforcement to remind them that they are right. People don't buy a paper to change their world view.

It doesn't help that journalists are generally shitty and don't do any more research than they need to print a story. So many stories are entirely without base or merit simply because the journalist never bothered checking into it a little more.

true,swinegums,flair7,,"Huh, I thought Zamora had at least a season at Spurs but you're right. Only 18 appearances. We didn't do him any favours at all. I wonder what Fulham would want for him.

But I am still of the same mind as you - that we should be looking for a permanent signing, a quality first XI striker (I was griping about it pre-season and wasn't impressed when we ""only"" got Adebayor on loan - shows what I know). Doumbia's goals have only come in Switzerland and Russia, those were the weak leagues I was referring to. Although is that right that he's scored 5 in 5 in the CL? I haven't kept up with European football much this season.

Having said that, the only player I would necessarily be looking to move on is Pav, and that only if we could bring in someone better, and at least partly because Harry doesn't rate his work ethic. Some players are just like that - languid. Berbatov was like it. Pav scores some important goals for us when called on but at other times he disappears completely. He's not gonna change, but it doesn't mean he isn't quality. Last season I would have been happy if we'd signed Gyan from Sunderland but I have no idea what has happened there - agents, money, falling out with Bruce? He was quality in his first season there and would have been a great signing. Or maybe we dodged a bullet? 

I was disappointed that we missed out on Cahill in August, and that is done now as he's signed for Chelsea. Samba looks like a beast who can also score - at some point we have to move on from the reliance on Ledley and Gallas is 34. Without those 2 our CB's are Dawson, Bassong and Kaboul and while Kaboul has been amazing this season I think him and Dawson are the junior partners in any CB pairing with Bassong as back up (who would leave if he got his way anyway). 

Hoilett is young enough to make it worthwhile to bring him into the squad as cover, depending on what he'd cost. 

For me then, I won't be that bothered if we don't sign anyone this transfer window. I think the squad is strong enough to maintain 3rd, and should definitely qualify for the CL. Not sure if I'm being cynical but I see the title talk as a bit of a distraction - it's exciting, and amazing that we are even being talked about as pretenders, but consistent CL qualification is surely the most important step at this point? Put it this way, if we qualify for the CL (and I don't really care if that's in 3rd or 4th) I would be happy and we would have had a great season. The title is wonderland - amazing to be in the mix, but we can't be disappointed if it doesn't happen.

We can then look at where we are in the summer. Realistically we might be losing our manager, Pav, Defoe, Adebayor, Bassong, Ledley and the Modric saga could easily resurface. If we can add quality in this transfer window then yes, do it, but I think we're strong enough to maintain a CL qualification spot and the priority should be on that.

Worst case scenario would be last minute dithering, players unsettled and terrible form like we saw for the first 2 games of the season.

As with most things it's on a gradient; it's relative.

At it's extreme there is purposeful bias, where you are writing with intent, with cunning regardless of what you believe, because you are simply tailoring it to be effective. This is the stuff of propaganda, I guess.

Then there is a much more normal personal bias which is what usual comes through when someone is arguing for a case they believe in and not being, shall we say, entirely scientific in their approach.

The thing is, if you really believe that your points are even a little more universally true than simply being an opinion then you should be able to form them in a way that doesn't *require* bias to get your message across (regardless of if some bias ends up in there anyway).

If this is the case then you can at least do as much as you are able to eliminate bias so that what you can can stand without as much distraction from opposing views due to the bias.

true,palordrolap,mccoy,McCoy,"More of the latter I think, although it was explained in show when The Master regenerates into his Harold Saxon incarnation and steals the TARDIS from the end of the universe; His old (in both senses) incarnation says something along the lines of ""So The Doctor has chosen youth and virility, has he? Well two can play at that game!"" prior to the moment of regeneration, suggesting that Time Lords have some kind of control over how their next incarnation will look. This is also has weight lent to it by The Master looking very similar from one incarnation to the next in the classic series.

Therefore, we must assume that The Doctor, where possible, chooses what he will look like.

One and two had the change thrust upon them. Three may have had a choice, but it's hard to tell. The hair was similar as was the strut, so perhaps he carried those over as best as he could, and he was younger looking afterward.

Four chose a distinctly odd mummification as his way out and set it up well in advance, and again he was a young man.

I suspect Five chose not to be so much of a wet lettuce and modelled himself after a strong character he'd met previously.

Six was affected by Time Lords left right and centre, and here I think he had no choice in his form, hence becoming an older man again.

Seven ended up as a young man, but can't have had immediate choice in his form on account of being technically dead at the time of regeneration. We can only assume that he'd put things in place like Four must have, what with the huge remodelling of the TARDIS interior, and the ""I'm retired and winding down"" relaxed behaviour.

Eight to Nine is a big mystery that may never be explained, but notice that both incarnations are of similar build. ""Lots of planets have a 'North'"" suggests he may have regenerated in such a 'North', but that's not required. Seems to have remained about the same age, appearance wise.

Nine to Ten was heavily influenced by the presence of Bad Wolf Rose, so he became the perfect Doctor for her. Even talked the same. Whether he had a choice or not, he ended up younger looking.

Ten to Ten Again and Bad Wolf Bay half-human Ten was influenced by Donna Noble and the spare hand that was Ten's old hand and bore his incarnation's imprint, meaning he stayed completely the same.

Ten Again to Eleven, there were Time Lords around again, but he managed to be rid of them before he was killed. Poor old Wilf did him in without meaning to. ""I don't want to go"" suggests that he may have poured all he had into controlling how he turned out, and ended up as young as we've even known him.

TL;DR Younger actors definitely, but it looks like whenever The Doctor has a choice, he chooses younger.

Ninja Edit: I see my knowledge of the classic series is a bit rusty as it's patently clear that Time Lords have a choice what with Romana doing what she did when she regenerated.",0,1326587681,null,0,false,0,c3h9fb4,t3_ogukd,t1_c3h9fb4,t1_c3h7niz,null,1428181194,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

Speaking out isn't the same as whining.

This is a defeatist attitude, and last time I checked you WEREN'T doing anything about it.  If everyone said ""we can't do anything about it"" then nothing would get done.

I think I've understood it correctly so far.

Am I correct in saying you would not have an arguement with them if they put ""Women's Changing Room"" as a sign over the rooms they intended women to change in? If so then I think you're trying to pick a fight.

Your real argument should be that transgender people should use the facilities intended for the gender they 'are' regardless of their biological gender. I would very much be in favour of that, but it's not a snap change that we can expect overnight. Society will improve over time to the point where we can accommodate everybody without a second thought.

My new insurance cost me £2200 TPFT. 

One of the things that annoys me a *lot* is how much of an affect non-fault accidents have on my premium. I've had two non-fault accidents since I started driving (I was stationary at traffic lights on both occasions) and when I get a quote without declaring them it's consistently around 30% cheaper. Why am I being punished for other people crashing in to me? 

I've had a few people suggest that I get a smaller car. When I was in Halifax I drove a Toyota Celica, which was insurance group 27 (14 in the old groups - I paid £800 on that, remember). After my insurance was cancelled I changed to a Saab 9-3 (also group 27, but was 12 in the old groups - how odd!). Either way, I looked into getting a little group 9 Ford Focus and rang my insurer to see how much I would save. £130. A measly one hundred and thirty quid off a £2200 premium. To be honest, for the sake of £130 I'd rather drive a car that has enough power to overtake and that a larger gentleman such as myself can actually fit in comfortably.

What do people want? A bit of news, but mainly entertainment. Will they pay for it? No. They'll just look at ads. 

The rise of electronic books has seen a phenomenon... people are reading far trashier novels because nobody gets to see the cover.

People who previously subscribed to the broadsheets and convinced themselves that they're a broadsheet reader will perhaps end up looking more at the tabloids.

Additionally as revenue drops for investigative and proper journalism.. then we'll get more celebrity shit and more cut and paste press releases and marketing that a doctor has been paid to sign his name to.

The current enquiry won't affect it, I think... it's just the way things are naturally evolving. The only saving grace, I think, might be that people may drop the pretences, and when they want titillation and erotica they'll go for porn and the like rather than than pretend they're reading the news of the screws for news. Perhaps then we'll see people buying newspapers for news not opinion/gossip/celebrity tits.

No he doesn't.  He can't tell a Polish person that this joke isn't racist because he's a white middle class teenager, the joke isn't marginalising him nor being made at his expense.

&gt;Everyone finds different things offensive, even those who may be the target of ridicule. What makes your definition superior? Would you consider a joke about a ginger/blonde person AS offensive? 

People with different coloured hair aren't commonly targets, nor have been the victims of crimes historically. (except ginger people, with the extent it's mocked in our society it can get pretty bad for them too.  I believe in some cultures they were seen as cursed.).

&gt;What's more important about the differences between a black and a white person compared to the differences between a brunette and a blonde person?

Are you serious?  Hey remember that time the brunettes enslaved the Blonde people?  What about that time when people with green eyes arrived in the country of blue eye'd people and were persecuted by the blue eyes for being different?  Of course not.

The difference is that historically and culturally minorities are mocked or marginalised by the majority.

&gt;I don't hate people based on any physical trait. I make jokes, like everyone does, about pretty much any stereotype or personality trait or whatever. Ofcourse choosing the right moment, but I'm comfortable with any joke if others around me are.

&gt;The point being is that I may be called a racist/sexist/worse for this, but I don't consider that correct. I actually think that I appear to be less concerned here with physical / external differences in any real sense than you or some people commenting in this thread. I think a world free of racism and conflict won't exist when stereotypes and differences are too taboo to dare mention, but when such things can be laughed about, and negatives carry no real weight.

What's your demographic may I ask?  White, Male, 18-35?  Please correct me if i'm wrong.

Smith has the necessary qualities to be the right actor *without* being a fan of the show. Once again, he has the old/new/alien/local thing going on for him. His fandom is irrelevant.

Maybe white middle class teenagers are offended by that assumption? By your own logic, who are you to say otherwise?

The point being, I didn't say he can tell a Polish person what to be offended by. But what one Polish person is offended by doesn't define racism. My view of racism doesn't derive from making jokes, it comes from hatred and misinformation. Someone who makes a joke based on a stereotype isn't necessarily a racist. Someone who acts differently to a certain group of people based on such traits is a racist.

So you only care if the physical differences are commonly targeted? Reading that made me think a lot less of you.

So historical events define the word racism? There is no logic in that. Slavery was terrible from our perspective now, at the time, most people didn't think in the same higher manner. You're the one putting these events on a pedastool now. Historical events happened, no one around is affected by them anymore. I truly believe that. A black person can complain about it, but they're not enslaved now, and no one would want that anymore, so why complain at entirely differently minded people because they're the same skin colour as those who enslaved the people with the same skin colour as you years and years ago? Can you not see the ill logic here?

The last part is contradictory and disgusting. You generalise and make negative stereotypes based on no information whatsoever, whether you're right or wrong.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;You don't know he's a white middle class teenager. Or even if you do I get the feeling that you'll generalise that a lot (I've seen you do so already). Maybe white middle class teenagers are offended by that assumption? By your own logic, who are you to say otherwise?

Actually, I was asking you if you were.  You see, being white, middle class and male comes with privilege.  There is no history of oppression attached to being white, male and middle class in our society or most others in the western world.  So racism against them doesn't come with the horrible past that it does with other forms of racism.  In other words **If I called a white guy cracker i'm sure he'd be able to comfort himself with large amount of advantages in our society that he was born with**.

&gt;My view of racism doesn't derive from making jokes, it comes from hatred and misinformation. Someone who makes a joke based on a stereotype isn't necessarily a racist. Someone who acts differently to a certain group of people based on such traits is a racist.

ENHANCE

&gt;My view

Well, that's it.  It's your view, your definition that you use so you can feel okay with telling that one black joke you know to your mates.  Making a joke based on racial stereotypes is racist.  It normalises racism and makes it more ""okay"" within society, not cool.

&gt;So you only care if the physical differences are commonly targeted? Reading that made me think a lot less of you.

I don't care about physical differences, I care about how others treat others on the basis of ethnicity, gender, sexuality etc.  You can be aware that people are different whilst still treating them as equals.  Which includes not making jokes which trivialise people based on who they are.

&gt;So historical events define the word racism?

Yes they do.  The reason the word ""nigger"" has impact is because of how it was used by slave owners to dehumanize slaves.

&gt;There is no logic in that. Slavery was terrible from our perspective now, at the time, most people didn't think in the same higher manner

Yes, we call this phenomenon  ""Progress"".

&gt;Historical events happened, no one around is affected by them anymore.

The events of the past shape the events of the present, we need to learn from the past so we don't make the same mistakes in the future.

&gt;So historical events define the word racism? There is no logic in that. Slavery was terrible from our perspective now, at the time, most people didn't think in the same higher manner. You're the one putting these events on a pedastool now. Historical events happened, no one around is affected by them anymore. I truly believe that. A black person can complain about it, but they're not enslaved now, and no one would want that anymore, so why complain at entirely differently minded people because they're the same skin colour as those who enslaved the people with the same skin colour as you years and years ago? Can you not see the ill logic here?

The civil rights movement was only a few decades ago and racism still exists, so we still have work to do.  This isn't an equal world yet.

&gt;The last part is contradictory and disgusting. You generalise and make negative stereotypes based on no information whatsoever, whether you're right or wrong. Must I be enslaved for this to become wrong? If you were to make a light hearted joke about white males being racist, I would not care and would take it as the joke it was intended as. If you promote negatives as a result of these generalisations then that is where you are going wrong.

Privilege, as I mentioned above and i'm judging by your response that you are a middle class white male.  Have you ever been really oppressed in your life?  At what point in your upbringing did being a white male have a serious disadvantage when it came to your role in society?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;You suggest that you fully comprehend the nature of the world by age... whatever. Very modest.

Certainly not a full understanding, I admit ""fully comprehend the nature of the world"" was an overstatement.  But biologically, teenager's brains aren't as developed as people of an older age and they don't have as much experience with which to support their rationalisation, decision making skills.

&gt;So if I were a ""privileged"", ""middle class white male"", to use your terminology, could I ask you if you know any Polish people that are not cleaners working in the UK, with confidence like your question?

Yeah, I have 3 polish friends although I'm only really in contact with one these days.  Lost touch with one, and one moved back home and one still lives with one of my friends in Hull.  Of course you've only got my word for it.  None of them cleaners, last time I checked but to be fair I don't keep track of all the jobs my friends have.

&gt;You can claim that you're age comments come from facts and evidence about growth over time. I could claim my work comments come from facts about immigrants commonly having to take low paying basic jobs upon first arrival.

Which immigrants?  Not all immigrants need to, but all I have to support this is anecdotal evidence at the moment.

&gt;My point remains you have to have a bit more perspective and be open minded.

I am open minded, that doesn't mean I agree.  If not wanting to make jokes based on racial stereotypes makes me closed minded then call me a locked gate.

&gt;I merely stepped in to defend people you spent the evening arguing with then bashing in a separate line of comments.

I've kept the title of the article in every bit so if there is anything you like, just search /r/doctorwho for that title. Take a look in the middle of the image though. To the left are some numbers saying what sort of posts there are (this may not be exactly accurate), average number of upvotes and comments and reposts I spotted. But the main thing is the graph.

(Also [png here just in case](https://public.bay.livefilestore.com/y1pcPgU-DBDKICLK-1hur-gsP_dTTACwx2KkaiEmmv2orRh1pHDw2Tit-G8oduSQB5oj_RvD9JZY_3QVBFAkJRGIQ/DW%20Reddit%20Collage%20Sat.png))

Just a few comments that I'd like to make from it.

1)The image is a tad big.

2)We don't have that few an amount of discussions. People just are unable to see it to be able to upvote it because of the sheer mass of other stuff.

3)You may not tell from this image just today, but people sure do like selling stuff.

4)There are shitloads of posts that no one apparently cares about. Just look at the graph, there's loads around the 0 region (and even a few below it). Don't forget about the number of comments too! Now combine that with the fact that this is one of the top 100 subreddits with over 39,000 subscribers and hey presto.

5)6 reposts is a lot considering the fact that by the time I got around to looking at it, the mods will have deleted a fair few already.

I'm sure there was other stuff for me to say but I just can't remember it.

Also, it's very sad to see that Kuyt is losing it.  I want to see him get his 50th goal, but he just doesn't look like he deserves a place on the starting 11.  He looked completely lost as a striker today and seemed to just fall back and get lost somewhere on the field.

As a worker the last thing I want is a ""second layer of management"" interfering in what I do. What I do want is an organisation I can call upon when *I* need it to provide services and advice when *I* want it.

The last thing I need is that organisation expecting to be able to tell me what to do, when to do it, and for how much.

A union that acts more like an advisory/legal/consultancy service that I can call upon when in need of help, and leaves me along at the rest of the time, would get a lot more members signing up than these relics of the 1970s that seem to permeate some industries.

Currently offshore wind (which we are currently pioneering) isn't particularly good value for money. Something like twice the price per kWH of gas/nuclear. Onshore wind is a comparable price although then you have the whole problem of the NIMBY people.

Offshore wind is a relatively new concept and to be honest I don't really the think the companies putting them up have a sensible system together yet. They're still trying out different things to work out the most efficient way to erect them.

Currently they're loading one or maybe two masts &amp; turbines onto a flat-bottomed barge then they'll wait for really calm weather before slowly towing the barge to where the thing is to be erected before carefully putting it up with a big floating crane.

Over time though I'd expect that they'll make dedicated craft for carrying &amp; erecting which can operate in harsher seas and carry a lot more turbines out at once. Once they've got a good system for erecting them the price of offshore wind should drop significantly.

The potential for offshore vastly outstrips that of onshore though, as the wind is far more reliable and there's no NIMBY factor to contend with so no planning issues.",0,1326627470,null,0,false,0,c3hdzfv,t3_ohu27,t1_c3hdzfv,t1_c3hdix4,null,1428183425,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

Jokes don't make people unequal, they don't trivialise as there's nothing **to** trivialise. I can make a joke about a white person and about a black person. I have no negative feelings towards either. It is **you** who makes a big difference here. **You** who encourages separation. What the fuck does your imaginary rich white kid, oppressed enslaved black guy fantasy story have to do with it? Ancient history and a generalisation which is 100% wrong... Good basis for your argument right there.

Many many lack people use the term nigger. They have desensitized it. This is good and this is healing. A eutopian world doesn't consist of blacklisted words, it consists of understanding and rationalisation. Nigger is a word, and I will treat it as nothing more.

You're going around making this an ""equal world"" very, very wrongly.

I find it difficult to comment on your last paragraph. I'm not sure if you're genuinely a racist or just dumb at this point. I don't know how someone can claim to oppose racism in all its form, applying 0 personal thought or logic at all, then reel off the most generalised, racist bullshit in the whole thread, because **it's okay, you're saying it about white people, that isn't racist because I can generalise all white youths to privileged biggots.**

I am a white male, I am 18-35. I have supported myself through school, university and am beginning a career out of my hard fucking work. But to you it's because I'm a white guy... Fuck you. That's from me and everyone else who looks and see's people defined by factors other than skin colour **first**. I have black friends who have done the same. Not one of them would say their skin colour has ever held them back.

I think pushing to get 3rd rather than 4th is important though - it's the difference between going straight into the CL group stage or having to play the qualification round. Though I'm confident we could get through that, it makes signing players easier when you can guarantee CL group stage appearance from the beginning of the summer.

I'm hoping we pick up one of the strikers we've mentioned before the end of the month - a big signing like that could be the difference in convincing the likes of Modric to stay in the summer, aside from the boost it'd give us for the run in.

You then go out to the car, take some photos of the car with your camera, get the agent to make a note of any dings or scratches and make a note and photograph the fuel gauge, tyre tread (1.6mm across 75% of the width of the wheel), brake lights and other AA standard checks.

true,seeQer11,lfc68,,"I've been defending Carroll for awhile now saying he just needs time. After the stoke match though I'm finally starting to wear thin. I think he will be great in 3 or 4 years... but by then I am afraid it is too late for success at Liverpool... especially if things keep continuing how they are. 

Right now he is a headcase. I was happy to see the home fan support when he was subbed on... Thought maybe it would help him. Clearly it didn't. Just watch his body language. One little fuck up or play that doesn't go his way his head is down. He hangs his head and is extremely frustrated at the littlest things and stops playing. This lead to him blocking Hendo's shot (the first of two). I've personally been there and I know the feeling and whats going through your head. You beat yourself up, your own worst critic, almost in an attempt to show others you care and are trying... but it is all negativity and doesn't help anything. 

His mind isn't in the right place... he subs on and slips on the pitch and what does he do? He changes his studs (I assume he went with the longer/soft ground studs). Obviously I don't know for certain, but no one else was having issues with the grounds. I think this was more a mental issue than physical one, but I could be wrong... regardless you are a professional and you shouldn't be figuring this out during the actual game. 

What really is baffling to me is his lack of strength and power in his legs. I remember not being game fit after an injury and it took a long while to get my legs back. There would be moments where my brain was telling me to go and my legs just couldn't muscle through and do what they needed to. This is exactly what Carroll looks like to me when he stumbles, slips and falls all over the pitch. So whats the fucking deal? Why aren't his legs strong and more match ready? After the Stoke match, more than anything this is what is concerning me. Is he not taking training seriously with high intensity? Is he out boozing too much? Seriously what gives? No one of his size and capable power should be flopping around like a wet noodle... hes had a year since his injury to recover.

That said, to get out of it... I think the biggest help was changing teams.  I don't know if it was all down to that or not. But it definitely didn't hurt. 

I am a striker and the team I was on I was miserable and frustrated as shit. Had 0 goals and a few chances. The next year I started playing with a different team and everything changed. Part of it was I was getting much more game time and finally finding my legs and form again. Another part of it is I really got along better with my teammates. We just had a more fluid style and I wasn't alone on an island anymore. That year I actually led the league in goals and we ended up winning the final that season. Pretty big difference in a year. The quality of the competition was the same, but the quality of my new team was probably better though...

I think another big part of it is I also stopped giving a fuck. Sometimes my teammates would get pissed if I fucked up, didn't score or pass to them when I should have or could have. I realized you won't ever be 100% perfect and stopped worrying about it and started just having fun and loving the game again.

During construction sound levels close to the site reach levels which can cause temporary hearing damage (or possibly permanent damage as foundation size increases) to species which use sound as their primary sense for interacting with their environment. This limits their ability to locate food or 'see' where they are going with echolocation. This noise is mostly produced by pile driving the foundation into the sea bed, though there is also a contribution from dredging activity and increased ship traffic.

After construction the operational noise from one wind turbine is so low as to be considered benign. The sum total of many wind farms may add to overall background level though and this could become an issue if large numbers of wind farms are built near each other (within 100km or so - underwater sound travels far).",0,1326636691,null,0,false,0,c3hejcx,t3_ohu27,t1_c3hejcx,t1_c3hee1a,null,1428183680,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

* Willful, stubborn or rebellious - so they can wander off and get in trouble
* Emotionally attached - so that their loved ones can be put in danger, complicating the Doctor's decisions

true,guavacat,uk,London,"Note: This is only conjecture. The difference between Google and Richard O'Dwyer's website, in my opinion, is this:

1. **Intention to link to copyrighted goods.** While both do link and not host copyrighted goods, Google have been shown to remove links where they are directly told it infringes some kind of law. Google acknowledge this fact on specific search result pages where a search result has been removed. However, O'Dwyer wilfully and directly knows that almost all links are to copyrighted goods; moreover, he doesn't take any action to remove them.

2. **Google doesn't exist to link you to copyrighted goods** - it's a search engine. I don't know the percentage but I would say a fair big percentage are 'legitimate' links, while TV Shack effectively exists to link you to copyrighted goods. Mind you, it's not done in a way that's like ""LOL watch this copyrighted stuff on my website today!"", but it's fairly clear from the name of the website that it's primary function is to bring TV shows to you - which are 95% under some IP protection. Google, on the other hand, is really just an empty vessel. It says nothing about watching cool copyrighted stuff on the Internet. It's just a search engine.

3. **Technical differences** - correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that Google's search algorithms and spiders are automatic. Thousands of pages are added each day to the search index and most of these are not acknowledged Google on a personal basis at all. If you were to ask a search product expert about new entries on Google today, I am quite sure they wouldn't know in most circumstances. Do you think people email Google to ask ""Hey, do you have a mirror link for Nemo (Disney movie)?"" They might do, but it's probably not what the average viewer would do. I am not saying that O'Dwyer would know, but I'm betting he gets a whole lot more emails saying ""OMG your link is down! Put a new one up!"" meaning that he is *aware* of the copyrighted goods on his website, to some extent. While he doesn't do the manual linking to copyrighted goods, he is exposed to what is linked on his website on a much more intimate basis than Google is. For that, it might be argued his added knowledge points him to some modicum of guilt.

Here we have the tension between the extent of 'responsibility' of a big website vs a small website. Google has numbers, automation, the aspect of being impersonal, and does comply if told to take down stuff when told directly. TV Shack may very well take down links if requested (I am not sure), but does O'Dwyer's responsibility exceed Google's, just because it's smaller and therefore more 'aware'?

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; As I understand it, wave is very speculative at the moment.

True.  It was also very speculative back in the late 1970s and early 80s when it was first being researched.  Then one day the government pulled all funding and announced that it was backing nuclear power instead.  It is widely believed (especially by [Thomas Salter, the inventor of ""Salter's Ducks""](http://www.theengineer.co.uk/in-depth/stephen-salter-pioneer-of-wave-power/299034.article)) that the nuclear industry nobbled it to avoid too much competition.

&gt; In the early 1980s, the government closed the wave-energy project. Salter thinks this was politically motivated; the nuclear industry was heavily represented on the panel awarding energy grants and its members became concerned as the cost projections came down. ‘When the programme manager predicted that with development, the cost would be 3.3p/kWh, which was getting close to being economically viable even then, they excluded him from the next important meeting of the key committee,’ said Salter. ‘They basically killed the project because it was going to threaten the expansion of the nuclear industry,’ he claimed.

true,Admiral_Bison,,Belfast,"Having read all the back and forth comments on this thread, I can sympathize with both prospectives - I understand the need to protect the freedom of speech, and the desire to prevent ANY sort curtailment of it (presumable due to the often rightly held fears of ""Give Governments an inch, they'll take miles). I also understand the need to protect the wider society at large (presumable on the sometimes correct assumption, though we don't like to admit it, that dangerous ideas can influence society negatively - or prompt actions that damage us irrecoverable). 

I guess I'm not sure which way to go on this, my idealism tells me that we should trust ourselves and each other to do the right thing and allow for this to go on while treating it with the contempt it deserves to highlight the hateful bigotry of this groups activities.

However, my experience and fears tell me that we should stop these groups from operating so freely because they will damage people, hurt society and could cause suicides or violence as they have in the past.

I can't chose where to lay my allegiance - as  both points seem so valid to me... However I can't help but think that there should be a middle ground. We can't police what these people do or say when in these conferences (let's face it, they could be inferring violent attacks for all we know, and how could we know, or prove it? the power of suggestion is a tricky one to prove legally or even chart... Would we even have the spending power to government rep to police these meetings? and if we did, isn't that still heading toward a fascism we ought to be avoiding...?)

On the flip side of the coin, to let these groups continue, undeterred gives them a false position of legitimacy within our society. It's no secret to the average person that their belief systems are considered more than valid under other countries governments - so without taking a stance against them within our own (and I don't necessarily mean by taking legal action via a hypothetically created piece of legislation ruling against their actions as hate speech, I mean by any means, whether that be by being allowed to be discriminated against by particular venues, or their 'therapies' being prevented by other fashions, such as false advertisement chargers - eg, you can't make someone not homosexual via therapy etc).

You know, I starting writing this up thinking I would have made my mind up after thinking through all the above... but honestly I'm more indecisive than I was before I bloody started... I would like to live in a perfect world, where we could prevent these sorts of negative influences taking hold of people, hurting them and potentially charging them with more hateful tools to hurt others (such as a religious family bringing their young, potentially gay or bisexual son or daughter to such an event) but I'm not sure our tools to stop this would be any less hateful or hurtful than the tools this group is using and two wrongs don't make a right...

I see two problems - 1. We don't know how much NESV is willing to spend 2. Without Champions League or a realistic title run to offer, you're not going to attract world class talent. Attracting even the top class targets is limited.

So, we have to choose from 1. slightly older but proven players, 2. young, unproven possible stars, 3. overlooked goldmines (i.e. Suarez).

The first is that they each use hundreds of kilos of neodymium, a rare earth metal. The mining process for neodymium (which is mostly from china) causes massive amounts of environmental devastation, outweighing the environmental benefits of producing electricity from this 'renewable' resource. Most people do not take into account the full life cycle of a wind turbine, and don't seem to care that we are polluting china to meet our own goals for being environmentally friendly.
See [here](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1350811/In-China-true-cost-Britains-clean-green-wind-power-experiment-Pollution-disastrous-scale.html), [here](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/05/clean-energy-apos-s-dirty-little-secret/7377/) and [here](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec09/china_12-14.html) for more info.

The second problem is one of scale: take for example a nuclear power that is rated at 1GW (1000MW). That would normally run at around 80% capacity, so its output is 800MW. Compare that to wind turbines. A normal sized wind turbine is rated at about 2MW, but usually runs at around 40% capacity, ie 0.8MW. That means to replace one nuclear power station, you would need a thousand wind turbines, and even if you did this, you would still need to build either a coal or gas power station to take up the slack when the wind isn't blowing.

My beef is that if the union says jump, I am not just expected to jump, but required to do so.

People simply don't want that sort of crap from unions any more.

I don't want unions forcing me to accept their pay negotiations when I didn't ask them to negotiate my pay for me. I don't want unions telling me I have to accept their negotiated settlements and strike demands.

Most people are perfectly happy with pay for performance, not layers of grades and red-tape for moving around between departments. Most people don't actually want stratification.

What I want is what most people I have spoken to want - an organisation that responds to our needs when we ask, without trying to act as another layer of tedious management getting in the way all the time.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"It is a sad story, but lets look at what's happened for him to be in this position.

He got a credit card and ran it up and is now paying £33 out of his benefits each month. He made an exceptionally poor choice in going for the credit card, and he should consider bankruptcy as a way of getting out of it. If after 2 years out of work there's no light at the end of the tunnel then bankruptcy will at least stop that £33 a month from coming out.

The crisis loan he had was probably given under realistic crisis conditions. It's scandalous that the same agency doling out the benefits is taking money from him. Really, what the fuck do they get for £10 a month versus what they're meant to do aside from helping him live? If he can be means tested for a crisis loan, surely it should be a crisis grant?

£15 for child maintenance for a man on JSA seems awfully high for me. There must be a route for him to appeal. I don't know if bankruptcy would help or not at this point.

The guy's in a bad way and the whole country's in a bad way, I understand that. He's made some poor choices and the government should be trying to help. Taking money from his benefits is far from helping.

The only way people are going to get out of poverty is by dragging themselves out.

I'm an ecologist that nearly solely works on collision risks with birds. Nearly all of my sites I visit are fucking boring with no bird life. So I have no issues with that.

I do however wish they were more honest with the carbon dioxide side of things. Lots of turbines are built on moorland, where peat is. Peat is a carbon store. Digging up peat bogs and letting it dry out means that carbon dioxide is released into the air. Coupled with the amount of concrete used to form the base, this leads to many years of a winds turbine life before it becomes carbon neutral, as many as 12 years. Did you know that ONE cement factory in England produces as much CO2 in a year as ALL of the worlds planes flying around? Oops, broken that fallacy that it's cars and planes ruining the world. (Tried finding the link but it was for a project at uni 6 years ago and can't now)

Since the average turbine lasts 25 years before needing to be replaced this leads to a pretty ineffective design currently. We need to do something but without the subsidies there's going to be no improvement in design. That's why they are a good idea.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"The Mirror is a staunch Labour paper, Adam Curtis did a brilliant documentary about the paper's early history, but I can't be arced to find the link, sorry.

The Guardian is a little more complex. The quality of dedication to accurate stories is absolutely second to none. They have a level of tenacity and a lack of fear that the others paper have and I really respect them for that. However I find the Guardian is often liberal for liberalism's sake (in the classical sense of liberalism). The problem is that the world seems (to me) to be right of centre, and the guardian's reporting doesn't reflect that. What we all seem to want is left of centre, but it doesn't seem to be happening no matter how we try.

To give you an example, the Guardian is traditionally left leaning and Labour in their last term were so disgusting that it was obvious that they weren't palatable to the electorate, yet until the lib dems emerged in the tv debates as a potential alternative to labour, the guardian stuck with the champagne socialists. This to me is not credible. Newspapers should be free to report without political agenda or alignment, and perhaps I'm spewing a left of centre idea that the press should be properly independent, but until the Guardian switched, it didn't seem to report on wrongs by the then current administration with anywhere near the fervour of the shadow tory cabinet.

I'm not suggesting this is a problem with the guardian, but a problem with the media and the political system as a whole. Still, having said that I massively respect the effort the guardian puts into it's stories, the bravery it has in publishing them and especially when so many other papers are regurgitating press releases or acting solely as propaganda outlets.",0,1326666687,null,0,false,0,c3hiu19,t3_oi1xk,t1_c3hiu19,t1_c3hhqve,null,1428185712,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Well, The Doctor comes and saves the day by destroying diamond.

Turns out that the guy knew about Martha too though, as he eagerly abducted her and infected her with the parasites.

I totally agree with your concerns of misinformation (e.g. impact of copyright infringement on the economy); it's just that all these big record companies also have damning statistics on gazillions of millions 'lost' to piracy every year. After all, if you torture the statistics enough, eventually they will confess in the end. Grave statistics and money = language of policy-makers, and it's these lobbyists who they rub elbows with. We also don't have the kind of language or ideas that resonate with the people on top. A lot of people simply believe things should be free because they've always historically had it for free, for example.

With regards to your point about the complicit judiciary, I will say a lot of judges are very fair about this issue - but the main problem is the huge gap between us and them caused by the fast-paced evolution of technology. These judges/policy-makers sometimes don't really understand what all of this technology means to us and how our behaviour is shaped by it - you can't simply force a specific business model on the Internet just because it's worked in real life, for example. Law has historically always lagged behind social norms and technology as well. :(

I have to say, I don't really understand the extradition decision. Is it because the TV shows that were pirated are US-produced?

true,faswich,cyberman,Cyberperson,"Way back when, in the time of the legend himself, William Hartnell, the writers had to come up with a plan to deal with the lead changing. The Doctor was already alien, so this way the show could continue.

&gt;Hartnell's deteriorating health (he suffered from arteriosclerosis, which began to affect his memory and hence his ability to learn lines), as well as poor relations with the new production team on the series after the departure of Verity Lambert, ultimately led him to leave Doctor Who in 1966.
&gt;When he left Doctor Who, the producer of the show came up with a unique idea: since the Doctor is an alien, he can transform into another man when he dies, thereby renewing himself. William Hartnell himself suggested that Patrick Troughton should be cast as the new Doctor. In Episode 4 of the serial The Tenth Planet, the First Doctor regenerated into Troughton's Second Doctor.

After that, its just a manner of switching up the show but keeping the formula the same.

true,DaveLambert,tardis,TARDIS,"The 1st Doctor, William Hartnell, left because he had an arterial disease which affected his brain, including his ability to learn his lines.  This very real REQUIREMENT to get him out of the role forced the production team to invent what later became known as ""regeneration"", in order to keep the successful show going despite Hartnell's leaving.

The 2nd Doctor, Patrick Troughton, decided the work schedule to play this role was too tough on him, and was also concerned about being typecast in the role, so he gave it up after 3 years as the lead.

The 3rd Doctor, Jon Pertwee, originally stated typecasting as a desire to return to the theatrical stage as his reasons for leaving, but later on revealed that his actual reasons were more to do with the departures of certain cast and crew members, including the death of his friend Roger Delgado, who played The Master.

The 4th Doctor, Tom Baker, left the show because he didn't get along with John Nathan-Turner...someone who started as part of the floor crew and worked his way up to lead producer on the show.  When he took over as the main producer, Baker decided it was time to move on.

The 5th Doctor, Peter Davison, was advised by Patrick Troughton (the 2nd Doctor, who Davison watched and loved during his time in the role) to sign up for 3 years and not renew his contract following that, to avoid being typecast.  My understanding is that Davison followed that advice to the letter.

The 6th Doctor, Colin Baker, performed in the final story of the 21st season/series, performed in the 22nd season/series, and then there was a year-and-a-half long break where they were re-evaluating the show and the lead actor.  They gave him one more shot with the entire 23rd season/series being one big storyline, ""Trial of a Time Lord"".  The reception and ratings weren't good enough for the BBC, so they fired Colin from the part.

The 7th Doctor, Sylvestor McCoy, took over the role until the original show was cancelled in 1989.  He came back briefly for the 1996 Fox Network ""movie"", to provide continuity fromt he 7th to 8th Doctor.

The 8th Doctor, Paul McGann, was out of his role by virtue of the telefilm he was in, which was to serve as a pilot for a return of the program, didn't get picked up as a regular series.  Nevertheless he's continued in the role for audio adventures of the 8th Doctor.

The 9th Doctor, Christopher Eccleston, said in an interview this past year that he was proud of his time as the Doctor, but that he ""didn't enjoy the environment and the culture that...the cast and crew had to work in"", and felt he had to leave.

It's not been made entirely clear why the 10th Doctor, David Tennant, left the role when he did.  He's said publicly things like ""if I didn't leave it when I did, I never would, and everyone would get sick of me"" and ""I always prefer to leave a role when it's still exciting and fresh"".  Regardless, it's clear that it was his decision to leave, and that after being in the role for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th series/seasons of the new show, he basically was convinced to do the group of specials which concluded his time on the program.  What's also clear is that just as soon as he wrapped up his shooting as the Time Lord, he was fairly quickly seen in Hollywood, USA, looking for L.A.-based roles (including the failed TV pilot *Rex Is Not Your Lawyer*); if you ask me he left the role because he was interested in becoming an American-based film star while his name was quite big.  Of course his biggest film role since leaving the show was in the remake of *Fright Night*.

Also, a kind of normal companion was a nice break (somewhat spoiled by River being the most special being to have existed)

**River** I think was interesting, but she irks me because he plot (and the mid season break/general show format) took away the independent, closed off story lines. As for her being a Mary-Sue, I disagree, though she is used too often for humor along the lines of,

""What if the Doctor was really rubbish by actual Time Lord standards?""

or, ""Isn't the Doctor really frigid asexual?"" That got grating fast.

As for her character being over sexual, I think it fits with her being Amy's daughter (I can imagine Mel seeing Amy being flirty and thinking ""I'll impress mum by being thrice as flirty as that), and it fits with her general over confidence which stems from a lack of confidence which in turn stems from realising that her entire purpose in life was deceitful, manipulative, and malicious.

As for the tactics and Kenny. I agree for the most part. Except Enrique and Johnson played more as wingbacks and we had 3 center backs. I don't think this was a bad decision as it created problems for stoke picking up men coming forward on the wings. Teams like Stoke are always going to sit 10 men behind the ball against us at home. The problem, as you said... there was absolutely nobody from the midfield getting forward into the box and we lacked any penetrating threat from the middle. Where the hell were Adam, Henderson, Downing and Gerrard besides passing it around outside the 18? 

My biggest problem with Kenny's tactics; He wanted to put Kuyt up top and play a more speedy pass and move style of football to work the ball around Stoke's big, strong and lumbering defense. So why not play Bellamy and Maxi alongside him? Why were these three never on the pitch at the same time. I have a feeling we are in negotiations to sell Maxi soon as he wasn't even on the bench.

However I do think Dalglish was wrong with the team he put out. Carroll and/or Bellamy should have started ahead of Kuyt and Hendo/Downing. And Maxi should not have been left out of the teamsheet like he was.

2. Starting as David Tennant would be a poor choice in my opinion, as his adventures are more or less a direct continuation of Eccleston's. And though starting with Matt Smith is plausible, I strongly do not advise this as you would be missing so much good content. I'd say to give Eccleston more of a chance.

3. Well, Doctor Who is a rather unique show, so I can't really compare it to anything else. Almost every episode tries something new, in a good way.

I strongly advise you to keep watching until Season 1: Episode 6: Dalek. Eccleston absolutely shines in this episode, and it's hardly cheesy. Season 1 has mostly really great episodes in its second half, though subsequently the first half suffers a bit.

If you still remain doubtful, watch Season 3: Episode 10: Blink. It is considered by many, myself included, to be the best episode in the new series, and with good reason.

2)It looks like others here disagree with me, but I'd say just skip the Eccleston season, particularly if you're not liking it.  You can start off with the first David Tennant episode without being lost.  Sure, there will be a few plot points that might have had more impact if you'd stuck through season one, but you'll understand what's going on.  Especially if the Eccleston season is making you not want to continue watching, I say skip ahead to Tennant.

3)It's difficult to compare this show to anything else, but the one thing that jumps out to me as relevant is The X-Files.  The stories tend to be focused on a monster-of-the-week, but there is definitely an overarching story that moves along.  Some of the stories are surprisingly funny, some of the stories are surprisingly scary.  Romantic tension is thrown around a lot, sometimes in an interesting way, sometimes in a way that feels unnecessary.

Watch how Mueller celebrates his goals. The way he celebrates is identical to how Dalglish celebrated. Mueller is relatively speedy, but no one considers him as a speed demon. He is technically adept, but no one thinks of him as having buckets of technique. The thing that he has, is a whole load of footballing intelligence. He can see how the goal can be set up. He passes into spaces that no one else sees. He gets into perfect positions to score. Not loads of goals. Not loads of assists. What he does, is change the game. He is incredibly influential in almost every game he plays. 

Mueller came into prominence playing off 3 kinds of players. The first is a creative winger/striker. In Munich, that role is played by Robben and Ribeiry. In Germany, that is Ozil. The second is a big striker. Gomez and Klose fulfilled that role. The last, is a creative midfielder who can pass and run and score. Schweinsteiger does that. 

Look at Liverpool. We have a tall, big striker who is currently starved of service and shrinking under the media attention, but is commonly considered as having the potential to do very well. We have a creative winger/striker in the form of Suarez, who runs, creates and scores. We have Gerrard. We have the circumstances that make it easy for Mueller to fit in. We have a solid defense and strong fullbacks to support him. Kuyt is ageing and we need to find a replacement for him soon. It is perfect timing. He is perfect for our needs. 

Throw up 40 million for him. According to all reports, Mueller is incredibly resistant of the celebrity lifestyle, very humble and grounded. He will be able to take the media pressure. Maradona thought he was a ballboy during a press conference. Mueller went on to rip Argentina apart. 

I am becoming a broken record when it comes to this guy, because it is my firm belief that out of all the players I have ever seen in the world, this guy is the one who can be just like the King.

The first season was really a feeler because the writers didn't know in what direction to bring the show. This produced some seriously painful experiences (especially the farting aliens...ugh!) but they do figure it out in the end. Eccleston's run is really strange, since he has some terrific episodes (Dalek, Empty Child/Doctor Dances, season finale) but in between there's some serious misses (Rose, farting aliens). Just stick with it and it gets much, much better. 

2. Definitely stick to where you are. Despite the shitty writing and premises of a few episodes, he's fantastic. But honestly, I'd recommend skipping Aliens of London, World War Three, and Boom Town. The Slitheen (aforementioned farting aliens) are pretty much the lowest point in Doctor Who history. Others agree with me. If you decide to skip them, I'll tell you all you need to know from that shitfest: [](/s ""look up a photo of Harriet Jones. She is a hard-hitting reporter that saves the day. She appears later.

And 10 had some of that, but not to the degree 11 does, at least not in a way that resonates with me. But I think where 11 really grows is the power that he has inside of him. 

Maybe I'm just not remembering 10 properly, but 11 can stop being irreverent and crazy, and he stares down his enemy with nothing to lose. He talks, and entire fleets of ships stop to listen. He mobilizes people to save themselves without them knowing what they ever did, or that they were even in danger. And without a weapon in his hand, he can strike fear into the hearts of a well armed militia. He is fiercely protective of his loved ones, and he's willing to die to save them. He is clever and quick and loving and stupidly brave. He is The Doctor.

true,TheTyger,tennant,Tennant,"I have 2 separate thoughts about where to start.

Firstly, If you managed to make it past the first couple seasons of ST:TNG, and could endure the mess that it was, just keep plowing forward from Rose.  That first season is not the best, but there is some great stuff that will come up in passing later.  If you don't know these things, not the end of the world, but having the context for everything is great.

If you really must skip that first season for now (you can always come back later), I would say there are 2 places to start.  The beginning of any doctor tends to be a good place, as the new character must re-learn the universe a bit, which tends to slow down the plot conventions.  The same could sorta be said for the different companions, but not as much.  So The start of a doctor is a good place to pick up.  If you really think about it, starting with Rose is actually doing just that, as it is the beginning of the 9th doctor.

2. the beginning is the best starting point, always good to know where the companions came from so you can see how they grow and how they, in turn, help the Doctor grow.

3. I know Torchwood is a spin-off and is good in its own right, but nothing is really quite like Doctor Who, its got its own flavor and verve that nothing else can match.

true,alshaw,null,null,"Your analysis seems to miss the bigger picture. The article is not about Thomas Bebb; it's about a city in which one third of households have no-one in them who is working, and in which there are seven unemployed people for every job vacancy.

Your claim that Mr Bebb made ""an exceptionally poor choice"" in using a credit card suggests that you may have not yet personally faced the reality of coping with a huge loss of income in a short space of time, with a family to support. Perhaps you have. If not, then you will not be aware that the ""choices"" open to an individual in those circumstances are extremely limited. A repayment schedule of £33 per month roughly equates to a credit card debt (at prevailing rates of 17%) of about £4000. When facing a drastic loss of earnings in the short term, this is not a vast amount to have to come up with during those months of  transition. 

You're correct, of course, that Mr Bebb could seek personal bankruptcy. Which could make him £33 a month better off in the short term. 

Your assumption that ""there must be a route for him to appeal"" his £15 JSA is just that - an assumption. It is common to hear people with little direct experience of the benefits system make such statements, as if making them solves the problem. I would be interested to know if you have any evidence to support your assertion.

Finally, you ask whether Mr Bebb could set up his own maintenance company. Actually, I partly agree with you at this point! The reality is that the employee-employer model of work is the primary one advocted as the solution by politicians across the spectrum. And in a globalised economy it is a hugely unstable model, as the situation in Liverpool shows. Alternative models - self-employment, worker-owned businesses and co-operatives, offer major benefits to workers and their families. However, there are significant structural obstacles at present to widespread adoption of these models of employment. There is certainly more that governments could do to facilitate such grass-roots economic activity, but the evidence so far is that the current government is still rather wedded to the central role of large corporations in employment creation.

Which leads me back to where I started. This article is not primarily about Thomas Bebb; it's about a city in which the employer-employee model of job creation has manifestly failed. With imaginative leadership, however, Liverpool, like Detroit in the USA, could begin to lead the way out of this unsustainable model and towards a new type of local economy. Which strikes me as infnitely preferable to some form of managed decline.    ",0,1326704928,null,0,false,0,c3hoj1m,t3_oi607,t1_c3hoj1m,t1_c3hh6yp,null,1435747366,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

The reason he couldn't ""snatch machines from the future"" is that he had no fine control (obviously) over what remained of the abilities of his TARDIS, which also explains the ""why an airplane full of humans"" because his time corridor was simply a ""throw out a line and see what you catch"" type of deal, a ""desperate lifeline to the future"" to quote the Doctor.

""Research on employee ownership has focused on questions of productivity,
profitability, and employee attitudes and behavior, while there has been
little attention to the most basic measure of performance: survival of the
company. This study uses data on all U.S. public companies as of 1988,
following them through 2001 to examine how employee ownership is related
to survival. Estimation using Weibull survival models shows that companies
with employee ownership stakes of 5% or more were only 76% as likely as
firms without employee ownership to disappear in this period, compared
both to all other public companies and to a closely matched sample without
employee ownership. While employee ownership is associated with higher
productivity, the greater survival rate of these companies is not explained by
higher productivity, financial strength, or compensation flexibility. Rather,
the higher survival is linked to their greater employment stability, suggesting
that employee ownership companies may provide greater employment
security as part of an effort to build a more cooperative culture, which
can increase employee commitment, training, and willingness to make
adjustments when economic difficulties occur These results indicate that employee ownership may have an important role to play in increasing job and income security, and decreasing levels of unemployment. Given the fundamental importance of these issues for economic well being, further research on the role of employee ownership would be especially valuable.""",0,1326709081,null,0,false,0,c3hothm,t3_oia36,t1_c3hothm,t1_c3hosli,null,1428188716,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

And then you mix the idea of having faith draw you closer to dealing with your fears is absolutely chilling. The fact that Rory ""didn't"" have faith in something doesn't mean he doesn't believe in his wife. Im sure to Rory he only does what is in his power to control to deal with things and not just blindly go to faith like Amy did (does) so often when she says Oh the Doctor will fix it, he always does. Rory taught Amy CPR to help revive him, he constantly challenges The Doctor that he should have done more because if he was there, Rory would have tried harder or done something more to save his wife (Hungry Earth). The idea that everyone has something that will trigger them to fall back on to a faith is very human. Regardless of what it is, luck, religion, conspiracy, a person etc... It is a very scary idea to be in so big a danger that faith consumes you and almost makes you calm and lifeless to the point that you let things take their course without trying to do anything yourself. That to me is the reason Rory has no faith. He isn't the person that lets things happen in front of him and leave it up to an unknown power to take care of it. The shifting maze hotel adds to the haunting idea of letting yourself be consumed by your faith. What does someone do when they are lost in a maze? Panic, run around helpless, cry, get scared, sit down helpless, frozen in shock... pray for a way out. this was a very self reflecting episode for the characters and audience in many ways.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"Wind farms are often wildly misrepresented in the news by people that, quite frankly, don't know any better. They should not been seen as a stop gap, but think of it this way; our need of energy is not going down, but we can control our emission of CO2.

People often spout the average amount of energy from a wind farm as being important. It isn't that useful of a statistic; think of it like cricket, an average is an indication of how good a player is when they perform but the variance in their scores tells you that this is just a figure that can go up and down depending on (and here's the crucial part) other competing variables. This is what makes their placement so important and, with the nature of capitalism and protecting your ideas, it is somewhat of a dark art. Weather is a chaotic system, we can interpret and correlate data but things are far from certain.

This is why they go into the north sea. But putting a wind farm in offshore is really expensive. Land is less effective but is easier to get done considering the short term nature of decision making in parliament and our society's capitalist philosophy.

On the whole ""eyesore"" issue, I find it hard to agree with this for two reasons:

* I like using my dishwasher, washing machine, having warm power showers, boiling water for cups of tea and using reddit (amongst other things).

* They look a damn sight better than massive coal power plants.

* Climate change is real (no-one seriously disagrees with this any more) and the body of evidence to suggest that its man made is growing.

The case against wind farms is that, alone, they will not solve our energy *crisis*. That's what we have now, a slow burning crisis that will not stop until we do something about it. As a result we also need:

* Tidal, solar and other renewable energy sources being used.

* Nuclear power; liquid thorium is supposed to be *the shit* but good old fashioned uranium will do.

*Make our manufacturing and goods transportation processes cleaner, more efficient and generally less wasteful. (I don't know about you, but I think we can do without a million cuddly mere cats being shipped over from china every year. Tax is one way of doing this, but it has to be global or people get all pissy about trade restrictions. Personally I think we should ban pointless shit from being moved around at all.

* Actually bothering to follow the international agreements we sign up to.

On a side point.

Try going to a jobcentre some time. I was on the dole for about a month and a half last Summer while my job (Echo Arena) had no events for me to work.

It actually took being in a shop and overhearing the manager discussing what to put on a 'help wanted' sign to get my current second job.

It's bloody disheartening - you're 28 and by the sound of it haven't really struggled with unemployment? I found it depressing enough when I actually had a job! Imagine those people who are 20 years older, no formal education, and are on the front line of people who are laid off whenever money is low. Having to deal with...not even rejection, because companies don't seem to be that decent, just complete silence - their entire lives. Yeah this is a sensationalised example but there are people that live like that, and people who have never had to deal with it dismiss them as lazy good-for-nothings who just want to sponge off the government.

As for facing reality, I've lost money before and come from a poor background, my life hasn't been roses and if it wasn't for an interest in electronics at the right time and the balls to start my own business, chances are I'd be about 30 miles up the road from him in a similar situation.

I'm very aware that his choices are limited. He still made the wrong choices. He should've looked into pawning his stuff first before doing something like that. He should've (and possibly may have) looked into borrowing money from other family members. If he'd pawned his things he might not have got all his stuff back but he would be £33 a month better off right now. He hasn't filed for bankruptcy, which he should consider doing if it's unlikely he'll get a job in the near future. Again, all the wrong choices. He may not have been told about such things and he might not have the nounce or access to information to learn.

If someone appeals or argues it has to be processed, noted down and recorded in figures. If people don't appeal then no-one will know there's a problem. I've never been on benefits myself, but I grew up in a family dependent on them. My mother was always looking for ways to get the most out of the benefits system so that she could give us a better start in life.

I'm glad we agree, if only partially on the point about him setting up his own business. I think a co-operative could work well if he can find others who are unemployed to join up. In my experience (as an employer) companies tend to reach a certain size and rarely create many new jobs after that point. It's the growing companies that create new jobs, and they tend to be younger companies.

The UK is one of the easiest countries I've been to for starting a business and the tax regime isn't that egregious. He will need capital to start up (and grants can go some of the way towards that) but his best bet would be to see what grants he can get and if there's any additional support he can receive to tide him over up until that first invoice comes in (I'm assuming he'd lose his JSA the minute he becomes a director, you seem to know the benefits system much better than I so if I'm wrong please say so).

People work in order to provide money, otherwise they would use the time as leisure. Right now the benefits system provides not much cash but a LOT of leisure. The minimum wage as it currently stands does not offer enough money to encourage people to start working - the resulting gain in cash is not equal to the value of the leisure people would lose in order to work.

This can be solved in 2 ways:

1) Make the financial reward from working higher. This could be done for instance with a reverse income tax (say you earn under £15,000 every pound you earn the government 'tops it up' with more cash) or allowing people to keep more benefits when they work.

2) Make benefits less appealing. If you cut benefits the relative gain from the minimum wage is higher incentivising people to work. Scheme could also involve making people do things for their benefits - cutting the amount of leisure time they have, again making the money incentive from working higher. 

Problem with solution 1 is that it is expensive, problem with solution 2 is that it increases inequality. ",0,1326720029,null,0,false,0,c3hpejg,t3_oj81c,t1_c3hpejg,t3_oj81c,null,1428188986,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Any drug that is used on humans has to undergo years of clinical trials; the process isn't perfect but peer reviewed scientific rigour is the best defence we have against nature.

A note on these type of jobs you seem to have missed from your wide experience. Most of the jobs for labourers, cleaning and care workers which you see around aren't taken for one reason: they end up paying you less than minimum wage. Which is why you see so many immigrants doing it.


A lot of the jobs aren't allowed on the job centre system for this reason. Most of the cleaner and carer jobs make you commute between sites unpaid. So you will be paid for the hour you spent cleaning Business A, and the hour you spent cleaning Business B. The 45 minutes it took you to get between them? Nope. Exactly the same with at-home carers who have to travel between clients. Not to mention the people without cars who can't do these jobs.


The Job Centre makes you sign up to recruiting agencies now for labourer work and follow what job offers you've been sent by them. The thing is there's a lot of out of work builders who are 30-40 year old ex-carpenters and ex-building site workers with valid CSCS cards. They also have to also apply for lowly labourer work or they lose their Job Seekers allowance. And guess what they get the work because they end up doing other stuff on-site too.


Furthermore you have picker-packer jobs which make up the main bulk of available jobs in poor areas from my experience and you can end up with a chance working there. What you'll find once you're there however in the less than lovely factories is people being expected to do unpaid work hours, no breaks, hours docked and a horrible work environment. For those reasons you'll see immigrants brought in by recruitment agencies as line managers know they won't say boo.


Many people do put up with shitty picker-packer jobs to elevate their situation but they know better than to just say it's people turning down jobs. A lot of them mug you over or have huge numbers of applications; job seekers follow you up now on your applications and can force you to approach businesses not just reply to adverts.

So I ended up on JSA for 2 weeks before I took a job a security guard, they laid me off and I immediatly picked up an industrial cleaning job while I applied for University.

I got in and I'm now studying business management, but since I started I had to move as driving to uni was too expensive and I took a job after 3 weeks at dominos pizza as a driver. It wansn't what I wanted to do, but I needed the fucking money to pay my debts. I was living on around £6 a week or £10 if the tips were good (they generally aren't)

I now work for Samsung and after 8 months I was promoted to regional manager. I'm still studying and working while making a nice living. I'm 24 at the moment. but I've worked my entire life and had to face some hard decisions but never once did I want to take money I hadn't earned myself.

Consider anti-vac people: For all their worries that their child will get autism or similar (unfounded, of course, if one looks at any decent trial (Yes, I'm ignoring Wakefield... funny that)) they're ignoring the very definite documented increased risk their and others' children from possible disease. Consider how many children died from these now preventable diseases only in the last 100 years, or even more recently. These vaccinations didn't suddenly pop out of nowhere, parents weren't suddenly forced to vaccinate their children. They came about through the hard work of medical practitioners, and similar, and because large numbers of people were dying, or being incapacitated. 

These people forget, or don't realise, that the modern world we enjoy, which is comparatively free of diseases that will kill us quickly and easily, is *not* the norm. The number of children who have died form measles etc. now is not insignificant. These could all have been prevented with the routine vaccination and without that practice then more children will die. It's happening as we speak.

Back to the issue at hand: I have a pet theory that nutritionists, herbal medicine advocates, homeopathy users etc. are a phenomena in 'rich' countries and amongst the middle classes. People who enjoy a good/high standard of life with not many worries and enough time on their hands to indulge their problems with non-standard methods.

Holistic medicine has taken off big time; and its a huge business the idea that medicine only works on the individual; maybe its related to the individualist philosophy of our age.

I remember Ben Goldacre stating that the only correlating factor between type 2 Diabetes, life expectancy, cancer rates and other health related issues is relative wealth. This is unsurprising; as some economists point to social ills in developed society being caused by wealth inequality.

An ex-girl friend once told me to shut up because I asked what the evidence for a homoeopathic therapy was when in a poncey middle class health store. The woman replied, in a rather condescending tone, ""I have been using the therapy in question for years and I've found it to be very effective"", my response was something ""I mean like records of success and failures of the treatment."" before I was interrupted and told off by the climate change denying ex (not that I'm bitter about it, i wish her the best) who wanted some sugar pills because she felt tired all the time. 

I also got into an argument with a woman who instructed my, type 2 diabetic, father to stop taking medicine prescribed to him as a doctor and was attempting to guilt him in to changing his lifestyle - for a comfort eater this doesn't seem like the best approach when he already swims 4 times a week and has become a de-facto vegetarian.

Ever since the more aggressive style of interview became en-vogue its as if every interviewer feels the need to be Day/Paxman and that the way to get the best out of an interviewee is by becoming interrogative. Modern interviewees are for more media-savvy and (especially political ones) better at avoiding direct questions, and you need to push them so that they don’t duck issues, but sometimes watching other interviewers I feel like they are one step away from cranking up the lights and getting out the rubber hoses. I’ve filmed a lot of TV interviews, and in my experience you get far more out of an interviewee when you get them to relax and open up rather than turning the whole thing into a ""who can make the cleverest jibe"" competition.

Sure, it would be nice to have another exciting Suarez-like striker or just another striker in general.

But I think that masks the problems that we have in midfield creativity:

* Downing has been inconsistent (or ineffective depending on whose side you're on).
* Same with Henderson.
* Charlie Adam has done ""okay"" compared to the other new signings but certainly not the Charlie Adam I saw playing for Blackpool and wanted for Liverpool.

Add that to Kuyt suddenly looking old, Maxi out of favor, I think we're suddenly seeing the importance of an aggressive, creative and versatile midfielder like Raul Meireles for our team. A player that could help free up Gerrard to do what he does best.

But ... it seems as if we're now looking at Gerrard to control the distribution in the midfield, deliver crisp crosses, power forward from the midfield to score goals, inspire the team, etc. etc.

Not the best way to maintain his health and elongate his career, I think.

Again, sure, we could use a striker. That would be nice. But in reality, the chances of getting an impact striker who can immediately perform on our first team in the Premier League is pretty slim.

They don't and wouldn't if we disbanded the monarchy. The crown estate is owned by the crown which in turn is owned by nobody as the embodiment of British sovereignty. It literally requires nothing more complicated than a legal fiction handing the crown off to something the state owns to resolve all questions as to ownership. Also this would fit within British tradition of doing weird things to work around the fact we're technically a monarchy. The great monarch coat hanger could fit alongside the Chiltern Hundreds as a great British piss take*. Even if we didn't do this the most likely result is still that the state gets the property.

It is a nice story but it doesn't fit reality. The only way we'd lose that revenue is if we handed them back the property as a good will gesture on the way out. Any lingering legal doubt is trivially dealt with. The estates are not handed back to the UK each time in anything other than a ceremonial sense. The monarch is explicitly not the owner. A huge part of the settlement was the change of ownership from explicitly belonging to the monarch to belonging to the crown.

I don't remember who said what beforehand, I was just responding to your claim in reply to me that pointing out people's ethnicity is bigoted. I absolutely don't think you're an EDL supporter, I think you're trying too hard to go in the opposite direction.

And the word 'all' was never used. I said 'most'. 'Most' Jews in Europe and the US are white. 'Most' Muslims are of Arabic or African descent, i.e. darker than the mean average skin tone. I didn't go on to make any judgement about either religion or set of ethnicities or races; I just stated an observable fact. It's not racist in and of itself. If it's followed by an anti-Islamic or anti-Semitic rant, then the rant is bigoted.

You call it racial stereotyping. I haven't given any stereotpe to a race. You could call it religious stereotyping, because I'm talking about generalisations within the religion, but they are not negative stereotypes (unless you yourself have a problem with white or black people), and it is certainly not a racist thing to say.

The average British person is white, is that racist? No, it isn't. If I follow it up with 'therefore, the white people in this country deserve more rights', then I'm crossing the line. Just because something can be used in a racist argument doesn't make it racist.

*The head also subsequently opens up to reveals a full human skull rather than just a brain, as was established in the Davies era*

As for the backstory:

*Eventually, the Doctor re-opened the breach, causing the Cybermen and Daleks (who had been saturated with background radiation from the Void) to be sucked back into it. The breach then sealed itself, leaving the Cybermen and Daleks (except the Cult of Skaro, who used their emergency temporal shift function to escape) seemingly trapped in the Void forever.*

and

*Due to events of the 2008 series finale, in which the Daleks' damaged the barriers between realities, the Cybermen were able to escape the Void, assisted by technology stolen from the Void-trapped Daleks.*

concluding with:

*The Cybermen to next appear in the Steven Moffat era of Doctor Who (2010—) are not clearly identified as being the same Cybermen which originated in the parallel universe or those of the native universe; they are merely presented to the audience as a space-faring species of cyborgs, though they are of the 2006 redesign. The first Cybermen appearance of this era was as the main antagonists of the video game Blood of the Cybermen. They were controlled by a Cyber Lord similar to the one featured in ""The Next Doctor"", and used Cybermats to convert people into Cyberslaves, mutating their flesh into metal. Their ship was damaged by a Time-storm and crashed 10,000 years before 2010 in the Arctic.*

S1 Episode 2 - worst villain of the show, not incredibly vital for character development. There's a call-back or two you'll be confused about if you skip it, but. eh.

S1 Episodes 4&amp;5 - also appallingly bad aliens. But if you skip these, you miss being introduced to a great recurring character.

S2 Episode 10 - Okay for 3/4, then it devolves into the single worst, cheesiest and most horrifying episode of Who I've seen. If you skip nothing else, skip this.

S3 Episodes 4 &amp; 5 - these aren't completely terrible, they're just cheesy and you have to deal with some terrible American stereotypes and bad makeup. Almost all of S3 is fantastic, these two episodes aren't.

S4 has no bad episodes, period.

Specials - The Next Doctor is pretty bad, Planet of the Dead is so-so at best. Neither adds that much to the show. The other ones are absolutely mandatory viewing.

S5 - Episodes 2 and 3 are pretty silly. Not atrocious, but certainly cheesy and not terribly relevant to anything.

You need to set out the legal framework of your argument and explain to the MP what avenues exist to overturn the legal judgement approving extradition.

Don't forget, an MP can't overrule a Judge - and quite rightly so.

MPs get loads of letters, and simply sending a ""woe, woe, woe"" letter without actually setting out a plan of action or making a specific request is going to struggle to get in-depth consideration.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Alternate construction methods can produce less noise but are more costly, such as vibrating a pile into the ground rather than hammering it. There are others but I forgot.

Another possibility is using a curtain of bubbles around the pile to provide insulation whilst pile driving. A third is to use a 'soft-start' where the hammer energy is initially relatively low and is increased over 20 minutes or so - giving marine mammals time to notice the sound and move away. Another is to use 'pingers' which emit a sound which is not harmful but is intended to scare off marine mammals. All of these are unproved though and could even attract dolphins and other whales (who are inquisitive by nature).

I don't know of any methods to reduce operational noise - it would have to focus on isolating the machinery from the foundation. The 'woosh' of air over the blades makes the noise you hear in air but this is reflected from the sea surface and contributes very little to the underwater noise. Instead it's the gears and other moving parts inside the turbine which cause vibrations down the shaft and into the water.

I don't know much about non-acoustic impacts but there could be several. One a positive note structures in the sea such as turbine foundations and oil platforms often form artificial reefs and thus can actually improve the local biodiversity.

The last point I'll make is that these impacts should be compared to those caused by extracting and burning oil and gas. They should not be a reason to stop development of offshore wind.

 First, small disclosure - I personally know some foreign guests who were invited on board the Britannia.

Why a royal yacht? As a method of transportation it is antiquated. It takes time to get anywhere, and practicality dictates that you now have fly the misc. royal to the yacht so as not to take too much time.

On the other hand, it is a mobile palace. You can send  carrier somewhere and it looks powerful, but you send a royal yacht and it has style. It is a mobile exhibition centre hosted by senior royals. People want to be invited on board in a way that a reception at an embassy can never equal. It is a mobile piece of the UK with a much greater presence than Airforce 1. 

Now onboard the ship. When we talk of the Britannia, it was the tightest run ship in the fleet. Every bit of brass polished up and every single propeller on the lifeboats are all in perfect alignment. It sounds anal and stupid but what it says is quality and an attention to detail (that these days is maybe unheard outside a German automotive factory).

Defoe is worth maximal 12 million£, and he is english, any half-way decent english is worth that much.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Eyewitness testimony is *notoriously* unreliable - I think about 70% of the death-row inmates who have been exculpated by DNA evidence in the last few years were originally identified by witnesses.

Jurors base credibility on how confident and forthright the witness appears on the stand, irrespective of factors such as lighting, distance and eyesight.

 I am writing to express my concern at the recent judgment concerning 23 year old student and British subject Richard O'Dwyer. Richard is threatened with extradition to the United States. Richard's alleged offence under US law was to develop and host a website where users could search for television shows to watch online.  The website did not store copyright material and simply directed users to other sites. For this, the United States authorities seek to extradite him and may do so under the Extradition Act 2003. This law is badly drafted and reflects a troubling disregard for the civil rights of British citizens. For example US officials have no obligation to present evidence held against the Richard and there is no provision in the treaty for UK judges to demand to see such evidence. The 'protections' in this legislation are so weak that there is scant ability to successfully appeal against extradition.

This lopsided piece of legislation diminishes our judicial system and empowers foreign courts. I understand that the Home Secretary has the final say over whether to extradite and I trust that you will act to put pressure to defend Richard from such a fate.

Regards etc...

When we first saw her in Silence in the Library, i had a small dislike for her due to her smugness, and acting as if she is the most important person to ever meet the doctor. as the 5th and 6th series went on, my dislike for her intensified. the constant ""hello sweeties"" and ""spoilers"" became annoying, and her sexual innuendoes were awkward and strange. My dislike turned to hatred when i saw her in Lets Kill Hitler.
She was so self obsessed and mary sue-ish . one minute [spoiler](/s ""wanting to marry the doctor"") the next [spoiler](/s ""killing him!"") She was obnoxious and obsessed with him when she was in school answering to the teachers, which made me want to throw my clicker at the TV. She did troublesome the things that were supposed to be badass and cool, but were just dumb and illegal. She didn't even care that [spoiler](/s ""her parents were about to die"") choosing to sit in a chair and mock the doctor.(I'm about to say a bunch of random stud that annoys me now) And the whole romance thing was way overdone and cliche. The doctor hates guns and violence, yet he doesn't care when she uses them. plus, she's a careless time traveler. Every single time she meets the Doctor, she whips out her magic journal and asks ""have we done this yet?"" giving the doctor information about his future that he shouldn't know. The Doctor is a very curious man(alien) who sometimes does things he knows he shouldn't, and she leaves a journal containing his future RIGHT NEXT TO HIM!!! she should know him enough not to do that. She is an obvious mary sue. i haven't seen TWoRS yet, but I'm sure i'm gonna like her even less. i just want her to go! sorry for the long comment, but i've been waiting to say this for awhile.

2. Be involved heavily in the campaigns for:  
a) Not fully withdrawing from the EU, but simply stop following their policies which are harmful to us. For instance, we enforce all of the EU regulation on farming, pushing the price of UK produce up, whilst other Eastern EU countries don't bother. The odds are we would be kicked out of the EU for these things, but if we formally declare and legislate the return of sovereignty to Westminster without pulling out ourselves, it can be a gradual and peaceful process.  
b) A similar situation with Scotland - an entirely independent and self-sufficient tax system and parliament, but staying part of the EU. Wales, Northern Ireland and England could be offered the same deal, and an assembly of delegates from Each country could attend a ""UK Cabinet"" meeting, so that the Union is maintained, but merely loosened.  

3. Encourage an increase in our electronics manufacturing industry, leading to an increase in jobs (particularly in the North). This could be done through the government subsidisation of UK-manufactured goods.  

4. Change the benefits system so that those who are capable of work but cannot/will not find any have a certain amount of community work to do to receive their benefits. This could be street cleaning, assisting road maintenance, or they could be taken on to work for charities. This would benefit all involved - many people who are long-term unemployed complain about a feeling of lack of purpose and worth, which this would solve. Equally, run-down areas would now have a huge number of people working to improve them. Also, those who are choosing to be unemployed may be less inclined to do so if benefits have to be earned.  

5. Hugely reduce the number of executives and ""suits"" in hospitals - redirect the funding to doctors, nurses and facilities.  

6. Increase trade links with Canada, the commonwealth and developing countries to deal with any loss of trade from not being part of the EU any more (which would be very little anyway.)  

7. Boost funding to medical and scientific research, and subsidise fees on more useful degrees, such as Engineering, Science, Medicine and others. Also, offer to pay of a percentage of the student loans of graduates who train to become teachers (on a side note, make it far easier to sack bad teachers).

(Sounds vague but I think most of you will immediately know what I'm on about... random example: a *real* anti-monopoly commission for starters, especially where the ""free"" press are concerned).

* As per the previous point (but worth stating separately), separation of church and state and immediate negation of any law with a religious basis (and a rational replacement if required).

* Begin the huge and long-term task of lobbying for a change in global economic policy to create a ceiling for maximum profit, creating a moderate post-capitalist free market where breaking even is acceptable (which successfully remunerates staff and shelters/fees/clothes families and allows them to prosper and well as kicking speculation and greed -  the two main problems with capitalism - in the balls).

* Ban the use of tractors on all roads for all time. (Joke. Sadly).

* Lobby for creation of a Europe-wide DC power grid.

* Lobby for (because the UK couldn't afford it by itself) creation of a REAL space exploration/exploitation program including an orbital funicular and remotely-operated drones. (This stuff is not scifi, it is what we must ultimately do as the resources:population ratio gets worse, not to mention the fact that as a species we lose by default when the Earth becomes unable to sustain us).

* Legislate to combat the 'patent wars' issues with R&amp;D which has been increasingly crippling human progress since the beginning of the data/information era.

* Legislate to prevent companies from removing 'objective advances' from the market (either via purchase or litigation) to protect their own profits, eg. oil companies crippling progress with automobiles that use other 'objectively better for our species on our planet' kinds of fuel.

I would consider expanding the military, not for foreign campaigns but domestically. It don't think it would be compulsory and certainly not armed but could help with social challenges we have and maintaining and repairing infrastructure. Troops are cheap too but part of their payment will be discipline.

I would abolish party funding, each political party gets a fixed budget. All politicians.have to effectively live a big brother lifestyle where there is constant scrutiny. As means of compensation I would double their wages and allow them full pay pension at retirement age so long as their employment after politics stood up at an ethics commity. 

I would retrospectively prosecute bankers who contributed to the crisis. Treasury officials, both politicians and civil servants would also be examined in relation to wreck less spending.

I would abolish minimum wage which effectively charity and would bring the average wage down. Companies would have to lower prices to remain competitive which would help to combat inflation. The drop in revenue from sales should offset the savings in wages so an equilibrium could be found.

I would look for a renegotiation of our fisheries and agricultural policy with Europe. As an island with such fertile waters and land its ridiculous that we can only fish in 20% of our waters and pay farmers not to produce. Whether or not they admit it the EU is a big fan of our contributions so they would listen. 

I would very seriously look into welfare reform but without seeing the books I can't comment further.

The same goes for the NHS. The bottom line is it stays but needs to be efficiency tested. If possible I would look into means testing useage ie. pissheads. The NHS is not there for that kind of use. Wasteful use mAy be charged.

I would abolish union membership in the education sector. Children are impressionable and it's dangerous to have a socialist ideology rammed down their throats. As seen with the student protests it's ridiculous to have teens who have never known anything BUT a labour government parading through London chanting 70s and 80s anti Tory slogans. They were right to protest but what I saw first hand was out and out indoctrination which I remember from my student days which at the time I didn't notice. 

I would look at creating low tax enterprise zones similar to docklands across the country in cities which need a boost like Liverpool/ Belfast/ Glasgow/ Cardiff/ Newcastle so the country isn't so dependant on London.

I would look to return RBS to being a retail bank, cut off the invest shell and sell assets to fund green investment.

I will be controversial here, I will keep student fees but scrutinise unis which charge the full amount. I think students need to get absolute bang for their buck and unis need to cut down on numbers.

In line with green investment I would encourage school leavers to take engineering placements rather than wasting time and money on mickey mouse degrees. The emphasis should be on quality not quantity.

These movies exist in their own shared universe with no Time Lords and no regeneration.


The other version of the character is a Time Lord who travels in a Type 40 TARDIS and has regenerated into 11 different guises, each leading directly to the next (save 8th-9th, though producers have said there are no regenerations between and Eccleston's is the 9th version). These TV series and one TV movie exist in a separate shared universe where ""The Doctor"" is a face-changing Time Lord and ""Doctor Who"" is just a clever title for the program.

TL;DR: Cushing's is a different character with similar characteristics in a separate continuity. Human; never regenerated into anyone else.

Similarly, I've disliked River Song ever since we met her, barring one brief flash of sympathy when [spoiler](/s ""she gets her Doctorate, and the Kovarian turned up, and her face just fell."")

She (and he) are just so utterly, insufferably, conceited - they both put themselves up so high that I'm rooting for anyone to knock them down a peg.

I DO like Donna on the other hand - I've been watching her episodes again recently, and she is in no way as distasteful as those two.  Her brashness is born of a desire not to be left behind - she's dealing with the mad, insane and wonderful worlds of the Doctor in a completely understandable way - by defending herself with attitude.

Amy and Rory I can take or leave, poor Martha never seemed to get much personality to work with (though I liked when she made the Doctor stop and describe Gallifrey), Rose was a perfect example of a construct and I just went with it.  [spoiler](/s ""Old, abandoned, Amy"") was interesting in her episode, Astrid Peth and Abigail Pettigrew were simply sympathy button pushers.  I didn't like Mikey to start with, but he grew on me.  Wilfred was lovely, and particularly amazing in Turn Left.  Madame de Pompadour was ok, but the Doctor was far more impressed by her than I was.

true,teeuncouthgee,null,null,"I don't know if this contributes to people's dislike of her or not, but one of the major differences that Moffat's ladies have to RTD's is their lack of ordinariness. 

What adventuring does for Rose, Martha and Donna is show them the value already there in their individual, ordinary lives - e.g. Donna's fear of underachieving is shown to be unfounded when she saves the world through ""super-temping"". It's not meeting the Doctor that makes them important; they were extraordinary people in their own right, and the Doctor just brings it out in them. 

It is suggested that the Doctor has as much to gain from their ordinary lives as they do from his extraordinary one; that life among the stars (much like the Doctor himself) is a mysterious and dangerous thing in addition to being amazing, to which humans bring a little bit of warmth and joy. This is why RTD's companions were such great foils for the audience - instead of just being escapism, it encouraged the idea that our ordinary human lives are special and valuable to science-fiction just as science-fiction is valuable to us.

Amy and River don't have the backstories and ties that previous companions had. Since childhood and conception respectively, they had been a part of the Doctor's world and all its dangers. River's strengths aren't everyday qualities like bravery or wit, but rather knowhow, gunfights, and technology - she knows how to fly the TARDIS, put on hallucinogenic lipstick, and break into banks. Even Amy, the girl-next-door, had her family swallowed by monsters (kinda) before she even met the Doctor. She then spent all of her developmental years pining for him. 

Because they belong more to the Doctor's world than ours, neither of them represent humanity like the previous companions did, and this is what I miss the most from Russell T Davies.",0,1326784390,null,0,false,0,c3hzu4j,t3_ojwhj,t1_c3hzu4j,t3_ojwhj,null,1428194047,20,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,20

The new plans will allow for 27.000 more bums in seats, which is one of the major things football is about. That allows for more ticket revenue. It will also be a stadium fit to host a Champions League final or matches during a World Cup or Euro competition. The 18.5000 new ""Kop"" is an increase by 6.000 seats compared to today. Maintaining the single tier design will make it the biggest, most awesome and fearsome wall of people in football anywhere in the world.

It would be rather nice to get some more income to the club, and to increase the capacity. It would be nice if this also makes it easier for fans to actually obtain tickets without having to resort to the black market, or white market scams like Steve Perryman that essentially re-sells tickets at a 150% mark-up. Selling naming rights? Why the hell not? Does it generate enough money to bring in a new £20M-30M face to the team ever so often, then I really don't mind if one end of the stadium is named ""golden dash Pallace dot com stand"" (Or alternatively ""Carlsberg main stand - Probably the best stand in the world"").

Alternatively we can stay in a stadium that seats 45.000 people, with absofuckinglutely no realistic option for expansion, sitting on fundaments from the sixties in some areas, without generating fresh income in any form or way, and being 100% dependent on the occasional competition win bonus and cash injection from owners, while the competition is raking in more cash than us, and thus get a competition advantage that grows for each season.",0,1326789690,null,0,false,0,c3i0d8s,t3_ok4ad,t1_c3i0d8s,t1_c3hxr27,null,1428194297,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

What debate? It's a legal contract that grants specific rights under the law.

We've had civil unions now for 6-7 years, which is kind of like a trial run for gay marriage, nothing has shifted in our society since they came in.

It's about time that the restriction to only have civil unions for gay couples were done away with and gay people given the full legal protection of marriage in a way that can't be taken away from them in the future, but no this guy wants to continue to deny people their rights so he can have a reasoned debate which has no reasonable arguments against it.

A bit of history for younger readers...

Broadly speaking, within the past 40-odd years, Labour has been pro-gay rights and the Conservatives have been anti. It was a Labour MP who proposed the bill that decriminalised gay sex in the 60s and the Labour Party who introduced most of the gay-rights legislation we have in the UK today. The Conservatives opposed a lot of this legislation and introduced anti-gay legislation of their own (Section 28 for instance). Now, post-New Labour and the raft of pro-gay legislation they brought in, Cameron has gone on the record as being pretty pro-gay. However, a lot of the old Tory guard are still in place, and let's not forget all the former Conservative MPs in the House of Lords.

So while Cameron is cool about gay rights, the Conservative Party as a whole tends to take the opposite view.

'Blink' is great to watch before Season 5 if you wish to skip Doctors 9 and 10 and watch the 11th.

true,kris_lace,null,null,"* Start 'project 2020'
* Project 2020 will be a finite closed city (but transparent to public)
* This test city/town will put into practice leading sustainable technology in areas such as; energy, agriculture, communications, systems organisation and automation.
* The city will provide all needs and wants to its community singularly from within the city - else - all external trade will be sustainable. e.g. If intel CPU chips are needed for computers in this town then the chips will be ordered for quality and upon purchase the system will be accountable for them. This includes tracking them and dealing with the disposal and recycling them.
* Jobs will be delegated by a community voting system. There will be an appeals system in place and a dedicated tracker/inquiry handler. 
* However jobs will not be the main focus as many of the test features will be to test automated systems which do not require humans.
* There will be a multinational presence of researchers and leading skill-set demographics for all parts of the system. These research will thoroughly analyse and log (with the help of automated systems) their respective research. 
* There will be an opt-out clause for all volunteers as well as special requirement measure such as access to external healthcare and other emergency situations.
* An open source transparent security measure will be designed by the occupants in conjunction with leading researchers. This system will be a fall-back scape goat if required. Such punishments will be unique and will try out the latest research in rehabilitation. All defence of all charged will be in the form of asking questions to the prosecution system. Answers must be given to all questions, if an answer cannot be given it will be singularly investigated with help from a random selection of the population, community voting and the guide. Any answers to questions will be subject to judgement on actionable outcomes, such as further prosecutions, pardoning or a change in rehabilitation, imprisonment etc. 
* A delicate and careful behavioural guide will be in place. This will echo many practical rules and laws mirrored in most religions. This guide will represent religion but not replace it. A non-intrusive system will be in place to log how people adapt to these guides. There will be a democratic system to instil and recommend new guides. This guide will be a non assuming - non biased (toward specific beliefs) explanation of many 'problems' a typical human will encounter. These problems (like stories from religious texts) will not explicitly teach *one* solution - but will describe different outcomes and their effect on all involved. The person can chose to follow any solution they wish and this guide will be taught (to a degree) and encouraged - but not forced.
* Workshops for all kinds of things will be abundant and set up by the population liaising with experts. Featured workshops will be put forward by researchers for the test such as meditation, self well-being, self reflection and other kaizen constructs. 
*  Project 2020 will NOT use an internal monetary system. Money and currency will be scrapped entirely. All monetary interactions with external systems will be discouraged, scrutinised and factored into the research. 
* All persons will be able to engage in free speech. Persons will be encouraged to do so with considerations of the guide. 
* The city will be run by systems theory. All systems will be self similar and generic, an overall system will be in place. This 'system' will be digital information representing the town/city. All systems will be closed - meaning all waste and interaction with other systems but be in balance. For example if someone wished to fuel a motor vehicle, they must be responsible (inherently) for all consequences of this including waste. This waste will not be approved unless able to facilitate another system or be disposed of in a way in which doesn't fault the system. Situations where this will be an issue will take a ""small to many"" approach. Where either the design or implementation will start small and only incorporate that which adheres to the system. 
* The political structure will be a scientific panel (with specific experts on all levels of the system) these will be called 'servants to the public'. They will literally serve the public and all actions will be scrutinised but to a degree that punishment does not restrict enginuity. This panel will be accompanied by a voted representative group who will be given agendas voted for by the population. These will be fed into an efficient transparent system which will put 'questions' to the experts to which they must reply. If the reply leaves an actionable conclusion then it will be implemented gingerly. Not all questions will have answers and such states will be declared for all to see. All stakeholders will have access to a system which puts suggestions to the issues. 
* Because of the transparent nature of the governing systems - it will be prone to exploitation. This is what allows people to change it which is intentional. However a careful eye will thoroughly watch the process with emphasis on community psychology and how people ace to change things. Revolutions, coups, private groups with agendas come into this category.  
* The system will be under constant maintenance by designers. A process much like software updates, patches and hot fixes will be in place to tackle new requirements. New information, requirements and solutions are expected to happen often and will be tackled by designers. All systems will rely on other systems where a system is limited because of one system a flag will occur which will require ongoing monitoring at certain prompts. This flag will also (automatically) flag up if any immediate system has been changed - if it effects that flag (conflict) then it will be reviewed and implemented in the next version of the system.


Project 2020 will require external interaction at first. However the idea would be to publish the results in an open source strictly transparent nature to the world and scientific community. From here the other countries can jump in - this will exponentially tackle the resources and trade issues and negate reliance on external systems. Because of the inherent nature of the systems approach - it will be fully adaptable and easy for others to implement. One of the research aims will be to address the human condition.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"Actually, when it comes to tablets the iPad represents a pretty good value for money. Sure you can pick up Shenzhen special for £100 or so, but it's not going to work as well if at all, and will have zero support. My Android tablet was around the same price as an iPad 2, but until they released the ICS upgrade the software was crap compared to iOS. And even now, I would say the iPad (hardware, OS and ecosystem combined) has the edge. HC was at best a beta, and frankly not worth spending money on. And my experiences with Google/OEM support have been shitty at best.

As for where a tablet fits into the business, they do have distinct advantages over laptops. If all you need to do is read documents and send a few emails they are far better, especially if your traveling. You won't be able to type out a report on one, that's something a laptop is far better at, but for people who do a lot of meetings they have solid advantages. Think of it as something that works with a laptop and smartphone rather than something which can replace either of them.

Also, when looking at cost you have to look a the the TCO of an iPad, rather than comparing the TCA of a stack of iPads against the cost of a printer, as you need to factor in the cost of buying toner, paper, envelopes, paying postage and having staff to mail it out. 

But I won't disagree that it's quite likely they went for them because they were cool, what I am suggesting is that in the right environment an iPad is a good business tool and not simply a toy.

Adidas is a massive brand that is already established, the Warrior/Newbalance guys are trying to develop there football brand and gain market share so their return on investment required is likely lower than Adidas' and thus they priced them out of renewing with Liverpool.
