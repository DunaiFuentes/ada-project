When he landed he called the head of wardrobe he sheepishly admitted that he had mentioned that he'd be filming Doctor Who to one of the airline attendants. Slightly worried but not outright panicking she told him that it would be alright and telling one person wasn't that bad.

Until the taxi he took dropped him off in Cardiff... at the wrong studio. To which he went up to the front desk and said ""Hello, I'm Timothy Dalton, I'm here for the fitting for Doctor Who"".

The biggest problem that was developing under RDM was our lack of consistent possession, even against weaker sides. This happened for two reasons, first - no presence up front (striker). Second, I honestly think players were buying into the early season hype and trying to play too cute and/or too quickly. This meant that we were often losing the ball at inopportune times, leaving our defence strained.

So far under Rafa we've been defensively solid. Moving Bane inside in the absence of Terry has been smart. He plays there for Serbia as captain and brings a stability that the Cahill/Luiz pairing never had. We also lose nothing with Azpi slotting in at RB.

We also did better with possession today, that I can't really explain though.

We got in behind them time and again but chose the wrong pass/shot, the supporting players didn't provide the right option, or the pass or shot was mis-hit. And gave up two goals, one from poor defending by Downing, one from a weird (deflected?) free kick.

Thought spurs were pretty shit apart from Bale really. Swansea were more impressive. This was there for the taking.

The worst refereeing decision was for the free kick, in fact they won a bunch of free kicks around the box by just falling over when a liverpool player touched them. Contact doesn't necessarily make it a foul, and for henderson/dempsey it definitely wasn't. The pens could have been given, but they were no where near as clear cut as the ones from early in the season.

Individually, most of the players were a mix of good and bad.

Gerrard had a very poor start, he was beaten way too easily in midfield for their first goal and gave up another chance with a mistake but after that he had a good game.

Enrique has a great attitude and movement but his execution wasn't that good today. Still definitely worth keeping in that position though.

Henderson was decent apart from the miss but was having a bad patch before he was subbed. The Dark Lord did pretty well and it was nice to see Gerrard not taking corners and actually ON THE END OF ONE.

Downing playing was a mistake. If Bren didn't want Wisdom against Bale, he could have played Robinson instead of Downing. Robinson is a better left back than Downing.

Enrique, whilst very good at getting forward with his marauding runs, and decent at playing through balls, isn't an attacker. This is proven when he gets in the box with the ball and he has no idea what to do with it.

Downing....well Downing isn't anything. He's just....Downing. I get the feeling that he is embarrassed by how shit he is.

Sterling, despite having tremendous potential, should **NOT** be playing **EVERY** game for us. He doesn't even get taken off towards the end of games. The kid is playing against grown men, he must be knackered.

Allen doesn't deserve to start. He gives away numerous, needless fouls right on the edge of the box, and his passing (despite never actually being adventurous with it) keeps on finding opposition players. He's also only had ONE shot all season. I fail to see what he offers when the team isnt winning. Yet he keeps a world class, Real Madrid player on the bench. Sahin must be pulling his perfectly combed hair out.

Gerrard keeps on getting caught in possession, I think he lost the ball for their first goal. And his legs no longer allow him to rectify those mistakes like he used to. I still believe Gerrard can play a role though, but only in a midfield that consists of Lucas &amp; Shelvey/Sahin. With Henderson &amp; Allen he is trying to do too much because he realises the other two will do fuck all themselves.

Suarez, I feel, will be gone in the summer. He is too good for our team and must be going mental with the fact that he has to do everything himself. I actually feel sorry for him because he quite clearly cares so much. If we can get £50m-£60m for him, and Rodgers can invest the proceeds wisely, it might actually not be a bad thing. Hear me out.

There is a general perception that the right-wing want a smaller government, but that is not an automatic bias towards private provision. Indeed, look at the USA and you will see that it is actually a surprisingly state-heavy provider of services in a very localised framework.

You can quite easily have a tax-payer funded service delivered by private companies as you can by state-owned companies under both left and right ideologies.

* Spend an extra 40% on defence annually, another 1% of GDP.
* Expand the Army by 25% to 125,000 personnel and to double the size of the Territorial Army.
* Restore responsibility for overseeing the UK 
banking system to the Bank of England (BoE), 
which must remain independent.
* Introduce better pay, conditions and medical 
care for the British Armed Forces personnel 
and their families
* These Boards will be made up primarily of healthcare professionals who will be elected by the county’s voters **every four years** in the manner of local council elections.
* to take part in council-run local community projects called ‘Workfare’ schemes
* Fully support the monarchy, oppose 
disestablishment of the Church of England, 
and consider transferring part of the Crown 
Estate back to the Royal family in return for 
ending their State support

FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt):

* Former New Labour staff maintain that this policy has been a deliberate attempt to water down the British identity and buy votes. 
* End mass, uncontrolled immigration.
* Save the UK from a potentially ruinous 
pensions burden by leaving the EU
* immediate halt to unjustified spending 
on renewable sources that has led to massive 
energy price hikes and fuel poverty
* Influence housing demand, not just supply. 
Only by leaving the EU can Britain regain control of its borders and control immigration. (This in the housing section? ""Tuk our jerbs! Tuk our Houses!!"")
* By controlling immigration, large areas of British countryside will not 
need to be destroyed
* Recognise the numerous threats to British 
identity and culture

Meaningless cliches:

* reduce NHS waste and bureaucracy
*  bring in private sector efficiency

Bread and circuses:

* £130 a week for all pensioners aged 65 
and over. There will be no reductions for those 
with personal savings or a private pension.

Dumb fuckery:

* UKIP accepts that the world’s climate changes, 
but we are the first party to take a sceptical 
stance on man-made global warming claims. 
* Oppose wind farms in general
* Invest in an enhanced and safer road network, building new bypasses and widening 
major roads
* promotes uniculturalism
* including British 
inventions and Britain’s role in fighting 
slavery and Nazism

true,senordirector,lfc68,,"I disagree, but I won't downvote you - you took the time to contribute.

The more I think about it, the less sense Rodger's tactics make; we had no defensively minded fullbacks (in position) but were playing against a team with Lennon and Bale on the flanks and Defoe in attack - this would only have been barely acceptable if Lucas was playing, which would give us something like 3 vs 3 on a counter, instead, it was always 2 vs 3.

I initially thought that having Downing and Enrique swap made sense; both would not be so eager to get forward (one is a defender by nature, and the other... just doesn't), meaning that they wouldn't be so far out of defense - it also means that both of Tottenham's flanking players would have to stay back, alleviating immediate pressure on our defense. It even make more sense if you consider that we aim to play most of our games in the opposite half (all the fullback/winger has to do is make sure that they cover for one another).

However, this brings me back to my first point, the logic for playing Enrique up front is that he wants to SCORE ALL THE GOALS(!) (which we desperately need) but this means he is always forward, leaving Downing exposed (which lead to the first goal), this is made more obvious by how secure we were in the 2nd half - when the roles were reversed. I also think Downing played better in the last half; he held on to the ball well and contributed to build up play - he also made a couple of good chances - but no one is ever in the fucking box.

We dominated for nearly 60 minutes, but we have no way of converting good play into goals.

There are a few things that we need to realize. I know we need a stiker asap, but our midfield is what is costing us games now. We can't retain possesion of the ball and we lose it too fast.

It is clear that Gerrard needs to sit on bench for a couple of games. Allen should be replaced by Lucas when he gets back, and maybe Allen can finally play on the position he likes to play. As to the remaining spot on the midfield, I think either Shelvey or Shain need to take it. I think we need someone else to this position. Henderson is doing OK, but I don't think we can't take it to the end of the season... We need some class here (João Moutinho).

As for our strikers, Suarez and Sterling are great, and need to play every game. I don't like seeing Enrique playing so up the field like that. I know he has the heart and the will to do good, but he's not good enough to play as a winger.

The frozen food section - OMG! - I've never seen so much frozen produce. Frozen kebabs? WTF?

The thing is that the fresh food section in British supermarkets is awesome! You guys have a fantastic range of stuff, but there is just way too much sugar in all the other food.

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; I understand what you're saying, but a two state settlement along the 1967 borders means that Hamas has no intention of trying to reclaim the land if Israel will agree to it.

I don't think that follows. It's kind of like Hitler and Czechoslovakia or whatever - Hamas can agree to something without giving up their overall goal of greater expansion. Remember the kind of group we're talking about - unflinchingly violent, glorify suicide bombings, radically religious. I believe it is somewhat naive to assume Hamas will give up their charter and the goals thousands have died for just because both sides got a 1967 border agreement/plan. 

&gt;  Agreeing on and respecting borders would be a very big step towards peace, if both sides will do it.

I agree, but I think this must come first. And hamas is still demanding Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state (Israel will never agree to this)..and Israel is likewise making demands Hamas won't swallow. 

That's why I think setting up a state before peace has been signed is just muddying the waters. Especially when you're talking about a group like hamas.

I believe the whole Leverson inquiry and report has been skewed by the Aunt Sally cries of ""press regulation"".

It is not ""press regulation"" to stop people, be it workers in news institutions or outsourced from them, from hacking phones without any consent for profit, or ""the press"" having ""special meetings"" or chats with top public officials or the police without transparency, and more.

I fear ""the press"" and politicians have done an amazing job on the public on clouding the idea of what the report was meant to investigate and deliver.

**EDIT:** What I believe will most likely happen is that the Press Complaints Commission will have more strength and bite, especially in finding out / red-flagging how information was obtained from people filing complaints to them and more stronger fines for (some vague term of) ""unprofessional"" journalism.  
There would probably be a call for news institutions (maybe not politicians) to have a fully transparent working practice or code of conduct and strict deviation from it will be penalised. This would be drawn up by different independent observers, companies, and politicians somehow.

Basically, I don't think much will change at all, but ""the press"" will use it as a way to get their ""customers"" (consumers?) on their side, when in fact, it gives more rights to them (customers).

Smokers can still smoke, outside, and shouldn't be treated as a special case. It also relies on the capitalist dogma of private property.

&gt; This isn't the same as the old boss

It is. Pro-militarism and the longing for a Great British empire is there in the manifesto if you read between the lines. They also want to throw generous welfare at the armed forces. You can't be pro-peace whilst expanding the fascist warrior class at home and continue their undeserved elevated social status ahead of commoners.

&gt; Are any of the other parties proposing this? (royal family)

The monarchy would be an old boss. It is obscene to expand the financial clout of this anachronism by any modern standard. 

&gt; Immigration... How is this based on fear?

Immigration is neither mass nor uncontrolled.

&gt; Immigrants do actually live in houses. It seems to me if you reduced immigration and therefore housing demand there would be a greater and cheaper supply. Is this incorrect?

A gross over simplification. House prices are more affected by bad banking practices, rich economic migrants that like to park ""their"" assets in London stock, and a certain class of people (eg the monarchy) having a monopoly over land. That takes me back to the obscenity of earlier.

&gt; You don't think that would genuinely help them?

Not all need it, and this is most likely buying votes. There's a sweetener for most voters but their overall policy is retrograde to the non-incumbents. We've had throwing money at monarchy, pensioners and the armed forces.

&gt; Oppose wind farms in general

This is a stupid short sighted policy and harmonises with the idea that UKIP is a party fo the landed gentry. I think the only firm conclusion I can draw is not enough data. In principle wind is all about the up front costs, opposed to the lockin design of fuel based or those that need heavy decommissioning. The other is UKIP idolising nuclear which I find irresponsible. They also want to expand the road network. Bicycle is not mentioned anywhere that I have read, not in any meaningful way.

So pro-car, pro-nuclear (centralisation), pro-BoE (centralisation), pro-monarchy (centralisation), pro-military (centralisation), whilst wanting to re-Britishistify Britain and explaining away all the systemic ills of our socio-economics by decoupling from those horrid euro fascists.",0,1354189409,null,0,false,0,c78j3xf,t3_13xbss,t1_c78j3xf,t1_c78iv09,null,1430530912,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Kelley Temple, NUS Women’s Officer, said: “It appears to be… exploiting the fact that women students are in dire financial situations in pursuit of an education.”

This business is preying on people's *perception* of their money issues, rather than the *reality* of them.  It's all about fear of fees and the word 'debt' rather than the actual financial burden students face.  If we called it a grant and graduate tax, the financial 'burden' would be no different, but people wouldn't worry about it.

You get a loan to cover 100% of the your fees, and ~~almost always also to cover your accommodation and other living expenses~~ go a long way towards covering your accommodation fees.  These loans are paid back only on income after the first £21,000 a year, so even on a salary of £30,000 you pay back only £810 a year.  It's quite easily the single cheapest loan you will *ever* come across, and comes with zero risk of not being able to afford it.  The 'burden' on the student, because of the loans, is virtually non-existent.

Students are being tricked into thinking things are worse than they are - nobody needs to find £15,000 a year to attend university.  The most you need is a regular, boring, part-time job at a bar, shop, or supermarket to fund your socialising.

--edit--

The argument can easily be made that the loans should be bigger, or that the earnings threshold should be higher, but I really don't understand how any vaguely rational person can be so vehemently opposed to the *principle* of the current system.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"It seems to me that asking the press to self regulate is a complete nonsense, because the immediate incentives are so strong, for journalists to get stories, and for the press to sell more papers. Self regulation is a fig leaf, and the fact that this is their 'last chance' to shape up is meaningless, because they are always at ['the last chance saloon'](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/conditional-reprieve-for-the-lastchance-saloon-cleaned-up-its-act-1591946.html). These inquiries and reports have happened before, many times, and their recommendations have always been ignored. I also think that politicians' rhetoric about protecting investigatory journalism are insincere, because otherwise why is there still no public interest defence for libel?

Ultimately, the problems arise from the broken state of the English judicial and criminal justice system. If someone has been harassed by the press, or has evidence that the press are involved in other criminal wrongdoing, they always have to go through a single, narrow path, through the police and the CPS. If either of those organizations are bent (as the police were) any investigation can be shut down without too much fuss.

Firstly, there should be a strong police regulator which could hold the police to account, because at present the IPCC is toothless, doesn't even have its own investigatory staff, and therefore relies completely on the police. Secondly, there must be some overlapping capability to get access to the criminal courts, perhaps that police services can operate in each others territory, with a remit for investigating where another police service has failed, and perhaps there could be some 'investigatory magistrate' system so that everything doesn't have to go through the CPS.

Also, the civil courts would normally operate as a secondary way to get redress, but the costs are so enormous that they're completely out of the range of normal people, and essentially the civil court system is reserved for oligarchs, or at least the top few percent of the population. One way around that would be to allow people to band together in joint action, and / or to reduce potential liabilities (so that newspapers cannot deliberately hire punitively expensive lawyers to increase the compensation which would be required of the litigant should they lose).

But all of this represents a root and branch, fundamental reform of the police and justice system, and I don't see any appetite to do such a thing. In absence of these reforms, victims of media libel or harassment will inevitably be mistreated unless there is some form of statutory regulation.

I expect that nothing meaningful will be done, the government will introduce a rebranded self regulation system, and everything will be back to the good old days within a year or two.",0,1354193166,null,0,1354653948,0,c78jjzm,t3_13zk0i,t1_c78jjzm,t3_13zk0i,null,1430531152,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This is no different than sectors dealing with hazardous waste having the moral responsibility to provide a safe environment for all concerned. Smokers can still smoke, outside, and shouldn't be treated as a special case. It also relies on the capitalist dogma of private property.

You do not have to work in a pub that you don't want to and they're not even advocating a totally smoking pub but simply a room. The employee probably wouldn't even have to go into that room if they didn't want to. 

&gt;It is. Pro-militarism and the longing for a Great British empire is there in the manifesto if you read between the lines. They also want to throw generous welfare at the armed forces. You can't be pro-peace whilst expanding the fascist warrior class at home and continue their undeserved elevated social status ahead of commoners.

The militarism of getting out of the wars with the overall money that would save is entirely different the relocating some funds to the genuinely well intentioned armed forces who thought they were there to protect the country. The key point is they are not overseas killing people, this is surely the main objective.  

&gt;It is obscene to expand the financial clout of this anachronism by any modern standard.

The monarchy already has insane levels of financial clout, a bit more money would be a drop in the bucket if it meant the end to their state funding which would be an incredibly symbolic move hopefully leading to their eventual abolishment.  

&gt;A gross over simplification. House prices are more affected by bad banking practices, rich economic migrants that like to park ""their"" assets in London stock, and a certain class of people (eg the monarchy) having a monopoly over land. That takes me back to the obscenity of earlier.

The net migration in Britain in 2011 was 239,000 &amp; 180,000 so far this year. Are you saying this has no bearing on housing and rental costs? 

&gt;Not all need it, and this is most likely buying votes. There's a sweetener for most voters but their overall policy is retrograde to the non-incumbents.

As the economy worsens more and more pensioners struggle with the basic pension, I'm pretty sure £130 would help many a whole lot and more than double what most of them get. 

&gt;This is a stupid short sighted policy and harmonises with the idea that UKIP is a party fo the landed gentry.

Many of those I see apposing wind farms are just average people living in the local area not wanting the countryside negatively impacted. These are not the aristocracy bemoaning the intrusion into their fox hunting land. 

You talk about landed gentry and condem the centralisation of power yet seem totally fine with an unrepresentative centralised political class imposing wind farms on the lowly public who don't want them in their area. 

&gt;So pro-car, pro-nuclear 

You complain about nuclear but fail to acknowledge direct financial burden that will be imposed on the already struggling public with greener alternatives. Maybe this economic climate is not the best time for such a costly change. 

&gt;pro-monarchy (centralisation)

You don't see that stopping state funding is actually a progressive step. 

&gt;pro-military (centralisation)

You ignore that they hope to end all foreign conflicts and you don't differentiate between being for the members of the military in general &amp; pro-military industrial complex war racketeering which the rest of the parties engage in leading to millions of deaths.

You don't expand the military for them to sit around playing solitarie. Notice everything has to be cut, but the military.

&gt; The monarchy already has insane levels of financial clout, a bit more money would be a drop in the bucket if it meant the end to their state funding which would be an incredibly symbolic move hopefully leading to their eventual abolishment.

This is worthless as an argument. Chernobyl is already fucked, lets use it to dump more waste. A truly progressive statement would be land redistribution.

&gt; You talk about landed gentry and condem the centralisation of power yet seem totally fine with an unrepresentative centralised political class imposing wind farms on the lowly public who don't want them in their area.

And now a straw man. I criticised the party for being kneejerk anti-wind, automatically pro-nuclear, and global warming sceptics.

&gt; You don't see that stopping state funding is actually a progressive step.

That's remarkable spin. Yes, lets stop state funding for the military by turning the country into a military dictatorship. Let's dissolve parliament and give the monarchy ownership of all people and land, that way they will not be dependent on hand outs.

With regards to Lloris, i think it's just a stylistic change. Lloris is a very traditional goalkeeper in the ""continental style."" In England/America, you're taught as a goalkeeper to try to catch everything you possibly can; that smothering rebounds is almost as important making saves. The way Lloris was taught is very different; its about one simple rule; keep the ball away from the net by any means necessary. I've heard numerous times now where the commentators make jibes about Lloris as a goalkeeper because he chooses to palm a shot over the bar they think should have been caught, or chooses to punch away a long ball into the box they think he should have held onto despite the on-rushing player. 

The bottom line on Lloris is that he's just a very different style of keeper than we've had in a very long time; our last 3 keepers (stretching back to the early aughts) have all been ""catching"" style keepers; Friedel, Gomes, Robinson. He's very, very good, but he's going to give up more rebounds and such.  He's also just a very aggressive keeper, which, honestly, is something we need with our high back line.

You have a pretty good chance of getting killed while tailgating in general, regardless of whether you're behind a truck or a prius, but people do it anyway. I learned last year that in Georgia, tailgating seems to be the official state sport. If you put two cars on an otherwise empty multi lane superhighway, one will carefully tailgate the other. It's crazy. Myself, I will just start slowing down until they change lanes or I reach 35mph. (I'd slow to 10mph but generally that's not legal.) If they're too stupid to have stopping distance, I don't want them ramming into me at high speed if I have to make an abrupt stop. (In other words, I'm not slowing down for the purpose of annoying them, I'm doing it because that's the only safe speed with somebody trying to crawl up my ass.) 

&gt; where was this that they acted like that?

Somerville, Medford, Everett, and Revere Massachusetts. Drivers here have a bad reputation - they're generally known as ""Massholes"" - but I've found that relative to drivers in a lot of other places I've been (Rhode Island, Georgia, and Florida especially come to mind) they're actually usually relatively safe drivers.

The show is about change, first and foremost. And from there it's about progression and growth after change. Even though Tennant was a great Doctor, to have him come back would be a submission to nostalgic viewpoints, as well as some bizarre writing. It would be completely against what the show is about.

Tennant himself understands this, as it was his choice to leave the show when he did. He's been a fan all his life. I think he would actually be against the idea of the 10th Doctor becoming the 12th somehow.

Also, this is just my own perspective on the Tennant-return proposal (which has been brought up before), but I feel like it's very rude/inconsiderate to Matt Smith who has been and is still The Doctor. Our Doctor. Regardless of whether you prefer him or Tennant (or even Eccleston), he deserves that much respect and recognition. 

To say that it would be great for Tennant to come back as 12 is almost saying it would be great if he could ""take the show back"". I know this really boils down to fandom, and I don't say that in a mean or condescending way at all, but I honestly feel let down by others of this community when I see people basically saying they want to undo what Smith has done with the role and get back to ""traditional ways"" with Tennant.

University ultimately serves two uses, its demonstrates your capability of advanced learning (e.g. discipline, reading and writing ability etc), and it provides you with knowledge (that may be of importance in the workplace (e.g engineering, law etc).

Employers generally do not think a 2-4 hour a week course on ""lesbian pottery and its effect on roman-saxon art"" is going to really demonstrate that to a high degree.

Generally those that do, it will be in a very very niche field and has almost no transferability.

In terms of door openings, liberal arts and associated subjects open very very few, thinks like law the hard sciences etc, open many many more.

Ironically though it seems in terms of intellectual snobbishness, the liberal arts etc (from my experience) seems to value their knowledge skill as more vital. e.g. being ill-informed of evolution or the relationship of gravity (1/r^2), is never as derided as being artistically or historically ill informed.

Why?!?!?!?!!?!!  If it was me invited into either of those meetings I'd blab the lot, instantly. Largely because if I had that audience with RA then I'd like to communicate the method to his madness to fellow Chelsea fans - regardless of whether or not I thought it made sense and would explain mant things to fellow fans or was utterly insane.

I also find it nigh on impossible to believe that Abramovich, Tenenbaum, Buck or anyone else in the hierarchy would share *anything* with those fans unless they were prepared for the possibility of it being splashed across the back page of The Sun the next day. Which entirely rules out any possibility of them discussing a managerial juggernaut, or any incoming transfers. 

The OP doesn't want to publish what was said by Roman in private. Why? Why would you go to lengths to describe the meeting without actually adding any content to it? I largely suspect it's because the responses contained absolutely no juicy 'insider info' nor were they enlightening in the slightest. 

I work in PR, I have done for 15 years. This is nothing more than a PR exercise undertaken by the club to placate a handful of fans in the knowledge that news of the ‘Audience with Roman’ would spread, giving fellow Chelsea fans hope that he ‘is listening’ and ‘cares’ about what we think. It has told us absolutely nothing, given us no insight into RA’s thoughts, the running of the club…. Nothing.

That post might as well have been titles ‘OMGWTF I had an audience with Roman Abramovich LOL!!!!!111!!!1’ with absolutely no content within it – we’d have harvested the same amount of ‘intelligence’ about the club from such a post.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I was left frustrated by this result.  We didn't play our best stuff by any stretch, but I really think we should have gotten more out of it.

Enrique looks good as a winger, but he's missing a bit of attacking instinct.  In particular the header he tried to nod down for Henderson stuck out to me.  He had a poor angle to the goal but I would have been much happier to see him try to head for the far post (or on goal at all) in that situation. 

Suarez is just a handful, he's an absolutely outstanding player and he should have gotten that penalty.  I really thought he was going to score on that ball from Agger.  He desperately needs some support in the attack and I think once we have a striker (Gareth Bale's face finished with aplomb, I wonder if it'll be available in January) for him to combine with we're going to see him go up another level (terrifying to think about!).

Sterling had a hard match.  Vertonghen is a beast and really gave him a bit of a reality check I think.  Dowd was a total cunt about it in some instances though as Sterling really took the brunt of a few dodgy challenges and didn't get the call.  It was tough to watch the little guy get so frustrated, but props to him for trying hard the whole way and not seeing the red mist like he has a couple of times before.  And he did get the beating of Vertonghen a couple of times too.  He really is an outstanding talent for his age and he's still only getting better.  Each time I see him I get more excited for his future.

Why is everyone saying that Henderson was bad last night?  Dowd fucked him on the Dempsey dive that led to their FK goal, and he was reasonably solid otherwise.  He tackled hard, pressed intelligently, and moved the ball well.  He did miss a good chance to put one in the net, which was painful.

Allen is not on form, and he needs a rest.  He's been playing 2-3 games per week for us for months now and I'm sure its starting to wear on him a bit.  Lucas coming back is going to be a huge boon.  When a well-rested Allen comes back into the fold and gets to play in a more free role where both he and Rodgers say he's best, we're going to see a totally different animal.  He was amazing in the beginning of the season, and he will find form again.  

Gerrard is my footballing idol and favorite player to ever play the game.  I love him to death, but he's a bit frustrating to watch.  I don't like the way his role requires him to sit so deep, I think it really shackles him and removes his best qualities from his play.  He's better able to spark attacks and support the front men than anyone else in the team and he needs to be allowed to do that.  He loves those late runs into the area from deep, and if he was allowed to get into those sorts of positions he could only do good for us.  He can finish, he isn't afraid to try those incisive passes, and he combines well with Suarez.  Let's get him in a position to do so.

Downing is so bad.  I've tried to love him, and I had some hope when he looked reasonable as a LB.  But he really isn't good enough.  I can't believe he just stopped and let Lennon go like that, absolutely ridiculous.

Agger was great again, he's our best CB (IMO) and proving why we did well to hang on to him.

Skrtel was a little shaky, but overall not too bad.

Johnson tried to play, but couldn't really produce this time.  He looked a threat at times, but just completely switched off a few times.

Reina had a tough night.  Downing hung him out to dry and then that free kick was painful.  You could see on his face as it went in that it really hurt him mentally.  We all know he has the quality, and I can't help but have faith that he can and will find it again.

Shelvey looked good coming on.  He was positive and tried to drive us on, but he didn't get too much time to make an impact.

Assaidi isn't starting and we were confused about that, but I think now we have a better idea.  Someone of his pace and quality should really do better coming on against a tired defense.  He wasn't terrible, but he looked like he was lacking in any real motivation to go after the game.

I want to see more of Suso and Sahin.  In the case of the former, he's really looked good when he's gotten time.  He's a threat going forward and I think his ability can really change the dynamic of a game when we're behind.  I would have been absolutely thrilled to see him start over Downing (and Enrique play at LB) as I think he could have had a good battle going forward with Walker.  As for Sahin, he's absolute class and can pass teams to death.  BR seems really stubborn about giving Allen a rest at this point and I can understand it because we haven't had a direct replacement for the holding role fit (though I think Henderson can play in this position if he's given the chance) and I think that is getting in the way of Sahin having more time on the pitch.

Ultimately this is my very uneducated opinion and obviously BR and everyone who makes the decisions for the club knows more than we do, and I'll support them till the end.  As a fan though, its frustrating to see the same old issues over and over again because it makes it feel like we're not moving forward.  I think we're making progress every match but I want to see more wins.  I know we aren't going to win the premier league, but game after game I'm left really feeling like we deserved 3 points and failed to get them.",0,1354205545,null,0,false,0,c78m6zp,t3_13yexw,t1_c78m6zp,t3_13yexw,null,1430532364,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,jihangir,null,null,"IANAL, but my understanding of British common law and contracts suggests that the situation is a bit more complex.

By parking on their land, you are agreeing to these terms and conditions **provided they are displayed and clearly visible at the time of your parking**. Typically these terms and conditions are displayed on one or more noticeboards around the car park.

Just as British common law honors other non-written agreements (for example, if you walk into a restaurant and order a bunch of food, then refuse to pay and leave, you're liable) contracts entered into by the above means are **legally binding**.

There is a precedent of Private Parking Companies (the PPC called ""Private Eye"", for example) approaching the DVLA for breach of contract incidents, and the DVLA have, in the past, given the contact details out. Note that in spite of this, if the parking company were to approach the courts they could obtain a court order requiring the police/DVLA to reveal your identity. They then get onto debt collection agencies who persue the charge on their behalf.

Now, what I think you're getting at, is how these penalties are illegal.

A PPC can only (legally) claim for losses. Only the government can enforce penalties and or fines. This means that the maximum that these companies can legally fine you for, is the 'cost' of your parking there. That is, the cost of your parking ticket. So if you get a penalty notice for £65, write back and offer them the £3-4 your parking ticket should have cost, and a polite note saying their penalty charge is unenforceable under the law.

My main issue is with media reporting and the press' general anti-police attitude. As I've said already, not a fan of this because it goes against our established legal principles. The officers being interviewed under caution can be done already and they can be convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence, misconduct in a public office or various other offences if appropriate. Many of the officers they suggest would be interviewed under caution will be guilty of nothing, so it's not moral in my opinion to dole out additional powers when there are mechanisms in place already.

He also has a big interest in charity so he'll lend his approval to charities that may use his 9th Doctor portrayal for fundraising, etc (specifically, auctions for signed merch and what not.)

Seeing as how he chose his words so carefully in the past, i can't help but wonder if his latest response is just a way to be cheeky while drumming up attention for the show. Even if he's not in it, it seems that he regards the show rather well and would like to see them do well. 

Also, since RTD was once cited as the reason Eccleston left (rumors, etc,) it's possible that he's changed his tune since Moffat is in charge...

Even if you weren't fouled, the referee will be more inclined to give you the free kick/penalty if you appealed for it. Gary Neville actually did a really good analysis on this whole ""diving"" aspect of the game. There was a certain part where a Sunderland player (if I remember correctly) got fouled in the penalty area but didn't go down/raise his hands to show that he got fouled and hence didn't get a penalty.

But back on point here, it isn't just Suarez that does that hand raising thing, everyone does it. Even when Bale does ridiculous dives, he does it, and there's nothing wrong either. If it gives you more of a chance to get a penalty, why the heck not? Overall, Suarez still gets a lot of shit for what he does, much more than anyone else who does the same thing.

I actually agree that people should cover the cost of their education - that point was directed at the argument that only graduates should fund tuition.  Either it should be publicly funded because we consider it something everyone should be encouraged to do for the good of the country - like school - or it should be privately funded because it's an experience for individual benefit.  The graduate tax represents a strange half way house between those two positions.

If you go to university and it does not boost your career enough to cover the full costs of tuition and lost salaries, there was no economic benefit in your going to university and it was purely a luxury.

My pick in this case would be Huntelaar, only because Cavani would likely cost well beyond 30. 

But, if we want to keep the Uruguayan goal machine in the center spot, I think that we need a creative attacking midfielder (and desperately do anyway). Someone we can either put at the top of our midfield OR on the wing. Should we be able to afford and/or persuade him, the perfect fit here would be Reus (followed by a Götze or Hamsik).

I used to be with Be, and moved away because they couldn't do Fibre. But the only reason Be can do their ""unlimited"" thing at the moment (and the reason they are having such trouble with fibre) is that they currently only offer ADSL-speed packages. With the mindset of their users (unlimited is king, p2p-heavy, but not willing to pay over the odds), as soon as they offer and uncapped, unthrottled 80MBit fibre connection they're going to go bankrupt because unlike other ISPs, their users will *use* that bandwidth 24/7 and their bandwidth bill will be astronomical.

I haven't done much research recently, but last I heard the only ISP doing uncapped, unthrottled fibre is Sky, and I won't use them on principle. Besides, I hear contention is now taking its toll on Sky as more people jump on that bandwagon.

For me, I chose a fast, high-quality connection with a (250GB/month) cap over throttling or a slow unlimited connection because I then know I can then get that film I want to watch *immediately* at the time I want to watch it, at the cost of having to be a bit careful with how much data I use for always-on activities.

2. Totally agree, 100%.

3. Lloris is one of the best keepers in the world, I don't think he is over-eager, it's just the way goal keepers are, they are crazy people and I don't exactly know why but most people would agree, I like this style.. he shows not a lot of fear when going out for a ball but you must realise that all keepers are prone to making mistakes, and like yesterday he did make a mistake and got lucky, but considering that I don't know if it would be better for nearly a 1v1 right infront of the goal. Perhaps he done the right thing?

It's important to note that these ~~fines~~ invoices don't exist in a vacuum. There's lots of ways you can find yourself having to pay it that have little or nothing to do with the original fine. Off the top of my head, I can think of several examples:

 1. Your university won't let you graduate while you have ~~fines~~ money outstanding. They won't bother taking you to court over them - what student in their right mind is going to sacrifice their degree over £100 worth of parking fines, even if those fines aren't legally enforceable?
 1. You drive a company car; your employer has already paid the ~~fine~~ invoice and is now asking you to reimburse them. While you're technically within your rights to inform them that their poor management is not your problem, this can be a very good way to lose your job.
 1. You get such a ~~fine~~ invoice while driving a hire car. The hire company pays the ~~fine~~ invoice and takes the money directly from your credit card; the bank won't reverse the charge because as far as they're concerned, you agreed to pay any extra fees to the hire company. The bank's call centre staff don't know about this being unenforceable and nor do the hire company's staff.
 1. You work for an organisation which has its own car park; management of that car park is outsourced to such a company. That company issues parking permits with registration numbers on but they don't put a barrier in place; permits are just a piece of paper you're meant to put on your dashboard. You've never had such a permit but you use the car park every day. The management firm gets your details and reports them to HR, who treat is as a disciplinary offence.

This is distorted by the fact that older drivers are less likely to survive a crash, so I presume the fatalities of innocent road users are even higher for at-fault younger drivers.

If young drivers are considered safe enough to be allowed on the road, surely this category is too?

There are factors which need to be considered: If older people drive shorter journeys through populated areas (which they do) where the risk of an accident is higher per mile, should they be penalise them for having a higher accident rate per mile?

I was hoping to find a plot of fatalities for *other* road users (including pedestrians), plotted against age of the at-fault driver, but I cannot find one.

Stats from 2011 (the rule changes in October due to the POF act make no difference to the enforceability of private parking tickets)

* 1.8million private parking invoices issued (approx 40% are ignored)
* 845 small claims issued
* 49 cases came before a judge
* 24 cases won by parking companies
* 25 won by defendants 

* 36,000-1 chance of going to court
* 72,000-1 chance of losing in court

Note the difference between the amount of claims issued by parking companies, and the amount that came before a judge. If you submit any kind of defence, the parking company will almost certainly drop the case. They know full well they will lose in court and each time they do, it chips away at their business model and makes it ever more public that their ""tickets"" are completely speculative.

Of those 24 cases ""won"" by parking companies, I've never seen any evidence that the defendant actually turned up to court and offered a reasonable defence beyond ""prove I was driving"". Most will be default judgments.

In short, don't park like a dickhead, but if you do get preyed on by a private parking company, ignore the ticket and following dozen or so letters threatening debt collectors and keep your money.

Nowadays there is the POPLA appeals process, but it costs the parking company £27 every time someone appeals, so they are increasingly just dropping the ticket as soon as someone submits a halfway decent appeal to them, to save them the money.

true,jimofwales,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"I've been heavily involved in the development of the Green Deal. My advice would be to wait until the full consumer scheme launches in the new year. 

The interest rate will be 7.5%, but will likely start at 5.5% for the first few years, then rise by 2% each year. This is because otherwise you would be subsidising people who took over your loan in the future (energy prices will rise, and inflation will eat away at the loan).

That telegraph article is ridiculous, the Green Deal is likely to run for the next 10-15 years and it hasn't really launched yet. BG have gone early offering assessments, but the work won't get done until next year.

The Green Deal is essentially a 'pay as you save' finance scheme. People have been slating it, but all evidence shows that PAYS schemes work well and can help pay for energy efficiency improvements that would be out of most people's reach. I will certainly be taking it up to pay for external wall insulation and floor insulation for my house. 

The reason to wait is that ECO (the energy company obligation) is likely to subsidise a lot of the measures. This is to bring the capital cost under what's called the 'golden rule'. This means that the monthly payments on the finance must be lower than your energy bill savings, so the consumer will be beter off each month. It's still incertain how much will be available and who will be eligible. There will also be a 'cash back' scheme to incentivise early adopters, it won't be large for a boiler replacement, probably around £100, but it's better than nothing.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;why should you pay £9k to study a subject that has an overall positive and net benefit on the UK (in tax alone).

As I see it, one important difference between the current system and one where every taxpayer funds university is that, currently, the people who are the least capable of contributing don't have to.  Struggling single parents, the elderly, and low earners in general would have to face extra tax burdens (or there would be less spending elsewhere) if university were funded out of general taxation, despite the fact that the main financial benefit of university education accrues to the student.  And that's ignoring all the non-financial benefits that *only* the student benefits from, such as personal enrichment, life experience, new friends and so on.

I fully support reducing the risk of attending university, so I think that it's absolutely right for the safety net to be funded collectively.  I would even argue for increasing the minimum earnings threshold to at least the national average (currently around £25k I believe).  But when graduates are financially better off even with the extra loan payments, I don't see how the only reasonable system is one where we expect other people to pay for their education.

As I say, I can understand how people would *prefer* a different system, but the idea that the current system is *unreasonable* just seems completely absurd to me.  I truly cannot understand how anybody who examined the system impartially can come to that conclusion.

&gt;i would rather pay higher tax to give young people a fair chance than screw them up because a generation decided ""they should have it all"")

The idea of crippling student debt is quite simply a myth.  The debt doesn't screw people up.  At all.

Something like 50% of 18yr olds in the UK go to university. Firstly, that means that there are 50% who don't go. That doesn't necessarily mean that they made a bad decision or that they've failed at life. Secondly, do we even NEED 50% of people in the country with a degree? Are there that many graduate-level jobs around in a country like the UK? Clearly, some degrees aren't worth doing and clearly some universities and courses are more worthwhile - and that's the decision prospective students need to make. Is law at cambridge worth £9k/yr? Definitely. Is sociology at Lincoln? Perhaps not.

Also, the US uses quite a different system. University fees go up, but they also have loans which often need to be repaid before you even graduate, and there's often no amount of income required before paying them back, not to mention high interest rates. Our system is far nicer than that!

I suppose this comes down to whether you believe university education is a right or a commodity. Personally I think that when you reach 18 it's a luxury to choose to go into further education. You're a grown adult and you can pay for the degree if it benefits you. If it doesn't benefit you, you don't even pay it back.

Or taking 1 illustrative example. a potential Teacher who goes to university leaves with $50k debt, and has to someone find the buying power to afford a place to live in an area for teaching, which they are incapable of doing (given their career), but we need teachers and we need teachers (who live within the areas they serve), same for other professions (Nurses etc).

What realistically happens is that those that graduate with high debt will have a high expectation of return for their investment and we will end up paying more for the service, so in the teacher example, we have to rapidly increase the salaries via taxation, and we end up with the bill anyway.

Understand that rejection is an unfortunate product of the type of society and economic model our country subscribes to. Do not take it personally. 

Take each rejection and BECOME BETTER from it:

 - Seek feedback as to the reason for the rejection
 - If you are being rejected at CV screening stage, seek to improve your CV. You can do this through friends, colleagues, acquaintances looking at your CV and suggesting improvements/changes. Quite a few chargeable CV writing services will take a look at your CV for free and provide comments before they offer a paid service. (Accept the comments/suggestions and decline the paid for service). Google search for CVs in your field of expertise. See what other people put on their CV. Make yours better.
 - If you are printing your CV, use at LEAST 120gsm paper. Don't use shitty 80gsm laser paper. Don't use coloured paper.

Do NOT let rejection get you down! Keep applying.

Customise your application, cover letter and CV for each job you apply for. I can't stress how important this is. I am currently recruiting a role and it is painfully obvious which applicants are taking the time to align their CV to the role, and which applicants are firing 100 of the same CV to each vacancy that strikes their fancy. When looking at a pile of 50 CVs and 2 vacancies are available, I'm sure you can work out which CVs hit the shredder.

If the job advert is looking for a scientist with experience with a particular technique, refer to it in your application. EG:
During my previous role with ScienceCore LLC, assignments included &lt;insert technique the job advert is looking for&gt;. I led a small team of 3 and exceeded the requirements of the task by developing and improving existing procedures. My recommendations and suggestions resulted in notable efficiency improvements and overall cost reductions. 

Take time to research and understand CV marketing techniques. Plenty of advice and samples on the internet. Realise that your CV is a sales advertisement for you and is the first thing that an employer will see about you. The number of CVs I see with spelling mistakes, or appalling layout makes me grimace... Take time to make your CV look professional. Do not include the words Curriculum Vitae or the letters C.V. at the top of your document.

Do NOT let rejection get you down! Keep applying.

To answer your question, a software architect/engineer, and full time cyclist. I see the daily failure that is mass private transportation (ie the car), and it just makes no sense. Driving a car is such a complex task, yet one that could be 100% automated, or at least you could have a better ratio of driver to passenger (which can be as low as 1 to 0). That is an awful lot of time wasted stomping on pedals.

Nearly everyday I have to make an evasive action due to bad driving, which can often be deliberate.

That is to say that those things are not mutually exclusive and could all have been going on.

Also, teaching children about the limits our laws impose on us is not the same thing as teaching them road safety.  Although, it is possible that they were also being taught something that more unequivocally passes for road safety (this isn't clear in the article, though).

I think the concern, for me at least, is that impressionable young children are being introduced to something that has a rather sinister side, but it is being portrayed as entirely normal.  I don't have a problem with kids playing with speed guns.  I have a problem with them being encouraged to accept the police, the law and reporting people to the police for breaking the law as if it were the morally correct thing to do.  It isn't, necessarily, and the difference between ethics and law isn't made clear to kids.  Law enforcement can be a threat to society, as well as a benefit, and this is also not made clear.

this works on 2 levels - you find out about stuff before it gets advertised, and they get someone they think they can trust because you've come from someone they know.

I say this as I used to work in the IT dept for an emergency service. The type of request's I would see were-

How many Apple iPhone devices do you issue

How many Apple iPad devices do you issue

How many Apple products do you intend in the next 12 months

How many laptops/phones have been reported lost in the last 12 
months

You can just see the headline ""XXXXX spends X thousand pounds per year on flashy fondleslabs"" (we didn't have any apple products btw, failed all the security standards).

For example, the £30m thread's top 2 comments are about Falcoa and us having a budget of £60m after selling some players. Realistically we will add someone like Ince for cheap, adding squad depth, and someone along the lines of Borini, who's semi-cheap and can play as either a center forward or a winger, making runs into the channel(maybe Adrian of Atletico, although he might be a little unrealistic as well).

true,stupendousdragon,tardis,TARDIS,"""we must not look at goblin men we must not buy their fruits: who knows upon the soil they fed their hungry thirsty roots?"" 

Since the 1970s, critics have tended to view ""Goblin Market"" as an expression of Rossetti's feminist (or proto-feminist) and homosexual politics. Some critics suggest the poem is about feminine sexuality and its relation to Victorian social mores. In addition to its clear allusions to Adam and Eve, forbidden fruit, and temptation, there is much in the poem that seems overtly sexual, such as when Lizzie, going to buy fruit from the goblins, considers her dead friend Jeanie, ""Who should have been a bride; / But who for joys brides hope to have / Fell sick and died"", and lines like, ""She sucked their fruit globes fair or red""; and ""Lizzie uttered not a word;/ Would not open lip from lip/ Lest they should cram a mouthful in;/ But laughed in heart to feel the drip/ Of juice that syruped all her face,/ And lodged in dimples of her chin,/ And streaked her neck which quaked like curd.""

The poem's attitude toward this temptation seems ambiguous, since the happy ending offers the possibility of redemption for Laura, while typical Victorian portrayals of the ""fallen woman"" ended in the fallen woman's death. It is worth noting that although the historical record is lacking, Rossetti apparently began working at Highgate Penitentiary for fallen women shortly after composing ""Goblin Market"" in the spring of 1859.

According to Antony Harrison of North Carolina State University, Jerome McGann reads the poem as a criticism of Victorian marriage markets and conveys ""the need for an alternative social order"". For Sandra Gilbert, the fruit represents Victorian women's exclusion from the world of art. Other scholars – most notably Herbert Tucker – view the poem as a critique on the rise of advertising in pre-capitalist England, with the goblins utilising clever marketing tactics to seduce. Laura J. Hartman, among others, has pointed out the parallels between Laura's experience and the experience of drug addiction. Another interpretation has observed an image of Jesus Christ in Lizzie when she says: ""Eat me, drink me, love me."" This is imagery used to identify Christ's sacrifice in communion services.

The poem uses an irregular rhyme scheme, often using couplets or ABAB rhymes, but also repeating some rhymes many times in succession, or allowing long gaps between a word and its partner. The metre is also irregular, typically (though not always) keeping four or five stresses, in varying feet, per line. The lines below show the varied stress patterns, as well as an interior rhyme (grey/decay) picked up by the end-rhyme with ""away"". The initial line quoted here, ""bright"", rhymes with ""night"" a full seven lines earlier.

Enrique on the wing however is working brilliantly. His linkup with Suarez is amazing. Would love seeing Robinson in this role too. There's a reason they call him the next Bale...

Kelly as CB would be pretty cool, seeing as that's where he started.

Anecdotally, from Spain (wonderful), France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg (although that hardly counts because it can be traversed in very little time), the true obnoxiousness of British roads (and the people) was revealed. Paris was a bit crap, but even then La Sienne provided an excellent means to pass through the city. In one five mile journey through east Manchester I get more hassle than the entire road trip. It also reveals a core tenant of Britishness, an entitlement to superiority and to the abuse of others for X, Y or Z—in my case because I have two wheels and travel slightly under the speed limit.

I think there is a correlation.

I keep seeing gifs of the Master, but the only time I remember seeing him, he was an old professor/scientist guy with an insectile alien assistant (Chan To? Kept adding it her sentences) who was repressed as a human with a fob watch like the Doctor had. He opened it, regenerated, stole the TARDIS, flew to Earth, turned it into a paradox machine, then took over. Then Martha became a war hero who travelled across the Earth (whole episode here) and the Doctor was aged to show all 900 of his years, but they fixed him, etc. etc., and the Master died. Was really depressing because now it seemed like the Doctor was really the only Time Lord left. I don't remember anything about host bodies, and I saw a gif where the Doctor was strapped down and said something along the lines of, ""For someone who knows everything, you sure are an idiot."" (What?) ""That guard is exactly one inch too short."" (Gun to the face.) But I don't remember watching that.

Sorry if any of that is innacurate, took a road to the skull, received some brain damage, memory is shoddy. Anyway I was pretty sure I've seen every episode but I might have missed a Christmas Special??? What other episodes is the Master in?

All GS is good for is farming UCAS points. Only mediocre unis use UCAS points as a measure of skill. UCAS points say that a B in chemistry is worse than an A in photography.

Absolutely what matters is proven interest in your subject outside of A levels, and a rock solid understanding of the fundamentals (especially core 1-4 maths if you are doing a sciencey subject).

TO BE HONEST THOUGH: Theres little reason to *not* do GS. Cambridge wont look down on you for doing bad at it (maybe email them about this though). I did no revision for mine and got a B. Which sucked as I was AAAA perfect before. But I dont even have it on my CV now that Im in the real world.

Why the hell am I still posting here haha.

Oh and 7 a levels is insane. Consider lowering it to 4 and doing those four really well. Cambridge website mentions that they prefer this. Give the admissions office of a college you like (any one it doesnt matter) an email - they are great for giving advice.

true,erowidtrance,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;You don't expand the military for them to sit around playing solitarie. Notice everything has to be cut, but the military.

Many countries have militaries that only serve a defensive force, Switzerland has mandatory military service and every household has a gun yet they are one of the most anti-militaristic countries on earth. The military would effectively be cut which you keep conveniently ignoring, no foreign entanglements would overall cut costs. 

&gt;This is worthless as an argument. Chernobyl is already fucked, lets use it to dump more waste. A truly progressive statement would be land redistribution.

Of course that would be a more progressive step but whats going to provide that baring a revolution? It seems you can only see in black and white terms, if everything you want isn't entirely fulfilled any progress in the right direction is scoffed at. In politics things usually change gradually, you have to take what you can get. 

&gt;Yes, lets stop state funding for the military by turning the country into a military dictatorship.

You talked about UKIP promoting fear but nothing is more inflammatory and fear mongering than this statement. To say that ending foreign conflicts and putting some of the saved money back into the military would create a dictatorship is fucking insane. I'm not even advocating it but military numbers have been higher in the past, were we ruled by a military dictatorship then?

&gt;If you haven't been paying attention, there has been a Goldman-Sacks coup of europe, including greece, italy and soon the Bank of England.

I agree but there is a clear distinction between the EU policy that benefits the big banks and which the the major parties agree with and UKIP advocating Greece go it alone which in the long run would more likely benefit the general public there.

UKIP in this regard is clearly proposing the exact opposite  remedy to the vested moneyed interests who're successfully pillaging countries like Greece.

When I started watching it, I was just coming out of feeling a bit depressed (was not diagnosed depressed, but we all get those really down periods that can happen for awhile.) I was feeling kind of low for a couple of months, but things started looking up. And then my friend introduced me to this show. 

I knew that this was an amazing show when 9 said ""And everybody lives, Rose! Just this once! Everybody lives!"" That line was so happy, and it made me cry from being so happy. The episodes were incredibly intriguing, and made me feel a wide range of emotions.

Overall, I think the show isn't about the Doctor, or his companions, but it's about hope, and being the absolute best person you can be, no matter what. And that is incredibly happy. Since I started watching it about a year ago my life has been incredible. This whole year has been the best year of my life, and not for any particular reason. I haven't fallen in love again, my grades (Junior in high school) aren't particularly great, and I still have yet to find a job.

On a more general note though...

...telco infrastructure is a funny thing. I still believe the Government should be subsidizing, or at least financing, big internet infrastructure spending. At the moment, especially in the mobile web, there's a real bandwidth bottleneck. Markets alone are not providing the necessary incentives that the capital-intensive telecommunications industry needs to expand mobile and fixed-line infrastructure at a rate optimal to the UK economy.

Ensuring the UK provides world-class internet infrastructure to its businesses and consumers encourages innovation, drives efficiency and fosters the types of skills and services that increase our global competitiveness. To [quote McKinsey](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/technology_and_innovation/internet_matters): 

&gt;**Public decision makers should act as catalysts to unleash the Internet’s
growth potential.** Governments could leverage Internet public spending as a
catalyst for innovation. Indeed, countries with the highest public investment in the
Internet are also those with the largest nonpublic Internet contribution to GDP.
Governments’ own use of the Internet encourages citizens to use it. Government
e-transformation creates large-scale, complex demand that stimulates the supply
ecosystem. In addition, governments must promote Internet usage by informing
and training businesses and individuals.

The UK has done a good job already but this is game is not over. The internet will continue to transform the way we live, much like it has over the last decade, albeit at an even faster pace. It would be an expensive mistake not to wholeheartedly embrace this disruptive force now.

Direct government subsidies are not the only way to boost infrastructure investment. Personally, I think we may well see a significant relaxation of net neutrality rules at some point within the next 24 months. This will effectively transfer capital from the cash-rich internet giants (Google, Facebook, Amazon) to the squeezed telcos and will encourage further infrastructure spending. 

Either way, we need good internet infrastructure and someone is gonna have to pay for it. Funnily enough, I most certainly wouldn't mind parting with some more of my cash in exchange for faster internet.

**TL:DR** I want faster internet.",0,1354234622,null,0,false,0,c78v3ff,t3_13zn1n,t1_c78v3ff,t1_c78nsps,null,1430536747,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,jihangir,null,null,"&gt;I have a pretty dire outlook on the future of the UK both as a nation unto itself, and as a global player. i question it's ability to cope with the coming challenges (massive debt, lack of comparable modern infrastructure, little primary/secondary industry, massive income inequality, social problems, NHS that isn't coping). can anybody identify suitable reasons to be hopeful? or is it time to jump ship?

**Disclaimer**: I'm an advocate of the Austrian school of economics. While widely detracted by most Keynesians, Austrians were the only school to accurately predict the 2007 financial crisis, so make of that what you will. ;)

I think our biggest immediate threat comes from the Eurozone crisis.

We may not have adopted the single currency, but much of our financial services sector (contributing a whopping 79% of our GDP) depend on European commerce.

When the possibility of the Greeks ditching the Euro became a possibility (and was publicised) the value of the FTSE dropped by 16%, wiping £190bn off the value of the UK's private sector. It's easy to chuck around words like ""billions"", but for comparison, that's more than **twice the annual cost of the entire NHS** to the Taxpayer...!

A Greek exit from the Eurozone would quite probably be a death-blow for the Euro. If the Euro collapses, it would cause financial turmoil for the UK, and would drastically increase lending rates, for a while. This would lead to a period of declined growth, further increases in unemployment and potentially cause [capital flight](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/CapitalFlight.html).

For some good reading on the Euro, and how it will affect us, I suggest Phillip Bagus's [The Tragedy of the Euro](http://mises.org/books/bagus_tragedy_of_euro.pdf)

Anecdotal evidence, I know, but earlier this week my boss was informed that we are to quote our clients in USD or GBP wherever possible, and to avoid quoting in Euros because it's a ""high risk currency"". I found that pretty shocking, but I digress.

While the exit of Greece and collapse of the Euro would 'fuck things up a bit' the British economy would recover after a few months/years (I wouldn't like to say how long, and to what extent)

The real long term problem with the British economy is the unwieldy national debt we're accumulating. 6% of our public spending goes on paying off the **interest** on our debt. You read that right, the **interest** on our debt costs us 6% of annual public spending. Given that our income from tax revenues is marginal compared to our debt, unless drastic steps are taken to reduce that debt (i.e. Austerity, which is widely unpopular with voters, but unfortunately essential for long term viability) a British default in the next few decades is inevitable. Raising taxes really would be detrimental at this point - If you're a Guardian reader you'll be familiar with all the stories of tax avoidance. 

Tax increases would only exacerbation this problem. If the Government caves into public pressure to increase tax legislation to curb tax avoidance, then it's likely that investors in British businesses would take their capital elsewhere, to more economically liberal countries. There is actually a theoretical optimal tax rate that provides the maximum revenue (hint: It's not 100%) and I imagine we have exceeded this already.

As always, don't take financial advice from some weirdo on the internet, but I'm personally not worried for now. If the Euro crashes, I'll start worrying a bit, and watch the inflation rate closely. But I imagine we'd have to follow our current trajectory for another 20-30 years before we're past the point of no return.

**tl;dr: We're Doomed I say. Doomed! ^Just ^kidding.**

But I would say, as these are your predicted grades, remember that you can do better than you are predicted. I guess you have to decide how likely you think that is, or how likely you think it is you may get a lower offer than usual. 6 AS levels seems a lot though, so perhaps cutting down to 3rd for A levels as most people do will allow you the extra time to up the grades.

Do you think the expenditure on foreign war accounts for less than 1% of military spending? The conflict in Libya alone last year which UKIP apposed [according to some estimations cost](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/sep/26/uk-operations-libya-costs) between 2-4% of the 40 billion military budget.

&gt;However, the military is an unelected constant that dictates to parliament and there's plenty to say but I'll be brief: military schools, fast tracking soldiers into teaching, a near ubiquitous media control, the militarisation and total surveillance of the internet. Oh, and secret courts. The UKIP party speaks to colonial powers, that is clear.

There is a distinction between the current government treating the average working soldiers like shit, plans to transfer their jobs to expensive contractors &amp; increasing foreign interventionism and UKIP who plan to pay the soldiers/familes better &amp; spend less on foreign wars. One is clearly far more in line with the desires of the military industrial complex war machine than the other.

By the time you will be applying, you will have finished your first year of sixth form and have your actual AS exam results, and those are the ones that count. 

As for those results, the actual AS level results, it's a pretty good idea to make sure you have an A in Maths, as otherwise there's a good chance you might not even get an interview. Getting less than A's in subjects which aren't the focal point of the degree are somewhat irrelevant. A D in a photography A-level when you're wanting to do maths says nothing about your ability at maths (likewise, neither does an A*), and the admissions officers know that.

My own personal advice, which you can choose to ignore if you want as it may or may not be good for you as an individual, is that it's really not worth stressing over in your first year. Take your time and enjoy learning your A-level maths. If you're keen, direct that towards having fun with maths puzzles like you can find [here](http://nrich.maths.org/secondary-upper) or perhaps reading about some interesting maths related problems/results/jokes/history [in this book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Professor-Stewarts-Hoard-Mathematical-Treasures/dp/1846683467).

The ""entitlement"" you mention is rather strange really, particularly the ingrained notion ""Cars pay road tax and so have more rights to the road than bikes"". Of course it's bullshit anyway - road tax doesn't exist in that form - but it's odd that people don't extend the 'rule' to horses, or carts, or ambulances or police cars. Or even low emission cars.

The same retrograde that visited hookers in Asia who were doing it for the fun of it, or the 1950s view of Yorkshire women having tea on the table in a timely fashion? You are describing a party that has no coherent message and out of data primary material. Talk is cheap and UKIP can't even afford that.

You must concede that that is a giant if. **IF** there are no foreign engagements there doesn't need to be an increase, maybe. However, seen as all public services are heavily slashed the military has de facto special treatment.

No coherent drug policy [1], no meaningful coherent financial reform or credibility [2], incoherent military intentions, no coherent anything, but a repetition of everything anti-eu. Nothing said on UK internet censorship, fitting that because the party is a condensation of Conservative thought into an even older men's club pining for the good old days of Britishness—that's not even hyperbole. They are a party that almost exclusively trades on fighting tyranny abroad while doing things like entrenching the military and the monarchy. It's a joke to even call them a viable 4th option, let alone an alternative or libertarian.

However, it is clear that civilisation continues to be subverted, and one of the major objectives of the subversives is the ubiquitous use of stupefying chemicals.

asked by BBC BBC Home Affairs Correspondent matt prodger http://twitter.com/MattProdger newsnight reporter, ""if he's certain?"" the replay was ""would not have tweeted if not certain""
No one is accusing him of anything - apart from you it would seem.
The facts are that the BBC report http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20544939 is about Rolf Harris.
He may be a material witness and not an abuser - I certainly hope so.

The title: ""Rolf Harris Interviewed Under Caution Over Sex Offences"" is an accusation.

The reason I ask for ""first hand"" evidence is that you cannot defend yourself from libel by saying someone else said it first. Otherwise I'm sure 10,000 people on Twitter wouldn't have letters being written to them right now, some just for retweeting.

The second reason I ask for ""first hand"" proof is that if you did indeed have knowledge of this, the fact that, for legal reasons, nothing aside from speculation as to who this person is is being written about would suggest some sort of block on reporting who it is. e.g. Injunction.",0,1354244908,null,0,false,0,c78xu8h,t3_140pk5,t1_c78xu8h,t1_c78wn8g,null,1430538040,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,crackodactyl,tardis,TARDIS,"Oooh a great premise for an episode. A Dalek who somehow crashed to Earth long ago and was severley damaged in the process. When it awakens it starts up an emergency program where it attempts to get any kind of communication with other Daleks, but because of the damage of the crash it picks up and tries to interpret the first signal it gets as the thing it is suppose to do. It picks up the broadcasting from a nearby t.v provider airing the original How the Grinch stole Christmas. 

It interprets the movie as instructions for what to do, however with a bit more deadly intentions. The Doctor who was on his way to the first recorded Christmas celebration in Rome. Sadly for the Doctors plans the TARDIS is drawn to a much more important event on Christmas, upon arrival he is slightly disappointed and is not at all dressed for the time period of our modern time. He momentarily decided to hop back into the TARDIS but is drawn by all the people putting up fliers of missing/stolen things. Upon further investigation he learns that Christmas gifts and decorations are being stolen everywhere. With Christmas only days away help is needed fast. 

Well I have a whole idea for a show up in my head, I wrote a portion of it down and I hope you enjoy the brief little bit of it.

I visited London and Paris in the same trip last year. Here's what I can think of off the top of my head... 

**London**

* British Museum: It's free, but donate a bit of money if you can... They have the Rosetta Stone there

* Take advantage of the cycles for hire throughout the city. Bike through Hyde Park, it's only £1

* Very tourist-y I know, but take a spin on the London Eye. You'll get a beautiful view of the city and Parliament

* Tourist-y again, but the original Hard Rock Cafe is there

* If you're not a vegetarian, have an English breakfast and afternoon tea

* Take in a show, if the budget allows! We Will Rock You is still playing, I think


**PARIS**

* Get some gelato, STAT.

* If you're able-bodied, walk from the Louvre to the Arc de Triomphe. It's 2 miles, but the trip will take you down the Champs Elysees. Fantastic

* Go to see the Eiffel Tower as the sun is setting. Go see [THIS](http://youtu.be/zRvULOijKD4) with your own eyes. Enjoy watching boats float up and down the Seine while you wait

* **REMEMBER** if you're going to go to the Louvre, it is closed on Tuesdays. Plan accordingly

* If you're of age and you like wine, enjoy a glass on a patio and people watch

* If you know some French, try it out! I used to be conversational, but after years of not using it... it's terrible! The French people I tried to talk to appreciated my effort though (with a few innocent chuckles)

I hope this is helpful. I love to travel, but it is the small experiences during the trip that make it worth while. The Eiffel Tower at sunset, waiting for it to light up while watching the Seine...? To me, that's what life is pretty much about.. the small, meaningful things.

I do hope you have fun. You'll love it.

Let's not forget that that particular transfer window was a bit unique. The summer prior, we had hardly had any good signings, and the notable ones we did acquire (Cole, Jovanovic) did next to nothing for us. With new owners, we had to prove to Reina and Torres that we were legit. Signing Suarez must have convinced Reina, but it didn't convince Torres. So while we made a lot of money back on him, we had to spend an inflated amount to replace him, because it was so late and one does not simply replace Fernando Torres. 

With that said, no doubt we spent too much on Carroll. But at the time he was arguably England's hottest prospect, at least in terms of strikers. and those never come cheap.

Plus Carroll wanted to come here. He was at Newcastle, thinking we were the big league. Aguero, Tevez, and Balotelli have all played at the highest level and were being courted by the most serious contenders.

Also, I'm pretty sure we all know Allen isn't doing very well right now as well, yet Rodgers continues to praise him and all that, because he was the one that put 15 million up for him.

Honestly, no manager is going to drop condescending remarks on their own players to the media, that's just ridiculous. Especially Gerrard, who has been an important part of LFC history and the team captain. Morale will certainly drop if Rodgers started saying things like, ""I think Gerrard hasn't been performing up to standard, and my system is that if you're not performing, you'll be sitting on the bench, no matter how good of a player you were before."" and other comments like that.

A final mention for Kanpai (Sushiya's sister restaurant) on grindlay street by the lyceum theatre n the gardeners cottage (communal table , daily set menu) on london road and you have an idea of what is exciting me in the edinburgh food scene at the moment.

You raise some valid points that raise the believability, but I still find that episode less scary than previous ones; there are multiple scenes (easy example, the one where an angel grabs River's wrist) where nobody is looking at an angel, and it still stays still.

Rose Tyler: ...I scatter them, in time and space.

Rose Tyler: I want you safe, my Doctor. Protected from the false God. 
Emperor Dalek: You cannot hurt me. I am immortal. 
Rose Tyler: You are tiny. I can see the whole of time and space, every single atom of your existence, and I divide them.

Rose Tyler: Everything must come to dust. All things, everything dies. 

Rose Tyler: The time war ends. 
Emperor Dalek: I will not die! I cannot diieee!

Rose Tyler: How can I let go of this? I bring life.

true,Silent_Ranger,null,null,"I would love to sign a player capable of playing out wide, but who also makes incisive runs into vacated space in the box and is clinical - actually I want Borini back and healthy because I think he would be the perfect foil for Suarez.

1) As a bargain pick-up maybe Bojan from Milan, in y mind he would be the best signing because he was excellent for Barcelona in 2011 in limited action making darting runs into the spaces opened up behind and beside the defense with the pace to break through the back line - can play in the middle or out wide in a 4-3-3 and is very good at making runs that open up space for other teammates by forcing defeders to commit to him even if the play isn't to him

2) Possibly Pedro from Barca - he has been out of form for some time (and I believe that BR could bring him back) and could possibly be leaving for cheap with the immanent arrival of Neymar

3) As a reach signing I'd love to see Higuain - this is due to the fact that every year Madrid try to sell him and when he does go it might be for Van der Vaart money (€9 mil)

4) Antoine Griezmann just to throw out a name - he is a promising young winger similar to Sterling in many ways from Real Sociedad

5) Mario Gomez - likely out of our price range but he allegedly was coming to Liverpool in 2010 until he found out Hodgson was getting sacked - go figure...

6) Andre Schurrle - I adore him and at 22ish is still very young and is capable of scoring goals

7) Vedad Ibesevic - not really a ""Rogers-type player"" but the big man has a real nose for goals as a second rate striker - not a long term solution but a potent attacking option with real short term potential (think Cisse/Ba for Newcastle)

8) Cavani - a token reference but I don't know what to make of he rumors at this point

9) Seydou Doumbia - loved this guy in FIFA12, in real life scored 5 in CL last year and 20 in Russia; is fast, strong, a good (not great) finisher and seems to be versatile but I've never actually seen him play so....

10) Jovetic but only for the right price

11) Huntelaar would be an interesting one as he played with Suarez at Ajax - but that's not new

12) Ruben Castro - I've not seen him play but he has been on of the top scorers in La Liga over he past 2 years (14 and 6 so far which is comparable to Michu) for a sub-par Betis side

I'll end by reiterating my love for Bojan - I loved him as a young player and am frustrated that he rotted away on the bench at Barcelona and I think that under Rodgers he could really flourish and become the next great Liverpool #9. Obviously he would have an adjustment period but with Reina, Enrique, and Suso it would be a lot easier than it might otherwise be.

Why you say? Cause he's damn consistent, taking care and time honing his skill, he's youngish(23 goin on 24), and he's a solid finisher.

Call me crazy but as long as Sporting doesn't do some bullshit clause absurdity, I'd say he'd be a solid addition at the rate he is going. 


Quite honestly I don't want Walcott/the idea makes me uneasy, because I feel like Wenger will wanna twist our arm for Sterling. Hell, you'd be daft to think no club is looking at Sterling. I know he's a kid, but it's hard to determine if sterling is in it for the long run. I'd hate for him to leave us in defiance. I don't think he's an idiot like Rodwell. Also you'd be mad to say you'd be ok with getting Walcott and seeing Sterling leave.

Set work was excellent, I'm still trying to work out if they actually got permission to film some of the scenes inside No.10/HoC or not, as if they were replica sets then they were very good matches (particularly the No.10 interior one).

In America, they would just copy the story and attempt to adapt it for the audience.  Read: Ruin it.  They don't see the process involved, and by trying to copy it they would drain the story of its character.

I don't think they just sit down, write stories, and hire actors to act them out.  They cycle talent, and choose powers that fit the character the talent can best play.  Then they write stories around the characters and powers.

The only way this can be duplicated properly would be to not duplicate it at all.  Get some talent together, let them invent characters, build powers around that, and then go from there.  Don't make it soft TV-14 prime time bullshit.  Make it unapologetically real, a reflection of gritty culture, completely *not* glamorous.

Even then, the director has to be a real people person, not at all aloof.  American directors, nine times out of ten, are mostly ego with a little bit of flesh attached to it.  American talent would be doing a job and would want to impress, rather than honestly get to know the director to craft the best character possible for them to play.  I'm sure American television *nor* film have the cultural atmosphere that would make this work.

I just can't see American producers doing that.  They want to follow a script, build from a formula.  They'll ruin it, it will fail, and then companies like Hulu won't want to carry the real thing.  They'll think America doesn't like it when in fact what they would do to it here wouldn't work.  Then every fan over here wouldn't see the show unless we pirated it.

true,34Mbit,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"&gt;So - I ask again, why do so many motorists feel that their driving license includes a license to use any plot of land as a car park without checking if it is in fact a public car park, and not private property.

How often do you come across people parking in things that aren't designated as car parks? Do you regularly see people parking on playing fields, gardens, central reservations, beaches, etc.? I don't.

If you're calling council car parks 'public' and private car parks as 'private' then you're mistaken. A public place is somewhere the public is entitled to access, use, etc. A supermarket is a public place, regardless of who owns the parcel of land it sits on. A supermarket can't legitimately 'fine' you £100 for misplacing tins on shelves, and any such attempts will be met by the general public with general disobedience. The same goes for private parking firms; if the charges are excessive, they will become disobedient because they feel it is injust. It is injust because there is no expectation in the public consciousness that owning property makes you sovereign of the land and able to enforce stupid rules.",0,1354267659,null,0,false,0,c79227e,t3_13zvjk,t1_c79227e,t1_c791z8y,null,1430540305,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Only joking. We are in decline right not because of previous regimes frivolous spending on average players, lumbering our current squad with overpaid, confidence shot players such as Downing, Henderson &amp; Carroll. That meant that when we got in a new manager he had little to spend and is now trying to get the best out of a pretty poor squad. We had a ridiculously high wage bill with players such as Cole reportedly on £100k a week, meaning any new signings are going to demand similar money, considering their contribution will be much greater. 

Personally, I dont have too many complaints against the club. I can see what Rodgers is trying to instil into the players, even if his stubbornness and refusal to drop *his* players (such as Joe Allen) can get frustrating. We have an excellent crop of young players coming through, and most fans recognise that Rodgers plan is a long term one, not a short fix.

BTW, for those interested I wrote to my MP (Caroline Lucas) about the Matthew Wood and Azhar Ahmed. This is the reply I got. 

&gt;""Thank you for your email and I apologise for the delay in responding. I have been receiving exceptionally high volumes of correspondence over recent months, which has resulted in a backlog.
 
&gt;I heard about the cases of Matthew Woods and Azhar Ahmed and agree that prison sentences in such cases do not serve any helpful purpose, and that serious questions result from the criminalisation of people who make such comments, even if they are highly offensive.
 
&gt;The case of Azhar Ahmed was raised in the House of Lords, and the Government response was as follows:
 
&gt;“We have a long tradition of free speech in the United Kingdom. However, we have to balance the right to freedom of speech with the need to prevent actions which intimidate, threaten violence or incite others to hatred. Current legislation, including that on offences of incitement to racial or religious hatred, and on racially and religiously aggravated offences, aims to strike that delicate balance.
 
&gt;The Government do not intervene in operational police matters, but forces have a duty to investigate all crimes and, following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, to decide whether or not an incident reaches the threshold required for prosecution under the relevant legislation.”
 
&gt;Since becoming an MP I have spoken out vociferously against the erosion of freedom of expression, and I work closely with the organisation Liberty on such matters, for example on the recent draft Communications Data Bill.
 
&gt;As Liberty explain, the right to freedom of expression is crucial in a democracy. Article 10 of the Human Rights Act safeguards the right to free expression, which includes the freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without State interference. Whilst there are instances where the right to freedom of expression should be limited to protect the rights of others, I strongly agree that criminalising even the most unpalatable, illiberal and offensive speech should be approached with grave caution in a democracy.
 
&gt;Liberty have a informative webpage on speech offences that may be of interest: http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/free-speech/speech-offences/index.php.
 
&gt;I hope this is helpful and please be assured that I will continue to stand up for human rights and freedom of expression as your MP.  Thank you again for getting in touch and do let me know if you need further information.
 
&gt;Best wishes,
 
&gt;Caroline""",0,1354273196,null,0,1354273411,0,c792kx5,t3_140wem,t1_c792kx5,t3_140wem,null,1430540549,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

*Thank you for your letter. However I am little confused regarding your rejection of my appeal based on your assumption that I am withholding the details of the driver responsible for the fine. I am, on the contrary, doing all I can to provide you with the details of the driver however it is proving extremely difficult as he is a Belgian national and not a UK citizen.

Furthermore it would seem to be contrary to civil (contractual) law that you could continue to pursue someone who was not in receipt of an invoiced service, that is, a parking fee. As I was not the individual who enjoyed the benefit of the service I do not see how you can legally invoice me for a service that I did not receive?!

Contractual law does not permit the recovery of invoices from associated individuals unless the 'individual' was a business. As I understand it the law associated with private parking facilities is entirely covered by common law and in particular contractual law and not the Traffic Management Act 2004 that pertains to local authorities.

I would of course be happy to supply the details of the driver as and when they become available. I am making all attempts to find his details but these have so far proved inconclusive. *

* The DVLA will not give out details to a company that isn't a member of the BPA. 
* The BPA has stringent membership criteria which companies have to meet before it is granted.
* If the company is not a registered member you can ignore the ticket, it isn't legal and they can't track you anyway.
* DO NOT APPEAL if they're not members of the BPA. You are simply providing them with your contact details which they will use to chase you.
* Appeals have to be processed by an independent, third-party. Your appeal cannot be refused by the ticketing company themselves.
* If the company is on the BPA list, and it is a valid ticket, you have to pay it or face court. The old contract law doesn't apply. It is not a claim for loss it is a charge. 
* The ticketing company has 70 days to send you a letter. Outside of that is too long and you don't have to pay.
* Companies that don't abide by the rules of the BPA suffer a number of points, depending on the infraction, and can be suspended for a period of time once too many points have been accumulated. It works a lot like driver's licence points. 
* Previously, clamping and ticketing comapnies had to be licenced by the SIA. This is no longer the case, the SIA don't offer a licence related to parking anymore, and any reference by the parking company that they have an SIA licence is irrelevent and could be interpreted as fraudulent.

No, what gives meaning to money is the value we ascribe to it, saying that a beer is worth four pounds and handing over tokens to that value. 

If you take a £20 note to the BOE and ask for that 20 pound sterling (payable to the bearer on demand), they'll either laugh you out of the building or give you a promissory note or bearer bond - so youve just exchanged paper for paper. 

You dont *need* gold to have a functioning monetary system - not least because banks are leveraged so much. 

No, what gives it its value is productive output of the UK.

If you don't think framing is important then you have no understanding of how the debate around copyright has progressed over the years. The pro copyright lobby for a very long time has been using terms and words to frame the argument in the way that favours them. Copyright infringement equated to theft, the use of ""you wouldn't steal a car"" when talking about piracy, are the most blatant examples of this. 

Current copyright lobbies are talking about things like fair use rights as being ""exceptions to copyright"" which neatly implies that copyright is a default state. The truth is that copyright is an exception *to* the default, a government granted monopoly, and things like fair use rights are places in which copyright is not allowed to interfere with.    

Sorry to go on a bit of a rant there but ya, framing in this debate is incredibly important because we are dealing purely in concepts.

Firstly, are you in the unlimited broadband plan? (option 3). The others have usage caps, so you'll either be charged or have your speed capped if you exceed your allowance.

On the 'unlimited' plan, there is a fair usage policy...with an unspecified 'fair' amount. They do employ traffic management, but we don't even get told if it's for a particular type of website. The only thing I know for certain is that they will slow your speed if you're a particularly heavy user during peak times. This tends to be worse if BT are the only provider in your area, which is often the case is remote places. 

It may be that they're working on your local exchange to try and improve speeds in your area, that can cause lines to be unstable whilst the work is ongoing.

Try [this website](http://www.samknows.com) to find your local exchange via your postcode. It should tell you the exact distance and the technology available (Fibre, ADSL etc.)

If the line remains unstable and shit, you should be entitled to some form of compensation or a monthly reduction in the cost of your Broadband.

They are frustratingly secretive about the stability of lines and traffic management. If you use torrents or newzbin then chances are they'll choke your speed. ",0,1354276774,null,0,false,0,c792xxg,t3_13y566,t1_c792xxg,t1_c78ke6c,null,1430540716,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"Well it starts off with some people having a parade and an old woman complaining about it because it's rubbish. She says if she did it with her religion she'd be thrown out of the country. That just isn't true though is it? Lots of Christians march and protest freely in the UK, including some anti-gay Christians here at the Manchester Gay Pride festival last year.

Then it uses Anjem Choudary (spelt as Anjim for some reason?) as some kind of example of Muslim views when he really is just an extremist. He often praises terrorists, has been banned indefinitely from France (maybe other countries too?) and is generally just a bit batshit crazy. He lead Islam4UK, a fringe group which was eventually forcefully disbanded because of its links with terrorism. Not exactly a fair and balanced representation of Muslims is it? No point giving voice to a fringe extremist and using his words as a generalization to all Muslims.

&gt;It was a peaceful religious parade but it wasn't an experience that Blackburns non-Muslims can easily share. To white passers-by it may have seemed threatening.

Just like anti-gay Christian marches and protests are threatening? It doesn't really matter if people can't easily share the experience does it? If there was a lesbian group marching, men might feel that they can't share the experience, but it's not a big deal.

Then we have a woman saying:

&gt;The English nature is very laid back and apathetic really.

Is it? Speak for yourself love.

&gt;We have to fight for the things that make us English.

Times change. Identities shift and what makes us 'English' changes too. She seems to be implying that Muslims or non-whites can't be 'English'? I think? Either way what she's saying is subjective and can be discarded I think.

Then we have more from Choudary and what he believes. Who cares anymore?

Ian Goodliffe then talks about how Blackburn is segregated. No explanation for who he is so I don't see why I should care for his two sentences. 

Then goes to Nick Griffin talking about people like they're cattle. Saying then should put poor immigrants into places where the rich can afford to live. He touts this as if it's a great point 'hurr durr they won't like Muslims on their door!' but really his party would be the first to condemn giving immigrants expensive houses in London.

Then we go to 7/7. A terrorist attack done by 4 men. Nothing about the IRA and their bombings and terrorist attacks yet. I'm sure it'll come up though /s.

We then have two people in a pub talking about how their friends and mainly the same skin colour. Big surprise. Some guy called Paul hasn't been to an Asian guys house, and hasn't invited any Asians into his house. He thinks this is worth mentioning.

Then talks about the full veil and how it's proof that some muslim women want to be separate. Judging by the people in this video if I lived in Blackburn I'd want to be separate from everyone too.

Asks a woman if she considered what other people think about her wearing the veil, as if it's somehow to do with them. If I want to wear a hood then it's no one else's business and to try and impose a ban on what people can wear is pretty ridiculous in and of itself (including that guy with the pig t-shirt the other month)

Then there's something about a book that calls Jews and Christians pigs or something? Not too sure what this has to do with anything as controversial books have been released again and again. It's apparently being taught to kids? But I'm not sure in what school seeing as though all schools in the UK have to teach in English iirc?

Then it's a verse which says that other Gods are false idols. Like it says in pretty much every religion. Not sure what this verse is from? Is it the book? It's not the Koran obviously.

Ian Goodliffe (man in a pub? Who is he?) says that his kids won't marry a Muslim Asian, as if he has total control over his kids and can predict the future.

&gt;Muslim Asians now make up 2% of the population.

Am I supposed to be scared or something?

Then a woman says the people around her won't talk to her as friendly neighbors. She's hate living next to me then because I'd also ignore the fuck out of her.

&gt;Slowly getting swallowed up

They make up 2% of the population?

Then a guy says that kids in a primary school would have English as a second language and that's a concern. Surely the kids would be learning real English in a primary school? Which includes nursery usually?

Kind of stupid video tbh. Load of bullshit.

They calculate the risk and your premium is adjusted accordingly, similar to how the rate of interest on a loan is calculated.

When looked at from the viewpoint of a tight investment market, the insurance companies have to provide higher returns. That means premiums go up in the same way that banks insisted on higher rates of interest even though the level of risk hadn't changed.

Premiums don't go down across the board - they go up. If they went down, then Insurance companies wouldn't be worth investing in.

Of course spending £16k outright now (having no debt) is even worse. (as that properly invested will have a greater impact when pension time comes around).

My point is that, ""the burden"" while you may not notice now, and is almost of an irrelevance to you, does have an impact on your future spending power.

a debt of £50k, no matter how evenly distributed will still effect your overall economic spending power, if we have a generation gap one who has no debt, and one in which everyone starts with a £50k debt, the spending power is not the same between the two. as a result your likely access to ""reasonable housing"" will take the hit. (as the other generation has a greater ability to spend)

Seems like nothing now, but when you have kids and money is tight (it usually happens to everyone at somepoint), £150 a month or £200 a month is a major kick in the pants, also the effect and value of your degree will be a long distant memory, and you will be pissed off paying it each month)

In real terms, it is an effective way of ""value investing"" and increasing the overall quality of the squad in excess of our transfer spend. If this is done consistently, it is the only real way to get ahead once FFP is fully in play and commercial revenue has levelled off.

Now think about this: £5m = £32,051.28 per week for 3 years (interest effects ignored). 
In other words, buying a player for £10m and paying them £80k per week has the same expenditure effect as buying a £15m player and paying them £50k per week. Except that the cost is spread over the duration of the contract and the risk of making a loss if the player is sold mid-contract is dramatically reduced.

That wasn't part of the course, the students mostly had them already, and those that didn't, didn't learn them. My course was mostly about memorising long mathematical processes (like 'calculate how far beam X will bend under force Y'). I guess that sort of thing is easier to grade.

&gt; I'm well in favour of making people who study ""lesbian pottery"" pay for it entirely Themselves, i just don't want potential doctors who study but fail to be burdened with a lifetime of debt

I'm entirely in agreement there - and while it's hard to prove that any course is entirely worthless, I think the tax payer gets very little of real value from a lot of students, and that attaching a cost to the individual is a better filter than some government body deciding which courses should be allowed and/or setting a quota on courses where there's little real demand.

OTOH, I think the current system does a pretty good job of avoiding the 'lifetime of debt' problem that the americans seem to have. 

&gt; if it isn't a tax its a ""charge"" 

OK, but my point was that there's no reason why the 'tax' model has to to apply to higher education.

&gt; that is the very nature of tax

That's true but it still doesn't automatically make it fair.

I think the core of our disagreement is that you believe that the state usually gets good value from higher education and I don't. I think universities see students as a way to make money to fund research, and that most graduates use little of what they learned.

Liverpool give the illusion of domination. We had a 2 goal lead and they decided to tika taka between the back few, let them. For all of their possession they still had less shots on goal/target.

In saying that, you are spot on. Defoe offers nothing but a few goals, his inability to pressure the opposing team even without the ball allows them to push further up the pitch and lean on our defence. With a striker up front who can threaten aerially, hold the ball up, distribute and move around to open space up for our pacey wingers we will have more net offensive pressure.

true,Yst,dalek,Dalek,"&gt;&gt; No matter what the good Doctor has on his side, it's insignificant next to the power of the Force.  
  
&gt; He'd used his sonic screw driver to short out Vaders life support systems, can't use the force if you're dead.  
  
Both valid points.  Consequently, the conclusion everyone's driving at, but no one seems willing to come to, is this:  
  
1) Either one can disarm the other instantly, and kill them fairly rapidly.  
  
2) Neither one understands the extent or nature of the other's powers.  Vader doesn't know the sonic screwdriver poses any threat to him.  The Doctor doesn't understand the Force.  
  
Therefore, **the victor is simply a matter of who decides to act to kill the other first**.  As they're both cinematic characters, that's mostly a matter of whether Vader gets through his villain speech (""...power of the force...blah blah blah...evil will always triumph, because good is dumb"") before the Doctor gets through his good guy ""you can still be saved"" speech.  
  
Frankly, I think Vader would wrap up his villain business and kill the Doctor before the Doctor gave up on Vader's chance at redemption and killed Vader.  The Doctor never gives up on the possibility of redemption.  Particularly where galactic supervillains are concerned.

Having said that, it's difficult for anyone to score without proper service from midfield, and with the Mbia-Diakité combo that worked well against Sunderland, hopefully we'll be able to boss the middle and prevent him from getting too much service.

Granero had a pretty poor game against Sunderland -- he's looked a bit off for a few weeks now, hasn't he? -- so I would quite like Faurlin to have a chance to start. 

I also hope 'Arry gives Fabio a chance to play. Mbia did his job well at RB against United but I was surprised that Bosingwa was preferred to Fabio against Sunderland. Imo, Bosingwa is one of those players who looks like he really doesn't give a toss about where the club ends up. Fabio has a point to prove to SAF. 

Anyway, I'm hoping for and predicting a resurgence, with Benteke getting a cheap one off a corner (as usual), but QPR ultimately prevailing with a 2-1 win.

Of course millions of people don't have a mortgage, or for whatever it's not possible to extend - so this is another option. Also, people are less willing to do that if they plan on moving within the payback of the measure. Whereas with GD the loan remains at the property. 

Think of buying a car - you go into a garage, pick a car that you like, and the garage will ask you how you're planning on paying. Some people pay cash, some arrange a private loan, some get finance, or a mix of all three. Yet with expensive energy efficiency measures, there isn't really that latter option. 

The idea is that yes - you would have to save more than £275 a year to be eligible for GD finance. External solid wall insulation should save around £475 a year. So you'll be net better off by £200/yr. There is another aspect called the 'occupancy test'. This looks at how a home is currently heated. A family of 4 may save more than a single person who may move into the home at a later date. You would have to sign something to say you understand that the savings may be less than £475 if you under heat the property. 

There are also plenty of non-economic bonus reasons to get this work done. The main one in my experience is thermal comfort. Your quality of life is likely be higher in a home that is less draughty and easier to heat (and retain heat). People invest in double glazing for precisely this reason - it's often done in the name of 'saving energy' but DG will never ever recoup its investment, payback is around 60years, lover than the life of the product. Yet millions of people still invested because double glazing provides a much high level of thermal comfort than single glazing, and it often looks nicer. This is why solid wall insulation will work and with high levels of ECO funding will make it available to millions of people for the first time.

I think the website which says 'buy the paper' is kind of emblematic of Hislop, and his attitude towards Leveson. His entire career is and has been ripping in politics and the media, but you also get the impression that he is a man of that world. He is not a radical, he is not activist, he never seems too concerned that reforms go through. In fact, you get the impression that he has grown up in an environment that he hates, but has also kind of grown to love. He likes exposing this sort of media bullshit, but doing something meaningful to actually combat it would be, er, not cricket. He would rather carry on playing the game.

That doesn't mean that Private Eye isn't excellent, and Hislop an important figure, but it does mean that he shouldn't be considered the oracle of all things.

As for why someone would agree to rent a property with a GD charge. Say you go to a letting agency and they have two identical properties on the same street. One is cold, draughty, has a 1970's boiler and very little insulation. The other has a modern combi boiler, newly renovated (insulated) walls and floor insulation. It's cosy, quick to heat up and retains heat for longer. When you ask what the bills are like between the two, they tell you the latter is actually cheaper on a monthly basis, but £40/month goes onto a Green Deal charge. Would you care and which would you be likely to pick? I've lived in both types of property in the private rented market and life is pretty miserable in cold hard to heat homes. I would pay more on a monthly basis just for the improvement in quality of life. I never want to see ice on the inside of my windows ever again. 

From the landlords perspective they have to put no money in themselves up front, and their property is (arguably) easier to rent. 

I sound like I'm in sales for the GD, I'm not. I work on behalf of the consumer and we're working extremely hard to make this a good thing for people to do. I've seen pilot trials of 'pay as you save' type schemes, and they can work extremely well. I want it to be available to everyone in the UK and particularly those in the private rented market who have been criminally ignored for so long.

What this means is that what people are expect from the industry but are not getting are what piracy provides them with. Which is to say they want instant and easy access to the content they want when they want it and do not want to be restricted in how they use it.

This report suggests that the industry could see more revenue if they dropped prices because their volumes of sales would dramatically out weigh the reduction in per person revenue. Yet the industry is insistent on attacking rather than attracting the markets best consumers while not giving up the mindset that per person revenue is the key.

true,BrokenClockwerk,lfc50,,"A lot of us hope that Liverpool is coming out of decline at this point, after a few seasons of fuck all. A lot of people have covered it, but here's my take.

Rafa's last season was not good. We had a lot of factors going for us in the 2008-2009 season, when we finished second, but they all started to fall apart in the summer of 2009. Our offensive firepower was built around Xabi Alonso's passing and ball-retention skills, Gerrard's runs and defense-splitting passes, and Torres' finishing. These three players all worked together extremely well and were the driving force behind our success in 2008-2009.

The loss of Alonso in 2009 was a huge blow to our team. I'm trying to think of a comparable player to Arsenal now, but I'm not coming up with a good example. Maybe compare Alonso's influence to Arteta's. He kept the midfield ticking and was the starting point of all our attacks. With Alonso gone (and no replacement, for Lucas wasn't ready at that point), our Midfield was significantly weakened.

Unfortunately, Gerrard, the second part of our important three, also dropped in form somewhat that year, probably because without Alonso to cover him, his defensive vulnerabilities were showcased, forcing him to devote more attention to that aspect of his game. Without his driving runs and splitting passes, we lost a fair bit of goals (16 goals in 31 games in 08-09, 9 goals in 33 games in 09-10). Torres actually had a better goal return in Rafa's last season than in our 2nd place season, but he was injured for some of the season and suffered from fitness problems.

Our 09-10 team should have made top 4, though it was weaker than our team the year before. Torres' injuries, Gerrard's loss of form, the sale of Alonso, as well as a general poor play, made the perfect storm for our failure that season. From then, it was a quick descent as Rafa was fired.

Hodgson was pretty poor at motivating the team, and that summer we lost good players like Mascherano, Benayoun, and Riera, and only bringing in uninspired players like Poulsen, Koncheskey, Jovanovic, and Joe Cole. Gerrard had injuries, meaning that the team's entire offensive weight was on Torres, who buckled under the pressure. His goal and assist rate halved in the first half of the 10-11 season from what it was a season earlier.

Hodgson left, and Kenny came in and sold Torres and Babel for Suarez and Carroll. Both looked good, but Carroll came with an injury, and Suarez needed time to gel with the rest of the team. We improved under Kenny, but still didn't get where we wanted to be. In that summer transfer window, Kenny and Comolli completely overhauled that team's style. Under Rafa, we'd predominately played a 4-3-3 or a 4-2-3-1. Hodgson had done away with that, but we arguably still had the players, but Kenny brought in players for a strict 4-4-2. This didn't really work, as he played Henderson (as well as Kuyt) at RM, and Bellamy at LM sometimes. He brought in a lot of players who underperformed (Downing, Henderson, Carroll), and adhered to his strict system, even when it wasn't working. Suarez' suspension and Lucas' injury didn't help either, which led to our diminished form.

Hopefully we hit rock bottom last season and will be back in the race for top 4 soon, but that's basically my thought about our team composition and managing status. I don't have much to say about the owners, since I'm not as familiar with out last owners financially, and FSG's money policy has been covered pretty well.",0,1354292492,null,0,false,0,c795o8o,t3_141mws,t1_c795o8o,t3_141mws,null,1430542000,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

I think that is why he was so maligned for so long. He looked for the forward pass way too often. In '10-'11 he found such a great balance of forward passing and plain possession, all the while developing better defensive angles to take when tackling. 

Almost most impressive is how few times he goes down. Looking at other defensive midfielders is that they win the ball by going down. It results in more dangerous looking tackles, even when you win the ball. This is also looked upon favorably with the ref, who will be more willing to let the play go when you don't go to ground.

He always times it so his previous mark is not in a threatening position or will be unable to receive the ball.

true,Tven0,english,Warwickshire,"*Liberty must be limited in order to be possessed* - Edmund Burke

**To be truly free, the irony is you must show some control and restraint.** In day to day life we limit our freedom by going to work to earn money. This in turn allows us more freedom. We can buy and do many things with that money and have a life with it.

This quote by Burke also applies to the press. To be truly free to pursue stories to their fullest extent, journalists need to have some legal guidelines. If you cross over into illegality, the story is dead or questionable anyway. This requires some serious regulation and support by the law. I am in favour of statutory press regulation. The new regulatory body needs some teeth. The reason for this is that over the past 70 years the problem of press behaviour has been questioned time and time again.

The 'trial by press' in particular has just got to stop. Here's why: 

- Peoples lives are being destroyed before they even get to trial.
- Media behaviour is misleading police lines of enquiry. The Jefferies case is an example of this. The press focused on this man, and so did the police. It sent the police investigation way off course because everybody was focused on this 'wacky ex-teacher'. Meanwhile, the real criminal was providing false information to the police and reinforcing the red herring.
- Phone hacking, tampering with evidence of crime and payments to police is the highest form of corruption possible and these businesses went and did it. 

All of this must **never** happen again. The new regulatory body needs some teeth, some power behind it, to ensure it stops.

true,Yellowbenzene,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"Liquid nitrogen is at several hundred degrees below zero.  Usually it evaporates immediately on contact with skin, separated from it by a thin layer of gaseous nitrogen which stops cryogenic burns from occurring.  If a large amount is placed on mucosal surfaces (mouth, oesophagus, stomach) then it can destroy tissue.  Not to mention the explosive increase in volume as it changes state from liquid to gas. 

This girl underwent major upper GI surgery due to this (don't know exactly what, but it would seem that gastric and oesophageal perforations would be likely) and will probably have lifelong problems with eating as a result.

In my opinion, liquid nitrogen being used anywhere in a bar is just ridiculous.  This girl probably chucked back the entire cocktail before the nitrogen boiled off.
