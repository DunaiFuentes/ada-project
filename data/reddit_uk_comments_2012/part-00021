I like the Donna idea. Always have, but it bothers me that when we see the Woman talking to Wilf throughout the story, she's rather cold to him and there's no familiarity. If it had been that long since she had seen her grandfather, I think she'd have been much warmer to him.

The writers could do so much with Donna at this point, it's a shame they probably won't. Is she capable of regeneration now? Is there any way her brain can adapt itself to the Doctor's knowledge?

But anyway, we were talking about Donna. Since she got Time Ladyfied in 'Journey's End', perhaps that gave her an alternate history as a Time Lady. This is pretty contradictory to her primary history, and so would be too much for her mind to handle if she could remember both. So The Doctor makes her forget. But perhaps one day the tides of wibbly-wobbly-timey-wimey are more favourable, allowing her to reconcile her two natures. She could then join the high council as 100% Time Lady, if she suppresses the fact that she's also 100% human.",0,1330087752,null,0,true,0,c3uitcq,t3_q3wp5,t1_c3uitcq,t1_c3uiq2g,null,1428411991,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

Well it's not impossible that at some point she remembers, or the Doctor finds a way to bring the memories back without killing her and she decides she's of more use on Gallifrey than traveling with him.

You know the JSA is completely shit right? If you're trained in any sort of specific industry (that isn't cleaning, baking or retail) there is no way in hell they will help you find a job? Retail won't hire someone who's worked 5+ years in IT for example.

Why should they have to attend courses? The last time I used JSA they forced me attend a MS Word course. Why on earth? I'm a computer scientist... I know how to use word. Isn't it cheaper just to pay JSA then send people on a superfluous course they don't need? Oh wait.. someone is getting government money for providing those courses? That doesn't even go into the actual course being absolutely shit (worse than school IT) and full of chavs talking about they ""merced some brudder up init"" (the point I got up and left the course and they cancelled my JSA). 

As another example. I programme computers. But I would have no problem at all being a cleaner. Every college, school and hospital around here hires cleaners. Every single one is a black woman. The person who hires them is a black woman. If you're not a black woman you're not going to be hired as a cleaner...

My favourite are the ones that reference surveys in which the product being advertised was recommended by 83% percent of people, and then the small print comes up saying something like ""83% of 47 readers of a magazine which told them this product was good agreed that this product was good"".

Anyway to return to the point, when I see one of those slick adverts with the creepy looking old people talking about how their website has sliders (yay for standard UI elements that have been in widespread use for decades!) and then the small print comes up saying ""Representative 4214% APR"" I think how you'd have to be incredibly stupid to be taken in by it. And yet the fact that the adverts are still running clearly indicates that they are still in business. This leads inescapably to the conclusion that they are taking advantage of vulnerable adults: namely the extremely thick (or ""people who suffer from learning difficulties"" if you want to be PC) and the mentally ill.

mao_was_right argues that capping the interest rate would cause these companies to go bust. I agree and am therefore in support of capping the interest rates. If insurance companies can prevent young people from driving by making it unaffordable for them to do so, I see no reason why the state can't use the same trick to stop glorified loan sharks from ripping off idiots, nutters and old people.

The problem is not so much that there aren't any jobs available, it's that you have to compete for a limited supply of jobs, and there is always someone better than you. This means that no matter how well qualified and experienced you are and how much effort you put into your job search it takes time to get hired. JSA is specifically intended to help you afford little luxuries such as food and electricity while you look for work.

Let us consider what would happen if we did it your way and simply said ""get a job you scrounger"" and withheld any financial support. Yes I'm sure the desperation of impending starvation would incentivise them to apply for every job out there. They might even get lucky and get hired within a couple of days (although this is unlikely as most hiring processes last weeks).

More likely though, given the currents state of the job market, the initial applications would be met with either rejection letters or simply silence. Then what? I know what I would do if I were faced with starvation. I'd do whatever it took to survive, even if that meant resorting to crime.

Consider the economic cost of crime. The immediate costs of theft and destruction of property are just the beginning. You've also got the expense of time and resources spent by the police and courts and then finally you've got to put them in a prison at an average cost of £47,000 per year [according to the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12879042).

And the food is way better!

The downside is that private hospitals don't have any regulation for staff standards. Private hospitals have been known to retain off duty GPs to supervise intensive care units at night, and to use junior doctors to carry out procedures that would be supervised by a consultant in the NHS. 

The same lack of regulation applies to private ambulances. These have been known to carry cardiac patients with no oxygen on board, and are sometimes ill maintained.

And if things go really horribly wrong, you're often better transferring to the nearest NHS hospital which is likely to have much more experience at running an ITU and dealing with serious emergencies. If you're thinking about using a private hospital, ask about transfer times to the nearest NHS hospital.

Saying things doesn't make it true. Landlords take on a reasonable amount of risk from bad tenants, empty months, maintenance, etc. They make profit but it's probably in line with the kinds or returns you're expect from any business. When I looked into becoming a landlord the most I could get out of it was 10% RoI which isn't amazing given the added risks. One bad tenant who wanted to squat there for 2 months would have decreased the ROI to something like 7% and that's before taking into account court fees to remove them.

*spoilers, of course*

We know that River was kidnapped as a baby as part of a grand scheme to kill the Doctor, but we don't know the details of that scheme or what the Silence's larger goal is.  We don't know what happened to River between the time she was kidnapped and the time she was ~7, except that some amount of that time was spent in that spooky orphanage.  As far as I can tell, we don't even really know why the Silents needed to build that space suit apparatus (except that for some reason they seem to have needed it so that River would technically be the one to kill the Doctor, although we still don't know why it had to be River or even why the suit they put her in to do that had to be a space suit), let alone why they tried to put River in it when she was ~7.

We do know that the Doctor told them 1969 was their next stop before they watched him get shot (presumably because he remembered it from ~200 years earlier in his time stream), which is how they know to insist on going there next.

true,Kitten_paws,null,null,"I am quite a sickly person. We went on holiday to Cuba this summer and I needed admitting to hospital for several hours to treat a stomach infection. They had a doctor and 2 nurses with me for the full 6 hours, made sure I was comfortable, gave me a sedative because the medication was harsh, brought my partner a bottle of water and some food and the TV was in English. When we were going to leave they wrote on the papers I'd been there for 2 hours and it cost £70. Anything over £100 and they deal directly with the travel insurance company. As a condition of entry you need travel insurance, but all companies provide it. 2 weeks was £50, even though I have arthritis and take low dose chemotherapy and have depression. In comparison my nan got a cut on her finger that needed stitches and an xray in the US and had to pay over £500 and in the end she only got it taped up, same amount of time too, 6h. Cuba was clean and the staff were so friendly but in the US my nan felt scared and the place had sticky floors. 

We were chatting to the Cuban doctor, since they have a system similar to ours, healthcare is free, and he was saying how he'd treated several Americans with serious problems who'd neglected them through cost, but their travel insurance covered it so it worked out cheaper to get it fixed there. Crazy. 

Last week I had to go to the hospital with a head injury, the nurses were incredibly nice and supportive, the doctor examined me and checked my abdomen since it appeared bloated to him (no complaints in the area) and he took a urine test, turned out I had a symptomless bladder infection, took the antibiotics and unfortunately it spread to my kidneys, but I know I'd be a lot more ill if he didn't check me over on the off chance. My medications are ridiculously expensive (Had to buy them over the counter in Spain, my partners nan was good friends with the pharmacist and sold them at cost and it was still around £70) but I pay £120 a year for a pre-payment card. 

Only complaint I have with the NHS is how hard it is to get an NHS dentist around here. It's around 8 to 10 months wait to get assigned to one now. Every day I hear people complain, but I know we have incredibly good standard health care, some of the best in the world. Okay we may have to wait a bit, but if that's a problem you have the option to pay for it. A friend of mine just did for a broken finger pinning because he didn't want to wait 6 weeks. I like knowing that even though I don't pay anything due to being a student that if I need an organ transplant or end up in a severe accident I'm not going to be chased by the health service for the money which could leave me homeless. I also like that even though I have health problems and disabilities I can still have national insurance that covers these problems.

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"Speculation aside (I don't think this question will ever be answered), I think it was just lazy writing from Davies. He's a phenomenal screenwriter, but there's something very amateurish about introducing a mysterious character at the climax of a finale with no explanation of who she is, how she can travel from the last day of the Time War to speak with Wilf in 2009, and what becomes of her after it's all over.

Davies would *have* to leave her identity to speculation because he painted himself into a corner. The only way out of the Rassilon-Doctor-Master standoff was to quickly write a one-scene character in, have her show the Doctor what to do, and then not even write her out again.  Just...gone. 

For what it's worth, I don't like the idea of her being the Doctor's mother. I do enjoy the hints he drops about his family, especially as he gets older - 7 said he didn't know if he had a family anymore, 9 said he knew what it felt to lose a family in a war, 10 said much the same thing, 11 simply changed the subject - but something so clear-cut as ""this is the Doctor's mother"" is too much. 

Especially because if this show is about the Doctor, you *do not* introduce the man's mother at very nearly the last minute, and then completely forget about her just so you can give everybody else a happy ending (Mickey and Martha, Jack and Alonzo, Donna and her husband). 

Lastly, I don't think his looking at Donna was meant to imply she was his mother, his wife, his daughter, his granddaughter, or any other female relation. I think he was simply changing the subject.

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"&gt;If you voluntarily agree to do it, and you don't drop out in the first week, but drop out after, then you lose the benefits for a short period - that's the only way you can lose benefit entitlements.

Er...no. You also lose benefits if you refuse to take part in the programme. Here's the quote you're talking about:

 ""The scheme is voluntary and no one is forced to take part and the threat of losing the benefit only starts once a week has passed on the placement - this was designed to provide certainty to employers and the individuals taking part.""

which s funny because it quite literally goes against everything we've heard from actual people in this scheme.

Here's a quote from the guardian:

&gt;""Despite DWP rules, Reilly says she was told by the jobcentre that she would lose her benefits if she did not take the Poundland placement. The DWP says jobseekers should be told about the cooling-off period but was unable to comment on individual cases without being given personal details.""I was told [the work experience placement] was mandatory after I'd attended the [retail] open day,"" she said.

Let's not forget this very important part about what the DWP has said:

&gt;""However, the DWP has clarified that **there is a clause which allows jobcentre case workers around the country to force unemployed people into placements.""**

Here's another quote from the guardian article:

&gt;""Rayburn, who was also told by his jobcentre he would lose his benefits if he did not work without pay, said he spent almost two months stacking and cleaning shelves and sometimes doing night shifts.

&gt;""They said [my JSA] would be cut off if I didn't do it.""

&gt;Asked if he thought he should have been paid, he said: ""I reckon they should have paid me … I was basically doing what a normal member of staff does for Tesco. I had the uniform and I was in the staff canteen. I obviously got access to the food and drinks in the staff canteen … that's what they let you do … but I got nothing else apart from that.""

&gt;""Like Reilly, Rayburn was not told that he had a week to refuse the placement. He was working at Tesco with two other young unemployed people who did get a job at the end of their placement.""

You're right, there is a lot of misinformed idiotic rage about this scheme, by people who don't understnad what's really going on and what is really the problem. Ask yourself these honest questions. Why the fuck would anyone take 4 weeks of unpaid work experience at a for-profit company and then complain about not being paid? Why would they be docked their JSA if they volunteered for the scheme and were under no obligation to do it? Isn't that just harming those who want to better themselves?

It's definitely not the only argument against getting people to work for for-profit companies instead of charities, but to say that the jobcentres staff all over England 'accidentally' mis-advising workers to force them to take part in this scheme isn't an argument against this scheme, is just plain wrong.

&gt;if you think the second is relevant.

Of course the second is relevant, it is exactly the problem with this scheme. That we have people who are unemployed being lied to by the jobcentre staff 'accidentally' to force them to work for no pay.

&gt;you also have to take at face value the testamony of a people with an obvious axe to grind.


If this system wasn't being abused, why would there be an axe to grind? Surely if it wasn't being abused everyone doing this work experience would be happy to do it? After all they 'expressed an interest' (whatever the fuck that is supposed to mean i don't know) so why would they be complaining if they were given all the facts about being able to NOT do it.

&gt;The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) says that if jobseekers ""express an interest"" in an offer of work experience they must continue to work without pay, after a one-week cooling-off period or face having their benefits docked.

I don't think we can really trust what the DPW have to say about this seeing as though they've already said:

&gt;However, the DWP has clarified that there is a clause which allows jobcentre case workers around the country to force unemployed people into placements. The DWP says that once people ""express an interest"", including verbal consent, in doing work experience they will lose their JSA if they pull out after their first week into the placement.

Which tells us that:

A) They can force people to take these unpaid positions.

B)'Verbal consent' is all that's needed to decide that someone should be signed up to this. They don't even have to fucking sign anything saying they agreed to it. Verbal consent can be interpreted in SO many different ways and it's alarming to me that they don't actually need to sign any written agreement.

and

C) That apparently the workers can quit after one week without losing their wages.

I have a serious problem with C because it begs the question as to why exactly someone would ever go for this scheme if they didn't face a penalty for not doing so. It also goes against all the (anecdotal) evidence from people i work with who say they were faced with losing their benefits. Their testimonies happen to line up nicely from every other persons testimony who's worked in this scheme, and i think that raises some serious questions.

It's pretty obvious this scheme is being abused, and if you think that doesn't raise an issue with the scheme itself, then you're not looking at the bigger picture. Why is such a large and polarising piece of legislation or whatever open to such abuse? Why isn't it properly controlled and maintained, or even properly worded?

Torres then handed in a transfer request and all the club could do was maximise the price and line up a replacement (Carroll). The deal for that was completed on the evening of the deadline.

There have been numerous stories of the news of people younger than 18 starting up a business and it making a fuck ton of money. Christian Owens started the website Branchr at age 16 and it made £500k in the first year.

I think the reason a lot of people don't think they can set up self employed is down to mental attitude. I would imagine after months of unsuccessful job seeking you've a fairly well engrained ""I'm obviously of fuck all use to anyone"" attitude.

I'm having difficulty working out how you make a profit out of this.

If you have someone with low assets and a poor credit rating it's a bad idea to lend them money as even if they default it's really hard to collect and you could easily end up not being able to recover the additional costs your incur while chasing it.

The only way I can see this working is if you find someone with moderate assets but a poor credit rating, but as it's an unsecured loan there's no easy way to hit the house and if you push them into bankruptcy you're unlikely to recover all your costs.

However, if you get charged £30 for going £1  into your overdraft then suddenly a 5 day loan at 4000% apr looks the much better option.

These companies play a necessary role in the credit economy and the solution is not to attack them but to attack the reason that they are so profitable, namely the poor financial planning education which exists and a culture of consumerism which causes people to believe that possessions they can not afford are essential.

The Doctor is killed by adult River, as seen in TWORS—they need the suit because River Song would never willingly kill the Doctor. As she herself says in TIA/DOTM, the suit can move and offers life support: River never shoots the Doctor, she only happens to be inside the suit. Both the “little girl” and “Mel” incarnations of River failed to kill the Doctor when their timestreams crossed and the Silence can’t mess with that without ‘punching a hole in the Universe.’ (on the other side, this is why Amy and Rory can’t get their baby daughter back.)

They find the little girl in the astronaut suit only by chance. They are sent in 1969 by the Tesselector Doctor, who needs to put himself into the path which will lead him to find the “miniaturised cross people.”

They are using the suit as life support for the little girl. I can’t really see Silents feed and nurse a baby girl.

They are rising her to become the woman who kills the Doctor. This is where it does get kind of wibbly wobbly, as this story is clearly not finished yet. Previous stories of the 2005 reboot have described a fixed point in time as an event that must always happen, like Pompeii—events whose repercussions are so big the Universe can’t compensate around changes to them, not without the creation of a whole parallel reality.
The Silence religious order needs to kill the Doctor to prevent him to fulfil the prophecy and answer the oldest question in the Universe. To do this they need to create an enormous chain of events that can only happen if River kills the Doctor. Moffat will never answer this, but I like to think it is the adventurous love story between the Doctor and River that fixes that point—but we now know that the fixed point is rather the astronaut suit shooting the Tesselector.

A fan could love the character, and think it would be awesome to see how the Doctor's personality and story develop if his next regeneration is a woman.

We've already seen the Doctor change a lot. Just bringing him back in the 2005 season changed him massively. In Classic!Who he was always the Time Lord underdog, the (relatively) young rebel in exile in opposition to what for him was the ancient and rigid Time Lord authority. Now they're dead and he *is* the ancient Time Lord authority, the only one left. 

He's gone from being the youthful (for a Time Lord) underdog to being one of the oldest and most powerful and lonely beings in the universe. That's a huge change. 

But we need changes like that, because the show's nearly 50 years old. If the Doctor's character didn't get reinvented on a pretty regular basis, the show would have gone stale and died decades ago.

Most companies check up on your history before they will hire you. For some it's as simple as checking a reference or two. Banks are rather more stringent because they don't want to accidentally hire someone who is likely to start siphoning money out of their accounts. In addition to a CRB check and a credit check they want evidence of my activities for the last 3 years.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's a good question, and one that has been dealt with by academics. The answer is quite simple; religious identity has always been a more central element of Unionism than it is of Nationalism. For Nationalists, the dominance of the Catholic Church was never an important aim. The central aim of Nationalism was the creation of a single ""Irish Nation"", consisting of *both* Catholics and Protestants (whether they liked it or not). The Irish tricolour (the Nationalist symbol) represents peace between Catholics and Protestants. 

For Unionists however, ""Irish"" identity was strongly associated with Roman Catholicism and they were very suspicious of Roman Catholicism as an ideology. This was a strong component of their resistance to a ""United Ireland"". As Dr Marc Mulholland; Lecturer in Modern History in Oxford University put it: 

&gt; The overt sectarianism of loyalist violence had a significant
purchase on unionist tradition. Anti-catholicism was historically
central to unionist psychology, in contrast to the avowal, indeed
insistence, of nationalists and republicans that all inhabitants of the
island, Catholic and Protestant, were part of the nation (whether
they wished to be or not). Protestants, however, considered that
catholicism was an autocratic belief system, superstitious and
conspiratorial. It made Catholic Ireland effete and inferior. 

&gt; In 1964,
for example, John Brooke, son of Prime Minister Lord
Brookeborough and later a Unionist MP, explained that: ‘The
leopard does not change his spots. The Roman Catholic Church
demands loyalty to the Church, which modifies loyalty to the
state.... Our discrimination is not against Roman Catholics. We
are trying to prevent the Roman Catholic Church in its
determination to destroy Ulster.’ Ian Paisley, a fundamentalist cleric
given to raging against the ‘Romish whore’ and ‘anti-christ’ (the
Pope), was throughout the Troubles the single most popular unionist politician. In this context, it is little surprise that virulent
sectarianism could tip over into murderous rage.

But if you commit an offence in the US, even while in another country, they can try and extradite and charge you for that offence (if they have an extradition treaty with the country you're in). The implicit agreement would be; you want to buy our stuff? You have to follow our rules.

We have export laws too, governing which countries our arms industry is allowed to sell too. If we sold to one of them, and then they sold some sensitive material in it on to a third party, we'd be fairly pissed too. But the Americans are super-paranoid when it comes to technology transfer.

I mean, most people can't afford $400-600 for a non-costume suit they'd wear regularly, let alone spending that on a costume they might wear twice a year (at best). Particularly since we culturally no longer wear suits as a staple (unless you're in corporate finance or similar executive positions). 

I read that he had to use 5 pairs of Gap pants to make the brown suit jacket, plus another pair for actual pants -- and neither the fabric nor the pants are still available. He said that even trying to find the pants on eBay is unlikely. And IIRC even many of the ties are discontinued and nearly impossible to find used. Maybe a handful of ties might be found, compared with the hundreds (thousands?) of people dressing up like The Doctor.

So accuracy is unattainable by 99% of people pursuing a 10th Doctor costume. Which means cosplayers are then free to aim for the more realistic ""in the spirit of"" or ""similar in style to.""

An agency only exists to send you warm bodies which may be capable of speech, them being able to do anything useful is a massive bonus. You can give an agency extensive requirements and they'll still send you a meat popsicle.

In 2006 (back when I worked for a giant corp) it got so bad that we agreed with the agency that we wouldn't pay them for the first day someone worked for us as we ended up firing most people within an hour or two.


The cost of a new hire is somewhere in the region of £10K-£15K (in my industry) once you've taken into account staff time training them, time spent interviewing and the general loss in productivity until they're up to speed.

Does Sinn Fein not have strong ties with the Catholic church? I always assumed that they did.

There isn't (that I know of) any Unionist/Protestant equivalent to this sort of tight integration between church and state.

I think each iteration of The Doctor gives a new set of people the opportunity to discover the show, as well as offers a figure that previously unrepresented fans can connect with. I've been reading the essays on each Doctor over at [Den of Geek](http://www.denofgeek.com/television/1167835/doctor_who_a_celebration_of_christopher_eccleston.html) (scroll down for the link list) which has made that fact very clear.

So why not break out of the straight white male trend? Socially speaking, Doctor Who inspires such strong emotional attachment for people, what's the harm in offering a character that different individuals can finally relate to? Why deny them that? Creatively speaking, why would the writers want to limit themselves to decades of regenerating as straight white men? 

I mean the Doctor can theoretically regenerate as *anything* -- any race, age, gender, orientation, weight, height. That opens up an entire world for the writers. Imagine the new possibilities for interactions and discoveries if the doctor were Black or Asian or female or fat, for example. 

Plus, The Doctor is inquisitive. Wouldn't he at some point in 900+ years want to know what life would be like as something else? Wouldn't he want to know how that would physically feel, how others would respond to him? Whenever he regenerates there's a joke about ""ooh, new teeth"" or ""huh, different voice"" and how strange that feels. Imagine how he'd respond if suddenly his voice were high and female, or his skin were a different color.

The idea is an infinite toybox that could help keep the show fresh over the next decade. So it's baffling to me how rigidly some fans want to stick with the old formula of Doctor Who = White Male.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"&gt; Considering a Prospect Magazine/Yougov poll showed 80% of people think that those who have been out of work for 12 months and are physically and mentally capable of working should do something for the community in return for benefits, the fact that virtually no pro-workfare/working for benefits comments gets a score higher than zero must show that most people here are on the dole with no intention of looking for work despite their bleating, whining and protestations.

80% of people might agree with community work, but working for a huge corporation like Tesco for free is not community work. It is, however, removing a few legitimate jobs from the economy and causing slightly more unemployment.

It is like this: Tesco jobs are always filled, they are always over-applied for. There is no shortage of people willing to work at Tesco. However now Tesco has a permanent turnaround of people working there for ""free"", meaning they can run their business with less full-time employed staff. The people they eventually give jobs to is irrelevant as those jobs would be filled anyway, it's not as if people are gaining valuable skills through this which they can then use to get a job in a skilled workplace where the market is lacking skilled labour.

So yes, I agree somewhat on the community work idea (put me down in that 80% if you like), but completely disagree with the shit that is happening right now.

This scheme should both a) get people experience doing something useful that can be applied in employment, and also b) do things that wouldn't otherwise be done, so that people don't lose employment over it. Good honest community work can legitimately boost an area, community, the whole country in fact - but that isn't what is even happening here. All it is doing is harm.

The main problem you seem to have is that you're older and lived through worse times than today, therefore think everyone is ""lucky"" - but guess what: so were you compared to 50 years before, and 50 year before that, and 50 years before that, etc. Just because shit used to be worse does not mean people should accept it today - we should be working towards a better world for everyone, not throwing it all by the wayside because of your bitter memories of the past.

And the problem you have with Reddit seems mainly that you don't like the youth of today who use their brains and are aware of how badly they have been shafted by *you* - that is, the portion of the former generation who thinks like you do and would rather attack those currently less fortunate rather than attempt to solve any prevalent problems.

But all you would rather do is spit out some baseless argument based on some dodgy statistics that you clearly didn't spend more than 2 minutes thinking about before writing your angry rant, because if you did you would have noticed the inherent flaw that I imemdiately did - and you used *that* as a premise for your entire argument.

Opinion based on unverified assumptions. 

In regards to the latter point; Sinn Fein does not have particularly strong ties with the Catholic Church and is often extremely critical of the Catholic Church. For, example, in regards to the CC's attack on homosexuality SF stated: 

&gt; ""The reactionary and homophobic teachings of the Catholic Church on this issue are the real threat to society, not same-sex marriages. Sinn Féin fully supports the right of same-sex couples to marry and adopt children and calls on the Government to introduce legislation to this effect, which we would be happy to support.

&gt; ""For the Church to suggest that allowing children to be adopted by gay couples is tantamount to acts of violence against children is especially nauseating, coming as it does from an organisation whose institutionalised cover-ups of terrible acts of violence against children leaves it with no credibility on this issue.

Unionist politicians tend to fall on the completely opposite end of the spectrum. For example, in 2005, DUP Councillor Maurice Mills claimed that Hurricane Katrina was sent by God to the United States as an act of judgement upon those who practise sodomy.

In 2007 Ian Paisley, Jr.  stated during an interview that he was ""repulsed"" by homosexuals. In 2008 Iris Robinson famously said ""I have a very lovely psychiatrist who works with me in my offices and his Christian background is that he tries to help homosexuals - trying to turn away from what they are engaged in"". And Peter Robinson backed her up stating; ""It wasn't Iris Robinson who determined that homosexuality was an abomination, it was The Almighty.""

These are the sort of religiously-motivated, homophobic statements which you just don't hear from Nationalist politicians. 

In regards to your claim that attendance of mass is a ""considerable part of everyday life"" of NI Catholics/Nationalists. This is just silly and is again totally unsupported by the facts. Studies have found that the biggest decline in Church attendance is among Catholics: 

&gt; Patterns of church attendance show a consistent decline, away from regular attendance (defined here as weekly attendance or more frequently) and towards less frequent attendance (such as once a month or less). Figure 3 shows that in the late 1980s, around two thirds of the population attended church at least weekly; by the early 2000s, this decreased to around half of the population, a significant decline in a relatively short period of time.
Which denominations account for the declining frequency of church attendance? Regular church attendance (defined as at least
weekly attendance) has declined
among the three major denominations, Catholic, Presbyterian and
Church of Ireland (see Figure4). However, the decline has been greatest among Catholics, traditionally the most diligent church attenders.

&gt; There isn't (that I know of) any Unionist/Protestant equivalent to this sort of tight integration between church and state.

This is a strange claim considering the largest Unionist party was co-founded by a Protestant reverend. Furthermore, there have been some high-profile cases of Unionist politicans trying to push the teaching of creationism into public education. In 2007 for example DUP MP David Simpson, asked for assurances that students who gave creationist answers to examination questions would not be marked lower for it. [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/education/tussle-of-biblical-proportions-over-creationism-in-ulster-classrooms-13479246.html] 

In 2010 DUP MP Nelson McCausland asked Northern Ireland's museums to include creationism in their exhibits. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10159667] 

Research by the British Centre for Science Education in 2006 found creationist belief to be higher among Protestants than Catholics, Roger Stanyard stating ""One of the most shocking aspects of life in Ulster for the outside visitor, is the grip fundamentalist Christianity has upon the Protestant community."" Some of the findings from the study include: 

&gt; Moreover, creationism is unlikely to make any significant inroad into the Catholic population of the province. They account for about 44% of the population. 
&gt; ...For the most part the churches we identified in Northern Ireland as endorsing creationism mostly described themselves as Presbyterian but were not mainstream Presbyterian. 
&gt; We identified not a single Church of Ireland or Catholic Church that endorsed creationism.


[http://www.bcseweb.org.uk/index.php/Main/CreationismInNorthernIreland] 

And in a 2010 update they stated: 

&gt; If someone in Northern Ireland standards up and says “I am a creationist” or ""I don't agree with Darwin"" it means they are Protestant.

&gt; Of the several hundred creations in Northern Ireland that the BCSE has identified, not one is Catholic and every single one looks to be to be a practising Protestant. There are no Catholic creationist organisation in the province and no Catholic churches (or any other Catholic organisation) have endorsed it. Not one.

Probably no other character in history is as variable as the Doctor. I've heard regeneration described as being like instant reincarnation, without the inconvenience of amnesia or having to be a baby again. We get to watch him literally become a new person again and again, always the *Doctor* but always a new variation on what that means.

And the nature of Doctor Who is that the Doctor is always, unavoidably, the center of the universe. Of course he is, he's The Doctor, that's the point. But when the Doctor, this ancient and very alien being, always presents as specifically a white man, that means something for the audience. When he can be anybody, and when he's not even human and our social classifications theoretically mean nothing to him, why is this the default mode he always has to adopt?

Why not have this infinitely variable character present his very alien nature in another form? Especially with the TARDIS frequently traveling to the 21st century and earlier, the Doctor as another gender or race or ethnicity opens up so many directions for plotlines and character development. Infinite toybox is right - why waste this amazing potential?

I think this is the direction the show is heading. The writers have definitely written in the possibility of the Doctor regenerating as a woman, it's an option now. 

And the show has become the gold standard for integrating LGBTQ people and plotlines into a sci-fi universe. We have some of the best damn writers in television working on this show, with a rare combination of talent, guts and budget.

I'm not relying on anything. I don't care either way. It's been my personal experience, nothing more.

&gt; Opinion based on unverified assumptions.

Which I deliberately qualified as an assumption. I didn't state it as fact.

&gt; In regards to your claim that attendance of mass is a ""considerable part of everyday life"" of NI Catholics/Nationalists. This is just silly and is again totally unsupported by the facts.

The typical Protestant attends church once on a Sunday morning and that's pretty much the height of it. Catholicism is a lot more 'involved' and tends to pervade people's lives to a greater degree. There's Lent/Ash Wednesday, Solemn Novena, confessional, [more frequent services](http://www.gotobelfast.com/welcome_to_belfast/religious_worship_times.aspx) etc and more subtle observations like having no meat on a Friday. There aren't really any equivalents in the Protestant faiths.

&gt; Studies have found that the biggest decline in Church attendance is among Catholics

The biggest decline yes, but still, from the same report, Catholic weekly Church attendance is ~65%, Presbyterian 40%.

Given the more frequent attendance, Catholic schools and a greater adherence to religious practices in general, and

&gt; The reactionary and homophobic teachings of the Catholic Church

that's why I said

&gt; Seems strange then that Unionist parties exhibit more of a religious taint than Nationalist ones.

If both religions generally present as anti-gay, or at least resistant, then it's strange that Unionist politicians tend to have a much worse track record when it comes to these issues than Nationalist.

&gt; There isn't (that I know of) any Unionist/Protestant equivalent to this sort of tight integration between church and state.

I meant the fact that there are Catholic schools specifically. When we hear of the education system discussed, they mention primary/secondary/grammar/Catholic as separate entities. 

&gt; These are my biggest problems with this post:

Not so much this post per se, but pretty much any political post in this subreddit. You can't really present an argument without it sounding biased. It dilutes everything. A neutral reading your post may glean from it that you're a Nationalist Sinn Fein voter who doesn't particularly like the DUP. That's great, except it begs the question, did you omit quotes that you knew would compromise your own argument based on your political/religious preferences? I'm not saying that you did, or if you did, that it was deliberate, but when I read any post here it always hangs in the air.

There's a nice middle ground, you see. 

In a landlord example the landlord gets to charge x amount, with a y profit.  Anyone with enough money pays the landlord for his services and all is well. 

If someone doesn't have enough money, then the government pays the landlord to let them live there. Landlord still gets y profit and Mr Poorpa still gets housing. 

There's no problem with this system that needs changing. Sure, the government is paying out money, but it all eventually comes back through taxes anyway. Income tax first, VAT and other covert taxes second. The government doesn't lose out substantially. 

This way it also gets to limit its exposure to what is essentially a very expensive asset. A boiler goes, a roof needs fixing, yadda yadda. They government doesn't need to care. 

It also doesn't need to pay for the added bureaucracy that a government run business would cause.

There's nothing drastically wrong with our current housing system. Certainly nothing that would warrant nationalisation, which, btw, would be totally impossible given that you'd be nationalising probably in the tens of thousands of peoples privately owned enterprises. 

It's not like banks, or mines, or car factories. It just wouldn't work, and thats something the far left like yourself are always guilty of. Not being realistic and actually contributing viable alternatives to the status quo. 

The far left are always fixated on radical change, but radical change has pretty much never worked anywhere. Just look at Egypt for what happens when the left demand radical change right now..  Nothing. Nothing happens. Everything pretty much stays the same because no one knows how to deal with this new change they made.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; A neutral reading your post may glean from it that you're a Nationalist Sinn Fein voter who doesn't particularly like the DUP.

Let me just start of by saying that I'm an atheist Green party voter (and member) who's perfectly happy to stay in the Union for the time being. My problem is not with Unionisn it is with people giving inherently biased and unsubstantiated responses here. I mean you say that it is just your experience and not fact; well then why even contribute it as a response if it just your opinion (which is largely based on inaccuracies and misconceptions)? Why not do your research and offer responses based on solid evidence? What are you even basing your opinions on if not objective facts? 

I mean it's things like this: 

&gt; I meant the fact that there are Catholic schools specifically. When we hear of the education system discussed, they mention primary/secondary/grammar/Catholic as separate entities.

A total misconception. The facts indicate that 90%-95% of students in NI attend either a Catholic or a Protestant school.[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60718-1006.htm] 

[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:2YJ6ITgk1iIJ:eprints.ulster.ac.uk/15407/1/SEP_policy_briefing_1.doc+eprints.ulster.ac.uk/15407/1/SEP_policy_briefing_1.doc&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiUe7ojSos0kgbX4iwHj1RGsYIGP2Qpl8jq4qpRaWOUh2IGF8pgqEWObfTmdmb83hSrUlcKijtRn9t7MtTLMaCOeevAgUWN9KvuNg2vp--MJ8l3wUm0iaMexrrJvnDWn94MWQ4m&amp;sig=AHIEtbTmFX4shUxwuljjbGcjMWhK7BskDg] The problem is that most of the Protestant schools are run by the state (and are hence classified as ""Controlled"" schools). But they are ""de facto"" Protestant and were originally run by the Churches before control was handed over to the state. The Presbyterian Church, the Church of Ireland and Methodist Churches, known as the ""transferors"", maintain a link with the schools through church representation on controlled school boards of governors. For this reason, ""Controlled"" schools are obviously not popular with Catholics and most Catholic pupils attend ""Catholic-Maintained"" schools instead. NI has an extremely segregated education system. 




The statistics for 2011/2012 show that there are 51,463 Protestant pupils in  ""Controlled""  primary schools out of a total of 55,441 Protestant pupils altogether. The rest attend either ""Controlled *Integrated*"" or ""Grant Maintained Integrated"" schools. There are only 3,877 Catholic pupils in  ""Controlled"" primary schools (out of a total of 78,737 Catholic pupils), the majority are in ""Catholic maintained"" schools.

&gt; The typical Protestant attends church once on a Sunday morning and that's pretty much the height of it. Catholicism is a lot more 'involved' and tends to pervade people's lives to a greater degree. 

You are trying to say that Catholicism, by its nature, is more involved in people's lifes. Well, this may be so, but how is this relevant? For a start, the report I posted indicated that Catholic participation in Church and in the religion generally is declining at a rate faster than any other religion in NI. I mean do you seriously think that the average Catholic family doesn't eat meat on a Friday? And what is your definition of a ""typical"" Protestant, because the research indicates a huge increase in creationist belief among Protestants. 

But more importantly it's not even relevant to the OP's question which was about the religiosity/conservatism of the *political parties* specifically, not the average citizen generally. The DUP and UUP *are* registered centre-right and the SDLP/Sinn Fein as centre-left. You didn't even try to address the reason for this difference other than saying that you find it ""strange"" from the context of your, appartently uninformed, perspective.  

And another example: 

&gt; If both religions generally present as anti-gay, or at least resistant, then it's strange that Unionist politicians tend to have a much worse track record when it comes to these issues than Nationalist.

Again, totally missing the point. The OP's question was *not* about the perspectives of the different religions, it was about the religiosity of the *political parties*. By saying that it is ""strange"" that the Nationalist parties have a better track record when it comes to things like homosexuality - when the Catholic Church is so anti-homosexuality - you are assuming that all Nationalist Politicians are practicising Catholics who follow what the Church says. This is a totally unsubstatiated assumption. The whole point of OP's post was that Nationalist politicians tend to be less influenced by religion and more left-leaning on the political spectrum. The evidence indicates that religion tends to be more central in Unionist politics than it is in Nationalist politics. Why is this? You've not tried to answer this. Only greggtheregg so far has offered an objective explanation of what the OP actually asked.

My daughter's course is over 24 hours, whilst the boyfriends is closer to 12.  The JC allowed him to sign up for JSA since he was only studying 'part time' as long as he continued to look for work.

So in January he gets the offer of a job at B&amp;Q for 8 hours a week on the weekends.  He tells the JC about it and they tell him that he'll just need to bring in his timesheets on his normal sign on dates and give them a copy of his pay slip so his JSA can be reduced to match.  Again, fair enough, he's earning money so his JSA should be reduced by the amount he earns.

Last week his advisor tells him that he's either got to stop signing on, get at least 16 hours of part time work or quit the job, or drop out of college or they'll be assigning him to workfare.  

So we've got someone who's studying a useful subject, whilst also working to provide for his family who's being told if he wants any help he's got to quit college or quit his job.

Go to a cricket match.
Go to a football match.
See a pantomime.
Play bowls.
Play darts in a pub.
Eat black pudding, liver and onions, fish and chips, a cream tea.
Learn how to make a proper cup of tea, in a teapot. Take home as a souvenir a tea pot, a tea cosy and some tea.
Hear a brass band
Go to London by all means but don't spend all your time there.
I liked the Cambridge suggestion.
I liked the seaside suggestion.
Get to the north, it's very different to the south. Someone suggested Manchester which would be fine but stay out of the centre (all big cities get pretty much alike in the shopping areas). Better still go into the wilds of Yorkshire or Lancashire or the North East. Maybe visit Hadrian's wall, Durham cathedral, Bamburgh castle, Finchale Abbey.

DON'T SAY YOU VISITED BRITAIN IF YOU STAYED IN ENGLAND.
England is cool and there's loads of great things to do and see, but the UK also includes Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, all of which are also cool with loads of great things to do and see, and are all different from England.

WALES
See a rugby match
Don't stay long in Cardiff, get to the north and the wilds.
Go to a pub in a tiny village and hear Welsh spoken. Don't assume they only started speaking Welsh when you came in and don't assume they're talking about you.
Wales has the best castles in the UK and some of the best beaches. Try Conwy or Aberystwyth for a bit of both.
Go on a steam train in Llangollen
Eat cawl, bara brith, Welsh cakes, laver bread
Hear a male voice choir
Participate in a gymanfa ganu
Prepare by reading some re-tellings of tales from the Mabinogion, the tradition myths and legends of Wales. But don't try to read the Mabinogion itself unless you are very dedicated.

SCOTLAND
(I have never lived in Scotland and haven't visited extensively, something I'd like to rectify)
By all means spend quite a bit of time in Edinburgh, it is so much more than ""yet another big city"".
Scotland has some corking castles, if you'll be in Edinburgh make sure to include the castle in your tour.
Get up into the mountains and experience the remotest parts of the UK. In a tiny island, this is the furthest you can be from people and it really feels like it.
Hear some traditional music. Scots music is amazing.
Hear languages spoken - Scotland has the most diverse linguistic landscape in the UK with Scots Gaelic, Scots English and Lallans spoken in addition to English. Don't panic, everyone speaks English too (although you might not recognise it as such at first)
Visit the Western Isles, the Hebrides, the Shetland Islands.
See prehistoric ruins.
Eat haggis, arbroath smokie
Drink whisky of course! Visit a distillery, maybe whilst you are in the Western Isles where they make my favourite whiskies. Buy a bottle of whisky as a souvenir, and collect water from the burn that feeds the distillery to dilute it with (just a splash) when you get home.
Also drink Irn Bru.
Do you like golf? If you you must play golf in Scotland.

NORTHERN IRELAND
(I have never lived in Northern Ireland or even visited it, although my dad lives in the South i.e. Eire. So these suggestions are based on general knowledge rather than first hand experience)
I'd like to see the Giant's Causeway, the mountains of Moune, Lough Neagh, Fermanagh, Derry. Maybe you'd like them too.
Drink Irish whiskey and compare it to Scots whisky.
Drink Guinness.
Hear Irish traditional music played live in a pub. The best damn music in the whole world.
See prehistoric ruins.
If you ask me, the traditional food of Ireland has little to recommend it. There are only so many ways you can combine potatoes, bacon and cabbage. But by all means eat soda bread, champ, colcannon, boxty until you have had enough carbohydrate to last a lifetime.
All the TV adverts for Ireland feature horse riding, often along beaches. I don't know why. Try horse riding along a beach in Northern Ireland and tell me whether it's all that special.
Prepare for the experience by reading some of the traditional myths and legends of Ireland, which deserve to be every bit as well known as the legends of King Arthur, or Beowulf, or Greek legends or anything else the world can offer in the realm of tale-telling. If I say ""one tribe stole some cows from another tribe"" you'll be amazed that this mundane story can be spun into a tale that knocks spots off The Lord of the Rings.

But there are specific issues with the NHS, for instance, it cuts costs by putting referral decisions solely in the hands of the doctor, who must balance a budget, rather than the patient. That leads to a paternalistic, somewhat contemptuous attitude, because doctors are constantly having to rebuff patient appeals, and are reluctant to have to explain their justifications for a decision, which may be financial rather than medical. I'm sure that's quite similar in America, where it's the insurance company rather than the doctor watching the budget, but I'm comparing with France, where patients hold their own medical records and can self-refer to anyone within the health service, meaning that doctors act more as cooperative advisors rather than adversarial gatekeepers.

The road grid system is perfect, keeping traffic running smoothly 99% of the time, there are very rarely any traffic jams. However, public bus transport is joke, which is more frustrating given how well the roads are designed for buses. Clean air and low pollution. People generally seem more grounded than other places I've lived. There is also a ton of green areas and lakes. 



The bad points raised against MK are usually pretty spot on. Yes, it does lack a bit of soul, but some of that is down to the fact that it is still a fairly new town of about 65 years. Because of this, it lacks any kind of classic architecture that builds character.  The main thing for me is the huge cultural black hole that exits. The culture of Milton Keynes is shopping. Spend spend spend. If people say MK is souless, this is truly where that stems from. There's only one theatre. Very few galleries or museums, and if they are they are dotted around away from town. Practically zero gig venues that would attract any signed bands. The bars and clubs are full of absolute twats, built on a culture of boy racers (with a few exceptions) and there's really not much else to do.

When there seems to be no realistic chance of prosecution in the UK because of legal precedent, or unfair investigation techniques, the fall-back is extradition.

true,Antagony,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire Pudding,"The fact British citizens can be extradited without a British judge having even examined the evidence against them is utterly ridiculous and needs to be fixed. However, I am quite disgusted by the apparent anti-American rhetoric that is routinely bandied around whenever this topic is discussed. If I were American I think I would feel deeply insulted by the commonly implied notion that non-Americans cannot possibly receive a fair trial over there. Their system of justice is not that dissimilar to our own, so I guess the supposition here must be that we are somehow a more fair minded and less corrupt people than they are. But I see little if any reason to believe that.

Let's be honest, neither of us have a perfect legal system – far from it in fact – because whether a trial is conducted here or there, being able to afford the best lawyers is by far the biggest advantage a defendant can have if the evidence against them isn't rock solid. Wealth based justice is of course unfair, but that is the reality on both sides of the Atlantic and I see nothing to suggest the Americans are any worse than us in that respect. 

Moreover, everyone seems to be assuming he will have to plea bargain regardless of whether he is guilty of anything or what the evidence against him is, but I don't see why that should be the case. If he is innocent and his lawyers do a good job of rubbishing the evidence, why would he not be set free and exonerated?

All of that said, there is one area where I think we probably do have a moral superiority over the Americans within our respective criminal justice systems, and that is in prison conditions. If reports of conditions in their jails are anything to go by, they should be considered a violation of human rights and I pity anyone who gets incarcerated in them. For that reason alone I think we should be far more reluctant to grant extradition to America – or to *any* country with reportedly brutal prison conditions, for that matter – than we currently are.

EDIT: A rough sketch of the background to this.

With Toby Young writing a column for the Sun on Sunday, Linehan accuses him of being ""a standard troll selling your mediocrity to a man who tried to cover up the hacking of a murdered girl's phone"" and of being ""London's village idiot"".

The spat continues with Young responding,  ""don't begrudge others' success because you think it should be you and no one else rolling in money. That way madness lies"". Linehan asks him to ""go away and start trolling and lying for the Sun. A marriage made in heaven"".

Young accuses Linehan being uncharitable towards him and then makes the statement in the link.

Following this, Young attempts to strawman/change his argument from hacking to voicemail deletion, to suit (and despite) his assertion that the phone hacking elements of ""the murdered girl thing"" had ""turned out to be balls"".

Young cites this article  http://www.theweek.co.uk/media/phone-hacking/43516/dowler-false-hope-messages-were-not-erased-notw  and attempts to claim that he was referring to the deletion of voicemails (despite this not being the original accusation). However, said article states:

&gt;But officers working for the Operation Weeting inquiry into phone hacking revealed late last week that while the paper's reporters were likely to have caused the deletion of some messages from Milly's phone, the specific “false hope” incident, when Sally Dowler discovered her daughter's inbox had been emptied, was not committed by the paper.

Worth noting that only changed tack towards ""message deletion"" once he was accused of phones being hacked. Either Toby Young was trolling, strawmanning or being remarkably thick (to put it charitably) by arguing against a point that no one had made.

What brains would those be? Many on Reddit seem to be illiterate halfwits incapable of spelling simple four and five letter words. In this subreddit there must be maybe 10% who actually have enough mental capacity to form opinions and arguments of their own. The other 90% merely click an upvote or downvote button or regurgitate what the 10% have already said, whether that was right or wrong.

The same halfwits who bleat on about workfare taking a paying job away are too fucking stupid to realise that someone doing things in the community such as litter picking, removing graffiti or repairing a playground are doing exactly the same as the council have people they pay to do that. So by getting workfare participants to do these ""community projects"" the council don't need to employ people. 

As I said, and that you too seem too stupid to see, apart from education anything you do which involves people on a scheme doing a task is putting someone out of work or removing a possible employment position.

However I decided not to submit it because according to the same page the Work Programme is a collection of activities and it wasn't clear from the description if it was mandatory for participants to do unpaid labour.

The DWP's Work Programme Provider Guidance document makes it clear that the ""work experience"" activity is in fact mandatory and is conclusive evidence that every politician who has claimed it is voluntary is a filthy liar.

The worst thing in my view is that it makes specific mention of undermining minimum wage laws.

Its the same with savings. Every single person is entitled to a tax free savings in an ISA. Why do you have to stick it in an ISA? Why can't HMRC just make the interest from the first £5340 tax free?

The brains to come to the conclusion I just did: to see through your false statistics, and to tell the difference between community and corporation.

Plenty of /r/uk are working professionals, by the way - much of the community are web developers and other IT professionals. Sure there are plenty of unemployed people here too, but that only makes sense - unemployment is high, and unemployed people do generally have more time. But the opinion on Reddit is generally that of liberals, not that of the unemployed - which is why me and many other employed people I know on /r/uk are also against the way this scheme is being run.

And you're entirely wrong about the community jobs - the council employs people but it doesn't have the budget to do as much as could be done - with community workers it would be a huge boon to everyone, but with Tesco they only have a fixed number of positions.

Also, even *if* community work removed council jobs, that is still more of a benefit to the community as that council budget is our tax money at work. That would leave the council more money to spend on .. dun dun duuh - the community! Not pad out an already padded Tesco CEO's bank account.

If you really can't tell the difference between community and corporation then I suggest you stop talking now before making an even bigger idiot of yourself.

The biggest problem here is that you've come to many completely incorrect conclusions - the biggest seems to be that you think only unemployed people hold these opinions, which is quite simply *massively, massively* wrong.

Believe me, if you actually formed a proper argument that made sense, didn't rely on falsities, and didn't jump to nonsense conclusions, then people here would both listen and many would even agree.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  If you are using a limited company as a way to avoid paying tax at the full rate, you are abusing the system. It's simple.

So every single business in the UK, even down to the local newsagents is abusing the system then?

By the same argument so is everyone who puts their savings in an ISA instead of a regular savings account because they're using an allowance provided by HMRC to avoid paying tax on income (the interest from the savings), exactly the same as every ltd company, sole trader and every single person in business does - even a window cleaner.

&gt;  They do not provide limited companies for that purpose.

Ltd Companies do not apply any tax allowances that anyone can't apply themselves. ""Ltd Company"" is merely one way of forming a business, the same way ""Partnership"" and ""Sole Trader"" is. I am self employed as a sole trader. I can apply exactly the same tax allowances that I could trading as a Ltd Company. The only difference is if my business goes to shit with a load of debt I am liable for the lot whereas I wouldn't be with a Ltd Company - I'd just be liable for the initial investment. Many people on PAYE can apply the allowances if they're applicable to them the same as a Ltd Company can. In fact thinking about it, a Ltd Company isn't able to apply some allowances that an employee can as they only apply to individuals such as the allowance for washing a work uniform.

Corporation tax is 20%, the same rate as basic income tax so there's no advantage there. If you're an employee of your own ltd company, as well as paying normal NI, your business would pay employers NI at 13.8% on the wage you draw as well so no advantage there.

TBH I am at quite a loss as to what loopholes you think are being used by Ltd companies for avoiding tax that nobody else can.

true,ourbees,null,null,"So I went a bit nuts last night trying to get to the bottom of what's happened here. What I have come across might well be the most convincing conspiracy theory and confidence trick, ever.

So I started from looking up this Riyadi and seeing that the Federal Bank of New York list his name as an ongoing scam moniker, alongside another scam about supposed secret, high-denomination Fed bonds dated 1934. Like the bonds referenced by Lord James, these are supposedly backed by bullion and were purchased by the Indo/Chinese tongs.

The Japanese guys arrested crossing the IT/CH border with $134billion in counterfeit US treasury bonds, were, according to the scam/conspiracy theory, financial agents of the Japanese treasury which is under the secret control of the White Dragon syndicate. The Japanese treasury was supposedly trying to liquidise one-third of it's dollar bond holdings under the global financial radar as punishment against the American ""satanist illuminati"".

The White Dragon are ""represented"" on the internet by one Benjamin Fulford (and this part is sadly real, Fulford was the Asia chief for Forbes magazine, and shot to fame in conspiracy cirles with his absurd claims - and a video interview with David Rockefeller in which Fulford claims White Dragon ninjas are preparing to ""pluck the eye out of the pyramid""). Still with me? 

So, with the Japanese guys under brief arrest and the bonds confiscated, the White Dragon are obviously pretty pissed. The executor of their capital funds, one Neil Kennan, actually opened a federal complaint against the UN, the Trilateral Commission and the Vatican (again, sadly all too real, the full complaint is avaliable from online dockets, here is a [summary](http://www.courthousenews.com/2011/12/05/41930.htm)). Named as an agent or facilitator to the trade alongside Benjamin Fulford is Leo Zagami, who in real life was a European house DJ seeing small success in his native Italy, Zagami also shot to fame in internet circles thanks to his also absurd claims about the Vatican, the Illuminati and the Masonic Lodges (holding some popular intrigue in urban Rome due to the notable public assassination of Vatican's chief banker in the 80s and the Freemason arrests made).

This whole thing is a scam, a massive scam. The billions and trillions ""held by the Dragon syndicate"" in City fraud, is paralleled in conspiracy cirlces by the [""Office of International Treasury Control""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_International_Treasury_Control) - our Foundation X from Lord James' previous speach. Seriously, read around that wiki link to see just how many governments and corporations have fallen or almost fallen for the scam. The entire nation of Fiji apparently was exposed in 2006, and what Lord James is saying shows he too has fallen for it. 

I think what we have here is a scam with billions of dollars worth of conspiratorial intrigue and mystery. It could easily be proven that Alan Greenspan and Geitner and the executives of HSBC and RBS did not sign what Lord James says they did, and that the documents he hold are similar to [these](http://pppkingdom.wordpress.com/2011/06/17/bill-hayward-johannes-riyadi-hsbc-london-1t-pof/).

true,[deleted],null,null,"You really are clueless aren't you? 

Dividends are the **post-tax** profits of a company, which are distributed to shareholders in proportion to their percentage holding in the company. Post tax means **AFTER TAX HAS BEEN PAID**. The company has already paid 20% tax on the dividend you draw. 

You are then liable for income tax on the dividend you receive:

* 10% on dividends for income received below the higher rate income tax threshold (£35,000 for 2011/12).

* 32.5% on dividends for income received above the higher rate income tax threshold.

* A new 'additional' dividend tax rate of 42.5% applies to individuals earning £150,000 or more.

So say you pay yourself £20,000 of the ltd company's profit as an income. You've already used your tax free allowance as PAYE so that £20k is taxable.

The company has already paid or will be paying 20% (£4000) in corporation tax on that £20k you draw as a divvy.
You are liable for 10% tax on it (£2000).

So for that £20,000, HMRC receives £6000 as a combination of corporation tax and income tax. FIFTY PERCENT MORE THAN YOU'D PAY ON PAYE.

**HOWEVER**

The actual rate of tax you pay in dividends will be lower than these headline rates, as dividends automatically receive a 10% tax credit. This takes into account the fact that you will already have paid corporation tax on your company profits.  

So, for lower rate taxpayers, you will have no further tax to pay on dividends, as the 10% tax credit cancels out the 10% 'dividend ordinary rate' so for the divvy you've drawn the effective total tax rate on that money is 20%, **EXACTLY THE SAME AS PAYE.** 

For higher rate taxpayers, you dividend tax liability will effectively be 25% so the effective total tax rate on that money is 45%, **MORE THAN PAYE.**

For any dividend income falling within the new additional rate band, the effective tax rate on that proportion of your income is 36.1% so for the divvy you've drawn, with the corporation tax the effective total on that money is 56.1%, **MORE THAN PAYE**

**SO THE TAX AVOIDANCE LOOPHOLE YOU THINK EXISTS DOESN'T ACTUALLY EXIST BECAUSE HMRC HAVE ALREADY CLOSED THAT LOOPHOLE MANY YEARS AGO WHEN THEY RAISED THE CORPORATION TAX LOWER RATE TO 20% SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF THIS**. You used to save money doing it years ago when corporation tax lower rate was 10% but thats not been the case for quite a long time now.

So in short, you don't actually pay any less in tax than you would on PAYE and once you reach the higher earnings limit you actually pay more tax. Where you save is on NI, thats all.

Everyone who says ""The advantage is that you pay less tax because you take income over minimum wage as dividends"" might as well hold up a big sign saying ""I don't have a fucking clue what I'm talking about.""

Lampard might be old, but he's still a far, far better player than Meireles will ever be.  It's pretty clear that the only reason Lampard is getting benched is because there's either a falling out between him and AVB, or AVB favors Iberian players over domestic ones.  Thanks to Bosingwa's absence, we were actually able to keep possession more often than not.  Most of our attacks were great, and had the type of pace and gusto we'd expect from the Chelsea of olde.

However there is a part of me, and of everyone I know, that does kind of hope we could do it successfully. That we could pull it off and become a bit like a Scandinavian country. Small, wealthy, healthy, happy, well educated. We have a good deal to offer the world and I think the populace is liberal and forward thinking enough to allow us to at least have a good attempt at it.

Thing is though, we haven't really been told how it would work out in the real world. There are tonnes of questions that haven't been answered. There are large things we would lose and so far the SNP (The Political Party pushing the idea) have just kind of stuck to the ""*We could be like Sweden!*"" lines. 

What currency do we use? Do we get the oil? What about the Scots in the military? Will we join Europe? Will taxes go up? Will business' stick around? Will we still get the BBC? None of it has been even remotely addressed and when you look into these types of things.. chances are none of it ends particularly well for us. There is a very real chance we would become a pathetic backend nobody with no money or resources. 'Least we'd have Whisky and Tourism.

Also, Alex Salmond (The SNP leader) doesn't really seem like the right guy to lead us to this utopian independence. I get the overwhelming feeling he wants to do it just so he can be *the* guy who made it happen, not because it's actually a great benefit to our people.

And if you *do* train someone, the chances are good that they will leave soon afterwards as you can be outbid by a company which has lower costs because they don't train anyone.

Something does have to be done, but I'm not sure what. The government could give companies tax breaks for training people, but employers will inevitably game this.

Back when I started out, the public sector had enough slack to train people. I don't think that happens any more.

I'd say my favorite Doctor is the seventh Doctor. Now, I told myself when had I started watching classic those months ago that I wouldn't pick a favorite. I wanted to love all the Doctors. And I do. But the seventh has stolen my heart.

He's got a dry humor with a dark Time Lord power underneath, and of course, a kickass companion. By dark Time Lord power, I mean that during the seventh Doctor's reign you got the feeling that while the seventh seems like a goofy dusty professor on the outside, sometimes you can tell there's an undercurrent of something. This something is alien, it's terrifying, and it's dangerous.

My favorite companion...that's too hard for me to choose. There are lots of fantastic companions, the Brigadier, Sarah-Jane Smith, Donna Noble, Ace McShane (the 7th Doctor's).

Favorite creature/alien/enemy is the easiest! My favorite enemy is Davros. I love that guy to bits- I'm drawing his Julian Bleach version. Second up is the Daleks which I also love to bits. I'm building myself a 1/2 scale cardboard model.

Favorite episode...definitely way too hard. There are 784~... I really like Battlefield, Remembrance of the Daleks, Genesis of the Daleks, Spearhead from Space, Face of Evil, Dalek, Human Nature/Family of Blood, Jubilee (radio drama), The Girl Who Waited, The Doctor's Wife, Vincent and the Doctor, Waters of Mars, Impossible Planet/Satan Pit.

true,slam_meister,null,null,"There's lots of interesting stuff to do here but it all depends on how much time you are planning to spend in the city.

For the casual tourist here for a couple of days, there are thousands of pubs and bars that have great stuff on all the time and plenty of attractions to see like the National Museum (which has very recently been renovated and is well worth a visit), The castle (just so you can say you saw it, but its also really quite cool) and the ghost tours of Edinburgh's underground.

However, if you are staying for any length of time you can really get under the skin of some of the weirder stuff here like the Royal Museum of surgeons (kind of like a carnival of medical horrors in a really fascinating way), or the Camera Obscura up by the castle.

Pubs I would recomend include; The Blind Poet - for a mid afternoon drink and great banter with staff and regulars, The Brass Monkey - for their film nights and cheap lunches, and the Banshee's Laberynth - a nice rock pub during the day that does clubbing nights later on. Also the Captains Bar is a FANTASTIC tiny little bar with great live music nights (make sure to ask about William McGonagall there - Scotland's, and possibly the world's worst/most genius poet). Also if you end up in Leith, ask a local how to get to the Roseleaf bar for slightly more pricy but good food and drinks.

For Clubs in May try out the Bongo club for interesting independant clubbing (make sure you know what's on before going though as it changes style dramatically every day, and they also run a very popular Ceilidh on tuesday evenings which it well worth going to), and Sneaky Petes - a much smaller venue but with a good atmosphere and fun nights.

At all costs avoid The Hive (or ""The Dive"" as its known to many locals) as its very much a last stop shop for the desperate.

For eating out, try the Mosque Kitchen - very reasonable prices for a good curry, or The Blue Moon Cafe for excellent food (a gay pub with great service, good prices and very friendly).

Also, Make sure you head up Arthur's Seat to be able to get a great view over the city as a whole and walk up Calton hill DURING THE DAY (its a notorius dogging site at night but has great veiws in daylight over the old town).

Also, go and visit the Hume monument http://web.uvic.ca/~rutherfo/hume.html to see where David Hume, Scotland's greatest philosopher is buried, and take a wander down towards Leith for a taste of the more ""rustic"" side of the town but make sure to choose your pubs well down there.

true,Noodlehands,null,null,"I didn't see the ITV coverage, however, I did see Newsnight and their claim that there had been 200 or so tweets, yet that actually related to the hashtag 'welfaretowork'. The tag 'workfare' had far, far more than this.

This also serves to devalue the discussion, and the medium (twitter), by excluding those who debated it, shared information and whatnot on that medium without attaching any particular tag whatsoever. This includes people who have been involved in the schemes, those ""actual people you see on the streets in the UK"".

The point I am making relating to the Workfare issue is that there have been attempts to represent those who show concern or dissent over it have indeed been tarred as being of the extremist left wing and/or belonging to the SWP, when the reality is that most do not belong to any organisation.

There have also been some interesting points put by Full Fact, which was started and is still ran (iirc) by a former SPAD to Margaret Thatcher:

http://fullfact.org/factchecks/benefits_work_experience_scheme_participant_outcomes-3340#overlay-context=node/3342

No doubt there will be people who support the SWP, Socialist Party who 'target' Reddit. The same can be said of a whole host of groups, and to suggest that users will be unable to take a breadth of facts, conjecture and general info without being somehow swayed in a way that is malign and towards ""black and white debate"" is a bold suggestion at best. Also, I think you over estimate how popular and well known the various sub-reddits are in the UK. Not that this is a good thing.

Lastly, I'm not sure how the Daily Mail naming 'the socialist party' and the news naming 'social media' pulls anything together at all, unless social media is somehow a direct link to Socialist Party ideals.

There was an interesting post elsewhere on Reddit (maybe UK politics) that was entitled 'A Case For Workfare'.

Yes like all corporate welfare, unless your company is a part of the scheme, it becomes a competitive disadvantage. As Hammyman eludes to further down, a company is normally liable for all sorts of things and the associated costs by employing someone. 

If one company can do away with things like employer NI contributions, minimum wage, the cost of running PAYE, in a part of the workforce which has low skill, high employee turnover, then their margins are lower. Especially when you have an almost limitless supply of forced free labour, and where Government is practicably undercutting traditional private agency workers in the marketplace.

For the record, there are several interesting passages, but the one which everybody always quotes opens like this:

""There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international Anglophile network which operates, to some extent, in the way the radical Right believes the Communists act.  In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table Group has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists, of any other groups, and frequently does so.  

I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960's, to examine its papers and secret records.  I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments.

I have objected, but in the past and recently, to a few of its policies (notably to its belief that England was an Atlantic rather than a European Power and must be allied, or even federated, with the United States and must remain isolated from Europe), but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wished to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.""

First, because Reddit has adopted the attitude that women deserve whatever happens to them on Reddit, because men are to be excused of any and all poor behavior.

Yes, perverts exist everywhere. But smacking down people who speak up against perverts puts you on the side of... you guessed it... the perverts. I honestly, seriously doubt that's your intent.

In other words, posts like yours make it worse because they don't just keep the status quo, they actively shut down anyone who tries to call out trolls and creeps. It puts the focus in entirely the wrong place, criticizing the victim instead of the perpetrator. **Most importantly it reinforces that this kind of behavior is normal -- when pedophilia, hebephilia and ephebophilia are very much NOT normal healthy sexual behaviors.**

Geek guys are constantly complaining that there aren't enough women who share their interests. Is it really any wonder when their fellow men create a sexually threatening environment, then justify or dismiss those actions. Worse, when a male geek does step forward to protest this behavior on behalf of women, he's told to shut up.

true,rocket_jump_waltz,eccleston,Eccleston,"Some people don't like Moffat, just like some people didn't like RTD. Personally, I think he was much better writing individual episodes as opposed to an entire story arc. He goes over the top hammering details into our heads--compare how ""Bad Wolf"" was pretty underplayed for the first half of Series 1 to how most Series 5 episodes end with a zoom in on a crack in the wall. Yes, we understand it's important; in a show with an overarching plot it's not necessary to constantly beat plot points over our heads. It can be done with subtlety. He comes up with these grand plots that--like RTD--he has trouble resolving. In my opinion (which I don't think everyone needs to share), it was more fun to watch RTD write himself out of a corner than to watch Moffat do the same. With RTD we get ridiculousness, with Moffat we get more questions and a sense that we're supposed to think that the small resolution is much more brilliant than it actually is (I'm looking at you, ""The Wedding of River Song"").

I also have trouble with how he handles characterization, especially that of women. He can't seem to write a strong female character without them being a wife, a mother, or focusing on their relationship with a man. To name a few: How does the Empty Child problem get solved? With Nancy admitting she's a mom. River Song? Her entire life revolved around the Doctor--he's the reason she was born, he's the reason she was kidnapped, she was raised to murder him, he's the reason she became an archaeologist, he's the reason she almost destroys all of time, et cetera. Amy takes revenge on Madame Kovarian because she took her daughter away. Madge can absorb the forest because she's a mother. And then he goes and writes someone like Madame Vastra, who only shows up as a minor character in a single episode. So there are some exceptions to the rule, but they're few and far between.

I don't think that we can use the excuse that he's building up an entire story arc so we should forgive all of his shortcomings. While he may be doing that, there's really nothing to show for it at this point. Even if he turns out something amazing three years down the line, that's not going to change the fact that many people didn't like the route the story took to get there.

I'm not saying that Moffat is the worst thing to happen to Doctor Who or that RTD was a better showrunner. Episodes in RTD's run could be completely over the top and ridiculous. Episodes in Moffat's run can also be over the top and ridiculous, but in a very different way. People are free to like what they like and dislike what they dislike.

First of all, don't speak to HMRC about this.The overwhelming likelihood is that you will never be investigated and the problem will eventually go away. 

If you absolutely have to speak to them about recent matters do not talk not about the time period in question. If they ask about it directly tell them you need to consult your accountant. Either way you are much better off having an accountant file everything for you for a few more years. I've been self-employed since forever and never spend more than £300-£400 a year on accountants. 

Secondly, Could you be considered high risk and therefore are you more likely to be investigated? A tradesman with a history of taking cash, being late with VAT payments or returns....? If so make efforts to make amends now. If they investigate and it's clear you've been naughty they may well give you the 'option' of paying the arrears plus a penalty of something like 30% near enough on the spot, or else they'll [taunt you a second time.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=A8yjNbcKkNY#t=112s) 

If you do decide to tidy things up, get your accountant to do this for you. Yes HMRC absolutely will allow you to pay over a period of time, but probably only if you get in touch with them first and offer to make amends before they come after you. 

Also, you might want have a look at Insolvency Voluntary Arrangements. You can plead poverty and offer to pay them something ridiculous like 20p a week for the next 500 squillion trillion years and it's not considered good form for them to refuse. The corollary is this will also have an impact on mortgage applications and the like.

Good luck.

I'm actually a huge advocate of personal responsibility when it comes to one's online information and frequently try to educate people on privacy issues.

However, to state that things like pedophilia, hebephilia and ephebophilia are normal anywhere is just plain erroneous. These are abnormal, unhealthy, sometimes violent behaviors that are clinically (sometimes grossly) abhorrent. We can say they may be at times *common* on the internet, but to say it is *normal* is false.

The distinction isn't simply semantics (or pedantic) because as I said, whenever someone is smacked down for calling out pervs and creepers this communicates to the offender (the mentally unwell person with a clear lack of social boundaries) that their behavior is indeed normal, or acceptable. And that perpetuates the problem. 

To reiterate my previous point, I'm not arguing the prominence of creepers on the internet; I'm addressing the habit of dismissing or putting the blame on those who speak up against it (as the OP did).

true,animorph,null,null,"&gt;how most Series 5 episodes end with a zoom in on a crack in the wall. Yes, we understand it's important; in a show with an overarching plot it's not necessary to constantly beat plot points over our heads. It can be done with subtlety.

But the crack wasn't meant to be subtle. I think this is why I get frustrated with people trying to compare Bad Wolf and the Crack. One was more akin to an Easter Egg phrase (that actually meant nothing other than a circular paradox), the other was evidence that the universe was cracking - the main plot was *why* the universe was broken.

I mostly agree with you, though, and I find it frustrating that Moffat's most inspired piece of writing for that story arch was that one scene in 'Flesh and Stone' when Time Unravelling Doctor talks to Amy in the forest. 

&gt;I don't think that we can use the excuse that he's building up an entire story arc so we should forgive all of his shortcomings. While he may be doing that, there's really nothing to show for it at this point.

I think it's a poor excuse when you can clearly see the plotholes in his writing.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"&gt;I had worked 5 jobs before the time I was 20 and learned shit loads about life and work and getting on with people. Punctuality was drilled into me early on as was dress code and attitude. Learning to keep your mouth shut was another important lesson as was knowing how to be appreciated.

From this it seems that you learned by doing stuff, same as I did. 

I finished school in the mid 70s and went on to university, and learned a lot from summer jobs. My school helped me get reasonable exam results but didn't teach me anything about work, either as an employee or an entrepreneur. Honestly me-in-2012 wouldn't employ me-in-1976 even to deliver newspapers.

It seems all different now. The primary school my youngest kid goes to carefully tracks everyone and will intervene energetically if any of the pupils falls back in literacy or numeracy. The secondary school my eldest goes to will dish out a detention if someone is wearing the wrong socks, and gets pupils to start a business.

It all seems very different from my school days when we were all complete tossers. The kids all seem so smartly turned out and so well presented. 

On the other hand I get to see a lot of CVs at the moment, for supposedly professional applicants, and I'm gobsmacked at the number of typos and generally sloppy English from native English speakers in a document they have presumably spent  a lot of time and effort on. I suppose it's self selecting: the really good people are rarely looking for work.

true,scmash,null,null,"I think most of the people who insult Supermarket workers have never actually worked in a Supermarket themselves.

Let me say that it is the most mind-numbing, thankless, stressful and god-awful work you can get.

We just got a 10 minute video to remind every 'colleague' to say 'Thank You' to people. The entire attitude is condescending. Head office have one idea of how a shop should 'ideally' work, but if any of our managers stuck to this policy, availability would fall dramatically, then they would lose their jobs.

Basically training in a Supermarket boils down to this. 

* One hour training plus one hour supervision for checkout operators.
* Occasional re briefs on age checking yearly. Fireworks, alcohol and age restricted media. (2 minutes and sign a piece of paper.)
* A 20 minute legal training session yearly.
* A 30 minute year beginning meeting and a 30 minute seasonal meeting yearly.
* And any 1-to-1 deemed necessary for new processes.


Basically, any time you get someone who seems like he actually knows what he/she is doing in a supermarket, or gives you good advice on products/services, chances are they actually know about them themselves. There is absolutely no training on product lines or the products that we sell. Also none of the staff receive commission, and a yearly £200ish bonus MAX.

And when we say ""I own one of those myself!"" we mean it. Not like Comet. :D

I give you an example, only three or four people in my whole store know what an XBox 360 should look like, and what it should have with it when it is returned faulty. Same deal with laptops or TVs. The reason that our return policy is so liberal is not that we offer good customer service, but because it would cost too much to train staff to understand the products we sell.",0,1330219579,null,0,true,0,c3v0z4z,t3_q3vpz,t1_c3v0z4z,t3_q3vpz,null,1428420771,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Uh, what? The OP hasn't said anything. The person who is screeching and gnashing their teeth isn't the OP. The person I am talking to is someone who thinks no one should be held responsible for putting pictures up on the internet and getting the expected answer from a normally occurring and guaranteed part of the internet.

Not once have I condoned the actions of a pervert. That is character assassination and a flat out lie, one that exposes irrationality and a weakness in your argument. Not everyone is a pervert or pro-pervert, not even those people who disagree with you. You need to calm down, too, just like the other person I was talking to. 

I am a bystander in this. I am simply pointing out that there is a huge lack of self-awareness and responsibility in posting pictures of underage family members online. I wish there was a rule to stop posting teen girls both ways, both by perverts and by family members, especially if that person in the picture is not 18 and thus unable to render consent. That would solve the issue. 

Until then, the choices are: Expect perverts to disappear from the face of the planet (will never happen), waste time admonishing invisible and faceless perverts who don't care that you don't like it (they probably love the attention, or downloaded the picture and are jacking off to it without ever seeing your protest), or simply stop posting bait for them online... I feel if someone really cares about their family and doesn't want them to be oggled, they'd keep them the fuck away from the internet. What do they stand to gain by posting them here? Karma? Is that worth the risk of having their image forever downloaded into a spank bank? Where are these people's priorities?

I understand a person who wants to jerk off to something. That's a biological imperative and it sometimes creeps into taboo areas. They're best handled by ignoring them and removing access to kids, especially ones we know. 

What I don't get is the supposedly rational person who willingly sticks their dick in a beehive and complains when they get stung.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Dailymotion is where you can watch them. If you want the condensed method of getting into classic then know that I watched **all** of classic chronologically and it took 6 months at a pretty darn fast pace. And it was awesome. Just saying that because you should at some point go through it all. But anyways, here's how to get into classic: First thing you do? Watch Genesis of the Daleks. then a quick rundown for the best stories of each Doctor:

William Hartnell, first- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore. The Romans. The Tenth Planet (though the last part is reconstruction only).

Patrick Troughton, second - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

Jon Pertwee, third- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

Tom Baker, fourth The most famous run. There are so many fantastic stories. Genesis of the Daleks, one of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic. And Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

Peter Davison, fifth -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special, andCaves of Androzani!* (the last story)

Colin Baker, sixth- His Doctor is unique with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good.

Sylvester McCoy, seventh. Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis. This is the era where they really try some crazy radical stories.

With this in mind, it is absolutely crucial that the 16th century [Tudor conquest of Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tudor_conquest_of_Ireland) and the establishment of the [plantations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantations_of_Ireland) took place after the [Protestant reformation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation_in_England). It was the difference in religious identity that prevented the British settlers and the native Irish from becoming fully integrated. 

For evidence of this, just look at the Tudor experience compared to the 12th century [Norman conquest of Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Conquest_of_Ireland). The fundamental difference is that the Normans, like the native Irish, were Catholic. This is what enabled them to become so well assassimilated into Irish culture. They learned Gaelic, organized themselves in clans in the Gaelic fashion and practiced Gaelic culture. These people, who later became known as the ""Old English"" became so well assassimilated that they were described as ""Níos Gaelaí ná na Gaeil iad féin"" ([""More Irish than the Irish themselves""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_Irish_than_the_Irish_themselves)). 

With the ""New English"" ([the Tudors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tudor_conquest_of_Ireland)) in the 16th century it was a different story. They conquered Ireland just after the Protestant reformation had taken place in England. Now there was a strong religious schism between the settlers and the natives and this prevented the sort of assassimilation that occured between the Normans and the Irish. A strong aspect of Unionism has always been anti-Roman Catholicism. The Protesant settlers viewed Catholicism as an evil political system and thus introduced the [Penal Laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_laws) to break the power of Catholicism in Ireland. These laws denied native Catholics rights of land ownership, freedom of religious worship, political representation, education, etc. and established the [Protestant Ascendancy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Ascendancy) as the ruling elite in Ireland. 

As Marc Mulholland said: 

&gt; Anti-catholicism was historically
central to unionist psychology, in contrast to the avowal, indeed
insistence, of nationalists and republicans that all inhabitants of the
island, Catholic and Protestant, were part of the nation (whether
they wished to be or not). Protestants, however, considered that
catholicism was an autocratic belief system, superstitious and
conspiratorial. It made Catholic Ireland effete and inferior.


Now these penal laws didn't actually break the hold of Catholicism in Ireland, if anything they strengthened the resolve of the Irish to remain Catholic. Catholic masses began to be carried out in secret, in isolated locations around a [""Mass Rock""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_rock). What the laws did achieve however, was to make the life of the average Irish person much more difficult and to further the processes of discrimination, oppression and unequal distribution of land/resources which fuelled the violence and unrest. So, although it is true that the factors which contributed to the ""troubles"" in Northern Ireland were largely economic and political, these grievances had their origin in the religiously-motivated oppression of the native population. 

If the Tudors had remained Catholic, or the natives had quickly converted to Protestantism, its likely there would have been a much higher level of assassimilation between the British settlers and the native Irish, just like there was with the Normans. The Irish wouldn't have had had such a hard time and would probably have been treated reasonably well under the Union. (Think about how Protestant Scotland flourished under the [Act of Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Enlightenment#After_the_Act_of_Union_1707) in 1707 in contrast to how the Catholic Irish were being treated at the same time). Ireland would most likely not be divided into two separate states today and the Northern Ireland ""troubles"" would not have happened.

If you think about how similar the descendents of the settlers and the descendents of the natives are today; in how they look, speak, act, etc. The only thing that kept them separate for the 400 years or so of their co-existence is the religious divide and the institutionalized discrimination which it gave birth to, sowing the seeds of the ""troubles"" much later. The religious divide is what prevented the integration of the settlers and the natives into a single nation. Again, Marc Mulholland put it well: 


&gt; **It was the coincidence of
conquest with religious schism that prevented the emergence of a
nation state uniting all classes.** For the conquered Irish, adherence
to Roman Catholicism provided consolation and hope for profane
benefit should the true religion be restored in Britain.
Protestantism served as a mark of superiority for the conquerors,
both morally justifying their dominance and preventing dispersal of
their privileges.

**Edit**: There has been some confusion in regards to what I'm actually saying here. I am not claiming that religion was what motivated the British to conquer Ireland and I'm not saying that the conflict in NI known as the ""Troubles"" had anything to do with religion. In regards to this latter point, I've made a comment below which I will paste here: 

&gt;  No one was fighting over the theological differences between Protestantism and Catholicism, and it is unlikely that many people during the Troubles (or even today) would have been able to exhaustively list what these differences actually were/are. The factors which instigated the conflict related to political and economic grievances. These grievances in turn however, were the legacy of a time in which religion and religious identity was of much greater importance. It was the religious divide which prevented the settlers and the natives from merging together to form a single nation and which motivated the settler oppression of the native population. By the time of the Troubles, in the late 1960's however, the societal division had come to be expressed in the more modern, secular terms of nationality, with Catholics primarily identifying as ""Irish"" and Protestants as ""British"". However the origins of this divide (and the political/economic discrimination and oppression which it fueled) were rooted in the initial religious schism between the settlers and the natives.

Shipping to the US isn't quite as cheap as I had anticipated. IDK what service would be used but the US Postal service would charge $60 for a large flat rate shipping box, which I estimate would hold at least 10 shirts. Let me do the math on cost/shirt and I'll be back with an edit.

EDIT: We should be able to get shipping down to about $15 if orders are made in groups of 3 and we ship 10 shirts per USPS box:

* $2.10 shipping per shirt from website if order quantity = 3
* $60.95 for 10 shirts in USPS flat rate box to ship to US=&gt; $6.10 per shirt
* $5.95 per shirt/location to ship out ""individually"" if one person orders more than 1 this will be less of course

So now the problem may lie in how to make this happen - how trusting are you of strangers over the internet? We would have to agree on one person to receive shirts in the US and ship them. And we would have to find a way to pay our UK redditor for the shipment as well as the US redditor who distributes.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy (wait til classic) special effects-wise and the writing needs a bit of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

And even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor.

true,Generallysceptical,scot-Aberdeen,"The frozen, godless, north","The nhs pension scheme (it's not a separate scheme for doctors) is an entirely self financing scheme that currently pays a surplus of 2 billion pounds back into the treasury. 

The scheme was renegotiated 4 years ago, with facility to increase contributions if that surplus turns to deficit. There are other public servants who pay half as much for the same pension at equal pay.  Your £100 000 is top end consultant pay. Starting salaries are below £30 000, with current student debt at £37 000 and due to rise to £70 000 with £9000 tuition fees. Naturally, it's still a well paid job but people are naive if they think altruism will sustain the quality of workforce currently in the NHS.  The deal was always that doctors were paid well in maturity, in return for the long slog leading there. Take years of sub-inflation pay rises wiping £10 000 equivalent purchasing power off a doctors wage and a bright, academic, successful teenager who is deciding what to do with their life now knows that choosing medicine means working until 70, for less reward at the end and a quarter of a million pounds less purchasing power (not that pay will be matching inflation any time soon) in their life. How altruistic do you expect people to be? What low or middle income backgrounds will be up for this, when those with the skill set to study medicine are highly sought after and successful in other fields? 

What seems to be less reported is the fact that in an attempt to buy off the most established medics with the most political clout, the government has introduced an extension to the old scheme that will see a third of the most experienced part of the workforce leave on early retirement.

I'd feel the same way too if my coach benched me after giving it my all throughout my career.

Although AVB's first season has been pretty dramatic, I think next season will be better. He has to bring in someone who is noticably better than Lampard for Lampard to be content in being a bench player for the remainder of his career. Hope De Bruyne becomes a top player. Sick of buying hyped up future greats who become nothing.

But the principle should remain - they should be putting back into the community . Personally I would like to see them , after a period of 3 months , put on work such as cleaning up the environment - picking up litter , cleaning up pavements , cleaning off graffiti , tidying verges . Also things like helping elderly people . There is a lot that can be done that is not directly in the commercial world . A lot of it are things that would not normally be funded .

This gives them :-

1) work experience .

2) a sense of responsibility and self worth .

3) a connection into the general community .

I would also be in favour of some form of national service . This having a good number of options including non military . Anyone who wants to claim unemployment benefits would either have had to have done national service or have been paying into the tax system for a minimum of 5 years .

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; There are tonnes of questions that haven't been answered. There are large things we would lose and so far the SNP (The Political Party pushing the idea) have just kind of stuck to the ""We could be like Sweden!"" lines.

No, that's simply not true. The SNP have attempted to answer every one of those questions you have brought up. You can choose whether or not you will believe the answers they give, but to say they have avoided these issues is completely incorrect, and to say they have never ""even been remotely addressed"" is basically burying your head in the sand. 

&gt;What currency do we use? 

The SNP have repeatedly stated that they intend to continue using the pound sterling as the currency in Scotland. It is a freely traded and convertible currency, so no one can stop us using the currency even if we haven't reached an official agreement about the sharing of the central bank.

The SNP have also said that if it makes economic sense into the long term future, we can explore other currency options such as the Euro. The SNP is a very democratic-minded and transparent party and they would probably open a public consultation about people's views on currency reform, such as asking whether businesses or individuals supported creating a Scottish currency.

&gt;Do we get the oil?

If Scotland becomes independent, the Scottish government intends to claim a geographic share of the North Sea territorial waters. From their proposed constitution: 

http://www.constitutionalcommission.org/production/byre/images/assets/file/Resources%20Folder/SNP_2002_text.pdf

&gt;The Territory of Scotland comprises all those areas over which the Court of Session and High Court of Justiciary have exercised jurisdiction since the time of, and in virtue of, the ratification of the Articles of Union of 1707, and all the territorial waters appertaining thereto under international law at the time at which this Constitution comes into force, and the sovereignty of the Scottish state extends over all such rights in relation to exploitation of the resources of the sea, the sea bed and the sub soil thereof beyond the limit of territorial waters as are enjoyed and exercised by states under international law at the time at which this Constitution comes into effect; and for the future, the extent of the territorial waters and of such other rights shall be determined in accordance with the relevant provisions of the law of nations for the time being.

This is completely normal and rational point of view to take. If the UK disputes this, then they are basically behaving the same way the United States does destroying Iraq to control oil in the Middle East, or installing obedient dictators to control resources or economies in Latin America, except without the bloodshed and terror. It would not go down very well, not only in Scotland, but in pretty much the entire world. 

Here are a few more things to read about this:

&gt;What about the Scots in the military? 

Any Commonwealth or Irish citizen can join the UK's armed forces. 

http://www.baff.org.uk/20090102139/foreign-and-commonwealth-citizens-serving-in-uk-armed-forces.html

&gt;Will we join Europe?

The SNP's position is that we are already in the European Union, and that all that needs to be done is is for Brussels to recognise Edinburgh as a new member capital by a majority vote, unlike new member states such as Croatia. Even if this is not possible, the people of Scotland are already European citizens, something that cannot be taken away, and therefore retain all the rights associated with that (freedom of movement, access to education and employment).  

Some consensus is forming that if Scotland succeeds, the EU will treat it as a state dissolution and both the rest of the UK and Scotland will be in the exact same position in terms of continuing their respective EU memberships. 

&gt;EU legal experts say both Scotland and “RUK” – the remainder, of England, Wales and Northern Ireland – would be treated the same by Brussels, with both having to renegotiate continued membership.

&gt;One of those legal figures said such a renegotiation would involve a deal “done by the [European] Council, using qualified majority voting, and with the required say-so of the European Parliament”.

&gt;This would put Scotland in a different category to new member states such as Croatia, which – as an “accession state” – must get unanimous backing of all EU governments before gaining entry, and agree to join the euro.

http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/politics/scotland_and_rest_of_uk_would_have_to_renegotiate_eu_status_1_2116803

This bullshit about being [vetoed out](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/spain-could-wield-veto-over-scotlands-eu-membership-6292846.html) of EU membership by Spain, for example is [nonsense](http://newsnetscotland.com/index.php/scottish-politics/4428-spanish-foreign-minister-confirms-that-spain-would-accept-scottish-independence)

&gt;Will taxes go up?

Depends on who you vote to run the country. The SNP isn't going to be the only political party in an independent Scotland. The SNP's current position seems to be that they want to decrease the corporation tax. If you don't think this is sensible, then you can vote for Labour. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA6TcWmMAjA&amp;t=00m55s

&gt; Will we still get the BBC? 

Yes. The SNP's position is that intends for television providers to purchase BBC programming on the same basis that is available in the Republic of Ireland, while using licence fee income to set up a Scottish public broadcaster.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utVnnggS30E&amp;t=05m06s

http://www.scotlandforward.net/media/scotland-forward.pdf (page 27)

The BBC also isn't exactly doing Scotland many favours. I invite you to read this, from Ofcom:

&gt;BBC Scotland core funding 
equated to only 3.7 % of the BBC’s entire programme making budget. [This] only allows 
BBC Scotland to provide something akin to a skeleton media service for its 
Scottish audience. 

&gt;Scotland has a population equivalent to 
10.5% that of England. One would therefore assume that BBC Radio Scotland 
should be broadcasting approximately 10.5% of the radio hours that the BBC 
English Regions broadcast. Indeed, given Scotland's national status, one would 
think that BBC Scotland would be broadcasting more hours per head than the 
average English Region or County. However, as the tables above and below 
show, BBC Radio in Scotland broadcast only 3.9 % of what is broadcast in 
England. 

http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/consultations/psb/responses/mceihil_annex.pdf

&gt;Will business' stick around?

Well if businesses were seriously concerned about independence, we would be sure to see some kind of reluctance to invest or even devestment right now. Most businesses do not have any official position on independence, mostly saying that they are concerned about the preservation of single markets but that otherwise they are fine, their accouting departments handle differences in jurisdiction, taxation and currency perfectly fine and that shouldn't be a major issue.

&gt;There is a very real chance we would become a pathetic backend nobody with no money or resources. 

Here are some more links to resources on some objective, and one rather biased but still interesting stand on on Scotland's independent economic prospects. The consensus seems to be that independence would really not cause any major benefits or serious risks of becoming a ""pathetic backend"".

And the president called to convey his personal best wishes."" - from the 2005 series episode ""Dalek.""

Or this exchange from ""The Almost People"": 

  The Doctor Ganger: Hello! Adam! I'm the Doctor. Well. Other Doctor... Smith. It's complicated. And boring. Anyway, who cares! It's your birthday!

  Adam: Yay!

  The Doctor Ganger: Yay! Now, have you been getting up very early and jumping on the bed?

  Adam: Yes, really high.

  The Doctor Ganger: I expect chocolate for breakfast. If you don't feel sick by mid-morning you're not doing it right.




  And then there's the episode in the alternate universe where it's Jackie's birthday and she's grousing about her birthday banner showing her real age.

 Or you could adapt a line from one of the songs Murray Gold did. Like from ""Song For Ten"" - ""I hope today is the best day, everything you ever dreamed"" or some such. Or not. That's kind of a mouthful, even for writing, and doesn't immediately suggest birthdays or Doctor Who :P.

&gt; Churches have every right to make rules about who can and cannot get married in church.    
&gt; ...most of this argument would go away if ... if non-church people stopped moaning about what happens in them.

Given that the reasons people don't want gays to get married in church are biblically justified (in the main), can you see that 'the state' being OK with one such instance of discrimination then they should, to be consistent, be OK with any other? Although it was never really the case (officially) in the UK that interracial marriage was opposed by the church (although I don't doubt it happened, I'm unaware of an interracial couple being turned away from a church) it can be justified on theological grounds that such a couple shouldn't get married in a Christian setting. That was certainly the case in the US. A similar example is countless clergy arguing for slavery.

My point is: why is this form of discrimination generally seen as perfectly acceptable, effectively agreeing with some religious people that ""Everyone knows that gays can't be Christian/gays can't have a Christian wedding."", but other types wouldn't even be given a second thought (and rightly so)? Why is the gay question so different?

There are [many clergy](http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/clergy-rebellion-over-gay-church-weddings) and [many Christians](http://richarddawkins.net/articles/644942-rdfrs-uk-ipsos-mori-poll-2-uk-christians-oppose-special-influence-for-religion-in-public-policy) (see 'Relationships') in the UK who would like to see gays getting married in churches (edit - to be clear, the clergy are 'OK' for civil partnerships in church and even though they're making the case that ""It's OK because it's not a marriage as such"", I doubt they'll be able to backtrack on that if gay marriage is legalised), so it's really not a fundamental Christian view that such unions cannot or should not take place. I have no doubt that we could find more than a handful of Christians in this country who don't think a black woman and a white man should marry, and point to the relevant passages in the bible. And yet we don't humour them for a second.

My original comment was on how in theory it was a great scheme, but it has been abused, I suspect more by the government trying to juggle figures than by the companies using the work fare ( or whatever it is called now) scheme. Hence it has all developed into big stink that detracts from the original idea. 

In addition, unless you are extremely lucky, many of the JSA advisors couldn;t give a shit if you find work or not, they are so uninterested in helping you back to work. All they care about is if you have filled the form in properly and if you are looking like you are looking for work, or applying for jobs whether you are suited to them or not. I had to sign on for 6 weeks last Summer, ( temporary just to cover in between degrees/research) and I got lucky with a good advisor, but many don't. Many who sign on feel demoralised after their visit, like they are worthless and no one considers them good enough to get a job. Being out of work is demoralising enough for most people.  How on earth that is suppsed to support peple back into work I have no idea. 
I have also heard reports that some of the schemes run by A4E have been a waste of time, sitting about all day reading the paper because there are not enough computers to go around, and when you do get on a computers, no ne is really interested enough to help with a CV or effective job hunting skills. Hardly the great expectations put up on A4E websites to 'help people back to work'. 
 All I am saying is things are never as they seem, all the ideals of placements and help blah blah don't always  come through, and help the people they are supposed to.

So in some countries, there can arise sometimes a real lack of low denomination coinage.

Correct me if I'm wrong because I most probably am, but why are we sending our youth to lower divisions, or even worse selling them away only to have them come back and bite us in the ass. Scott Sinclair is one player I had hopes for and was gutted when he left.

I don't mind seeing Chelsea linger in 3rd-5th spot for a few seasons if it means that our youth will have more playing time. Majority of the fans basically want it to happen, we all know what's needed. Take a leaf out of Arsenal's book.

But I think it is a symptom of what is going on that the people who really need to learn from work are also the people who put the least effort into it. Punctuality and cleanliness are just 2 of the barest requirements any employer needs yet time and again it seems somehow kids are missing out on this lesson. So who is it who is supposed to be teaching them? Do the first thing they teach on any training course the basics of what it is to actually work in the real world? If not than there lies a fundamental problem in what is being taught by these courses is not what business needs to function. 

It is why as much as I can see the disquiet against any of these private company training schemes I cannot help feel it is missed opportunity. Yes to the uninspired it looks like working for nothing but if a company trains you to do a job for them and you learn how to do that well that is worth MORE than just money because it is totally portable and transferable to any other work. That is part of everyone personal CV and skill set. Kids do understand these concepts because they spend inordinate amounts of time leveling up on WOW and STEAM and the like. Perhaps that is what we should be doing, giving trophies to help them know they are improving?

You don't come across well with this title though. For one, I'm sure there's a few people here who go to pretty much every game. Secondly, the Chelsea fans I meet abroad are cool people and really care a lot about the club. I live in the US and Caribbean as well as the UK and it takes dedication to wake up at 4/5am to catch kickoff, as many of them have to do.

As a word of warning, by saying unofficial I assume you are saying you got the tickets from a third party. Well, this can end pretty badly.

The beginning is probably having a personality that doesn't mind standing out from the crowd, is keen to actively change the world, and is willing to do extra work.

Having that personality, you are probably already involved in groups and committees. Spread your wings a bit -- it is surprising how easy it is to step up a bit, to the next level up in an organisation, from maybe local branch to regional committee or whatever. Gaining experience of formal committee work and ""how things are done"" , and how to present a case and win supporters to it is all useful experience. It is much better to come to politics with a ""cause"", rather than as someone looking for power.

At the same time volunteer for your  chosen political party. (If you really don't feel strongly about one, check out your local independent councillors and volunteer to help one of them.)
If you can afford to work without pay for a couple of months, explore interning for one of the party central offices in London -- very educational in many ways! EDIT: Or look at Brussels -- particularly if you speak another relevant language.

When you have got your feet under the table at the local party office, express your interest in standing for a local council seat. Note that many people have no further political ambition than that, and you may find that actually this is best for you too. Very few people make it to become a Westminster MP or MEP. If you get selected as a candidate, you will be expected to put a great deal of time into the constituency while still working your day job. And it may be several years before you have a realistic chance of winning an election.

Of course you don't have to take all the steps people are posting here, but you do need to take some of them -- people don't emerge from nowhere and win an election. Councillors fit in to the whole scheme by doing a useful job in their local area, as an aim in itself. They may also be learning the ropes for stepping up the scale.

EDIT: Depending on your ambitions, you could also look at changing the world by becoming a civil servant or working for the EU (or your town hall). We need good people there!

true,LonerGothOnline,uk,I'm from the Internet.,"Before you get the JSA, you have to sign a contract. This contract, the Law we all follow and the rules all need to be followed preciesly.

I've got to apply for 6 jobs a week, show evidence of it, give numbers (sometimes an employers personal information), just so that they can find out if I have been applying for 6 different jobs every week. 

There are about 1,400 jobs a day on direct.gov.uk, and millions of unemployed.

If you are unskilled and unable to do the work neccessary, but applied anyway because of your contract and the lack of available positions, you'll be aggravating employers, maybe resulting in them not advertising in the future and you'll give them more paperwork to deal with. Most employers get 100's of applications to run through for one position, (recently I went to apply for a cleaning position and she told me her day is full of interviews!).

What is worse is that currently I get the feeling that companies don't want to pay minimum wage out anymore. (Disguising real work, vital to the continued operation of the company as ""apprenticeships"", just so they get away with paying 4 pounds less an hour!).

The job agencies also want to place you in any available jobs, regardless of hours, pay, your abilities, your skills, your ability to comprehend casual conversation....

I recently went on a work choices course, that gives a certificate at the end to people that pass the course. This course was designed to see if you are human, can work, have skills... yes, a course that proves you are ALIVE exists. (I think it is about general knowledge and common sense, fail the course and your retarded?)

I enjoyed the course, thanks to a charismatic tutor, decent people in the course, and I feel more confidant about getting a job in the future.

The job agencies, the JCP and the newspapers give me a feeling of hostility towards all jobless. This work course was awesome. It was the first thing ever in my 4 months unemployment that treated me like a fucking human!

Also, one girl that signs me on, couldn't care less and one other women, a mother, is nosy, helpful, gives you confidence, advice... my personal advisors are nice people as well, they could tell you stories about other jobseekers that makes you feel like you are a special case of jobless, because you aren't trashing the joint.

Firstly I managed to pick up a lot of part time and summer work, which is probably less available now. (It will certainly be less available if companies are replacing these potions with workfare roles.)  

Secondly back when I graduated local authorities were still hiring, and all the good stuff wasn't outsourced. This gave me the chance to learn some useful skills.

* **Ref was inconsistent.** Dunno what you saw but I saw several tackles from behind made by Arsenal players - and I don't think I saw a single card for it (and we were lucky if we got a free kick out of the tackles). Did you see all those free kicks to Arsenal, for no reason what so ever? That's the reason Ade was laughing his way through the game. Why was Modric booked, BTW? I didn't see anything. And both Parker bookings was things they were doing to us throughout the game. Did you see when Rosinsky or Sagna tried to kick Bale's knee off in the first 20 mins? No card.

* **'Arry made bad substitutions.** As I noted above, to take on Sandro instead of Saha was bad, should have been Parker coming off. Don't get me wrong, Parker had a good game, he was unlucky to be too slow regarding 3-4 of the goals, but with the yellow card he got (for nothing) he should have been coming off. There was a clear change in the attack dog that is Scott Parker from before the first yellow and after the yellow - he was more like a nice poodle that was happy just to tag along for the ride. Now I fear, when he got the second yellow (for nothing again, I think), the loss of him in the upcoming Manchester United game is too heavy for us. And the Rafa sub was also totally inconceivable, I thought Niko was doing a good job. Sure, he wasn't always pushing the sides as he was supposed to, but he acted like a second Parker to help win back the ball deep.

* **We played bad.** I don't think much of this was down to Wenger, or Harry. We were sloppy (as noted above me) and looked really demotivated and hurt by the 2-2 bounce-back ... and we never recovered. Arsenal were the better team in the second half, no doubt about it, but I feel that every goal they did in the second half was just pure luck (Rosinsky, he even missed the ball?), or just bad defending from our side (Walcott).

**The sad conclusion:** The gap is 7 points. We lost Parker for the Manchester United game, which I fear we will lose and then the gap is probably 4 points. And a loss at Chelsea makes it 1 point, and I'm having a hard time seeing how we will be able to hold on to that when there's two teams breathing down our neck.

Was this the game that lost us our 3rd spot? Will we even fall down to 5th? It's a sad day to be thinking ahead.",0,1330271933,null,0,false,0,c3v6fmq,t3_q6q0a,t1_c3v6fmq,t3_q6q0a,null,1428423472,-1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,-1

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"Regardless of the fact that they scored 3/5 goals in the second half, the first half is what did us in.

Playing two up front against Arsenal at the Emirates is tactical suicide. They basically had 5 people playing through the middle and we had at any given time 3 at most to deal with it.

We got two fairly fortunate goals, it galvanized them, and our formation invited pressure onto us. 

They got the two right before the half, and from that point there was only going to be one winner.

Second half the goals come down to individual mistakes rather than problems with the formation. We had more of the ball actually and actually tried to play out, but we played a high line with no pressing so it was inviting King to get caught out for pace.

Ledley to blame for their 3rd goal, and once they were ahead we just stopped defending period. 

It can't always be about ""havin' a go"" as Harry says. The fact that we beat Newcastle with their fucking 3rd string midfield almost scared me because I thought we might come out with the exact same team. Such is Harry's childlike tactical prowess.

We didn't need to park the bus, but we needed to do our best to control the midfield. I truly hope VDV wasn't fit to start the game, because he fucking should have. Not only does he score for fun against this team, he would have been another outlet in midfield and we would have been able to actually get ahold of the ball early on and frustrate them.

Instead we let them play through us and get into a rhythm. Whether it's arrogance or just pure tactical naivete, Harry is to blame for the first half and the momentum it gave them, and our players surely didn't listen to his instructions in the second. Sandro and Parker were flying forward to try to win the ball back instead of just shielding the back four, especially once we went down. That couldn't have been by design.

It was a lucky start, but it also played right into their hands because we were already outnumbered in midfield and then once they had the impetus to attack we dropped off and invited even more pressure.

I thought it was ominous even at 2-0. We allowed them to get into their rhythm by playing with 2 up front and hoofing it to them, we galvanized them by scoring two early goals, and then our players completely lost their discipline in the second half.

I've said it 3-4 times already, but VDV better have been fucking only half fit if he didn't start this game. We needed another body in midfield. It's just not possible to play through a team that consistently outnumbers you 4-2 or 5-3 in the middle of the pitch. 

Whether it's arrogance or just pure stupidity, we played into their hands. Even fucking Wenger didn't look worried at all when they conceded two goals because he knew they were creating chances at will.

But I do think that Lampard can play consistently well enough to expect to play week in week out. If he's not, then he's not playing well enough as he should.

&gt;So now, we have millions of kids spilling out of school looking for their first job. Realistically, they know those jobs are going to be dire and drudgerous for the first few years, but at least they pay.

&gt;Confront these kids with bullshit like Workfare instead of a respectable start to an actual career, and they’re going to instantly clock that the British workplace is an exploitative scam designed explicitly to immiserate them for the benefit of others.

http://liberalconspiracy.org/2012/02/26/workfare-it-works-if-you-want-to-drive-more-people-to-crime/

and also this from a different end of the political spectrum:

&gt;Actually, if working in a supermarket is your thing, then the experience may well be useful –  however, while working there, the job seeker should be paid the going rate. Anything less is exploitation. And, if you really do want to work in a supermarket, you can safely ignore his wittering about career opportunities and learning about the wider business. Sure, you might, but likely as not, you won’t. Likely as not, you will get a brief induction, some simple stuff about health and safety and you are out in the aisles with a mentor for a shift while you stack shelves. After that, you will probably be flying solo. Unlike Grayling, I reside in the real world. Given that you normally pay a college to train you, demonstrates Graylings disingenuousness when attempting to compare the two things, frankly.

&gt;The academies go from 25% in 2008 to 43% in 2011 on 5 GCSEs EM, but fall back to 29% without equivalents. The non academies go from 28% to 45%, and fall back to 34% without equivalents.

&gt;Exactly the same pattern – academies closed the gap a little, by 1%, on raw %5 GCSEs EM, but the gap increased in favour of the non-academies when equivalents are taken out.

This means that the womenfolk can walk around without the black bin bags or ""abaya"" that all females are forced to wear in KSA (Kingdom of...), and they can chat with whoever they like without risking being beaten and thrown in jail. Compounds also provide protection from the sexual harassment which females are subjected to outside the gates from ALL males, not just the nut-jobs.

The protection is also supposed to prevent attacks from Bin Laden's followers, who have been known to kidnap westerners, but didn't stop audacious assaults like [the ones in 2003](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh_compound_bombings) in which 35 were killed and 160 injured.

Compounds mostly have their own facilities, shops, restaurants, gym, and communal areas with pools and other leisure facilities. Normally, one of the residents will be designated to manage the hooch production for the compound, smuggling in or sourcing whatever is not available here, and brewing or fermenting the goods.

These compounds are very expensive to live on, costing up to £50K a year for a family villa, which is why most are not rented privately, but by employers.

I would need to see a transcript of the court proceedings so that I could review the evidence before I could make an informed decision.

Based on the little information in the articles I am in agreement with the judge's decision. Here are the facts as far as I can tell:

* The age of consent in the UK is 16

* The law states that no person under the age of 14 is capable of giving consent and that anyone who has sex with a child of the age is committing statutory rape, regardless of whether the child is willing.

* Consensual sex with somebody between the ages of 14 and 16 is illegal but not considered rape. 

* The men (they claim) believed the girl was at least 14 and had given consent. They did not knowingly commit rape. 

Based on this I believe, as the judge did, that it would be unjust to apply the maximum sentence given the circumstances of the case. The real punishment is being put on the sex offenders register for life anyway.

So you expect anyone to be in a position to educate anyone about anything ? And you expect yourself to be in a position to educate me about gypsies ?

&gt; Did I say that?

Didnt you ?

&gt; Would you like to do some research of your own instead of using ignorance as a shield?

Would you stop wrongly inferring that i made no research on the subject ?

&gt; Not what I said.

So what did you say ?

&gt; You think this is a debate?

Do you think that the name of this attempt to prove your point should bear another name ?

&gt; Several times.

Would you mind pointing out where i did ?

&gt; You haven't been reading.

So you would label ""listening to the common opinion"" as doing research ? And then in the same time think that i am not able to do so ?

&gt; I don't have to.

So you admit to not having done those ?

&gt; Why haven't you?

Did i make any claim ? If i didnt how could i have to back them ? A claim would have to be defined and existing to be able to be backed, do you see the lack of logic in your reasoning ?

&gt; Why do you think the majority of my comments in this thread have gotten upvotes?

Why do you think that having upvotes carry any weight ? Do you still think that the majority opinion carry any value ?

&gt; If I were that ignorant on a subject

So if you were to have done research, wouldnt you provide the result of those researches ?

&gt; you, for instance, haven't even seen the show as evidenced by your questions

Would you point me to the place where i expressed any view about the show ?

&gt; Not true. I didn't say 'Expert in Armchair' as you suggested.

Well you had not defined it, did you ?  How would you have expected me to differentiate both type of experts ?

&gt; Armchair experts = people with no prior knowledge or experience that assume that if it isn't on the internet, it isn't true or doesn't exist

So you dont think that they might be people more qualified than you to give an opinion on a subject without them having been reading the sun ?

&gt; Can you find a study that proves this isn't so?

Why would you ask me to back a claim I never made ? And what about this bear in the box underground ? Would you mind proving that it does not exist ?

I'm sure many of you know, but it's hard looking like a man with tear in your eyes at the pub. I'm proud to say that even in the worst moments of this game, Liverpool still had the support of millions of fans. Personal friendships were made in Chicago, today; I can tell you that much. 

It's been a long road, and one that has not come easy, but in the end, we've been the better side, and helped King Kenny become the third manager to have helped lifted all three domestic cup trophies. 

Cheers to all the Red men, and to all the fans.

true,CousteauWarrior,null,null,"There are a number of reasons as to why this could be plausible, I'll just give you what I find are the most evident:

1) We know from the End of Time that there needs to be some kind of pre-existing connection in order for the Time Lords (in the Time Lock) to connect with the ""outside"" world - in our case, Earth. In the Master's case, this was the drum beat that they planted. With that being said, there must therefore be some kind of connection between Wilfred and the unknown Time Lady (presumed to be the Doctor's Mother), as she is able to connect with him, seemingly whenever she wants to.

2) The Doctor and Wilfred run into each other on a regular basis, after his first appearance in the Titanic episode. This implies some kind of important relationship the two have. At first it was thought that the connection was between the Doctor and Donna, which got kind of a brush off answer of ""fate"" - instead, perhaps there is some kind of connection between them *as a result of his connection with Wilfred, her grandfather*

3) It's hinted at numerous times in the last two episodes of Tennant's run that this is a possibility - Wilfred and The Doctor both saying they ""...would be proud to have him as his father/son.""

4) Wilfred's actions mirror those of the Doctor and of the Time Lords - even when he was fighting in the war, he never killed anyone. He also couldn't kill the Master when he was given the chance

We have seen that Time Lords can hide as humans, so perhaps it is possible that Wilfred is the Doctor's Father - who somehow escaped the Time War. I know that this is a lot of conjecture, and maybe it's a bit *too* cheesy, but the idea is still great. It's probably quite unlikely that this is the case but I love Wilfred too much to believe that his role doesn't have more importance.

How many millions of unemployed people are there who are claiming benefits and have no intention of working?  Do you have sources for the figure?

How many of them have never paid into the national insurance 'pot'?  If they've never paid in, then that assumes they've never worked.  How many of them have never worked?  Do you have a figure or a percentage?  Also, a source, of course.

The most important thing about your post is that I think you're fundamentally misunderstanding the point of JSA.  It's in place so that people who don't currently have a job are financially supported whilst they look for employment.  It's not a salary, it's something that we, as a civilised country, give to people who are less fortunate, to prevent them from being thrown out of their houses and living on the street.

I value the fact that we help people that are in trouble.  This is, I think, what makes us considerate, caring human beings.

Suggesting that someone should work for far less than minimum wage is not the mark of a considerate, caring human being.

No offence intended, but I find it very difficult to understand someone like you who is seemingly devoid of empathy.

true,Feint1,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"&gt;How many millions of unemployed people are there who are claiming benefits and have no intention of working? Do you have sources for the figure?

It may not be millions of people, but it's definitely no small number.

&gt;How many of them have never paid into the national insurance 'pot'?

Most of the recent graduates and school leavers have never paid national insurance.

&gt;The most important thing about your post is that I think you're fundamentally misunderstanding the point of JSA. It's in place so that people who don't currently have a job are financially supported whilst they look for employment. It's not a salary, it's something that we, as a civilised country, give to people who are less fortunate, to prevent them from being thrown out of their houses and living on the street.
&gt;I value the fact that we help people that are in trouble. This is, I think, what makes us considerate, caring human beings.

Good, I don't want to see hard working people on the street either.

I, like the majority of people, believe that money comes from hard work. The government should ensure that you have enough to live on, but it shouldn't be given for nothing. You should contribute something back to society in return for this money.

&gt;No offence intended, but I find it very difficult to understand someone like you who is seemingly devoid of empathy.

You want to take money from hard working people, who struggle to get by, so that you can give the money to some kid who isn't working. Yet you think you're a more compassionate person?

Giving away money for absolutely nothing incentives laziness. You are allowing people to live without working.

&gt;Where does this end? Does everyone in receipt of benefit have to 'earn' it? 

&gt;Disability benefit? 

Depends, fat people should definitely not get this. But generally those who need help should get help. It just shouldn't go to those who are not really disabled.

&gt;Child benefit? 

Children aren't the same as adults.

I'm not sure how £67 a week incentivises laziness.  If I was receiving that much, I'd be running to the job centre.

&gt;You should contribute something back to society in return for this money.

Guess what?  If we paid people to do a job that clearly exists rather than making them 'earn' their benefits by doing that self same job, they'd be paying taxes.  Those taxes would then benefit society.  See how it works?  It's all quite clever, really.

&gt;Children aren't the same as adults.
Thanks for that.  I think you'll find that child benefit is not paid directly to the children themselves, but to their parents so it counts as a benefit to adults which I kind of the point I was making.  I'm surprised you're not trying to stop people getting child benefit, actually.

Your posts have had the same level of figures to back them up. I don't know why you assume I have a database of information for every topic. If you care so much about actually numbers you should do a survey.

&gt;I'm not sure how £67 a week incentivises laziness. If I was receiving that much, I'd be running to the job centre.

If you were given a job scrubbing public sector toilets for £67 you would be running faster.

&gt;If we paid people to do a job that clearly exists rather than making them 'earn' their benefits by doing that self same job, they'd be paying taxes. Those taxes would then benefit society. 

It's not an ideal situation at the moment. But getting people to work in the public sector for very little money benefits society more than paying someone a decent wage. You see, the less it costs us the better.

&gt;Thanks for that. I think you'll find that child benefit is not paid directly to the children themselves, but to their parents so it counts as a benefit to adults which I kind of the point I was making.

The cost of a child is quite high, so incentivising children is not a bad thing. Obviously some reforms do need to be made to make the system fairer on those who actually work.

&gt;I'm surprised you're not trying to stop people getting child benefit, actually. After all, if they've chosen to have a child, why should you and other hard working people be paying towards somebody's elses kid getting an xbox Kinect for Christmas, am I right?

Nice logical fallacy.

&gt;Anyway, I don't think I'll bother typing any more because you've already spectacularly failed to engage with most of the points I've raised, so this would seem to be a waste of time.

I won't be agreeing with you any time soon, maybe it is a waste of time.

&gt;You've clearly made your mind up based on bias alone.

I don't see any bias in my arguments. You however do seem to have a very strong bias in favour of JSA claimants.

&gt;I'm reminded of Harlan Ellison: You are not entitled to your opinion. You are entitled to your informed opinion. No one is entitled to be ignorant.

You sound like someone who reads the Guardian, you probably think anyone who doesn't agree with you must be ignorant or ill-informed.",0,1330295839,null,0,false,0,c3va79e,t3_q5h9b,t1_c3va79e,t1_c3v9m6z,null,1428425240,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I can understand the frustration of long-time users who have seen the same stuff posted around month after month. But I think there are a few important factors to keep in mind: 

**1) sites like Reddit (and forums) are a do-acracy.** If people want to see a different type of discussion then they need to lead by example by actively *posting* those kinds of topics. In addition, individuals need to support  such posts by actively *upvoting* to encourage different discussion.

**2) Subreddits (like forums) have an ebb and flow, following topical trends.** As you've already noticed there's a difference in content during the off-season. This is just part of the pattern of the internet and things will come back around during the on-season.

**3) Fan sites (like this subred) are specifically for sharing how the show has affected you personally.** This includes fan-made images, crafts, clothing, food, etc. as much as it does personal critique and analysis of characters and episodes. Not every post is going to be in-depth and intellectual, and that's ok. Sometimes it's nice to just pop in for a few minutes, see some funny or poignant images, and get back to work.

&gt; ...it was not until the end of the 18th century that nationalism began to be a generally recognized sentiment molding public and private life and one of the great, if not the greatest, single determining factors of modern history. Because of its dynamic vitality and its all-pervading character, nationalism is often thought to be very old; sometimes it is mistakenly regarded as a permanent factor in political behaviour. Actually, the American and French revolutions may be regarded as its first powerful manifestations.

It also touches some on the sources which people drew their sense of identity from before the rise of nationalism.
