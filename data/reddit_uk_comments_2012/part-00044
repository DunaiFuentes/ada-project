true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"Reddit's algorithm does not kick in until a post gets a large amount of upvotes. Whether it is a link post, self post or comment. The system only kicks in when a post reaches the 500 to 1000 upvotes mark and then it starts fuzzing.

On smaller subreddits though. Posts can easily get 100 upvotes and 0 downvotes because Reddit's system does not kick in. My post yesterday had a 70-0 vote. 

Likewise comments do not get down votes until they reach front page credential. Like the comments on the front page have thousands of down votes but still 1500 as score per comment, that is vote fuzzing. On smaller subreddits it rarely ever kicks in. 

My comments on /r/formula1 (if they get to top) have a 50-0 or 60-1/2 score normally. So either everyone agrees or maybe 1 or 2 people comment below to disagree and down vote. The Reddit vote fuzzing **never** kicks in the way the OP is talking about. That is the downvoting by the neutrals who are participating in the match chat or just reading it. 

If I post ""Wow what a goal from Frank Lampard"" it still gets downvoted. If I post a chant or a cheer it still gets downvoted. Even if it is our match with a smaller team which only has 2 or 3 members on reddit. It is /r/soccer down voting and not reddit vote fuzzing.

/r/soccer admins and many other people use vote fuzzing as an excuse. As someone who knows how vote fuzzing works I've called them out before and when they realized this guy knew what he was talking about they changed their story. 

My posts were getting stuck in the spam filter, legit posts. I kept messaging and they never replied while they kept sharing /r/soccer links over /r/chelseafc and talking about how they are waiting for people to send them suggestions. My posts were resubmitted by mods and other members and made the front page regularly. I finally blew up on the mods and told them to click ""not spam"" on my post. Instead of doing that an admin clicked downvote on it and blamed the vote fuzzing. That when I realized how immature the /r/soccer mods are. In my discussion, I knew more about moderating a subreddit than all of them combined. You will laugh if I release the screenshots of our conversation and how they just lie repeatedly. Thats when I realized why /r/soccer is such a shit hole and why so much crap is allowed to exist on that subreddit. The admins are worse than most posters. I'm sure one of them will come here defending the subreddit now because thats the only thing they spend their time doing.

**So again, this is not vote fuzzing. This is /r/soccer exploiting the down vote system to circle jerk hatred and keeping the relevant comments down.** Go to our match chats, Arsenal fans still get top comments on our match chats. I mean what the fuck?. They actually say nothing intelligent and just an idiotic pun.

EDIT: Read this thread to see the bias:

Here are my reasons:

1. It does use the appropriate typeface (Gill Sans) for the ""POLICE BOX PUBLIC CALL"" sign, but the spacing and positioning relative to borders seems to be off compared to other images.

2. The light doesn't look quite right for the current TARDIS. Tennant's did have a metal cage around it, but Smith's just has maybe four spokes running vertically. This one appears to have a cage (though I could be mistaken due to image clarity when trying to look at such fine details). It also seems to be slightly too tall.

3. The windows don't seem to have the two-tone (or frosted/unfrosted) thing going on.

4. They'd never leave such a vital prop alone and unattended *and* let the public that close to it.  (Those ANDs probably could be replaced by ORs.)

Because (apart from what they call their ""national service"") you have to live on a street where they have deployed their network. The cable companies that make up Virgin all went bust because the costs of deploying these networks outweighed the eventual return.

So Virgin doesn't really plan to expand its footprint outside where it already is. The most they'll do is consider doing some work to connect you up if you live literally a street or two away from their existing network. 

It's probably a good thing, anyway. Virgin's network is not that great.

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"Let me first say that I'm not claiming players are one-dimensional and can only play one of the two roles. There are many players who are versatile enough to do well in both, including most of your list. Just because the same players could fulfil the roles doesn't make those roles the same though.

A winger typically plays with two forwards inside him and another wiinger across the pitch; this means there is far less space inside and his area of attack is far more restricted. He only has two midfielders behind him, so the middle of the forward part of the pitch offers far less space for him to play in. He gets his action by holding the wide area.

A wide forward is typically one of the players on the outside of a forward three. He generally has three players in midfield behind him and another two forwards. He is therefore able to come inside and find space more easily, as the centre is less cluttered. It is not as important for him to use the widest reaches of the pitch because there are narrower opprtunities for him to take advantage of.

The majority of your list play far better in this wide forward role, with more space inside. This is true across football - there are very few players around at the moment who are better wingers than wide forwards, it's just not a fashionable position at the moment (unless you look outside the top tier - there are far more wingers in the Championship than in the PL).

So there are very few players who are actually better wingers than wide forwards at the moment, and I would argue the group of players capable of performing as a winger at a better level than Lennon isn't that big. It's a role that requires pace, the ability to beat a man, the composure to deliver a ball and most importantly the discipline to stay on the fringes of the game for periods. Too many players are awful at this last part and will come inside in search of the ball, and you can't do that too much if you're going to be an effective winger - you need to stay wide and keep the play stretched or no one will be able to do anything in the centre. 

From your list, I'd say only Bale, Valencia and Krasic stand out as being better in a winger role than in a wide foward role (and Krasic isn't as good as Lennon anyway). Of the rest, only Ronaldo, Robben, Nani, Di Maria and probably Hazard would be better in an out and out isolated wing role than Lennon. Messi should probably be on that list too as he's just amazing wherever you put him, and I'd think about including Błaszczykowski as well.",0,1334645569,null,0,false,0,c4d7t3n,t3_sc9eo,t1_c4d7t3n,t1_c4cxeg8,null,1428737802,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,Alex1609,null,null,"&gt;A winger typically plays with two forwards inside him

No part of the definition of winger is that they typically play with two forwards inside them.

&gt;A wide forward is typically one of the players on the outside of a forward three.

That's a winger, wiki definition: ""In football, a winger is an attacking midfielder in a wide position. Wingers are usually players of great pace or dribbling ability so as to provide cut-backs or crosses from which strikers can score. Their main function is to support attack from the wings. Wingers do lots of high-speed running from defense to attack.""

I don't think there is any difference between a winger and a wide forward at all, I think teams have different players with different roles on the wing depending on their personal gamestyle/team tactic, but I'm sure there is no actual distinction between a winger and a wide forward (I'm not even sure a wide forward exists as a position as I've never heard of it before). 

A winger can either be used to cut inside: Robben, Ronaldo, Arshavin. To stay out wide:  Walcott, Bale, Di Maria, Valencia. To play the role of a drifting trequartista: Messi, Hazard, Gotze, Silva. I really can't see how you can classify some as wide forwards and other as wingers based on what you've told me.

It's developed into an even more attacking role in modern football, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth distinguishing it from the different role a wide forward plays in closely supporting a single striker.

Whatever you want to call the roles, clearly what I've described are two different things that require two similar but different sets of skills. If you can't see that the style and formation we play asks a different job of Lennon than the style and formation Arsenal play asks of Walcott I don't know what to say to you.

Surely it's worth making a distinction between such varying functions on the pitch? Or do you also see no value in making distinctions elsewhere? Are you happy just to call Modric and Parker CMs when they clearer have wildly different areas of responsibility and influence? Are you happy to just describe VdV and Adebayor as forwards when they clearly offer vastly different things to the team?

It's not about there being some official dictionary defining these terms that we can all refer to, nice as that might be. It doesn't really matter if you want to refer to those we're talking about as wide forwards and wingers or just different types of wingers as you please. I use wingers and wide forwards because that's become the common parlance with the rise of the 433 in England in the last decade. It's seems a more useful way of describing what's going on.

So, in terms of performance and stability, I have nothing to complain about - in fact I've been pleasantly surprised and very happy that I haven't had to contact BT with any problems.

The weakest link with Inifinty is definitely the home hub. The firmware has limited functionality (no ACL, no VPN support, limited port forwarding abilities etc.), and I was never able to get my wife's Ubuntu powered Toshiba laptop working properly with the WiFi (the laptop had no problems connecting to my old Sky router), so she's now back on Windows. You can buy other wireless hubs for not a lot of money if you need some extra features or better WiFi performance. The Home Hub is obviously aimed at the mass market, so it's simple to use and covers the most basic requirements only.

Overall I'm happy enough that I just started another contract to get the higher speed option. BT are suggesting I'll get 65Mb down and 20Mb up (London, SE18), but have offered no clues as to when the upgrade will happen.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"I don't really understand why the focus is on earthquakes. Tremors at 2 on the Richter scale are absurdly weak, less than the vibrations caused by passing vehicles, and no-one seems to think there's any risk of fracking triggering serious earthquakes. Moreover, there are all sorts of human actions that can [induce seismic activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_seismicity), including the creation of reservoirs, the use of geothermal electricity, and mining. 

In my opinion the risk is entirely the contamination of groundwater, which is a question of whether the operation is run properly: for instance whether the concrete casing on the well is well-made, and appropriately tested, and whether waste water is safely stored before being safely disposed of. I wonder actually whether it might be in the industry's interests to focus attention on easily refutable claims about seismic activity, and away from the introduction of proper regulation of drilling sites, which would inevitably raise their operating costs.

true,jambox888,eng-hampshire,Hampshire whut?,"&gt; Every culture falls under the definition you make, even ancient cultures such as the Chinese and Japanese.

Yes; because that's how culture works. China is quite interesting because it's a large area hemmed in by sea, desert and mountains. Although there were still many cultures in that large area probably by 1000BC, they seem to have largely coalesced into something like the Chinese culture we know by about 1000 years later. I was talking to someone on r/askhistorians and they showed me the [Sanxingdui statues](http://www.cultural-china.com/chinaWH/images/exbig_images/293f328d0b4ff59c5d2440037260c8a9.jpg) which are mysterious but show a separate culture around 1000BC and earlier which was subsumed, so it's a demonstration of your ancient culture ideas, however it also shows that those ancient cultures might be *very* different from what you expect.

Japan is interesting also; despite being a large island like Britain, I believe it has always been much more homegenous, even today. A lack of immigration in modern times has led to a really serious demographic cliff - they are talking about allowing imigration of a million or so migrant workers, I believe. In fact, this is a really important point about immigration that politicans hate to talk about; they tolerate it while talking tough because it keeps domestic demand up and provides additional revenues in the face of an ageing population. Not to mention filling unpoplar jobs like nursing.

And I don't mean all of our culture is a sham or that all of our pride is false. British culture has achieved a huge amount! But a lot of it was through conquest and colonisation and that can't continue, so there's no point hankering after the days of yore.

The only possible source of contaminating water would come from misuse of the fracking solution itself (of which over 95% is just water) after use, as it needs to be properly processed.

My point was that I found your distinction between a wide-forward and a winger vague and unsatisfactory, I believe the two positions you specified are one and the same. A winger is the general term for a wide player, but underneath that term you can further refine the player's role. 

I understand the diversity that different positions encapsulate, accordingly I would actually lump Parker and Modric under the same CM definition umbrella, but obviously considering their vastly different playstyles they play different roles for their club. 

For example: Robben, Ronaldo, Pedro, Ribery, Walcott, Bale are all wingers. 

They can then be broken down further to give more specificity to their role: 

Bale and Walcott are touchline-hugging Wingers,
Ronaldo and Robben are Inside Forwards,
Messi is a Wide Trequartista,
Ribery is a hybrid of an Inside Forward/Traditional Winger.

Similarly take RVP, Rooney, Villa, Adebayor, Pato, Crouch and Defoe, who I would describe as strikers.

Pato is a Centre-Forward,
Crouch and Adebayor are target men,
Rooney and Villa are deep-lying forwards,
RVP is a 9/10 hybrid (bad example as his role is pretty hard to describe),
Defoe is a poacher.

They can all be described under wider-term striker for me though, much like those players earlier can all be described as wingers.

In fact, she told me that when she took our (2 year old) son back to Japan for a holiday, old people would often push her out of the way to get into a lift first because, in Japan, seniority come first.  She loves the culture of men and women putting kids and mothers first in the UK and was amazed when, struggling through snow with our newborn in a buggy, a group of what many would, probably unfairly, call chavs, crossed the street and carried the buggy over the snow for her.

And I suppose that's my point; I didn't feel I had a strong culture until I met my wife and I was living away from home for so long.  But to come back and be re-immersed in it is a wonderful thing, and it made it very apparent to me.  I'm always amazed at people like the EDL saying things are going to pot.

From [the BBC article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17448428)

&gt; We spoke to Mike Hill, a technical advisor to Lancashire's Fylde Borough Council, and a former oil and gas man.

&gt; He is not against fracking, saying that he thinks it is a good idea to make the most we can of this potential new source of energy, but he wants to ensure it is done properly.

&gt; ...

&gt; He wants the state of the wells checked, but is anxious that the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), responsible for worker safety and well integrity, has too few staff and resources to regulate this new industry.

&gt; Mr Hill says he feels they are relying too heavily on paper checks, rather than truly independent, physical testing:

&gt; ""When I asked them: 'OK, how many times have you come down? How many times have you inspected?', they said: 'Cuadrilla say they're doing X, Y and Z.'

&gt; ""'How many times have you actually checked they are doing X, Y and Z?' And the answer? 'None.'

&gt; ""Not once in two years has the HSE visited any of the wells in Lancashire to test, inspect or verify for themselves."" 

Edit: Also, there are plenty of 5% solutions which could 'melt your hand off', and plenty of very highly dilute solutions which could cause serious environmental damage (some types of detergent causing damage to aquatic life springs most readily to mind).

The problem is that a lot of the Lib Dem support was based on hype rather than ideology, so when they actually had to be in government (requiring necessary and unnecessary compromises) it was like introducing a needle to a balloon, and all the protest voters evaporated away. I do actually agree with the Lib Dem principles (of making use of the power of market and market incentivization for social good, while recognizing that economic stability requires government intervention, and then of pragmatic environmentalism, of social liberalism and of civil liberties), so I will probably stick with them, although I could switch to Ed Miliband (who seems a basically decent guy) if the economy doesn't pick up, or if the Lib Dems violate their core principles, and allow that internet snooping bill to be introduced.

true,KissYourButtGoodbye,null,null,"&gt;How do you get the word out that women should watch Doctor Who because it's a woman without making it look like a blatant gimmick?

See, now *that's* sexist.  Assuming that women's interest level in science fiction like Doctor Who is entirely, or even largely, based on whether the main heroic character is female or not?  Totally bonkers.

&gt;Moffat's women have all gravitated towards one ideal: a slinky flirty sexy gun-toter who kicks ass.

This is a bad thing?  Would it be better if he wrote sissy, stereotypical women that act like they have to slink back to the Doctor to save the day for them and have no genuine ""self""? 

Besides, there are plenty of character differences between the long-term women characters on the show.  Just because they all ""kick ass"" doesn't mean they all do it for the same reasons.  Or in the same manner.  

All of the women are written to kick ass on occasion - as well as all the male characters, if you noticed - for one reason, *and one alone*... otherwise, it is *boring*. It would *always* be ""Oh, no! There is/are *insert villain(s) of the episode here*!  Let's get the Doctor, because otherwise we are *totally helpless*.""  Sure, the Doctor is the one to save the day in the end, but if the companions don't try, don't stand up to the Doctor if they disagree, don't display any emotions but fear, really, this becomes rote.  Boring.  Formulaic beyond reasonable considerations.  Just not fun, anymore.

Proportional representation would probably help but the only way we will ever get it is if the Lib Dems or one of the other smaller parties wins an outright majority, Labour and the Tories will never agree to it. If that was a possibility then we wouldn’t need PR in  the first place.

true,Sjreed,null,null,"My predictions are pretty optimistic:

Transport - Nobody will drive and Google cars will co-ordinate a car based system, making it twice as fast and efficient, and allowing taxis/cars to be called via smartphone/glasses/jewellery, this will also change the layout of cars to focus on comfort, like mini living rooms. You'll be able get flights to Australia in under an hour, people will take space vacations and there will cruises that are the size of small islands moving around the world with people living on them permanently. 

Energy: Renewable energy will have been made so efficient that energy will be practically free once you purchase converters and storing systems. This will be the case for cars as well and electric solar will be the norm.  

Food: Not much change, but prices will drop as efficiency gains continue and the process is fully automated and controlled digitally by robotics. 

Employment: Will be around 50% and will earn high wages, the other 50% will receive enough state welfare to live comfortably and not pushed to find proper jobs, but create value to society in other ways such as volunteering, arts, building good relationships, ect.

Politics: A new party known as something like the ""future party"" (possibly even the pirate party) will form based on science, technology, digital opportunities and freedom and fairness and be a competitive player, other parties will need to adapt to remain relevant and will eventually be forced to offer full transparency and digital democracy on most issues. This will start with a strong presence of pirate party members from different countries gaining weight in European parliament and creating a type of digital bill of rights.   

Healthcare: will be totally different, 24 hour monitoring of your body for diagnosis using technology (i.e you scan yourself with your phone) will be available and anything dangerous will be picked up as soon as it appears, treatment will be as simple as walking into a medical booth and having a scan to remove whatever bad thing you have or given a pill to get rid of it and all surgery will be performed by robots, with a high success rate. 

Everyone will have a personal digital assistant who lives in the cloud  and organises your life communicating with other digital assistants, these will be designed to make your life better in many ways such as increasing your happiness by measuring what makes you most happy and suggest timetabling your life to fit these in, i.e meet certain people, go to specific events, get enough exercise as well as taking care of trivial things. Everything will be connected to the internet and adapt to your measured preferences, things like light bulbs will set on the optimal setting, taps will give the perfect temperature water and wardrobes will suggest the best outfits for a specific purpose.

I randomly picked Chelsea because they were a 5* team and I liked the name, then they became my team on FIFA.  I bought the game the next day then started learning about the players, how the competitions work, transfers, etc.

Fast forward about 5 years and EPL/soccer is my favorite sport to follow (or maybe a close second to my beloved OSU Buckeyes) and I can't get enough.

But I do get your point about the Doctor being different.  But that doesn't require him to be male.  Rory's characterization is much like Amy's and River's in that stereotypical ""sexy badass"" sense.  He wouldn't be a good fit for the Doctor, either.  But just because the current characters are one way doesn't mean that is the only way that things can be written.

For all you know, they could write the Doctor as if the next generation were male, and then just tweak it a bit to get a more feminine flair to it.  Still *the Doctor*, but with a female tweak.  Just a small one.  Barely noticeable.

 I think the theft works differently than most people think.

To me the only notable robbery the super rich commit, (aside fraud, breaking the law etc.) Is via the state not at its expense. Securing lucrative contracts, (often corruptly) securing legislation to harm competitors. Most importantly for bankers to get subsidised 0.25% interest loans, (talk about mates rates)... That they speculate with driving up prices food, oil etc. Loans from the bank of England, (it's self a private company) Which makes profit from the interest of the money it creates on computers... The greatest robbery of all? Our national debt, making us debt slaves to the banking class.

In short seeing as in my view that the state had been perverted not to defend our persons and property but for the rich to rob us. The less money that they get the happier I am, where it goes makes me cringe... NHS you say? Well maybe.

Napoleon Bonaparte that nearly bankrupted Britain, beaten by George Washington, famous for being able to stand up in a dinghy.  That George Washington?  If it weren't for the Napoleonic Wars George Washington would have been rubbed from history in 1812.

The Dr that argued the case and won for George Washington must have been one silvery tongued devil!

Even then what was Rommel doing on the list?  Sure he fought with the other side and was a military genius, he also refused to enact the Commando Order against British and Commonwealth troops, stood back with one tidal day to go that would allow the D-Day landings meaning German armour wasn't on the beaches, and received a public lament in the House of Commons when his death was announced.

Mustafa Kemal Atatürk makes the list.  He didn't stop the invasion anymore than dysentery did.  Was he successful, of course.  Was it because he was a great foe - no, it was because they were all dying of the shits.

Britain's single greatest foe who commanded on the battlefield from the 17th century onwards, for my money, didn't even make the list.  This guy was a bastard extraordinaire, he was a genocidal dictator that actually brought his iron fist crashing down in very real terms.  He even conquered Britain (or what would be Britain but since it's anything including the 17th century that's obviously a qualifier).  He massacred Englishmen, Scots, Welsh and Irish with almost impunity.

Hands down:  Oliver Cromwell. Even if you give him a pass for the first Civil War and only look at his record after then, he still easily claims the title of big foe boss.  ",0,1334675531,null,0,true,0,c4db4aj,t3_se5nv,t1_c4db4aj,t3_se5nv,null,1428739489,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

UKIP on the other hand is very different. Their policies have nothing to do with race or 'indigenous British people' or any of that. It's a party based on the idea that British sovereignty is paramount and must never be compromised by anything, such as supranational organisations like the EU.

I'm from Toronto, Canada. My dad's German hence the name, and I've always cheered for Germany since I was a kid. Naturally my favourite player was Michael Ballack, being captain and all.  

Soccer as a sport wasn't that popular in Canada growing up so I was only a soccer fan during World Cups really, otherwise it wouldn't be on TV and there wasn't any other way to watch it. It wasn't until 2007, 2008 that I started getting into club football and watching matches. For about a year I was a neutral and it wasn't until the 2008 CL Final, where Chelsea lost, that I really became a Chelsea fan. A lot of it was down to Ballack playing for them then, but I also loved the spirit of the players. Ever since I was just taken with them, I don't think I've missed a game since midway through the 2008-2009 season.

Culturally, we are similar, but I am reminded of differences when I'm asked 'why do you do this?' at things I take for granted.

When I lived in the Netherlands - there were more than enough Brits living there - that I could have chosen to never have any Dutch friends, if I was that mental.

There are a lot of English-speaking students from the UK attending universities in the Netherlands. It's much cheaper to go to university in the Netherlands (and be taught in English) than it is to go to university in England, after the fees were blasted into the stratosphere.

Politically, the UK have always formed stronger ties with the larger EU states. that's enough from me about politics.

As for knowing people from these countries, it really depends where you live (and work, really) in the UK. I've found that if you live in a major city that has a lot of IT and finance jobs, you'll meet lots of other Europeans.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; There are lots of ISPs who offer service using BT's network but without having to deal directly with BT Retail and their apparently poor customer service.

This is the correct answer.

I've dealt with BT loads on behalf of customers of mine, and they're the same as any shitty ISP - just fine until you have problems. When you need someone to come out and fix your line, BT are just the kind of jerks to make you spend an hour reinstalling your modem drivers or resetting your router (losing your carefully-planned configuration) even when you can prove to them that's got nothing to do with the problem. 

I had a customer who got BT Infinity, but ""just in case"" he had a second-line installed so that if anything went wrong he'd still have his old service (which he planned to cancel once Infinity was working). Infinity gave the advertised ""top speed"" (40meg download or something), but webpages loaded noticeably slower. 

For a while he had both his old service and BT Infinity, so he could switch between them by choosing the other wifi network - every time webpages would load visibly faster on his old 3meg ADSL service from Eclipse. In gaming terms this equates to internet ""latency"". 

If BT can offer you Infinity, then other ISPs can also offer you a FTTC / FTTH service over the very same lines. Choose one of them and you'll have a much better service. ",0,1334681223,null,0,true,0,c4dcdwr,t3_sd44v,t1_c4dcdwr,t1_c4d7hh7,null,1428740090,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'm not really as optimistic as you when it comes to our individual players.  No doubt they're quality and they all have the potential to form a great team, but how many times have you seen potential unfulfilled? Malouda looked like a world beater for a couple months last year, then went right back to mediocrity.  Aaron Ramsey was brimming with potential before his injury, now at the end of this year, most Arsenal fans don't even want him near the pitch.  Think of all the players from our own team that never really shined like they should've.  You say all they need is confidence, but that is a much bigger ask than you seem to credit it with.

After reading what you read about wanting loud and busy but not dirty i'd say that Marketgate and Waverly House are good choices, they've both been renovated this year and are both in great locations.

My honest opinion is that if you like clubbing and you really want to get into the social side of uni you'll be much better off living in the centre. From my personal experience the community is fairly segregated, those living in the city are more into the underground music scene (Drum and Bass, Garage, House, Dubstep) which is absolutely amazing in Bristol, where as those living on campus are really into clubs such as Oceana and other more commercial bars/clubs. Whilst you'll have an amazing time at both, I'd advise you pick depending on what your currently interested in.

Feel free to PM me if you want to know anything else, I'd like to say I know Bristol and the UWE halls pretty well.

If anything UKIP were *the* party that stood up to the BNP at the last European election.  The BNP wanted to make a deal with UKIP, they even tried to infiltrate a UKIP members meeting to propose that UKIP and BNP would not run candidates against one another.  Not only did UKIP call the police to remove the imposters, those sitting on the UKIP board called a vote there and then to vote unanimously to reject all the BNP's calls and to field candidates wherever there was a BNP candidate, so those voters that were anti-EU didn't have to feel that they had to resort to supporting the BNP.

The idea of smearing the lines between UKIP and the BNP is cowardly politics made by those least able to form a coherent, informed argument.  The very dirty politics that those condemn in the two main parties suddenly becomes a battlecry, marking themselves as no different, when it comes to attacking UKIP.

I would expect the inflation for real essentials to be far higher that those on the poverty line spend nearly all their income on. There should be an inflation measure that just takes into account the basics in life and those linked to the true costs of living on their own. 

The inflation figure really matters to those that live hand to mouth or when pension rises are linked to it. When you have to make the decision to stay warm or feed yourself the items in the basket such as private school fees, wallpaper paste, livery charges and caravans are completely irrelevant.

So 7 of the top 20 entries are down to individuals taking out unemployment insurance rather than state provided unemployment benefits.

In the UK it isn't common for people to take out unemployment insurance. If you could could choose to opt out of NI and pay that amount into private income protection and healthcare instead, the UK would be higher up the list.

true,amelin,eu,European Union,"&gt; Politically, you never hear of the British PM negotiating with the leaders of these other countries, nor forming alliances with them in the EU.

Reinfeldt and Cameron are considered close allies, so your observation here might say more about how the EU is covered in the daily media in the UK than about the relationship.

Here's [Cameron](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSU84NdV50I) five years ago, in Sweden to learn from Reinfeldt how to reinvent a party, get out of opposition and into government.

In 2010, Cameron and Reinfeldt announced a joint green jobs [initiative](http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/uk-and-sweden-to-create-green-jobs/).

A bit over a year ago Cameron hosted the Swedish PM at #10, as covered by the [FT](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bdf9161e-1f6d-11e0-87ca-00144feab49a.html). They also comment on education reform ideas having been imported from Sweden. 

Elsewhere the FT quotes Cameron as follows:
&gt;“Why the Nordic and Baltic countries?” Mr Cameron said. “It’s simple. Right across the north of Europe there stretches an alliance of common interests. We get enterprise. We embrace innovation. We understand the potential of green technologies for economic growth. At a time when much of Europe is in desperate need of fundamental economic reform, it makes sense for us to come together for the benefit of all our economies: an ‘avant garde’ for jobs and growth.” 

Here is the [Economist](http://www.economist.com/node/18010449?story_id=18010449) about Cameron and the Nordic countries.

In case all of that seems like old news, [this](http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/har-tar-cameron-reinfeldts-hand/) is an article about Cameron meeting Reinfeldt at the recent Northern Future Forum.

true,ashuri,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"Like I said, they are not multiculturalist but monoculturalist, promotion of 'Britishness' identity and culture is their thing. And that would require some kind of state control, hence it is authoritarian (to a degree) and not liberal or libertarian. On the flip side, the authoritarian argument is also the case for promotion of multiculturalism too (see New Labour). 

Again, I would argue that their stance on immigration and military spending are not libertarian, the core of libertarian belief is that the state should have little to no power. Both these stances require a large state. Their stance on military spending and immigration (stemming from this strong, nationalistic belief in the nation state) comes from traditional conservatism, not libertarianism. 

A libertarian would not call for an increase in military spending but should support a military sufficient to defend their sovereignty, but not for attacking.

Restriction of immigration is not libertarian because it is not the business of the state to interfere with the free movement of capital and labor, doing so is authoritarian. [This](http://noborderswales.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/libertarian-hmmmm/) is a nice blog post about free movement in liberarianism.

Gay marriage. The government shouldn't get involved in religion, this fits with a libertarian belief (small state, etc). But it is not socially liberal, liberalism calls for maximum liberty unless it impacts on another.

There is a difference between 'big L' Libertarianism as espoused the the British and American Libertarian Parties, and libertarianism as a whole. 

Nigel Farage himself says his aim with UKIP is:
 &gt;""the development of the party into broadly standing for traditional conservative and libertarian values"".

Traditionally conservative first, libertarian second.

It is dangerous however to conflate what UKIP stands for as xenophobic, when in actual fact they did more than any party in the UK European elections to *attack* and limit the BNP.  If you actually look at where most of the UKIP MEPs come from it isn't the typical heartlands synonymous with racial tension.  You risk maligning the second largest part of society that voted for UKIP and drawing the perception of the BNP closer to the mainstream, which it is not.   UKIP and the BNP are not the same, UKIP has even moved to alienate them despite them being anti-EU.

Nigel Farage is often grating and brisk, but what can't be said is that he's be proven wrong in his predictions so far.  He warned about the financial crisis for lack of oversight, he warned about a militant rise in nationalism, he warned about an encroaching and growing commission, he warned about an encroachment on democracy, that when Ireland voted no they'd call for a second referendum; all well in advance, and sadly he's been proven right.  He's been saying for over 2 years that if Spain needs a bailout it will be 7x the size required for Ireland and at that point all the bailout money will be gone - and that's exactly where we're at.

Criticise the way he speaks, although he certainly is not xenophobic, but level head or not he came to, and warned of, the actual present day scenario with foresight.

As an island we can have tighter controls on what gets into the country, and although it isn't perfect I don't know anyone that's ever seen a gun not held by Police.

If every Policeman had a gun, I would want one too. But they don't. It works for us.

Have you ever spent much time in the UK? Seen a downside to our gun laws? 

This post is pointless in this sub, whitewashing British people with a 'British stereotype' is stupid. As a country we're done with the gun debate. You can have a gun if you are law enforcement facing criminals with guns. You can have a gun if you're a farmer to shoot animals trying to eat your animals. And you can have a gun if you keep it in a special locked box in a special 'gun' shooting range with extra tight security, if the purpose of that gun is too hit a target in a controlled environment for sport.

I'm not hostile to gun owning Americans, I'd love to live in USA and have a collection. 

Can you answer me one question though. It's a question that seems to get gun owners backs up, but it is a serious question and I am not trolling.

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"OK, so this is just about close enough to some research I'm doing at the moment that I took the time to look into tehse claims.

[According to this release linked from the article](http://www.dwp.gov.uk/newsroom/press-releases/2012/mar-2012/dwp026-12.shtml), 1.5 million people began to be reassessed in October 2010.  Of those, 92% have received a decision - i.e. 1.38 million.  Of those 37% have been declared fit for work - i.e. 516,000.  Of those, approximately 1,664 have died over the last year - this gives a mortality rate of approx. 322 deaths per 100,000.


Mortality rate statistics are available [here](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/mortality-ageing/mortality-in-the-united-kingdom/mortality-in-the-united-kingdom--2010/mortality-in-the-uk-2010.html) and a population breakdown [here]((http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/dvc1/UKPyramid.html).

We should assume that benefits apply only to people of working age - due to the limits of the mortality statistics, we'll have to use 15-59 (which will likely underestimate the mortality rate).

*In 2010:-*

The male mortality rate was 655 per 100,000.

With 30,183,300 men, this gives 197,700 male deaths.

14.1% of male deaths were in the 15-59 year age bracket.

That means there were 27,875 15-59 y/o male deaths in 2010.

The female mortality rate was 467 per 100,000.

With 30,668,000 women, this gives 143,219 female deaths.

8.3% of female deaths were in the 15-59 year age bracket.

That means there were 11,887 15-59 y/o female deaths in 2010.

This gives a total of 39762 deaths in the 15-59 age bracket.
There are 37,322,200 people in that age bracket.
This gives as a mortality rate of 106 per 100,000.

This is an absolute best case figure - it includes people with a lower mortality rate (15-18) and excludes people with a higher mortality rate (60-65).  In reality, that figure would likely be closer to 150 but I can't find sufficiently detailed statistics to be sure of this.

In reality, the mortality rate amongst those who have been removed from benefits is probably twice as high as the general population for that age group.  While this is not, of course, desirable, it does not in any way suggest that being removed from benefits is killing these people - factors such as [race (in the US; no such statistics are recorded in the UK)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC535447/) and class are known to be connected to equally large variations in mortality rate.  Indeed the observed discrepancy could almost be explained [by claimants living in Scotland](http://www.poverty.org.uk/60/index.shtml).

true,Rotgrub,null,null,"&gt;Like I said, they are not multiculturalist but monoculturalist

Not at all.  You can't be British in the common sense and not be multiculturalist.  You can argue for sovereignty and still embrace several cultures.  There is no cultural distinction as such to UKIP.  UKIP doesn't run on race, if someone is legally here regardless of their background, ethnicity or culture UKIP has no problem with identifying them as British. 

&gt;And that would require some kind of state control, hence it is authoritarian (to a degree) and not liberal or libertarian.

And the major point UKIP has, and has drawn, with the EU is that it has bled from democracy; from the Commission to the Irish referendum, to powers going to Brussels, to the interim government imposed on Greece.  *All* libertarian values wanting a smaller central EU government.

&gt;Again, I would argue that their stance on immigration and military spending are not libertarian, the core of libertarian belief is that the state should have little to no power. Both these stances require a large state. 

I'm a proud social libertarian.  I share few domestic policies with UKIP.  I'm anti-EU (for the UK) but not anti-immigration.  I have no problem however justifying a strong state military, education system and NHS with my libertarian values.  This isn't the US.  Libertarian needn't mean a winnowed government in that sense.  In fact I'd go as far to argue that strong state education, health, welfare and military is a prerequisite of a stable social libertarian society.

&gt;Their stance on military spending and immigration (stemming from this strong, nationalistic belief in the nation state) comes from traditional conservatism, not libertarianism. 

And here I am as a staunch libertarian to tell you that you're wrong. The nationalism in me is particularly weak.

&gt;A libertarian would not call for an increase in military spending but should support a military sufficient to defend their sovereignty, but not for attacking.

Not necessarily, but I'd certainly argue for a more defensive posture.  A modern military is hardly ever an either or however.  A strong defensive military almost certainly requires an effective offensive capability.  A country with overseas territories, ties to the Commonwealth, and Europe, doubly so.  In this instance UKIP isn't against strong ties with Europe, it actively promotes a trade agreement with the rest of Europe and the EU.  UKIP doesn't argue that there aren't shared European interests.

&gt;Restriction of immigration is not libertarian because it is not the business of the state to interfere with the free movement of capital and labor, doing so is authoritarian.

Immigration has little to nothing to do with a state's libertarian status of how it deals with its citizens.  I'd go further - it need have nothing to do with it.  I continue this on your next point...

&gt;This is a nice blog post about free movement in liberarianism.

Libertarianism is a very broad umbrella term that covers the full extent of the left-right political spectrum...and that is far from a nice, or accurate, blog!  I'm completely okay with open immigration as it goes, unlike UKIP, but neither stance disregards the libertarian nature of either.

&gt;Gay marriage. The government shouldn't get involved in religion, this fits with a libertarian belief (small state, etc). But it is not socially liberal, liberalism calls for maximum liberty unless it impacts on another.

UKIP is all for allowing gay equality.  That's libertarian - any way you cut it.

&gt;&gt;""the development of the party into broadly standing for traditional conservative and libertarian values"".

&gt;Traditionally conservative first, libertarian second.

Nope, you just implied that.  You can be both conservative with a small c and libertarian with a small l or a big L equally at the same time, or in either order, or in any combination or permutation.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"Someone should remind that c**t Szczesny you have to be in the Semi-Finals to get knocked out by Barca, getting buttfucked 4-0 at the San Siro in Feb won't cut it

Fabregas saying how much he enjoyed watching us get knocked out in 2009, some chat about Lampard? Piss off Cesc, you have 1 FA Cup to your name. Frank is a legend and has 3 FA Cups, 3 Premierships and several records to his. More importantly, he has the class to reject Barca (his ex-wife's influence) and stick with the club he loves. It isn't hard to do one after Arsenal threw everything they could offer at you, something we all saw coming because you talked about it non-stop for years

Dani Alves can also fuck right off. Few players are as pathetic and theatrical on the pitch, doing whatever they can to get opposition players sent off. We didn't lose because we lacked courage, we lost because some dick referee allowed your lot to use every illegal move under the sun. Handball, fouls in the box, you guys covered the lot and got away with it constantly. A fucking disgrace as Didier pointed out once or twice

We all know Barca are the favourites, it would be so easy for our lads to start piping up with the mind games. The worst we've said is ""Barca can be beaten."" As a club, I can't fucking stand Barca, this holier than thou 'we do things the right way' attitude and everybody should seek to emulate us. Give me a break, you tap up players constantly, dive like an olympian, spend more money than almost anyone while claiming the exact opposite and play your mind-numbing tiki taka against teams that  are scared to get near you. Blessed with some of the greatest players in the modern game, Messi, Xavi, Iniesta, Puyol never stoop to the level of Busquets, Pedro, Alves. Too many bad apples 

I rarely get so wound up but with Barca it's different. This shit is personal. I've never screamed louder than when we saw JT bury that header, I've never been more furious than the aftermath of 2009's farce. The Chelsea we've known and loved for years now is changing, this is the chance our boys will have been dreaming about for years. For Lampard, Terry, Drogba, Cole, Essien, Cech, Essien, Malouda, Ivanovic, Mikel, Kalou; the remnants of that travesty, this is their chance to right the wrong. I can't think of a finer farewell for some of our legends than to see off the nemesis, as Churchill would say, ""This would be their finest hour""

And you know, I think we just might do it as well. I know most of you here don't go to games, rest assured the Bridge tomorrow will be louder than it's ever been. I'll be watching a Blue victory tomorrow, sitting quietly at the Nou Camp on Saturday as Real hopefully seal up La Liga and sticking around to watch our boys complete the job in Spain. Time to bring Barca down a notch

Trying to find out time scales of how long it would take to get treatment. now that I had been referred. he/she never responded. I was then discharged. Went back to GP to try to get referred again; This took a year and in  July 2011 I was seen by a senior doctor who preceded to tear strips of me and basically take the piss out of my situation. Told me I would get treatment over her dead body pretty much. She did say she would get me in for another appointment  (for what Im not quite sure) but again never heard back from her again either. Went back to GP again, To ask if I could get a second opinion or something. Some months later had a letter back saying that my previous appointment was a second opinion ?. Even though i had only ever seen 1 person at the place. In October 2011 getting pretty desperate and being driven to the point of being suicidal and starting to loose perspective on reality (spending upto a month at a time alone is not good for you). Went to the GP to thump my fist on the desk and say this isn't good enough. And got the ""we have the right to do our job without the the fear of threat or intimidation"" treatment pretty much standard play for anyone trying to complain in this day and age. My GP did get the crisis team involved because she could see i was not well. Got a call from the crisis team (these people are the ones called in when someone is looking likely to kill themselves) the guy spoke to me for an hour assured me he would get to the bottom of it all and promised faithfully that he would contact me again and would not let me down etc.etc. Never heard from him again. You could not make this shit up. For all mental health know I could of topped my self back in October and still be rotting in my flat. No follow up no contact nothing. I have kept my sanity for the most part but the have been times were I have drifted in to the strange thoughts area of things.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"I don't know how many times we have to explain how little this theory makes sense, but here goes:

Rory's not been more agitated or hostile, he's just been more decicive witth his actions. He's never been cruel or malicious or even short-tempered with those he loves. Even when Amy [The Girl Who Waited SPOILERS:](/s ""was trapped for thirty-six years and treated him with bitterness""), he still found empathy and love for her. He similarly shows compassion to [The Rebel Flesh SPOILERS:](/s ""the Gangers"") when even Amy wouldn't.

Secondly, Rory complains of a headache because he (like the viewing audience) is blown away by the sheer ridiculous incomprehensibility  that is [Let's Kill Hitler SPOILERS:](/s ""realizing his best friend is also his daughter, is also River Song"") and wants to cool off for a minute.

Thirdly, the alarm noise is called the Cloister Bell. It has no ties to the Master in particular and goes off *whenever* the TARDIS is on the verge of dying or is caught up in an emergency. It also has been linked to signaling the Doctor's death (as seen in Legopolis and arguably in Waters of Mars).

Fourth, Rory did not have a room in The god Complex because the point of the ""hotel"" was [The God Complex SPOILERS:](/s ""not to simply scare people or show them their fears, but to expose the raw emotional energy connecting them with what they had faith in. Rory had no faith and hence had no room"").

Fifth, how could Rory even *be* the Master? Amy had an entire childhood with him (Let's Kill Hitler) and the Master [End of Time SPOILERS:](/s ""is currently trapped within the Time Lock""). Similarly, what does the Master have to gain by pretending to be Rory? It's not like they'd use the [Utopia SPOILERS:](/s ""Master in human body through use of a Fob Watch"") plot *again*.

It's an absolute classic and is still consistently brilliant and has had Fry and a lot of other QI regulars on over the years.

He only left because he shit talked about Rafa and was upset for not starting every game.  If we're looking to the upper end of the spectrum, Juan Mata went to Chelsea for around 20 mil.  Don't forget that we put in a serious bid for him, but got snubbed.  He instantly slotted into the premier league and is one of Chelsea's best players this year.  Good players are out there, and though you always take a risk, I'd hope that the people in charge would take a deal if they spotted one.  I'm not in tune enough to know any 'killer deals' out there myself.

I think Adam is a useful squad player who had to play a little too often this year.  Good for competition in the midfield, backup for injury, and cup competitions.  Is Downing someone I want to see play every game though? Not really, at least not on this years performances.  I'd like to see a right winger with some flair brought in to balance with Downing's classic byline winger type.  Swapping flanks throughout the game to confuse the defense, a pair like that could work well.  Right now our wingers are getting on (Maxi 31, Bellamy 32) and having Downing without other backup doesn't make me confident exactly.  He seems like a player who does well when the team does well, but won't pull a rabbit out of a hat to bring you into a game.

Henderson I have high hopes for as well.  Once every few games, he will do something crazy out of nowhere.  Usually it'll be a bomb forward or trick to beat a man and open up a ton of space, but he shows he's got something special in him.  It'll take a long time for him to have the confidence to control the midfield and lead the team, possibly several years, but I'm willing to wait.  Completely agree with your comparison to Lucas in that regard.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"I don't know how many times we have to explain how little this theory makes sense, but here goes:

Rory's not been more agitated or hostile, he's just been more decicive witth his actions. He's never been cruel or malicious or even short-tempered with those he loves. Even when Amy [The Girl Who Waited SPOILERS:](/s ""was trapped for thirty-six years and treated him with bitterness""), he still found empathy and love for her. He similarly shows compassion to [The Rebel Flesh SPOILERS:](/s ""the Gangers"") when even Amy wouldn't.

Secondly, Rory complains of a headache because he (like the viewing audience) is blown away by the sheer ridiculous incomprehensibility  that is [Let's Kill Hitler SPOILERS:](/s ""realizing his best friend is also his daughter, is also River Song"") and wants to cool off for a minute.

Thirdly, the alarm noise is called the Cloister Bell. It has no ties to the Master in particular and goes off *whenever* the TARDIS is on the verge of dying or is caught up in an emergency. It also has been linked to signaling the Doctor's death (as seen in Legopolis and arguably in Waters of Mars).

Fourth, Rory did not have a room in The god Complex because the point of the ""hotel"" was [The God Complex SPOILERS:](/s ""not to simply scare people or show them their fears, but to expose the raw emotional energy connecting them with what they had faith in.

Firstly a little background info;

* I run an [Etsy store](http://www.etsy.com/shop/colincapurso) that primarily sells (and designs) Doctor Who decals.

* Recently I had been giving away free decals every month in r/doctorwho.

* More recently I had to stop doing that due to being broke.

* Even more recently though, the BBC has asked to have most of my items taken down, which has left my store fairly close to empty. I don't like that that has happened, but they make a great show that I truely love so i'm ok with it.

So this is it. **I'm shutting up shop** and **giving away all the decals I have left to fellow redditors**. I'll do it over the next few weeks/months randomly, so I recommend you stop by r/doctorwho frequently :)

Thanks to everyone that bought decals from my shop!

Russ, Kate and Garthy. They were absolutely fantastic. They left to go to star 107.5 - I'm unsure if they are still there, but they used to have my sides splitting before I'd walked out the door.

Sadly, Radio in Gloucestershire has been hideously commercialised with repeats of the chart toppers followed by awful adverts with Jingles that rot your soul and mind for the rest of the day. It was after this commercialisation and R, K and G left Severn sound I stopped listening to FM radio. /rant

**However!** I know there are countless internet radio stations on the internet and devices (such as Mobile apps if you have an android or Windows based phone) that can receive them for you. You would literally be able to find a radio station for anything ^(^even ^Gaydar). If you have a personal computer, Winamp is a good media player for receiving radio stations. For example, I had my computer switch itself on, load winamp by itself and set winamp to start playing a internet radio station. That worked very well!

true,mszegedy,tennant,Tennant,"Are you a student of German? I know decent German, but the language I study is Latin. My native language is Hungarian, however. We have uncountably many cases (the ""I lost count at twenty-six"" kind), all having to do with prepositions. The instrumental case, also part of Hungarian, simply means ""with"", excepting the sense in which it is used with a person, in which case it is sociative, which is also a case in Hungarian.

Noun case is a funnily abstract thing. You can invent a million, if you like, to fullfill whatever order you may have for your noun. They can indicate morphosyntactic alignment. They may indicate a prepositional clause. They may *replace* a prepositional clause. The case is defined by the inflection of the noun in a particular situation, rather than the cases defining the situations wherein a noun can reside.

Case is actually quite powerless in this aspect. You can *say* that, a noun, when inflected in this manner, means a particular thing. Then, that manner of inflection is a case. But you can't fabricate a case that orders the noun to behave in the way to mean that particular thing. Case is descriptive; it is impossible to make a list of all particular cases, because that list is infinite. For, for every finite list, I could invent a language that has nouns that inflect in a way not covered by any of the cases on your list. This works for practically every aspect of linguistics, in fact. Even tense: I could invent a tense that always refers to the exact time that Gavrilo Princip shot Archduke Ferdinand (which is around 1914, June 28, 10:45 AM), and that would be a new tense! I could invent a tense each for every point in time, down to infinite subdivisions. Some cultures have tenses for the time of and following the beginning of the universe, the Ancestral Past, or somesuch. There is always more ground to cover when working with linguistic properties.

And this does happen to linguists working in the field! What they will usually do... what are the only things they are CAPABLE of doing is one of two things:

1. Use an existing name for that particular method of inflection. This is the default choice. This leads to extensive confusion sometimes: the Latin ablative, for example, has practically nothing to do with the actual prescriptive meaning of ""ablative"", which means that the noun in question is being moved away from (so, essentially a substitute for our preposition ""from""). Why they chose to stick it under ablative, only God knows. A better choice would have been ""oblique"", or possibly ""instrumental"", the former of which is often used to describe cases that do a great number of different things (which the Latin ablative sure does). See what I did there? I called it the ""Latin"" ablative. This is what enda up happening to property names that are co-opted by this. For example, in moods, there is the French subjunctive, the Spanish subjunctive, the Latin subjunctive, the *English* subjunctive (essentially an imperative clause with the subject stated as well), and I suppose one could also even refer to the Hungarian subjunctive. What does the subjunctive mood actually do, you ask? No one knows anymore! They have had to split it up, because it had been co-opted into oblivion. It is an appropriate thing for me to refer to, for example, the ""jussive subjunctive"", which typically describes the subjunctive being used in an imperative fashion (this actually replaces the imperative in Hungarian). Take the case of Latin. They can't call it the imperative, because that particular inflection paradigm is used elsewhere in the language as well. They can't call it the imperative subjunctive, either, because Latin *also* has an imperative mood, with subtle differences between the two. But they still have to have a different name for each mood, and so they apply names used so obnoxiously to describe similar moods in other languages.
1. Invent a new name for the property, typically with Latin roots (take a look at every single case in the list I have for Gallifreyan: linguists came up with these names on the fly). This is only employed when the property is radically different from any other existing one in any other language, that already has a name. I did this in my language: I talked about a ""substitutive"" case, which describes the noun being replaced by something else. This name didn't exist until I came up with it. Yet, no name existed at that point to serve my purpose. So, I came up with one that any other linguist would have come up with, that describes the purpose of the case most accurately. It requires little thought, but leads to long lists and destroys nuance.
1. This isn't a third option, just what idiot came up with the name ""possessed case""?

So, in conclusion, use whatever cases work for you, and only those. Once you start trying to use one language to describe all others, this gets really messy! Hey, idea: just call linguistic properties whatever they are called in their language. It's universal...

...but it's not immediately obvious from the name what it does, and a lot of times languages have properties that match exactly (cases that operate on morphosyntactic alignment are this: direct, nominative, accusative, ergative, absolutive, intransitive, and transitive are all objective. Unless you have split-ergativity, but that's a small minority). Fuck, just forget it, just keep using our stupid system of organization like an asshole. It's the best we can do. :(

* Places the initial spotlight on [Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Cy-9U0S08WY#t=30s).

* High-concept story: [Hide and go seek...](http://fuuu.us/29.png) [with gas-mask zombies!](http://fuuu.us/402.png)

*  The London Blitz, for the first time under Moffat's pen.

*  Cliffhanger to leave the newbies craving for more...  Always a plus ;)

* (Ab)use of psychic paper, sonic screwdriver, [sonic blaster and bananas.  *Bananas are good.*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=MgiE0AZ_Dgs#t=57s) XD

true,nonlinearmedia,uk,"London, England","I have complained to pals they just did their best to convince me not to file a complaint then ran me round in circles for a number of months before ignoring my letters.

 I have also spoken to the ombudsman that was over a year ago so my memory is a bit hazy, but in short the is a snag something to do with they will not get involved in a case if the is possibility of taking a litigation. cant remember which way round it is but one negates the other. The thing with the ombudsman as well is that it can take years and you may only get a letter of apology with no acceptance of responsibility or more importantly treatment. I have found all these avenues to be window dressing with little effect. I think the saying goes "" the foxes guarding the chickens. the number of real wins is minute and changes nothing its all bread and circuses. At this time the complaints systems are also about to collapse due to overload.

Getting a straight answer of what your ""rights"" and ""choices"" are is also a moving feast it seems. You just don't know were you stand. I spent one afternoon going through google to phone up lawyers who deal with ""mental health care negligence"" not because I wanted to sue but I just want to pick their brains to try and find out were I do stand
I phoned around 8 form the google search and ALL of them ALL !! said they were not taking on new cases because they were so busy. Houston I think we have a problem.

 Thing is when your depressed your will to fight is limited. I mean I have been trying for over three years. I think particularly in the case of Southwark they know this and they use that and suicide to manage patient load. I know this sounds controversial but its really really piss poor the attitude is totally fucked, insane. The percentage of people in Southwark that kill them selves having had recent contact with mental health care services is through the roof shocking in fact. And like many when I first read the stat I didn't think much of it because hay mental people kill themselves right? But after trying to access the service myself I have absolutely no doubt the is the blood of many on the hands of certain individuals in mental health care services in Southwark. And its not just the patients it the family's that often get destroyed as well. the utterly shit management of mental health in Southwark is a scandal. Whats really depressing (sorry about the pun) is that CMH service are being ""reorganised"" right now and its so clearly just a PR exercise the same suspects are still just firing off discharge notices and asking questions later.

The whole attitude towards suicidal people reminds me of the medieval dunking stools they used on ""witches"". they ignore people presenting as suicidal. and then when people do kill themselves they are like oh yeah they were suicidal. oh well they are at peace now move alone nothing to see here.

We should not be scared like this to find that there in fact are things weighing down one scalepan when there very much are also things weighing down the other scalepan too. Just because you may have a point doesn't make you right. There always are arguments for both sides, [including the, on balance, very wrong one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocatus_diaboli). In this case the extremely slight, tenuous, even hypothetical fear that one *could* be seen to be endorsing a commercial company is more than balanced out by all kinds of other factors that are much more important. (And it's hard to think how any reasonable could think this was a BBC endorsement of the Virgin service.)

&gt; There are rules they have to abide by.

That statement has zero information content in this context, and if you think it supports your position, you may be in fact be authoritarian. I too could say almost anything and then conclude with ""There are rules [people] have to abide by"", thereby implicitly postulating that (A) what I've just said is right, (B) what I've just postulated reflects ""the rules"" and (C) people have to abide by them. None of these are a given of course. Rules for example can be [extremely wrong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws), and rules should only be abided by if they're just, and they're only just if they strike a good balance (see above).

Do keep in mind that BBC UK is fully publically funded. (no ads anywhere on BBC UK's property)

Indeed, it seems tenuous to think that that ad could be misconstrued as the BBC endorsing Virgin over other cable networks. 

But the Trust has apparently very specific rules on what can and cannot be done with BBC owned property, *because* they get their funding from the public (from the TV License fees). Ofcom often overreacts as well, and that makes for a very tight rope to do the foxtrot on.

Disclaimer: I'm not affiliated with the BBC Trust, and I think that it did overreact, but I can understand their reasoning.


On a sidenote, only tangentially related to this. I think it'll be very interesting to see how the whole hubbub around The Voice UK will turn out.

People prefer to shoot each other than stab each other, by - quite a larger margin - I'm sure I'm not the only one that would so it would even go as far as to enable people. Stabbing someone is FAR more personal and less deadly than say (let's use your example) .40 Caliber round tearing through someones vital organs and leaving a Nice exit hole on the other side as well as a shitty mess on the pavement...

At the moment we're 5 points to up to Arsenal, with a game in hand (could be shortened to 2 points if we win) and 2 points down to Chelsea.

    3 | Arsenal     | 34 | 64
    4 | Spurs         | 33 | 59
    5 | Newcastle | 33 | 59
    6 | Chelsea     | 33 | 57

Let's assume that we'll lose our 34th game, to get a clear picture of what will happen.

    3 | Arsenal     | 34 | 64
    4 | Spurs         | 34 | 59
    5 | Newcastle | 33 | 59
    6 | Chelsea     | 33 | 57

We can clearly see that now can both Newcastle and Chelsea overtake us. Which will put us 6th, something we do **not** want. This proves the importance of us winning our games.

But the question was who to support in the Arsenal-Chelsea game. We know that we want to finish 3^rd or 4^th. *(I will ""simulate"" some Newcastle results just because they're also in the picture, I'll let them win mostly because we're ahead of them in goal difference. I don't know the games they play but I'll assume they'll win because it's the worst result for us.)*

##If Arsenal win

The table doesn't change. We'll just have the 5 point gap again. The big difference is that it would put Chelsea at a possible 5 point gap from us (if we win our 34th game). **This would be the ""almost fail-safe"" option, but would mean we probably will end up as 4th, if we can perform like we should.**

    3 | Arsenal     | 35 | 67
    4 | Spurs         | 34 | 62
    5 | Newcastle | 34 | 62
    6 | Chelsea     | 34 | 57

    3 | Arsenal     | 35 | 67
    4 | Spurs         | 35 | 65
    5 | Newcastle | 35 | 65
    6 | Chelsea     | 35 | 60

##If it's a draw

This would probably be the most exciting outcome. It would put Chelsea 4 points from us if we win, and it would put Arsenal just 3 points ahead of us, but we got a game in hand. It would probably come down to goal difference, and I'm not sure we'll win that one. **We'll possibly finish 4th, with a slight chance of getting 3rd.**

    3 | Arsenal     | 35 | 65
    4 | Spurs         | 34 | 62
    5 | Newcastle | 34 | 62
    6 | Chelsea     | 34 | 58

##If Chelsea win

They would overtake us if we lose our 34th game. Something that we strictly do not want. It would however make it easier for us to overtake Arsenal if we win our next two games. **So this is obviously the favourable result if we manage to win our 5 remaining games, then we will finish 3rd.**

    3 | Spurs      | 35 | 65
    4 | Arsenal  | 35 | 64
    5 | Chelsea  | 35 | 63


-----

**Conclusions:**

* If you dare to dream of us ending up as 3rd, hope for a Chelsea win.
* If you just want us to secure Champions League football, hope for an Arsenal win.
* If you can't pick which matters most to you (3rd or secured Champions League), hope for a draw.

true,Niubi,eu,European Union,"Actually, I've been thinking about the 'going native' thing - that's probably what changed. I'll never be 'Greek', but there's probably a lot more cultural osmosis going on in me than I suspect. And Crete isn't mainland Greek at all - stereotypically a Cretan fulfills most US redneck stereotypes. Then you've got the intense pride all Greeks have of being the inventors of everything ever - you can have some hilarious conversations with a nationalistic Greek regarding that. Think Gus from My Big Fat Greek Wedding and the kimono argument. Cretans take that further with their minoan heritage (aka ""we're even better than those poncy gits up north""). Also, since Crete was under Ottoman rule for a few centuries, there's still quite a strong Middle Eastern mentality that's more pronounced than the mainland. 

I'm sure the other islands have equally complex identities, but having not lived on them - or even visited! - I don't feel qualified to say too much more on that. And I don't need to go into the complex regional arguments that the British Isles has! So there is one similiarity there, but fundamentally, there's not that much culturally similar between an anglo-saxon culture and a southern European culture. Something the UK press has been using against Greece lately (that's another can of worms).

Essentially, I know that the Cretan view of live has seduced me and going back to the UK, there's a dissonance between how I look at the world against how an average Brit would. There's a lot to be said for fatalism v cynicism.

There's a lot of really frustrated people out there (doesn't matter what age) that have more or less just given up and resigned themselves to nothing more than signing on every other week.  Because their life is shit and all they try to do is numb themselves through each week.

They've messed up in school and drifted while outside of it, no doubt thanks to having wonderful caring parents.  Drug use takes hold (mainly booze) then life catches up with them and things get real fast.  They struggle and to get by just drinking / wasting the world away because it gets you through another week.

No role models, little support and not having first hand experience of seeing other people make something of themselves.  All adds up.

I know a few losers that did just need a chance, sure they didn't help themselves or put much effort into trying to sort themselves out, but once they got a hand, things turned around for them.

One thing I want to do when I'm self employed (or maybe it's something I can set up even when I'm not) is take on apprentices / trainees.  I'm coming up to the end of my first course for electrical installation, and I'm hoping I can find someone out there willing to give me a shot, even though I'm getting into the industry late (30).

One day I'll be in a position to give someone else a chance, I'm looking forward to trying.  No doubt I'll get pissed around but I don't care.  The more chances people get, the more likely they'll do all right for themselves.

Not sure what my point is :/

true,jetRink,null,null,"Actually, making everyone accept lower wages during a recession is exactly what expansionary monetary policy like QE is meant to do. Here's how it works:

During a recession, real GDP (RGDP) falls. That means that on average, everyone is going to need to accept a lower real income until RGDP recovers. Ideally, businesses whose income has fallen in a recession would be able to go to their workers and ask them to accept a 10 or 20% reduction in salary until the economy is in better shape. However, in the real world, that is impossible. Economists say wages are 'sticky'. People are loathe to accept pay cuts and will even be slow to take a new job at lower pay after being laid off.

Thus, the incomes of many businesses fall, but their payroll expenses remain fixed. The only solution for businesses in this situation is to lay off workers and ask the remaining workers take up the slack. You see this effect in the increase in worker productivity that accompanies many recessions. Unfortunately, when people are laid off, it reduces their spending, further lowering RGDP and deepening the recession. The economy goes into a spiral.

Nominal GDP or NGDP is RGDP that has not been adjusted for inflation. In an economic crisis, a fall in RGDP is unavoidable, but a fall in NGDP is not. If you can use monetary policy to keep NGDP rising even while RGDP is falling, you can avoid (to some degree) the problem of layoffs that accompanies a fall in nominal wages, lessening the severity of the recession.

true,OptioMkIX,null,null,"This could be any one of a number of issues.

The F-35 development has been reasonably troubled, as have most other aircraft that try to cram a lot of innovations into one airframe.

This most recent development is possibly due to a [report released](http://www.f-16.net/news_article4494.html) that revealed problems with the tailhook design on the F35 and how its placement is something of an outlier with carrier-borne aircraft being far closer to the main landing gear than any other.

[Here is a graphic illustrating the issue.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VqEq1NKQMTc/TwagY9J7qTI/AAAAAAAAByQ/OW26Nwx3-9U/s1600/hooklocationC.png)

EDIT: As a somewhat informed opinion (Mechanical Engineering student, 15 year long interest in aviation) I'd hazard two problems.

1) The tailhook (going by the graphic) is very short and almost the same length as the main undercarriage. The arrestor wires stand a good chance of getting caught in the undercarriage and not the hook.

2) To combat this the angle of attack for landing would have to be raised so the plane is almost scraping its arse along the deck. This leads to problems with pilot visibility and the wing losing lift at these high angles.

If anyone with a better understanding can correct me on this, feel free.

There are a bunch of other issues that have arisen that are pretty worrying.

1) [Reports of defeat in combat simulation against likely adversarial aircraft.](http://www.f-16.net/news_article4416.html)

2) [Reports that a lot of features of the F35 are deficient compared to their promised performance including: 3d virtual helmet display not functioning, handling characteristic problems(Acceleration, turn radius), airframe problems (vertical stabilisers so close to the exhaust that when using afterburners for an extended test they actually burner away part of the tail), fuel system damage resistance not functioning properly.](http://www.defencetalk.com/f-35-jsf-flight-tests-highlight-new-problems-risks-of-excessive-concurrency-39639/)

3)[A laundry list of issues in this one.](http://www.f-16.net/news_article4483.html)

&gt;With this, the report states that the aircraft will not be able to perform air-to-air or air or air-to-ground missions.

&gt;Pilot training has not started at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida because the aircraft is unsafe to fly. There are restrictions on diving the F-35 because the fuel inerting system (common on aircraft like the F-16) does not have the capacity to make empty portions of the fuel system fire resistant. Also the aircraft has poor resistance to lighting strikes. It cannot be used within 25 miles of lighting conditions. Anyone that has been to Florida knows that this kind of weather is common.

&gt;The integrated power pack (IPP)—a critical aircraft system—is significantly unreliable. The IPP was expected to fly on a jet for over 2000 hours before needing to be replaced. Stopping flight test to replace the IPP is now a frequent task. It has taken up to 48 hours of continuous work to change this device.

You can neatly tie this all up with a terms &amp; conditions page where you tick an extra box upon registering an account, but for 'passing' users to websites that don't use user accounts, it'll basically either force all developers to remove any functionality involving cookies (ie. almost everything), or require users to make accounts to view the website just so they can consent instead of having to constantly tick little boxes.

This is also assuming that the world wide web is a utopia of perfect web design, which it overwhelmingly isn't. It's far more difficult to have built in redirects and minor jQuery reminders requesting a user's consent than it is to just have a big alert box appear whenever you want to click a link. Most websites will just ignore the law, or implement it really badly.

Oh, and not complying to enforcement demands is a **criminal offence** and carries a maximum fine of £500,000 (never going to be fined the full amount, but jesus).

Since nowhere in the article mentions anything specific about what Mr. Belhadj or his wife were meant to have done wrong (aside from being part of an Islamic group opposed to Col.

The fact he's willing to put his head above the parapet now so  publicly suggests that might be the case.

If the CIA kidnapped him and his wife, tortured them, then delivered them to the Gadaffi regime to be tortured, and Jack Straw signed off on that all the while claiming the UK was totally opposed to such things.....then Jack Straw should go to prison.

A particular highlight:

*""Belhaj says he was blindfolded, hooded, forced to wear ear defenders, and hung from hooks in his cell wall for what seemed to be hours. He says he was severely beaten. The ear defenders were removed only for him to be blasted with loud music, he says, or when he was interrogated by his US captors.
Bouchar says that when she was dragged away from her husband she feared he was going to be killed. ""I thought: 'This is it.' I thought I would never see my husband again ... They took me into a cell, and they chained my left wrist to the wall and both my ankles to the floor. I could sit down but I couldn't move. There was a camera in the room, and every time I tried to move they rushed in. But there was no real communication. I wasn't questioned."" Bouchar found it difficult to comprehend how she could be treated in this way: she was four-and-a-half months pregnant. ""They knew I was pregnant,"" she says. ""It was obvious."" She says she was given water while chained up, but no food whatsoever. She was chained to the wall for five days. At the end of this period she was taped to the stretcher and put aboard the aircraft, unaware of where she was going or whether her husband was on board. At one point the aircraft landed, remained on the ground for a short period and then took off again. Only when it landed a second time did she hear a man grunting with pain, and realise her husband was nearby.""*

My guess it that it was all politics to help get Gaddafi onside. He could be labeled as a Islam extremist. How were they to know the Arab spring would happen?

There's some wonderful comment (heavily biased, but still worth a read) here:

[The Register: Cameron 'to change his mind' on the one thing he got right in Defence](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/04/17/f35_carriers_plot_by_bae_and_raf/)

The allegations made about BAE's charging scheme for conversion there, if even vaguely accurate, would cause any rational project team to have a good old stop and think about their contracting decisions.

true,henleyregatta,hampshire,Hampshire,"I'm not going to argue specifics, because I don't know anything about them. From a historical perspective, this shouldn't be a surprise: every new aircraft project has has similar or worse problems during development. The absolute need to minimise weight and risk (and therefore novelty) to maintain a tight development schedule is the major underlying cause for all of these things, from the TSR-2's almost-exploding-turbine on first flight, through Harrier's wobbly nose gear, Concorde's last-minute canards and no4 engine impingement on take off.

Weight has ALWAYS been an issue with aircraft of all stripes, institutionally you won't find a single aero engineer comfortable with throwing mass at a problem for this reason. Double that for an aircraft lifted by it's own powerplant instead of a wing, and triple it for one that has to carry a payload at the same time!

edit: Damnit, hit SAVE too soon, meant to add: This is almost certainly behind the arrester hook geometry: the thing's a funny looking bird with very rearward undercarriage. That'll reduce the amount to play with to start with. Add to that the fact that a hook's got to attach to something strong on the airframe, and this thing is mostly composite which won't necessary carry loads the same way a gurt big aluminium spar would. It wouldn't surprise me to find that there's nothing ""structural"" much behind the main u/c, so the hook **has** to tie into that somehow.

Reread what I said: **If he was armed** and she had yelled ""Stop! I'll shoot!"" he very likely would have shot her first.

My point is, it's her fucking house... why should she hesitate to use deadly force against an intruder? Doing so only gives an intruder a greater chance of killing you or your family. If you break into my home, I'm operating under the assumption you're there to kill me and as such I'm going to do everything to maximize my chance of survival... that includes not giving verbal ""warnings"" that might give away my position or the fact that I'm armed.

&gt; One more question... birdshot is ideal to disable someone in a stressful situation like a burglary- why would you use specialist deep-penetration slugs?

No it's not. Birdshot is painful, that's it... it's not a ""body stopper"" so to speak. Somebody who is fucked up (especially on painkillers) can easily ignore a blast from birdshot and keep coming at you... slugs on the other hand will obliterate the CNS (heart, lungs, etc.) and put somebody on the ground immediately, regardless of their ability to ""tolerate"" pain. Brenneke Slugs will literally put a tennis ball sized hole in somebodies heart/lung and drop them to the ground immediately. As I said again, I'm not taking any chances. Might birdshot stop an intruder? Sure. Will slugs do a better job? You bet. I'm not at all concerned about the welfare of an intruder, I'm using the tool that maximizes *my* chance of survival not theirs.

&gt; The American idea that you can just kill someone for trespassing on 'your' land (like that actually means anything) is barbaric to me.

You're misinformed, sir. I know of only a handful of states which allow the shooting of a trespasser on land... we're talking about the ""castle doctrine"" which applies to the actual walls of your home. When you're *inside* your home you have no duty to retreat from an intruder. The idea is that every man's home is his ""castle"" which he has the inherent right to defend with whatever force he deems necessary, oddly enough these laws are actually from British common law and have been ""on the books"" since before America was even officially a country. Some say the idea of self-defense is ""barbaric"" or ""antiquated"" and no longer applies today... as if the ability to defend yourself and your loved ones is somehow less relevant in a modern society.

&gt; Wow, you're a stone-cold killer. I'm so impressed. Ever killed a man? How did that sit on your conscience? Was it worth it?

You're not really supposed to think of the Doctor as ""a man"" or ""a woman"". He's more of an archetype, a character. He's never really been outright masculine *or* feminine and that's the point.

If you suddenly and inexplicably make your lead a woman, it doesn't matter how much it makes sense in context, that's all anyone is going to notice because it's a sudden and radical change that solely draws attention to itself.

This isn't a misogynist view, either. If the show had a gender-neutrally portrayed female lead for these past fifty years I would be equally upset for the sudden casting of a man. It's a change that just reeks of being a huge gimmick. A stunt to draw in attention not for being good, but for being ridiculous.

They won't see ""the Doctor"" they'll see ""the Doctor they cast as a woman"". This has nothing to do with the underrepresentation of women in science fiction or television and has everything to do with how the Doctor's *never ever ever been a lady before*.

This sort of gender swapping is reserved for raunchy and poorly written comedies. There's no real way to make this change tastefully.

Further, I don't trust the writers to handle such a change.

Moffat's women all gravitate towards one thing and one thing alone: sex and ""badassery"". River Song when from thoughtful and mysterious archaeologist to a flirty gun-toting minx. Amy's often been blatant fanserivce and even *the TARDIS* has been made ""sexy"" under his reign. Hell, even the Widow in The Doctor, The Widow, and the Wardrobe had to start toting around a gun and having this supremely forced ""badass"" cliche painted on her.

The budget was balanced when the Tories left.  For the first 2 years of New Labour even Gordon Brown kept most of Ken Clarke's fiscal policy.  New Labour can't be blamed for the e-bubble collapse and that's where Keynesian economics come into their own.  They rightly went into deficit to correct the system.  They just never came back up.  When the budget should have been balanced around 2005-2006 Labour put the country into a death dive of spending.  When the next crisis hit they were already up to their necks in deficit.  There had been no attempt to address it.

With all their cuts the Tory-LibDem coalition is set to have reduced the deficit from £150bn to around £20bn by 2015-2016.  They'll have spent an entire term addressing nearly a decade of Labour's spend, spend, spend, and largely be unpopular because of it - but it had to be done.  The greatest crime will be if Labour gets back any time soon.

First, The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances is a two part story. As fantastic as the story and writing may be, there is always something lacking in the intensity of two part stories.
Also, The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances featured the Doctor for most of the episode. He was there to protect the people, the audience knew that some how or another he would win. Whereas  in Blink, the Doctor was absent, not because he wasn't there yet, he had encountered the angels and lost. Knowing that this fantastic man had not won against this menace created an ominous feel for the episode. If the Doctor could not win, how could Sally or anyone else?

true,OptioMkIX,null,null,"&gt;The absolute need to minimise weight and risk (and therefore novelty) to maintain a tight development schedule is the major underlying cause for all of these things, from the TSR-2's almost-exploding-turbine on first flight, through Harrier's wobbly nose gear, Concorde's last-minute canards and no4 engine impingement on take off.

The F35 is a pretty ambitious project and with hindsight should probably not have tried to cram in as many advances as it is in an airframe that small.

Going back to the weight problem, there is this buried in one of the articles:

&gt;As of November 2011, according to the report, there are only “230 pounds of margin between the current weight and the intended not-to-exceed weight of 32, 577 pounds.” However, it was recently determined that the not-to-exceed weight can be expanded by 142 pounds.

So only 370lbs or 168kg to play with out of a total of around 15.8 tonnes.

If [this](http://navy-matters.beedall.com/imagesbig/f35-cutaway.jpg) is accurate then there appears to be little in the way of strength problems although youre right in that composites are terrible in handling loads in directions other than that theyre designed for. The engine position is probably the main factor; almost every other [carrier borne aircraft has had two engines with a handy recess between them to hide a hook in.](http://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af168/Horde01/JSF%20Issues_Problems/F-35C_Hook_ImagewithFA-18.jpg)

Having said that there must be something reasonably solid at the rear of the aircraft to have [an anchor point for a tether](http://i531.photobucket.com/albums/dd356/XPLUMBER/hoverpitburner1.jpg).

I still think the idea of wanting to kill an intruder rather aim to immobilise them is the barbaric sentiment in your attitude. You seem to be salivating at thought of what brutal and decisive force you could dish out:

&gt;Brenneke Slugs will literally put a tennis ball sized hole in somebodies heart/lung and drop them to the ground immediately.

That's sounds extremely violent; have you ever done this or are you just bragging about what damage you can inflict? Have you put any deep thought into what kind of lasting mental damage that would cause you and anyone in your family who saw it?  What if it turned out to be a tragic misunderstanding but it was too late?


I would never say that *self-defense* is barbaric (and I didn't), if someone broke into my home I would obviously defend myself and so would everyone I know. 


Whatever scenario you present there could be an infinite number of solutions and outcomes, it's pointless to argue this (especially considering the differences on our nations attitudes towards lethal force).

Time Lords/Ladies, such as the Corsair, who change gender during regeneration presumably identify with both genders. Time Lords and Ladies who do not change genders during regeneration, such as the Doctor or the Master, identify with one. The Doctor views himself as male, therefore he will remain male. 

Honestly, I find the idea somewhat insulting. A female Doctor would basically be a gimmick. Especially with Moffat at the helm, I cannot foresee anything happening other than a reinforcement of gender stereotypes. I can't quite put into writing exactly why it would bother me (at least without writing a small book), but it definitely does.

If you look at neuro marketing, computers are now heavily involved in screen writing effectively and that is likely to filter through to authors too. 

I think part of the issue with the checkout aspiration is that it doesn't pay any more than benefits, which is a problem with falling wages not benefits, which to a lot of people makes no sense.

If people are empowered by seeing the direct result of their decisions I'm pretty sure more would be involved in politics. The reason everyone is so apathetic is because they have no power so why bother. 

Personally I would advocate a localised system where town hall meetings would come up with ideas based on a general consensus that are via the internet/text messaging put to the local public for a vote.

Series 1: The Unquiet Dead and Empty Child/Doctor Dances.

Series 2: Tooth and Claw, The Idot's Lantern, and The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit.

Series 4: Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead, Midnight, and Turn Left.

Between 4 and 5, there were three specials. Specials: Waters of Mars and End of Time.

They present a pretty scary ""monster"", introduce Captain Jack Harkness, bananas, but foremost the joy of the otherwise so dark 9th doctor. Although after you have seen it the first time, you know exactly what is [going on.](http://qkme.me/3ouo3i) In Blink there is mystique! Lonely assasins? As old as time? Wooow, duude. And they don't even kill you they do something much more mysterious; they let you live to death! The plot of Blink is incredibly well thought out and eventhough the plot of EC/TDD is good it progresses in a very linear fashion and does therefore not add so much to the feeling of eeriness. Whereas Blink's plot is not linear, it's more of a wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey stuff... And I think that requires a little more thinking from the writer's side. 
Furthermore I think it's scarier because there is a very real chance that you see an angel statue in the real world but a boy in a gas mask is not so usual (aroung my parts at least). Even if you would see little boys running around, the statues will be harder to figure out, since the angels are stone when you look at them and the statues you see in real life are... stone when you look at them.. well they're stone all the time, right? Or are they? The feeling of not knowing is very uneasy for me. A boy who aggressively thinks you are his mother is a little more easy spotted.

true,a1chemi5t,NP,nepal,"**19:45 GMT - Kick-off:** 

So much to play for, Messi starts the game.

**1 Minute:** 

Chelsea are playing a content game in the beginning. First foul goes to Ivanovic. Chelsea see an opportunity and show signs of a counter-attack through passes game.

**3 Minute:** 

Drogba pushes forward, but offside. Stamford Bridge is the place to be right now, you have to be here to see the fans and how they are playing alongside the starting XI.

**5 Minute:** 

Cech hoofs it forward from his own box. No flag... Looks like Drogba will sneak in as Puyol fluffs a header but his control's not very good and Victor Valdes makes a comfortable claim.
Chelsea don't want much possession tonight. 


**6 Minute:** 

Drogba pushes the defense of Barcelona again, Puyol read it well. Lovely turn by Drogba, nicking it past the over-eager Mascherano and racing past him in a flash.

**8 Minute:** 

Sanchez gets a breakthrough, defence of Chelsea nowhere to be seen at first. Cech misses it, hits the bar. Defense catches up. No goal.

**10 Minute:** 

Ivanovic lining up a long throw, Drogba target. Cahill and Terry scare Valdes and Barcelona defense. No goal, but the game is going to be fun.
Looks like a goal is coming soon.

**12 Minute:** 

Sanchez runs straight to Terry, Terry hold his ground. Sanchez not happy with Terry's challenge, Referee sees nothing wrong.

**14 Minute:** 

Barcelona passing around, their usual game. Meireles tackles Busquets, free kick given.
Cole tries to take a quick counter attack, to be denied.

**15 Minute:** 

Drogba fouled by Sergio and falls down. He is strong as usual though. Everyone moving everywhere around the field. 
Till now, a very patient but exciting game as both are trying to break through but unsuccessful. 


**17 Minute:** 

Dani Alves gets a cross from Mascherano and gives to Messi...DANGER... Chelsea respond quick.
Its not over, Fabregas goes for it and fails. Poor strike from him, but Cech is solid.

**19 Minute:** 

Long cross to Ramires, some fumble in the D-box. Long throw from Ivanovic, and the ball makes its way to Mata's left footed shot, misses it.

**20 Minute:** 

Another run from the deep from Fabregas and Cech goes up to save it! Chelsea defense being tested, but every time they're going for counter attacks.


**22 Minute:** 

Busquets-Macherano-Iniesta-Fabregas-Iniesta-....Messi-Sanchez-Messi....you know their typical build-up. Corner to Barcelona.

**23 Minute:** 

Strange corner from Barcelona, Chelsea try to take it quickly to attack back. But to be denied by the Barcelona Defense line.
Iniesta tries to create another chance forward, again, the same story of the game continues.

**25 Minute:** 

Both teams look very content with the game right now. Chelsea need to show some agression that they are lacking.
Risky challenge by Cahill to stop Iniesta in the box. Job well done.

**26 Minute:** 

Mata-Lampard-Ivanovic tries to create a chance from the right hand side but Mascherano gets the ball.
Fabregas quickly takes it and gets some room, but Cech is strong in his ground.

**28 Minute:** 

Barcelona fans are pretty loud at the bridge tonight. Barcelona start to pass around their usual game. No one apart from Drogba looks to be in the mood to attack for Chelsea.
Messi gets some room to shoot...and Cech stops. Simple shot.

**30 Minute:** 

Abramovich has an anxious smile in the VIP area. Barca involved in continuing one of their spells of suffocating dominance. Pass pass pass pass pass pass. Alves looks for Sanchez, finds him in Off-side position.

**32 Minute:** 

Messi gets a clever ball to Iniesta, Terry and Cahill are defiant. PASS pass pass pass game going on and on.


**34 Minute:** 

Alves gets a through ball, Ashley Cole and Cech were rushing towards him when Cole kicks it away. Corner kick.
Ball brought in, but Puyol fouls Drogba inside Chelsea's box. Goal kick.

**36 Minute:** 

Drogba doesn't look very sharp, and falls down again, is getting into offside positions too often.
Drogba is limping, but looks like he will recover. Some hand dressing needed for Puyol.

**38 Minute:** 

Back in action after a short injury break for Drogba &amp; Puyol to recover.
Alves fouls trying to get a through ball. 
Drogba falls down after a heavy landing, looks very painful. His fourth time tonight falling down. He doesn't look at his sharpest. Continues.

**40 Minute:** 

Cole shows some magic with his feet against Xavi. After some build up, Drogba gets a ball in a promising position but is called Off-side immediately.

**41 Minute:** 

Rain is getting a bit stronger now. Alves shoots, denied by Cole. Barcelona corner. Alves wastes the shot he got with a wild effort above the post.

**43 Minute:** 

Messi takes a ball from Mikel, moves ahead, in the box, shoots, no one but Cole is able to save it the last moment. Almost a goal from Messi.

**44 Minute:** 

Barcelona coming on strong towards the end of the first half again. Another corner for them.
Puyol involved in some pushing before the corner.
Xavi crosses the corner kick, cleared...Messi gets the ball and tries to cross it forward, only to go out.

**45 Minute:** 

Chelsea move the ball forward and Drogba is fouled by Puyol.
Another offside from Chelsea spoils the build up..
Messi shows some injury problems as he falls down, looks like he isn't in full confidence today.
And Chelsea take it forward, Ramires you are great , amazing pass to Drogba in the right hand side who calmy sweeps the ball into the net with his left foot...**GOOOOOAAAAALLLLLLLL**
Messi gave the ball away, Lampard nipped in and saw Ramires breaking away down the left. He plays a perfect pass across goal for Drogba on the far post. He shoots, it just about sneaks past Valdes and Chelsea have a lead!

**HALF TIME** 
Messi picks up a small injury, Chelsea scores with Drogba. Chelsea have now scored first in ALL 11 Champions League games this season.
Chelsea Leading Barcelona 1 - 0 at Halftime, Stamford Bridge goes crazy with celebrations!!!

**46 Minute:** 

Messi is back in the field, but you don't have to be a psychologist to see he is not confident. Lets see how long before he is taken away. RDM sits on with his palms tight. Rain is stronger than before now.
Adriano gets a throw from far left, Barcelona have possession...then suddenly a move from chelsea ahead! Throw to be done by Cole.

**48 Minute:** 

Barcelona love to play quick passes, but its raining in London. Chelsea feel at home calmly defending their pass pass pass pass pass pass pass chances away.

**49 Minute:** 

Iniesta gets a shot because of a long through ball, Ivanovic says not today mate! Corner by Messi, but nothing much available iwth the confident Chelsea defence who are holding their ground more than usual today.


**50 Minute:** 

Adriano shoots after getting a chance, routine stop for Cech standards. 
Iniesta gets a ball from Messi and tries to take it forward, Ivanovic says hello again, Goal kick.

**52 Minute:** 

Chelsea now finally get a corner, very strong from this position..calm...and three chelsea players try to head in the goal( terry, cahill and someone else), miss the ball...goes for goal kick.

**54 Minute:** 

Barcelona totally controlled the possession in the first half, but now it is changing a little bit. Barcelona are taking longer than usual to take the ball forward second half. Still, PASS PASS PASS PASS PASS PASS Messi, and then a solid stoppage from Cahill...

**56 Minute:** 

Cahill is strong again as Sanchez gets the ball for himself against Cahill and Cech only remaining. The ball dies away back to the midfield...again the passes continue.. 
Chelsea aren't minding possession at all today as Barcelona has the ball most of the time.

Barcelona had its fair share of chances but failed to capitalize, with many of their attempts getting squelched by Chelsea's great defensive play.

I really enjoyed watching the Captain Tarzan / Big Africa match-up.

true,galenwolf,eng-manchester,Manchester - FOR SCIENCE!,"Of course, this entirely depends on the governments definition of unemployment.


If, for example, to be unemployed according to the government means you have to be a ""jobseeker"" who has a current valid agreement, then all you have to do is move people into the work programme because once you do that you no longer fall under the remit of the job centre and the government can claim the number of unemployed has dropped.


Then of course, sticking people onto 8 week unpaid work can be excused because they are technically ""working"". The hilarious part of that is people don't seem to realise how bad an idea that is and some don't even care.  


Here you have large unemployed workforce which you can, by rote of the stick and no carrot, stick into 8 weeks of unpaid work (you get JSA but not NMW, yet are doing 37.5 a week which some how doesn't break any employment law O.o ) with companies that have no intention of ever taking anyone on but love the free rotating workforce that has been handed to them in a silver platter.


Of course if you asked anyone would they be willing to do 8 full weeks work for £70 a week, they'd tell you go jump off a bridge, but doing those 37.5 hours when on jobseekers, oh well thats A-ok, so much for the NMW.



Either you're doing work, or you're not. You cannot be unemployed, yet be working at tesco for 40 hours a week - thats like being dead but alive.

true,ghostridethewhip,null,null,"Every single player was fantastic. Ashley Cole is my man of the match, but you could really give it to Cech or any of the back four without any complaints from me. Goal line clearance, countless blocks, contributed hugely in the counter.

Our midfield was not exciting but so damned good today. Lampard was smooth as silk on the ball and had an unreal outlet pass to Rambo for the goal. Mikel got caught out a few times but was great help on defense and composed throughout. Meireles gets my surprise player of the match award: he was perfect on the ball through much of the game and had some great hold up play to let us get forward on the counter.

The only player who didn't really perform was Mata, but it wasn't his kind of game. He needs possession and time to create chances, and it was all defense and back and forth. Drogs was the spark and leadership we needed, in spite of all of the injury nonsense. Ramires showed that he has truly become a superstar counter attacker. He is a one man fast break every time he touches the ball.

Beautiful game guys, if a little fortunate. I'll take a fortunate 1-0 going back to the Nou Camp any day, though. Hope we can string it together for the second leg on Tuesday!

I mean, pretending to be gay was his *least* flamboyant role. 

You see, Moriarty was never about being seen, in fact he's all about *not* being seen. He was the puppetmaster, the man behind the curtain, the one working behind the shadows.

Nothing could be pinned to him because he was a master of subtlety and brilliance. The books made this abundantly clear, but it was the classic films that really explored this aspect of the character. It's a *cornerstone* element of Moriarty. While Sherlock operates in the open, Moriarty works in the shadows.

So making Moriarty the *least* subtle character makes *no sense at all*.

Moriarty isn't meant to be Sherlock's opposite, he's meant to be Sherlock in a mirror darkly. He's exactly what Sherlock would be if he used his intellect for crime and personal gain.

You think the dynamic should be order versus chaos, but that's not it at all. It's order vs. order. It's a chess game between the two, and they form each others moves as they play. If anyone of the two is the ""rule breaker"" it's Sherlock.

He was mysterious, more mysterious than any other villain in recent memory, but when they actually get to forming the man himself, they don't know what to do, so they went with camp, which doesn't fit the subtle and sinister persona *at all*.

There's a difference between ""dour"" and ""camp"". There's even a difference between ""manic"" and ""camp"". This Moriarty is nothing but camp through and through.

And I couldn't disagree more with you on your assessment of the two characters. In fact, I believe you got them *exactly* wrong.

Sherlock is a chaotic man that brings order. He keeps clues and answers to himself as he dashes about to solve a crime, often causing issue for others in doing so, but all to bring about order.

Moriarty is a man of order, he controls the criminal element of London with exact precision, and yet he does this to create chaos and obfuscation.

Posed a threat going forward, never got turned and executed a ridiculous move to make Xavi (?) look clueless. Happened right under where I sit, I want moment to replay in my dreams. Superb clearance off the line too, how many times is Cole making that game-saving interception? Bet Arsenal wish they'd offered him more than £5k a week extra, their loss has been our gain

Terry: This is the easiest one to write. Perfect. Captain, leader, legend, all were on display tonight as he ran the back line like nobody in the world can. No better defender has ever put on the shirt, I'd put this as one of his best ever performances

Cahill: The boy done good! I was discussing with my mum (part time executive, full time Barca enthusiast) if anybody has ever had such a career transformation in a season. He's gone from fighting relegation with Bolton to starting against the best in the world, doing a bloody good job at keeping them under control. He's making the step up beautifully and it's only good news for us and England

Ivanovic: Not his natural position but it never showed. Just the kind of solid, no nonsense play we need when you have Messi, Alexis et al running at you. Branna doesn't take no mess, we'll miss him against the Arse but he's the only one I'd trust to help take us in to the CL Final from RB

Mikel: Remember when he was shit? What the hell happened here? Man of the Match against a few big teams, solid in possession and Makalele-esque in his spoiling opposition attacks. This is the kid we paid £16m for. Really happy for him actually, if he continues to develop we have a nice competition with Romeu for the holding role

Lampard: Super Super Frank. Did what Xavi does, only better. Great release for our goal and the usual solid performance in the key area of the pitch. Stick that up your arse, Cesc

Mata: Looked like the walking dead, fairly anonymous performance. He's played too much football this year, often being the only one lifting us from the depths of AVB's tactics. Give him some time off during the Summer and he'll be back better than ever. Great signing and a top lad off the pitch. Hopefully he can dig deep to give us another couple of performances this season, may just help us lift the most elusive trophy

Meireles: I get pretty nervous when the tattoo aficionado starts, especially today. Didn't think he had the discipline to track back and help defend against their wide men but he came out on top. Made the right decision a couple times without executing it correctly, but I have more patience for somebody who does the right thing wrong, than the wrong thing right. Decision making is key for us as we don't create many chances and Sturridge's poor football brain has cost him a starting role as of late

Ramires: The Brazilian Kenyan does what we all hoped he would. Infinite stamina, full of effort and boy did he do most of the work for our goal. A hallmark performance for the lad and he has so much potential. Between Ramires, Luiz, Piazon and hopefully Moura we could have a strong Brazilian look to the team. Second great performance in 3 days for Rami, hope he can do it against Arsenal too

Didier: A tinge of sadness here. Most of the people I spoke to today agreed with my opinion that this would be the last time Didier Drogba graces Stamford Bridge on a European night. I doubt he'll stay, but what a send off. Vintage stuff from a Chelsea legend. Not just the goal (well taken) but a storming defensive display and great hold up play. When he wants to turn it on, nobody can defend against him. Yeah he went to ground a lot today, but no more than a few of the Barca players. Mascherano calling him a diver is like Piers Morgan calling someone a c**t

This is way too long and I had some strong verbal diarrhoea there, but what a night. I didn't enjoy the game at all and frankly spent the whole time shaking, twitching and unable to relax but we did it. If we can take out the gooners on Saturday and ride the momentum in to a positive result at the Camp Nou, we would defy everyone's expectations. Magnificent night, great to see some former Blues coming to support us too. I had a brief chat with Shevchenko before the game and he said this was the 4th game he'd been to this season, genuinely wants us to do well.

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"I said it in the IRC, I'll say it here again: We're leading at half-time. It is a good thing, yes, but we cannot rest on our laurels. Barca at Camp Nou are monsters but not unbeatable.  

I never expected Chelsea to compete for possession, passing or shots on target. There is a vast difference in the two midfields - both style and quality-wise. I was expecting the route one balls and they happened. I'm surprised Pep wasn't expecting it, to be honest. 

Kudos to the defense. Brana often strayed away from the centre but I guess it kinda helped keep the entire Barca LW in check. Kudos to Rami for his blistering run. Drogs was probably looking for payback in more ways than one, falling down Busquets-style more than once. He better stay on his feet at Camp Nou - I'm not sure the next ref is gonna be that lenient to either side. 

Mata, on the other hand, was wasted tonight. As someone pointed out, he thrives on possession and we didn't really have much of it. I guess RDM left him on the pitch to play mind-games with his Spanish team-mates. ('Will he? Won't he?') 

Expect Cuenca and/or Tello to provide width in the return leg. I think RDM should think of putting out a 4-1-2-1-2 with Torres and Drogba up top, Mata behind Torres, Lamps feeding Drogs the route one balls and helping Mikel staunch the Barca midfield. The centre of the pitch has Rami providing the incisive, pacey box-to-box runs playing slightly ahead of Lampard.

Yeah, sounds extremely ambitious but then again (IMO) the only way to beat Pep is either park the bus or catch him off-guard tactically. We've done one of them. Could we get away with doing the other? Dunno, but worth a shot, I think. 

I am not a huge fan of the 'park the bus and counterattack' style but against Barca, it makes sense. On any given day I'd prefer if Chelsea dominated possession, but on this particular day, when playing against THE team that invented this style of play, I was more than content watching Chelsea pick and choose their chances - which they did very intelligently, to boot. Had they done this against a weaker team, I'd be venting at the 'pathetic performance', to be honest. Today I'm proud, actually. 

All said and done, the game turned out almost exactly as a lot of us expected - out-passes, out-possessed and out-shot by Barca. What we certainly did not expect (we did hope, to be fair) was the result: a sweet 1-0 lead going into the second leg!

He does not create chaos, he intentionally sides with order, with those who enforce the law and bring balance and justice to criminals. He doesn't just do it for fun, he does it because when all's said and done, that's the side he stands for.

Moriarty (the real Moriarty, that is) is a cold and calculated man. Someone who has planned for and anticipated every move. He creates ordered plans and schedules for every tiny fringe of his massive empire and takes precautions to keep it hidden away.

Moriarty is *very* ordered, and yet he thrives on creating discord in the streets of London. He'll order slayings just to cause confusion and distract and introduce drugs to London just to cause weakness in the streets. He *directs* chaos in an orderly way.

Hazard is a tough call. If United, City get involved and Spurs decide to chuck some cash around, we'd be in a bidding war.

If Liverpool field SD on the left, Hendo on the right and Andy Carroll at CF, you know there's going to be some balls whipped in to Andy so the other team takes that into account and defends against it. Carroll made a name for himself scoring off his head at Newcastle and is now seen as an aerial threat and heavily defended against. Unfortunately, he also has missed several he's connected with so the conversion rate continues to drop. 

Whereas someone like Skrtel has done well this season because he is not typically known to score and has racked up something like 4-5 goals off set pieces. 

So, it CAN be a good strategy, but it really seemed forced this season. In the beginning of the season especially, we kept seeing poor balls whipped into Carroll week after week with no results. It seemed like smashing a square peg in a round hole. 

A squad really needs to be a threat in multiple ways to be effective at any of them. The opposition should have to shutdown more than 2 players to keep you from scoring goals.",0,1334789736,null,0,false,0,c4dwuwi,t3_sgr39,t1_c4dwuwi,t3_sgr39,null,1428749884,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

I remember when I was young and I noticed people staring a lot more than I do now (now I just don't pay attention). I used to say that I would rather have people ask me about it than stare. Now I sort of wish people would just stare cause I am sick of talking about it all the time with complete strangers I bump into on the street.

For example I was just watching ""The Guild"" and in one episode a character says that one of the criteria's on her ""litmus test"" for what she looks for in a man is that he has all his limbs. It was obviously just a stupid joke, but I probably hear it differently than the average person would.

Lets put it this way...outwardly I accept humour about my fake leg in the same way that lets say someone from Japan accepts jokes about '""being asian"". Life is too short to take these things too seriously. However, inwardly it is always a daily struggle to feel good about myself, to be confident, and to not let my leg get me down. I would probably be a good sport about jokes, but at the end of the day, it really only doesn't ""hurt"" when I am the one making the jokes.",0,1334791326,null,0,true,0,c4dx7k6,t3_sfpv0,t1_c4dx7k6,t1_c4dsjsd,null,1428750041,2,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,2

As long as the actor is good, and that goes without saying.

The hard part would be handling it. Would it be part of a plot, would it be out of nowhere?

And handling the character would be important. Don't make her some kind of hypersexed innuendo machine, but don't go the opposite extreme and end up with a matron mother. For some reason, it's harder to make a likable female character on tv, and I believe it's because a female character's sexuality is tied closer to the character than with males. And that just sucks, thanks western society.

Anywho, it would be a risky move. Plus, it would just seem so odd. The Doctor seems to be 'mentally male'. Just as some transgendered people feel they're female inside or something, the Doctor has gone for 11 male incarnations in a row. It would be out of character.

Whereas, if we had a Time Lord who just liked to switch genders every other regeneration, that would seem more consistent. Like the Corsair.

Personally, I find the man who appears to be flailing randomly but is actually plotting every move *much* more interesting than the man who really is just flailing randomly.

And besides that character, the character who really does just make wild actions, *isn't Moriarty*. It's not the foil for Sherlock.

Sherlock faces total chaos in virtually every single case. Sudden killings, fast robberies, Sherlock finds one-shot unplanned crime all over the place. The point of Moriarty is that *nothing* is left to chance. *Everything* is calculated.

Sherlock picks up on every criminals mistakes, and the point of Moriarty is that *he never makes mistakes*. That's really the point of him, that he can see all the little details Sherlock can, but he knows how to hide himself, to subtly cloak himself in shadow and deception and make every move with the intricacy of never leaving a single trace.

Moriarty didn't turn his attention to Sherlock until Sherlock started poking around. And he didn't immediately start the mind games. He wore Sherlock out, kept him on the run, had men follow him wherever he went and ransacking his room.

true,alexcity,CupFinalsCrest,,"No worries comrade! 'The blues' is fine, though most people just say 'city'. Fixtures are indeed arranged matches, a fixture list is the schedule of matches in a season, the 'fifa fair play' (FFP) is essentially a scheme introduced by FIFA to attempt to regulate the exorbitant amounts of money circulating in football, note that money wasn't a problem when it was only the big clubs (Manchester United, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid) who had it, but now smaller clubs like City are getting in on the act, they've decided enough is enough! To comply with the ruling City need to increase revenue through sponsorship, prize money, tv money etc. and reduce spending on players wages, transfer fees etc. to a point where they are operating within their means, however, if we show we are moving in the right direction, this shouldnt be a problem!

As for the uniform, they tend to either be called shirts (in particular reference to the top), kits or strips (in reference to shirts, shorts and socks) though kit is probably the default wording.

Hope this helped, a quick google on FFP will tell you more than I can, and the brilliant blog 'Swiss Ramble' will tell you more than you can comprehend regarding finance in football, there are some excellent articles in there about City and how they might respond to FFP.

He's changed hair color, eye color, height, weight the color of his skin seems to be a standard change (it's not like every Doctor's been the exact same shade of pale) that has it's precedent.

Race is really founded in nationality and cultural heritage, something that wouldn't be brought up with the Doctor (he's still Galifreyan, no matter what his skin color is). There really would be no need for drama, unlike with gender which would have to be addressed (his companions know that he will change pretty much everything about his appearance, but *none* of them know whether he can become a woman).

A major part of The Christmas Invasion was underscoring that the Tenth Doctor was ""the same man"" as the Ninth Doctor. They had the same friends, shared the same senses of humor. A lot of that episode was to make people understand (with difficulty) that this man *is the same man*.

This is going to be *vastly* difficult when the Doctor *literally* is not the man we initially met.

I agree with Rebelcat in that respect, but I am saying that the issue is not necessarily with turning *female* so much as it is suddenly changing genders.

I think society's gender roles are a byproduct of our collective pasts, and is something we've been slowly sloughing off for years.

Literally nothing.

Rory's got a role on the show, that of the trustworthy husband. And he's done *a lot* to show that he *is* that good person.

But race is not just founded in nationality and cultural heritage because I'm culturally American (grew up in the US, am a citizen) yet I'm still racially Chinese. A 'color-change' would be just as unprecedented as a 'gender change'. Plus, you can be a woman and British. There's no threat to cultural heritage.

And while a gender change would be more alarming to companions than a color change, that doesn't mean it shouldn't be attempted. Plus you could just change companions anyways so that's not even an issue.

I'm pretty sure that the very first regeneration was jarring... If it had been established early on that the Doctor could change genders, then this wouldn't be a problem. But if it's considered too drastic a change now, there's no way it was going to happen back then.

This is all opinion anyways. It's your opinion that a gender change is too drastic in comparison to a color change to be acceptable, and it's my opinion that it's not too drastic to be acceptable. Either way it's an unnecessary risk the BBC will never take.",0,1334800552,null,0,false,0,c4dz6xo,t3_rw5e6,t1_c4dz6xo,t1_c4dxr7k,null,1428751050,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"The Doctor claimed that the Corsair was a she more than once, but the only hint we get of the Doctor worrying about himself turning into a woman is when he's so delirious he doesn't know who he is and is marveling at the amount of fingers he has. If he was judging his gender based on his (admittedly moderate, he had more hair when he was Three, Four, Six, and One, and possibly others if I measured out) hair-length he probably was just randomly panicking.

And in the way he was panicking it was as if it was something wholly unexpected, as if he didn't expect himself to become a girl *at all*. It really does seem that this remark was made in a delirious panic and not an actual posit of a possible regenerative outcome.

In The Sarah Jane Adventures however he is specifically asked if he would always be white, to which he replies that he could be anything. That's a deliberate answer given in a sobered state of mind. Very different.

The point I was making was that the Doctor has already changed all his features. He's already changed the colors of all sorts of attributes, so the color of his skin seems like an insignificant change.

I mean really, racism is one of the major blights of the world that has (arguably) most died out. It's not just equal rights, but growing equal representation in media and equal social acceptance and integration.

Directly because of Britain's hyperdiversity, race in the U.K. is a missive mish-mash of different peoples. Here in America you might be able to go weeks without seeing someone of different ethnicity (particularly in some southern areas, but surprisingly this is most common in the rural north). In virtually any major area on the island, you'll see a menagerie of different ethnicities. This plays a huge role in how race is seen by British media, based on the statistics of whose watching and what viewer want to see.

There actually was a campaign from I believe one of the co-creators of the show for the Doctor to become female during their ratings crisis in the mid-Eighties. Had Doctor Who decided to take that dip and choose to redefine themselves with it, I think the change would have gone over better, as it was an attempt to revitalize (although I admit, such a change could easily be seen as gimmicky).

Point being that Doctor Who is a success now. It's gotten it's fame, and that fame is steadily growing thanks in large part to simulcasting in America and support by Netflix. A sudden change now risks alienating all that. Had such a change been made when there was nothing to lose and everything to gain, I could understand that, but now the concept of the Doctor played by a male is backed by too much precedent and solidified through success to be abandoned now.

The BBC actually *did* consider an African-American Doctor for the Eleventh. The brilliant Chiwetel Ejiofor (known for his role on Serenity as the Operative and his *brilliant* Shakespearean stage work) would have been the Eleventh Doctor, had it not been for Smith winning out (among other contestants for the spot).

&gt;racism is one of the major blights of the world that has (arguably) most died out

Glad you added that arguably in there because that's crazy. Racism is sooo still here. Not even close. Why would people have called to see Obama's birth certificate? It may not seem like there's racism in GDCs (greater developed countries) or in middle class suburbia but that's crazy. I live in a GDC super-white upper middle class suburbia but there are still Hispanics, African Americans, Asians (me), etc. in my classes. Going *weeks* without seeing non-white people is a big exaggeration. Whether or not we've got a legacy for treating immigrants like crap (and we do), America still is and has been a very diverse place, just not an equal one.

I think that the 80s attempt at a genderbend would've gone very badly. Ratings were down so they were turning to crazy schemes to boost ratings- that is gimmicky.
