I've been with VM since they were still Telewest - the customer service is appalling, but I've only had to interact with 'em a handful of times, typically when changing services.

They apply traffic management / packet shaping, and there's a usage limit imposed during most of the day - i.e. download more than X number of GBs and your speed is restricted for a number of hours, but I think I've only exceeded it once or twice.

Personally I've got no real complaints - bar the fact that despite my telling their customer service staff umpteen times that I don't own a TV, they keep trying to get me to sign up for their HD TV service.

What calling is it that draws a person to private security work? I don't mean to denigrate the profession, but what ideals and responsibilities attach to it? Policing when controlled by private firms will go from being a calling and a public duty to being simple menial labour, and the consequences at street level will be legion.

I know what the military is like and it just doesn't take into account pension dates and that sort of thing when it comes to redundancies, if anything that is why it's getting slated in the Telegraph, because it didn't take that into account. 

Bad publicity is something those who run the armed forces really hate, but if they did start looking at people's end dates rather than making the decisions based upon what they believe is best for the army, then that would be unfair to others and wrong, because people would be getting special treatment purely based upon the bosses not wanting bad publicity and end dates, whereas the decisions have to be made with the future of the armed forces in mind. 

Don't get me wrong, I expect they've got a lot of things wrong with their planning etc, however with this, I can't see how else they could have handled it.

true,Morinaka,null,null,"&gt;G4S run prisons, can you see a conflict of interest there?

Of course, but i assume you are worried about lobbying for laws to generate more prisoners? Seems the ultimate problem there is government corruption and cronyism not G4S themselves, in the current system any other company would do the same. If the government gives a monopoly to G4S then it seems the other option is to open it up to more businesses to keep them in check.

&gt;G4S is a private organisation, accountable to shareholders first and foremost.

Who are the current police accountable to? It sure isn't the public, and i hope you aren't naive enough to think they are because they are paid with taxes. Nearly any business is more accountable than a government organization by the very fact that you can stop using it and convince others to, you can't really stop paying taxes because you don't like a government service, unless you like going to jail for not paying tax.

The problem is we don't do privatization properly, if you are going to do it then go the whole hog and make them accountable to consumers who can exercise choice, not the current way of giving a monopoly to a government favoured company paid or subsidized with tax money, when you have a guaranteed income, know you can't fail and have no competitors then there's no incentive to provide a good service.

Private monopolies are bad which ever way you look at it, and that's what it will end up being 2 or 3 corporations owning all of our police force and cartel building. The Police force fill a very special role, and need to remain independent as possible.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Is it immoral to pay as little tax as possible?

There is a difference between trying to minimise your tax bills by using measures that the government has explicitly put in place for social/policy reasons (like writing off genuine business expenses and putting money in a pension) versus gaming the system to manifestly pay less tax than you ought.

&gt;  The British government brings in £592 billion. What Jimmy Carr pays in tax isn't going to affect anyone's world.

If everyone did this then the government would bring in considerably less. No more NHS, no more armed forces, police, unemployment benefits. Everyone has a moral duty to pay their fair share.

&gt; Is David Coulthard immoral because he moved to Monaco to avoid paying any tax whatsoever?

[Straw man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man) logical fallacy. Answer is irrelevant to the question at hand. Whether moving out of the country altogether is immoral is very different question to whether doing a Jimmy Carr is immoral.

&gt; The PM coming out to call Carr immoral is a joke given the behaviour of MPs in recent years. Cameron is just trying to score points and gain popularity by attacking a celebrity.

That's an [ad hominem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem) logical fallacy. Just because the PM is immoral doesn't mean he is wrong when he says that Jimmy Carr is immoral. The fact that he's after votes (ie the mechanism by which democratic accountability works) is neither here nor there when it comes to judging whether what he said is true.

I'll add this - we all get outraged when a benefit cheat bilks the taxpayer out of £20,000 a year. Jimmy Carr has apparently deprived the taxpayer of £3.3 million, which is a sum 165 times larger.

If these measures were explicitly put in place for social/policy reasons then surely it would have made sense to explicitly prevent rich individuals from using it. It sounds like a glaring omission to me. As Jimmy Carr has said, he pays no more than he has to. The government cannot implement flawed legislation then blame rich/smart taxpayers for using perfectly legal loopholes.

&gt; We all get outraged when a benefit cheat bilks the taxpayer out of £20,000 a year. Jimmy Carr has apparently deprived the taxpayer of £3.3 million, which is a sum 165 times larger.

HMS Ark Royal and HMS Invinicible were decommissioned in 2011 and 2005 respectively.

There is no replacement carrier expected until 2016, leaving the UK without *any* aircraft carriers for those two years. This will make defending the Falklands without allied support extremely difficult.

The Harrier was retired in 2010, and its replacement, the F-35 Lightning II, still in development and plagued with problems.

False assumption 1 - I've written plenty of code. There's just no point selling it. It's either far too niche to make money (like programming utilities - e.g. I've written some code generators for my own use), or it would be in competition with free stuff that everyone knows about that's developed by dozens or hundreds of people, and in any case I need more skills than just programming anyway, as I keep saying.

[As to how much you make? If your games good you'll earn the $20 it cost to put the app in the market back.](http://androidforums.com/android-applications/236743-how-much-will-i-get-android-market.html)

To make your $20 fee back, your *game* must be *good*. Writing a game mostly isn't about programming - it's about game design, graphics, animation, music. AND all the skills needed to get noticed in a huge crowd.

&gt; If the authors of Angry Birds took your view, their odds of writing Angry Birds would be zero.

The authors of Angry Birds *did* take my view. That's why they were successful. The company started with three people with a lot of business sense. They had a lot more by the time they received the idea for Angry Birds from a games designer. That games designer presented them with pictures - graphical designs for characters, basically. He wasn't a programmer, and personally I wouldn't even call him a games designer (at least based on that) as there was *no* game logic in the idea. [The initial cost to develop Angry Birds was estimated to exceed €100,000, not including money spent on the subsequent updates.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angry_Birds#Development).

Angry birds is a casual game, but don't let that fool you about the work involved.

&gt; This is an opportunity for you to do something that will keep you active and keep you going.

I'm still mentally active.

Think about it. I'm unemployed. I don't have a TV because a TV license costs money. I don't play computer games much for various reasons, costs of consoles and games included but probably not the top ones. I see people long enough to talk to maybe once or twice a week, for maybe a couple of hours at a time. I enjoy reading, but there's only a couple of authors that I follow, each only releasing maybe one book per year.

And for the on-the-internet-all-the-time-theory... I'm one of those people who keeps screaming and shouting every time something assumes that I'll have an internet connection all the time. Sure, I'll go on the internet for anything from a few minutes to a couple of hours at a time. On average, though, for no more than about an hour a day. You can only look at so many cat pictures.

Anyway, the internet has always been a means to an end for me. I use it to get the information I want, then odds are I switch it off. I dual boot on my desktop machine (Windows 7 and XP), and XP (which I use a *lot*) has the ethernet driver permanently disabled because that way I don't need security software, which means software runs around 10 times faster than on Windows 7 which has antivirus, firewall etc.

I have an ancient laptop that I also use a lot, also Windows XP, which hasn't been connected to the internet for at least 5 years.

So - that's a lot of time to fill.

The trouble is that popular view that unemployed people spend all their time getting drunk, watching TV, playing games, going to pubs etc. *NONE* of that is real.

What I spend my day doing is mostly programming, or learning about programming, or learning new programming tools. That is my Aspergers ""special interest"" if you want to put it in those terms. You might call it my [displacement activity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_activity) - what I do because I want the social isolation and sensory deprivation to end, but I know the consequences.

If you can't accept that running a software business requires business skills, you should at least understand that writing a game requires more than code - graphics, animation, music, sound effects - even ignoring the issue a game design and that when people don't have the skills to do that themselves, they have to find others who *can* do it, either recruiting more people to the team or buying in those assets.

If you need a special reason why a person with Aspergers shouldn't be expected to have the creative skills of a whole team of normal people, consider this - [It is a gross misconception that people with Aspergers have no imagination. ... Psychologists who have observed kids with AS have labeled them as unimaginative, simply because they were not playing as society expects to see children play and have subsequently misunderstood what they've observed.](http://www.autismsupportnetwork.com/news/autism-aspergers-and-imagination-399902883). That's a carefully chosen link. Sure, I have imagination and creativity - but there *is* an issue. Enough of an issue that thousands of experts simply assume that imagination and creativity don't exist in autism and aspergers.

Themed bingo cards? That's not a programming challenge. The problem is having the idea, getting noticed, and maintaining the business when everyone else who was stumped for an idea has written a clone.

There must be something like 100 levels in a game like Angry Birds, maybe more. They look visually simple, but it's like the difference between reading a presentation and writing and preparing it - each of those levels involves the work of several people and took hours or days to design. And those people were skilled at jobs that have nothing to do with programming.

I am not an artist or an animator. I used to write tracker music (and developed around a dozen effects and synthesizer plugins for Jeskola Buzz a bit more than ten years ago because of that) but the music I enjoy isn't the music that other people enjoy. Designing puzzles like those in angry birds in a way that others will enjoy them, even for 2 minutes at a time? It's just not something I can do. I *have* developed games (every programmer probably does at some point), but even I hate them. Programming them was about the programming, not about the game.",0,1340236388,null,0,1340238717,0,c53c8rp,t3_v8eap,t1_c53c8rp,t1_c532k3b,null,1429190744,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;less-academic pupils will sit a different exam

Oh god the return of the ""academic"" ""non-academic"" binary is finally here. While every child is different, and we should not have a one size fits all approach, dividing up children on this basis is a dangerously stupid dogma.

Ken Robinson sums up why in a lecture of education popularised by RSAnimate serise on youtube (really worth checking out if you havn't heard of them).

&gt;So there was also built into it [universal education] a whole series of assumptions about social structuring capacity. It was driven by an economic imperative of the time, but running right through it, was an intellectual model of the mind, which was essentially the Enlightenment view of intelligence. That real intelligence consisted in this capacity for certain type of deductive reasoning, and a knowledge of the Classics originally, what we've come to think of as academic ability.

&gt;And this is deep in the gene pool of public education. There are really two types of people. Academic and non academic. Smart people and non smart people. And the consequence of that is that many brilliant people think they are not, because they've been judged against this particular view of the mind. So we have twin pillars, economic and intellectual. And my view is that this model has caused chaos in many people's lives. And it's been great for some - there've been people who benefited wonderfully from it, but most people have not.

Of course I might have a little banter with Evertonian friends, but that is all it is, banter and nothing that gets angry or out of hand.

I personally find it a little baffling. Two teams from the same city. Why do I have to hate one if I love the other?
Why do people get so angry and bitter towards the other over a game?

It's a gamble - the number of times they get caught out is worth it for the money they make off people looking for highlighted labels, hunting for a discounts.

Supermarkets research buyer psychology: 

As a hunter/gatherer, people will auto focus on the high profile labelling for the best deal, also called 'display'. It's an advertising term.

Display: Big, eye catching yellow labels for the real discounts (low profit margin products like vegetables, rice) in the same way as false discounts (high profit margin products like alcohol).

Use yellow for the label as it catches the eye. (Red is too stressful, blue &amp; green too passive - yellow is the Goldilocks point: right in between. Just like amber at traffic lights, except the colour amber doesn't look right under artificial lighting).

So, people hunt for bargains, things they need &amp; things they wouldn't normally buy - see the yellow label, associate it with bargain, and in their hurry, they don't read the small print - they focus on the yellow label, don't see the price, small print, mind tricks them into believing they've got a bargain.

It's not illegal - there is no lie: 1 for £2, **2 for £4.50**

And in their hurry to get out of the horrible, nasty shopping experience, people go from one yellow label to the next.

Over the past 20 years education spending is up, more people are staying in education for longer and HE is more open and there is more support in the forms of past papers. mocks and specialist support, as I said, exams in the past were not good hard or challenging, they were so badly written by people who did not have a clue what they were doing half the time, now they are written by professional teams and marked strickly on a pre written scheme and are regulated heavily. You are never expected to go into an exam with out prior revision, 20-30 years ago, many were not told of an exam until the week before. The past was a fault here, more people passing is a sign things are working well, it does not devalue degrees or academia, it shows after decades of elitism and snobbery dressed with over challenging exams things a fairer and more accessable. The education minister who was educated at a public school, not a state school whishes to change it to a set of values he has been told are correct, dispite him never wittnessing them in action. More people are in education hence more passes, do not ruin future generations chances of a good and fair non elitest education becasue you feel threatend by numbers devaluing your achievements. We should be celebrating this increase, not restricting it. Im sure many older people will claim your work in education was too easy, as would their elders to their education. I can say with out doubt when I did my GCSE's they were tough enough and I encourage any person who doubts the integrity of GSCE's or any exam to sit one in a subject they are not strong in, and come back and using only the resources available to a GCSE student and claim it was not difficult, may who attack exams for being to soft haven't taken one in decades. A rise over 24 years shows value and significance we are getting as a nation more educated, and we should stop trying to beat down those in education, because if we tighten the exam system up, untold damage would be caused.

&gt; With the NHS I feel its definitely the responability of the government to restrict harmful drug use that will cost everybody money and cause people serious harm, socially, mentally, physically, and financially

How about smoking? It's in the public interest for people to keep doing it. In 2010, tobacco tax revenue was about £10.5bn. The direct cost to the taxpayer was around £8.35bn. This is according to this [ash leaflet](http://ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_121.pdf).

There's an interesting problem though; what about heroin? That stuff's dangerous, but if people want it you need to get it to them more easily than the black market can, otherwise the risk to their health is higher (second hand syringes, poisonous adulterants). At the same time you don't want to inadvertently make it available to people without making sure they're going to be able to get treatment for addiction to it.

It's not an easy problem to solve, but I personally think cutting the black market out of all recreational drug sales should be looked at - whether the trade off between fewer poisonings and higher addiction rates is worth it would be interesting to find out.

Secondly, while exam results are showing unabated year on year improvements, at the same time there has been a rise in employers complaining about standards to which young prospective employees have been educated to, especially when it comes to basic literary and numeracy. So these two positions cannot both be correct, either our education system has failed to do anything other than master teaching to the test (which was an issue with my schooling over a decade ago, especially with younger teachers), or the expectations that businesses have of their young employees has suddenly risen to questionable levels. I suspect the former myself.

Producing an educated workforce is imperative, without it our nation will find it far harder to compete in a global market, And unfortunately, despite ever rising internal indicators, our students are not receiving the type of education they will need to succeed, they are not being taught by the right people and the system as a whole is not funded properly.

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"I disagree. I'd say Spearing was far from a solid back up last season. Off the top of my head, I can think of 3 games where Spearing performing very badly (not just an off day, but significantly poorly) played a big part in us losing the game - Fulham away (red card for an unnecessary challenge that left us down to 10 men when we'd been dominating), Man United away (their midfield basically passed around Spearing like he was a training cone), and Chelsea at Wembley (conceded possession for both goals).

In contrast, Spearing's most impressive displays have come when he's allowed to play box-to-box, e.g. under Kenny in 2010-11 when he played next to Lucas, or games like the Arsenal game at Anfield where it was a two-man midfield without one designated holding player. He's a (very) poor man's Gerrard rather than a Lucas-style player.

Our second half of the season isn't Spearing's fault, but the absence of Lucas or a similar player to Lucas was a big problem.

On the other hand, I don't think we need to focus on a creative midfielder. We have Gerrard, Sigurrdson is probably coming in for less than 10m, and Adam (you can criticise him all you want, but he *does* create). This is all assuming Aquilani leaves, otherwise you now have another very creative player. But once Lucas is injured, the next best defensive player we have is Gerrard, and it's unacceptable to be forced to play him like that again - I don't care how well he's doing it for England, Liverpool can't play two banks of four and sit back in the league.",0,1340247346,null,0,false,0,c53erlf,t3_vbroc,t1_c53erlf,t1_c535mli,null,1429191963,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Didn't like: Ep. 1 ""Rose"" and all the earlier series 1 episodes. She seemed whiny, selfish, and directionless, and she treated Mickey like dirt.

Really liked: Then the last few episodes of series 1, she comes into her own, and the Bad Wolf bit was fantastic.

Didn't like: She was kind of ""eh"" with Tennant. With Eccleston, I felt like both characters were equally contributing to the relationship. With Tennant, I realized I cared for her because *he* cared for her. All of the on-screen relationship was one-sided in a way (and I know that doesn't quite make sense, but I'm talking feelings here, not logic). She didn't give me much to love about her, but Tennant made me like her character more than I thought I did.

Loved her: End of series 2. Really stellar acting on Billie's part, and she finally hit her stride with her chemistry with the Doctor.

Missed her: I didn't expect to miss Rose...but I did. Partly because the Doctor missed her, too.

true,5uare2,lfc68,,"Good point about trying to get someone who can play both the DM and box-to-box roles, and having the option of a defensive double pivot in midfield. I agree about the backup not being sub-par; Lucas' position is far too important for that, and Spearing already provides a sub-par backup for that role if we want it (I'm not hating on Spearing before anyone claims that, just saying that he's sub-par in Lucas' role). Good point about suspensions, as well - Lucas got himself a one-game suspension for yellow cards against Norwich, less than 10 fixtures into the season.

While I'm down here, I'll give my thoughts on the names you suggested.

**Faurlin:** Agreed that he's QPR's best player. That's why I'm not sure they'll let him go cheap; he's on contract for the next 3 seasons. Also, risky to buy a backup coming back from a cruciate ligament injury when our first-choice is doing the same.

**Bradley:** Two years left on his contract, young player, coming from mid-table in Serie A: wouldn't be a bad choice at all; you're right about his passing, though - doesn't he try go for the hollywood pass? He's said [he'd like to stay in Italy](http://www.nesn.com/2012/05/michael-bradley-is-in-love-with-serie-a-but-hell-consider-leaving-chievo-verona-in-summer.html), and apparently Roma and Napoli are interested.

**Nainggolan:** A little costly is an understatement :P He's still got 3 years on his deal, won't come cheap at all. A guy like Nainggolan's probably too good to be a backup, I'd argue, but it helps that he can play the box-to-box role as well. But he is a very tidy passer of the ball. 

**Medel:** Sevilla are in need of money, too. Apparently Real Madrid are interested (trust them to want the dirty player who handled Messi), but that could just be transfer rumour fancy. Problem is, I don't see him wanting to play backup.

**Kvist:** Oooh, I like him. Again, would he play backup? Most 27 year olds prefer the pitch to the bench, I've heard. Won't come cheap, either.

What about stealing from some recently relegated clubs? I really like Bruno from Villareal - very Makelele-esque, although he's contracted till 2016 I think. A poorer man's option might be N'Zonzi at Blackburn, he was linked away from the club in the last window as well.

true,TheMidnighToker,null,null,"Tea

One or two Americans have asked me why the English like tea so much, which never seems to them to be a very good drink. To understand, you have to make it properly.

There is a very simple principle to the making of tea, and it’s this—to get the proper flavour of tea, the water has to be boilING (Not boilED) when it hits the tea leaves. If it’s merely hot, then the tea will be insipid. That’s why we English have these odd rituals, such as warming the teapot first (so as no to cause the boiling water to cool down too fast as it hits the pot). And that’s why American habit of bringing a teacup, a tea bag, and a pot of hot water to the table is merely the perfect way of making a tin, pale, watery cup of tea that nobody in their right mind would want to drink. The Americans are all mystified about why the English make such a big thing out of tea because most Americans HAVE NEVER HAD A GOOD CUP OF TEA. That’s why they don’t understand. In fact, the truth of the matter is that most English people don’t know how to make tea anymore either, and most people drink cheap instant coffee instead, which is a pity, and gives Americans the impression that the English are just generally clueless about hot stimulants.

So the best advice I can give to an American arriving in England is this: Go to Marks and Spencer and buy a packet of Earl Grey tea. Go back to where you’re staying and boil a kettle of water. While it is coming to the boil, open the sealed packet and sniff. Careful---you may feel a bit dizzy, but this is in fact perfectly legal. When the kettle has boiled, pour a little of it into a teapot, swirl it around, and tip it out again. Put a couple (or three, depending on the size of the pot) of tea bags into the pot. (If I was really trying to lead you into the paths of righteousness, I would tell you to use free leaves rather than bags, but let’s just take this in easy stages.) Bring the kettle back up to the boil, and then pour the boiling water as quickly as you can into the pot. Let is stand for two or three minutes, and then pour it into a cup. Some people will tell you that you shouldn’t have milk with Earl Grey, just a slice of lemon. Screw them. I like it with milk. If you think you will like it with milk, then it’s probably best to put some milk into the bottom of the cup before you pour in the tea. If you pour milk into a cup of hot tea, you will scald the milk. If you think you will prefer it with a slice of lemon, then, well, add a slice of lemon.

Drink it. After a few moments you will begin to think that the place you’ve come to isn’t maybe quite so strange and crazy after all.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"Again, I don't like the idea of calling it a back-up. There should not be any guarantee of a first-team place for anyone. Players need to constantly prove that they deserve to start, and nothing is better for that than competition. If one of these players come in and plays better than Lucas, I'd bench Lucas in an instant. If Gylfi comes in and plays better than Gerrard, I'd bench Stevie too. 

The players listed all fulfilled some criteria for me. They have good stats defensively in making tackles, good stats in passing, and a relatively clean injury record. Also, they all come from clubs that are lower in the hierarchy compared to Liverpool, and will not be playing Champions League football next season. This means that in terms of football, prestige and money, we are in a position of strength. 

For Faurlin, having 2 players returning from injury in the same position isn't necessarily a bad thing, it allows us to ease both into match fitness slowly. A 60 minute match for one, with the other subbed in for 30 minutes. Rotate accordingly. Garnish to serve. When I said cheap, I meant 10 million cheap. 

Bradley says that he likes to stay in Italy, but that might be a way of marketing himself to the two clubs rumoured to be in for him, than a way of rejecting a move overseas. Also, he's had a history of leaving a league after 2-3 years, so I don't think he would mind relocating too much. Coming to Liverpool, a club that has a strong following in the US thanks to the FSG, would propel his star upwards. He is also available for around 5 million. Anyway, if Napoli goes for him, then I'd happily take Gargano off their hands.

Nainggolan will cost upwards of 15 million, but he is a fucking gem and whoever doesn't pry him from Cagliari now will have to stare at a minimum of 20 million in a couple of years time when every other club in the world are in for him. 

Medel has been linked with Liverpool for about 3 years now. He doesn't need to play back-up, he can play the defensive role and let Lucas transition to a distribution role (few remember that Lucas is actually pretty good on the ball). Today's football no longer relies on a specialist in the defensive midfield role, the defensive midfielder must be able to play as the pivot from time to time. Khedira and Busquets are both equally adept at distribution as they are at tackling. I really like Medel, because he's a fighter and a pitbull and I love the dirty South American way, but he is likely to be too divisive for us, especially when we already have Suarez. 

Kvist might prefer the pitch to the bench, but at 27, this might be his last chance to play in a big club. But he is the least likely of the lot, since he just joined Stuttgart last year. I only put him in here 'cos I like him. 

Bruno will be good for cheap since the Yellow Submarine has sunk, and easily a competitor for the players I listed above. However, I would still prefer getting younger players like Faurlin, Bradley or Nainggolan so we don't have to find another DM 3 years down the road.

Nainggolan's a gem, but this window at least our (limited) funds might be better spent elsewhere, i.e. on the right wing; hence, try to find a cheaper option for the middle. Besides, it looks like Juventus are currently after him.

Nothing more to say about Medel and Kvist.

I disagree about needing the guy to be younger - Bruno's 28, so I'd say he's still good for at least 2-3 seasons before physical decline becomes a significant concern.

true,schmandarinorange,smith,Smith,"&gt;His entire life was goofy

The more I think about it, emotional scenes are only right for Matt Smith if the pieces are set up properly. Otherwise, he's, well, goofy. And that would be a great theme for a regeneration, especially for Smith. Other regenerations have been about the melancholy of the overall situation. The Doctor is essentially dying, and leaving his companions. In the past (especially with Tennant) these heavy-hearted goodbyes have been what worked and made these regenerations so memorable. Smith would be a perfect chance for Moffat to try something new, though. The End of Time was definitely dramatic, and it succeeded in its goal of showing the pain and sadness of Tennant's separation from his companions, and personally, I don't think it could be topped in terms of emotion. Plus, I think people would want to see Smith go in a happy way. 

I also love your idea for the regeneration. The one thing I think it needs, though, is one of Smith's signature monologues.

true,dangercart,lfc68,,"Ok, first off I'm sorry to hear about your financial difficulties.  I honestly mean that even though I'm about to say stuff that seems to go against that.  I also realize that between the cost of the shirt and framing you probably aren't making too much off this.

However, this kind of bothers me for a few reasons.

1.  I just don't want to come here and see classified ads.  It's just annoying.
2.  You've had this for less than six months.  I'm trying not to automatically be negative about this but it does set off my bullshit radar when I see someone selling one of their ""great possessions"" that they got a couple of months ago.  It appears to still be in shrink wrap which makes me think you just had it framed (or at least never on your wall), too, so this all looks like a professional sale.  Within six months you got it certified, mounted with ticket and framed and now you're looking to sell it because of financial hardship?
3.  This is why athletes don't like signing autographs.  They all talk about how they get hassled in public or take the time to sign after matches and HATE knowing that some of that stuff is just going to end up being sold or auctioned off.
4.  Someone is going to buy a shirt that says ""I was there"" even though they may not have been with a ticket stub for a seat they didn't sit in, which is odd.

Sorry if this hurts your ability to sell it if everything really is legitimate and as you say but that's how I felt when I saw this post.",0,1340257190,null,0,1340268207,0,c53h0df,t3_vcp8g,t1_c53h0df,t3_vcp8g,null,1429192999,16,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,16

The system is ok as it is, there is a lot of discussion about it being too easy or too hard, given that many of the subjects have higher and foundation papers, that already accommodates pupils of differing academic abilities. I am quite impressed how they teach science at my sons school now, instead of the integrated rubbish they have reverted back to teaching it as 3 separate subjects, with the option at the end to take 3 papers if you are on a higher level, 2 papers for a middle level and a general integrated paper for the lower level. In addition they are teaching the 21st century science syllabus, which is far more relevant to what these kids will need to know if they study science at a higher level. Intelligence comes in many forms, my boy is predicted to get A*/A's and B's in all his exams, however he did fall for the 'gullible has been taken out of the dictionary' line the other day! :-) 

It should not be about making exams harder, not at GCSE level anyway, those who are brighter will go on and sit A levels or do Diplomas because they have the grades and ability needed.

true,Morinaka,null,null,"&gt;I just dont believe private companies can ever be incentivised to promote community, to get to know the problem kids before they are prolific criminals.

I wasn't aware this was the job of a law enforcement officer, nor should it be really, a sense of community comes from the community not the police in it, i'm curious to know in what way you think they promote community? Problem kids usually get shoved off on to social services or slapped with asbo's, problem kids usually come from problem homes and the police can't and won't fix that.

&gt;the best you can hope for from this economics lead theory is that it will drive costs down, invariably quality of the delivery will fall along with it. After all the 'customers' with a complaint are in a group who are always going to be complaining. 

If your current police service can't provide the level of quality you want then you use another one, if they can provide the level of quality you want cheaper than the current police force then that's not really a problem to me.  
It wouldn't be hard to make the force cheaper to run by simply not enforcing so many of those laws that lock up or fine people for pointless crimes. I'd also wager that people would be better armed for personal defense, whether that's a good thing or not i can't say.  
I mean really how often do you use the police, the only things i can think of that i'd want help from the police for are when someone is using aggressive force against me or my property, such as theft, any physical violence, trespassing, fraud etc. and those things are usually fairly rare for most people.

Complaining is what keeps things in check, reputation is important, who can you complain about the police to if you are treated unfairly by the police? the police themselves? If you don't like a company and you complain about it to them they can take you seriously or ignore you, if they brush you off you tend to avoid them, and tell other people to avoid them, can't really do that with an organization that has a monopoly on the use of force though.

Though really this is all just talk as any ""privatization"" of the force will be done poorly by the government as they'll be paid with public money but not accountable to the public and not subject to economic forces like a normal business.",0,1340264908,null,0,false,0,c53i7xa,t3_vccdr,t1_c53i7xa,t1_c53apmt,null,1429193710,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Yep, poster above managed to get a very good deal because the manager was an idiot. Under the law of contracts, prices advertised are not binding at all. The actual price is when the customer gets to a till and offers to buy the product at a certain price, called the ""invitation to treat"".

It is then the shopowner's right to choose to accept that price or not. Nothing is binding on the seller to agree to any price at all, if they don't want to.

Of course, for ease of use and to save time, it's far simpler for a shopowner to show the prices that he/she will accept for a particular product, and then just automatically accept offers at that level. Hence pricing on shelves and automated price systems at the till.

This is the legal structure that allows shopowners to get out of a bad deal if they have made a mistake in their systems or labelling. They are not obliged to accept a customer's offer, and nor are they obliged to sell at a guaranteed price.

In effect people who would have been miners 50 years ago today are doing work that depends upon academic fundamentals.

As we move more and more into a service economy we'll have people from the bottom 50% of society (academically) working in positions where their academic prowess matters.

The reality is that this was bound to happen.  When you finish mid-table you are always going to become a target for other clubs.  If anyone comes in and offers more than £16M the club would be foolish to not at least consider it.  Agger sounds like he will be signing an extension and we have Coates plus it might be time to transition Martin Kelly back to CB so we have some depth.  Who knows what the future holds for Carra, too.  As long as the transfer fee goes back into new players then I would not be terribly disappointed, though obviously I would prefer him to be back.

We also have to consider that he might not be a great fit in Rodger's system.  He's not a bad passer but it isn't his strong suit.  He would be a great defender in any system but he may not be quite as impressive if he is asked to spend more time on the ball and pressing attackers.  When I was watching Denmark I couldn't help but think that if Skrtel leaves then we could swoop in for Simon Kjaer.  He has struggled these past two seasons in systems that do not really fit his style and he hates his manager at Wolfsburg (who I think technically still own him because Roma never completed his full transfer) so he could probably be had for £5-7M.  Alternatively, you could spend all of the Skrtel fee plus some extra and try to get Mats Hummels who is probably the second best passing CB in the world right now, after Pique.

**EDIT** to save on multiple replies:  I don't really mean we should go out and sign Hummels specifically.  I'm just trying to make the point that there are very talented defenders out there who we could go after if we suddenly have £20M to spend (Skrtel fee + a little).

French involves reciting a long essay which is either written solely by your teacher or just from notes you have been given - your job is to just regurgitate the whole script on the day, I for one will not be able to speak fluently in French, yet I seems to be getting A*'s.

Now, Science, the truly dismal subject that sparks fear into every candidate in the country, someone the questions have spelling errors which comprehension unattainable; the irony is, they often use 'command words' to get away with asking you question that are not directly on the syllabus, per example: 'Suggest a reason....' To add insult to injury, the mark scheme is very strict and if you explained an answer differently. No Marks, for you.

Now, we're on to the perhaps ill-thought subject in secondary education. We're given three 'articles' from reputable news sources and we have to answer four question on all three, after my trial I couldn't even read a god damn news article again. Alas, I couldn't even bring myself to read Reddit at-times, due to the fact of true boredom after the Exam,  it's a subject without merit and the majority of people in my year struggle with the differences in 'your and 'you're' and somehow they come out with A's and A*'s.

Now onto 'computing' (inverted comma's), the subject purely consists of office skills and is very much lack-luster, the 'practical' exam is just plain MS word. Me, being the only one in the school to know how to program (C, Kernel Hacking, Java, OpenGL) just code in the lesson and the teacher often talks to me as she is interested in learning to code - some teachers are fine, but others find it patronizing.

There are many ways that people pay taxes, and poor people pay a much larger proportion of their income on the most regressive taxes like VAT.

The fact is, if one views the State as a black box, it currently operates as a syphon of wealth from the middle and bottom of society to the wealthiest, that's the problem which needs to be addressed, to focus on ""simplifying"" taxation is to start at the wrong end of the equation, instead we need to be looking at those parts of the leviathan which are currently subsidising the wealthy and to be downsizing those.

I know. why didn't they just tweet a condemnation of Carr? why is there no reference to Carr, but instead a reference to Phil Green, and instead a semi-defence of Carr, critical of his Carr's critics? 

I hope they will start protesting individuals, indeed they already do (eg. Phil Green). In the process they are going to have to target people who generally support their ideas publicly, but privately avoid tax. But they would at least gain some of my respect for being consistent in their approach. 

I have no real issues with UK uncut, I simply disagree with them. I think their approach on this issue does indeed show a hypocritical mindset, as do many on the left who condemn tax avoidance/high wages yet have villas in France and engage in similar tax avoidance schemes (Toynbee/guardian).

As to the sideshow; yes of course it is. but UK uncut itself is a sideshow, because the tax avoidance issue is over such a relatively small amount compared to the debt out country is in.

The regressive parts are national insurance (11% over £6500, so that's £1430) and VAT, which, again I can't estimate. But I'll guess for sake of argument that everything you buy with your disposable income is VAT-levied. So that's 20% of £15k = £3k.

So I guess £4k plus fuel duty, which brings us to around £7k = ~35%.

From income tax and NI, you pay £3,877.64, assuming you aren't married, getting tax credits etc. I assume that you don't have a student loan. If you do, minus another £405. Not exactly a tax, but it's a deduction of your income.

Council tax average is £1400/yr in the UK. I assume you're living alone, so -25% for single occupancy discount = £1050

Your old car is probably exempt from road tax. Petrol - at 55mpg, and 10,000 miles per year = 181 gallons = 822 liters. At an average of about 130p/L (=£1070), approximately 62% of the cost of fuel is tax (http://whatgas.com/car-finance/fuel-duty.html), meaning you pay another £663 in tax for your petrol.

So total deductions so far, not including student loan = ~£5660. Making your direct tax rate approximately 29%, not including VAT on most things you buy.

Of course we haven't accounted for rent, bills, food, leisure activities etc. Also heavy tax if you smoke or drink alcohol at all. And alternatively I don't know if you get any sort of tax credits. I assumed not.

Personally, I think the tax system is ridiculous. On 19500/yr you're hardly wealthy, earning less than average and probably struggle to save enough to be able to put down a deposit for a mortgage.

Firstly, it's not a strawman.  A strawman is something like me saying ""Jimmy Carr is a tax cheat"" and you replying ""Yeah, but he's a really nice guy and does lots for charity."".  The strawman there being that I never said he wasn't a nice guy.  

And, frankly, there is a problem with these schemes.  Yes, they withhold less tax than some large firms manage to avoid paying, but they still stop significant amounts of money going to the exchequer.

And secondly, there's an implied social contract.  People benefit from the machinery of the state, and largely those who are well off will benefit more.  After all, if you build a factory and make a ton of money, then you will benefit proportionally more from things like an educated population to build and run it, and things like roads to help transport your goods around (or drive on to watch comedians perform in regional theatres(theatres which are also supported by government grants)).  Therefore you should probably pay a bit more.  This is the issue I have with him, his decision that actually he doesn't want to pay what we, as a society, have decided is his fair share.

Uni isn't for everyone, you are obviously happy where you are, just don't bemoan what you don't know. 

1) People who go to uni earn more overall. This is obviously important to you since you mentioned your salary.

2) Going away from home is a life building experience. You learn to live without the help of a support network and build your own. I learnt a huge amount about myself at uni, including good life skills like how to cook well, living on a budget, finding a flat/house, living with others etc. Granted, I did a lot of this on my gap year, but I did come across people in halls who quite literally could not boil an egg.

3) Being with friends, yep, you can still see friends from home. You will also meet loads of new ones. That's one of my best points. I have friends from school and from uni.

4) You don't have A-levels, you are not academic or you learnt a trade. Well, you are one of the 60% of the population who doesn't need/want to go to uni. That's great, and I wouldn't push you into it if I was a careers advisor or parent.

However one disadvantage is lack of nearby facilities, so although you'll be able to walk to work in a flash, if you're relying on the buses to get further afield then it can be a bit of a pain. If you've a bike it'll take you about 15 mins to get to the Cowley Road depending on where you are, 25-ish to the city centre.

A big minus point for me - makes me sound like an alcoholic, but you know what I mean - is the lack of any decent pubs within walking distance (there's the Mole in Toot Baldon which is a mile or so across the fields but that's more of a restaurant than a pub tbh). If you like having pubs, facilities, a variety of shops, etc on your doorstep then you're probably better off living on the Cowley Road.

(Bus-wise, the 12 goes through Greater Leys three times an hour but is only hourly in the evenings; outside of this you need to walk to BBLeys and catch the bus there, from where it'll take about 30 mins to get into the city centre depending on traffic on the Cowley Road).

""Congratulations you've been given a 25% pay rise!""   

""Wow, that's great.  That's over £4k extra a year.  What do I have to do?""      

""Nothing much, just a couple extra duties.  Staying behind after we close a couple of times a week.  Coming in early to cover every now and then.""     

""Wait I'm now paying all this extra tax on this £4k, now when I work it out the extra hours I'm working equates to below minimum wage!""     


    




An extra 10% mark up from the previous rate is one thing, that's why it is progressive; nothing to something significant is another.

It's like looking at a car's gear box and saying it would be much simpler if you took out the second and third gears.  It would be, and between 0-10mph and 35-60 you wouldn't know the difference.  If you're trying to get up the hill at 20 you would though.

Medel could easily be available for 5m. Chievo has resigned themselves to losing Bradley, and he is reportedly available for 5m too. Faurlin will be slightly more expensive, but he was the best player for QPR and his statistics don't lie. 

I don't know where this ""limited funds"" myth has come from, everyone is just speculating that we will have less to spend after last season's spending spree. FSG are unlikely going to throw Rodgers a box of Kit Kats and 20p of change to rebuild the squad. There will likely be limits, so 20million pound players are possibly out of reach, but the lack of a 2nd DM was the main reason for our collapse last season, and Rodgers would have to be blind to not strengthen that part up. 

I've stated repeatedly that I hate this idea of having a sub-par ""back-up"" player. Any DM that we bring in should be getting the chance to fight for a first team place. It is absolutely imperative that we have 2 top class players in this vital position if we are to challenge for the league. The DM position is one of the most vulnerable to yellow cards, and any DM we bring in must be expected to play a substantial part in a season that can extend beyond 60 games.

£18K job with an 25% pay rise would mean your take home pay after current NI and Income tax would be £17,662.36 a year.

Take home with flat tax of 40% after £18K = £19,800

**Another example (Medium earner):**

£35,000 earner. Current take home after NI and Income tax = £26,162.36

Take home with flat tax of 40% after £18K = £28,000. 

**Another example (Middle class):**

£70,000 earner. Take home after NI and income tax = £47,208.96

Take home with flat tax of 40% after £18K = £49,200

**Another example (High earner):**

150,000 earnings. Take home after NI and income tax = £90,618.96

Take home with flat tax of 40% after £18K = £97,200

**Another example (Extremely high earner):**

250,000 earnings. Take home after NI and income tax = £138,618.96 (This is ridiculous since anyone earning a cool quarter million will be avoiding most of this tax via clever accounting)

250,000 earnings. Take home after NI and income tax = £157,0000

Everyone is better off from a flat tax up to about 50% seemingly. Not taking into account the added purchasing power allowed when you get rid of VAT, etc. 

If you take into account the abolishment of every other tax as well then you could probably do a flat tax of about 60-70% and people would STILL be better off on the whole.

You also have the opportunity to finish a GCSE early and take another one, or make an existing one up to an AS level by further study. 
In addition to that, I doubt very much many people can remember when they did in their exams at school now, whether that was O-level or GCSE. 

 You then end up with people getting an A* who actually don't have a full grasp of the fundamentals but merely get an A* because they did well on the module they did two years previously.


No you cannot get an A* like that, courses have caps on how much each module is worth towards extra mark. This is the same for A levels and University degrees too. 

&gt;Businesses have been saying for years that the method of testing in GCSEs isn't working because they're seeing applicants without basic rudimentary understanding of subjects but with high pass marks. 

Source? For years and specifically to GCSE? 


&gt;This was never ever the case with the O level.

You have a poor memory then, this was exactly the same with O-level, one test, one exam, meant learning things parrot-fashion rather than with any understanding. It shows an ability to remember things on one day and is not an indicator of a students overall performance or ability.

So the company is worse off, your progression is worse off because it's easier to split it into part time worker and pay effectively less, and the chances of promotion and upward mobility are crushed.

The problem is the economy is fucked right now. So the state has to take steps to improve the situation, and in the mid-to-long term, it has to deal with long term unemployment as well. I do have to state again that I do not think workfare or similar should be something that is used all the time, just that it does have a place as a tool which can be useful in a small number of cases as part of a flexible incentive to get people into proper paying jobs. The scheme as it is being used now doesn't seem to be doing this, so this is why I don't think the current implementation of workfare works.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's not that it's stubborn it's equality.  If you are willing to pay someone to do the exact same job, to the exact same standard, what is the equivalent to £150 in their pocket then it is only fair that another person gets the exact same deal.  If they're already above the personal allowance and it means taking on a slight hit then fair enough, it's not like you have to travel to work twice or eat the same meal twice, it's offset.  Taking a big hit for a crappy job is however, crappy.

&gt;You can either have £90 for a bit more work, or we can hire someone else part time for £150.

Hire someone else for a £150.  I'm not demeaning myself by being paid close to half the market standard for the same job.  It's a great way to undermine the whole bidding process and promotion scheme.  You could turn around to an employee and exploit unskilled workers.  Sure you could start paying someone on £18k £25k instead, but you know you can give far more bang to your book and have another dog's body for less if you just hired someone else.  

""This is worth another £150week^-1 job.  Unfortunately for us to pay you a £150 more it would cost us £210, so you're not going to get the promotion, we're just going to get a contractor in to do the little extra work - and you're stuck in lower class.""

&gt;That persons hardly going to be a high flying billionaire on their £150 part time wage, are they? 

Nor are they likely to be if you've just dried up another way of getting into middle earnings!

&gt;Plus you're using the example of unskilled labour (A job where you can just get some part time randomer in) which is hardly something to base an entire tax system on.

It's a major flaw to any system when you realise you start clearly defining separate classes and putting tax moats around them to make it more difficult to trade up into a better situation/class.  You're going to find it very difficult to move up from a low paid job to an average paid job, and if you do, you're going to be at the lower end for a lot longer.

It's not controversial to say that small loopholes actually aid and progress economic development.  They're actually what drives entrepreneurial endeavour.  It's only when they become big enough for corporations and the rich to drive through that they become a problem.

And incidentally this was the exact same finding of the recent GAAR report by Graham Aaronson QC for the Crown.  That closing the small loopholes, which is what a flat tax would do would be detrimental to the economy - so even fewer jobs and smaller wages again!

People in 18k and PAYE don't as a rule create jobs.

Flavour one is the sad, personal, ""curse of the timelord"" scenes which mostly occur when he's alone or thinks no one can see him. Things like him checking his death date on the screen without telling anyone, whispering to the TARDIS, talking to Stormy or dodging a personal question with a sad smile and a change of subject. I love these scenes, they make my heart ache for him and show how good Matt Smith really is.

Flavour two is the ""what the fuck are you doing"" angry scenes where he kind of looses his timelord rag at the people around him. Things like ""No body HUMAN has ANYTHING to say to me right now!"", or shouting down people at Demons Run, blowing up the cyber legion or gettings angry because the Daleks got away. These are rare, but infinitely more terrifying because they are rare.

I doubt his regeneration will be angry, he's already pretty much accepted death in this regeneration (even if he did cheat it) so that leaves a content regen, leaving on an up note or a sad, lonely regen.

They are not like a job agency and won't actively look, or match you, to a job.

They may take an interest in you, later, if you are on benefits too long.

My advice? Clean up your Facebook act, start thinking of how you can use it as a networking tool. Open a twitter account and follow people/companies in your field - make every tweet count!

Don't be a nuisance though - learn to be subtle and considerate!

Buy the local papers, check everything online - watch out for employment agencies and their false dreams.

Most important, make finding a job, your job!

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;The problem you're complaining about already exists in the current tax system but at an even lower rate where people need the money even more. 

Evidence of something going on elsewhere isn't relevant when proposing a solution.

&gt; 2 part timers for £8K is easier than employing a single £19K employee in terms of expenditure by employer.

But it's more gradual.  You have 0%, 20%, 40% and then tax credits, or soon to be Universal Credit.  If you take on extra work you do get closer parity.  


&gt;Hell, the guy in my finance department hires 2 part time assistants for that very reason. 

&gt;Your argument makes no fucking sense.

The principle of what I'm explaining, and what you propose fully embracing, 'makes no sense' because as an example of a concept there is already a working example of it in your own office?!???  You've just argued that not only does it make sense, you're observing it.

You just want to expand the situation further.  

In stead of having one job where someone could learn and gradually develop, he breaks it down to two lesser paid jobs and doesn't create an interim position that could serve as a stepping stone to even better work.  Only now you're advocating doubling the effect.  Instead of making fewer £16-20k jobs you double the personal allowance and create fewer £20k-30k jobs.  Same effect only on a more damaging scale and level.  Less than £20k is entry level - you need to the £20k-30k jobs to to stand any chance of progressing up the career ladder outside the academic route.

&gt;You'll be on 18K tax free. Why the fuck are you complaining?

Because you'd be killing upward mobility and enterprise.  A major crux of the GAAR study was don't whatever you do tie up the loopholes just big enough for small or medium sized businesses to navigate.  If you do you will kill the jobs market.

You think it's difficult to get meaningful work experience now.  Wait until everything is broken down into its components to keep the payroll as close to the £18k personal allowance as possible.

&gt;Literally everyone is better off with the flat tax as demonstrated but you're still trying to pick hypothetical holes in it.

Think it through.  If you're saying everyone is better off then how is the country better off?  You're either raising less or someone else is picking it up; business or the collapse of social programmes.  You're not Frankeh The Magical -you've not just pulled a rabbit out of the hat.

If everybody is better off where's the money come from or where have the services gone?  And you're not going to stay with more disposable income for long as market prices will simply readjust.  You'll be consuming the same but there'd be fewer jobs and fewer prospects - so on top of all that your average wage is going to be at best frozen to reflect the tougher job market.

Added to that and the problem that has been made aware through Jimmy Carr and the use of K2 wouldn't even be affected by your proposals.  The whole point is that rather being paid to himself, which he would have had to pay tax on, it went to an offshore trust.",0,1340290860,null,0,1340304114,0,c53lpf1,t3_vdfz7,t1_c53lpf1,t1_c53l992,null,1429195352,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

[edit] OK, allow me to elaborate:

&gt;*It's common sense and human nature.*

These terms are rolled out time and time again to explain as a sweeping generalisation as to why some individuals act selfishly, with greed and in their own self interest but are time and time again denied when it comes to selfless acts of altruism, generosity and compassion. It would seem that acts of selfishness outnumber acts of altruism but they do not.

Surely, if being selfish was ""*common sense*"" then none of these kids, in one of the pooorest areas of Manchester, would have returned a single penny [of this guys money](http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1581427_thats-grand-youths-chase-after-1000-in-banknotes-blown-down-manchester-street---and-hand-it-all-back-to-man-who-lost-it) but he got every penny except a single £20 note back.

It would also be ""*common sense*"" and ""*human nature*"" for [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Florida_Flight_90) to be selfish and act on his own sense of self preservation and be rescued first but he didn't, not once but until every other person trapped with him was airlifted.

Again, it would be ""*common sense*"" for [this runner](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb_xS1eSA2k) to just jog to the line and not be last in this race, which was about being competitive, instead of helping the other girl up and putting her across the finish line first.

All of these examples are not exceptions either. It would appear that plenty of people on this very site [have experienced or performed](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=acts+of+kindness+strangers) random acts of kindness for complete strangers.

I put it that acting selfish or greedy is not 'human nature' but conditioning that fucktards like Rand perpetuated to justify her own infidelity and her own inability to care about others.",0,1340292161,null,0,1340296920,0,c53m1ai,t3_vdfws,t1_c53m1ai,t1_c53jbnj,null,1429195506,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The whole tax and spending system needs an overhaul, and public spending was/is completely out of control. I'm not saying abandon the NHS or anything drastic, but we are spending more and more every single year and it's unnecessary. I worked in the NHS for a year and I saw how much money is wasted. It's mind-boggling.

It's all very well saying that taxes should be higher, but WHO exactly will they tax more? The 50% bracket for ""high earners"" backfired completely as they all dodged paying tax anyway. It brought in less than half of what it should, because they all just dodged it. Yet every single year taxes and the cost of living go up for us ""normal"" people - petrol is up like crazy, VAT now at 20%, council tax in the thousands every year etc. Taxes in the UK are already incredibly high. We don't want any more.

If you had a reasonable suggestion for a ""communist"" plan, I'd listen. But right now I'll assume that it's totally unworkable. IMO, the best approach is lower taxes, more individual responsibility and freedom to spend our earnings how we like. Safety nets, yes.

As long as he is pressuring the ball at all times in the midfield the other team is more susceptible to making a mistake. While he is doing that Stevie will have to cover in the back for a second in case anything gets through. It is my personal opinion but I like a dynamic team that is able to change positions at any time to either defend better or move the ball around the field. This is was Rodgers is trying to do with Liverpool (which I am a huge fan of)

While Hodgsen has a VERY rigid 4-4-2 formation, Stevie and Scotty seem to have a nice understanding of one another.(for the most part, its not perfect but its not like they had a whole lot of time to prepare) 

Scottie trying to block the ball with his face was simply him getting beat by the attacker, the guy was simply quicker and got him on the dribble, but this doesn't happen very often.

The reason Lampard and Gerrard shouldn't start together is because they are near carbon copies of one another, they have a very similar style of play and like attacking up front. Having them both on will clash, leaving the midfield exposed for the other team to directly face the defense (and I think he might be hurt right now, the CL seems to have done a number on him).

Overall I think it is a good match between the two, you might disagree but the truth is that they just won a pretty tough group so they must be doing something right.

After December, we had an average of 1.3183 points per game. The clear difference maker was in the absence of Lucas, and any capable midfielder in his place. 

You're right to say that right midfield should be the first priority, with a striker the second. However, it doesn't mean that we can go with a mediocre backup in the DM department. I believe that Faurlin and Bradley will see their star rise heavily over the next 2 seasons. If we don't take them now, there's no guarantee that we can acquire them one or two years down the road. Right now, we have an opportunity, when these players are still at relatively mediocre clubs, and can be tempted by money. 

As you can probably tell, I am a great admirer of Faurlin and Bradley. Let's say we spend 15 million on a right winger (Krasic should be cheap, Susaeta and Narsingh should both be available for 10 million), another 15 million on a striker (Rumours are quite strong on Borini, I like Yilmaz, who has a release clause of 5 million), and 5-10 million on a DM (Either Bradley or Faurlin). That's a total spending of 40 million for 3 players. Add the 8 million for Gylfi to that for 48 million spent. That's less than 50 million to solve both our offensive and defensive problems.

true,Clbull,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"&gt; French involves reciting a long essay which is either written solely by your teacher or just from notes you have been given - your job is to just regurgitate the whole script on the day, I for one will not be able to speak fluently in French, yet I seems to be getting A*'s.

Michael Gove's made one good reform in his two-year history as Education Secretary and that is compulsory language lessons from the age of 7. If I were him though, I'd make it compulsory from 4 - 5.

The problem with learning a foreign language is students start in secondary school when it becomes tougher than if it were indoctornated into you at a young age. Even if you took it at GCSE, you'd still only have five years and about two to three 1 hour lessons a week of a specific language, on top of homework to do and you'd lack the oral experience of speaking to those fluent in that language which is kinda necessary. Plus there really isn't a good choice of languages to learn. For me, French was compulsory Years 7 - 9 and I had to choose a second language (German, Spanish or Italian, I chose Spanish) and had to do that Years 8 - 9.

I would have *loved* to learn a language like Russian, Japanese, Korean or Mandarin Chinese at primary school. Plus the ability to be bi-lingual would have been pretty damn helpful if I say... wanted to leave Britain and settle in another country to find work.

&gt; Now onto 'computing' (inverted comma's), the subject purely consists of office skills and is very much lack-luster, the 'practical' exam is just plain MS word. Me, being the only one in the school to know how to program (C, Kernel Hacking, Java, OpenGL) just code in the lesson and the teacher often talks to me as she is interested in learning to code - some teachers are fine, but others find it patronizing.

Computing *exists* at GCSE level? When I was there, I took two computer-centric GCSEs, namely ICT (which was actually a GNVQ qualification) and Business &amp; Communication Systems.)

I'm not kidding, you described both subjects perfectly. My coursework for ICT was basically to make a terrible personal portfolio (not even remotely for any professional purpose) webpage in Microsoft Frontpage. As for Business &amp; Communications Systems, it was basically a crash course in how to use the Microsoft Office suite with an occasional one or two lessons dabbling into touch typing. In fact, I learned virtually nothing from B&amp;CS because unfortunately I was put in the class of morons who would not only sit around and do nothing but also start disrupting the class for others by making loud nonsensical distracting noises constantly while the teacher is talking, throwing crap around the room and generally being dicks towards anyone wanting to actually focus.

About 30% of the lessons I had resulted in the teacher losing control of the class and calling in the head and deputy head. Because the class was that bad, I was basically thrown into doing the Foundation exam instead of the Higher one the other group was taking. It was the easiest exam I ever sat yet all I could ever get was a C grade.

Until I took A Level Computing, I never did any programming at all, and even then A Level Computing involved me learning fucking Visual Basic 6. Something that had been obsolete for almost if not over 20 years. The only reason I found it remotely challenging was because I had never had much experience with it in the past.",0,1340295134,null,0,1340296113,0,c53mtij,t3_vclip,t1_c53mtij,t1_c53ix8y,null,1429195875,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Plus you'll need a LiPo battery and a decent charger. LiPos are potentially dangerous if charged or stored incorrectly, so make sure you read up on them.

Decent soldering Iron (40W+) and all the usual tools are needed as well, most connectors/heatshrink etc you can get from Maplins/Overlander.

It's mostly just connecting stuff and soldering on connectors.

I was joking about the face thing by the way for emphasis, haha. I'm still of the belief that he is not good enough for a two man midfield and that Gerrard is making him look a bit better than he actually is (I think the understanding isn't entirely mutual, Gerrard knows how to mop up holes in midfield, he's played with Henderson and Spearing last season! Ok this is a long parenthesis now I apologise). 

 I don't think I counted a single tackle by Parker in the game against Ukraine. Also, while it's fine that he plays a simple passing game; that's all he really offers on the ball.

 Having watched Lampard in Chelsea's Champions League run, I think he can be a very disciplined holding midfield player, he can tackle and he can pass a ball very well too.

 England have done well to progress and top the group of course, but I question the magnitude of Parker's role, could you imagine him against Spain? I think he'd be absolutely useless.

So as we've seen from the filming pics, episode takes place mainly in 1930/40's (??) new york. 

The Doctor, Amy and Rory are having a travel, and decide to go to New York. They run into some trouble with the weeping angels, and Rory gets sent back in time from one. 

The Doctor and Amy don't know where Rory has been sent back in time to, and they call in River (who for some reason is dressed as a gangster) to help them find him. They find his gravestone. Now they know where he was sent back to, but cannot go back and save him as this would cause a paradox. (If they saved him, the gravestone would never be placed there for them to find)

Amy obviously is very upset by this. Suddenly, weeping angels appear and Amy, in her despair, walks towards it. The Doctor is screaming ""NO!"" as she touches it, and is sent back in time so that she can live the rest of her life with Rory. 

The Doctor accepts his loss and goes and has timey-wimey tardis sex with River.

Agencies? They tend to provide for, either the good jobs, or the minimum wagers! You'll have to impress to beat the reliability of the eastern europeans though!

Of course, if you are pitching an agency for a £20K plus job, the agency will earn around 12.5% of your first salary (paid by your new employer, not you!) - they will need to put together a good pool of people towards their client and will tell you anything to stay in that pool - ""you are the best candidate...) Don't trust them!

If you really mean the basic, minimum wage job, it's hardly rocket science - the, mostly Polish/Easter European competition, ain't queing up with the CV's of the century!

They get minimum wage jobs from greedy employers who don't give a jot about anybody except themselves - so, forget the fancy CV, if you want a basic job, be harder working, and more reliable than the, err, Europeans..

true,xeraphine,lfc12,,"Talk to me when we scrounge up 70m. In all honesty, though, I wouldn't really be interested in any of the three, especially at the prices being bantered about.

Of the three, I think we're much more likely to actually be going after Muniain and Martinez. Both are pre-peak players (the favorite kind for FSG). But Muniain isn't really a pure winger or a pure striker. Muniain is certainly an exciting player, and any team would be improved with him. I just think that Liverpool can improve *more* by spending that money on a poacher or a real winger, especially given the supposed arrival of Sigurdsson.

On the other hand, Martinez might not want be interested in being a second choice defensive midfielder. If he is interested in coming, then I think we need to take a real hard look at him. I'm just not sure how FSG is going about securing a backup for Lucas. Hard to convince top players to play behind Lucas, but also hard to get sufficient cover...

And finally, Llorente is 27, and too similar to Carroll. I highly doubt that FSG would chase him, and I wouldn't want them to. If he were 21, or if he were (much) more mobile, then I'd be all over him. As it stands, I think Carroll can be just as good, if not better, in four years.

TL;DR - Best look elsewhere. Muniain doesn't quite fit our needs, Martinez might be too good, and Llorente is too old/similar to Carroll.",0,1340303662,null,0,false,0,c53p7a8,t3_ve5au,t1_c53p7a8,t3_ve5au,null,1429197080,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

For example, compare the ""Everybody lives!"" line from the Ninth Doctor at the end of ""The Doctor Dances"" with River Song's ""When you run with the Doctor"" speech at the end of ""Forest of the Dead."" You'll notice that both have the same basic idea, that sometimes, not all the time, the Doctor can do anything for good.

Also, the preoccupation with the Doctor's name, in both ""The Girl in the Fireplace"" and ""The Wedding of River Song."" Or the recurring motif of children being special, that's a much more strongly highlighted theme under Moffat's writing than RTD's. Similarly, drawing upon childhood, childlike trust and wonder, and childhood fears as inspiration for themes, that's also very characteristically Moffat/Moffat-era.

I've played online games with a fair amount of ~~yanks~~ North Americans over the years and I've just about got to grips with the difference in accents between someone from New York and someone from Washington. Texan vs Cali etc. Canadians being the most distinctive....

As the previous poster states though we do have a lot of different accents in England alone, but I still struggle with how much the accent varies up in Scotland actually.

Someone from Glasgow/Edinburgh or south of there, fine. But hell each 10 mile interval north from the capital and whoa, I'm having to ask them to repeat (read: Yer silly bell-jangler ye kno u'dstand weir Ama comin from?) what they said. Someone from Wick calling me a Maypole dancer is easy though.....

Also I'm yet to meet/listen to someone from the Shetlands and a little unsure whether they're harder to to understand tbh.

I can guarantee the animal profiteering will be entirely off the books and cash in hand. If I can figure out a way to prove this I will do. In the past I have seen him taking animals out in cages.. The situation where you can tell it is totally illegitimate. They are certainly mistreated. My friends keep guinea pigs and ferrets so I know how these things are supposed to live. Their shelter is definitely not warm/secure enough for a 24-7 housing.

What if he is aiding in some way towards their commodities such as Sky TV, games consoles, daily takeaways, animals, etc etc?? Bills.. That kind of thing. In terms of modern comforts they live more comfortably than us - as hard working, tax paying citizens. Yet are driving people away with their foul language, bad smell/attitude and dodgy doings.

Also.. Recently a child was playing in the path behind their house and put a nail/plank straight through his foot. Obviously I am biased and have no evidence.. Yet I could take one guess where it came from :\ so, health hazards as well. Why not.

The noise between 11-7generally includes doors slamming, kid screaming and them shouting/swearing. It is honestly not normal behaviour. As I write this that kid is screaming what doesn't even sound like words and they are shouting and swearing at him. Sounds like they just hit him too. They hit something. Then a crash and cue door slams. Now more screaming and thuds (10+ minutes this generally lasts).

One thing that helped with my case was calling my own landlord, explaining to her how bad the situation had become and having her contact the neighbour's HA on our behalf. Also see if you can get any other neighbours to complain and keep incident diaries. The more people that complain, the more likely it is something will get done.

Check with your local council to see if they have a noise team. If they do, call them whenever the noise gets out of hand and they will come round to your property to witness it. Even if the noise has stopped by the time they arrive, it will be logged with the council that a complaint has been made, this will help your case more. If they do witness the noise, the first few times they will just go to the neighbours house and tell them that they are bothering people and to keep it down. If the problem continues after a few visits, this is when they can start doing things like handing out ASBOs.

* First, his goal and assist tally wasn't even close to being matched by any of our other midfielders (barring Gerrard). 

* After Lucas' unfortunate departure, he played in a much deeper role than he ever had in his career. This led to a higher number of fouls than he should have had, and also decreased his passing efficiency. If you doubt this, you only need to look at his passing and foul stats after Lucas was injured.

Two aspects exist with respect to the comment above that I would like to address.

1.) Good tax breaks can be extremely effective in stimulating business or building critical infrastructure but this one seems to be horrific.

2.) What needs to happen now, and I mean immediately, is for the HMRC and your government to make the necessary changes that are needed to fix this problem, once and for all.

&gt; Why isn't HMRC going after Vodafone? Cos they made a judgement that it was better to definitely get some money from them rather than risk losing all in a court battle.

I honestly don't think the HMRC should have been placed in this awkward situation in the first place - but here we are.

&gt; Do I believe they somehow didn't want vodafone to pay it all? Not for a second. 

I concur. 

Still, in very real terms, this means that you and the rest of your country will have to pick up Vodafone's slack - not an enviable place to be, I'm sure we would agree.

true,xeraphine,lfc12,,"I think 40 million pounds including sales is much more realistic. I also want to note that I, and everybody else here, are woefully uninformed compared to the scouting, data, and analysis available to Brendan Rodgers and his team at Melwood. Any ""recommendations"" are really just shots in the dark, aided by whatever is available on the Internet.

Also, there's a whole host of players I'd absolutely love to see in a Reds shirt, but are just unrealistic (Eriksen, for one).

First off, it appears that Rodgers is targeting players who he is familiar with and, conversely, who are familiar with his system and philosophy. I think this is smart, and is something Mourinho is probably most well-known for. Liverpool don't *need* Sigurdsson, but Gylfi is a strong, strong player on the rise who will fit right into a Rodgers attack. On the other hand, the pursuit of Sturridge and Borini as our goal-poaching solution is very smart. Neither are too expensive, both are young, and both have played under Rodgers. Of the two, I would definitely pick Borini, as Sturridge isn't known to be the most hard-working. Borini's shot conversion has also been top-notch the last two years, which is something Liverpool should be after. For the £9 million being quoted, I think it's a good buy.

For the right wing, there's been murmurs about Krasic and Afellay. Both are over 25 (27 and 26 respectively) though, and I'd much rather secure young talent for Rodgers to mold. He had a lot of success with young players at Swansea, and I think he'll continue, by looking at Christian Tello, Adam Johnson, or Eljero Elia. All are young, blazingly fast, and available for less than £10 million. They all also play on the left, but Rodgers uses inverted wingers, so they'll fit into the system on the right. Elia is the more solid defensive option, while Tello is flashier. Johnson is British (and we all know how that worked out), so I'd go with Elia.

Coverage for Lucas is something I honestly have no idea what we could do about. I like Moussa Sissoko at Tolouse, but his price tag is pretty hefty and he didn't have the best season last term. He was linked with us last summer, but, again, he might be too expensive. Keita is available on a free to cover, so that should be looked at, but I'd rather spend £15 million on one of the Bender brothers. Lars is more likely to be willing to leave his situation, but it'll all hinge on whether Rodgers is willing to promise first-team football.

That should be about £40 million.

Suffice to say it is not used a lot, it's deemed extremely aggressive (I.e. questionable) and HMRC are already investigating it and may declare it unsound (and claim tax). Either way there is already legislation on its way that will beef up the general principles that HMRC can deem a specific avoidance technique illegitimate (making it much easier to stop these dead). 

They already have a rule of declaration which is making these circumstances easier to root out. 

Vodafone: it's a global problem that multinationals exploit different international regimes (e.g. apple in US) to avoid tax - governments are in the awkward position of enforcing tough tax law and potentially pushing companies and employment abroad (lots of businesses in the UK moved to Ireland over the last decade) vs collecting what they should. The calculation (controversial as it is) often comes down to its better for GDP to let some cases slide.

If one were to somehow fall through a wormhole while simultaneously holding the opening and shutting of the wormhole's ""walls"" they would be taken to another black hole. (I'm not too sure on that last part, but I know it wouldn't lead to a white hole).

Think of a white hole just as the theoretical opposite of a black hole, not so much its linked pair. A white hole would have charge, angular momentum, and mass just like black holes, but would throw out matter rather than absorb matter that fell too close to its event horizon like a black hole would.

true,cxs,english,Stoke,"As a **sociolinguist**, I suspect the idea with Dinklage's role in GoT was to be strongly and stereotypically upper-class British (as associated with the Lannisters) - which is why it sounds so out of place. This accent is in the process of dying, but is very much existent: listen to Richard Dawkins, for example. That's what this woman is trying to replicate, also, which is why her short vowels are so horrifically wrong. I think Dinklage did a great job, considering how different British accents are in their manners of articulation to American accents! 

It's easier to bring a vowel to the 'front' (eg, the 'aw' in Boston accent 'cawfee' or 'dawg') than it is to bring it 'back' (eg, the 'u' in Staffordshire 'love'), which is why it's easier for British accent holders to fake an American accent.

There were 997 goals scored this season in the Eredivisie, and 972 goals scored in the Serie A, which isn't too much a difference. Only 25 more goals scored in the Netherlands. The top 5 scorers  in the Dutch league accounted for 12.33% of all goals scored, very close to the Italian ratio of 12.03%. 

What does this mean? Let's add the Premier League into this. There were 1066 goals scored in the Premier League, but the Top 5 scorers only accounted for 10.69% of the goals scored. This means that there is a bigger spread of goals among the players. 

With lesser goals scored in both the Eredivisie and the Serie A, and a higher ratio of the goals to be scored by the Top 5 scorers, it is easy to figure out that players coming from both the Serie A and Eredivisie will likely score lesser goals in England than in their domestic leagues.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"&gt;when we all know 10 is a better Doctor

Au contraire, seven is the Doctor for me. And maybe 11 is hers. Ten was the first Doctor I saw. Seven was maybe the fifth I saw, or even farther back yet he still became my favorite. If ten is as good as you say, you won't need to convince her to do anything else but watch.

&gt;which is the totally wrong way to watch the show

I watched the entire new series out of order (pre-Smith) and it never hindered me. Like seriously out of order- some of the first stories I saw were the season finales and I had no idea what was going on or why the End of Time was so important or what Bad Wolf was. But I still loved the show and do. It makes more sense to watch series 5-6 and then go back to the other series. There's no ""wrong"" way to watch a show of such awesomeness.

&gt;it would have been smarter to start at the begging?

Man I don't know. If I started at Hartnell I don't think I wouldn've gotten into Doctor Who. It took Genesis of the Daleks to convince me of classic. But sure if you want to be rigorous go back to the beginning. Might want to prepare your sister for black and white tv.

If you're a fan you have some understanding of his views, beliefs etc. It's no different than liking anything else. Wow are you a Christian? Because saying you're a doctor who fan but not agreeing with what makes the man great is completely hypocritical. The Doctor likes and accepts everyone. And if he doesn't well meh, he doesn't let it stop him from doing good, but he doesn't voice a condemnation such as that. That's what's surprising and so interesting is how accepting he is. The first time we encountered the Ood I was terrified but The Doctor responded with complete indifference as though it were just the norm. Thus, I too was calmed and came to enjoy their company.

From my experience, what comp sci lecturers love is stuff that's easily digestible and entertaining. I used to do essays in Word with nice illustrations as part of the layout; whilst I recognise that the point of these was to demonstrate my knowledge of the subject, I think with hindsight I think I got good marks because there's a large element of confirmation to the reader - he's going ""yes, I know that, tick"" and the essay layout and writing style clearly made it easy for the reader to do that.

My comp sci lecturers were much like the geeks you find on Reddit - they love cool stuff, that shows technology being useful, or clever use of tech. IMO a great ""artefact"", if they're going to see it, would be a web-app - something that they can fire up in their browser and play with.These guys have a good appreciation that even something simple-looking can take a lot of work.

Lastly, it shouldn't matter what a person looks like for them to be cast in Doctor Who. Doctor Who isn't all about having fangirls, it's about enjoying the series. If you want something that needs actors to be hot, take Twillight, because the ONLY fans that you will see in the fandom are screaming teenagers (and sometimes pedophiles).

The 2005 ""reboot"" doesn't start off on a particularly strong foot.  The first few episodes are okay, but didn't hook me enough to prevent me from quitting on the show after watching Aliens of London/World War III (my personal pick for the worst episodes of the series).

So when I introduce people to Doctor Who, I generally give them sort of a ""greatest hits"" sampling of episodes to get them hooked before I start sending them through in chronological order.

I always start with Blink.  It's a fantastic introductory episode for a couple of reasons.  First, and mostly importantly, it's an excellent episode that almost everyone loves.  Second, it serves as a great introduction to the Doctor and who he is.  Sally Sparrow doesn't really know any more about the Doctor than the new viewer does, and so they end up discovering who the Doctor is along with her.

After that I like to give a good sampling of Chris Eccleston and Matt Smith.  Usually that means The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances and either The Eleventh Hour or Vincent and the Doctor.

true,jobsmanifesto,hampshire,Hampshire,"My son is studying PPE at Oxford right now. 30 years ago, I also went to Oxford (to do a science degree), but I had several friends who read PPE. 

First thing to say is that don't imagine that a PPE degree from Oxford is a passport to the glittering prizes. None of my PPE friends from university ever 'made it' on the political stage, and a few of them, like the regular, ordinary people they are, have struggled to find employment, especially as they crossed that despised watershed of being over 50. The only well-known contemporary (although we never met) I can name is Michael Crick, who did PPE when I was there and became president of the Oxford Union (... the posh debating society). 

Fast forward to today, where my son is there doing PPE. Although he loves the subjects and their interconnections, and has won minor prizes for essays, he has struggled and failed to find any kind of summer internship. Potential employers seem to want you to have already decided very firmly that you want to be an accountant, a finance analyst etc. 

Interestingly in passing, my son is definitely not heading for any kind of political career. He volunteered for a local political party a few years ago and was disgusted by how easily the parliamentary candidate found it to lie. If this is a representative pattern, then our political system is completely broken - it's set up to select precisely the people you wouldn't want to be running the country. 

So Oxford is not a short-cut to incredible success, at best, it can help you get your feet on that important first rung of the ladder. But neither is it (any more, or for a long time) an elite institution for the rich.

Remember that racism is about *imaginary* races. There is no ""black people"", there is no ""white people"". There's just humans. What racists do is they take humans and seperate them into imaginary groups based on arbitrary factors; and then make judgements about individuals based on the group that they are in.

Seperating humans into ""English"" and ""Spanish""; and then saying that the Spanish are lazy is racism. There is no ""English people"". There is no ""Spanish people"". There's just humans.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"This isn't true imo. Racism is about inherent characteristics. That if you took, for instance, a group of black children and raised them in exactly the same way as a similar group of white children, the black children's inherent genetic characteristics would emerge (usually these differences are phrased by racists in terms of violence, sexual promiscuity or a lack of intelligence).

Overplaying differences between people from different geographical areas or cultures can certainly be bad, and it can be used as dogwhistle rhetoric for expressing racist ideas, but it is a mistake to mix it up with racism without caveat. Not least because cultural differences between groups of people do exist. The Spanish do in some ways behave differently from the English, and people from one Spanish city behave differently to some degree from people in another Spanish city. 

To pick a well-known example of how these changes might manifest, in China people who help others who have been hurt in the street are sometimes held responsible for the injury, and sued by the victim, or the state. After that legal possibility becomes well-known, Chinese people will quite reasonably be less likely to help someone in that situation, and this cultural tendency may persist to some degree even after the law is changed (although you would expect it to fade rapidly). That is not because the Chinese are inherently inscrutable, unfeeling, or untrustworthy (which would be the racist interpretation), but for clear-cut and well-justified reasons. And the same behaviour could easily emerge elsewhere if the appropriate legal measures were introduced; for instance, the well-publicized arrest of that 'big man' who was videoed throwing a disruptive kid off a train will tend in a small way to make people less likely to intervene in similar situations in future.

Albeit, of course, the general differences of behaviour within communities tend to be far greater than differences between communities. It is an issue of subjectivity (and being careful not to make lazy sweeping judgments), and of signal to noise ratio.

It may seem that you're helping to clamp down on racism by widening the definition in this way, but in my opinion you discredit the entire campaign, because you are attempting to defend an untenable position: the differences that you attempt to cover are in fact apparent to everyone, both in theory and in reality.

What Vodafone did was perfectly legal - as proven by previous court actions involving Cadbury's et al, and the HMRC backed down from trying to sue Vodafone because it had already lost several previous court actions and was frankly pissing money on lawyers to no benefit.

It's worth noting that the reliability of the law and tax code is a very important factor in encouraging companies to invest in the UK. The recent decision by the Indian government to change its tax law AND backdate the change by 40 years has serious spooked investors and resulted in downgrades of its economic prospects.

Whether the law should allow companies to register overseas organisations in the way Vodafone did is something for the politicians to decide - and as it was they who passed the laws in the first place, we can only presume that they were happy with such tax arrangements being created.

Ultimately, who do you blame, the company that seeing a legal way of paying less tax does so, or the politicians who wrote the tax laws like that in the first place?

&gt;Racism is the belief that different characteristics in racial groups justify discrimination. Some sources emphasize that racism involves the belief that different racial groups are characterized by intrinsic characteristics or abilities and that some such groups are therefore naturally superior to others, [1][2] or follow practices that discriminate against members of particular racial groups,[1] for example by perpetuating unequal access to resources between groups.

&gt;noun
1.
a belief or doctrine that inherent differences among the various human races  determine cultural or individual achievement, usually involving the idea that one's own race  is superior and has the right to rule others.

&gt;rac·ism/ˈrāˌsizəm/
Noun:	
The belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, esp. so as to distinguish it as...
Prejudice or discrimination directed against someone of a different race based on such a belief.

true,Peritract,null,null,"&gt;We’re reluctant to change education, what is taught and what is learned. 99 years ago Thomas Edison, the inventor of the motion picture, reportedly declared: ‘Books will soon be obsolete in the public schools…It is possible to teach every branch of human knowledge with the motion picture. Our school system will be completely changed inside of ten years.’ The fact that almost a century on, teaching and learning are broadly the same as in the 1900s perhaps illustrates education’s resistance to change.

That is one possibility. However, it is equally possible that Edison was wrong - making lighbulbs and educating children are not the same skillset. 

You can't just throw technology at schools and then declare them improved - it is not an unalloyed good. Without a clear purpose, it is just a distraction.

Luckly that wasn't anything like my example. 

My point being, the location you are born, effects your entire out look, it's not really debatable.

Someone in Poland for example, doesn't expect to earn more than £10,000 a year, because the minimum wage in Poland is £280 pcm, where as everyone in England expects to be paid more than that, because our minimum wage is higher than that. 

For facts like that alone, mass immigration is bad, it upsets the social balance, and especially for the working class - a UK builder will expect to get above £12,000 a year, a Polish Builder will be ecstatic to even get £9,000 a year. 

So when you cause a mass influx of cheap labour, then of course the people already there are going to be pissed off because it makes their lives harder, either they have to work for pittance or they find a new career, it's not racism it's economic concern.

Utilitarians would say though, that whichever course of action which brought about the greatest possible utility (generally considered to equal: good/happiness/lack of pain/suffering) would be the moral one. I tend to think those chaps have a shitty moral system, and opt for a deontological (Kantian etc.) system. I personally would say that if you *know* you are going to be costing the lives of other innocents in order to save the lives of some innocents then you shouldn't do that act. That is to say, if I for some weird reason **know** that by causing another car to crash I can save the original car, then I shouldn't use this technique of yours. If, on the other than, a possible side effect of me using this technique is that another car *might* crash then I'd argue that it's still moral to do it. I'm not crashing the other car to save the original people, it just might happen.

You don't think chasing him was moral?

&gt;To kill the taliban, do you know what they are? They are not a formalised group like Labour, they are a disparate group of shepherds and tribal elders.

The Taliban is a conservative islamist organisation, and yes, they are a formalised group. While there are insurgents other than Taliban who are not, by being a part of the Taliban individuals are necessarily part of an organised group.

&gt;What you just described is genocide and that reason has never been put forward by anyone in authority because it would be totally illegal.

No, it's not. I support the physical destruction of anyone who subscribes to the politics of the taliban. Now you could describe them as a religious group (your best bet at that ""genocide"" label sticking), but since I don't much care for religion as it is I wouldn't really be irked. I see what you're attempting to do, but your point fails. Left alone, I won't go out and join a group which will barge into schools and behead teachers, stone raped girls to death, or execute those who dare dissent from ultra-conservative values. Left alone, that's precisey what the Taliban did.

&gt;So do lots of other people, why them and not the others then? That is the pertinent question.

No it's not, frankly, it's an idiotic question which I already answered. Firstly, I *do* think action should be taken against any organisation, state or otherwise, which systematically and routinely goes about intentionally killing innocents as an end in itself. Quite clearly the United Kingdom is not militarily nor politically capable of taking on every single group which this applies to in the world. You talk as if that means we should do nothing, because if we can't do everything all at once we should do nothing, otherwise we're being hypocritical, right?

true,xanador,null,null,"I'll do my best to convey my reasoning.

Here's the thing: **TL;DR you have to understand the concept of time travel completely**. Time travel makes up a big chunk of Doctor Who, especially in the fifth and sixth season of the new series.

Since you're familiar with Doctor Who, I'll skip the linear explanation and the fixed/flux points that I normally give people and jump straight into orders of appearance from different perspectives. Hopefully this analogy will help you understand why Daleks keep popping back up after the Doctor defeats them. 

Points in linear time (what I call universal time) occur 1,2,3,4,5. The Doctor is a time traveler, so his points (in universal time) may be 3,1,5,4,2. The Daleks travel through time as well. Their points may be 5,2,1,4,3. With a little bit of thought you can understand that the Doctor's first time meeting the Daleks is, from the Daleks perspective, the fifth time they've met him, and to the rest of the universe watching the battles without time machines, only the third time the two have battled. It gets confusing for some people, but since you're a Whovian I  trust this should come fairly quickly and natural.

So thinking about it this way, the Doctor can defeat the Daleks the very first time he meets them but since they've fought him before, time has to follow through with making the Doctor fight them in his future. This is pretty much what Tennant means by ""wibbly wobbly timey wimey"".

So we can have an episode where the Doctor kills the last Dalek. That's it. No more. An entire race gone. And then have him fight them in the very next episode. The Daleks will never go away. 

As I said before, when you get to Matt Smith this kind of understanding of time comes in handy. 

Edit: I may have over-answered your question a bit. If you meant ""why does he keep meeting them? Why doesn't he just travel and avoid them?"" I refer you to user pcjonathan.

I would expect that people for whom that was true would be more likely to live in the sort of isolated communities where you would expect genetic diversity to be at its lowest.

Edit: To add to the above:

Firstly, the NYT article does not say that England is homogenous, it in fact says precisely that researchers were surprised that it is not more homogenously Anglo-Saxon:

&gt; The Celtic inhabitants of Britain were real survivors. *Nowhere were they entirely replaced by the invaders and they survive in high proportions, often 50 percent or more*, throughout the British Isles...

&gt; ...

&gt; [From the researcher] ''One tends to think of England as Anglo-Saxon,'' Dr. Goldstein said. ''But *we show quite clearly there was not complete replacement of existing populations by either Anglo-Saxons or Danes*. It looks like the Celts did hold out.''

To my mind, a set of populations which are sometimes half made up of one group, does not imply homogeneity.

Secondly, the researcher says the maternal line is much more similar than the male line to Northern Europe.

Edit 2: The paper, which is available [here](http://www.freewebs.com/flanneryclandna/PDFPAPERS/YCAPELLI2003.pdf), actually uses a grid-based sampling method, and excludes all towns with populations greater than 20,000 (and less than 5,000), which will greatly bias the results away from the metropolitan centres with the greatest level of genetic diversity.

true,haggiseatinglondoner,null,null,"&gt; Believing that humans can be separated into races is racism. That's what racism is.

Not by any commonly accepted definition. There are people of different races, that's just scientific fact. Geographic segregation lead to a divergence in our species' gene pool, causing different genetic characteristics (i.e. melanin levels, hair colour, height, a range of internal differences etc). Left long enough, we wouldn't just be different races, but different species, like the Neanderthals and other species of the homo genus. 

Racism is to extrapolate superiority/deficiency from those differences, just as sexism is to extrapolate superiority/deficiency from gender differences. It's a tricky subject because nature is itself racist/sexist. However racism is to focus on these differences and use them as justification for discrimination (usually with exaggeration of the differences as they remain at present time so small). To prefer your own race and/or segregation from other races isn't technically racism, it's xenophobia.

The 9/11 terrorists were trained in Afghanistan. Because of the Taliban, it was a hotbed of recruitment. The Saudis, being the oil-rich nation that they are, have strong ties with the west. If they knew terror cells were being trained there, they'd take them out. The Saudi royal family have the protection of the United States. They would do nothing to jeopardise that.


You are right about the opium thing. The west has wanted to stem the flow of heroin from there for a long time. In their short sightedness, they gave money to farmers to change crop. When they did this, the colossal fucktard Bush decided he didn't want to spend any more money on sorting out that situation, making the poppy growers understandably pissed off. Now they grow it with a vengeance because demand became so high. It's a lot more complicated than that, but the US administration did a fuck load of damage.

I opened the front door and shouted after him as to why he had done this.

He then claimed that he had been 'trying my doorbell for the last ten minutes and had no reply'.

After politely telling him that I'd just watched him walk down my drive without a package and thus his story was bollocks, I then told him to get the packages for me -  I'd actually paid significant extra posting charges to have next day delivery instead of cards put through my door.

His response was to give a pained expression and tell me that getting my packages involved 'looking for them in his van' and I should collect the packages at the depot in a few hours because he had so many deliveries to finish.

I complained to Yodel about this and was told that it was unacceptable and that it would be looked into as a priority. After a couple of weeks of hearing nothing, I called up to check and was told that they had no record of my complaint.

Seriously? The article is only 1000 words long. I don't think you did any reading whatsoever but here it is:

&gt; The Y chromosome is a useful way of tracking men because it is passed unchanged from father to son, escaping the genetic shuffle between generations that affects the rest of the genome. Also, all men carry the same Y chromosome, a surprising situation derived from the fact that in the ancestral human population some men had no children or only daughters, so that in each generation some Y chromosomes disappeared until only one was left.

Unfortunately, I don't follow the Bundesliga as closely as I used to, but I still look at the top scorer charts and read about the league/teams when I get a chance. He was the second highest scorer in 2010-11 behind Mario Gomez. He wasn't some crazy signing out of the blue like the Portuguese striker United signed a few years ago (although he got a lot of press for clubs like RM wanting him in the weeks before his signing). I'm sure Cisse was on lots of clubs' radar and Newcastle got to signing him before any one else. Good for them! Carr has done an amazing job, but he isn't signing players that weren't on any club's radar before. Newcastle identifies their targets and doesn't wait for their value to go up before purchasing. They don't wait around for other suitors to get involved. I think part of their success might be down to who they use as intermediaries. Other agents might open their mouth and get other clubs involved to drive the price up.

For every Cisse, there are dozens of players who move to the Prem from smaller leagues (not that the Bundesliga is a smaller league) who fail to live up to their transfer fees. Every transfer is a gamble, more so for a player who hasn't been tested in top competition. Players (especially strikers) from the Bundesliga usually adapt better and faster to the Prem than many players from other leagues; I'd say Cabaye or Ben Afra (more because of his head than his talent) were bigger gambles for Newcastle than Cisse. None of this is to take away anything from what Cisse did because he had a fantastic first 5 months in England.

Finally, I wasn't upset with being linked to Yilmaz, so I hope it didn't come across that way. I'd just never heard of him before.

The findings of the paper are that we're all predominantly Celtic in genetic make-up. Sorry if that makes you feel less English, but it's all there in print.

I live near Romford and my grandad lived in Bow. We'd meet that criterion but I doubt you'd complain that East London is insufficiently diverse.

&gt; And looking at the paper, even those people were selected on a geographical grid, which would again tend to bias the sample towards the rural population, which is more likely to be genetically isolated in that way.

Well, I've not seen the actual paper, but I still don't really see what you're complaining about.

That really isn't how a selection bias works. If I was trying to poll for belief in Keynesian economics, I'd probably find quite a fairly significant proportion of Tory voters were in agreement, but that doesn't mean polling only Tory voters (or populations predominantly living in rural areas, or in the South East) would give a fair representation of attitudes in the population at large.

&gt; In a study which seeks to study the geographic spread of gene markers introduced 1,000 years ago then it makes sense not to overly focus on urban populations in cities which saw most of their growth in the last 200 years - growth which was driven by displaced rural populations. That would somewhat skew the results, no?

But you're not making claims about the geographical spread of gene markers, you're making claims about the genetic make-up of the British population.
