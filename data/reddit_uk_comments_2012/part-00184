1. He's quoting a book.

He could have quoted a John Lennon song and it would mean the same thing, just because it's the Bible, it's sent random atheists into a shit fit

2. Christmas is a Christian holiday. You may say, oh it's a Pagan holiday because of when it is, but it's not, it's a Christian holiday which has it's roots on pagan festivals. I know many people who only go to Church at Christmas. I don't see the problem with the PM reflecting all this and using a bible quote.

There is only two determinants for British housing (in general): profit and central planning orthodoxy (read: macro/micro level social engineering). They (in general) don't even employ an architect to take advantage of natural light, with identikit designs shoe horned into any place they can.

The theory I developed several months ago is that the Doctor's name is the key to unlocking the Timelock of the Timewar.

This would of course mean the end of the Universe at a first glance, as we know. 

More importantly, since New Who, the Doctor seems to be linked to the Medusa Cascade. He visited (the rift there) when he was just a kid (90 years old), according to the soothsayers in Pompeii his name was written there and according to the Master he had singlehandedly closed a rift there. The Daleks also hid there and wanted to use the rift to echo the reality bomb to all of reality itself. Presumably this included Timelocked places...

From here on there are 2 possibilities.

1. He used the power of the rift to create the Time Lock. Using his name as a ""password"". 

2. He created the Time Lock in a different manner, but the rift at Medusa Cascade was open and created an opening for people to escape the Time War...So he went there and closed it, using his name to lock it. 

In either case though, his name would allow the Time War to return to the Universe. And we know what the Timelords intended to do...

Trenzalore can only be speculated about, currently, though. It could be located close enough to the rift that it would be dangerous for him to answer there... There could be enemies there listening in, etc The possibilities for that are endless.

BR said in the press conference that he needs someone who will get into the six yard box more (He told Enrique to do that and the next game he got his goal) and I think Sturridge will be great for that. He is a real talent that has been misused by Chelsea so here is hoping for the best. Let's try not to judge him too harshly until next year. 

Tom Ince will be great I just worry about first team exposure. Between him, Suarez, Borini, Sterling, and Sturridge we have 5 players for 3 spots. I just worry BR might not rotate enough for everyone to be happy. 

Rumors of Reinas demise I hope have been greatly exaggerated. I think we need to start grooming a new gk but I'd prefer we wait until summer. I'm excited by the prospects were linked with but a midseason change might be bad. 

I hope we can get the 9 million we're asking for Downing. Also glad to hear Cole linked with West Ham and QPR. Offloading those players will help a lot with transfers. I want Coates to go out on loan but In worried about him being bought. Rumor is Santos want to buy him for 9 mil we want to loan him. Being linked with these other center backs also makes me nervous for Coates. If he wants first team football then I can't blame him one bit.

true,KnownForNothing,lfc99,,"I think, in the future, Sterling will probably fall from grace once he reaches 25-28. I compared him to Joe Cole once - relies on pace and trickery to earn him his starting place in the team. While I think Suso is very Xabi-ish and can, if we can hang on to him, be a phenomenal player even in his early thirties, Technical ability will always be there, but pace will slowly go with age. 

Because of this, I would really rather hang on to Suso than Sterling. Not to say Sterling's bad, he's freaking awesome, but if I had to choose one to stay at Liverpooll for the rest of his career, it would be Suso. I think there are a lot of players that can take Sterling's place in the future, but not many players can take Suso's place. 

On a side note, I think we should have waited a while before offering Sterling a new contract (perhaps until June), didn't he have a good one/two years left on his contract? He's important for us for now, but after the Janurary window comes and goes, BR will likely be experimenting a lot more, putting Suarez on the left or right with Sturridge very likely to arrive and Borini recovering, both players whom prefer the central striker role. We'll be pretty well stacked on wingers then, with Downing, Assaidi, Suso (?), Shelvey (?), Cole and Sterling.

Also, I don't like our midfielder prroblem. It's a good problem to have, but I don't really like it. We have Lucas, Gerrard and Allen starting, and we have so many midfielders (Sahin (yes, he's on loan but still...), Suso, Shelvey, Henderson) eager to play in a more central role. And with Lucas only 25, Allen only 22, and Gerrard possibly signing a new deal (and still proving to be vital to the team), this could be the midfield for a *looooooooong* time. And I'm afraid our quality midfielders on the bench don't want to wait. Henderson and Shelvey are very obviously devoted to the club at the moment, but after being used as subs or being shafted to the wings for 2/3 more years, I'm really afraid they may start looking for other options.",0,1356363062,null,0,false,0,c7lhzfv,t3_15dg51,t1_c7lhzfv,t3_15dg51,null,1430759764,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

&gt;You've made a leap there. There is something up with US culture which ends in mass killings but to say it's the pure availability of guns that causes it is just passing the blame.

I did not say anything about gun availability, just something in the society. I can't say what it is, because I don't know.

&gt;There's much deeper routed social issues at the heart of this problem

I completely agree.

&gt;The 24 hour news cycle, poor mental health care, etc. I'd say they all have more to do with it than guns do. Guns are just the tool. 

The problem is that guns are a much better tool than anything else, so make it too easy.

Curiously we never hear much about the countless thousands who volunteered to fight for the other side (if there are any left). 
It wasn't just fascists who fought against the republican government,  the nationalist side was pretty diverse and had countless volunteers from throughout Europe and North Africa, many with religious and not political motives. The fact that they were on the wrong side of history shouldn't be held against them.

Young, fast, good dribbler, can finish, is creative and would probably be available for £5-8m, maybe even less. 

[Goal and assist vs Betis](http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/real-betis-1-rayo-vallecano-2/). Pace and vision for the assist, clinical finish for his goal.

[Another goal and assist vs Mallorca](http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/rayo-vallecano-2-mallorca-0/). Skip ahead to about 2:30 to see his disallowed header, followed by a goal from range and a run into the box that ends with him setting up a teammate.

[Assists both goals vs. Malaga.](http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/malaga-1-rayo-vallecano-2/) Watch that first assist and tell me you don't want to see this kid playing alongside Suarez. Doesn't do quite as much for the second, but that's still a clever move to get past the defender - little things like that go unnoticed too often, and he does that kind of thing regularly. 

[2 goals vs Espanyol](http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/espanyol-3-rayo-vallecano-2/). The first creeps over but the second shows the kind of composure we lack too often. 

[Goal vs Atletico Madrid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2_h5yi49Uo#t=1m57s). It's just yards out, but again, technique and composure. These make up a majority of his goals and assists for Rayo, but keep in mind he's 20, inexperienced and playing in a pretty weak team (Michu has almost matched his goalscoring total for last season already, by way of comparison). I've watched him several times and aside from a few outliers (Barca and Madrid) he's usually one of the best players on the pitch. In that loss to Atletico for example, he was one of the few creative sparks on his team and threatened throughout.

Responsibility is paramount to all gun owners bar criminals who acquire them illegitimately. It is a hobby or a passion to people, and people don't want to see their passions taken away from them or infringed upon so they take the onus of demonstrating responsibility to themselves and very seriously.

&gt;Any sort of law breaking would see removal of a gun license

_Any_ sort? Violent crime, maybe, but plagiarism? Unpaid parking tickets? Embezzlement? Copyright infringement?

&gt;Guns should be locked away when when not in use 

Why do you assume they aren't? Guns are high-value targets for criminals, and the common approach in the US is to have them locked away securely if you are out of the house or not using them/having them to hand for whatever reason.

&gt;There needs to be a register of all weapons, all sales of weapons and ammunition.

Why? What would this address? Are you just buying into media hysteria?

&gt;High powered automatic guns get moved to shooting centres

There are maybe a dozen ""high-powered automatic guns"" like the Browning M2 or M134 in the US, and given that they cost thousands just to fire for a few seconds - let alone hundreds of thousands and months of paperwork to ever buy - that's irrelevant. As for the type of gun you're alluding to - the ""scary assault-rifles with high-power full-automatic baby-killing high-capacity exploding bulletmags"" - those are neither automatic nor ""high-power"" as has been explained up above. The guns available to the general public (who aren't millionaires) simply resemble them ergonomically. They are popular platforms because they are successful platforms which are comfortable to use and customisable, and many shooters see the appeal in them due to the versatile ergonomics and ability to customise them to their preferences, as well competitive pricing. They aren't inherently any more dangerous than other weapons chambered in the same cartridge, they just resemble stuff a bunch of armed forces use. Aesthetically. They look similar. That's it.

I honestly feared for the ref's life when Noel Hunt stormed from the bench to the other side of the pitch. But during that initial 92 minutes, a mentality was becoming prevalent. It was like the team were finally beginning to click. It was refreshing to see a few smiles on the pitch. Compare the team on Saturday to the team who played Spurs, or Wigan, or Arsenal, and it was easy to see how much of a difference a certain few changes made. Let's see Karacan, Pearce, and Harte back on Boxing Day with a fresh perspective. And until then, let's hope the stormclouds over Federici can finally clear off, and that Pavel can go so far as to crack a goddamn smile. Get the team together, and they can do anything.

So, one of the things the players need now, more than ever, is to have the fans behind them, not talking about relegation or buying new players, or any of that. Look at it like this; we have literally nothing left to lose. When you've got a team at the bottom of the table and in the same danger we are, you might as well just cry Hail Mary throw the kitchen sink into the mix. If we're going down, fuck it, let's go down with a smile on our faces; and maybe that attitude can rub off on the boys as well.

But ultimately, we *can* still save ourselves. Wigan are on rubbish form at the moment, as are Southampton. And look at what happened at Villa! We can turn them over at home, and we can do the same to an inconsistent Sunderland. Teams like West Brom and Liverpool have been so thoroughly inconsistent, all it takes is a push in the right direction and we'll be shipping goals past them like no one's business.

There clearly is a problem and you are in denial.

That doesn't necessary conclude irresponsibility.

TL:DR: 
&gt; This Article has reviewed a significant amount of evidence
from a wide variety of international sources. Each individual
portion of evidence is subject to cavil—at the very least the
general objection that the persuasiveness of social scientific
evidence cannot remotely approach the persuasiveness of
conclusions in the physical sciences. Nevertheless, the bur‐
den of proof rests on the proponents of the more guns equal
more death and fewer guns equal less death mantra, espe‐
cially since they argue public policy ought to be based on
that mantra.
149
To bear that burden would at the very least
require showing that a large number of nations with more
guns have more death and that nations that have imposed
stringent gun controls have achieved substantial reductions
in criminal violence (or suicide). But those correlations are
not observed when a large number of nations are compared
across the world.",0,1356369505,null,0,false,0,c7ljcbx,t3_15d82c,t1_c7ljcbx,t1_c7lix00,null,1430760482,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

However, with Romeu out long-term and Mikel out for ACON, Luiz will basically never be available to fill in at CB, so if Terry, Cahill, or Ivanovic pick up a knock, we're pretty short on options.

My village has three housing developments, all of them are shitty small identikit box houses built down to a price with papermache walls. You can see them miles away from the village and they're an eyesore with no attempt to fit in with the locality (in fairness, the Taylor Wimpey one had the most effort placed in to it and looks the least objectionable). Someone now wants to wedge 29 houses into a field near me, where if you tried to fit in the size of house and garden I live in (early 1900s of sturdy granite) you might get 3. In terms of prices it's something like £200k for a ""town house"" - 3 stories, very small, no garden.

All of the housing developments have a fair number of unsold homes and plenty of ""for sale"" or ""to let"" from third party estate agents. I wonder why - is everyone moving out after realising how shit and small they are?

What's more, is that one of the developments has boxed in a primary school. Anyone who moves into the village has to send their children to a neighbouring village's school because our school is full and can't expand. What fucking inept overpaid planning official signed that off? Probably the same one who thinks building a ton of new homes near me is a great idea even though the road and water system can barely take the current load.

Unfortunately the council's planning dept don't care - make a few houses ""affordable"" (which is still waaaaaaay out of reach for the average wage earner here) and bam, instant approval for any kind of shite. I think we should scrap any kind of council tax discount for second homes, ban buy to let and property speculation, and enforce a reasonable standard of space and quality on new estates.

With this knowledge in hand, I think the following scenario is pretty likely:

On the Fields, there is a great battle, where Smith dies and doesn't regenerate.  River is there (and knowing his name), is asked the question.

That's tenuous. It could equally be that parents don't seek to lock up their guns around their kids because they prefer to inform and educate them, explain that they aren't toys and that they are dangerous. Many take this route and see it as being _more_ responsible than locking up and making a prize of something your child doesn't understand.

&gt;Yes all of those things, the goal should be to ensure that guns only go to responsible law abiding citizens. You break the law you lose your right to have a gun. If you're gonna break these laws what other laws are you going to break?

Idiocy. Not only, it ought to be whether you're _convicted_ of a _serious_ crime. Everyone on the planet has committed a crime, whether or not they're aware of it. You've exceeded the speed limit or played music at a certain decibel level in a populated area or had a beer before you hit 18 or been linked to a questionable image by some online contact - you've done it. _Lots_ of people have. That doesn't make them any less suitable for gun ownership than car ownership or parenthood or anything else that carries a weight of responsibility.

&gt;that was a typo, it should have said semi automatic. The basic premise of the idea being anything that can for more than a few rounds repeatedly

Well, unfinished idea aside, why? Lever-action guns can be fired as quickly as semi-automatic. The fact that it's semi-automatic makes no difference as to the lethality: it's in the shooter. [An ignoramus looking to make a name of themselves by buying a semi-auto .223](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCoFvH8zQYI) is going to kill and harm far fewer people than a [practiced, proficient shot using a bolt-action 7mm rem mag](http://youtu.be/bKh_13zOGFc). 

Note please: the video I linked to in the ""idiot with a .223"" linked both to someone familiar with very many firearms firing them fully-automatically, something the regular nobody in the US can do without jumping through many hoops. That is a fully-automatic FN MINIMI, compared to the semi-automatic AR-15 the media is focusing on.

The second video: that's someone who is very good at using the tool they've spent a long time studying. The adherence to the idea that a particular styling is going to suddenly make someone a shipman-league killer is absurd and ignorant. And before you go saying ""well then let's ban all guns if they can all be employed so proficiently"", let me stop you: shooting of that nature is commonplace in areas like the UK, France, Germany and the like. And we don't have double-figures massacres. Not due to the platform, but due to other socio-economic factors that require consideration before ""BANN ALL GUNS THEY WILL KUILL; UZ""

true,[deleted],null,null,"I've never bought hospitality tickets, so I'm unable to answer your first two questions, but I was a mascot when I was 9 (7 years ago) so I may be able to provide some kind of idea to what it's like:

Pre-match: You go into the hospitality area. There's food, drinks etc. and some old players (when I was there it was Bruce Grobellar and a few others that have slipped my mind) are around to chat and host a bit of pre-match amble. There's betting slips if you wish to use them. Then they haul the mascot up and ask him/her a few questions about the match (Result, scorers etc.) and then the mascot goes to meet the players. That is when I assume everyone else starts making their way to their seats/boxes.

Edit: I guess you may also get a tour. My experience was probably different to the normal hospitality because I was the mascot. But obviously if you get the tour, it would be before you go to the hospitality area, probably around 10am (assuming it's a 3pm kick-off).

In the boxes: (I was actually in the stand as a mascot, but having been in boxes at other matches I can tell you roughly): There will be food and drink again, as well as a bar I would assume. TV screens to watch the game live if you can't see the pitch properly, but unless the box is owned by a particular company/person you won't be alone. During the match obviously you mainly stay in the box/seat to watch the match. During half-time you go to the bar or whatever.

Post-match: Post match you may be able to go to the player's lounge (not sure how much access you need to have for that). Obviously the players go there to see their friends/families, the manager normally pops along briefly and there may be some old players again. Not much really happened there if I'm honest. I just got autographs and a picture with Rafa. 

There's also the museum and shop to look at if you have free time before/after the match and it gives you a real sense of achievement with all the trophies. ",0,1356377812,null,0,1356380790,0,c7lldh9,t3_15dpqn,t1_c7lldh9,t3_15dpqn,null,1430761432,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

EDIT: I've had time to collate my thoughts and my anger has died down. Thought I would offer my view on the episode as a whole as well as the ending.

The episode went up, down, up, down and then stayed down like a yoyo that got stuck. The fight at the beginning was very well done and the way Dragoon fired lightning everywhere was suitably badass. Then Arthur got stabbed and Mordred died and my reaction was ""What the fuck? Mordred actually was evil? I thought he and Arthur would have at least reconciled"". After that there was the large bit in the middle where Arthur and Merlin are together in the forest. This was done very well. The reveal was good and Arthur's reaction and later acceptance was perfect. Then Gwaine and Percival went after Morgana. What a terrible fucking idea. Gwaine's death could have easily been avoided, and it didn't even make sense. Elyan recovered after being attacked by the Nathair, why did Gwaine have to die? Then he was just left there to rot in the woods. Fuck's sake, BBC. First you kill off one of my favourite characters, then you do it in a bullshit way, and finally you don't even give me closure.

Then we go to the time before the ending and the ending itself. Morgana gets stabbed. That's it. Primary antagonist and High Priestess of the Old Religion gets stabbed in a way that Return of the King already did. Talk about an anticlimax. Kilgharrah swoops down as they reach the shores of Avalon and basically said ""Oh, by the way, you're buggered. Might as well let him die now. Arthur's actual fade to death was very emotional, but then it was revealed that Merlin became a fucking postman and there were more plot holes than I previously thought possible.

I personally think it's a very good problem to have and I'm not worried about the younger players (Henderson, Shelvey, etc) looking to leave the club. They are young, Gerrard won't be around forever (even with the extension) and - while there has been some frustration from week-to-week - Liverpool is a club on the up and up, and the younger midfielders are going to be a big part of that.

This 'problem' should also increase the level of healthy competition for everyone. Regulars to the starting XI like Lucas and Gerrard won't be rest easy. And the likes of Suso, Shelvey, Henderson, etc. will be battling each other to prove themselves and the best man will win.

Also, we'll be fighting a lot of battles on a lot of fronts... we're chasing a Champions League spot this season and next, we have domestic cups, we currently have Europa. Quality depth on the squad will ensure that we are strong on all those fronts.

Take fingerprints for example.  The systems schools use don't store images of the fingerprints themselves, but a set of numbers generated by a scan of the fingerprint which is then analysed for certain characteristics like the number of junction points and their location.  It's a much stripped back data set which misses much of the detail about the shape of the print itself.  This set of data wouldn't be any use to police forces even if shared with them (more on that in a minute) since it isn't actually an image of the fingerprint which is what the police still need to be able to present as an exhibit.  The same is true of face and iris recognition systems used in schools.

As to the sharing element, schools are bound by the data protection act which tells them in no uncertain terms that any sharing of data must be proportionate and connected with their normal day to day business and not related to criminal investigations.  The CPS might be able to subpoena the data, but even were it to do so, it would be of no use to them as mentioned above.

The Vashta Nerada win either way, and the Silence lose either way.

But don't think that makes Vashta Nerada the most deadly villain! No, that goes to the Angels. You can run from the Vashta Nerada, honestly they are rather slow compared to the Angels.

"" In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the *new*. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends. Last night, I experienced something new: an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's famous motto, ""Anyone can cook."" But I realize, only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist *can* come from *anywhere*. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau's, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in France. I will be returning to Gusteau's soon, hungry for more. ""

- Morgana's death. Although, that has been covered enough on this thread. Stupid stupid stupid.

- The Dragon only flying Arthur and Merlin half-way there. What's the point? Did he just feel like being an arsehole? They still had to get across a whole bloody lake opposed to going all the way there, saving time and maybe Arthur's life.

- If Merlin accepted Arthur's death then why didn't the Dragon fly both of them back to Camelot so the KING could have a state funeral? THE KING.

- For one second I thought that Percival was going to get some much needed character development. ""RAAAAA"" he breaks free like the Hulk, finds Gwane dead (which was an utterly pointless death), gets ANGRY by Gwane's death and... fucks off back to Camelot, rather than go and help Merlin and Arthur? 

- The ending. Wow. Because in the future there's definitely going to be a need for a random resurrected King, right? ""I'm King Arthur of Camelot!"" ""Of course you are, mate. Off you go.""

- How did the whole of Camelot find out about Arthur's death before Merlin got back? Unless the the different scenes took place at different points in time, it made no sense.

- The first fifteen/twenty minutes of the episode were great but the closer the episode got to the end of the forty-five minute time slot, the more I was thinking to myself ""Yep they've cocked this one up. What about this, what about that?""

The reason they are used in more crime is because they are more prevalent. Most massacres (which after all is the real problem we are discussing) involve semi-automatic rifles.

true,[deleted],null,null,"But in many unionised industries there isn't an effective monopoly on labour. Working in a shop or a factory or certain service industries can all be unionised and it's no big deal, as anyone can do the job and freely choose if they want to be part of a union. It's also no big deal if these people choose to go on strike - it's not the end of the world if the ASDA near you has to close for a day.

Meanwhile in the rail industry, those within it know that it would be very hard to completely replace them, and that if they were to strike the costs to the country, fare-paying passengers and so on would be immense. So the rail companies bend over and secure a deal that isn't necessarily in the interest of all parties - just the ones carrying out the extortion - because the government and train companies want the trains to keep running. During the Olympics it was even more crass, since there is not a chance in hell there will be strikes during the one time Britain *has* to shine.

&gt; You say that certain workers in the rail industry are paid more than commuters, that's probably more evidence for wages being too low across society than too high for train drivers

Many companies don't have an effectively guaranteed income - whereas the rail industry is fairly captive. We are not forced to shop at ASDA or any store that has a unionised workforce, nor do we have to buy products made in unionised factories.

Meanwhile, unless you drive, you may be forced to use the underground/DLR/train/whatever, and therefore pay the fares that are partially based on the demands of rail workers who know that they'll get what they want if they have a hissy fit. 

Not every company has a magic pot of money with which to pay employees more, which is what you seem to think they have. I don't think it'd do well for inflation if everyone kept getting massive pay rises to pay for an increased cost of living.

&gt; The working class are always an exploited group, and as such trade union presence can never be too high, as long the union is properly representative.

Rail workers are not exploited. We're not in the age where unions were essential to secure basic working rights, a standard of health and safety, reasonable pay, etc. No one can deny that rail workers don't earn a bloody good amount for the job they do, they have immense job security, and they get several perks. For example free travel on their own service - something the ordinary passenger has to pay an ever growing fare for.

To put it in perspective, when did you last hear about a train company having to lay off a ton of employees? Or give them pay cuts? Or take away some perks? I'm fairly sure it hasn't happened. Meanwhile many of the paying passengers have had to experience all of that in their respective industries.",0,1356388371,null,0,1356389616,0,c7lnrhy,t3_159qww,t1_c7lnrhy,t1_c7lnn2y,null,1430762564,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The protection is stronger than allowing plod to go fishing.  If they were to present a subpoena saying ""give us the data pertaining to student X"" then we would have no choice but to comply but to say ""give us all of your student data"" would have to pass a very, very stringent test and would definitely be appealed by a headteacher all the way to the High Court.  Headteachers are very jealous of their schools in every way and all the ones I know (an admittedly small sample of about 8) would fight tooth and claw to prevent such a flagrant fishing expedition.

The data controller in all state schools is the head.  He may devolve the day to day operation of the role to another (in this case me) but the role itself can't be passed on.  To protect schools from all having to have people versed in legalese, we all buy into County services for advice and interpretation so thankfully don't have to wad through the Act itself but rely on them for plain English interpretations of it, which is what I'm repeating here.

There's actually a very valid reason for using this sort of data to take registers.  Go back 30 years and all that needed to be recorded was the presence or otherwise of a pupil in the morning and the afternoon.  Nowadays the registration is take for every lesson, and attendance officers need to know within 10 minutes of so of the start of a lesson which students are present or missing.  This allows almost real-time tracking of students, allowing in turn a tighter control on internal and external truancy, which schools simply have to keep a tight hold of these days.

The ability to take live, lesson based registers relies on up to date IT systems like biometrics.  We don't yet have it at our place due to cost, but not having it really hampers us.  Were we to have a thumb reader at the door of every classroom, we would have all of the information there at the drop of a hat without having to rely on teachers managing to get the register taken and input rapidly at the start of the lesson which hampers snappy lesson starts, objective setting and keeping a lid on low-level disruption before it even starts.

So it's not a case of bordering on incompetency really, but using available tools to run an efficient learning environment with a minimum of fuss.

true,KarthusWins,null,null,"I thought it was a great episode; it brought tears to my eyes multiple times. Morgana's death was very much appreciated, and I didn't really care that she died so simply. The truth is that she was defeated, delirious, and pathetic at this point and needed to be put down. Her attempts at revenge were over, and I'm glad Merlin was the one to plunge a sword in her abdomen. While the dragon could have breathed his magical life powers on Arthur, the legends hold that Arthur would return when we need him most, so technically he isn't ""dead"". I do feel, however, that Merlin's fate should have been explained more fully, as I find it sad that he is walking aimlessly around somewhere in Britain believing that he is a failure. I wanted there to be a scene where Merlin returns with Arthur's body to Gwen, they have a funeral, and Merlin explains that he is a sorcerer and takes up a position as Court Wizard as it is told in the legends. 

This only allows for there to be a movie release to explain the life of Merlin after Camelot, and maybe it foreshadows the return of Arthur in such a film. I doubt that the producers would speculate over a movie for no reason, let alone release a Merlin Game without taking notice of the possibility of expanding further with the series. The plot is clear; they set it up perfectly. Why not have a problem arise in modern-day England, and Merlin and Arthur come and save the day together? The whole Merlin-Arthur supernatural relationship thing didn't disappoint me, as it indicates that Merlin has and always will serve Arthur and be close to him. Perhaps people aren't considering exactly why he took up a job as a postman? It's clearly to be close to Avalon, so when Arthur rises again, he will be there.  

Anyway, I believe it was a decent, cumulative ending to the greatest series ever produced on television, and I am eagerly anticipating a Merlin movie to arrive in the coming years.

I'm almost 25, and I don't think I've watched the original since I was about 5 years old, so tonight, my Snowman-oblivious American wife and I watched the original Snowman, followed up immediately by The Snowman and The Snowdog.

The nods to the original were great, especially the motorbike in the shed, the old belongings under the floorboards and how the Snowman comfortably wandered around areas he had explored in the old film.

I thought it was really interesting that James (from the original Snowman) lived in the countryside in Brighton (I think?) and the new kid moves in to his old house, which is now based in densely populated suburbia. I'm not sure if this was intended as some kind of social observation, but I thought it was interesting nonetheless.

I also thought it was interesting that they replaced the dangerous night time motorbike ride with the penguin sled-race. Before seeing the new one, I commented while watching the original that ""they'd never get away with having a motorbike ride these days"", so it surprised me to see that they threw in a ride in a stolen plane!

My only two criticisms are:

 1. Why replace the original song? The new one was decent, but the original was amazing, and so iconic. I thought it would've worked really well.
 2. What was the point in the plane ride, when The Snowman can fly? Maybe I missed something.

I'm so thankful that Channel 4 didn't play any adverts during the show, nor did they ruin the end credits [with a squeeze and a voice-over](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yrm2dj6bIU0&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB). Really nice touches.

I'm also grateful that the animation style was kept *exactly* the same. I'm glad they didn't try to update it or make a 3D rendered animation.

**TL;DR**: Classy, respectful handling of an old classic. Great stuff. Hit me right in the feels. 

Now, I just hope they don't feel the need to touch it again for another 25 years.",0,1356393364,null,0,false,0,c7lot55,t3_15e0oo,t1_c7lot55,t3_15e0oo,null,1430763058,15,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,15

Crossed london, got train to family home.  Ate dinner and watched some surprisingly non terrible tv (Ronnie Barker evening on 2).  Wrapped presents, hopped on reddit, and now I'm off to read a book.

Sounds like envy to me. Envious that they've got the fucking balls to do what you're too fucking chicken to do you snivelling pencil pushing gutless fucking turd. 

They make money for nothing in your eyes. However as you're only the fucking paper shuffler, what do you know about what is involved, the risks they've taken to get where they are, the things they have to deal with on a daily/weekly basis? All you see is the numbers and seem to be under the assumption that all they do is collect the rent. 


If you're sick of dealing with them, the solution is an easy one. Hand in your notice and let someone who is grateful for a job do it. If I were a customer of your companies as a LL and saw your posts, I'd be questioning whether or not you were providing me a proper service I was paying for.

I'm sick to fucking death of whinging cunts like you who do nothing other than whine because someone who had the balls to put a chunk of their money on the line is reaping the benefits of it.

Internet is not an issue.

There is this stuff called concrete. It's cheaper more insalitive and cost less to build due to its larger size. and you can put you pipes inside it easily. American houses armade of wood instalation and siding because they don't need to be strong.

Open plan houses came from design shows on TV to get more people to spend money on the kirovhen something we use to hide before. 

Once warm or cool and house should stay so due to insulation! You should really only heat the area you are in. Boilers and radiators are stupid and should not exist anymore. 

Rooms here are too small they should be twice the size. I won't take a shoe box and I live in central london and hertfordshire.

true,Jangles,CupFinalsCrest,,"ITT: Bad ideas and lots of them

Why do fans insist we bring in a top level number 9 like Falcao or Cavani. We have Aguero, probably one of the finest off the shoulder strikers in the world and with the most vicious killer instinct I've seen in front of goal in a City top. Sitting on the bench we have Edin Dzeko, a proven finisher and a player who despite certain fans beliefs, Juve would still bite our hands off down to the shoulder to have. So why would we buy another one when we can barely give both of them enough time as it is? What City need is a replacement second striker for Tevez. Has anyone noticed we tend to look a bit shit when Silva's injured? Its because when that happens the entire creative burden falls on Tevez. Nasri isn't despite what people might think, the most creative player. His time at [Arsenal](http://arsespeak.com/2011/02/14/the-difference-between-arshavin-samir-nasri-creator-assassin-data-analysis/) shows this. Milner is just a workhorse with half-decent crossing, Toure can do it from deep but he only really gets the chance to do this 3 or 4 times a game. Barry is as much good as a chocolate teapot in the final third. That shoulders the creative responsibility to Scott Sinclair and the fullbacks and considering the standard of our squad that isn't really good enough. I don't disagree that Balo's days at City might be numbered but do think about bringing in a player that actually meets our needs rather than the flavour of the month. A Gotze, Isco or Eriksen is more suiting than Falcao.",0,1356401303,null,0,false,0,c7lqc10,t3_15d27z,t1_c7lqc10,t3_15d27z,null,1430763841,7,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,7

You see, there has been a message brewing ever since *A Good Man Goes to War*. A message that the word ""Doctor"" has become split.

On one hand it means wise man and healer, a good man. This is what the Doctor has tried to be for a long time.

On the other is ""warrior"". The Oncoming Storm, the Time Lord Victorious. This is everything that the Doctor has feared he will become, and what he's always been on the brink of becoming.

So the question is: which path will he choose? What decision will he make at those Fields? 

Because that answer determines whether the Silence are trying to spare the world from the wrath of an angry god or are trying to prevent  the Doctor from realizing he's a truly good man.

He was (and remains) an awful journalist, someone who used real gutter press methods to get his stories. He told total lies over the UK's phone hacking scandal, in which his newspaper hacked into celebrities' phones in order to get stories.

He sent photographers to try and get some dirt on satirist Ian Hislop after the paper which Hislop is the editor of, *Private Eye*, reported on a share-tipping scandal in Morgan's newspaper. Morgan sent photographers to tail Hislop and offered rewards for any dirt on him to his friends. They came up with nothing.

But above all else, by far and away the biggest reason nobody likes Piers Morgan? He's just a massive cuntbarge. He's a devious, slimy, simpering, name-dropping, power-hungry, pudgy-faced, smarmy, lying little bastard. Saying ""I like Piers Morgan"" is enough to turn you into something of a pariah in Britain.

true,ravniel,num11,,"&gt; the only reason he is leaving is because Inter want to cut his wages

This is why I don't understand how this rumor has even gained traction for  a second.  Isn't it self-evident that a player leaving over a wage dispute will only join a club that *won't* lower his wages?  Isn't that pretty simple common sense?

EDIT: I do have one dispute with your comment, though.

&gt; Levy doesn't sign players with little or no sell-on value (15m - 20m at the age of 28, Sneijder fits right in this category) Also a certain Mr.Van Der Vaart comes to mind, sold only for ""good business""

Van der Vaart actually provides the counter-example to both the points you made just there.  He was less than a year younger than Sneijder is now when he signed for Spurs, but that deal was still good business, because he was available for quite cheap.  Levy isn't above signing an 'older' player if he can do so for reduced price.  Dempsey is another.  Van der Vaart was *also* sold two seasons later for a significant profit, so not everybody in their late 20's has no resale value.

Not saying any of this applies to Sneijder, I haven't paid this saga the *slightest* attention so I don't know what the particulars are said to be.  Your price for him seems a little high to me, though.  Not on the basis of talent, but for a pretty thoroughly marginalized player seemingly desperate to leave it seems like more than Inter can reasonably expect to get.",0,1356407619,null,0,1356408292,0,c7lrlbk,t3_15eipj,t1_c7lrlbk,t1_c7lr15i,null,1430764428,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

With the sword in the stone, Merlin actually being an old wizard, rising from adoption, Magic not thought to exist etc etc.

I actually think the more off putting thing was then to tie it into the real world.

I find it quite funny that he took advantage of the England development system, all the way up to the U21 level, and then 'suddenly' decided to play for Nigeria; definitely a typical Nigerian move.

Personally, even though I loved the series and even these last two episodes, I felt it was a bit anti-climactic. 

I mean, basically, Morgana won despite the fact that she died as well. Merlin didn't amount to anything except a few scenes where he went Super Saiyan and Kameha'd some dudes while not even going after the dude he's been dwelling on first, which led to Arthur dying after all that lead-in of him getting his powers back. Basically, Merlin failed in all respects, only prolonging the inevitable for a few seasons. 

Getting his powers back didn't really save the day since he still failed to save Arthur (though, I suppose according to other posters he was supposed to die here or something based on the original stories). Either way, not even seeing Merlin head back to Camelot and protect it as an old man and just become a random wandering hobo in the future is a pretty shitty way to end an otherwise fantastic series. 

It would have been a nearly acceptable ending if it wasn't for that last bit with the truck whizzing by. Totally unnecessary and pretty much stabbed a sword through the heart of the show just like what happened to the two main characters. I mean, seriously; Arthur supposed to come back in modern times (or the future) and be all like ""I was king once. Now let me rule this futureland""? It's not like he ever had any powers and was pretty much just a loyal and good-willed dude. 

He'd just be a cognitive zombie taking on future armies that have robots and laser weaponry. They made sure the series ended here with a single truck. Without that truck, it could be speculated in what unknown time-frame in the future old Merlin actually was. Just saying, there was quite a bit they could have done in the ending and they chose one of the worst ways to go about ending it in a few anti-climactic seconds.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Here we go...

The seventh Doctor is my favorite. I told myself when I started watching classic many months ago that I wouldn't pick a favorite. I wanted to love all the Doctors. And I do. But the seventh has stolen my heart.

He's got a dry humor with a dark Time Lord power underneath, and of course, a kickass companion: Ace. Their relationship is so unique, it's a tag-team ""you do the talking, I do the walking"" with 7 as a sort of stand-in parent/guide and tutor. Yet at the same time, it's almost, if you want to put on the goggles, romantic. But because of the tutor/guide thing and 7's distant otherness, it's very platonic.

And by dark Time Lord power I mean that during the seventh Doctor's era you got the feeling that while the seventh seems like a goofy dusty professor on the outside, sometimes you can tell there's an undercurrent of something. This something is alien, it's terrifying, and it's dangerous.

But it's different from the godlike awe I get from the tenth Doctor. This is where it gets hard to explain. The tenth Doctor's godlike-ness, in my opinion, relates to his vanity. Both are very unique to the tenth Doctor (unlike the shallow narcissism of the sixth or fourth).

But the tenth Doctor makes you think that he is some kind of tragic and lonely god high above us who lives in another plane. The seventh Doctor feels more like a pervasive sense of otherness. Dark otherness. (That and it's been pointed out to me that while Tennant is a fantastic actor, he can't do ""eccentric"" to save his life despite being a master at barely-concealed-anger. McCoy has the opposite acting strength/weakness.)

Btw, this dark sense of otherness is very strong in the novel Lungbarrow. Funnily enough, he is revealed to be the Other in the novel and his cousins in the House of Prydon often wonder what the Doctor is. He's Time's Champion for one thing...
What's interesting is that I say these things about the seventh Doctor but I don't know how I reached this feeling. Probably because of the story Remembrance of the Daleks. It was my first seventh Doctor story. I think. I don't know why, but there's something compelling about his personality. It's a blend of dignity and humility, comedy and darkness.

In retrospect he's also an amazing Doctor (and I'm more sure he's my favorite now) because of his excellent run on Big Finish Productions' audio drama range. McCoy's stories have made me cry. Yup. And break my heart. And just recently I listened to what is, imo, the best radio drama* I've heard yet out of 200+ and it's with SEVEN.

*Despite the term ""radio drama"" it's primarily just for purchased on www.bigfinish.com (though it has been on radio).

So, let's break this down: you started by showing your ignorance on the topic. You then took affront when I identified it. You then did nothing to save face, and instead carried on digging in the same direction. You disregarded information and retaliated with conjecture and reactionism. Why exactly are you continuing?

true,ravniel,num11,,"&gt; over bettering our depth up front and behind Dembele.

But again, at least those are positions where we already *have* players performing at a high level.  Sure, depth would be nice, but in the no. 10 position we don't even have *one* consistent performer.  I'm not writing off Gylfi's chances of coming good, but he's unarguably struggled for form, and Dempsey's not really suited to the no. 10 position in a 4-2-3-1.  When everyone is uninjured we have every spot in that formation filled with a good, in-form player *except* the centermost of that attacking midfield three.  I have a hard time not seeing that as a target area in the transfer window.

Don't get me wrong, I'd like another striker and I think another player in Dembele's position is an urgent necessity, but in both of those positions at least we have *one* player performing at the adequate level.

I'm not arguing that Sneijder should be the target, either, and I definitely think he'll be too expensive.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"To drop the facade and speak bluntly: I think you're overestimating the staying power of toyetic cartoons. Rarely to they last five seasons, let alone *seven*.

There honestly comes a point in time where their demo is too old to be interested and the costs of production don't make up for profit in sales. At that point the show goes into reruns and a new line is launched to spark new interest and a new buying fervor.

MLP is first and foremost an economic tool and while bronies will diligently create their own art and products in tidal waves, their purchasing of licensed products is low. 

Hell, just look at yourself, for example. How much money have you actually given Hasbro for their efforts? How much money do you imagine the average brony gives back?

Hell, the entirety of the show's up on YouTube and Netflix (partially). You could (and many fans who skip watching live do) see the entire show without witnessing so much as one commercial. 

Sure there'll be plenty that see this issue and will attempt to drum up enough forces to buy the actual toys, but these numbers are getting less and less with each purchase binge. Bronies are more willing to donate to charities and do actual good will than begrudgingly buy shoddy toys (that are often not even screen-accurate) in a forced exchange to *possibly* squeeze more episodes out of Hasbro.

I'm looking at this from a socio-economic standpoint. If Hasbro wants to make money (and they absolutely do) they will milk MLP until it's dry, then immediately sever. That's the common business sense that they've demonstrated with every show they've made.

Hell, a massive chunk of the Hub's programming is re-runs of shows like Batman: TAS and that garners them a pretty damn sizable audience with zero effort on their part (outside of purchasing nessecary broadcasting rights). They know from experience that re-runs can be popular.

Hell, if they were *really* smart they'd kill it right here, right now while the fandom's charged, wait for petitions to flow it and people to buy merchandise in droves as a desperate attempt to bring the show back (*a la* the public response to the word of cancellation of Firefly or Community).

You...havent seen my collection have you? Even if they get half for their shirts, I spent *at least* 700 dollars with them through apparel and blind bags. 

&gt;they will milk MLP until it's dry, then immediately sever.

Exactly. Its already been announced that they cut seasons to 13 episodes to make more money. They will continue to do this until its not worth anything. Additionally Hasbro has shown a (I think) 30% growth in MLP merch and money made from it each year it aired. Cutting it would drop those numbers in half and we both know it.

&gt;Hell, a massive chunk of the Hub's programming is re-runs of shows like Batman:

Actually a massive chuck of the revenue comes from MLP, the Transformers series, and the new Pound Puppies. More reruns are used simply to fill the void in which most viewership drops  to a fraction of what new episodes bring. 

&gt;Hell, if they were really smart they'd kill it right here, right now while the fandom's charged,

Uh no. That would be idiotic. Imagine how many people would instantly leave when they heard the series was canceled. Even after all Ive bought I would too more than likely. I would head over to the Avatar sub or stick it out here. Fact of the matter is stations dont cancle their highest rated show. Look at Johnny Test. It has WELL over a hundred episodes simply because it is popular. Not saying that will happen with MLP but it has AT LEAST 2-4  more seasons of profit in it.

Their guns are seriously that ridiculously important to them.  American gun culture and the culture of living in constant fear of what is around the next corner is out of control.  And as cock_blockula said, The Constitution may as well be the Bible to many Americans.  They see it as something that should be followed to the letter and should not change with the times, that its values should be eternal.  America is a country that is usually behind by anywhere from a few years to a few decades in its legal system and its social climate.  Hopefully the crazy gun culture, fear culture, constitution worship, social climate, and Bible banging will subside within a decade or so as the younger generation takes over.

For that matter, your original post and its title certainly make it sound like you are pre-emptively banning submissions of *any* Christmas gifts. It doesn't mention anything about only applying to mass produced items. Also, your sidebar notes are not clear on this either. Posts ""must not contain"" merchandise posts... But you like merchandise posts if they are interesting, old, or new? And then a sentence fragment about using search, because we all know how convenient and reliable Reddit search is. That's... Not as helpful as you mods seem to think it is every time you tell people to read the sidebar. 

Again, it really sounds like ""we'll remove whatever we feel like, here's a general idea of what we usually like.""

But what really got to me (surprisingly) was Morgana's death. I did not want her to die that way: stabby stab, goodbye Morgana. That wasn't good enough! I wanted her to be entirely alone, I wanted Aithusa to turn away from her and go off with Kilgara. I wanted her to realise that her deeds and way of living was the real reason she was doomed. This may seem cold, but I wanted her to be full of despair and broken, I wanted her to be sad and regretful...instead all we get is stab, goodbye. That sucked!

I cried at Arthur's death. I really hoped that Merlin would have found a way. The series had already taken a lot of liberties with the legend's storyline (Gwen, Lancelot, Gwaine, Uther...). I don't see why they couldn't have done something different in regards to Arthur's death. He could have died an old man and still brought peace to Albion. 

I wouldn't mind seeing a spin-off or film come after this. I'm resigned to it being a contemporary piece. I don't usually like contemporary pieces because the world is way to complicated for it to make any sense. It's why I like period, fantasy and sci-fi stories, they're far away from real life. 

I'm sad to see this series end. It was a good run and didn't let me down. Anyone have any ideas about what I can watch now? Something with magic, hot guys, and a good storyline? Cheers.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Most recently, Russian giants Anzhi were also linked with the classy former Ajax and Real Madrid midfielder. 

&gt; Sneijder, 28, has not played for Inter Milan for three months due to a dispute with the Nerazzurri which was reportedly over his refusal to take a pay cut.

I think that should sum it up. 

To try and inject some sense in here:

Sneijder won't take a pay cut at Inter. Presumably, there would be little reason to move unless we're willing to match his current wages. That's all fine and dandy until you actually consider the wages. Close to 200k, reportedly, or enough that even United passed him up because they couldn't afford it. The 12m transfer fee? That seems reasonable enough. But unless Sneijder reduces his wage demands (I see no indication that this will happen, considering the entire reason he's leaving Inter is reportedly because he won't lower his demands in the first place), or Inter pulls a Man City and pays a significant portion of his wages while he plays for us (even more unlikely), I don't see this happening. If he really wants to move for the money, he'll go to Anzhi. 

That said, assuming we got him for a Levy Approved™ price and wage packet, I would fucking take him any and every day of the week. He's in poor form, but the man is an incredible player when he's firing on all cylinders. My only hangup with him is how injury-prone he is, normally he misses about 10 league games each year, which is pretty bad, but he generally made about as many total appearances each season as Van der Vaart did for us. Also he's really good at set pieces, so he can join our ranks of fantastic set piece takers who left their abilities at home.",0,1356426323,null,0,false,0,c7luxec,t3_15ev46,t1_c7luxec,t3_15ev46,null,1430766001,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

That is **not** what I said at all. I said it as a side comment simply to say how many there are. The effect of cause as opposed to the cause of effect.

If I removed everything I didn't like or I'm sick of seeing....then there'd be a lot less posts, mainly cakes and TARDIS gingerbreads. But I don't do that.

Yes, the sidebar is a little fuzzy, but we're at it's character limit and cannot add anything more. Hopefully soon, we'll attempt to move some of the things to a new place to make more room. The reddit search may not be that helpful, true. But I would suggest two things here. The user who submits it first can use a more descriptive title. This is often make or break for a search engine. And, most of the time, the user who searches can bother to use it. If I can find the post by simply putting in a keyword into it, then so can anyone else. The reddit search isn't going to pick everything up...but when we see stuff it *does* pick up, then we know where the fault lies.

It's what makes the EPL awesome. This is not the Spanish League where the Champion is decided on the third week, the is the EPL, the champion last year was decided in literally the last second. 

We still have to face United still have to face City again, they have to face us, Tottenham, maybe Arsenal can pull a tie. 

We win the next game and we're within, I believe, 8 points of them and 4 points of City and neither 8 nor 4 points are pretty much nothing in the EPL, especially at this point of the season. 

As long as Chelsea doesn't have another of their annual Christmas breakdowns in February or January, there'a high chance that the Blues can be champs. ",0,1356446732,null,0,false,0,c7lwu9z,t3_15c7m9,t1_c7lwu9z,t3_15c7m9,null,1430766902,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

The solution I found was to crouch on all fours in the bath and try to flush out each hit out of mouth and arse as thoroughly as possible.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"- Hodgson's old guard played shite football, Rodgers' doesn't. And Hodgson's old guard was literally fucking old. Joe Allen's a player who was being linked with Arsenal when we signed him.

- You realise that there's more than one person in charge of transfers, right? Yeah, Rodgers  fucked up the Carroll/Dempsey stuff, but so did Ian Ayre and FSG; the whole thing was a huge communication fuck up. And honestly, Carroll scored once every 5 games at best under Kenny; it wasn't as big a loss to the squad as everyone made it out to be. But I don't see any desperation in it - desperation would have been if they'd missed out on Dempsey and then rushed to pick up Nicklas Bendtner.

- I'm not saying I know a player - I never said anything definite. I just threw some questions out there, that's all. Your first comment really did make it sound like you knew Sturridge and grew up with him. I don't know if Sturridge is actually a selfish dick, I don't know if he'll be great for us, but I hope he will and I'll back him for at least half a season before I start to judge whether he's good enough.

Were the lizard-lady and her wife the two that were in a previous episode (I believe it was the Dickens one)?

(also, might want to mark this as nsfw for spoilers?)

Speaking of nsfw, that kiss really shocked me, but it seemed like she had residual memory of the Asylum, so I guess she felt she knew him even more than if it were just that episode.

That bit at the end with the Doctor freaking out at her grave was how my brain felt as well.

true,Freddichio,null,null,"Now, I have quite a few fan theories on this episode, so bear with me as I try to explain them.

First of all, and most simply, the memory worm. Introduced as a gag, and yet it gives the writers the perfect way to have the doctor meet Oswin (I prefer it to Clara) twice, and have her not remember him each time.

Secondly, I think Oswin will become a full-time companion, and not keep dying/reappearing. I know I'd start getting really tired if the first half an hour of every episode was 'Hey, look at Oswin figure out who the doctor is on her own!'

Now, the theories get a bit more weird.

First of all, I think in terms of Oswin being a full-time companion, that the most important questions are why did the Daleks turn her one of them? She's smart, yeah, but still only human. The Daleks are super-intelligent, supposedly, and they didn't convert Jack Harkness to a Dalek, despite him being immortal, and try to exterminate the Doctor rather than kill him. So what makes Oswin special? My guess is she wasn't fully transformed into a Dalek, hence the human emotions, Soufflés, and the like. Plus, we saw her die with the doctor in Snowmen, whereas in Asylum all we saw is the Asylum be destroyed with her (presumably) inside. But I think the Doctor saved her - not then, but the future doctor. He hasn't crossed his own timeline, he hasn't interfered with events that are fixed. He saves her, rescues her from being a Dalek (although a Dalek companion would be cool), and she becomes a companion - although she does eventually get bitten by the Memory Worm and gets left in victorian england - The Doctor left Donna with no memories, and has gone as far as leaving his granddaughter in a  very different, war-torn, time.

My main theory (and one I'm fairly confident is at least partly true) is that Oswin is Rory's mother. First of all, there's no mention of his mum - and I mean at all. Not at his wedding, no passing comments, nothing. Secondly, I was slightly irked during 'The Angels take Manhattan' that Rory died with so many unanswered questions. Things Amy never had, little things like the 'past tense' bit during the God Complex, and the 'Did you forget who you are?' line during 'Asylum of the Daleks'. Little things that were more than throwaway lines, lines that were clearly very deliberate, but ended at nothing. I think they need to be explained somehow. Thirdly - admittedly a bit of a stretch, though - but if she is his mum then surviving death repeatedly would run in the family - Oswin does it, Rory did it, and River did it. River has part time-lord DNA - while that could come from her being conceived in the Tardis mid-flight, there could be other explanations - although not with the Doctor. Him marrying his own granddaughter would be weird... And Lastly, Karen Gillan has stated that she never wants to return to Doctor Who, since it would make the farewell redundant. However, Arthur Davrill has said no such thing, and in fact appeared in the post-Manhattan webisode.

TL;DR - Oswin is Rory's mother, leading to an entire family of death-cheaters",0,1356466371,null,0,false,0,c7m0f48,t3_15ffjf,t1_c7m0f48,t3_15ffjf,null,1430768660,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

I was going to do one analyzing the latest iteration of MLP and the community surrounding it. 

I mean, it's a wholly amazing cultural phenomena. Entirely unparalleled. I was absolutely captivated and began collecting data on a documentary. A proper one that actually gave analysis and the community it's dues, unlike ""Friendship is Magic"" or other documentaries. Something that analysed it in an antropological and social manner. Without bias, without condemnation or prejudice.

But my enthusiasm died. So many told me it was a waste, a pointless exercise that only gave validation to the inane. I saw so many shoddy documentaries clog the internet on the same subject and gradually found my voice becoming less important.

On him and Clara flirting, to me on his end it seemed more like 'oh boy she can keep up with me!' than actual flirting on his end, though I don't know why he told her boss they were upstairs kissing *in Victorian England*, of course I'm totally looking through River/Doctor glasses, so I might be biased.

edit; On my shipping, I don't actually have anything against him and River having and open relationship, I just literally saw no romantic tension between him and Clara and I'm pretty sure Matt could play at having tension with a pineapple if he wanted.

3.) It isn´t Doctor Who without massive plotholes everywhere

4.) Somone else took control over the Tardis. It contains massive amounts of energy. See the last three episodes of season 1. The doctor´s enemies thought that he was the only one that could pilot the Tardis that would explode, they bult the pandorica to contain him. Based stuff on Amy´s memories to make it believable. The Big Bang is a giant plothole.

5.) They fixed it by touching. the time sped up a little bit when they touched in the pyramid before the silcence escaped. The fixed point was that the doctor would die at Lake Silencio at  a certain time. This is another giant plothole. Apparantly all that was needed was for everyone to believe that he died.

Advantages of a constitutional monarchy:

* an impartial symbolic Head of State above politics, commercial and factional interests.
* a focus for national unity, national awards and honours and national institutions
* a Head of State whom we share with 16 other independent countries because she is their Queen too and that links us all together amazingly and most valuably
* the Head of the Commonwealth because all 53 countries recognise her as this and so she is a special unifying symbol for them too
the centrepiece of colourful non-political ceremonial and national celebrations
* separate from the Head of Government (the Prime Minister), unlike in some countries where the two are combined, often with difficulty
able to give impartial non-political support to the work of a wide range of different types of organizations, faiths, charities, artists, craftsmen etc
* a Head of State completely under the democratic control of Parliament but not having to change every few years in divisive elections
at the head of a Royal Family who can share the duties and represent the Queen
* a constant, lasting symbolic head of the country with links back through our whole history and assured lines of continuity into the future
a worldwide well-known and respected symbol of our country carrying out State Visits and goodwill tours in other countries

How do you know she's impartial? Why should an unelected person get to officially be symbolic of our country? What if a sizable portion of our country don't want her to be our 'symbol'?

&gt;a focus for national unity, national awards and honours and national institutions

National unity is just a fancy term for irrational patriotism. It's stupid on every basis. 

&gt;a Head of State whom we share with 16 other independent countries because she is their Queen too and that links us all together amazingly and most valuably

It links us in no way other than name. She is not valuable at all, not even in the way of tourism. 

&gt;the Head of the Commonwealth because all 53 countries recognise her as this and so she is a special unifying symbol for them too the centrepiece of colourful non-political ceremonial and national celebrations

See above. You've not really said anything meaningful here at all. 

&gt;separate from the Head of Government (the Prime Minister), unlike in some countries where the two are combined, often with difficulty able to give impartial non-political support to the work of a wide range of different types of organizations, faiths, charities, artists, craftsmen etc

...that she chooses personally to work with. Right. And she's unelected. And she's our official head of state to do this. Alrighty. 

&gt;a Head of State completely under the democratic control of Parliament but not having to change every few years in divisive elections at the head of a Royal Family who can share the duties and represent the Queen

Elections can be divisive but at least that gives the public a voice. The monarchy does not. Why would it matter if our monarchy changed every few years if they do nothing of political importance as you suggest? 

&gt;a constant, lasting symbolic head of the country with links back through our whole history and assured lines of continuity into the future a worldwide well-known and respected symbol of our country carrying out State Visits and goodwill tours in other countries

You're just throwing a load of fancy words together again as if I should stand back in awe and agree on that alone. 'Symbol' in this context means nothing. 'Respect' is incredibly subjective. She chooses which visits and tours she does and does not do. And she gets that privilege by virtue of having been born to a prior royal. 

Also I wouldn't say our history is anything to be proud of at all, that's why we leave things we don't like to exactly that, history. Soon we'll inevitably do the same with our monarchy.

&gt;Obama has sworn fealty to Israel - His campaign manager Axelrod, is tied to the Israeli agent Rahm Emmanuel, the Israeli Defence Force veteran who is a Representative for a district in Chicago, who ran the Congressional Election campaign for the Democrats, and made sure that anti war candidates didn't get the support from the party.

&gt;Obama's foreign policy handler Ziggy Brzezinski thought that America needed a new Pearl Harbor to rally people to war, he got it on 9-11, when elements in the Regime and their Israeli accomplices carried out the false flag attack on America.

&gt;Rammed planes into the WTC and Pentagon, the FBI has admitted that they have no case against bin Laden for 9-11...they don''t even want him for it on their website.

&gt;They cleaned up around the Kennedy assassination...they cleaned up around the Clintons... around OKC.. these people murdered a police officer...Officer Yeakey who knew too much and was looking too closely at the real perpetrators of the April 19 attack on the Federal Building in Oklahoma City.

&gt;Look at the lowest income earners in America, the bulk of whose income goes to food, transportation and housing...the official inflation figures...like the official story of 9-11, comes from the same crock of feces.

true,ineededtostoplurking,null,null,"A Chav is not something that many (if any) people in the UK would ever aspire to be. Whether or not someone is a Chav is hard to describe. Generally people have a few things in their head that they think make someone a Chav, and if you hit enough of them, then you're a Chav. It's difficult to define exactly.  A Chav will normally be several (but not necessarily all) of the below:

* Poorly educated. The sort of person that considered school a waste of time, to the point of not trying to get any GCSEs (our end of school examinations taken at 16, after which you are no longer in compulsory education). They may even be proud of this fact.

* Disinterested in society, or engaging and contributing in any meaningful way. However often has a mild persecution complex when it comes to society as a whole. Sometimes the opposite, and has a grandiose sense of their own worth.

* On benefits, and perfectly happy to stay this way indefinitely, despite the fact that they are capable of working.

* Unattractive. Think poor diet, little exercise. Not necessarily fat or even overweight, but does not take care of themselves properly.

* Dresses poorly. Shell suits wherever possible.

* Violent, or rather: belligerent. Tries to pick a fight with people that they perceive as being at all different, or unfamiliar to them. The sort of person that would come up to you and pick a fight because they decided you looked at them funny.

* Underage parent. Had a kid very young because they are ignorant to taking steps to prevent pregnancy (or just apathetic towards it). I.e. rarely due to broken condom, normally through plain old unprotected sex.

Those are just some of the things that are characteristic of a Chav, but as previously stated, no particular one of them makes someone a Chav. It's rather intangible, you could normally tell if someone's Chavvy within a few minutes of talking to them.

**Having said all of the above** it's important to note that there are some people who are genuinely good people, who have fallen on hard times, and they tick every one of the above boxes. It's more about a person's attitude than anything else.

With regards to the Misfits scene you're talking about - Kelly **is** (more or less) a Chav.

As far as Brit cinema goes this year, my favourite is the brilliant Scottish film *The Angels' Share* despite the language barrier. Although a special mention must go to *Skyfall* and the two fantastic animated films *Arthur Christmas* and *Pirates!*.

true,ClutchHunter,english,North London,"&gt;The monarchy doesn't have enough power for it to lead to disaster.

Do they have a single right that the rest of us do not? Also I keep seeing stories about the queen out and about talking with politicians, and then there are those letters about Charles meddling in politics that he wouldn't allow to be released(I think I'm recalling all this right, feel free to correct me). 

&gt;The crown estate in (I think) the 1700's was signed over to parliament in exchange for a wage. The revenue earned from the crown estate exceeds the wage, by rougly 64p per head per year.

That's still a principle issue to me. Just take the land, it's absurd that one family can essentially own the land upon which millions live. Admittedly the one issue I find with my own beliefs regarding the monarchy is the legality of it all. 

&gt;As a British Republican you are of course free to be offended but no-one is under any obligation to change things to accommoate your offence. Personally I love having a Royal Navy, Royal Air Force, Royal Mail, OBE's, MBE's, KBE's, there is something incredibly bland about just shoving your country name in front of the word Air Force or Navy.

Right, but I was merely leveling with you in saying that you liking the word 'Royal' in front of everything should not be used as a defense of the monarchy. Equally I wouldn't use my dislike of it to try and get rid of them. It isn't a valid reason, it's a preference. 

&gt;The Monarchy cannot change their mind about the land it's written in law.

So let me get this straight... we're paying them X amount per year because a few hundred years ago they owned essentially the entire country and this is the best negotiation we could manage at the time? See, I still find issue with that principally. I personally never agreed to pay that family a thing. 

&gt;I highly trust the monarchy by comparison to the government

Honestly I think I distrust both equally. 

&gt;the queen has nothing but the countries best interest at heart

Do you know her personally? Or do you only know what she tells you in those what I find to be tedious speeches of her's? 

&gt;she isn't a sadist old woman trying to cling to power.

...because right now there isn't an enormous push to get rid of them completely. If there were she'd do everything possible to remain as she is.

Second, I'm gonna put in my two cents in about Clara. 

I believe she was born and lives in our time. The doctor after all of this takes her in the tardis and travels with her. Somewhere along the line something happens. Splitting them up, her losing her memory etc. She then is in both these places of the asylum and the 19th century London. How? Not sure yet. Why? Again not sure. But I think that might be.

My other prediction is that she linked with this ""great intelligence"" who then recreates her through out time and space to interact with the Doctor.

It's almost as though Davies/Moffat can't think of a way to make the Doctor care when a companion is in danger without there needing to be some pining love thing happening.

Even in one-off characters it's there sometimes (Voyage of the Damned, for instance, with Astrid...). It's just so overdone.

As I mentioned, the only flaw is that The Doctor seemed aware of his deletion, but as The Doctor always lies, River's comment could've been a surprise to The Doctor, and will be a small detail brought up later.

true,TexanChiver,tardis,TARDIS,"i suppose, technically, anything can happen when you regen. You can be male or female, with or without hair or appendages, old or young... So it basically falls back on a mathematical algorithm.. How many regens would you have to go through to get exactly the same Doctor that was there before? 

If you only use a few different factors, such as sex, hair color, eye color, skin tone, height and weight, then you need to calculate the probability of those reconfiguring to a state that was previously reached. Now let's say that (for arguments sake) there are only two options for each of those categories, kinda like binary has a 1/0 system... Either it's Doctor 10 or not Doctor 10..

That would mean you would have a 1:720 chance to have the same Doctor as the tenth incarnation. 

Not good chances, especially since they can only regenerate 13 times. 

Add together the multiple factors that go with all the different hair colors, eye colors, height, weight, ect.. and your chances drop drastically. I'd say anywhere between a 1:720 - 1:1,000,000 chance.. give or take.

The Doctor is smitten with her and that's obvious and perhaps the Great Intelligence (Yog-Sothoth) will use her to get to the Doctor.

The Great Intelligence becomes Oswin. Basically brought back through the memory of the anonymous people from the house, or maybe the pub. Haven't figured out that part yet. Fast forward several (hundreds) years in the TARDIS. Doctor and GI Oswin meet Daleks for the first time in Series 7. Daleks take a liking to the nightmares GI Oswin has of them. Eventually, after several series, she departs the Doctor.

She is later found to have crashed into the Dalek Asylum on her own adventures. After she ""dies,"" the GI goes back into whatever formless intelligence it was. A Dalek unwittingly stumbles upon the crash sight. The GI takes the form of a Dalek. But since the GI is linked to Oswin, she retains her memory in that form. Because she sees herself as a human, but is apparently trapped in a Dalek body, the Daleks have her chained in solitary confinement

Explains how she got that way, why she's obsessed with souffles, how she has a connection with the Daleks and why she doesn't remember her adventures with the Doctor after being his companion.

Ended up prying them out with a nail file and I was worried I might break something with the amount of force I had to use.

Second, when you extend the screwdriver, the button on the side of it no longer makes it light up and make sound. Mine's not broken or anything, it more of a design flaw. For some reason they made it so only a button on the bottom of the screwdriver works while it's in that position, and it's quite awkward to use and hold like that.

Look at all the ""potentials"" we brought into the club, how many actually made it to play regular first team football and not got shipped out? 
We need a blend of young with the experienced to actually do something in this league, look at our gypsy neighbours, they keep buying ""young potentials"", and they havent won sod all in 8 years. Do we want to go down the same route as them? I think not. And just because we ""might"" be getting Sneijder, it doesn't mean we won't go for Moutinho next season now does it?

I found this article piece on it from Wikipedia:
In the episode ""Last of the Time Lords"", the immortal time traveller Captain Jack Harkness expresses concern about how he might look if he lives ""for a million years"", because although he cannot die, he is still aging, albeit slowly. He tells the Doctor and Martha Jones that it's a matter of vanity, because as the first person from the Boeshane Peninsula to join the Time Agency, he was featured on posters, becoming known as ""the Face of Boe"". The implication of this astonishes Martha and the skeptical Doctor.

true,ClutchHunter,english,North London,"&gt;Any party that promises to hold a referendum on the monarchy is basically killing its chance at forming a government.

To be fair, I'm debating whether the people who make this so should support the monarchy or not. 

&gt;Taking money from the monarchy's budget for state functions, thereby undermining their ability to perform the job you're trying to decide if they should have, for a referendum that has no chance of passing, serves nobody's interests except those who seek to undemocratically undermine the institution.

I didn't mean that bit seriously, I was just saying how little it'd cost to do in time and money. Having said that, the money that I'd be taking away from them I never wanted to give to them in the first place. Granted that's no legal solution and it's really irrelevant, regardless, moving on. 

According to the the most royalist-favoured poll on Wikipedia at least 20% of the public want rid of the monarchy. That's a significant number. I think in the inevitable build up to a referendum more people would swing Republican than vice versa. I think anywhere up to around 40% could vote to remove them, maybe more. That would lead to further elections until eventually they're done away with. That's how I see it. As it is now the media bias is keeping them there and it's infuriating.

I LOVE the Doctor Who theme, and I want a suitably brilliant visual to go along with that iconic piece of music and really get my blood pumping. I've always enjoyed the shots of the TARDIS flying through the Time Vortex, but I was excited for a new credits scene. To me, it didn't disappoint. The combination of the dramatic horns of the previous Smith intro with some new strings (which reminded me of some Classic Who intros) and similar sound effects created a good atmosphere. I know some people criticized the random nature of the visuals, but I thought it worked well. They were wild and eye-catching without seeming too chaotic or clustered, and they were all very evocative of spacey, sci-fi imagery. The nebulae, stars, and flashes of fire and sparks...I think that's perfect for Doctor Who. For someone who's never seen Who, those titles and that theme would perfectly illustrate the nature of the show: a grand, madcap adventure through all of time and space. Plus we still got the beloved shots of the TARDIS in flight as bookends and a Time Vortex effect when the episode title popped up. All in all, I'm quite pleased.

The very last scene in Dalek Invasion of Earth is of the TARDIS key on chain Susan wore around her neck. She left it on the ground when the Doctor ditched her.

Also, with the 50th anniversary coming, there have been *lots* of references to the classic show. In this episode alone, there is the return of the face in the credits, the Doctor's costume (very reminiscent of Hartnell), the control room being *much* more like the classic sets, and the Great Intelligence (from the Abominable Snowmen and The Web of Fear).

And, of course, there have been a few references to the classic series with past episodes of 11. How he got his first costume was almost identical to Pertwee, his library card, and others which I'm forgetting right now.

This would entail Merlin's acceptance in Camelot as Court Wizard, the reign of Queen Gwen, etc. Then the audience would be drawn to the present through a set of frames where Merlin settles on the shores of Avalon after the fall of Camelot and grows old, waiting for Arthur's return.

After some google-fu and reading the poem a couple more times the whole story seems so much more tragic. 
Muir is asking Merlin if he can perform feats nobody has ever done before: rectify the original sin, outrun one's own shadow, return (""re-attach"") the forbidden fruit (apple) to the tree. Can Merlin's magic change(?) (not sure why the verb ""show"" was used) the inexorable passing of time? And the poet seems doubtful that Merlin can achieve the impossible, that he can recreate or influence time so that we can return to a perfect age of Camelot, of Eden, before sin, before death and destruction, before his friends died and Merlin was cursed with immortality.The ""Diamond of the Day"" is precisely that pristine old age of Camelot that Merlin is destined to ""inhabit"". I think it makes for a very fitting and very sad title for this last episode. One could also say that the diamond is that precious memory that we as fans will hold on to after the end.

So it makes sure its born in the Path of the Doctor after River has passed |something they didn't confirm|  So yes, my theory is that although Oswin doesn't recall it until her moments of death, she IS River Songs conscoiusness.  Doctors Last words 'Watch Me Run'Also their chemistry, she infurriates him the way River used to.  He feels comfortable enough upon their first meeting to give her a key to the Tardis.  River song gets uploaded to biggest computer, becomes great Intelligence, gets downloaded into the universe in Human bodies in the Doctors Path and becomes Oswin, or as it translates, 'friend of God'.

Was just discussing the episode with a friend and this came to my head. Enjoy! 

The Doctor at the beginning of the episode was actually a later point in the time stream than the doctor that gets to investigating. Recall that when they go up to the cloud together, the tardis is all beaten up, exactly as it was after Angels Take Manhattan. When it's first shown, the tardis is completely fine. So maybe in the beginning of the episode, he was sulking about Clara's death, not the Pond's deaths. After the episode, they have their adventures and she dies as a Dalek in Asylum of the Daleks and he comes back to warn her to ""keep her name"" because if she's Clara, she can't die as a Dalek because Oswin was the one that died as the dalek. So the Doctor is trying to prevent her death in the period where he's sulking after her death.

Whilst some things that appeal to a younger audience do cross the gap and put a smile on us older folk, its quite rare for it to do so. Plus this gap has widened over the years, as the variety of TV shows becomes greater. How many channels do we have now? Not including what we can download from all over the world if we so desire. Compared to once just 4 or 3 channels. Plus Moffat and the whole team will be under more pressure to appeal to a precise audience, an example of this is recent Doctors have even toured schools. Old doctors would never had done this. Sadly things evolve, unless you are a creationist :)

Also you may have rose tinted glasses on. Look back at the older shows. Some really were poorly written, and some had even worse acting. Lets not start about the poor sets, props and costumes. It wasn't perfect back then either, but expectations were possibly lower just like the budgets. CGI can be used today, some may debate it can distract from a poorly written script. CGI years ago meant ... well nothing. Computers were something with rubber keyboards that spotty kids used in bedrooms, they would beep, and flash as things loaded from a tape.

Doctor Who has just gone the way of Star Trek. Sad Trekkies will argue and debate for years what the best series is, and why. Who cares, just enjoy it. If not turn off, and go do something else. Just look at Doctors Whos comeback as maybe The Next Generation, rather than remaking Doctor Who of old.

Now imagine if you will that there is someone out there who **wants** the question to be asked, for whatever reason. He wants the doctor to be there at that specific time to answer/not answer the question. How on earth could this person do that? The doctor is literally the law unto himself, he might even see someone trying to help him as a trap of sorts. So what can this person do?

**Create the perfect companion.** A genius who will actually help the doctor out instead of the usual useless companion who constantly needs rescuing. Obviously you can't just find the perfect girl and hope she runs into the Doctor, so there are literally loads of them running around, or another one is sent out when another one winds up dead (could be a clone, or the flesh or whatever, the how isn't important, just the why).

true,lwang,null,null,"Man, I must be a Scrooge, because I was definitely not a fan of this episode. Just like the previous Christmas episode, and like many of this series's Moffat episodes, it's a jumble of ideas, one-liners, half-baked concepts and a distinct lack of character direction, baked into a very nice looking but oddly tasting souffle.

Break down:

1) The villain (both telepathic snow and Dr. Simeon) was terrible. Weak motivation, no real menace, no development. The snowmen had no real menace besides their opening feeding scene (which MAKES NO SENSE), as they never do anything beyond that besides appear and look vaguely threatening. Dr. Simeon has all the menace of a mannequin. He just stands about and looks like he would like to be a zombie stand-in, please. The governess might've been worth something but the terrible pacing meant she never felt like a threat to our heroes, just a sort of obstacle to move out of the way, pretty please, so we can get back to Clara and the Doctor making eyes at one another.

2) The companions. Criminally under-used. You have the Victorian Sherlock Holmes, her wife and Strax solving cases in Victorian! England! And the best you can do is have them pop up and needle at the Doctor for sulking? Why not have them attempt to solve a mystery...that leads to the greater plot, and has them facing such a threat that they break their golden rule and call for the Doctor's help? Strax did get a few good moments in, but Jenny and Vastra never got a chance to kick ass. Criminal.

3) Clara. Again, as with Karen Gillan, Moffat has a fantastic actress who can do all the right amounts of cute and spitfire...yet there's nothing else going on. Clara has two jobs for no discernible reason, falls in love with the Doctor (and whilst this is not unusual, can we change how this goes about instead of the usual?) and seems like a fairly opaque flirty tool to spark the Doctor's plug. We already did that, with multiple actresses. Let's see something else.

Now, [spoilers](#s 'the Oswin plotline does seem like a firecracker idea, so I give Moffat the benefit of the doubt and will reserve judgement on her plotline. For now.')

4) Pacing, plot, direction...shambles, shambles everywhere.

5) This episode didn't feel particularly Christmas-y, did it? 

As always, I look forward to the rest of the series, but I have to say I've lost a lot of confidence in Moffat. Maybe it's the virulent fan response, probably his involvement with Sherlock, but his scripts have lacked the same vim and bam he had in his first two. Series 5 was a gorgeous, tear-jerking, magical fairy-tale. Series 6 was pop-culture sci-fi at its zaniest. Even at his worst, his scripts were packed with wonder and amazement and as much sheer cleverness as you could pack into 40-odd minutes, so that you forgave him for his plot inconsistencies because, goddamit, he was having so much fun and you were too. 

I don't see that now. His scripts seem strangely melodramatic, lethargic. He throws out less one-liners, wallows in Smith's sad face. The zip is gone. The gloom remains. Hope he can pull himself out of this funk. And find a better writing team - it just seems like only the guest writers (Neil Gaiman, Simon Nye) are coming up with unique, inventive stories.

If that is a fair price for freedom then ignore me. But in six months more people die from firearms in the US than all the combat soldiers have died in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. To not admit there is a problem is simply to deny reality. 

With rights come responsibilities. I think a quick check of someone's gun storage as part of a licensing regime is not exactly a search and providing there were limits, say for example it could be done twice within a licensing period then I don't see that this is a great hardship. Most gun owners are responsible, right. They wouldn't want to break the law. 

The benefit of course is gun ownership is taking a lot more seriously than it is at the moment. 

The other benefit is illegal gun ownership becomes a great taboo where it is not socially acceptable to own a renegade gun and those found with them are treated harshly. ",0,1356513306,null,0,false,0,c7m9pdr,t3_15d82c,t1_c7m9pdr,t1_c7m9hua,null,1430773176,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Other things

 - It would create a pattern of the companions being family members of the doctor
 - The way Clara kissed the Doctor was very similar to the way that Amy kissed him (aggressive, he was shocked). This means that the doctor would have both kissed his mother-in-law as well as his daughter in similar fashion.
 - If Clara is the doctor's daughter then it explains the fact that she keeps living, because she can regenerate. This then leads to the issue that she keeps the same body when she regenerates. But I think that this is fine because in the first episode with the doctor's daughter (can't remember the episode number), she died and then came back to life, again with the same body. Also the Doctor didn't know that she had come back to life.
 - Lastly, it would be so classic Moffat if this did happen, and would also be incredibly exciting

EXTREME speculation

 - It is very possible that the next time we see river, she will be pregnant, if this is the case I think this outcome is even more likely. 
 - If Clara really is the Doctor's daughter, then I think either they will leave the show at the same time, or she will continue on into the series of the new Doctor, and leave shortly thereafter.

TL;DR: Clara is the doctor's daughter

That's it for me.

I don't know if a lot of people picked up on what the Doctor said at the graveyard about the Great Intelligence, namely that it ""learnt to survive beyond physical form."" You tie that into how it was trying to evolve in the first place, which was by the memories of Capt. Latimer's children of their previous governess, that explains why both times as she's dying, she tells the Doctor to remember. Not only that, the only time the Doctor has ever told others to run is when they're in danger, so we can only assume that when he eventually finds out that she's really an enemy, she'll say those words once more. Oswin/GI has really found the perfect way to survive, by being the reflection of a memory that's been implanted into someone who has lived for over a thousand years.

I notice no one's really taking sales seriously like I do in this thread, but I have thresholds for ""is it a bargain?""

Under 30% off - not worth it

Under 50% off - only if you had considered previously purchasing it (also with basics, consider buying more than one)

Under 70% off - if you genuinely like it, it fits, and you have things it would go with

Over 70% off - go nuts. You might not *love* it (but someone else will), it needs altering, you have nothing it goes with.

The End Of Time was a good episode (I'm going to count it as one for ease) and still ranks among my favourites, but looking at it from a strictly critical perspective the episode lingers far too much in the first half, then in the second half the huge cliffhanger of the first is resolved with literally a flick of the wrist. There was no point in having Donna aside from fan service and filler.

Then we have the half hour of Ten looking sad while his old companions do stuff.

But no, my biggest gripe with that episode was the fact that they threw away 5 years of character development for Mickey and three for Martha for no reason what so ever.

The End Of Time has awkward pacing. Waters Of Mars didn't. There was no deus ex machina for once and we got to see Tennant REALLY act (I say really as it was such a radical departure from his Doctors norm). So yeah.

To those who pass judgment on the killing of foxes in the country, I ask, would you not kill mice in your homes in the city? It is exactly the same. 

I disagree with getting all dressed up and enjoying oneself killing the animal, but the animals have to be killed. 


This report http://www.vet-wildlifemanagement.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=30&amp;Itemid=32 supported by hundreds of vets from the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons concludes that 'hunting by hounds is the natural and most humane way of controlling the population of all four quarry species, fox, deer, hare and mink, in the countryside'.

Just a head up, they are not massively supported, le that 600 members and not all of them are vets, their page says that 'most' are. But even so that is a tiny number. They are also heavily linked to the Countryside Alliance, a known pro-hunt organisation. 

They also supported the badger cull, despite the evidence to show that it will be ineffective may exasperate the problems. 

&gt;I imagine their opinion is of more worth and weight than myself, or anyone posting here, or anyone writing in a newspaper, or trying to sabotage a hunt.

For reasons above,  I consider their opinion really isn't worth that much weight. The bTB is laughable because it flies in the face of the microbiology, it is much clearer than the whole fox hunting debate. Of course, if the govt were not so antiquated in insisting farmers slaughter bTB positive cattle then we wouldn't have this problem. ( source, my opinion, I am a microbiologist). 

Aside from which, killing 2% of foxes is not controlling any population, humanely or inhumanely. Plus the killing is indiscriminate, there is no selection as to whether it is a dog, a vixen, or whether it is the alpha breeding pair in the area. It also doesn't take into account the urban foxes, of which 65% of our fox population are now urban. Fox territories can stretch miles, and back onto farmland, so the fox that kills the chicken on the farm may be the fox that ate left over kebab the night before. The reason foxes do so well in urban areas is because we provide them with a massive unnatural food source, rubbish. Foxes breed in direct relation to food sources, if food is scare vixens will not come into season. 

&gt;Even the best shot could not guarantee killing a fox instantaneously everytime, leaving it seriously wounded to die of infection. What other method would you use? Poison? Trapping? Hunting with hounds may seem barbaric to most but in reality it is completely different.

Better animal husbandry? We already subsidise farmers, why not ringfence some of that subsidy for fox proofing their pens/sheds. Foxes are clever, but they still lack hands and a full tool box. 

Hunting with hounds is barbaric, the fox is chased, terrified for miles running for its life because it slows down due to exhaustion and is then ripped by dogs. That is not a death that should happen to any animal. 
Besides which for the hunt there is little practical reason to repeal the law, they are rarely, if ever prosecuted, the local police generally do not want to get involved in monitoring them let alone prosecuting them. 

&gt;The whole thing has become skewed and distorted now that it has become a class issue and a reason to take a jibe at 'those fucking posh twats' and rural people see it as an attack on their livelihood by those who know nothing of their life and struggles.

That I couldn't agree with more, the balance of evidence and effectiveness has been completely distorted by the class argument.",0,1356524542,null,0,false,0,c7maori,t3_15gmeo,t1_c7maori,t1_c7mai55,null,1430773631,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

true,TheMemo,cnty-uk,Bristol,"I am getting so fucking sick of this issue.

As a guy who is currently going out with another guy, personally, I think marriage as a legal issue should be banned. That is to say that there should be no legal benefits to being married, no tax benefits and so on.

Instead, the term 'marriage' should only ever refer to a purely religious ceremony with no legal standing.

Now, as far as legal benefits (such as citizenship, inheritance and so on), these should be granted *only* to legally-sanctioned civil unions which do not discriminate on the basis of gender or sexuality. There should be no tax incentives.

The term 'marriage' should be eradicated from the lawbooks and from the conceptual vocabulary of politics and remain solely in the religious realm where it belongs. Religious people can get 'married,' and then get the legal benefits by applying for a 'legal' civil union. Everyone else just gets to have a civil union.

I don't understand the whole obsession with marriage, apart from the equality angle. If you want equality, then my plan above is the most sensible option. If the term 'marriage' is more important than that, you're an idiot. If you're gay, lesbian, transgendered, pan or bi, and you want to be married in a church, what the fucking fuck is wrong with you? Obviously, there are wonderfully accepting happy-clappy churches, but they don't seem to be all that vocal at the moment, and the overall tone of Christianity (for example) in this country is quite, quite bigoted (women priests, for example - though I am aware that it was the Laity that fucked that one). Why anyone would want to look to these people for moral guidance, I have no idea, let alone permit these fucks to enjoin you.

Unfortunately, aside from the equality angle, we have the issue of religious members of the LGBT community who are looking to the government to force their preferred religion to accept them in some way. I have massive issues with this from a religious freedom angle and from a conceptual one. 

From the religious freedom angle, I strongly believe that religions should be free and encouraged to spout whatever poisonous bullshit that they want as, aside from free speech considerations, the further they step away from the social moral mainstream, the less relevant they become to all.

From the conceptual one, religious gay people strike me as having massive cognitive dissonance or some sort of Stockholm Syndrome. Rather than religious people insisting gay people should have 'pray away the gay' therapy, perhaps gay people should insist that religious members of the LGBT community should have 'gayer than prayer' therapy.",0,1356531177,null,0,false,0,c7mbc61,t3_15gq7i,t1_c7mbc61,t3_15gq7i,null,1430773945,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

true,ostrichpotshit,null,null,"I feel like I have to say something here in response to some of the attitudes I'm seeing in this thread.

I get tired of all of the Ireland vs. England squabbling that enters into these kinds of threads. All the Irish ever wanted was self-determination. This is no longer a big deal. Cameron himself said earlier in the year in relation to the Falklands that he would be happy to allow them to self-determine.

The problem is that the geographical proximity of our islands facilitated mass plantation in the past, which has fully fucked over Northern Ireland. Unless one of the Nationalist or Unionist populations outgrows the other naturally over time, it will remain a hotbed of sectarian tension. That's saddening.

There shouldn't be so much bad blood on either side because the people of an island wanted to elect a government of their own. Irish people went into the War of Independence with heavy hearts. It was unfortunate that the cost of democracy was war, but it was a war conducted with honour. The war wasn't against British people, but against overseas rule and the atrocities that the Irish people suffered under a tyrannical rule. It's thankfully now over and I wish people would get over this uninformed bickering.

The comment in here about Irish politics proceeding ""by the bomb"" is fucking stupid. The PIRA, CIRA, RIRA, INLA, etc. have all been classified as illegal terrorist organisations by the Irish Government. They do *not* have the support of the vast majority of Irish people. People are regularly jailed for being found guilty of membership of these organisations and there is constant intelligence gathering going on against them in order to hamper their efforts. The Troubles broke out in the north and that's where the strongest support for dissident republicanism lies. It has nothing to do with modern Irish politics. The fact that the Irish government locks people up for being members of these organisations should tell you that.

I have many British friends, and Irish friends living in Britian. I hold both Irish and UK passports by virtue of being born in the UK to Irish parents. I have relations who died during the War of Independence and on both the pro and anti-treaty sides of the Civil War. I wish people would think about the complexity of our deeply entwined history before they type anything as retarded as that bomb comment. Anything the Irish have done to the British, they have paid for it hundreds of times over throughout the centuries with the blood of their ancestors. The Irish wanted a republic - they now have it and are perfectly happy to leave the past go and have friendly relations with Britain. (Except those Celtic jersey wearing halfwits who were protesting the Queen's visit. The majority of Irish people are rightly ashamed by these fucking idiots.) Ignorant comments like the ""bomb"" comment should have been removed by a moderator.

The British are entitled to their monarchy and their individual opinions of it, and the Irish still have some centuries old wounds that need to heal. Anyone who suggests anything otherwise is ignorant of history and should do some reading instead of spouting nonsense.

Unfortunately you're going to get painful bickering by ignorants on both sides whenever anything related to the monarchy comes up. I wish people would treat the subject of our shared history with the seriousness it deserves.

/rant

Apologies for getting so worked up about this, but it really is infuriating that sometimes people can be so ignorant of their history when it comes to the UK-Ireland relationship. People should think before they type.

Also, the fact that they keep dropping the ""Dr Who"" pun 3 to 5 times an episode is outrageous to me. How many seasons did they simply ignore that because its cheap and easy writing. I tried to catch up on the last 4 episodes or so last night and kept cringing every time someone said ""Dr. Who?""

With Rose and Amy (and to an extent, Donna), they introduced the female companion and then that led to a male joining in (Mickey/Jack for Rose, Rory for Amy and then Wilfred for Donna). I quite like that, because it balances things out, stops it from becoming the tale of a couple seeing the universe, and keeps it as a group of friends having adventures (which kids can relate to).

Whilst adults love it and enjoy it, the BBC are very firm about it being a family show and that means setting good examples for children, including making sure there's a gender balance.

But lets say, we win or finish second in the Premier League, get to the quarter/semi-finals/final in the EURO Cup, a decent run in the FA Cup and win the Capital One Cup, will Benitez be considered then? Lets add: Torres getting 25+ goals, more fluidity and stability in the midfield and the defense gets better. Why change that with a new manager? Why not build from the progress that already has been made? I find it hard to understand Roman very often, and I believe that we should opt for Benitez in the end, even though this seems unlikely, and I think the majority of /r/chelseafc won't agree with me here. So far so good, why start all over **if** it works out in the end of the season? Stability is key. 

Edit: I'd like to add that Guardiola has never managed in the Premier League, and it's almost a decade since Mourinho last managed in the Premier League. Firstly, seeing as they are our top contenders to take over after the summer, the team would have to adapt to the manager while the manager would have to adapt to the Premier League, leaving us at square 1.

true,TheMemo,cnty-uk,Bristol,"&gt; I would agree with you, but you have to remember that England isn't America, we don't have separation of church and state. As long as religion holds sway in government (House of Lords, Monarchy, etc) the idea that government should not hold sway in religion goes out the window.

That is a fair point. However, I have had this discussion before with others here and I rarely get a good answer to the question of how far the government should be permitted to go to ensure that religion meets the current social standards. Should religions be forced to give up the fundamental, core tenets? Should proselytising be banned because it creates inter- and intra- faith offence? Ultimately, if you take the opinion that government can force religion to behave, religion becomes completely meaningless as almost everything that makes a religion is offensive to those of other religions or non-religion (Jesus as the Son of God, for instance, is heresy in Judaism and Islam). As an atheist, I really don't care one way or another, but it would be nice to get some conceptual continuity on this from people.

&gt; . Another argument for this is that LGBT marriage isn't the end for marriage equality, polyamorous people still can't marry the people they love, and getting rid of marriage means that we don't have to do this whole ordeal again in 20 years when they start campaigning for equality.

Exactly. As a programmer, I am very much inclined to set up a framework that is open and extensible and as non-specific as possible. That way we can still stop the edge cases (such as incest unions and so on) with amendments, but polyamoury and, in the future, other unions we cannot even conceive of currently will be automatically permitted.

true,LiquidHelium,null,null,"&gt; That is a fair point. However, I have had this discussion before with others here and I rarely get a good answer to the question of how far the government should be permitted to go to ensure that religion meets the current social standards. Should religions be forced to give up the fundamental, core tenets? Should proselytising be banned because it creates inter- and intra- faith offence? Ultimately, if you take the opinion that government can force religion to behave, religion becomes completely meaningless as almost everything that makes a religion is offensive to those of other religions or non-religion (Jesus as the Son of God, for instance, is heresy in Judaism and Islam). As an atheist, I really don't care one way or another, but it would be nice to get some conceptual continuity on this from people.

I agree, I think church/state separation is the only fair thing to do and the current system is broken, just until we get church/state separation we shouldn't pretend we have it and let religion in our government but not government in our religion.",0,1356534591,null,0,false,0,c7mbtkq,t3_15gq7i,t1_c7mbtkq,t1_c7mbrcj,null,1430774154,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

1. The Snowmen may have been a decoy, or simply a test of the GI's powers, with a full-scale attack still in the works.

2. Clara may be unaware she is the GI. As mentioned above, she seems to be mirroring the Doctor. Perhaps it is gathering strength, collecting knowledge, finding its feet on this new planet.

3. Perhaps the GI is a species of which Clara is a part, but she is a benevolent one, where the one that launched the attack with the Snowmen is a malicious one.

4. The GI isn't dead, and neither is Clara. They were both put out of commission at the end of the episode, but both clearly shown to be sticking around for later episodes.

&gt;The Great Intelligence becomes Oswin. Basically brought back through the memory of the anonymous people from the house, or maybe the pub. Haven't figured out that part yet. Fast forward several (hundreds) years in the TARDIS. Doctor and GI Oswin meet Daleks for the first time in Series 7. Daleks take a liking to the nightmares GI Oswin has of them. Eventually, after several series, she departs the Doctor.

&gt;She is later found to have crashed into the Dalek Asylum on her own adventures. After she ""dies,"" the GI goes back into whatever formless intelligence it was. A Dalek unwittingly stumbles upon the crash sight. The GI takes the form of a Dalek. But since the GI is linked to Oswin, she retains her memory in that form. Because she sees herself as a human, but is apparently trapped in a Dalek body, the Daleks have her chained in solitary confinement

The Doctor's deaths tend to be traumatic events and emergencies.  There may be no practical reason he couldn't just become a female version of his same personality.

Don't forget the show is about to enter its fitieth anniversary. There's a lot of nostalgia throughout *The Snowmen*.

* We have a TARDIS interior that incorporates the colours and hexagonal wall design that existed throughout the classic series

* The intro sequence features the face of the current Doctor, a tradition starting with the second Doctor right through to the seventh

* The camera POV passes through an almost abstract and singularly-coloured cosmic display, remeniscient of the classic ""howl-around"" effect that evoled into a tunnel design and later a starfield

* The theme has had the orchestral stripped back in favour of electronic sounds like those of the BBC Radiopohonic Workshop's work on the original series

* [The enemy in this story](#s ""was a second Doctor adversary, The Great Intelligence behind the 'abominable' snowmen, aka the Yeti who stalked the London Underground of 1967"")
