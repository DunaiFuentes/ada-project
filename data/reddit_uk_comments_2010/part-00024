Regarding the effect suggestion though (FAQs has no real effect).. 1 flush for forward in time on the handle, double-flush for past.  Take the tank lid off to fix the hardware.   When traveling, the light/glow effect swirls in the air around them in a funnel, like a flush, enveloping until the toilet is gone, with gurgly noises at the end.

Yes, it's badly written (no shock there), and taken out of context this paragraph can seem to mean something different, but the surrounding paragraphs (particularly 5.10) make clear that it's not about this at all.

     Again, spoiler safety first [While many hints were dropped in the last series that River Song had/would bump off the good Doctor, Even if they include the actual event in the next series, my above point re:Matt Smith (not to mention the whole show being named after the character thing) make such a death unlikely to be a truly ""game changing"" event](/spoiler)

* Return of the Time Lords
     This by far seems the most likely to me. The return of the Time Lords at large, with all the Gallifreian rules and regulations regarding time travel. etc would definitely change the playing field for the Doctor. The only real reason I don't see this happening is because it removes the whole ""last of my kind"" aspect that has been a major component of the Doctor in all his incarnations (at least those from the new series)

* The death/victory of an old enemy (Dalek, Cybermen, etc)
     While second only to the return of the Time Lords in my opinion, I don't think it all that likely. The Daleks are, I think, under some sort of permanent clause with the BBC so that as long as there is Doctor Who, there will be Daleks so their once and for all removal from the who-niverse is a non starter. As for their triumphant victory... well that would involve wiping out all non Dalek life-forms, including the Doctor, so not really much of a series left should that happen. Same pretty much goes for the rest of the Doctor's cavalcade of villains.

Those are the first likely options that pop to mind, I had a few others when I was thinking about this earlier but damned if I can remember them.",0,1285192662,null,0,false,0,c108ubo,t3_dhcnq,t1_c108ubo,t3_dhcnq,null,1426481330,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

The human characters were actually enjoyable, and of course ELO makes some awesome music, but it would have been a better episode if it was just about people searching for The Doctor.  Keep the opening Scooby Doo-esque scene and the main character's obsession with the Doctor the same, but just make it about the human characters. 

Edit: I should add that a lot of the bad episodes usually have one element, that if removed, could make them much better.

People - particularly those who grew up trusting news organs implicitly, and then at some point had it brought home to them that the object of their trust was less than perfect - frequently confuse ""less than *perfectly* reliable"" with ""utter crap, indistinguishable from anything else that's less than perfectly reliable"".

It's a form of the [nirvana fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_fallacy), where instead of comparing a news organ to the other news organs and judging it for what it is or what you could reasonable expect it to be, they instead instinctively compare it to the naive, idealistic image they used to have of a perfect, trustworthy, unbiased news source, and then decide that because it doesn't match up to that unattainable ideal, it must therefore necessarily be ""useless"" ([see also](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_%28psychology%29#Splitting_and_Relationships)).

The net, in terms of secure networks, simply isn't a secure medium, and nor can it ever be and still remain open and free. These things will happen, especially when money-grubbing idiots invade the internet - previously the territory (and still claimed as the territory) of the egocentric disenfranchised people you are talking about.

I'm not saying this is morally right or even defensible, but it is how the internet is - and to do business over the internet and not realise this is utter stupidity. To taunt these people is bordering on masochistic. 

But, ultimately, it's just on the internet and it's just data. If that data destroys this guy's life, then perhaps he should be more careful with his communication in future. At least he hasn't had his throat slit.

I don't really see that it matters if they are or aren't equal or morally equivalent. The point is that person A sees person B doing something they don't like, so they take illegal action against them. They've stepped outside the communally and fairly objectively generated and defined rules of the society they live in (the law) and applied their own personal subjective criteria to dispense justice. Once they've done that, what right do they have to criticise someone that wants to slit their throat because they don't like what they do. Come to think of it, they're now in a subjective framework of justice, so slitting a throat and pinching emails can easily be argued to be equivalent (subjectively)

&gt; the internet, historically, was never meant to be used for business or for transmitting data securely

The streets weren't built to transport pretty, scantily clad women walking home alone after they've been out partying all night. That doesn't mean you get to rape them (well, for you it does - but that's not going to work as an excuse in front of the judge)

&gt; but it is how the internet is

In some part of the world right now some people are being sold (human trafficking) and that's just the way it is around there. They shouldn't complain. Absolutely everything is the way it is. So what? 

&gt; But, ultimately, it's just on the internet and it's just data

Your throat is just particles. In fact, those particles don't even belong to you, they came from the universe; from some star somewhere. At some level, those particles don't even exist in the conventional sense that you understand material to exist in. Given that it's all just impersonal particles person A should be able to pass the particles that happen to be in his hand (his knife) through any other particles (e.g. through the ones that happen to be gathered into the throat-shape of person B)

&gt; If that data destroys this guy's life, then perhaps he should be more careful with his communication in future.

Perhaps you should be more careful with your throat. You should probably wear some kind of protective chainmail around it so that people can't just come up to you and slit your throat. If you don't wear that chainmail then you're almost asking to get your throat slit.

Incidentally, where do you live? I don't like the idea of going around slitting people's throats but I think it would be interesting and funny to just randomly turn up at the house of someone that holds the kind of views you do (RE justification of vigilante action) and just beat the crap out of them because I disagree with their views. It'd be hilarious, in the same way that it's hilarious that ACS:Law got hacked. Also, how big are you - obviously I don't want to turn up and get the crap beaten out of me so I would need to know whether I need a baseball bat or some friends or something, or maybe to ambush you, or perhaps to beat up your mother, girlfriend or child instead because that would be safer for me ",0,1285417544,null,0,true,0,c10hl8x,t3_din2y,t1_c10hl8x,t1_c10hjmd,null,1426485429,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

As for the whole half-human thing...I always figured that it went something like this. That doctor's regeneration was particularly traumatic. The attempts to save his life were established to have borked the process, causing it to take significantly longer than it should have, which is what caused his whole amnesia in the first place. In addition to this, it's been shown that the doctor can exhibit some pretty strange and insane crazy behavior immediately after his regeneration. It's very possible that the same process caused him to become (or believe) that he was half-human, on his mother's side. 

As for the whole master thing and the central plot point...I personally like to think that it was an old lie that the Doctor had told the master during one of his crazy fits (the Master was quite prone to those) and that, in his moment of crisis, the lines between what was real and what was a lie blurred. His ""Eye of Harmony"" became a credible threat, and his feelings of deep respect and affection towards the human race translated into him becoming ""half-human"". The Master was insane, unstable and inhabiting a stolen body, with who knows what side-effects other than strange eyes. It's no stretch to think that he bought into the Doctors madness and believed the Eye of Harmony to actually be on the Tardis.

It is also very likely, given the above situation and what we know about the Heart of the Tardis, that there was a credible threat if the Master had been able to open what he thought was the Eye of Harmony. Peering into the time vortex again, it's possible he could have commanded vast powers. And that would have been dangerous. And tempting, even for the doctor. Perhaps the doctor intentionally set it so that only those who couldn't use the power properly (humans, ala Rose Tyler, who became immensely powerful, but would have burned up quickly were it not for the Doctor) could open the Heart of the TARDIS in times of great need. 

It's even conceivable that the traumatic circumstances that lead to his regeneration actually stalled or weirded the process. Humans are already fairly closely related to Galifreyans, so it's possible that he was, in essence, half-human for a while, returning to normal once the regeneration process finished a few days after the excitement died down.

People have been talking about Ed having been put over the hill by ""the unions"" or, erroneously, by ""the union block vote"" (there was no block vote), like it's something deeply sinister. And I don't get why people seem to consider it more suspect for Ed to have been elected in a vote that involved some 200,000 union members as well as 120,000 party members than it was for David Cameron to be elected in a vote by 200,000 party members alone.

I get your point about some people having both a party and a union affiliation. There's also the question of MPs having a disproportionate say - but then, the Tory leader is only elected by rank and file party members after the MPs first determined which two candidates members get to vote for in the first place. In the Labour election, party and union members get to choose between all of them. 

In both cases, at the bottom line, hundreds of thousands of rank and file members get to elect a party leader by individual vote - no smoky back rooms any more, no block votes, no top-down imposition of a new leader.

Further, if development of the current tranches of wind-power had proceeded with more certainty, the Isle-of-Wight Vestas plant would not have shut down and there would be more jobs.

£1.2 billion also sounds like a very optimistic price for a 1 gigawatt nuclear plant, given likely cost overruns.

Wind farms have the massive benefit of being deployable now, not in 5 - 10 years. Don't forget you have to add planning permission time as well. Oh and load factor will be 85 - 95 %, so your 1.2GW will be closer to 1GW.

I just got done watching Boardwalk Empires second episode as well as Dexter's new episode.

If there was some kind of legal way of doing what torrents provide i would do it in a second, but for the moment there is not.

How do you know public sector cuts won't work? 

I've worked in the public sector, and the level of waste I witnessed (pre-recession) was ridiculous. I saw thousand of pounds spent on free pens to give to the public, some employees could easily go a whole day without actually working, while 'management' spent more time sitting in meetings eating biscuits than actually managing.

I'm sorry to say that many of the people who excelled in the private sector wouldn't last a minute in the private sector.

I tend to agree with you on this, but they are two entirely different sectors that require entirely different approaches afterall.

You may be right about waste, this only means that more effort should be applied to raising efficiency. Cutting funding isn't necessarily going to reduce waste, if the waste remains then it's obviously only going to hurt the sector. Instead they should have put more effort into reducing waste while keeping the funding the same.

I wanted to go with sort of a cute, cocktail version of a Dalek.  I was picturing wearing stretch gold leggings and a stretch gold long sleeve shirt (it's cold here, and we go to an outdoor Halloween thing).  There would be two gauntlets that strapped around my wrists: one with a plunger and the other with the whisk-type-thingy.  I was planning on making the neckpiece with plastic or Chinet plates painted gloss black, and the hat would be built off a beanie (the ""eye"" on its front would have been a short tube/toilet paper tube painted black with a battery powered LED inside it and a sheet of blue vellum paper over its end to create a glowing effect).  I was also going to add some gold netting as a cocktail-length veil, just for funsies.  I was planning on doing metallic gold makeup stripes on my face to mimic the Dalek facial mesh.  

The dress would be a simple black strapless dress (purchased) with the Dalek control panel details painted on in gold.  Its skirt would actually close over the dress (right under the bust) and be made from strips of cardboard taped together and painted gold with gold-painted foam half-spheres on its panels.  I wasn't sure about the closing mechanism (I was thinking about taping myself into it, but then I wouldn't be able to use a bathroom all night); I think a large, well concealed separating zipper would do nicely.  It could be glued along a side seam on the inside of the skirt.  Long strips of velcro would also do the trick, I think.

The BBC tonight cancelled a Panorama documentary on the business and tax affairs of Lord Ashcroft, just hours before it was scheduled for broadcast last night. Click here to read more

Lord Ashcroft, the outgoing deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, continued to avoid millions of pounds in UK tax, despite his pledge to become a full British taxpayer, according to a wide-ranging investigation into his financial and business affairs to be aired by the BBC tonight.

A Panorama programme on the billionaire Tory donor was originally scheduled to air before the General Election, when Lord Ashcroft was in charge of the party’s campaign in marginal constituencies, but the corporation delayed broadcast amidst wrangling with Lord Ashcroft's lawyers, and extended the programme's scope. 

The investigation spans three countries where the peer has controversial interests, including the Caribbean tax havens of Belize and the Turks and Caicos Islands, as well as the UK. His lawyers told the BBC before broadcast: ""Our client has denied any impropriety or wrongdoing in respect of any of the matters that you have raised.""

Lord Ashcroft’s opaque tax affairs have proved a thorn in the side of David Cameron’s Conservative party, and the Panorama broadcast will ensure that the issue does not fade quietly as the peer formally steps down from the deputy chairmanship at a party meeting today.

The programme claims that Lord Ashcroft transferred ownership of one of his main companies on the eve of a new law that forces members of the House of Lords to pay tax on all their worldwide income. On 5 April, the peer moved his 25 million shares in Impellam Group into a trust for the benefit of his children. On 6 April, new legislation came into force that would have cost him an estimated £3.4m in inheritance tax.

“The billionaire businessman hasn’t broken any rules by using the family trust, but his actions appear to conflict with the coalition government’s stance on tax avoidance,” the BBC said in a press release for the programme, which airs on BBC1 at 8.30pm today.

The Independent revealed in March that plans to broadcast the investigation before the election had provoked furious protests from Conservative headquarters. Senior Tories fired off letters of protest to the director-general of the BBC, Mark Thompson, and the chairman of the BBC Trust, Sir Michael Lyons. In the end, the decision to delay broadcast was taken because Lord Ashcroft’s lawyers disputed key parts of the programme and to give the team of journalists more time to unravel his network of offshore companies.

The peer is taking legal action against The Independent over two reports on his business interests in the Turks and Caicos Islands last November.

Panorama says that British detectives working on a corruption inquiry in the TCI are looking at loans provided by Lord Ashcroft’s bank to two local politicians. The investigation started after a Commission of Inquiry headed by retired Judge Sir Robin Auld found a high probability of systemic corruption in the islands and requested a criminal investigation of five government ministers. The British government suspended the TCI constitution last year and the islands are being run from the UK Foreign Office, which is now led by Lord Ashcroft’s political ally William Hague, who nominated him for a peerage when he was the Conservative leader in 1999.

The peerage was eventually granted in 2000 after Mr Ashcroft gave Mr Hague a written promise that he would become a UK resident. For the next nine years, he refused to answer questions about whether he was a UK taxpayer, until his hand was forced two months before the General Election this year, when he admitted he was not fully resident in the UK for tax purposes and so paid no tax on his huge overseas assets.

Lawyers for Lord Ashcroft told The Independent that he denied all wrongdoing. They said they would respond to the BBC later today in respect of the allegation about UK tax, adding ""The [BBC] Press Release is fundamentally flawed, and this will be made clear to the BBC"".

We had a listed building and courtyard wall in our school.  One day a friend and I discovered that the mortar between the bricks of the courtyard wall was very crumbly.  Scratch it with a pen (or better still, a fork appropriated from the canteen) and it just fell away. In about 10 minutes we had worked a brick out of the wall.  The next day we did another.  Within a few weeks there was a large hole in the wall.  We couldn't believe that we had got away with it.  We were expecting major trouble... but nothing.

It turns out the school knew exactly who was responsible for the hole in wall, but chose to do nothing.  The school wanted the wall knocked down, but couldn't touch it because it was listed.  Until, that is, it because dangerously unstable because of all the missing bricks (thanks to us).  Then it became a health and safety issue and they got the wall knocked down.

Well, this is based on my own experience of hiring people who are usually in their late teens (for bar work). Most of these guys had poor reading skills, terrible arithmetic and a really bad work attitude. I'm not the only business manager/owner to observe this - Sir Terry Leahy of Tesco and Lord Alan Sugar have both said the same, and to me they're ten times more credible than any stat gatherer.

Regarding waste in the public sector, my girlfriend still works in local government, and they've pretty much exhausted all opportunities in terms of reducing unnecessary expenditure. 

The public sectors' real problem has come from the culture of 'managed targets' that has seen management numbers grow massively, while frontline staff have been ignored.

It sounds harsh, but to be frank the public sector can afford to lose a whole segment of deadweight employees who dont actually perform any kind of public service. I'm talking about the target managers, the efficiency monitors, the public awareness campaigners, the hugely bloated 'typing pools', the people who created and maintain those terrible local council websites, the temps who are hired on inflated wages for the convenience of having a private sector style negotiable contract and in particular the hugely inefficient contracts with SerCo.",0,1285674165,null,0,false,0,c10r1mg,t3_dirqu,t1_c10r1mg,t1_c10nvxa,null,1426489854,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Then, they end up with a toxic coal slurry which gets released into the waterways. Again, no one in the coal industry pays to clean this. We're talking about drinking water, agricultural water, tourist water; water they don't own. Then you have the cost of human lives, and the lives damaged from pollution and so on.

Chevron, for example, has been taken to court for murder but the penalties they face are so laughably small that I'm sure they think of murder as just another business cost. So you have to think about all these wasted landscapes and destroyed countries and destroyed lives before you even think about things like climate change, and peak energy.

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"Pro tip ( from a touring Live sound engineer ) don't give the O2 arena any money, the acoustics in there are some of the worst on the live circuit by far. Horrid place to see a band. 

Also as far as large live shows are going, Ticketmaster just merged with Live Nation ( who were once know by the name 'Clear Channel' a live US entertainment company with a notorious track record ) to become Live Nation Entertainment. Both companies have/had a reputation in the US of monopolising both Artists and venues to push ticket prices through the roof giving you no alternative but to buy from them. And now that they are one company, you can expect these prices to go higher. 

There is even an [anti-merger hate website](http://ticketdisaster.org/) on the subject. 

In the UK they formed 'Live Nation UK' to get around the competition laws, who bought up the Mean fiddler group ( the last bastion of independent live show promotion ) and now own Hard Rock Calling, Wireless festival, Download Festival ( part of ) Glastonbury, Reading and Leeds Festivals, everything that happens in Hyde Park, every mid to large sized London venue and most of the large main venues up and down this country. 

Now to really get your head around how this company operates, when I used to run the Quad Live venue for LSE ( London School of Economics, capacity 1500 in the main room ) we booked several large acts to play the venue over the course of one summer,  promoted the events, sold the tickets, spent a fortune, but the acts mysteriously started to pull out at the last minute. Not one for lying down down and taking bullshit I phoned one of the guitarists I personally know from one of the bands ( not mentioning any names ) to find out what the fuck was going on, only to be told that they had been pulled to one side side by a representative of ( at the time ) Clear Channel and told in not so many words that: Play that gig and you don't get to play another show in London again. Period. 

So, fearing their careers as live bands, they all pulled out. 

We lost a fortune. 

WTF!

We did try and work with Clear Channel for a while, but found their methods to be completely ""Hands in the till"" We promote the gig, we get the artists, we take all the money, you get a percentage of the bar take. It was like, hold the fuck on a minute here, we own the fucking venue, not you? So they moved on... and left us with a huge central London venue, smack bang in the middle of Holborn where nobody would ( or could ) play. 

So that in a nutshell is who Ticketmaster are, i.e. US corporate bullshit with their predatory business tactics and methods invading our country and monopolising our live music scene and culture. 

As the Americans are so found of saying: Go fucking figure. 

**TL;DR** Ticketmaster are a bunch of cunts. 


Edit: Oh and while I remember, Live Nation also have an exclusive deal with Carling Lager ( so shit it actually sobers you up ) so if you're looking for the reason as to why UK festivals only ever serve shit beer nowadays, this is it.
