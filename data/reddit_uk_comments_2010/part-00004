Note to the OP - If you haven't finished watching all the classic series, the audios contain a lot more classic references and meditations on older stories to give them a better place in canon. This doesn't mean that you won't enjoy them, it simply means that your appreciation of them will improve with your knowledge of classic Who. The audios have excellent replay value.

true,brownpartyboy,null,null,"In my opinion there is a public interest argument relating to individuals' right to know, even before considering the the Bulger family's interests. These two individuals, throughout the process, have received protection at the expense of the tax payer in order to protect them from recriminations owing to the particularly heinous nature of the crime that they committed. Now, I fully understand that such protection is in accordance with UK and EU law and is necessary in respect of the rule of law, especially considering that both have served their sentences. However, for the Bulger family I personally believe there is a legitimate interest for them to know why one of the individuals who brutally murdered their child, and has had the benefit of a 'new life' (public expense), has been returned to prison. If I were in their position it would anger me that, despite serving a relatively short sentence in comparison to the crime committed, the perpetrator has been returned to prison; this is with regards the prison system (which has obviously failed this individual from the perspective of rehabilitation) as well as the knowledge that Jon Venabales, who  committed the murder, despite being given a real second chance in life has once again broken the law and been returned to prison. Therefore, I think their right to know stems from the idea that despite the allowances afforded to Jon Venables, his actions, and the knowledge that he is enjoying life and continuing to breach the rules of his release would engage a right to know exactly what he has done; both for the family and the wider public interest.

true,brownpartyboy,null,null,"I am not suggesting that recriminations are a part of the process of justice. Not in the slightest. The role of the justice system is not retribution. My point is that they are able to take advantage of long standing principles and legal precedents necessary for the proper functioning of justice in a democratic society. When I talk of privilege, I do not mean privilege *de jure* but  a *de facto privilege*; a corollary of the fact that these crimes were committed in the UK where we have a well develped legal system that enshrines within it certain rights, obligations and duties upon both the authorities and the perpetrators of crime . It is the *law*  that actively protects these individuals (the killers) from vigilantisim  , whether stemming from the wider public or otherwise. Whether or not such action is deserved is a moral/ethical judgement and the law is rightfully silent on this matter. 

As I mentioned in my comment above: 

&gt; If they are to benefit from the protections enshrined within the legal system I think **they should also be subject to an element of scrutiny so that they cannot be seen as 'getting away' with what they have done, which, is a viewpoint I can empathise with**. 

My intention here is that I can understand that many people would be angry to hear that the killers have not only had the opportunity to start their lives over, but that they have chosen not to act within the strict confines of the terms of their release. The law has afforded them every opportunity to start a new life, despite *paying their price* to society by virtue of their incarceration. They have been given new identities. New places to live. Yet, despite this, one of them has chosen to act in a way that contravenes these allowances, and for the public to maintain confidence in the system I believe it should be subject to scrutiny, and by covering such information up, it is difficult, nigh on impossible, to make an informed decision as to their effectiveness. 

I *do not* think that public harassment is an acceptable part of an offenders life after leaving prison, and do not believe any of my comment would suggest that this is the perspective I have adopted. My comment is limited to the idea of the public interest in the knowledge of the actions of such high profile criminals subsequent to release. 

Perhaps this is best illustrated by way of example. If it was your child/sibling/parent that had been brutally murdered, and you knew that those who committed the crime had been provided with a new identity and had been rehoused at public expense subsequent to their time spent in incarceration. Would you not want to know whether or not that person, who has effectively been provided with a new life that does not *prima facie* carry with it any obvious evidence of their history, feel aggrieved that they had been allowed to commit further crimes, or even to be allowed to partake in a 'normal' life in lieu of the crime that they have committed?

That sounds great and all but :

&gt; The images are then cross-referenced against the national fingerprint collection of 8.3 million prints.

According to [this data](http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme5/trendsfatalcar76.pdf) there were 1,106 car drivers and 557 passengers killed in the UK in 2005 (a falling trend btw.). I couldn't be bothered finding the number of pedestrians so lets just round up to 2000 fatalities. Lets pluck from thin air 3000 unconscious or incapable people to make a nice round 5000 injured people unable to identify themselves per year.

From the figures : 13% of the 5000 will be in the fingerprint db - 691 people, 20% of those driving their own car leaving 553 people per year who can't be identified at the scene.

In 2008/9 there were 648 homocides. I can't remember many cases where the victim is unidentified pretty quickly - 13% of that is 84

1660 + 252 = 1912 over three years = £4707 per person - MINIMUM.
Assuming NONE of them carried any form of ID.

So lets pretend its about finding your mum when you have a face full of windscreen.

Dorset has a lot to see . 

England takes a bit of time to get to know - to find out where to go . I find the best way is to get 'lost' then discover some interesting countryside . Also driving through areas - such as past Runcorn or over the Peak District . Country walking - rambling - is great .

Mostly I can recommend you find some decent studenty pubs, and try some local drinks and food, if you have any interest in food, I highly recommend you find a decent gastropub in Scotland and try some haggis, it is delicious with a dram of whisky.

Saving money:

If you don't have a car: you should try and book travel now to get the best prices.

Stay in youth hostels and/or B &amp; B's, much more character than a travel lodge, if you ask nicely a B &amp; B owner will probably make you sandwiches for day trips, and if in a hostel you should have a kitchen to make your own.

Try not to pay for anything; it has about a 30% markup from the rest of Britain, stay somewhere about an hour away and bring in food and drinks for day trips.

If you're only staying a short time stay in Scotland. There's plenty to do.

For Edinburgh, you should see the Castle, but head up between Monday to Saturday and check out the view from the battlements at around 12:30. Stick around for half an hour, that's all I have to say on the matter.

On the same road going up to the castle is a ridiculously cheesy [Whisky adventure tour](http://www.whisky-heritage.co.uk/). Please don't take it seriously, it's not a substitute for doing the islands where they make Whisky (if you're into it) but it is a good way to kill a couple of hours and try some good whiskys and (if you pay attention) learn a little about how it's made.

There's also a pub a bit further down on the left that serves traditional scottish ""heavy"" ale, but there's lots of pubs around. If you get the chance try Innis and Gunn, it's made using Whisky barrels and has a distinct taste.

Around Princes street is good for shopping and wandering around. behind Princes street are a bunch of great places to eat.

[Celidh Culture](http://www.ceilidhculture.co.uk/) starts in a couple of weeks and might offer you something a little different. There's lots of events on so it's worth seeing if there's anything that might take your fancy. The [Cadies and Witchery](http://www.witcherytours.com/) tour is supposed to be a good Ghost hunting tour, although there are quite a few. If you want to get out of Edinburgh try the [Afternoon Tea tour](http://www.afternoonteatours.co.uk/tours/afternoon-tea.html) or a [Scottish Castle tour](http://www.afternoonteatours.co.uk/tours/castles-gardens.html).

If you're feeling energetic, [Arthur's Seat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur%27s_Seat,_Edinburgh) is an extinct volcano in the middle of Holyrood park, about a mile east of the castle. [The Royal Yacht Britania](http://www.royalyachtbritannia.co.uk/) was the official Royal Yacht for 40 years and is open to the public. The [Georgian House](http://www.nts.org.uk/Property/56/) is a well-preserved traditional Edinburgh house from the Georgian period.

The Scottish National Portrait gallery is a free gallery that has a few nice paintings. There's also the [National Museum of Scotland](http://www.nms.ac.uk/) if you fancy something like that.

The [Camera Obscura](http://www.camera-obscura.co.uk/) is an odd one-off, but could be worth a look.

Edinburgh has a load of excellent pubs and restaurants. Try to stay away from anything that looks like a chain, I'm sure your girlfriend will know a few places. [Time Out Edinburgh](http://www.timeout.com/edinburgh/) should be able to give you a few pointers if you get stuck.

If you're staying more than a week, you might want to try the North of England such as York, Leeds or Manchester. York is a very traditional English city. Leeds and Manchester are very modern, Manchester is pretty much the London of the north and also home to Manchester United Football Club (in nearby Salford).

If you're around for more than two weeks then it might be worth staying in London for a weekend. If you book far enough in advance you can get cheaper tickets to and from London and cheaper accomodation. If time's not that much of an issue you can get to london on the [National Express](http://www.nationalexpress.co.uk/) coach service, which is slightly better than a Greyhound. Flights to London are occasionally cheap if you pick the right airport and the right flight, but bear in mind that of all the London airports only London City airport is actually in London and it's sometimes more difficult to get to central London from London City than the other London airports! If you can't book accomodation early try [Laterooms](http://www.laterooms.com) for hotels and [TripAdvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.com) to make sure you won't get a bad deal.

I hope that gives you some food for thought and helps out and I hope you and your girlfriend have a lovely time in Scotland (and possibly England).",0,1268001944,null,0,true,0,c0lrnna,t3_bacoh,t1_c0lrnna,t3_bacoh,null,1426235063,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

No. And copy/pasting the surrounding scene doesn't explain or prove your point. I'm not saying Othello is being robbed of his money (for one thing this line is spoken by Iago, not Othello). Iago is hypothesising about the difference between someone robbing you of your spare change (ie, trash) and someone robbing you of your reputation. 

The dramatic irony here is that he's saying that taking away someone's reputation is a crime from which no one profits, but the audience however is acutely aware that this is exactly what Iago is doing to Othello.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I think there is no place for a personal vendetta in our legal system, and that is what Denise Fergus is on.

This isn't about a vendetta, she wanted at least a 15 year stretch for them both when they committed the crime. Quite rightly as well given the situation.

&gt; She has no right to know, there is a reason grieving parents are not involved in prosecuting their children's murderers.

Sorry, but it's a matter of public record, end of story.

&gt; What happened to her child is unspeakably evil. The fact it was done by 2 10 year olds makes it worse. But listen to the tapes of the killers after they were caught, they sound exactly like what they are, scared, confused little kids who had no real grasp of what they had just done. I am certainly not defending them, but I am standing up for their right to not be hounded by this grieving lady.

I'm not sure which part of the country you are from, but I am local to where it happened; and I went and watched the entire court case from the public dock. 

Let me explain a few things regarding your statement about scared confused kids. The media has only really reported the brutality of the crime, never the full on details (thank fuck). What those *scared* little boys actually wanted to do was kidnap a kid and throw them out in front of a car. 

What they ended up doing was kidnapping a 2 year old toddler, took him two miles away to a disused railway track, tortured him over a few hours, smashed him round the head with an iron or steel bar (I can't remember which), hit him with bricks repeatedly, poured paint on his face, put batteries in his mouth and then finally laid his dead body across a train track and put rubble all over his head to weigh him down so it couldn't move; the idea behind this was to make it look like an accident. A train later cut him in half. 

All of this is not something a pair of scared little boys do and they were more than aware of there actions, the entire thing was purposeful. I'm sure they were frightened by the time they were getting interviews, I'm sure anyone would be after committing those types of crimes.

Venebles stood smiling in the dock for most of the trial. He was more so the leader and this is a reason than Thompson hates him, not too mention that Venebles tried to lay the blame on him entirely, again that's not something that someone without purpose does.

They both served 8 years in a kid prison and not one day in adult prison, were given brand new identities at a cost of 250,000 quid each to the tax payer. That's more than some people earn in a decade.

&gt; The worst thing that could happen is a lynch mob, either inside or out of prison, it would be a major set back for this country in the same way the pediatrician incident was.

What already is a major set back for this country, and its legal system, is the entire shambles of only 8 years and releasing them with new identities. The entire situation already proves that.

I'm not sure how old you are, perhaps you're not old enough to remember it properly etc. The majority of the country never agreed with the release conditions, it's unheard of and he must now face the legal system for the crime(s) he has committed and also the breaking of his license, again it's a matter of public record and his new identity must be revealed and the justice system should be held accountable for a failed experiment because it is in the public's interest.",0,1268075859,null,0,false,0,c0ltg6h,t3_band7,t1_c0ltg6h,t1_c0lstwh,null,1426235905,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

A tax that even if you don't have a TV you're harassed and hunted down. A tax that the BBC will deliberately expand into new areas such as streaming over mobiles, so that they can claim that if you have a mobile you owe them their tax.

The BBC is many things. A provider of good content, yes. A provider of poor content that would shame Channel 5 - Cash in the  attic, step right up. It is not your friend. Your friend doesn't demand £140 a year and then send you threatening letters if you stop paying attention to them.

The other thing is that over the last decade or so the BBC has expanded massively, not always for the good. Sure, there's a lot of people talking about BBC 6 but what about the Asian network, that spent as much money as Radio 1 per hour to entertain a fraction of the people? There is room for cuts and for these cuts to be passed on to the taxpayer. The current maneuvres are rearranging deckchairs on the titanic by making minor cuts so that when the inevitable comes they can claim, ""But we've already been saving money, your cuts will hurt us."" - This is the reason why the BBC has a strong liberal bias, because conservatives will want to cut funding.

Reduce the remit of the BBC and you reduce the cost. Reduce it carefully, taking into account the requirement to entertain, educate and innovate and you bring the BBC back to what it once was and no longer a threat to commercial media.

I welcome the decision to refocus the BBC on quality, not quantity, but think it needs to go further - stick Don't get mad, get dom on ITV. I want more natural history docs like Planet Earth. Fuck Heroes, let sky have it. Give me The Thick of It.

He has his basic human rights, as laid down in the human rights act*, including the right to a fair trial. Vennebals has not been charged with anything. His lawyers believe that he will not get a fair trial if details are leaked to the press now. Much as it pains me to say Jack Straw was right to agree with them, I think he was. 

Now the important part: **If he cannot be given a fair trial, he cannot be convicted, and will have to be released.** If he is released to the mob he will be torn limb from limb because of the barely thought out emotional responses of people like you (and worse - you're reasonably civil). 

Two wrongs do not make a right, this is the primary reason why I don't want a full blown armed revolution. 

Once this is all over, then yes, all the details should be released. And if it turns out that whatever the accusations are are not true, then Vennebals new identity must be protected to avoid the mob justice mentioned above. also he should demand that the IPCC investigate the leaking of what has been leaked so far, and very possibly fire the police responsible (perhaps out of a cannon).

What if he's found completely innocent of any new crimes? Why would we hold a big investigation about licensing and 'how could this happen' and so on if he actually hasn't done anything wrong?

You're walking a _very_ shady line of assuming he's guilty, and basing your views of what should happen from that. That is _not_ how a just society works.

If the details of his crime (not his new name) were to be released, as it should be under current law because his identity is what is protected not his actions, and he was found innocent then what's the problem here? 

If you want to talk and bang on to me about legal process then answer the above. Explain to me the area of his release that protects that information. 

It's people making your argument that are walking the shady line of non-transparency and secrecy when it comes to the law. Is that something you want or believe is fair to the rest of society?

I've had plenty of years to come to the conclusions I have. At the time, yes I was outraged and saddened that two young lads could do something so horrific, I felt for Bulgers Mum, the stuff I heard and saw in court is not something any mother ought to, ever. However, I am a firm believer in the law and that law mustn't ever be subverted by the powers that be or it sets dangerous new presidents. That happened in 2001, that was bad enough and a lot of people are seemingly forgetting that; again I will state that crimes that are committed and people that are arrested are subject to the public domain; nobody has the right to interfere with that process (otherwise they are interfering with a process that you yourself are trying to defend) - __none of society is above the law__.*",0,1268139887,null,0,true,0,c0lv5qk,t3_band7,t1_c0lv5qk,t1_c0lv25p,null,1426236717,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I've seen this myself in the assignments my sons bring home.  They are typically given a short passage to read (maybe a page of prose, a short technical article, or a poem), and then compose a 1-2 page response to it.  This is designed to mimic, rehearse, and perfect the conditions under which they will be tested.

However, this does **not** mimic the real world, in which people may actually have to spend hours or days piling through whole volumes of material.  In the last year, I've never seen my 14yr-old bring home an assigned novel to read; not one.  I don't worry about this myself, because he reads plenty of his own books, but I do note the difference from when he took English courses in America.

This set is great for completists and ""Who-storians"" (it came out last month where I live) but might be one of the worst ever jumping-on points for classic Who. The commentaries are really fun - Barry Letts, Katy Manning, Terrance Dicks and guests all seem to get on really well. There's some great anecdotes from Barry and Terrence (Terry Nation's champagne habit!) and a great fondness for the show exudes from Katy.

Frontier in Space has great costuming and some prescient touches about the future, but is a tad slow. Planet of the Daleks is ridiculous, but fun in places. The first episode, where Jo pretty much performs a one-woman show while the Doctor is unconscious, was quite gripping!

The Ogrons could be revisited in new Who quite well.  With a little bit of evolution (eg. brains), these guys could be pretty scary. They looked great in their original stories. The Doctor rarely comes up against brute force that can't be reasoned with.

It did take 48 years *from the start of motorway building* to provide this link. I think that illustrates the point i was making almost as well as had it not existed. Also no east coast motorway link exists (this effects Newcastle as well) and there is still no complete motorway link between Edinburgh and the south.

Now we're running these things ourselves, in Scotland, hopefully thinks will get better - the A1 down to the border has been widened as much as it can be - but once you get to the border your screwed again as there doesn't seem to be any desire to continue these improvements on the English side.

true,robosatan,null,null,"&gt;Labour, Conserative, Labour, Conservative. It's a big 2 party cycle that has proven it isn't constructive for the people. A lot of people would agree Labour have done little but screw up our country. We're stuck in ""peacekeeping"" missions in countries we illegally invaded and they were in power during the largest financial meltdown in 50 years. In summary their financial and foreign policies are dire, why are they leading the country?
&gt;
&gt;The consevatives. This name is to be read as conservative in public spending and interest, sure they'd like to lower taxes and improve laws for businesses but lets question why. Well, it basically boils down to the fact that all their friends run all the major companies in the country and that's where their interests lie. Lower taxes for the rich, cut public spending to compensate and give businesses more freedom to hand out subprime mortgages and loans to run the country in to the ground. Don't believe me? Then feel free to read up about the parties history.
&gt;
&gt;So what choice do we have? Green? Bunch of hippies that will run the country in the ground for their own unrealistic save the world agenda. BNP? They're nazi's, the multi-racial communities we live in are a product of our foreign policy a few of hundred years ago, back then we all but ran the world. Liberal Democrats? Serious party with no obvious outside interests, nobody expects them to get any large amount of power so right now corporate lobbyists won't be interested in paying them off. They also have a fairly well established network of local parties that would help feed back up to parliament. They are a serious contender to the two party, Labour and Conservative machine our votes have submitted to in the past.
&gt;
&gt;Now personally, I cannot bring myself to vote for Labour or Conservative. They don't parallel my voice. I don't know if the Lib Dems will do any better, but what I think we can do is speak with our votes, force the government to listen to us rather than give us false promises that they never intend to follow. For this reason I will be voting Lib Dem on election day, I appeal to you to consider doing the same.

I am thinking about the word ""education"" in terms of it being a part of the system of indoctrinating people. So I did not mean that you could learn too much physics or engineering or even ""business-studies"". What I meant is that you can be over-inculcated into the ways of the ""system"". 

Anyway, the post here refers to FUCKING THE SYSTEM not ""let's all participate in the democratic process to vote in Lib-Dems"". FUCKING THE SYSTEM implies some sort of revolutionary attitude, armchair or otherwise. 

By the way, I think armchair Anarchism might be one of the most effective types (although younger Anarchists tend to disagree). Opting out of the machinery of modern society could bring about real change if enough people decided to do it, especially if they tried alternative ways to organise while they were at it. There might be the potential for a non-violent revolution.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"Drinking and driving is just bad, m'kay.  That said, this law is absolutely pathetic.  

&gt; The government believes the tougher law on alcohol would prevent up to 65 deaths a year and a further 230 serious injuries in car accidents linked to drink driving. 

Woop-de-fucking-doo!  65 deaths!  

I don't mean to make light of it, but 65 deaths is a drop in the ocean of the damage caused by *all* kinds of dangerous driving.  And let's offset that potential saving of 65 lives against the few thousand people who could lose their driving license, job, wife, family, whatever because they had 55mg of alcohol in their blood stream instead of 50.  But hey, 55mg is **DANGEROUS** (you terrorist!) but 50mg is **SAFE**.

Sorry, but it's not the people with between 50-80mg of alcohol that are the danger to society.  It's the people who drive while totally shitfaced who are the real problem.  This is a law designed to catch some easy fish so the government can be seen to be doing something, without actually doing anything useful.

The conservatives would like to cut taxes and then reem healthcare, education and programmes for the unemployed. I mean the vast majority of them can afford private healthcare, schooling and from families that are well connected enough to rarely find themselves unemployed for any great length of time.

The tories also propose a corporate tax cut. So while we're paying out masses of cash in stimulus packages the tories propose we cut back one of the methods they'll pay us something back.

Also, the LD's do propose tax cuts. However the LD's propose the tax cuts on the first £10k you earn.

true,Keros,null,null,"Firstly, I think that there are too many party cronies who get into the Lords simply because they were MPs or Ministers. I'd prefer a more selective approach based on whether they did a good job in their role. I have no objection in principle to some former MPs getting in, but the proportion right now is just silly. 

I also think that another problem with the Lords is the threat of the cash-for-amendments scandal again; and it's interesting to note that all of those who were implicated in the scandal were ex-members of an elected legislature. Once again, I would like to think that the Appointments Commission could help sort that out, along with some of the stronger measures against illegality which are going through parliament now.

Another problem is selective experience. As good as the current arrangements are (certainly compared to our elected House), there are gaps in expertise and in experience. Giving the Appointments Commission a bigger role in choosing peers could accelerate the filling of these gaps.

Some problems, of course, can't be solved simply by ensuring the choosing of peers is done impartially. For a start, peers' expenses needs to be fixed, and while a start has been made, more needs to be done to make things clear and transparent.

Another that can't be solved by the Appointments Commission is increasing the attendance rate of cross-benchers; while many of them work more behind the scenes, their voting power in the chamber itself is much reduced by their relatively low attendance; partly this is understandable because they might not feel entirely comfortable debating and voting on a subject they don't feel knowledgeable in, but that's what debates are for.
