The EDL, for all their daft racism, are touching on concerns that mainstream politicians are too scared to start a debate on:  Islam does not distinguish between religion and the state: morality is the law and the law is morality. This is in direct contradiction to the West, with its separation of religion from the state. The glaring question then is how to ensure that the acceptance of Islam in our society does not lead to a parallel system of values and laws that are incompatible with our notions of individual liberty and tolerance and the separation of church and state?

I was blogging this last night (and remember, I was drunk at the time), so I spent a little time tidying it all up this morning, and finding out some facts about the UK performances.  You'll have to forgive me, I've copied this pretty much verbatim from the aforementioned blog, so it rambles rather.  You'll also have to forgive the fact that I'm an unashamed fan of the dreadful contest. 

The last time the UK won the Eurovision was back in 1997 when Katrina and the Waves performed. Please note that Katrina and the Waves formed in the early 1980's, and had had some not inconsiderable success, internationally as well as in the UK prior to the contest. Lena from Germany, while still young, has also had amazing success, with, I believe 3 songs already charting in Germany and internationally! I was surprised to find that there even IS a Wikipedia page for [Josh Dubovie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Dubovie), who's career to date seems to consist of rejection letters from such illustrious shows as The X Factor, and Britain's Got Talent.

In fact, remembering some of the commentaries from The Lovely Terry Wogan, I seem to remember that quite a few of the bands/performers on the show have been huge celebrities in their own countries. While I'm fairly sure this was a point of ridicule for our esteemed presenter, I really don't think it's a point that can be ignored.

In fact, a little search round the interwebz reveals the sad truth. The **only** UK band to have been formed specifically to sing in Eurovision and win were Bucks Fizz. Now, this kind of luck has undeniably happened - Bucks Fizz beat an already established band (and another made-for-Eurovision group) to be allowed to take their song into the contest. Hardly luck, really. Some of the band were already singers in their own rights (indeed, Sheryl Baker had already been to Eurovision once with another band 4 years earlier), and they were all recruited by audition.

The first time a song from the UK slipped below single figures in the final rankings was back in 1978 - a totally forgettable song called Bad Old Days. After that, though, there was only one occasion (1987) when the UK slipped out of the top 10 until 1999. And do you know, the British public is so self-effacing that this is, in fact, good enough for us.

I remember hearing, while watching ""Eurovision: Your Country Needs You"" earlier this year (what, maybe 6 weeks ago, max) that Pete Waterman thought the Boy/Girl band (and I really am sorry, I don't remember their names, or which SAW song they sang) didn't seem to sing well together, and a comment from someone else that they'd had only a few weeks to practice together.

The law in the UK has not altered to account for Islam. The only parts of sharia implemented in the UK are on a voluntary basis between those who choose to be bound by it and only in civil matters. It is one of the vital freedoms the UK has that we allow people a great deal of leeway in resolving civil issues before the law is invoked directly.

The fact that some Muslims are using this freedom seems to be the target of most of the 'no sharia in the UK' arguments.

So, before the events of the telemovie, the Doctor had always been pure Gallifreyan.  After the regeneration (which didn't quite go smoothly), he had always been half-human.  This continued to be the case all the way up to the EDA novel *Interference - Book Two*, although it may have flickered back and forth between that point and the Last Great Time War.

After the LGTW, the Doctor had once again *never* been half-human, although he implicitly still remembers making the claim.  One of the IDW 10th Doctor comics specifically refers to this plot detail as a trick the Doctor used to fool the Master, and various flashback footage has reiterated that the events of the telemovie are still considered to have happened.

Printer Freezer 
Paper X-acto Knife

How to: Find a picture of a Tardis and alter it with stenciling in Photoshop Or just do this one: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_LbqntTlUPgY/SFFlmpdfIdI/AAAAAAAAAcs/1sSG8m-asjQ/s400/tardis+tshirt+template.gif

(Also pre-wash the shirt no dryer sheets or fabric softener) Take freezer paper, and cut it to fit in your printer.

*Print out on the non waxy side.

*Take an X-acto Knife and cut out the black parts of the stencil (this can be very time consuming and detailed. I recommend taking your sweet time if you want it to look nice)

*Once done place the stencil where desired on the fabric, and iron.
The wax will adhere to the shirt (and wont harm it)

*Sponge Fabric Paint onto area, and you will have to go over 3-4 coats Make sure you do this semi quickly.
SLOWLY Take off stencil while paint is still drying (it will begin drying quickly but it's easier to take off when paint is still not completely set)
Let the paint set for at LEAST 10 hrs. Although I do a full 24 for good measure.

*Turn Shirt inside out, and wash with cold water :)
(I found a site when I did this that had instructions, but can't find the site :( but these instructions are all from memory, and worked out fine for me!)

I know many didn't like RTD, and found his doctors to be slightly over the top, but I at least FELT something then, about the events and the characters. Nothing this series has moved me. There seems to be a disconnect, perhaps purposeful, from everything that came before. I don't expect Moffat to carry RTD's torch for the rest of history, but some reference to (and reverence for) the things which came before might be nice. Eleven is just so frantic, disconnected. Amy is unrelateable and also unmoved by the wonderful things happening around her. The closest we got to a well-rounded character was Rory, and we see what happened to him. 

I just feel as though Moffat is trying to make S5 a perpetual ""Blink"", and it's all so self-congratulatory and ""Hey, look at this! Look! It's a clue, and I'm going to keep hitting you over the head with it so that you're holding your breath for this ~amazing~ thing which I will eventually reveal because I'm so clever!"" and that just does not sit well with me. 

Part of the reason that I love Doctor Who so much is because it made me FEEL things. Joy, sadness, wonder, amazement, curiosity, happiness, amusement-- all of that in abundance. It's a show that had HEART, and now, I feel, it doesn't have much of it, and that's a shame. I feel as though I'm constantly trying to give myself reasons for liking these people, but there just aren't many there. 

I still watch the show, of course, and I enjoy it from the detached perspective that one might watch a sporting event. It's amusing, but there's nothing more there.

When he's left in charge in The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood, he comes off (to me, at least) as fairly confident, if a bit frightened.

Also, when we see Mickey in Army of Ghosts and Doomsday, he seems pretty confident in his abilities as an alien fighter. Same thing in TSE/JE.

I can't figure out if I actually make any sense, but the wibbly-wobbly model makes a lot of sense to me.
