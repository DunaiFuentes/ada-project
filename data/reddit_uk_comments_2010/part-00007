Proudest Moment: The triumphant return.

When fandom goes too far: Cosplay as normal dress (I admit it.  I've worn my scarf regularly during the winter)

Awesome episode to kick off the new Doc. I'll try to concentrate on the ep itself and not the preview at the end (but OH MY GOD THAT WAS COOL.)

I think Matt Smith has managed to find his way into the part pretty easily, although I think he seems to have been trying to emulate Tennant a bit, although I'm sure that will lessen as the series progresses.

I liked the things he showed the world leaders to prove he was a genius. I would love to see the episode with Fermat in it, although I can't imagine that being particularly interesting to non-mathsheads.

I loved the whole sequence where he just says ""Do you know who the *fuck* I am"" to the aliens (the name escapes me already, maybe we'll see more of them) by showing all the past doctors and then stepping through the hologram. AWESOME.

Interesting to see a setup for a story arc in the introductory episode, I wonder if they'll resolve that first, or leave it 'til later, and I wonder if we'll get a new ""bad wolf"" this season.

Smith and Moffat did a great job establishing 11 (especially with the hologram sequence). I don't know why but he really reminds me of Pertwee who was probably my favorite classic Doctor. However, I hope the ""dickishness"" he showed with young Amy was just a side effect of regeneration because that bugged me a lot. 

Amy was alright but has a lot of room to grow. Most companions seem to grow into the ""children of time"" role gradually so I'm not too worried. I hope the wedding isn't a major plot point though. The Rose/Mickey relationship was irritating, I don't want to sit through another love triangle. 

Loved the steampunk Tardis, although I wouldn't mind the background colors being tweaked a bit. The multicolored lights were a bit distracting when I was trying to take in everything. It's awesome that we seem to be in for a ""full glory"" Tardis. I'm not sure where the theory that 9/10's was incomplete due to Time War damage, but it'd be nice if they run with that and show the interior more. I think we only saw one other room (wardrobe, Christmas Invasion) in 9/10.

What was the deal with the hacker/laptop guy? I didn't catch who he was.

The crash opening was a bit lame and I don't know how I feel about the new opening, although I do like the new logo and font choices. ",0,1270340163,null,0,false,0,c0nfwbv,t3_bm2hb,t1_c0nfwbv,t3_bm2hb,null,1426263361,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

US viewer here. I thought this was a kids show? 

1. Old Amy/Amelia Pond's legs/uniform

2. Amy being a kiss-a-gram  

3. Laptop porn surfing

Kids: Mummy, what is he watching on the laptop?

Mummy: Be quiet and take off that gas mask.

When I looked up kiss-a-gram on youtube, i got [this, nsfw](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HythFJxnASE). Overall, I liked it. I liked the humor, esp from the boyfriend. I thought the acting was bad in the beginning scene with the child Amy, but got really better later on when the action started. The Doctor's humor and mannerisms got better, too. He still needs to work on it though to appear Doctor awkward and not just awkward awkward (esp the duck pond walk and the twirl in the Tardis). 

What makes or breaks it, however, will be the writing. As long as them don't dumb it down, it should be fine.

The same applies to sexuality and the same applies to B&amp;Bs because they have *chosen* to open a B&amp;B and therefore offer a public service.

If they don't want to have to cater to everyone who might want to use their service in a fair and legal way then they shouldn't be running a B&amp;B.

Unfortunately I think there's a very good chance that they might win the next general election- despite their recent efforts to throw away their lead in the polls. If that happens we'll get to see them in their true light. Sadly it will be far too late by then.  
I think the best situation would be if there was a hung parliament and whichever party ended up forming the government did so as part of a coalition. Whether that's Labour with the Lib Dems or the Tories with the assorted nationalists and Unionists, then hopefully having to cater for the junior partner in the coalition would help put the brakes on some of the more harebrained schemes that both parties seem hell-bent on implementing.

Banning users from accessing a public service you have chosen  to run based on sexuality is fucking disgusting and deeply offensive to the people you are rejecting.

So imagine that there is a nice old couple running a B&amp;B in the chilterns, and they have been doing this for 60 years. They have been brought up to believe that it is wrong to be gay (they were from the same era as when people who are left handed were caned and forced to write with their right hands even though it felt very wrong).

I'm not asking for anyone to change their minds. They can say what they like about people (just as gays can fuck who they like) but they cannot discriminate against those they dislike based on this.

They're actively bigoted; they're the ones who should be uncomfortable. It doesn't work both ways, they're responsible for the problem and not the gays.

If they kindly asked the gay couple not to be too loud when buggering each other and the gay couple were noisy they could probably legitimately ask them to leave based on this; the same would apply to a straight couple being noisy.

These people *will* die out but the attitudes will *not* unless we stop these attitudes being seen as acceptable. By allowing people to do this we are showing that we find it acceptable. If we wish society to change this cannot go on.

So, yes, the bigots will find it uncomfortable. Its the least bad solution.",0,1270392174,null,0,false,0,c0ngr7p,t3_bm7zz,t1_c0ngr7p,t1_c0ngpsq,null,1426263761,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

It's not. It's a private offering. A public service would be a state run B&amp;B.

I can see both sides of the argument. On the one hand discrimination against homosexuals is wrong (unlike discrimination against Tories, something some people would find justifiable) and it is a business and should be subject to the same rules as other businesses.

On the other side of the argument you have the fact that this is someone's home and that people should have the right to determine who they want in their home and who they don't.

The reality of the situation is that regardless of whether or not this is the law forcing people to let people they do not want present into their homes is never going to lead to a positive outcome for any party involved. You can outlaw racism, but you can never outlaw racists and this is (as far as I can see) the crux of the issue. For the tories this isn't about allowing gays or non gays into a business (despite the OP's attempt to portray it that way), it's about people's rights to determine who is allowed in their home.

I've commented on the specific instance before and someone else quite rightly mentioned that attitudes to homosexuality are not going to change overnight. If you're a homosexual paying to stay in a B&amp;B owned by someone who doesn't want you there, they might not be able to directly discriminate but a) they don't deserve your business and b) neither party will have an enjoyable experience dealing with the other. It is this acceptance of reality that has been lacking in not just this but almost all equality laws put forward in the past 13 years.

See here:

  http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/customs/arriving/arrivingnoneu.htm

&gt; You can bring in other goods worth up to £390 without having to pay tax and/or duty.

Googling a price for the Nexus One, says: $590.00 USD which is 388 GBP so it looks like you're just under the limit anyway.

Over £390 and up to £630 there is a customs duty flat rate of 2.5 per cent, plus 17.5% VAT.  Over £630 it depends on the type of goods.

If your friend doesn't have any evidence that points to the fact that he purchased the phone in the US (e.g. no receipts, box, etc) then it's unlikely that customs officers would think twice about it.  However, if they do get suspicious and your friend claims it was purchased in the UK then I believe that they can require you to produce evidence (e.g. receipts) to back that up.  So in the unlikely event that your friend does get stopped, it's probably best just to declare the phone as a new purchase and pay any duty that's owed.

The plan from all the parties seems to be to do the minimum amount of cutting that they think they can get away with and have you and your children (and probably your children's children) pay this off over time while inflating their way out.

Anyone that commits to the kind of cuts actually needed (25% according to the IFS) would be committing political suicide. You'd have to cut frontline services across the civil service, NHS and military as well as renege on countless (but not cuntless) PFI contracts.

52% of the population is employed in some capacity by the government, third after Cuba and China. If you cut across government by the amount needed you're going to increase the jobless count by a couple of million at least due to the people you're getting rid of and companies that are reliant upon government contracts. What needs to happen is whomever wins has to deliver sufficient cuts without killing the patient. If the cuts aren't deep enough the market will fuck us over (it'll make staying in the ERM in 1992 seem like a cakewalk) and we'll be stuck with massive debt repayment increases. Cut too harshly and there'll be so many unemployed (and strikes too) that it'll make Thatcher seem like an amateur industry-fucker.

Like you, I live in a rural area and know that attitudes you've described very well. You've made a very interesting point: generation &amp; upbringing are a feature of our society; attitudes and norms change, and (by definition) clash with the old ones.

For what it's worth, I think Marogian is about right: the old attitudes *will* gradually die out (compare attitudes to race and sexuality in urban Britain now with the 1970's) but that in the meantime, the *law* shouldn't make concessions to bigots.

That's the law. On a personal, more human level, we should be a bit more tolerant of these intolerant people, for the reason you've explained. And in doing so, we should try to make them aware of changing times, and urge them to think about their *own* place in modern society.

It's worth noting that our sympathy for people like this tends to be proportional to their *intent*, more than the language they actually use!

That would seem to imply that the pay gap is primarily attributable to direct discrimination against women by employers, which is not necessarily the case. Multiple studies have found that much of the wage gap can be explained by differing work patterns, life priorities and other factors.

The problem with this is that in many cases it's not really feasible to hold all of that information as it (the taking of such information) potentially opens the company up to legal action when people leave.

Very true and this is the crux of the matter.

&gt; This strikes me as waste of time anyway.

In practice, however, Britain just cannot manage it. The last 10 years has shown massive bureaucracy, investment into a ""nanny state"" etc. Conservatives will reduce this for the time being - until power is decentralized I would rather we were left to our own devices in terms of monetary management.  
  
For example, I believe in a heavily reinforced benefits system, but in practice, Labour has funneled money into a system that is easily abused, and while it give people the chance to ""start at the same level as everyone else"" etc, the system does not encourage people to use this opportunity.  
  
Ultimately, however, I *would* vote labour if all other parties ended this plan: [Moving all services online (timesonline)](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7069240.ece)
  
The reason for this is that ultimately this is what will result in power distribution to citizens. (This opens up the possibility for low cost decision making with referendums). So really it is the most important. (one of the few things in UK politics that I am pretty optimistic about)

Interestingly, the Miliband brothers (in particular Ed Miliband) are the UK politicians which I respect the most - they seem to share the desire to move power back to the people and are championing the idea(source: [Us now](http://vodo.net/usnow))&lt;-- I recommend this to everyone  
  
So I would vote for Labour if:  
- David Miliband was standing for PM  
- Conservatives outright declared that the plan was going to be scrapped  
  
To be completely honest I don't have much trust in my own opinions, as I am not very educated in these regards. I am completely disillusioned with current UK politics though. I see my vote as fairly redundant - party policies are fairly similar in the grand scale of things.

Thoughts? I would be interested to see whether people are in complete disagreement with me.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"So are the owners of [this fine establishment](http://www.guyzhotel.com/) bigoted heterophobic scumbags? What about [this charity](http://www.lesbilicious.co.uk/campaigns-politics/charity-defends-gay-only-job-advertisement/), are they in the wrong?

In the case of the former, it's quite obvious that they don't want straight couples, and that I would imagine most straight couples won't want to be there. And here's the wacky thing - by the standards of most on here they're bigots, but I support their position because I support the owners right to their individual liberty.

&gt; Everyone gets to determine who can come into their home. If you're doing things on a case-by-case basis of letting people in, then sure, your home is your castle.

Absolutely.

&gt; When you say ""everyone is welcome, except &lt;minority&gt;"" you're not really saying who can come in but who can't, and that's problematic. When you run a business that's available to the public, this is what you're saying.

Not quite. When you say everyone is welcome, except &lt;group&gt;, where group could be heterosexuals for example then you're still letting people in on a case by case basis, you're just setting out specific cases that will result in a rejection.

&gt; Basically, the public is a group which you're not allowed to segment according to bigotry. You want the public, you get the public, and all those who sail within her.

Again, why not? If you convert a room in your house into a corner shop and put a sign up saying ""No blacks"" and there was no legislation I would imagine that there'd be an organised boycott (and I'd be one of those helping organise the boycott). You'd also be nuts for cutting out what could be a sizeable chunk of the market. If I set up a shop next door selling the same things to everyone, even at a slightly higher price I'll still put you out of business (especially if I'm still running the boycott).

Of course, there's a larger issue, which is what constitutes discrimination. In this case we're talking about B&amp;Bs and homosexuals. In another instance we're looking at suggested female quotas for boards. In another instance we're looking at minimum pricing on alcohol (which in itself could be argued as discrimination against the poor). At the end of the day the only way you can bring about equality is to level the playing field in people's minds. You can legislate actions but not mindsets, and mindsets are only shaped by raising the issues and promoting them in the public consciousness. This is why we're told we should care about domestic violence with women but not told about it in men, because there isn't a sufficiently powerful male DV special interest group.

Affirmative action is still discrimination. Positive discrimination is still discrimination. People either accept that there are those that will maintain prejudices despite (or in spite of, such as with the BNP) legislation or they hold a belief that the prejudices in people's minds are not important, that they can be controlled by the state and that 2 + 2 can equal five. I'm reminded of a quote from the late great George Orwell's essay on Politics and the English language:

*Political language - and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists - is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"&gt; A vote for the Lib Dems seems like a vote of the Conservatives for me, so I'm going to go with a Labour I'm happy to keep in power.

I disagree here. You're going to see one of the lowest voter turnouts of all time, possibly a couple of independents getting in, maybe the first BNP UKIP seats and a hung parliament whichever way you look. Whatever happens it's highly likely we'll get a coalition/minority government and another election within a year when that fails. No-one's going to be able to implement any real change because all of the bastards would rather fuck each other over than do any good and the country will be more fucked than it is now when whatever coalition falls apart. In this situation a vote for the Lib Dems (unless you're in a constituency with a clear majority or where the Lib Dems are lower than third) does two things. 

Firstly more Lib Dem seats in parliament weakens the eventual government that will be formed. Secondly, more Lib Dem votes will scare the shit out of the other two more than anything else - it'll show that those that do vote no longer want either of the two main parties.

There are some cases where it may make sense to vote differently, such as UKIP if you're in a traditional Tory safe seat with lots of disaffected old school Tories.

Let me repeat: Nobody will win this election outright. All you have the chance to do in this election is vote for an 'other' party (and give the bastards a bloody nose), not vote (and get the government you deserve), or rearrange the yellow, blue and red pie slices - the more yellow the quicker it will fall apart, the more red or blue the longer a coalition will try to hang on.

Most younger DW fans don't get this because they don't seem to fully understand that the head of the BBC was actively trying to kill the series at the time. This means that DW was given a shoestring budget, rookie crew members, terrible writers, and yet despite efforts to make it terrible it wasn't even that bad, just kind of mediocre compared to the 70s and early 80s. But what I really like about Colin's Doctor both on screen and in Big Finish is that he doesn't need to explicitly remind you that the Doctor is an alien, it's always there just under the surface. He would never makeout with a companion, not because he is a prude but because he is simply far more interested in other things. I didn't get into DW for love stories and makeout sessions, I got into DW because I think time travel and aliens and sonic screwdrivers and being able to regenerate into someone with the same memories but a different personality are really really cool concepts and I can't get enough of them. I realize that DW's audience is huge and that to keep some of that audience they need those things that I don't but CB is my favorite because he embodies all the stuff I like about DW without ever coming close to being sappy.

I never understood if River meant she's never seen him *appear* so young or if she was saying that in context of *knowing* not only the Doctors age, but his previous appearances as well. The fact that they were alleged lovers would imply the latter. 

The implications are interesting as one would imply she has/will see him as an older man (older than Tennant and Smith, possibly 1-9) and the other would imply she has seen more than one version *after* Tennant (ruling out her meeting 1-9 and possibly implying a 12th or 13th version). 

***SPOILER***

The actress who plays River *is* appearing this season, but we don't yet know what character she is playing. There is a precedence for actors playing multiple characters on the show, after all. She doesn't seem to be River Song in the previews but more of a sophisticated adventurer along the lines of Lady Christina de Souza.

Also, Rory seemed to take to his role in helping the Doctor all right. Not with enthusiasm, but not too much reluctance either.

There are synopses of the lost episodes (most of them are from the 2nd Doctor's era. There are none that I am aware of after his tenure. (Shada doesn't count plus what the BBC released is pretty watchable) and there are also what's known as ""recons"" where they took the audio of the story and blended it with still shots and what video clips could be found and sort of re-created the episodes. (the toreent I mentioned contains some (all?) of these.) Some are more watchable than others. YMMV. The BBC did one of the Invasion where they animated the missing episodes and I found that to be very well done and I recommend it highly. If you aren't disposed to torrenting then many of the older stories are available on DVD but there are some gaps even amongst stories that do very definitely exist in their totality.

I like him because he brought back the ""alienness""  and mystery that I felt had been missing from Davison's era (Doctor #5) and I liked that he was unstable and rude but that's me. Most people seem to prefer more of a straight heroic instead of an anti-hero type Doctor (like 6 or 9 or even 7 come to think of it, but by his time the production values and writing were so abysmal that it's hard to tell sometimes what they were going for with him).

Tennant was obviously influenced by Davison (as he pretty much tells the you in Time Crash) with the school boyishness and his very straight heroics, and also brought a lot of Tom Bakerish bits too (loves ths sound of his own voice and making speeches, the recklessness he shows towards the end of his run).

[source](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4279317.stm)  
  
No idea what the average income per year is for this industry, so let's assume an ultra low estimate of £10k.  
  
10k / 3.6 = approx 2800  
  
so cost of employing someone to kill ONE fox is at least £2800. This figure doesn't even consider other costs (dogs, horses, jobs related to fox hunting, overheads, and the opportunity cost of these people actually doing something productive)  
  
**Ineffective as a solution:**  
  
Targeted fox hunts kill an estimated 21,500 to 25,000 foxes (roughly 4% of the UK's fox population) annually, while more than 100,000 may be killed on the UK's roads each year.

I don't hunt, I would like to but I'm not into the horse thing. Lots of people I know and most of my family do.
Firstly we're not posh, toffs or any other wank like that, I think the misconception comes from the fact that a lot of countryside people have old fashion accents, we just don't say innit enough to appear working (or whatever) class to city dwellers.
Its not barbaric. It's more natural than you think. You have one animal, its a predator and competes with humans for their food.

You have another animal, also a predator but a pack hunter with a keen nose. The latter hunts the former, just like when you watch your nature programs although this time we have another animal, also a predator, riding a herbivour co-ordinating the pack. Get a grip. An animal having its throat slit an dangled upside down, awake and aware for up to three minutes bleeding to death is fine (kosha and halal, I've seen it) is fine, or dannish battery farmed pigs (you thought out supermarkets were full of cheep danaish pork was becuase it was tastier?) are accepted by the British public as being fine, one animal being hunted by another animal (or two) is cruel, bloodthirsty etc.

Other control methods just aren't as effective an are less humane. Someone here mentions a non-lethal trap. Great but not an economic or viable solution for many rural farmers. Not to mention that not all farmers have a warped view on an animals life, they breed and rear animals for slaughter, killing a pest, good God man where is your compassion! Lethal traps are pretty cruel, mostly being snares which trap the animal (in much distress) for a prolonged period of time before being shot or it strangles them, I think an animal that lives wild is far more accustomed to chased by another predator than throttled by wire.
Shooting foxes isn't as simple as it seems, getting close enough for a shotgun is difficult and the time it takes to wait for a fox to appear to have a pop just isn't available to farmers, its actually a bloody hard job, even without people who just don't have a clue telling them how they can/should do it. How many of you have hunted an animal with a firearm? If you think it's a case of strolling around merrily blasting at thinkgs that move you're sincerely wrong. It takes skill, patience and persistance, often lying somewhere for a prolonged period of time in shitty weather waiting for a five second window, or you could go lamping, gee thats fair (assuming you one of those here that thinks killing in any form is all about fair play), stun 'em with a lamp!

&gt;ripped apart by dogs

Um unlike you a dog still has its killer instinct, it goes for the throat, it kills its prey as quickly and cleany as possible. I imagine if I gave you a chicken you'd do the same...ok maybe you wouldn't, you'd pull it limb from limb, good call.

&gt;I don't see people chasing deers or badgers

We do chase dear with dogs in the right season and breed of dog, and there is a ban on killing badgers at the moment so we don't kill those. Besides they mostly come out at night and don't venture too far from their holes so chasing them with dogs and horses is unnecessary and an inefficient method of killing them.
It's a bigger industry than you think. Job prospects are different here. You travel into a city/town, own a white van and drive it in a manic manner or do something rural, farm work, kennels, farrier, agricultural vet, work at a local stables, work for the hunt etc. It really is a different way of life for people in rural areas. Oh by the way all of those career paths are supported by fox hunting, and we need jobs too, they're necessary so there's another thing as well as population control.

&gt;waste of resources

Who's wasting it? Do your taxes pay for fox hunting? No they pay for the police force who have to spend a vast amount of resources policing something they can't actually police, I think that's a waste don't you?

At the end of the day I believe all of this doesn't have anything to do with why it was banned, it was banned because a lot of people are too detached from where their meat comes form, or the fact they are an animal, a predator infact and therefore cannot understand why anyone could enjoy hunting. I enjoy hunting with a rifle, and many I know enjoy hunting on horse back, or with a fishing rod. We are highly evolved hunters, and some of us like to remember that. I also think the whole affair is a major class thing for the labour Goverment and many of the well off people in cities who can't accept they're middle class no matter how many times they say innit and therefore have a pop and what they believe to be a higher class, we're poor here to you know, and many of us worse off than people in cities with better job prospects but I guess rural folk are believed to be upper class or at least thats the reception I get.
The comment that enraged me the most here I will reply to in person so at least I know they will read it.

tldr:

It does serve a purpose, It's actually the most human and natural way to kill a fox, it's got a lot to do with a skewered vision of class, if you can't understand why someone would want to hunt another animal ask yourself what particular type of animal you are (answer: hunter gatherer) and we still do hunt, and will continue to do so.",0,1270760369,null,0,true,0,c0nqy4y,t3_bo6r0,t1_c0nqy4y,t3_bo6r0,null,1426268949,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Ripped to shreds? Have you seen a dog killing an animal? Not even on the media outlets you so closely follow the situation in Gaza?

Do you really know whats going on there, do you protest about? Have you been there? Do you really do anything or actually give a shit, or do you just enjoy shouting about the fact you care as much as you like being a class warrior? What class do you actually think hunt?

I've seen every regeneration sequence right back to the beginning with Hartnell-Troughton where he just sort of gets tired and gives up. I have never guessed it beforehand or even tried to, but since you seem to be a New Who fan and possibly unfamiliar with the classic series, let's run them down:

1st: gets old and tired, basically lays down and regenerates.
2nd: forced to regenerate by the Time Lords to begin his exile on earth
3rd: ravaged by the energies of Metabelis crystals (some kind of weird psychic energy or radiation? I'd have to watch it again to remind myself which I think it was)
4th: falls about 5-6 stories from a large radio telescope dish(lamest reason to regenerate ever, imo, and sad because 4 was so awesome)
5th: poisoned by spectrox toxemia which is apparently some kind of weird alien bat gunk on some kind of ""nest""
6th: Who knows? The Rani finds him in the TARDIS, turns him over and he regenerates, conveniently never mentions whatever happened to him to instigate this.
7th: shot in the head by thugs in the tv movie (2nd lamest because it is mundane and was in the abysmal tv movie (yes, I know some people liked it but I hated it and I can say what I want))
8th: Another question. Something to do with the TimeWar, I assume.
9th: absorbs the energies of the Time Vortex that were inside Rose when she became the Bad Wolf. The big question here is why the fuck is Rose still alive since she absorbed the same energies for what seemed like a longer time?!
10th: Weird radiation from a glass box.

That fails to take into account that there are other members of the audience present who were enjoying the act before someone decided to kill the mood. 

Boyle's whole act is in being outrageously offensive to everyone and not respecting the boundaries of good taste. The audience know this before going in and set aside their moral compass for the duration of the show. The pleasure is, to some extent, in the guilt. When you break the illusion FB creates during his act (the illusion of a tasteless world), you ruin it for everyone.

And nothing in the phrase ""hypocritical cow"" suggests otherwise.  I really wish people would please stop painting legitimate criticism as some kind of infringement of freedom of speech.  You have the right to *speak*, not the right to be agreed-with, and *certainly* not the right to be immune to criticism if what you say is stupid.

&gt; Yes, she's upset by the fact that FB make jokes about people with downs, but she's also upset by his response when he came over and talked to her.

Really?  Why?  How do comedians normally deal with hecklers or people who talk through their set?  If you go to see the 'I would happily punch every one of you in the face' tour by a comedian you specifically laud for being ""dry"" and ""nasty"", it's expected that you can (metaphorically) deal with being punched in the face.

If you can't, and get offended, and feel the need to talk through the set, *you* have committed the faux-pas, not the performer on-stage whose performance you're interrupting.

&gt; Has anyone here ever cared for or brought up a disabled child? its incredibly tiring and difficult, and to have someone mock that

You're reacting emotionally, and irrationally.  Nobody's saying she shouldn't have felt upset - they're saying:

1. She's a hypocrite, because she's perfectly happy to laugh at anyone else's disability or minority group (seriously: it's practically all Frankie Boyle *has* in the way of ""comedy"")
2. She's stupid, because you shouldn't *actively go and seek out* nasty comedy *because it's too nasty to be shown on TV* if you can't deal with it when you find it.

&gt; of course its going to make you upset - not quite in the same league as mocking gay people or fat people.

Oh *right* - ""fat people and gay people and black people and abused kids are funny, but *my personal* issue or minority are off-limits"".

Jesus - you're as bad as the author.

&gt; The blogger was upset as his ""fuck you I don't care anyway"" recation when it was clear she'd been (naturally) upset by the jokes.

Right... and when you got to a bar, and drink more than you can handle, the barman is *morally obliged* to act like it's his fault instead of yours for *you* not being able to handle your drink.

Or when you go to a concert and the music's too loud for your delicate ears, the band are obliged to turn it down, instead of you standing at the back, buying earplugs or simply not going to see live music.

And when you go to see an offensive comedian *because he's offensive*, and you're the only one in the room who gets upset at a joke, *he's* morally obliged to stop his performance, break character, bring the entire atmosphere down and sincerely apologise to you for the fact you got exactly what you asked for - offensive comedy.

I think Frankie Boyle's an offensive, juvenile, small-minded little prick, but I think the kind of self-entitled people who would go to a public performance, object to the performance on the basis it's exactly what they intended to see, and *then* expect the entire performance to come screeching to a halt (until the performer sincerely apologises for doing what they paid him to do and validated their self-important whingeing) are worse.

Nobody said she didn't have a *right* to do it - you're persisting in trying to frame this as a ""rights"" debate, when it's nothing of the sort and nobody ever suggested it was.

If you use your freedom of speech to assert the sky is green, I can criticise you for saying something stupid without infringing on your right to free speech.  Criticism is not censorship, and it's *deeply* intellectually dishonest to paint it as such.  You have the right to Free Speech - you do *not* have any right to Always Be Agreed-With.

Likewise, she exercised her right to get upset and speak out, but we're criticising her for being a self-serving hypocrite - laughing at other minority jokes then throwing a hissy fit when someone jokes about an issue *she* identifies with.  She's happy to take part in the offence of others, but then flips out when she gets offended in turn.  That's practically the *dictionary definition* of the term ""hypocrite"".

You're condemning Boyle for being dismissive and uncaring but *that's his job* as an offensive comedian.  If you don't like it don't go to watch offensive comedians, end of story.  Certainly don't expect him to spoil the entertainment of several hundred other people because *you* couldn't handle the offensiveness of the comedy *you* chose to see.

You have the *right* to exercise your freedom of speech to complain if you get wet, but when you *just chose to jump in a lake*, if you do so you're a complete idiot.

Apologies for being rude, but you seemed to ignore her hypocrisy and stupidity in favour of irrelevantly supporting her for exercising a right nobody had ever questioned.

And again, apologies for accusing you of reacting emotionally, but your argument made no sense (it was irrelevant to the discussion at hand), and seemed to revolve around the fact that people looking after disabled kids have a hard time.

1) ""If you use your freedom of speech to assert the sky is green, I can criticise you for saying something stupid without infringing on your right to free speech. Criticism is not censorship, and it's deeply intellectually dishonest to paint it as such. You have the right to Free Speech - you do not have any right to Always Be Agreed-With.""

But Kingmaker is making no such supposition. You, in fact, have now twice tried to shove those words into Kingmaker's mouth despite the lack of them in Kingmaker's actual postings. The only thing she said was, and I quote, ""She has a right to blog about something that upset her"". You have agreed that she has a right to free speech, and nobody is debating this. You agree with Kingmaker. However you then attempt to suggest that Kingmaker has also said that she has a right to be agreed with. This is fallacious, and you need to go back and re-read her posts and, might I suggest, apologise for blatantly trying to make a straw man.

2) ""Likewise, she exercised her right to get upset and speak out, but we're criticising her for being a self-serving hypocrite - laughing at other minority jokes then throwing a hissy fit when someone jokes about an issue she identifies with. She's happy to take part in the offence of others, but then flips out when she gets offended in turn. That's practically the dictionary definition of the term ""hypocrite"".""

That may be, but Kingmaker isn't fighting that battle - you are. All she did was to point out that the woman had a right to write her blog, and that she was brave to have stood up for herself in the face of Frankie Boyle. You are trying to make this debate about her standing up for hypocrisy when in fact she is simply making a point and congratulating the woman for saying that she was upset. Which you've already agreed that she had a right to be, because she has freedom of speech, regardless of how hypocritical you may or may not feel that to be.

3) ""You're condemning Boyle for being dismissive and uncaring but that's his job as an offensive comedian. If you don't like it don't go to watch offensive comedians, end of story. Certainly don't expect him to spoil the entertainment of several hundred other people because you couldn't handle the offensiveness of the comedy you chose to see.""

Kingmaker is not condemning him for being dismissive and uncaring. Read her posts again. She says that the woman in the audience was upset by his 'fuck it, I don't care' attitude. This does not equal condemnation, but recognition of someone else's upset at this response. I like FB too, but I also think he does sometimes go just a bit too far, and I agree with Kingmaker that perhaps sometimes he needs to be reminded of this - but that's just us exercising our freedom of speech - which you've already stated you agree with. I'm not asking you to agree, because I don't have a right to be agreed with. Just thought I'd make that point now in case you try to cram those words into my mouth the way you tried to with Kingmaker.

4) ""And again, apologies for accusing you of reacting emotionally, but your argument made no sense (it was irrelevant to the discussion at hand), and seemed to revolve around the fact that people looking after disabled kids have a hard time.""

Good, an apology. But to suggest that the argument made no sense is just foolish and erroneous. She was attempting to point out that there is a human being with a real life behind this story and spate of accusations of hypocrisy who has perhaps had a hard time of it. I hardly think that's irrelevant given that the first post in this thread was accusing the woman of being a hypocritical cow. Like I said, I like FB, but I'd feel uncomfortable if he started cracking jokes about Downs' kids. I am well aware that he pushes boundaries, and if I were to go to his show and get offended by that, and then wrote a blog about it, I would actually be being hypocritical - because I have no Downs child. The woman in question was simply upset by it, and chose to blog about it. She's not launching a campaign to shut Frankie Boyle up; she's not crusading on the front page of the tabloids with headlines like FRANKIE BOYLE DISSED MY DOWNS CHILD; she didn't shout at him all the way through the show (as some people appear to be suggesting) - she was rather eloquently and very calmly stating her feelings about it. I read the post (some other people on here might be rewarded and possibly feel a little shamefaced if they too read it) and can't see why people here are getting so annoyed with her and calling her a hypocrite. 

So, tips for making friends and not pissing people off:
* Actually argue with people on arguments that they make, not arguments that you spuriously try to cram into their mouths.

* Read the posts properly. And read the source material that the posts are commenting on.

* Don't fume and vent and gnash your teeth in such venom when, at the same time, telling someone who has made a pretty placid post that they are reacting irrationally and emotionally. That just makes you look like a hypocritical fuckwit (your term).

Understandably it's not always going to be the case but it's much less common for ripped to shreds senario however as regards as to footage that ends up being spread it's usually the most brutal available, you couldn't whip up a frenzy with the truth now could you.

If you're using class to create an affect you shouldn't, it undermines your arguement and makes you seem childish, working classes aren't always scum, and toffs aren't always cunts (unfortunately mostly they are though).

I'm not assuming if something happens with regularity then it is acceptable, infact I'm not making many assumptions at all, I live surrounded and interact with those that hunt and hunts themselves, I am actually quite well informed about this. I'm trying to point out that as an animal, a predatorial animal, there is a reward system intergrated in your brain with regards to hunting. It is an enjoyable pursiut. Now I'm not saying this is a good reason to just kill anything but as regards to foxes they are in some respects a pest and therfore need to be managed. If you think about it what is the point of any sport? It's a bit of physical excersise and mental reward for success, in most sports that is achieved by winning, defeating you opposition in a particular skill to claim victory, and cue rush of tasty brain chemicals making everything seem all lovely. Calling sports of any kind pointless is silly because in reality they all are, apart from the rewards they give to a participation in terms of manipulation of how we, the animal homosapien, is wired to work. That and the economies that grow up and around sports to support them but that is not the reason we participate, rather the effect of our enjoyment of sports.

 I am aware that numbers of livestock killed are actually quite low, and why do you think this is? Perhaps there is an effective method of population control going on. I hate to break it you but hunting still takes place, foxes are still killed by that method. Maybe not always intentionally but the ban really didn't change much, it is the most effective method of hunting this particular pest. Yes it's a bit much but shooting a fox is much easier said than done and traps are much worse in reality for the fox. They're either caught in the snare for days of choked to death.

As far as people being hurt by foxhunting quite a few have actually, or more to the point by it being banned. It might interest you to know that one of the conditions for the labour backbenchers to allow Tony to take us to Iraq was a ban on fox hunting (a class thing). It's a rather weak point to make as I doubt the ban failing would have stopped the war (which is why I left it out earlier) but it is interesting to get a view on how politics works.

&gt;If it were not for foxes the countryside would be overrun with rodents

Ok I'm not going to get as worked up about this kind of stuff as I did last night but are you serious? I have lived my whole life in rurul areas. Farms are overun by rats and mice, it's a known fact that where you have food you have rodents. We have our ways of dealing with that but it's just a fact of life. You should be more concerned about how overun by rodents the cities and towns are, where nobody hunts the foxes.

Foxes mostly hunt rabbits and if they're lucky they'll nab a hare or wild fowl. If it weren't for mixie we really would be overun by rabbits but it was well before my time they decided to introduce that so please don't go on about whether that was right or wrong.

Ignoring something that does not directly harm you is not ignorant, ignorance is not knowing. Ignoring something that does not directly harm you happens to be a nasty aspect of human nature, how could you possibly go on if you were consciencely acitve about all the things that happen out there that are appalling and barbaric (gee that word has been used a lot here in this thread, looks like this is it's first appropriate appearance though). As much as this is going to upset you there is simply a limited amount you can do, and a limited amount your brain will let you do. Now I'm not saying everyone is incapable of compassion or caring for those they can't see nor touch nor hear but no one is capable of compassion for everything that deserves it.
I think one thing I have really taken to heart, ok maybe two, out of this affair is that there are very few rural redditors in the UK subreddit, and most of those who are here are ignorant (correct usage of the word there) about how rural life is conducted.

Foxhunting is far from pointless. As far as sports go it is one of the few that has a point, population control seems a little more worthy than to see a ball go in a net don't you think? The point behind why we play sports is more vague and misunderstood than you think. As concerning rural economies too foxhunting is very important. It isn't all offices round here, jobs are different both in manner and requirements. Foxhunting supports a vast network of rural livelihoods which if you find hard to believe by all means let me know in your reply (I'm assuming you're hard headed enough to rarley admit you're wrong, don't get too upset, and therfore will be replying to me)

Legally, while your name is on the lease, the place is yours. If he wants to come and have a look round he has to ask for permission. What evidence is he basing the assumption that you live there on?

It's bullshit because he holds the bond, so if he refuses to release it on the made up grounds that she has someone living there, you'd have to take him to the small claims court and he would have to prove that she had broken the terms of the contract, of course he can't do it so he'd probably give the bond back if you looked like you were going to make good on the threat.

Bottom line, I've had several arguments with landlords/letting agents regarding getting my bond back - them claiming that the normal wear and tear was somehow my fault (like I could float over the carpets and not walk on them), blaming totally made up stuff on me (one claimed that I'd trashed the cooker and wanted me to replace it) - I've always got it back, but purely through bloody minded persistence.

&gt; But Kingmaker is making no such supposition.

Yes they are:

&gt; I'm just standing up for her right to do what she did.

Nobody questioned that right.  There's no need to stand up for rights which aren't being infringed, so by doing so it clearly implies that KM perceives the author's rights to have been infringed by the criticism.

Also:

&gt;&gt;&gt; She has a right to blog about something that's upset her!

Which is completely irrelevant unless someone suggested otherwise.  All we did was criticise her, so this also clearly implies KM considers criticism to be infringement of the right to Free Speech (ie, tantamount to censorship).

&gt; You are trying to make this debate about her standing up for hypocrisy when in fact she is simply making a point and congratulating the woman for saying that she was upset.

Actually [the thread we're in](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/boa00/punching_me_in_the_face_would_have_been/c0nqp22) is a thread criticising her for her hypocrisy.  The topic of this thread is therefore clearly established as ""is the author a hypocrite""?

KM then posted standing up for the author's right to comment.

There are two possibilities here:

* At *best* KM's posting something completely irrelevant, because nobody questioned the woman's right to speak, and her bravery (or presumption) is irrelevant to the question of whether she's a hypocrite or not.  This makes KM's comment a completely irrelevant non-sequitur, which adds nothing to the discussion.

* Alternatively, KM could be implying that the woman's rights had been infringed, and/or that the woman was correct and justified in her actions (and if you read [their original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/boa00/punching_me_in_the_face_would_have_been/c0ns6u4) that's certainly what it looks like they're doing).  These are the words you're accusing me of ""putting in their mouth"".

So which is it?  Was KM's comment utterly meaningless and irrelevant, or *were* they arguing in favour of hypocrisy?  I know which one my money's on.

&gt; Kingmaker is not condemning him for being dismissive and uncaring. Read her posts again. She says that the woman in the audience was upset by his 'fuck it, I don't care' attitude. This does not equal condemnation, but recognition of someone else's upset at this response.

I think you're taking KM's words out of context here.  They were *responding to a comment which strongly criticised the author*, and chose to do so by complimenting her and justifying the her position.

You might not take that as arguing her side in the debate, but it's a pretty weird thing to post *in a debate, in response to a stinging criticism* if you aren't. &lt;:-)

&gt; I like FB too

Actually I really don't like the guy - I suspect he's a juvenile fuckwit who's little better than Bernard Manning (the best you can say about Frankie Boyle is that at least he probably doesn't *believe* the jokes he makes are true).

However, while I can easily dismiss lowbrow idiots like FB, I have a pet peeve with hypocrisy, and *really hate* people with the kind of inflated sense of entitlement I believe the author displayed.

&gt; She was attempting to point out that there is a human being with a real life behind this story and spate of accusations of hypocrisy who has perhaps had a hard time of it. I hardly think that's irrelevant given that the first post in this thread was accusing the woman of being a hypocritical cow.

But this is exactly what I mean - it's completely irrelevant to the issue.  We didn't accuse her of ""having an easy life"", or ""having no reason at all for getting upset"".  We accused her of a precise, technical moral failing - hypocrisy.

Do I have sympathy for the author because she has a disabled child?  Yes, unreservedly.

Does having a disabled child *exempt* her from all criticism?  Does it *permit* her to be a hypocrite?  Does it *negate* the stupidity of going to see an offensive comedian and then getting offended at his jokes?  No, of course not.

I can believe she's had a tough time of it, but that doesn't mean she isn't *also* a ""hypocritical cow"".

When someone has a disadvantage in life that entitles them to sympathy and consideration.  Their victim status does *not* give them a blank slate to do whatever they want without criticism, or somehow permanently position them on some unimpeachable moral high-horse.

I should be judged a hypocrite based on what I say and do.  Whether I was abused as a child, or have no legs, or am a disabled, gay, African-American midget is completely irrelevant to the issue of ""whether I claim one thing and do another"".

This is what I meant by ""reacting emotionally"", rather than rationally.  You're letting your sympathy for her on one issue (having a Downs kid) cloud your judgement of her on a completely separate issue (whether she's a hypocrite or not).

Just because Hitler committed the holocaust that doesn't mean that ""remembering Eva Braun's birthday"" wasn't a nice thing he did.  And just because Mother Theresa or Gandhi helped a lot of poor, disadvantaged people that wouldn't excuse them - for example - stomping a kitten to death.

Two entirely separate issues, two entirely separate judgements, and yet your feelings regarding one appear to be affecting your judgement regarding the the other - no?

&gt; I am well aware that he pushes boundaries, and if I were to go to his show and get offended by that, and then wrote a blog about it, I would actually be being hypocritical - because I have no Downs child.

You seem to be confused here. - [hypocrisy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocrisy) is basically ""claiming one thing and doing another"", or ""violating your claimed principles when it's to your advantage""... like generally approving of humour at the expense of minority groups *right up until* it's your minority group that's the butt of a joke, and then getting all pissy and offended by it.  Or like fighting against intolerance and prejudice against Downs kids, but still approving of and laughing at jokes about *other* minority or disadvantaged groups.

Whether you have a Downs child or not is completely and utterly irrelevant to this question.

&gt; I read the post (some other people on here might be rewarded and possibly feel a little shamefaced if they too read it) and can't see why people here are getting so annoyed with her and calling her a hypocrite.

I'll try to break it down for you:

1. Author clearly approves of FB - she ""loved"" his ""nasty"" humour, and approves of him as ""dry"" and ""clever"", even finding him ""attractive"".  Since Frankie Boyle's entire schtick is nasty jokes about tasteless subjects (and features a *lot* of jokes in questionable taste, *often* aimed at minority groups), she clearly approves of jokes about minorities and disadvantaged groups.

2. The author hears FB telling jokes about one particular minority group, and gets upset because it's a group she identifies with.

3. She then writes a long blog post implying he's bad for making jokes about *her* minority group, even though she already apparently cheerfully approves of jokes about *anyone else's* minority group.

Her having a downs kid does not in anyway entitle her to laugh at everybody elses misfortune but throw a shit fit when someone laughs at her misfortune.

It is NO different than 

A fat guy (and im a fat guy) laughing at jokes about everybody then complaining when a fat joke gets made.
A gay person laughing at others then complaining when a gay joke gets made.
A woman laughing at others then complaining when a sexist joke gets made.

and so on and so on.....

She is a hypocrite and you are either willingly ignorrant of the defintion of hypocrisy or you are deliberately trying to start an arguement about something i never even mentioned. Ie wether she has a right to bitch or not.

You are also exercising that right by criticising her, but some voices in this thread are figuratively, and in some cases literally, telling the woman she has no right to complain if she goes to this show and gets offended - and I quote;

""Dont go and sit in the front row then act like a stuck up bitch when he innocently does his routine or plays off the crowds reactions. If you dont like the joke dont laugh... but dont start moaning and then acting like hes shat in your dinner when he asks you whats wrong.""

In other words, she has NO right to complain or voice her upset - at least not without attracting damning condemnation. You yourself call her an idiot for going to see FB, comparing it to jumping in a lake and crying because you get wet. This assumes that FB has a track record of making jokes about Downs' children, yet I have to this day never seen him make a crack about them. Therefore, yours is a highly inaccurate analogy. A better one would be this: 

Let's say that you were brutally abused as a small child, and you go to see a comedian who, to your knowledge, despite being edgy and offensive, has never to your knowledge ridiculed child abuse. Suddenly, in the middle of a routine, he starts making crack after crack about kidfuckers, and some of the gags hit horribly close to home - let's say it was an uncle who abused you, and he starts making cracks about uncles fucking their nephews. You feel gutted and unbelievably hurt - the guy has, unwittingly, just ripped open the scars. When he sees you looking distraught, he comes over and asks what's wrong. You tell him. He looks flustered, but comes back with ""Well, I couldn't give a fuck. What did you even come to my show for if you're so easily offended?"" 

A little bit of empathy goes a long way, and rather than callously shitting on the blogger for some perceived hypocrisy, try to show a little bit of humanity and empathy instead. In other words, act like a human being and not a colossal cock.

By jumping in to defend the blogger against this attack, Kingmaker is also taking advantage of her right to free speech by taking a viewpoint you don't agree with. The mountain of cries of ""Hypocrite"" and repeatedly telling the blogger to basically shut the fuck up as she chose to go to see FB, can be quite easily seen as an attempt to deny the blogger's right to free speech. Thus Kingmaker's defence of her is a reminder to these people that the woman has a right to say this, and not be told to shut up. It was a passive defence; Kingmaker did not accuse anyone per se of denying her this right, but she was reminding people that they are perhaps going too far and are in danger of encroaching on that right.

2) ""But this is exactly what I mean - it's completely irrelevant to the issue. We didn't accuse her of ""having an easy life"", or ""having no reason at all for getting upset"". We accused her of a precise, technical moral failing - hypocrisy.

Do I have sympathy for the author because she has a disabled child? Yes, unreservedly.

Does having a disabled child exempt her from all criticism? Does it permit her to be a hypocrite? Does it negate the stupidity of going to see an offensive comedian and then getting offended at his jokes? No, of course not.""

The case remains one of opinion as to whether she is indeed guilty of any hypocrisy at all. I believe, for the reasons I outlined above, and in my other post, that she is not a hypocrite, but was just hit where it hurts, and spoke about it. This is not hypocrisy. Hypocrisy would be turning up at a BNP meeting and being offended at the racism being bandied about. Hypocrisy would be taking on a bear and then whining endlessly about how you no longer have a face. But going to see a comedian who, as far as she was concerned had never stooped to making cracks about disabled kids, and being shocked by something she wasn't expecting, that isn't hypocrisy. To modify your own analogy, it's like jumping into a swimming pool and suddenly having your legs sheared off by a hidden razor wire. I hardly think she can be guilty of hypocrisy on this count. Thus your statement; 

""This is what I meant by ""reacting emotionally"", rather than rationally. You're letting your sympathy for her on one issue (having a Downs kid) cloud your judgement of her on a completely separate issue (whether she's a hypocrite or not).""

is irrelevant as this was not an emotional response on my part, but an intellectual one. I empathised with her, but at the same time I am perfectly capable of perceiving this rationally - which some of the other people on this thread seem unable to do.

3) ""You seem to be confused here. - hypocrisy is basically ""claiming one thing and doing another"", or ""violating your claimed principles when it's to your advantage""... like generally approving of humour at the expense of minority groups right up until it's your minority group that's the butt of a joke, and then getting all pissy and offended by it. Or like fighting against intolerance and prejudice against Downs kids, but still approving of and laughing at jokes about other minority or disadvantaged groups.""

I like a lot of FB's stuff, however I reserve the right to be unamused or even offended by anyone's jokes, regardless of how I might like some of their stuff. I can't laugh much at his gags about child abuse, because, unlike much cleverer comedians who make gags about it, such as Doug Stanhope, FB just goes for cheap laughs with no satire intended. I can laugh endlessly at Doug Stanhope's rant against Jews because he very cleverly makes it not about Jews, but about religion as a whole. FB just makes gags about special uncles. In this lady's case, she also had the right to be offended by any of FB's jokes too - and she may well have been - but she didn't rant about anything else other than one set of gags that hit close to home and affected her personally. You're assuming that she approves of jokes about minorities, but FB doesn't actually joke that much about minorities in his shows. He does a lot of Scottish-bashing gags, one-off gags about famous people, but in terms of actually picking on minorities, he does comparatively little of that. What's wrong with someone liking rough-edged and edgy humour, but being offended a bit when they cross the line? In fact, it's hypocritical of FB to go out and do a show that is so self-consciously edgy and then get all pissy when someone gets offended, surely? You are basing your whole assessment of her hypocrisy based on your incomplete understanding of what is in a Frankie Boyle show, and what she likes about it.

No. 

She was feeling uncomfortable but didn't say anything. Her husband asked her if she was OK. Frankie Boyle noticed her discomfort and *deliberately picked on her*. She was not willing to say anything at first and said she felt as though she wished the ground would swallow her up. FB persisted, and deliberately made a big deal of her discomfort.

In essence: Its not that she went to see a show and got offended even though she knew the content, she went to see a show and was made to feel uniquely uncomfortable by the comedian himself. 

All those who are saying that *the woman* made the rest of the audience should think again. I think the person who made the audience uncomfortable that night was Frankie Boyle.

&gt; Not really. If you remove yourself from the debate a step, an entire thread condemning what I see as a perfectly reasonable reaction as hypocrisy can also be seen as an attempt to silence someone

No.  It's an *invitation* for them to silence *themselves*, by allowing them to realise that their opinions aren't shared by most other people.  Censorship is *forced* silencing by *a third party*.  Ridicule is a *request* they silence *themselves*, which the speaker is free to ignore if they wish.

You're characterising an optional request as force, and that's just wrong.

&gt; or at least ridicule them, for doing nothing more than exercising their right to freedom of speech.

Ridicule is not censorship.  Ridicule *is* free speech. You can't be certain you even *have* free speech unless you're using it to say something someone somewhere would rather you didn't.

The effect of ridicule might be to *discourage* some speech, but that is not force or censorship, and is an unavoidable consequence of simultaneously having free speech *and* caring what people think of you.

People can still choose to say or believe things in the face of ridicule, so nobody's rights are being infringed.  It's terribly tempting and self-serving for people who assert or support ridiculous things to equate ridicule with censorship, but it's horseshit.

&gt; some voices in this thread are figuratively, and in some cases literally, telling the woman she has no right to complain if she goes to this show and gets offended

Requests again.  Harshly expressed, but still only requests, which the author is free to follow or refuse, entirely at her whim.

&gt; In other words, she has NO right to complain or voice her upset

There are different types of rights, you know - legal rights, moral rights, inalienable human rights and several other types.

I sincerely doubt anyone on this thread would *seriously* advocate removing her right to free speech for her stupid statements, but it's perfectly possible to claim she has no *moral* right to complain if she's the cause of her own problem.

I jump in a pool.  I climb out and bitch endlessly about how I'm wet now.  Are you honestly telling me that you don't see the difference between usages in:

""You jumped in the pool by choice, so you *abdicate your legal right* to freedom of speech"", and

""You jumped in the pool, so (while you have a *legal* right to say whatever you want), *morally* you would be wrong to complain about it to me and expect sympathy as if you were the victim.

&gt; at least not without attracting damning condemnation.

Ah!  Look!  It's an example of the common, lesser-spotted ""Right To Be Agreed-With""!  A reclusive creature, they tend to spend their time camouflaged behind euphemisms and vague definitions, or nesting in blithe, unsupported assumptions.  It's very rare to see a naked, unashamed one in the wild like this.

&gt; When he sees you looking distraught, he comes over and asks what's wrong. You tell him. He looks flustered, but comes back with ""Well, I couldn't give a fuck. What did you even come to my show for if you're so easily offended?""

First, he's an offensive comedian.  If I quite intentionally go to see a show, knowing it'll be offensive, and he tells a joke and I can't handle it, that's *my* problem not his.

I might be upset, but I would try to hide it as best as possible (because it's not his problem - it's mine), leaving if I couldn't stand it.

Even if he noticed, and asked what was up I'd try to play it down and would fight shy of announcing I was offended to the whole theatre (because it's my problem, not theirs, and I wouldn't want to spoil the mood), and even had I done *that*, when I posted on my blog later I certainly wouldn't try to take the moral high-ground and claim I was ""disappointed in"" the guy, or accuse him of ""stooping to such low levels, such poor humour"" like he's morally wrong to have done so... *especially* when I was laughing like a drain at all the *other* offensive humour right up to that point.

Had the author said ""Frankie Boyle made an offensive joke about Downs kids and I was upset"", nobody would have called her anything.  However, the fact she paid him to do it, approved of all his other offensive anti-minority jokes and then *tried to assume the moral high-ground* and criticised him for making another one that happened to offend her (rather than anyone else) makes her a hypocrite.

&gt; A little bit of empathy goes a long way, and rather than callously shitting on the blogger for some perceived hypocrisy, try to show a little bit of humanity and empathy instead. In other words, act like a human being and not a colossal cock.

As I said, I have sympathy for her being the parent of a kid with Downs.  However, that *in no way* means she isn't also a hypocritical, self-important idiot.  Which part of this aren't you getting?  Moreover, why *can't* you discuss whether she's self-entitled or a hypocrite without constantly referring to her kid?  The two issues are completely separate, and your inability to separate them is an indication of muddled and overly-emotive thinking.

If this were a discussion about ""how she's the Mum of a disabled kid and what a hard job that is"" I'd be singing her praises.  Unfortunately you're in a thread about how she's *also* a self-important hypocrite, and is apparently unable to comprehend that merely because her feelings were hurt that she isn't necessarily morally in the right.

Hence, I'm making the case she's a hypocrite.  That doesn't mean I think hypocrisy defines her entire character, or that she has no positive traits at all.  *It means I can stay on topic*, whereas you keep getting distracted by irrelevant (but sympathy-inducing) details.

&gt; Thus Kingmaker's defence of her is a reminder to these people that the woman has a right to say this, and not be told to shut up.

I'm just going to keep saying this until it sinks in.  Criticism Is Not Censorship, and you have no Right To Be Agreed-With.

Nobody was infringing the author's *legal* right to speak, and as she entirely engineered her own downfall she arguably has no *moral* right to complain, condemn the comedian or play the victim.

Which is what people are pointing out.

&gt; This is not hypocrisy. Hypocrisy would be turning up at a BNP meeting and being offended at the racism being bandied about.

No, that would be *stupid*.  Hypocrisy would be railing against racism then being prejudiced against someone else for their colour.

&gt; Hypocrisy would be taking on a bear and then whining endlessly about how you no longer have a face.

No, that would be *unjustified*.  Hypocrisy would be castigating others for harming bears then casually running one over because you couldn't be bothered not to.

I think it's pretty clear from this little paragraph that you *simply don't understand what the word ""hypocrisy"" means*, so - as I've already explained it several times, and provided links where appropriate - I really question the value of continuing this discussion at all.

&gt; I like a lot of FB's stuff, however I reserve the right to be unamused or even offended by anyone's jokes, regardless of how I might like some of their stuff.

Right - you can *feel* offended by anything you like, but that doesn't necessarily mean you're reasonably/morally entitled to, or that you're right to do so.

You can feel offended any time you choose to, but there's a difference between *feeling* offended and believing you're entitled to assume the moral high ground and condemn someone else for it.

If I go to an *offensive* comedian, *because he's offensive*, and I *pay him to be offensive*, then although I have aright to find his jokes un-funny, I don't have a right to *criticise* him or assert he's *morally wrong* simply because I objected to the precise brand of offensiveness he delivered.

Simply being offended does not *automatically* entitle you to the moral high-ground, and the fact that the author didn't realise this is mostly what put people's noses out of joint.

&gt; What's wrong with someone liking rough-edged and edgy humour, but being offended a bit when they cross the line?

Nothing.  What's wrong with enjoying near-the-knuckle humour that will offend plenty of people, ignoring any offence they take and then expecting everyone stop and pay attention to *her* when *she* takes offence?  Everything.

&gt; In fact, it's hypocritical of FB to go out and do a show that is so self-consciously edgy and then get all pissy when someone gets offended, surely?

No, that's not hypocrisy, either.  Hypocrisy would be FB *criticising other people* for telling offensive jokes, when he's an offensive comedian himself.

Neither is it even *necessarily* morally wrong:  He's a comedian.  When he's on stage, he's at work.  His job is to entertain a room full of people who are *paying* him to do it, by crafting and maintaining an atmosphere they will find enjoyable by using a string of offensive jokes.  If you're in your office working on something for one of your clients, and another client comes into the office and starts distracting you or kicking over filing cabinets, you're perfectly justified in getting pissed with them.

Secondly, he's well-known as an offensive comedian to whom no subject is taboo, and the author *specifically wanted to see him* because she knew he'd be even *more* offensive and tasteless than he was allowed to be on TV... as did the rest of the audience.  If you get savaged by a sheep, I'll grant you that shock and outrage might be appropriate.

The draw back to allowing the electorate to decide, is that they are generally bad at making choices. Their votes are more likely to go to the better speaker rather than to the person who is most qualified or at least the most sincere in their proposals and policies.

Dear candidate,

I am extremely disappointed at the way in which the Digital Economy Bill was pushed through Parliament without proper debate. The content of this bill was undoubtedly influenced by lobbying from the music industry and pushed through by the unelected and serially untrustworthy Lord Mandelson.

In my opinion this illustrates a grave failing of the democratic process. It is hardly surprising that so many people have become disillusioned with politicians. The turnout in the forthcoming election will no doubt reflect this.

As a constituent, I would like to know that you are committed to greater transparency in politics and accountable decision-making. I'd like you to pledge support for a compulsory register of lobbyists by visiting http://www.38degrees.org.uk/sign-the-lobbying-pledge

true,[deleted],null,null,"I like the way this new Doctor is going. He remind me more of the Doctors of old than either Eccleston or Tennant, and that is a good thing. There is an *alienness* to him that has been missing in the Russell T Davies period.

That moment of anger when he realised what had been happening with the whale was almost like he was channelling Tom Baker. Tennant did anger good, but it was too human for my liking. Smith's anger seemed more cold and standoff-ish, almost removed, yet no less powerful for it.

Amy Pond is certainly growing on me too. Cute, smart, and Scottish. What's not to love?

I don't think this was quite an A in respect to story, maybe B+ for effort. We all know Moffat can do better than he did here. Truth is, there is a little bit of me worried about this new series with regards to Moffat.

His best work (*Blink* and *Girl in the Fireplace*) dealt very much with the nature of time: how it is fixed and intractable for humans, but fluid for the Doctor, and how this interaction can play out. He played with this theme to great effect in those two episodes, and brought it in for last weeks episode quite nicely too. Unfortunately, this is not a theme he can use in *every* episode, and if this one is anything to go by, his writing will suffer slightly, as it did with his other previous episodes. Don't get me wrong, I still think his 'average' episode is more than on a par with Davies' work, and I look forward to the rest of the series with eagerness.

I just hope he can do the obligatory end-of-series extravaganza better than Davies could.

Its self-publicity, nothing more. And that's a damn shame, because now people are asking 'what can I do to help Dawkins?' rather then then 'what can I do to help the victims of child abusers?'.

true,essjay2009,cnty-wales,Bristol,"&gt; Comment #478580 by Richard Dawkins on April 11, 2010 at 8:48 am 
Needless to say, I did NOT say ""I will arrest Pope Benedict XVI"" or anything so personally grandiloquent. You have to remember that The Sunday Times is a Murdoch newspaper, and that all newspapers follow the odd custom of entrusting headlines to a sub-editor, not the author of the article itself. What I DID say to Marc Horne when he telephoned me out of the blue, and I repeat it here, is that I am whole-heartedly behind the initiative by Geoffrey Robertson and Mark Stephens to mount a legal challenge to the Pope's proposed visit to Britain. Beyond that, I declined to comment to Marc Horme, other than to refer him to my 'Ratzinger is the Perfect Pope' article here: http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5341 
&gt; Here is what really happened. Christopher Hitchens first proposed the legal challenge idea to me on March 14th. I responded enthusiastically, and suggested the name of a high profile human rights lawyer whom I know. I had lost her address, however, and set about tracking her down. Meanwhile, Christopher made the brilliant suggestion of Geoffrey Robertson. He approached him, and Mr Robertson's subsequent 'Put the Pope in the Dock' article in The Guardian shows him to be ideal: 
http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5366 
The case is obviously in good hands, with him and Mark Stephens. I am especially intrigued by the proposed challenge to the legality of the Vatican as a sovereign state whose head can claim diplomatic immunity. 
&gt; Even if the Pope doesn't end up in the dock, and even if the Vatican doesn't cancel the visit, I am optimistic that we shall raise public consciousness to the point where the British government will find it very awkward indeed to go ahead with the Pope's visit, let alone pay for it.

That really depends on the stick with which you measure corruption with.  If you consider some of the scandals we've had over the past few decades.  Cash for questions, weapons sales, MP's expenses, parties redrawing boundaries to suit their own needs, the way all the major parties are funded (i.e. from semi-anonymous donors), the recent ""lobbyists for hire"" thing, etc etc.  Natch.

It may not be on the scale of a failed African state, but relative to the state of society it's not great.

I do agree with you though.  While the bill is one of the worst pieces of legislature ever to be passed, it's the fact that it was written partly by lobbyist groups that really grates with me.  The author of the submitted story mentions the pharma industry as an example but gets the analogy slightly wrong.  A more accurate analogy would be that big pharma writes a law that removes restriction on the sale of drugs.

_________________________

We've just finished the Commons proceedings on this. About 10 of us pressed objections through the committee stage. The Government was persuaded to withdraw clause 18 (which would have allowed blocking of sites like Wikileaks) and added a ""superaffirmative resolution"" rider to clauses 11-17, which basically means that the regulations for blocking internet accounts will need further consultation and debate in the next Palriament.
 
47 of us pressed our objections to vote against Third Reading. There were only 190 in favour so it could easily have been defeated, but the Conservatives were largely absent and contented themselves with criticising the process (too little time for debate etc.) while accepting the content.
 
It now goes back to the Lords, but I think will go through there tomorrow and become law.
 
I'm glad we forced the withdrawal of the dangerous clause 18 and the debate was itself an exercise in electronic democracy, with opponents feeding me arguments via my Blackberry as we went through the amendments. the battle will resume in the next Parliament, and I'll continue to resist the blocking of accounts there (if I'm still an MP, obviously). Thanks for all the interest.

From the OGC:
&gt; Suppliers may be ruled out if they fail to comply with certain minimum standards or key legal requirements, or if they fail to provide information requested. Decisions on de-selection should be [reasonable and proportionate] and the overall assessment should generally be based on a holistic analysis of all the factors, rather than one factor carrying dis-proportionate weight.Scoring should be consistent allow clear identification of reasons for rejecting suppliers. The selection process should have a clear audit trail that can stand up to external scrutiny if required. For procurements subject to the UK regulations there is an obligation for mandatory exclusion for some offences related to fraud corruption and bribery - Refer to Article 45 Guidance on Mandatory Exclusion (see below).

[Source](http://www.ogc.gov.uk/policy_and_standards_framework_supplier_selection_and_pre-qualification_guidance,_tools_and_tips_9770.asp)

&gt; Contracting Authorities must also treat as ineligible suppliers that have been convicted of offences relating to bribery, corruption or tax evasion

[source](http://www.ogc.gov.uk/introduction_to_procurement_supplier_selection_3184.asp)

Regulation 23 of the Public Contracts Regulations (2006):
&gt; “Subject to paragraph (2), a contracting authority shall treat as ineligible and shall not select an economic operator in accordance with these Regulations if the contracting authority has actual knowledge that the economic operator or its directors or any other person who has powers of representation, decision or control of the economic operator has been convicted of any of the following offences:
(c) the offence of bribery;

[source](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.ogc.gov.uk/documents/Article_45_Guidance_Mandatory_Exclusion_update_Feb_2009.pdf)

There's loads more information on the OGC website about ethical procurement and selection during tender stages.

The NHS Trusts are not complete privatization but they do introduce the profit motive in to the NHS. They were first introduced by Thatcher really, [from wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_National_Health_Service_%28England%29#Reforms_under_the_Thatcher_government):

&gt;From this review and in 1989, two white papers Working for Patients and Caring for People were produced. These outlined the introduction of what was termed the ""internal market"", which was to shape the structure and organisation of health services for most of the next decade. In spite of intensive opposition from the BMA, who wanted a pilot study or the ""reforms"" in one region, the untried untested internal market was introduced. In 1990, the National Health Service &amp; Community Care Act (in England) defined this ""internal market"", whereby Health Authorities ceased to run hospitals but ""purchased"" care from their own or other authorities' hospitals. Certain GPs became ""fund holders"" and were able to purchase care for their patients. The ""providers"" became NHS trusts, which encouraged competition but also increased local differences.

Also on that page is how Blair dropped Labour's opposition to the NHS internal market - and they continue to advocate the internal market system even now.

As for what I think socialism is, well it is about providing everyone with equal opportunities and welfare, via wealth distribution - taking the power away from a few business owners and instead putting it in the hands of the citizens. If you are interested I'd recommend reading [The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists](http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3608) on the foundation of the Labour party, it's out of copyright and I think you can get it for free from some organizations (try the trade unions for example).

I agree with you that a lot of the cuts, tax credits, NI increases, etc. amount to pushing peas about the plate. Take the Conservatives' new tax cut on married couples, it will save each couple approximately £200 a year, yet will cost the government a fair amount of money, but ultimately the cost of the added bureaucracy in making sure the break is administered only to those eligible etc. just makes the entire policy stupid.

I have no problem with CCTV cameras on streets, the amount of times footage from CCTV cameras or stills makes it on the tv or net as evidence of a crime or for calling for witnesses is staggering. What the hell is wrong with them? I'm not going to say 'If you do nothing wrong you have nothing to fear' because that's crap, but genuinely, what harm does it do? Its not like they're breaching my privacy in my own home...I'm walking in a public place, anyone can see me anyway...I have no problem that the police can call up footage of me walking through a public street at some point in the future...what the hell harm does it do me? It only seems to help solve and possibly prevent crimes.

DNA Database: I feel its morally questionable to hold the DNA of people arrested but not actually convicted of a crime, purely because this can be seen as punishing people for being arrested even if they were innocent. Honestly, I would be more happy if EVERYONE was on the DNA database. What harm does it cause? Until there's some kind of technology which allows you to do *something* with the DNA other than match it to a crime scene I don't have any problem with it. And yes, this means I would perfectly happily have my DNA on the database right now. It *does* help solve crimes and it *does* help rule out witnesses making the job of the police easier.

Why do people object to the DNA database but not the fingerprint database?

I don't object to the ID cards on anything but cost- if they replaced driving licences, national insurance card and integrated it *into* a passport so we only had to carry one piece of ID around with us I would happily have one purely for convenience... again, I don't see what the problem is with carrying a card around with my photo and some biometric identity on it. Its not going to be mandatory to have one and it certainly will never be mandatory to have to carry it. It would be more convenient for me if everyone had one; I'd prefer it if everyone had a driving licence for ID reasons, but as not everyone has a driving licence isn't this just a reasonable way of everyone having the same form of ID for going out to bars etc?

So basically... the only objection I have to any of the schemes in their current format is cost. People here seem to have some kind of intrinsic objection to them on the basis that they undermine some kind of freedom...what freedom?

Do you honestly feel that your freedoms are being curtailed when you walk through central London and see cameras on the streets? And for reference, I'm not one of the idiots who says CCTV cameras makes me feel safer. I simply believe that criminals are found and prosecuted more successfully when there is CCTV evidence.

2) Okay so say they manage to incompetently lose some DNA information? What are the bad guys going to do with it?

3) The Government doesn't sell biometric information. It might be incompetent but it has not and will never sell that kind of information. DVLA data which is sold is, as far as I'm aware, completely not about individuals. My *father* buys the information because he runs a car dealership and from what I've seen it only contains information about cars and their history in accidents etc. I don't think you can even find out the current owner of a car, but I may be wrong (I say this because I believe only the Police have that database).

ID Cards are one of the things I'm least enthusiastic about, but if they're optional and they're useful I don't see a problem. Like I said if they replace my driving licence with something more useful its only a good thing for me, personally, but we'll sidestep that. I don't really feel strongly about it either way.

Whilst I agree there's reason to be sceptical and resistant to Government having too much power, its not in our interests to blindly inhibit the Government's ability to do its job (Criminal Prosecution, Security etc) just because we don't like the idea of the big bad Government having more to work with.

The issue is that they've got themselves into a situation where they are unable to find equivalent (or rather better) working income that would compensate them for not having their benefits (don't forget they get their benefits for sitting on their arse, having to work takes them away from their current 'day job').

There are a number of solutions, some of which work, some of which don't. What seems to be a recurring theme with the benefit trap is a combination of tax negating the benefits from work (which applies to unskilled people often on long-term sick) and a personal situation where the people in question would be unable to replicate or otherwise improve on their benefit in any normal work environment.

For the former, dropping income tax and NICs completely at above minimum wage (and dropping benefits to suit) would mean that more people would take minimum wage jobs.

For the latter (which is the case described in TFA) an assisted support scheme based on tax relief would work better. It costs a lot of money to collect tax, distribute benefits, which are then taxed and used to distribute benefits. It's a genuine HMG Rube Goldberg device.

true,essjay2009,cnty-wales,Bristol,"&gt; DVLA data which is sold is, as far as I'm aware, completely not about individuals. My father buys the information because he runs a car dealership and from what I've seen it only contains information about cars and their history in accidents etc. I don't think you can even find out the current owner of a car, but I may be wrong (I say this because I believe only the Police have that database).

That's not correct.  Officially the DVLA should only be disclosing information on owners (names, adresses and contact information) to select partners who have a specific need for that data and have been vetted.  Initially this was supposed to be for use by parking enforcement companies so they could issues fines and insurance companies etc.  Unfortunately the vetting procedures were never fully implemented, so pretty much anyone with a letter head can pay £2.50 per record.  I don't know if you remember but Castrol, the oil company, were heavily criticised a while back (sometime last year IIRC) for focused advertising using data they bought from the DVLA.

&gt; There's isn't anything really nefarious you can do with DNA to my knowledge, nor am I aware of anything nefarious you might be able to do in the future. Short of cloning me to frame me for a crime..come on.

There's already a lot that can be done with DNA, such as inferring family relationships, genealogy etc.  I think suggesting that someone would frame you using a DNA record is missing the point.  I'm more concerned about what will happen when that data gets released to commercial organisations, as it inevitably will, and how they can mine said data and exploit it.  And it's not lost data that concerns me, it's the nicely packaged data that will be sold to fund these initiatives that worries me.

&gt; Whilst I agree there's reason to be sceptical and resistant to Government having too much power, its not in our interests to blindly inhibit the Government's ability to do its job (Criminal Prosecution, Security etc) just because we don't like the idea of the big bad Government having more to work with.

I'm yet to see any convincing evidence that these measures will help the government do its job.  Given that the government has lost and sold data that we've entrusted them with in the past, it's a big ask considering they've not actually provided any tangible benefits other than vague mentions of security - for me, that's not good enough.

It's fine that you don't have a problem with these measures, it's your prerogative and I certainly won't hold that against you (actually, yours is a somewhat refreshing viewpoint on Reddit - hence my upvoting your comments *as per Reddiquette* despite not agreeing with them).

They are more likely to listen to the public and do a good job, else they'd never get elected again, and are probably relatively uncorrupt because of their current lack of influence (corporations would be lobbying for their interests with the lib dems because they are less likely to sway a vote in their limited numbers).

* To send a warning to whichever party does get in.
* To increase the chances of a hung parliament, where they *will* have some power.

This is a story on schools for very young children.  These children are used to speaking the language of the home, and have not been exposed to society as a whole.

I've voted for the Lib Dems my entire life and I think if people thought for themselves the Lib Dems would already be in power, their policies benefit the majority. 

An example of the influence of the media is for example, The Sun, who are currently backing the conservatives who will, and have in the past, made it more difficult to live on the minimum wage and given the rich tax breaks. The reason the Sun are backing the Tories? Because Rupert Murdoch wants them in power, that's it, most of the readers of the Sun will see no benefits under the Tories, in fact their lives will (overall) be harder, as the majority of Sun readers are on relatively low incomes.

The problem with the UK is that people see politics as a sport 'my family has always voted for labour, so I will too' and only change their mind if newspapers tell them too, they don't even read the policies of the parties they're voting for (I kid you not).
