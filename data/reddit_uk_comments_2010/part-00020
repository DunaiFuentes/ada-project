true,IOIOOIIOIO,null,null,"&gt;It sounds like you're complaining about the requirement for a driving licence - are you against that also?

I'm against comparing driving a car to the right to protect and defend oneself, family, and/or neighbors.

&gt;If the law is changed so that possession and/or use of a gun without the relevant piece of paper for it equals instant jail time, wouldn't a major proportion of criminals think twice about not -just- pulling the trigger on someone, but obtaining an unlicensed gun in the first place.

Historically, no.   The already-accepted level of risk associated with choosing to perpetrate various types of violent crime is not significantly increased by penalties for clerical errors on the weapons used.

Attaching penalties and long sentences to the criminal misuse of guns, though, does seem to have some impact... but that only affects criminals and so doesn't satisfy those seeking to control the law-abiding gun owners.

&gt;And with the paperwork barrier (not a block) to obtaining a gun, less legal possession, and less theft of legal guns to boot.

It doesn't really work out that way in practice.  There's some evidence that policies such as selective permitting for firearms purchasing and barring felons from owning weapons is actually what _creates_ the demand for untracable/paperless black-market guns.   But, again, a system where the paperwork is a mere formality and not a barrier to obtaining a firearm doesn't satisfy those wishing to control law-abiding gun owners.

There's also a historical problem with registration schemes such as you describe turning into databases for subsequent confiscation/disarmament efforts.   Given that the creation of such a database has no clear benefit (i.e., keeping track of law-abiding gun owners doesn't overlap much with keeping track of criminal gun users) and significant risks for misuse, it would be prudent to oppose the creation of such a database.   With no database, no would-be tyrant is tempted to use it for ill.

&gt;You're free to own a gun with a permit, as much as drive a car. 

What are your thoughts on a similar permitting system to buy a book or post something on the internet, or speak aloud in public?   Or perhaps a system where you could give copies of all your private papers to the authorities and then be issued a permit to be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures.

&gt;But a gun is specifically a weapon and so, where a fine applies to driver of the unlicensed car, jail time applies to the holder/user of the unlicensed gun.

You only need a license to drive on public roads (and then only if you recognize the statutory authority of the government to limit your right to free assembly/travel).   You can own a car and drive it all you want on your own property without a bit of paperwork because it's understood that you aren't being a danger to anyone else.

Using that standard ""not a danger to anyone else"" your argument for demanding permitting of law-abiding gun owners falls flat (and demanding permitting of criminals is farcical as criminals are not known for their obedience to legal code).

&gt;For actual freedom you need to stop unlimited spending by Goldman, Exxon et al in your elections.

these are all very real possibility granted they may seem less likely than story's you see from the us but then they have 10x the number of people.

then there are the stats that help put the point across too.

new your and Chicago had out right hand gun bans for longer than the UK there crime rate has increased over this time.

states with the most open gun laws actually have some of the lowest crime rates.

i believe it is Texas that has researched the effects of its introduction of CC and they have found that the people that apply for CC with the police are statistically less likely to shoot innocent individual and less likely to commit crime than any criminal/non-cc civilian and the POLICE

there have been correlation that show that CC states have seen some crimes decrease since CC was introduced. 

&gt;You seem to think that criminals stop work when people have guns.

criminal never stop work but they do, do risk assessments if you have an armed population and many that have cc and in most cases this means additional good training they switch targets robbing the houses which may fetch a few hundred is now not worth it.

end of the day any attack on my house and my family should not have the out come in the hands of the criminal attacker that's no way to run a country.

I do not think that the public have been given enough information regarding the conditions of their deployment.              I question the degree to which safety checks have verified that they are not potentially fatal to sufferers of epilepsy/seizure disorders or heart problems.    It would be a great surprise if any testing has been carried out upon people for taser usage who suffer epilepsy etc.     The sole figures available are probably based upon trial, error and luck.  
The point,  do not stand next to someone who is about to be potentially tasered,  needs clarification.   For example, is there any possibility of the use in a protest situation in a city.  If so, it is very easy scenario to be just a peaceful protestor or person caught up as a person going back to the office.       On the whole, the public need more information upon the usage, circumstances of the taser.    The films of some of the misusage in America are far from reassuring.  
In Britain, the worst thing that could happen is that the police become armed to the gummels, unapproachable.    
 On your list of points,  a major missing factor is reassurance and education as to the use of the taser to the public.

I recently have started re-watching some of my favorite episodes from the 2005+ series and I have to say I find her to be quite annoying more often then not. I think her being my favorite comanion just stuck with me (like Eccleston being my favorite Doctor until Series 3 with Tennant). 

I can really only judge by the 2005+ series as I have not watched enough of the Classic series to form any opinions on companions. 

* Rory - I was thrilled to hear Rory would be an official companion next season.
* Captain Jack - I guess he could technically be called a companion. He is the only reason I started watching Torchwood. I hope he makes an appearance in next season of Doctor Who. 
* River Song - I guess we can call her a companion also. I love the mystery behind her. I hope some of the mystery behind River Song is answered next season. 
* Donna Nobel - I pretty much hated her until Turn Left. I think thats what RTD was going for up until then though.
* Amy Pond - I love her, both her looks and acting. I hope she sticks around for a few seasons. I'm not entirely sure we have learned everything we need to know about her yet.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"That picture of David Cameron was way too big and way too close for my liking.

The problem with benefits is twofold. First, there are unrealistic amounts of expenses being claimed by people who shouldn't be able to get it - namely people living in huge houses with large families. Obviously there'd be issues trying to fit those with 5 or 6 kids into anything less than a 2 bedroom house, but still:

We need to find a way of reducing the costs imposed by those who are gunning specifically for living off benefits when they would otherwise be healthy or relatively so. For example, those who want to have 10 - 15 kids so they can live off child benefits or move into bigger homes paid for by the council in nicer areas. I don't mean cutting housing benefits across the board, but a more logical application of it would make sense.

The other part of the problem with benefits - those who work are too jealous of the fact that there are those who don't. It's hard to admit, but a lot of people supporting these cuts to benefits don't like how someone can basically have 6 or more months out of work and do what they want while they slave away at work.
It's not entirely a culture of joblessness, there also exists a culture of greed and jealousy. SOME people backing the cuts genuinely believe they will help, and maybe they will, maybe they won't, but there are too many people who want to make an example out of benefit cheats because they have to work for their money and they'd be happy to hurt those legitimate claims in the meantime.

What people need to bear in mind is that these are all cuts being made with PR spin in mind. If you look at the cuts proposed - they are all so far being dressed up to be palatable. For example:

Benefit cuts/chasing up - they're 'out to get the cheats'. As I said above, some would find that suits them perfectly. Just remember these same changes will affect you in future when you need to use these services.

Funding cuts to departments - we 'can't afford to live this way so we all have to tighten our purse strings'. Is this really true? As a part of a larger economic recovery platform, I can't help but feel that scaling back the state during a potentially dangerous recession is ideology when caution should be applied.

Telling the nation that we can't afford this any more is a way to turn these cuts into a populist movement - if everyone 'gets it', then it's not as harmful to the party reputation as it would be if nobody understood. What we have to bear in mind is that while the Coalition believes this is right, Labour had another way, and the fact another way of doing these cuts conceivably exists means that we should assess things closer instead of jumping on the Coalition bandwagon.

Benefit cheats are a tiny part of the problem. Whilst every little may help, there's bigger cost problems to the UK right now.",0,1281660676,null,0,false,0,c0wndhx,t3_d0hwl,t1_c0wndhx,t3_d0hwl,null,1426419978,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I believe that CCTV or any other medium for tracking people is both necessary and inevitable. However, I do see the process as Orwellian as it stands.  
  
The issue here is the idea of human involvement, which extends to the idea of misuse and a 'police state'. But what if we remove, or offset, the human involvement?  
 
e.g: as soon as data is recorded by CCTV, software registers each person it 'sees'. It then blurs the face, labels as 'anonymous' and encrypts. This would be the de facto state - everyone would be unrecognisable and no tracking would happen. Then if a crime occurs, human intervention is allowed: a nominated body (police in this case) are allowed to 'unlock' suspicious persons in footage. Here, obviously, is where the process could be abused. But this 'unlocking' would be transparent and would need sufficient justification for doing so.  
  
We can extend this idea to politics in the form of an 'unlock activity' referendum - citizens vote in the suspicious activities or crimes that warrant 'unlocking' of people. This further reduces abuse of the system. For example, assume that people vote in unlocking 'if a CCTV system 'recognises' a deadly weapon on an anonymous person.

Also it assumes if you have parents with incomes above the thresholds that they are going to be happy to give you £3k a year to live on even though you are 18-21 (I mean how long are parents meant to support their children for?)

In the current economy it is much harder to get part time work, and for subjects like Engineering and Physics etc. it is nigh on impossible to balance academic work and part-time employment.

I would recommend increasing the loan available to each student (a minimum of £6k should just about suffice, it's still less than JSA, should be paid back eventually and students can't sign on or get medical(glasses, prescriptions etc.) or housing Benefits atm). At least that way everyone would have the freedom and independence to go, rather than depending upon their parents support.

Add to this the poor prospects after graduation even in 'good' subjects like Engineering which had one of the highest graduate unemployment rates (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10477551) and the fact that only the rich can afford to take unpaid internships and you have a perfect storm resulting in the professions becoming the domain only of the rich and privileged.

true,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"I'm just going into my second year, and the debts are from the tuition fees (paid by a loan from the Student Loans Company) and the maintenance loan (also from Student Loans Company). The SLC is public-owned so at least private individuals aren't profiting off of it, well until the government sells the SLC for quick cash I suppose.

As I mentioned in [my comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/d0qn7/new_university_students_expect_debts_averaging/c0wog3j) the main problem is that the maintenance loan is around £3.5k a year if your parents are above a certain amount (~£60k household income IIRC) and it increases to a max of £5k if your parents earn less than that. 

If you are poorer &lt;£25k household income in England then you can get a grant of £3k a year as well. Which tapers off as you approach £40k after which you get nothing.

The loans are slightly larger (and much more livable on) if you are studying in London.

The problem is that in the South-East especially, salaries are higher but so is the cost of living, combine this with the fact that the SLC bureaucracy doesn't do a very good job of taking siblings into account (I have two other siblings, one the same age as me, one a year younger all going to uni) or debts due to divorce/mortgages etc. and it means that the expected parental contribution is often unrealistically high.

This is also dependent on your parents actually being happy to support you through university for three years (or four years in the case of MEng, MMath courses).

I mean there is no way I could have afforded private school, and yet my parents are now expected to pay a similar amount towards my education suddenly and without their support there is no way to go to university at all.

We are specialising half of our workforce in specific areas and there simply isn't enough jobs to give them all each year, especially right now.

&gt;In a press statement, Mr Pickles said the commission's research functions would stop and councils would be able to ask private companies to carry out audits. There would also be a ""new audit framework"" for local health services.

According to the article the Audit Commission currently overlooks £200 billion spent by 11,000 local authorities and this development throws up a lot of questions.

What body is going to ensure that standards are applied equally across the board if the work is done be private firms?  
What level of accountability are there firms going to have to the general public?  
How is the suitability of firms to do the work going to be assessed? Particularly what safeguards will there be in place to ensure that this doesn't turn into a situation where some councils will employ their friends who will overlook discrepancies in return for a nice fat pay-cheque?  
Who is going to audit council spending on auditing services?  
What level of communication is there going to be between different companies auditing different councils, particularly given that in many cases the companies concerned may well be rivals for those contracts?  

I can't see anything positive coming from this. It looks like a recipe for less transparency, lower efficiency, higher costs and a serious potential for fraud. I can only think they have done this to cut central government spending without any regard for local government spending. If the cost spirals out of control as a result of this, as it well might, then that will be added to council tax rather than income tax.  

I think we are going to end up paying more for a lower quality service- but at least it won't be on central government's balance sheet, and after all that's the whole point of the exercise.

That's the enacting clause to every law passed by Parliament. All but the last two words exalt hereditary and unaccountable rule.

The Magna Carta, the English Civil war, these were conflicts by the aristocracy against the King. Establishment on establishment violence to grant themselves more freedoms.  The vox populi have never overthrown the old order like the French or the Americans did.  The old order, with its Dukes and Earls and Lords, and landed estates persists. The richest man in the country is the Duke of Westminster, rich for no reason other than the land his title bequeaths him. The Crown technically owns all the land in the country.  The Crown even has its own religion, the Church of England and has the constitutional right to veto laws and fire the executive.

I'm not saying that Britain isn't a democracy. What I'm saying is that the nation, is still beholden to the aristocracy and its associated class structure and that it is consequently not a meritocratic society. 

I used to think that this arrangement at least led to stability and common sense Government, but Blair's insane war and police state, carried out under the purview of Her Majesty and her Lords and Ladies, reveals that the old order is a parasitic drag on hard-working ""commoners"" that ultimately does nothing for the country.

Standards are applied equally across the board by International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), and by the Accounts and Audit Regulations Act 2003, which also dictates the level of accountability that firms must have to the general public, things like responding to a challenge to the accounts by a member of the public, and forming an opinion on the Value for Money provided by the council.

ISAs dictate very tight rules which must be followed in order by the auditor, such as around the amount of work to be done to be able to form an opinion, and ethical rules, which seek to avoid the situation you described.  Chartered Accountants are bound by an ethical code they sign up to, which if broken, could result in being struck off by their body and unable to work as an accountant.  This does happen.

The whole process is overseen by the Audit Committee, which is made up of councillors from the ruling party and the opposition, so there is a level of scrutiny there.

Not sure about the level of communication between different firms, but there is unlikely to be much required anyway, there may well be some kind of framework agreement where communication is needed.  Note that currently private firms do audit work on a subcontract basis for the Audit Commission on many local authorities already.

This is all in relation to the audit of council accounts, what I'm not sure about currently is how specific inspection work will be done, as this was traditionally the Audit Commission's area.

true,astatine,eng-yorkshire,S.S.R.S.Y.,"It's the morning after the last general election, and you're the Lib Dem party. The House has more Conservative than Labour MPs, neither has enough for a majority, and the Conservatives have significantly more.

Here are your three options.

1. *Let the Conservatives form a minority government.* This bowls along for a bit, decisions are unpopular in the House, political chaos. Labour will stone-wall anything they don't like and try to shoot down anything neutral just for the sake of it. Election is called within a year. Labour are still getting the blame for almost everything, Tories campaign on ""you want a strong, decisive government"", which is the natural home of right-wing parties.  Result: Conservative Majority within a year, Lib Dems get nothing but blame for the hassle caused.

2. *Form a coalition with Labour.* As we know now, Labour considered a coalition to be unthinkable and had no ideas how to put one together. Some common ground on economics might have brought them together, but Labour's illiberal civil liberties attitude would have ripped the coalition apart in very little time. There'd be a considerably more bickering government than the one we have now, and their history with the Civil Service would enable Labour to shut the Lib Dems out of enacting any policy. Result: Coalition falls apart in about a year (which won't be long enough to get a referendum on electoral reform), election called, Conservatives capitalise on how crap you both were and get a majority. Lib Dems get nothing but frustration, embarrassment, wasted time. 

3. *Form a coalition with the Conservatives.* Not so much the best option as ""least bad"". You were getting a government led by Conservatives in the long term regardless of which option you picked, might as well get what you can out of it. Give up any chance of seriously affecting economic policy, but you can still hold the Conservatives to their opposition to Labour's ""if it looks at you funny, make it illegal"" attitude and try to drag them towards the centre. Result: Coalition probably doesn't last a full term before it comes apart but gets a few things the Lib Dem way, which is more than you were getting with any other option.",0,1281867916,null,0,false,0,c0wtlqs,t3_d19vk,t1_c0wtlqs,t1_c0wtin5,null,1426422914,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

true,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"Guaranteed Minimum Income set at something like £14k

This would help people spend more if they weren't worried about unemployment leaving them destitute etc. and spending more creates more demand and makes profits for companies which in turn creates more jobs and strengthens the economy. It could be funded through a higher rate of tax on those earning £100k+ and higher corporation taxes.

It might seem a bit crazy but even Milton Friedman suggested having a negative income tax - it is a core component of stable capitalism, without it the wealth accumulates at the top (especially when the economy stops growing and thus becomes zero sum, if it's not growing then if someone gets richer it is at the expense of someone else in a sense) and this accumulation means the vast majority of people have less money to spend and therefore cut back and start saving as they get worried about unemployment (it's even worse without a welfare state where people must also save for catastrophic medical costs etc.)

This reduction in spending then causes the mass market to fail as people aren't buying enough. Things that have a set overhead cost (like a cinema/gym etc. where they are paying for the building so as demand increases the price can actually become cheaper) then have to increase their prices which means even less people use them and they eventually go out of business causing more unemployment. Which in turn reduces spending!

So you have an economic death spiral really. I liken it to hunting animals, the rich can cut their taxes and not redistribute some of the wealth and that is like hunting the animal to extinction as it eventually leads to massive recessions, or they can redistribute a fraction of their wealth (they still get to stay really rich, there is still incentive to succeed and free enterprise) yet the market stays stable.

The problem is that too many people have a simplistic notion of the economy where bad times mean austerity and cutting back, but that just creates more unemployment and makes it worse.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I couldn't narrow it down to one piece, but rather a broad change in policy.

Firstly, I don't agree with these 'emergency cuts'. For a start, most of them will cost us more money in the long run, under Thatcher government spending actually increased as the maintenance of Ofwat, etc. to regulate the newly privatized industries eventually costs more than the short-term kick of capital we gained. It's also the same thing with unemployment now, ultimately the government might as well invest in construction projects, etc. now (for social housing, say) while it is cheap, as we are either going to pay people to work, or pay them to sit on the dole, we can't just pretend the unemployment problem doesn't exist and the people aren't just going to vanish.

I'd also back the introduction of Negative Income Tax and a basic income to simplify the benefits system and also provide good support for people. This combined with the government investment to keep people in work should help lessen the effects of the recession - for the last thing we want to do is make people start drastically saving, as this makes the overproduction problem worse and so the unemployment worse, etc.

In unrelated policies I'd support making an online public library so all books are published online too (with Google's help this is quite possible), and also extend the NHS to include free gym membership (as I imagine it will offset the cost of heart surgery, etc.) and full dentistry and eyecare (it's crazy that a prisoner has it paid for whilst citizens must pay), nationalizing the utilities to save money on regulation. And, as mentioned above, using the unemployed to build new social housing, thus actually achieving something productive in the recession.

Ultimately, these problems are not simple or easy to solve, and we need to plan how to solve them carefully. The recession is basically caused by a problem in overproduction (the original causes are complicated), so then the sale of goods for these businesses which overproduced is no longer profitable (and worsened by competition) and so they have to lay people off, however this causes people to cut their consumption and start saving, which spreads the overproduction crisis to other goods which then worsens the problem. I'd really recommend reading A Very Short Introduction To Capitalism if you are interested, if you are going to discuss national debt, unemployment, etc. it really is necessary to have a basic understanding - otherwise it's a bit like going to a used car salesman when knowing nothing about cars, you're just going to let yourself be misled.",0,1281950909,null,0,true,0,c0ww4q8,t3_d1gl7,t1_c0ww4q8,t3_d1gl7,null,1426424093,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Granted, I moved here from Southern California (and Texas before that) with 24-hour Wal-Marts, shops that only close on Christmas and New Year's Day, drive-through liquor stores and banking, plus the silly laws of dry counties (e.g., the county that Jack Daniel's is based in cannot sell Jack Daniels or booze of any kind), so I appreciate there are relatively outdated laws everywhere. 

Another thing: early store closings. How are people supposed to shop after their normal day job? City centre shops close at 5, then the owners complain when a Tesco or Sainsbury's takes all their business away. Maybe they should work with a trade organization to get laws passed that allow them to stay open until 6 or 7? Then people won't have to get their greetings cards, clothes or electricals from a Tesco that closes at 8, 10, or never? Separate issue, I know, but it still annoys me after 6+ years here.

You should probably try out Exhibition cider at least once at the Coronation Tap in Clifton, and also in Clifton is Amoeba, which has an excellent selection of ridiculously strong and tasty continental beers.

Food: The Thai place on Park Street is nice, and stocks Bath Ales, bonus. There is an Italian place at the top of Park Street that is very nice and is quite cheap outside of peak hours (they have signs outside saying when their cheap menu is on).

Zero Degrees is oft-recommended (restaurant and micro brewery), personally I think the management are cunts and now avoid it.

Comedy: There are a few places, my favourite is [Choppo](http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/group.php?gid=5012013955&amp;ref=ts). It only runs during term-time, and it's a testing ground for new comedians or new material, so quality is quite variable, but in the run-up to Edinburgh they sometimes get some big names, and it's only two quid.

[No, it doesn't](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class).  At least, not historically.

The middle class is the class of skilled artisans and professionals, as distinct from the lower class (labourers, servants, etc) and the upper class (independently wealthy, aristocracy, etc).

With the increasing improvement of the average lifestyle in most Western countries since the industrial revolution, the abolition of serfdom and share-cropping and the fact that even wealthy people tend to own the same sorts of possessions (houses, cars, computers, etc) as commoners, the middle class has expanded until - technically - pretty much everyone is middle class these days.

The trouble is that people like the author use ""middle class"" to mean ""average"", but it does not mean (and has never meant) that.

Equally, calling independently-wealthy politicians and their aristocratic wives ""middle class"" is offensively ridiculous to everyone who doesn't own a country mansion and a flat in London and take weekends in the Mediterranean on a whim, but when you're criticising someone else's use of a phrase it's important to make sure *you* use it correctly.",0,1281961690,null,0,false,0,c0wwblj,t3_d1h25,t1_c0wwblj,t3_d1h25,null,1426424182,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The library is also easy. The first question is why do we want to do this.

I would suggest it is to increase the availability and use of library services to the general public. 

That has 2 clear metrics 

* Availability

* Use

1 seems obvious its on the internet then it is more available. But that is the point we say that now but how available is the internet. Have we implemented this using something stupid (silverlight/vbscript). So we create a requirement to measure the percentage of the population able to access the current services. 

Lets say 50% of people can now get to a library due to transportation ability etc etc the rest have difficulties. 

Placing the services online has a cost so availability needs to increase by a figure that justify that cost. So we want 75% of people to be able to gain access to these services in say 5 years. Not just can people access the services by the internet (who knows it may be obsolete by then) but also is the tech used still the right one for the job. IE6 only is not likly to be the best choice 5 yrs from now. 

2 use: We also want to increse use of the library this can be both online and real visits as one may lead to the other so we need to measure how many people are using the libraries now and how many in 5 years. 

The important thing is what happens in 5 years if this dose not work. Well the law is cancelled but the MPs and Public may still think they need to achieve the original goals. So debate starts as to why this did not work. New solutions are proposed goto step 1.

Now I think your real question is what about laws that trully have hard to measure goals. Well that is the point. The idea of this is to limit legislation. Or at least to force legislation to require clear thought and analysis before implementation. If MPs cannot come up with a measurable goal then maybe they need to rethink. 

I like to think of drugs laws as the best example of how this would work. Drugs were banned with the goal of reducing use and improving the health of the nation. 

Well if that was the goal it would sure as hell have failed the tests later on. I can see MPs and the Daily Mail arguing for different reasons why it failed and new laws with different ways of implementing the laws would pop up every few years. 

But eventually it would become clear that the best way to reduce drug use and improve health is to educate and treat victims. While removing the illeagal profit motive in the drug trade.

true,rbnc,cnty-wales,Wales. Living in Germany.,"Either way the person who donates doesn't have more money after donating, they still have less money, no magical money appears anywhere.



Let's say Mr. Smith earns £1,000,000 net this year. On all of his income over £500,000 he taxed 50%.


In this scenario in total he gets £750,000. £250,000 goes to the tax man. And the charity gets £0.


If he donates £250,000 to charity. His net income is £750,000. So he gets taxed 50% all of the portion above £500,000, which is £250,000. In total, gross, he gets £612,500. 


In this scenario in total he gets £612,500. £125,000 goes to the tax man. And the charity gets £250,000

So in the first scenario, he gets £125,000 more and no money goes to charity.

The second scenario he gets £125,000 than he would have had he not donated but the charity gets £250,000. So just by forfeiting £125,000, he gives the charity £250,000.

Well a survey found that 60-70% of Iraqi children now have a  psychological condition. 5 million children are orphans. That's a whole generation of Iraqis ravaged by war. This will affect them for generations to come and will affect us in the future by terrorist attacks and poor relations with many countries. Is that a price worth paying for? 

Was a better way? Difficult answer, though we could of tried to bring down Saddam from within, at least partly, as he had a lot of enemies in Iraq.

Surprisingly enough, there are plenty of people who don't want to faff around growing their own crop - they might not have gardens or grow areas, might not want their house to stink of weed or might not have the patience.

There are plenty of tobacco smokers, and yet there aren't too many people growing their own tobacco, are there? 

There are lots of wine and beer drinkers, and yet home-brewing is still a niche market despite the fact that it is simpler and less risky (in terms of ruining the product) than growing tobacco or weed. 

There are even people who grow their own vegetables (very easy), but most prefer to go to the supermarket to get their produce.

Another anecdotal story, but when I lived in Richmond ( Surrey ) my landlady got clamped over unpaid parking fees on her own driveway, the guys parked behind her car to stop her reversing out as they applied said clamp. 

Anyway the guy who lived in the flat below me ( Dave, an ex marine ) saw this happening, rushed out to his van and grabbed his own wheel clamp ( he was an electrician with a lot of expensive gear in his van ) and in-turn clamped the clamper's van for parking illegal on my landladies driveway.  

Hilarity ensued and a big stand-off erupted on the driveway between my landlady ( a sixty year old woman who took no shit from anyone ) and the clamper's with no one budging an inch. Dave and I sat on the front steps all afternoon drinking cups of tea and taking the piss out of the clamper's. 

Cut to a council official arrived with the Police who refused to do anything as it was a civil matter ( or something, can't remember their terminology to be honest. )  and the stand-off continued now pulling quite a crowd of onlookers. It was only resolved hours later when a journalist turned up from the local press. The council, of course, then removed the clamp in record time and Dave let them out to cheers from the crowd.  

Stand-off over, the landladies car was locked firmly in her garage from then on in. Two weeks later however the council got their revenge by pulling down her street facing 10ft brick garden wall after deeming it unsafe to pedestrians passing by. There were tree roots growing through it so yeah, it was kinda unsafe. But still... fuckers. 

Still though as she said it was worth every penny to see these clamper's given a shot of their own medicine and squirming all afternoon.

true,TheMemo,cnty-uk,Bristol,"&gt; Tobacco isn't easy to grow or cure

It's easier than weed, there are roughly the same pest problems (different pests, though). Tobacco works far better than skunk at being grown outdoors, it is a more resilient plant than modern high-strength skunk strains. Curing can be difficult, but it's a skill like any other (depending on how you choose to cure, air curing is as easy as pie - and is just the same as curing weed). 

&gt; home brewing is very very difficult to get right, and all to easy to get disastrously wrong - maybe even blow your house up.

I had to laugh about this - home beer brewing or winemaking is pretty damn safe and has been for decades. Even distilling is now pretty safe - you can get countertop air distillers that take 2 hours for 40%. You're about 100 years out of date with your estimation of the dangers. Modern technology, gotta love it. Brewing, winemaking, distilling are all pretty foolproof if you read the instructions and don't get impatient.

&gt; a large number of people will grow it because it's so painlessly straightforward.

If only it were, I used to smoke a lot of the stuff and have many friends who do. It is not as straightforward to grow as you might think, as we have all discovered. It's not a plant you can leave to its own devices if you want any decent strength crop - you have to be really anal about light, heat, water, ventilation and ensuring that some of your plants don't change sex, and many other factors. It requires a good investment in time, to experiment with growing conditions, and around 3 months to grow (for more recent 'quick' strains) or longer. In that 3 months, you will have to spend considerable time looking for warning signs every day. The stronger the strain, the more fussy the plant is (rule of thumb). There's also the cost of indoor growing equipment (lights, ventilation, heaters) and the electricity that they consume. At least tobacco grows outdoors pretty well.

Bearing in mind, I am talking about the 'skunk'-type weed that is most frequently sold in Europe, not the 'grass' weed that I had experience of in the US, which seems to be able to grow anywhere (but is not very potent).",0,1282058497,null,0,false,0,c0x06pv,t3_d23bm,t1_c0x06pv,t1_c0x03r8,null,1426426026,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"I would agree that it would be good to free the police up, but the question of letting people run their own plant farm creates a shedload of bureaucracy with it.

In a nutshell, people want it legalised so they can grow and/or use their own. There's not much of a concern on if it is taxable or whatnot, and if it was legalised, I have a suspicion there would be a significant majority who would resort to growing their own or be purchasing from someone local as opposed to buying it from shops or licensed dealers simply because I feel those who have surplus will resort to selling it, as they do now, for money.

The problem emerges in that trying to make this a legal and taxable commodity is potentially going to cost more than it gains as there are people who would sell their surplus for personal gain because they know there is no way they can realistically be traced, and with the legalisation of it, there are significantly more important matters for the police.

Everyone has the right to do what they feel, if they want to smoke it or whatever, I'm not questioning that. What I'm saying is that simply saying legalise it without thinking about how to control it, especially if you want to use the argument that it's good for the economy to tax it, simply won't work. There is a lot to consider, and I've never seen an arguement take it beyond the 'I want to grow and smoke my own' viewpoint in a serious manner.

Perhaps the only really appropriate way of doing it would be to require a license be held to grow it and trade in it and requiring the trader to return a percentage of profits to the government in tax.

All my proposal would do is make it legal for someone to grow a couple of plants for there own consumption or sale, a level at which it would cost more to recover the tax than you would get in income. In just the same way you could theoretically make a small batch of wine from grapes grown in your garden and sell/give a few bottles away.

If you wanted to grow a green house full of the stuff, then it would need to be licensed and taxed, not to raise revenue, but to cover the cost of quality control, licensing and policing the market. What the aim is here is to bring cannabis production out of dodgy warehouses staffed by illegal immigrants, and into the open. It is possible to do this with alcohol and make a profit for the producer, trader and state so I cannot see why it would be impossible to do with pot. You would have to have licensing to sell the stuff, just like booze, and it would be subject to the same age restrictions and fines. Maybe even restrict the sale to off-licences instead of any shop which currently sells booze.

They difference between Chicago in the 1920's is how the illicit substances are being manufactured. While done underground and illegally in the US, it still wasn't being produced by slave labour. 

For example, say it was legalised and I set up a proper cannabis farm, producing bales of the stuff and staffed by cheap eastern-European labour. How do I compete in price against people who don't pay their workers anything, who are further subsidised by the money they make bringing these people into the country? Economies of scale only factor so far.

Why do people buy cheap, crappy DVD's from street sellers when they could get legitimately produced and high-quality products from the supermarket? Its obvious.

And introducing legal weed is only going to make it harder to regulate the illicitly produced stuff, not easier, because there are so many ways it can be snuck into the legit supply chain.

Really, the Doctor is a rule breaker just by virtue of trying to help people out. His people were mostly hands off except when they broke their own rules, and even then they usually got the doctor to do their dirty work.  

The main ""timelord victorious"" thing was that he was messing around trying to save people who died during fixed points in time.  I think that if he thought it through a little more, he could have even saved everyone more or less without messing up a fixed point. About the only indication that everyone died is that history records that they did. Had the doctor removed them to another time, another planet out of contact with earth, or something else, they would have had to leave everything behind, but they would be alive while the historical records went unchanged.

I think it was also an interesting angle that perhaps he realized he could do more good in the fixed points. It was dangerous territory, but I think it could have actually been a positive change.

I've decided to cash in early (i.e. cheat a bit) and fill my fixture list with as many large games as I possibly can in order to get some much-needed income, as well as heavy pre-season training. So far, we've lost to Blackburn, Fulham and Liverpool (badly), but miraculously managed a draw against Hull, as well as a few wins against smaller teams.

**EDIT:** Second season and top of the Blue Square Premier. I signed some really old players from France and Italy as well as the prolific Nathan Blake and after a year of solid training and a year of almost putting the club out of business with my huge wages we've earned enough from friendlies against the best teams we could play and our parent side West Brom to sustain a fantastic team with fit, older players.

true,Hides-His-Eyes,null,null,"&gt;For instance, one highly popular activity among green-conscious folk both in the States and the UK is the recycling of glass bottles. The respondents in the survey actually considered that glass bottles require less energy to make than an aluminium can, which is totally wrong. Glass requires so much energy to make - or recycle - that it is always more eco-friendly to use aluminium cans, even if one is talking about virgin cans compared to recycled bottles.

A net energy loss is by no means a compelling reason not to use glass bottles or aluminium cans, if the alternative is a packaging that ends up in landfill.

&gt;something which many extremely keen lightswitch nazis refuse to do.

Do they indeed. [citation needed]

&gt;Another behaviour which people commonly consider to be energy-virtuous is the unplugging (or switching off at the wall) of appliances on standby or unused cell-phone chargers. This is an even bigger waste of time than switching off lights: a modern TV on standby uses less than a watt of power. You would need to unplug it or switch it off for a year to save as much energy as it takes to have one-and-a-half baths.

The argument *against* doing this is..?

Yes, it's important to educate people about the most effective way to save energy. No, being a selfish prick who never recycles and leaves the lights on all the time does not give you the right to feel smug over someone making a genuine effort just because they're not completely aware of which aspects of their efforts are most effective.",0,1282142109,null,0,true,0,c0x3eqo,t3_d2krt,t1_c0x3eqo,t3_d2krt,null,1426427529,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

Fact: Every day, as a species, we use more energy than we did the day before.

Think about this. Did you use more energy today than the day before? No? Then someone else is. Industry, transportation, not consumers!

I want to throttle every single ""eco-friendly"" member of my family that is so anal about turning off devices on standby etc sometimes. There's only so many times I can hear ""every little helps"". NO! It fucking does not! If every single person in the world saved 5% on their electricity usage by turning off devices on standby (and that is a fucking generous estimation) then the world, as a whole, would save a MAXIMUM of 5% (and again, the real figure would be much lower) which is **not enough!**.

Then these people sit back smugly satisfied that they have done their part and no further action is required. Bollocks. Everyone says ""well it's not harmful to save a little for the wrong reasons"", it *is* if you believe you are doing enough and you are not. Complacency is dangerous whether you are a complacent person doing nothing, or a complacent person not doing enough.

We need big, big changes and to be honest there's very little that a consumer can do on a personal level.

This goes completely against all logic. The report offers no mechanism to explain this. Nor is ""more toxic"" quantified. I checked the report [here](http://www.fph.org.uk/uploads/Healthy%20nudges%20-%20final%20final.pdf), there is nothing to validate the claim. Here's the full quote:

&gt; There are strong scientific reasons why it is important to regulate smoking in cars. In a closed car, levels of second-hand smoke can be extremely high – the concentration in cars can be up to 60 times higher than in a smoke-free home, and up to 27 times greater than in a smoker’s home.

Note that the rest of the publication provides citations, even for throwaway statelments like ""Britain now has one of the best road safety records in the world"". This toxicity claim doesn't even mention who it was that first made it, let alone cite the method.

Calling this bullshit science is an insult to both science and bullshit, it's no better than the anti-vaccination shite everyone fell for. And once again, history repeats itself, harming kids in an attempt to help them. 

edit: I think I've worked it out. They took a cigarette and pumped air through it into a sealed car then measured the smoke density.

You can check the list at the [UCAS](http://clearing.ucas.com/cgi-bin/hsrun/clv02/cl_search10/cl_search.hjx;start=cl_search.Hspresearch.run) website. If he's thinking about this get on the phone quick!

2. Did he check his track? He might have gotten into his insurance or got a replacement offer (e.g. we can't take you for the course you applied but we'll take you for biology instead). If he didn't get in on either choice, that's the time to check the marks

4. Pretty much :D Just be aware that you have to plan what you are doing around the exams (I had to be in the UK in November and June to take mine)

5. I think he means doing a year 14. Yes you can do that but I wouldn't recommend it. It's generally viewed as the 'herp derp derp' option. He can just pay a fee to sit the exams on the next round they are on. That's what I did and I didn't go to school or class, I just revised from the material that I already had.

6 and 7 I was super down too and thought everything would go wrong from here. I was upset but then just kicked myself on the ass and got down to it. That's what he'll have to do, since most open days are probably filled. I can't stress enough how good it is to speak to a member of the faculty and get on their good side. If you're recommended by a teacher you'll probably get a lowered offer

Not as straight forward as that. The 109 was fuel injected so could operate when the acceleration of the plane towards the ground was greater than the rate of gravity. The Spitfire and Hurricane had traditional engines with a carburettor. Some manoeuvres would cause the fuel to stop flowing and would stall the plane. Otherwise the Spitfire was more agile.

The other issue is the guns. Yes the Germans used cannons but the 109 had 2 cannons. The British planes used 8 linked machine guns. The cannons had an advantage but not as big as it would have been.

David Mitchell appears as a team captain in an average one called **Would I Lie to You?**, hosts a half-decent one called **The Bubble** and hosts an excellent radio 4 one called **The Unbelievable Truth**. 


**Mock the Week** is okay, usually has a few decent comedians on showcasing their material, often from across the pond. **Have I Got News for You** and **Never Mind the Buzzcocks** are our ""staple"" panel shows, but are distinctly British and often topical, so may not suit.

If you like off-the wall humour, I highly recommend anything with Reeves and Mortimer. The new series of **Shooting Stars** has been very good. **The Mighty Boosh** is also quite popular, but a little 'zany' and hated by some.

Traditional sitcom fare: Definitely carry on with **Blackadder**. The first series is completely different to the other three. I would also say that **Father Ted** is far better than **Black Books**, **Red Dwarf** is pretty universally loved (apart from the later series), and **I'm Alan Partridge** is the traditional sitcom I rewatch the most.

I would say avoid sketch shows, we haven't put out anything amazing in the past few years. **That Mitchell and Webb Look** isn't bad, but their radio sketch series, **That Mitchell and Webb Sound** is much better.

Anyway as time went on he clearly got involved in trying to change events in the historicals (he tried to alter the outcome in The Crusade, for example, and The Myth Makers).  Obviously we have to acknowledge the writer's had their hands tied; their concept was that the Doctor was littler more than an old inventor from a very advanced future world -- not Earth, but still human -- and the historicals were supposed to be educational and you couldn't really change history in them.  There are mutliple ways to rationalize his behavior now, of course, and I think when you realize how much of a radical break it must have been for him to leave Gallifrey in the first place and reject the Time Lord society and culture, you can excuse him for being the way he was early on.  But that still doesn't make me like Hartnell any more; he is what he is.

If you look at the Hartnell stories, they are almost ALWAYS getting captured, and either forced to do things or are simply along for the ride while they try to escape (the historicals).  The TARDIS is almost always inaccessible -- under rubble, under water, in a force field, the lock is gone, the Doctor's key is gone, etc.  Because usually storywise, if they could get into that TARDIS and leave, they'd do so.

They're certainly written well and are much more readable than I was expecting, considering they were written between 70-100 years ago. You've got to be a little careful with Napier's as they were written at the time, and I think he used them to settle a few scores - he certainly made a few enemies from what he's written.

The USA PATRIOT Act provisions (for example) were supposed to sunset after December 31, 2005, and required a specific act of congress to re-authorise them... but because they were *already* on the books (no matter how temporarily), the default position in people's minds was to rubber-stamp them and turn them into permanent laws... which duly happened, to the impoverishment of the liberties of everyone concerned.

It's a question of the ""default position"" in people's minds, and the default position is usually whatever the current situation is.  If you can change the current situation to the one you want *even temporarily*, you have a massive advantage in the debate because in the absence of truly excellent arguments and a dedicatedly rational approach to an issue, people instinctively side with the status quo.

If substances are legal then the government has to make a case to make them illegal, arguing against their present legal status.  If these substances are quickly and easily declared illegal without debate, then the default position at the end of the 12 months is to *keep* them illegal, and anyone wishing to ensure the original (temporary!) intention is served then has to argue *why* they should be made legal... meaning they have to argue (and take action) in favour of legalising drugs.

This is easily spun into a ""soft on crime"" and ""pro-drug"" position by the media, and can easily become political suicide for any government who tried it... hence it's unlikely to happen (at least, in the UK) in practice.

Basically, ""temporarily"" declaring drugs illegal is just a sneaky way to criminalise them without debate or even good reason - debate is stifled at the time because the ban is officially ""only temporary"", and then debate is hamstrung (and a good reason is not required) after this period because the deck is pre-emptively stacked in favour of them remaining illegal.",0,1282310636,null,0,false,0,c0x9mar,t3_d3do0,t1_c0x9mar,t1_c0x9l52,null,1426430471,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"Here's the thing. The Civil Service has over a considerable period of time been getting more reliant on external parties to provide 'expertise' and 'delivery'. Consequently there isn't (and I'm not saying this is for all departments, but certainly the ones I've been involved with) a complete capability to deliver anything without private sector involvement. It may be IT, it could be law, it could be marketing, but somewhere along the line the departments I've worked with would not be able to function.

This dependency breeds a particular type of situation. Lets pick an imaginary department like DoSAC. DoSAC has a particular announcement made by a minister, and the policy drops out a new IT system. DoSAC does social affairs and citizenship, not IT. The people in charge, having been pushed into getting external 'sanity checks' and 'engaging the private sector' are unable to deliver the IT system without a healthy dose of independents, but doing things that way would mean that someone's at risk of getting bollocked if it goes wrong, so they go and establish a tender for the system and a consortium of thieves... erm... I mean IT service suppliers agree to collectively fuck over DoSAC for as much money as possible.

DoSAC being a simple shopper, uses a box ticking system and gets another third party to review the bids (thus removing responsibility for bad decision making) and lo and behold, the highest box tick scorer wins. Some of the companies involved have entire teams of people who's job is to watch the OJEU site for projects, to form bid teams and go for it just on the offchance (here's looking at you, Capita).

Here's the worst bit. In these situations if you remove the third parties, you're stuck with an environment in which people have grown accustomed to not delivering anything themselves (instead using contracts to get someone else to deliver), outsourcing or offloading responsibility where possible and avoiding decision making. The projects just aren't going to be done.

Gun crime figures don't relate to shootings either.  You will note that the Police in the UK don't carry firearms routinely because they don't need to, indeed that on average the Police in the UK end up killing about 3 people a year in response to firearms incidents.  The vast majority of firearms cases recorded involve weapons where no-one knows whether the weapon is real or not and that any crime where a firearm is discharged ends up on the national news with a massive police response.

yes i do assume its real as assumptions are the mother of all fuck ups.
would you really think its a fake if it was in front of you?

im pretty sure that anyone with brains adds shooting in to the gun crime stats would be false reporting other wise.

a threat with a gun or a replica is no different and should not be treated any differently. 

yes we have less armed officers but we do have armed officer or patrol 100% of the time mainly located in any potential terrorist risky location but that includes most large city's.

if there isnt that many then why are some of our forces looking to set up microphone system to pin point real gun shots in real time so they can locate the site better if it wasnt a pressing threat then they would be wasting money. http://www.gunshotlocating.com/files/Police_review_whole_article_including_front_page.pdf

if you changed gun legislation then their would be more guns........ WOW really thats a no brainer

you did miss the part about them being legally checked and reported firearms that they police know about.

i really duet that law abiding citizens with no criminal record that register with the police are suddenly going to turn in to armed robbers.

To the best of my knowledge (IANAGN), there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to comparatives.  For example, you could say that a colour is either red or not, making it an absolute categorisation.  But it's also perfectly acceptable to say, for example, that purple is more red than green.  It is universally understood to mean ""tends to be more like X"" even if X is something usually black and white, but not shades of grey (apologies for mixing my colours there).

So ""fairly unique"" may be wrong for some formal definition of mixing comparatives with absolutes, but the meaning is clear.  Every country is unique in its own way.  Some stand out more than others for different reasons.  I'm merely saying that of all the attributes that one might use to categorise how similar or different the United Kingdom is to other countries, our aristocracy is a feature which reduces the search space to a smaller result set (approaching uniqueness in the degenerative case of a single result) than other metrics.  However, I should like to stress that this is a casual opinion and not a view which is backed up by rigorous scientific data.

No, on second thoughts, I think ""fairly unique"" was the better choice :-)

Ultimately language is flexible.  Worrying about what is correct and what isn't is rather pointless.  So I shall now retire from this debate, good sirs, and have my lady wife fetch my pipe and slippers. Tally ho!

Yes, the new episodes are great for pacing but a lot of the classic feel is lost.  Back when they had 25 minute episodes you had 20+ episodes a season.  When they tried 45 minute episodes with Colin Baker, we had 13 episodes, but each story was at least a 2-parter.  Now we get a lot of single episodes.  Personally I don't expect the 45 minute format to change, but I would like to see ~20 episodes again.

Executive Producer Russell T Davies used ""Doctor Who"" when the series returned in 2005, but Tenth Doctor actor David Tennant asked to change it back to ""the Doctor"" beginning in 2006.

Scots law has been separate to English Law since the beginning of the Union three hundred years ago; where the hell does contemporary politics come in to it?

The real issue should be about if its still possible to make decisions of release on uncertain medical advice. Perhaps such decisions should even be made by a Judge rather then a politician to reduce the accusations of corruption?
