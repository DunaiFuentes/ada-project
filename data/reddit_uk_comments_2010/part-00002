The monopoly that the BT has is fucking awful, they're given such a thing without much opposition because they have the supposed responsibility of upgrading the network etc., they instead choose to up their prices and keep the bare essentials.

For example in my house we have the 20+ year old copper wiring. BT refuse to upgrade this on the ground of ""costs too much"". Now I'd feel some sympathy for them if they didn't charge more than twice as much as sky does. I pay 10 quid a month for unlimited broadband from Sky, BT wants 25. And to top this off, BT's routers are prone to breaking so I have to trudge through terrible (indian call centre) customer service and then wait a week just to get my internet back on. BT is a prime example of a Government service that should never have been privatised.

The Tories seem to want to correct this problem. Ideally I'd like to see where we do have private services that the companies holding the franchises are punished for poor behaviour in a stronger manner.

I've previously defended the railway privatisation because my service back in Wales has only gotten better since BR ended. However having recently moved to England and suffered under First Great Western I can see that a railway can be run to the point where it doesn't actually function before anything is done. This is unacceptable. Privatisation cannot work if companies are not punished for lack of performance. If they go out of the market as a result this is a good thing. We only want services that are run properly. If the companies that don't want to do this avoid the market then that is a good thing.

So my process would involve heavy regulation, fines for under performance and actual revocation of franchise in the long run if needed. Also I'd go for a public option. If nobody wants to run a rail service then the state can pick that one up. I'd also offer a public funded contractor for PFI projects.

true,lackofbrain,cnty-uk,Nowhere in particular,"My take on the video:

* Overall I thought it was pretty good, and very intersting. Nick Clegg comes across as down to earth and approachable, far more of a ""real person"" than Cameron or Brown. One feels one could have a civilised conversation with him over a coffee.
* The drugs question - very skillfully sidstepped and a slightly unneccesary side-swipe at the other two main parties. I agree with him but I think the attack was unnecessary. He knows what David Nutt said, and did not say what he would do with the advice he knows David Nutt would have given him. A definite minus point here
* The nuclear power question - I don't know if his facts are right, I haven't checked them, but he appeared to give a reasonable answer based on the facts as he sees them, with a minimum of spin. He didn't take the opportunity he could have done of changing his apparent position to suit his audience. He did not really address the underlying issue of the energy crunch, barring a few not very fleshed out ideas about renewables. This ommission could be simply a matter of time though - the video is only about sixteen minuites long.
* The tuition fees question - he gave a straight and fairly consice answer. I applaud him for that. 

At the end he asked what the top three things we as redditors think would get people voting. My answers:

1. Find a way to make politicians more representative of and answerable to their consituents. This is the big one. There is a lot of dissatisfaction with the current system, but no real idea of how to change it and a general apathy. People seem to feel that if there is nothing they can do to change things they may as well not pay attention to it. I feel the party system needs weakening, not strengthening, which is why I am opposed to any PR system which makes use of national party lists, and generally do not much like multi-MP constituencies.
2. Stop with the point scoring already! I don't give a flying donkey whether you scored a point at PMQs, I want the government to be run for the good of the country and its people, not the good of the ruling elite and their political party. As an aside - negative campaigning makes all politicians look bad, not just the ones you target with it. the Lib Dems are not as bad for this as Labour, but they do do it (see drugs question above)
3. Be human. Politicians are allowed to have flaws, and are allowed to make mistakes. Everyone does. But when you make mistakes, appologise, and do everything you can fix the problem, and then move on. As part of this, it is okay to change policies if arguments suggest you made a mistake originally. It really annoys me when opposition MPs call for the goverment to change its policies, then when they do they get lambasted by those same MPs for making a U-turn! This goes back to what I said above about point scoring!
4. Extra bonus idea: Scrap the party whip. No matter which party they are a member of an MPs first commitment is to his or her constituents, not to his party, and as such the whip is a push in exactly thwe wrong direction! back benchers voting against the goverment should not be a once a government phenomenon! 

Well, thats what I think, anyway!

I would also like to see Cameron and/or Brown do the same thing. I'm not sure they would dare! (Can I goad them into it by calling them cowards do you think?)

A further tip to Mr. Clegg: Good politicians court public opinion; great politicians change it.

Drugs policy is simply wrong. Liberal philosophy naturally fits the idea that the state has no business telling us what we can and can not put in to our own bodies. That is a natural right of man. It's right there in Jean Jacques Rousseau.

true,sanbikinoraion,null,null,"On (4), I really think that the party system is quite important for our democracy - and I can't think of another democracy that does *not* have political parties.

On one level, they are brand names; most voters do not have the time to consider all of the possible candidates in their area, but must rely on the brand of the party of each candidate. This is why I think Jury Team failed so spectacularly: in every area people had first parse through all the different Jury Team PPCs and vote for them in a primary, and then the entire electorate would have to familiarize themselves with the policies of every single Jury Team candidate.

As part of that, if you are elected under a brand name you have a responsibility to the brand *because* that is why a great deal of your constituents have voted for you in the first place. Whips simply exist to apply the party branding to the individuals. Yes, perhaps the influence of the whips is too great in that party leaders can make certain issues ""leadership issues"" that may not have been particularly important to the electorate. But I hope that we can eventually evolve a better quality of political party that curtails this power: the Lib Dems' internal democracy makes sure that the parliamentary party leaders are accountable to the rank and file, which is why Vince's mansion tax was clawed back by the federal policy committee: to punish him for speaking out of turn.

On another level, parties are very useful organizational structures. Independent MPs have to do an awful lot of research if they are to know everything about everything in order to make their best decision on it. But parties allow delegation of decision-making to committees of experts, so that, for instance, if you are IT-illiterate, you do not need to be involved in formulating IT-related policy, but you can vote in a particular direction on an issue knowing that people of a similar political stripe to you have already put the thought in. And of course for issues close to your heart, you have the ability to both influence party policy and to vote against the party line if you so wish.

What I think *is* problematic in our current party system is the notion that a single party controls government at any one time. This puts *enormous* pressure on government MPs to vote the party line because any defeat reflects on the party (and hence country's) leadership.

They are - as much anyone can be 'right' on such a massively complex and far-reaching subject. See http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/avk1j/ask_nick_clegg_anything_reddit_video_interview/c0jmugf

&gt; ...a few not very fleshed out ideas about renewables.

Again, a hugely complex problem that has no absolute answer - but a great deal of independent analysis shows that his view is the right one. Aggressive efficiency drives (we all save money on fuel bills!) and a broad range of renewable energy sources. Whichever route we take is going to be challenging and expensive - but the nuclear route will be the most expensive and the least successful with regards climate change mitigation and rapid energy production.

Also, there is the social issue with going down the renewable route rather than the nuclear one. If we all invest in renewables the technology improves and reduces in cost - that benefits everyone on the planet. Nuclear will *never* be cheap enough for poor, developing countries to afford. Everyone can afford a few solar panels. Everyone community can afford a wind turbine.

&gt; The drugs question - very skillfully sidstepped and a slightly unneccesary side-swipe at the other two main parties.

Not at all. He gave the perfect answer IMO. Science should decide and inform our drugs policy - *every* policy. If marijuana is less damaging than alcohol then there is no reason for it to be illegal. That's what he's saying - see http://act.libdems.org.uk/group/liberaldemocratsfordrugpolicyreform/forum/topics/current-liberal-democrat-drug?xg_source=activity

I think if the benefit to London (or any other area) out weighs the detriment to other areas then that is acceptable because the county as a whole benefits.  (Im not saying that actually will be the case for the Olympics though)

I dont think any government action has ever helped the entire UK if that means helping every single individual or area because that’s just not possible.

I also think that is it ok for a government to take from one area to give to another as long as the result is an overall gain (I think that is meant to be the plan for the Olympics).  And I think that is a vital part of any union:  occasionally some part of it has to take one for the team.

As for the lies used to promote the Olympics, Im only 25 but as far as I can see politics works by telling obvious lies (“the Olympics will benefit everyone”, “Iraq has WMDs” and soon “regime change in Iran will be good for everyone”).  No one really believes these (ok, maybe a few very stupid people do…) but they provide an excuse for people to vote for whatever the hell they like without worrying about their conscience or better judgement.  Sort of in the same way that alcohol does not change who you are, it just stops you from ignoring your more stupid impulses.  As such I never believe what politicians say and I expect the worse when others do.  Maybe Im too much of a cynic…

The long and short of this (**TL;DR**) is that we are stuck with the Olympics, Everyone is going to pay, and the best way to cut the cost to everyone (and maybe even run the thing at a net gain for the county, even if that is only seen London) is to abandon any lip service towards “fairness” and get the most work for the least money.

It seems like a lot of the stuff BlueRock kindly put up has a low return on investment - certainly this appears to be the case with solar for me.

&gt; Ground source heat pumps provide a new and clean way of heating buildings ... They make use of **renewable energy** stored in the ground, providing one of the most energy-efficient ways of heating buildings.  The only energy used by Ground Source Heat Pump systems is **electricity to power the pumps.**  Typically, a Ground Source Heat Pump will deliver 3 or 4 times as much thermal energy (heat) as is used in electrical energy to drive the system.

Basically, kids in Europe learn how to form sentences out of their component parts, and put those parts together into the proper structure. Once it comes to learning English, all they need to do is to learn some new words, and the way the construction methods differ between the two languages.

British kids, right, like, don't learn stuff like that, like adverbs and verbs and that. It's all, like, what they know, yeah? And once they know it, they teachers, right, like, they let them do whatever they want with it. And the teachers understand the kids, yeah, and the kids understand the teachers, so there's no problem. But, like, there's actually a problem, because the kids don't know why they do. And that's bad, yeah?

My condolences to the families of any grammar nazis killed by the previous paragraph.

My point is, that without a proper grounding in how a language is supposed to work (which European children receive and which British children do not), then learning a second language is impossible. For at least thirty years, probably longer, British schools have been failing to teach children how the English language works. Because of this, such teaching needs to be provided during the learning of the second language, but since British children do not learn these lessons with the benefit of a proper grounding in English, the information they get from them has no context.

I think you are right in that this may be the problem, but it takes a lot more to learn another language than just learning the words and putting them in the right order.

Spanish for example, has a much greater focus on verb suffixes in order to convey subjects. For me this was very hard to grasp at first, it took a good couple of months of (admittedly irregular) reading and speaking to properly take hold of this concept.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"*sigh*. Taxing banking transactions will have one of two effects:

a) Reducing the number of transactions (depending upon how transaction is defined) and increase price volatility, widen bid-ask spreads for end users such as investors, savers and hedgers, and destroy liquidity.

b) Unless this is implemented worldwide across the banking system, banks will move their transactional components to safe havens.

Little footnote for b: It's not possible to implement this around the world as there are quite a few places where they would not implement it (think Cayman, Switzerland but also Islamic states).

It seems like a variant of the Tobin tax with a socialist administrative element. Who would be in charge of redistributing all the wealth that won't suddenly appear as banks flee to safe havens? What will happen to all that cash that bankers would've spent? What would happen to all the banking jobs for those that stay behind? Cashier's desk at Northern Rock perhaps?

I oppose the idea for 3 reasons:

1) It's economically unsound.
2) Tax should be used to shore up the economy, not for redistributing wealther based on political causes - case in point, we're all poor at the moment!
3) In a sound economy there is no need for taxation on the scale the UK currently has. We pay ludicrous volumes of tax as it is, the country does not need nor want any more tax.

&gt;  for me ""any transaction not involving a member of the public"" is good enough.

Ok - but what about transactions done on behalf of a member of the public? E.g. your pension. The interest gained on your deposit account comes from the bank lending out your money. Should they pay this tax on that transaction, since if so then it'll get passed straight on to you.

Charities have massive investments in equities, FX, mutual funds etc. I assume you'd be making them exempt from this. Universities have endowments in similar areas (exempt?).

Things then start to get complex when an institution uses another insitution to perform a specialist transaction, for example the transfer of beneficial ownership done in securities lending in the dividend season. Do you tax every stage of the transaction chain (potentially racking up large charges) or just once (potentially requiring a massive monitoring infrastructure to keep track of what has already been paid).

It's nice that the people involved in this want to get more money to help people, but they are naive in thinking a Tobin Tax would work.

Lets say you buy £1000 of shares and sell them for £1500. That's a tax of 00.5% on £2500 worth of share dealing which is £1.25.

&gt; Exchange money (Not a speculative transaction so you don't pay Robin hood tax on it)
&gt; Buy Stock (pay 0.05% tax)

I had another look at the site, where it names the numbers. 
http://robinhoodtax.org.uk/how-it-works/the-big-idea/

The money exchange is taxed at 0.005% and the stock transaction is taxed at 0.5%. So, re-working that example you'd have:

    (1000 x 0.005% = 0.05) + (999.95 x 0.5% = 4.99) = 5.04 outbound
    (1500 x 0.5% = 7.50) + (1492.50 x 0.005%) = 0.75) = 8.25 inbound

So, you pay 13.29 in this tax. Now, you've assumed that is coming out of a 500 pound profit - a 50% rate of return. That's pretty high, a 5% rate of return is more realistic (but if you can do 50% [ROCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROCE) then I'd love to talk to you about investing my money!). 

You also need to factor inflation (currently just below 3%) to give a ""real"" value of a gain of 2% since your capital is eroded by inflation during its deployment.

So, taking the numbers of 100 transactions of 1000 each earning 5% and depreciating the entire set by 3% (inflation) you end up paying:

    Outbound 100 x 1000 FX @ 0.005% = £5.00
    Outbound 100 x 1000 Stock @ 0.5% = £500
    Our stock goes up by 5% so it's now worth 1050
    Inbound 100 x 1050 Stock @ 0.5% = £525
    Inbound 100 x 1050 FX @ 0.005% = £5.25

Profit before tax: Capital of 1000 x 5% profit * 100 times = 5000 minus starting capital = 4000. 
Profit after tax = 4000 - 1035.25 = 2964.75

You've now paid 25.8% of extra tax on your profits.

true,Gusfoo,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; But surely most Banks Money is really someone elses?

Absolutely not! A retail bank, if it were purely retail and did no other activities at all would fit that definition, but you'd be back in the old Building Societies or 1980s-era banks to find a real example. A lot (most?) of what the banks are using for capital they have either made as profit themselves or have borrowed on the inter-bank market as short-term working capital.

(For info, it was the drying-up of the inter-bank lending market that was the prime reason for the ECB and Fed making vast amounts of money available for the banks to borrow. The desire was that they borrowed it and started to lend again.) 

Personal deposits *are* a source of finance, and for most banks they are in great desire because they're one of the cheapest forms of borrowing, but in no way would one say that all the money the banks are investing belongs to someone-else.

&gt; Surely if they didnt have it someone else would? 

I'm not sure what you're saying there. A bank could sell off all of it's assets (stocks, bonds, derivative contracts etc.), take the profits and give them to the share-holders and shut down, yeah. I don't think that's what you mean though.


&gt; Arent they basically just a tax on the world?

I'm aware that I'm coming over like a Banking Fan-boy here but no - I don't think that that is true. A simple example is that the banks give out mortgages and, by doing so, make a profit. That's a legitimate area of business that I'm sure you'd support. There is also the whole edifice of consumer credit (credit cards and loans) and retail banking (APACS, direct debits, debit cards). Retail-level loans get packed into Collateralised Debt Obligations (CDOs) in a process called securitisation and sold to large investors like banks, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds etc. Banks also do things like underwriting IPOs.

(For info, the CDOs mentioned above were one of the prime causes of the current crisis. The mortgages they comprised were of much lower quality [sub-prime] than they were advertised as. The idea was that not all the mortgages in a CDO [technically a [RMBS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residential_mortgage-backed_security)] would default at the same time, so the CDOs were sold in tranches. The top tranche would only get defaults hitting it if all of the rest had been hit. This gave the illusion of AAA-rated debt being manufactured from shitty debt. A grave mistake)

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ok, so firstly, its important to know exactly what indigenous means, wikipedia - 
&gt;""Indigenous peoples are any ethnic group who inhabit a geographic region with which they have the earliest known historical connection.""

**The first part of your question**, yes there are indigenous people in Australia, without going into too much detail, they have inhabited Australia for up to [125,000 years](http://media.uow.edu.au/news/2004/0917a/index.html).

You say Amazonians, I don't know much about the tribes in the amazon, but, I am not aware of any battles for territory, which is essentially what kills off indigenous people, so yes, I imagine the tribes in the Amazon are the indigenous Amazonians.

**The second part of your question: why there are no indigenous britons?** To simplify things we can just start off with the The Bronze Age at about 2200BC, say that the people who built stone henge were indigenous (they were similar to everyone else in Europe), now I will list the other societies who have lived (and shagged the indigenous people) in the UK, either by invasion or just by sneaking in,

* 500BC Celts
* 50BC Gauls
* 55BC Romans
* 5AD Scots (originally from North East Ireland)
* 5AD Angles
* 5AD Saxons
* 5AD Jutes (there may have been more than this, the fall of the roman empire is not well documented)
* 789AD Vikings (England ruled by the danish from 1016)
* 1066AD Normans
* And then in about 1650 you get indian people, (first indian restaurant in london in 1810)
* Around 1750 you get black people because of the slave trade.

So basically, if you're going to draw the indigenous line before indians, why not draw it before normans, or before Vikings? No one has a clue what ethnicity they are, or how long their blood line has been in the UK. The UK has seen more immigration over its history than almost any other country in the world, there might, somewhere, be the odd indigenous person who has some how slipped through, but its highly unlikely, and they certainly won't know it.

&gt;""Indigenous peoples are any ethnic group who inhabit a geographic region with which they have the earliest known historical connection.""

true,square_cubed,null,null,"That list looks rather fishy. The Gauls and Scots were Celts and the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Vikings and Normans were all Germanic tribes. That reduces your list, pre-1650, to the migration of three distinct peoples.

If we're going to go by a definiton, I would prefer a more reputable and concrete one than that of Wikipedia, seeing as how anyone can put anything they want to on there.

[Oxford English dictionary](http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/indigenous?view=uk) defines indigenous as:
&gt;originating or occurring naturally in a particular place; native. 

[Cambridge online dictionary](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=40261&amp;dict=CALD&amp;topic=race-and-ethnicity) as:
&gt;naturally existing in a place or country rather than arriving from another place

Now, take an English, Scottish or Welsh person at random. Where is that person naturally existing, where are they native to, where are they indigenous to? The only identifiable places are England, Scotland or Wales - Britain. They are an indigenous Briton.

Take an Indian living in Britain - where is that person naturally existing, where are they native to, where are they indigenous to? By your very calling them ""Indian"", you are acknowledging that they are not one of the indigenous people of Britain - but rather one of the indigenous people of India.

&gt;So basically, if you're going to draw the indigenous line before indians, why not draw it before normans, or before Vikings?

The answer here is that the Normans and Vikings have culturally and genetically (phenotypically) assimilated with the indigenous, whom they are indistinguishable from. On the other hand, the Indians haven't - they retain their identity with and connection to India and are easily distinguishable from the indigenous Briton population.

All countries outside of sub-saharan africa have 100% immigrant populations.

I think there is an indigenous population of western Europe, that is what I am, but obviously that would include the polish, so doesn't fit into the BNP's plans.

Anyway, the conversation we're having here is far more of a debate than the BNP have ever had on what indigenous actually means, on Question Time Nick Griffin said that it was the people who have been living here for the last 17,000 years, which means that no one would count as Britain was covered by ice until about 12,000, so he's clearly just thought indigenous = white (that'll fool them). 

Also:
&gt;All countries outside of sub-saharan africa have 100% immigrant populations.

Is a silly comment, you can only immigrate if there is a country to immigrate into, otherwise you're just a settler, like the Aborigines, i.e. the indigenous people.

In respect of that, a player actually backing this will only bring the problem to his own front door. It's not that they're scared, it's just that it's a bit of a no-brainer really.

*From The Independent*:

**The BNP's Sikh supporter: Rajinder Singh**

After the BNP voted to allow non-whites to join the party yesterday, the first to sign up is likely to be Rajinder Singh, a 78-year-old Sikh. Mr Singh, a retired teacher, has been sympathetic towards the BNP since hearing Nick Griffin on television in 2001. He has since written for the party's newspaper, Freedom, appeared on its internet TV channel, BNPTV, and voted for them.

In 2005 he provided a character reference for Mr Griffin at his trial for inciting racial hatred. Mr Singh came to the UK from India in 1967. He blames Muslims for the death of his father during the Partition of India in 1947. He said: ""I got in touch with the BNP on certain core policies that appeal to me. I also admire them since they are on their own patch, and do not wish to let anyone else oust them from the land of their ancestors.""

Martin Wingfield, the BNP's communications and campaigns officer, has recently told members: ""I say adapt and survive and give the brave and loyal Rajinder Singh the honour of becoming the first ethnic minority member of the BNP.""",0,1266253248,null,0,false,0,c0klk4b,t3_b2bul,t1_c0klk4b,t3_b2bul,null,1426215296,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Are the Tories implying they will fix this? If they actually intend to carry out the policies they profess I can only see the class divide deepening.

Dear Cretins,

I have been an NTL customer since 9th July 2001, when I signed up for
your 3-in-one deal for cable TV, cable modem, and telephone. During this
three-month period I have encountered inadequacy of service which I had
not previously considered possible, as well as ignorance and stupidity
of monolithic proportions. Please allow me to provide specific details,
so that you can either pursue your professional perogative, and seek to
rectify these difficulties - or more likely (I suspect) so that you can
have some entertaining reading material as you while away the working
day smoking B&amp;H and drinking vendor-coffee on the bog in your office:
My initial installation was cancelled without warning, resulting in my
spending an entire Saturday sitting on my fat arse waiting for your
technician to arrive. When he did not arrive, I spent a further 57
minutes listening to your infuriating hold music, and the even more
annoying Scottish robot woman telling me to look at your helpful
website....HOW?

I alleviated the boredom by playing with my testicles for a few minutes
- an activity at which you are no-doubt both familiar and highly adept.
The rescheduled installation then took place some two weeks later,
although the technician did forget to bring a number of vital tools -
such as a drill-bit, and his cerebrum. Two weeks later, my cable modem
had still not arrived. After 15 telephone calls over 4 weeks my modem
arrived... six weeks after I had requested it, and begun to pay for it.
I estimate your internet server's downtime is roughly 35%... hours
between about 6pm -midnight, Mon-Fri, and most of the weekend. I am
still waiting for my telephone connection. I have made 9 calls on my
mobile to your no-help line, and have been unhelpfully transferred to a
variety of disinterested individuals, who are it seems also highly
skilled bollock jugglers.

I have been informed that a telephone line is available (and someone
will call me back); that no telephone line is available (and someone
will call me back); that I will be transferred to someone who knows
whether or not a telephone line is available (and then been cut off);
that I will be transferred to someone (and then been redirected to an
answer machine informing me that your office is closed); that I will be
transferred to someone and then been redirected to the irritating
Scottish robot woman...and several other variations on this theme.
Doubtless you are no longer reading this letter, as you have at least a
thousand other dissatisfied customers to ignore, and also another one of
those crucially important testicle-moments to attend to. Frankly I don't
care, it's far more satisfying as a customer to voice my frustration's
in print than to shout them at your unending hold music. Forgive me,
therefore, if I continue.

I thought BT were shit, that they had attained the holy piss-pot of godawful
customer relations, that no-one, anywhere, ever, could be more
disinterested, less helpful or more obstructive to delivering service to
their customers. That's why I chose NTL, and because, well, there isn't
anyone else is there? How surprised I therefore was, when I discovered
to my considerable dissatisfaction and disappointment what a useless
shower of bastards you truly are. You are sputum-filled pieces of
distended rectum incompetents of the highest order.
British Telecom - wankers though they are - shine like brilliant beacons
of success, in the filthy puss-filled mire of your seemingly limitless
inadequacy. Suffice to say that I have now given up on my futile and
foolhardy quest to receive any kind of service from you. I suggest that
you cease any potential future attempts to extort payment from me for
the services which you have so pointedly and catastrophically failed to
deliver - any such activity will be greeted initially with hilarity and
disbelief quickly be replaced by derision, and even perhaps bemused
rage. I enclose two small deposits, selected with great care from my
cats litter tray, as an expression of my utter and complete contempt for
both you and your pointless company. I sincerely hope that they have not
become desiccated during transit - they were satisfyingly moist at the
time of posting, and I would feel considerable disappointment if you did
not experience both their rich aroma and delicate texture. Consider them
the very embodiment of my feelings towards NTL, and its worthless
employees.

Have a nice day - may it be the last in you miserable short life, you
irritatingly incompetent and infuriatingly unhelpful bunch of twats.
