* Instead of editing it to make it clearer it was a joke, or noting so in a reply (or indeed, accepting any responsibility whatsoever for your inexpressiveness), you accused me of being a heartless cunt with no sense of humour.  And *worse*, you accused me of being Tory.

* I pointed out that just because I criticised you for expressing yourself poorly and making unsubstantiated claims (or just failing to make an unambiguous joke), that doesn't mean that I approve of the Tories.

* I also parodied your party-political partisanship and jumping to baseless conclusions by pretending in turn to assume you were part of a hypothetical Labour Propaganda Department, so demonstrate the ridiculousness of jumping to unsupported assumptions, or letting party-political partisanship cloud your judgement.

TL;DR: Next time you make a joke, please either add qualifiers in to demonstrate you're not actually making a claim of fact, or indicate the fact you aren't serious in some other way (post-script, &lt;/joke&gt;, emoticon, etc).

Facial expression and tone of voice are lost when reading text, so it's easy for a harmless or even amusing joke to look like a serious (and baseless/misleading) claim, which may mislead other people.  Not everyone on the internet is as smart as you, or aware of the context in which you made/posted every statement.

Still TL;DR: Peeples stoopid.  Text make stoopider.  Asking future be careful regarding tone, or peeples mistake for seerius, and then bad potential happen. ;-)",0,1275406707,null,0,false,0,c0r6rfa,t3_ca6ca,t1_c0r6rfa,t1_c0r6qq3,null,1426327345,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

I *kinda* recommend them, in that I find cable internet to be far more reliable than ADSL. But, although the technology used to deliver it is more reliable, they're not a particularly brilliant ISP. If you phone them up for support, you just get flowchart-monkeys who won't talk to you until you've rebooted\* everything twenty times, and lock up in fear if you're using something that isn't Windows, or their own router. Their hardware is reasonably reliable, and they don't have too many network problems (I monitor my connection, I have around one outage a week, ranging from a couple of minutes to an hour, usually late at night. Once in the last year I had a significant outage of a few hours, but apart from that I'd rarely notice if I wasn't monitoring it).

However, they do (uncapped) 50Mbit connections (which, as far as I'm aware, none of the ADSL suppliers can do). You definitely pay for it but, fuck me, it's quick. (I'm downloading right now at 5.6MB/sec. That's roughly a 5gb file in 15 minutes). Their other speeds are capped (although they're relatively humane, they just drop your download speed to 500k/s-ish for a few hours if you go over. Not the end of the world).

IPs aren't strictly static, but they don't change very often at all (I've had mine for about a year, the one before for ~18 months).

I previously used Be, who are excellent and I would definitely recommend them if you have no option to get cable.

20mbit is standard, with an option of 50 (and you actually get 20mbit on cable, rather than between-5-and-8-unless-you-live-next-door-to-an-exchange), so if you can get cable, and you want the speed, and you're happy to accept you're not going to get any help at all from their tech support apart from ""reboot"" and the ability to report a fault (which they'll ignore until all your neighbours do too)... Then I recommend them.

Otherwise, I'd say go for Be.

But you should be pretty damn cautious no matter what ISP you're using. If you:

 * Avoid The Pirate Bay and other free torrent sites (finding a [private tracker](http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers) is probably the best thing you can do)
 * Avoid downloading very very new stuff that's still in the cinema (often identifiable as they'll be marked as TS, Telesync, Screener, etc - the quality is often shit anyway) - these are the things the media companies tend to go after the hardest.
 * Avoid stuff that someone managed to get a retail rip before the release date. Harder to identify, I'll admit.

If you do that, then you're unlikely to have any significant problems.

If you can, SSL encryption is an excellent idea (not always easy, depends what you're doing), as that'll prevent them from even seeing what you're downloading.

I'm sticking with the theory that the opening of the Pandorica and the resolution of the crack involves River Song closing the crack by using the Doctor and (in?) the TARDIS. The failsafe could be young Amelia, armed with River's diary, to ""remember"" the Doctor back into being. This would allow River to kill ""the best man she ever knew"" AND for the Doctor to still exist. More importantly, it allows for a Star Trek-style ""it's all reset but it's not"" reimagining of Doctor Who continuity. Any discontinuity can be blamed on Amy's information being lacking.

If River does ""kill"" the Doctor at the Pandorica and this is not her FIRST meeting with him, she knows the Doctor will survive it and will gladly take the rap. After all, she has already met him in his future.

The company is run by a guy, [Keith Chorlton,](http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/investigations/33keith.jpg) banned from trading (although he has an office and runs the company from their every day), putting it in his wife's name, then in his annoying brattish son's names. He drives to work in Aston Martins and shows off his new cars to all workers, putting pictures of them on the big screens in the call centre. Last one he bought was a private plane/jet and we had to stare at it all day while dealing with irate customers trying to get their money back to pay rent.

The place is a fucking joke.. every aspect of it. I sincirely hope the law changes so that he gets locked up and other companies that are the same (although finding one as bad will be impossible IMO) are outlawed.

It isn't going to stop people from killing each other, it wouldn't make him a productive member of society. All it is, is a punishment. A life long punishment. A capital spanking.

Do I think they should just let murderers free after commiting their first offence? Don't be ridiculous. The sentence instead of jail for a thief should be to pass an exam. The sentence for a drug addict should be rehab. The sentence for a murderer? Well that's a tricky one.

Dalek: 1) I started with a black tank top as a base, mine was stretchy but that turned out to be such a pain in the ass later, so I'd recommend no stretch on the tank top if possible.

2)I then used a practice skirt that I made for a costuming class as a sort of pattern for the gold skirt. I tried to approximate what modifications I would need (ie. shorter, more flair) as I cut out the skirt.

3) Then I sewed the skirt on to the tank top at the waist and cut off the  excess tank material and put a zipper in the back.

These first three steps were the majority of making the dress

4)I made a sash out of the same gold material as the dress (to go around my waist) and hemmed both sides of that and sewed some large snaps so it could attach around my waist and hide where the shirt met skirt.

5)Then I did the panels of Dalekanium, I cut out 7 panels from poster board, just regular old poster board, and spray painted them with a metallic bronze spray paint on BOTH sides (if you want me to I can find out specifically which spray paints I used...but I just guessed which one would look good, so there is probably better ones out there)

6. Hemispheres- Spray painted the bottom halves of easter eggs gold. And then tackey glued them to the prettiest side of the poster board dalekanium panels.

7. Back to the sash, I spray painted gold (with fabric spray paint) little rectangles of the gold fabric and linned them with goldish ribbon that matched the color of the fabric and glued them on the sash to replicate that middle section of Dalek. Then I glued the panels on to the sash.

8. Details- I put ribbon around the top portion of the shirt, glued to the shirt while it was on to me (told you I hated the stretchy tank top). I also put black ribbon on the bottom of the skirt. I am just wearing like a square dancing petticoat under the dress for the poof. And the head band was hot glued together with two little nalgene bottles I got at REI. I also did little things like adding screws to make it look more Dalek

3) This dress invovled a lot of printing on Fabric Paper, you can get it at any crafts store in the T-Shirt making isle, and we printed out a poster of the inside of the TARDIS, and all the signs.

4. The windows were made out of black ribon and the glass was yellow sheer fabric with white fabric behind it.

5. The doors were held closed by magnets.

But these usually involve business relationships and relate to independent expertise, avoiding legal costs etc. Sharia courts are sectarian and deal with matters outside of the public sphere such as  divorce, child custody, domestic violence.  Our civil courts are in the position of upholding decisions made by religious courts. I think it is understandable that people fear it may conflict with secular values and undermine social cohesion. Islam, unlike Judaism (which also uses religious arbitration), is a fast growing religion in the UK.

I accept your argument though. I wouldn't want a French style civil society banning burkas and whatnot. But the subject should at least be debated sensibly, if only to bring out the arguments in public and undermine the extreme right.

*Pretty decent story. Could have functioned as just an episode, but it was told well in game form at least.

*Was fun enough to burn some time on.

**BAD:**

*As a game, it was like something from the early 2000's. The controls weren't good at all, and were my biggest problem with it. 9/10 it was using the mouse-as-a-camera that was the problem; at times it's not responsive enough, and at others it's much too sensitive. The sensitivity settings only helped a little.

*Too much sneaking around. I get that was the point of this 'episode', but it was super annoying. It was all timing based, so you could just count, run, count, run, etc.

*The sensitivity focused puzzles; they were horrible. If it had handled better, maybe even supported a game controller, it might have been different. and it was just variations of the same puzzle. Not very creative. It was more just filler than anything.

*Doesn't support game controllers.

The law has now changed so that only 16 tablets can be sold at a time and they must be in blister packs, so to kill yourself you need to visit several shops and pop out X pills.

true,buildmonkey,eu,Fake Yorkshireman,"Such a bullshit article. I am glad they at least opened it by referring to 'fictional skivers', because most of the rest of it has little grasp on reality.

&gt;Only nine per cent qualified for lifelong maximum ESA support.

Well that is good, because there is no such thing as 'lifelong maximum ESA support"". All claims are regularly reassessed. Actually all claims for Incapacity Benefit are regularly reassessed, as were all claims Invalidity Benefit before it. OK, I will allow a rider on that. Some people will get lifelong maximum ESA without reassessment. That is because you should be passported if you are terminally ill and you are likely to be dead before your reassessment comes round. The problem is that the privatised medical assessment (Atos Healthcare) is so shit that it has regularly been failing to spot terminal illness and thrown dying people *off* ESA. 

Oh yeah, and did you hear the one about the DWP worker who was fired as unfit for work based on a report by Atos Healthcare who was then refused ESA based on a report by Atos Healthcare?

&gt;According to figures from the Department for Work and Pensions, initial assessments found two-thirds of new ESA claimants were capable of some kind of work, including those who left the system before tests were complete.

This is because they brought in new stringent tests that many disability groups and advice agencies told them were not workable in practice and would hit people with mental heath problems in particular. The DWP were expecting something like 50% to be chucked off and are now getting about two-thirds. What the article does not say is that 40% of those decisions that get to appeal are reversed. What it also does not say is that DWP staff working in Jobcentres are reporting that they are having to deal with increasing numbers of JSA claimants who are not fit for any sort of work but who have been refused ESA. This puts them in a difficult position because they have to agree that the person is available for work before they can process their JSA claim when they know that they are not because they are unfit for work.

&gt;including those who left the system before tests were complete

Claims are stopped if someone fails to attend medicals or interviews. This includes people with mental health problems that cannot attend or with learning disabilites that did not understand that they had to attend. So a percentage of this wastage are claimants with real problems that are now shut out by bureaucracy.

&gt;If the same results applied to the 2.6 million people currently on incapacity benefit, 1.8million would be able to do some work, including 860,000 who would be fully fit. But the DWP said it did not expect the total figure to be as high because many claimants are likely to have been out of work with long-term health problems.

The headline says 2 million. Not 1.8 million. Wrong by 200,000 people. Hang on though. The DWP say that they don't expect it to be as high as 1.8 million. So not even that bit is correct. The headline is a deliberate lie.

We have now had Doctor Who platform games, top trumps games and a 'stealth adventure.'

Why, for the love of all that is holy, has no one yet designed a Doctor Who game in the one and only genre that completely fits the show? I refer to, of course, the point-and-click adventure game genre. I mean, seriously. License the Telltale games engine (which was quite cheap last I looked) and give us a proper story with multiple interactions with items, and actual incidental detail. 

Instead we get the most linear game I have ever played where you don't even get to figure out what to do, because the Doctor or Amy tell you. It's a scavenger hunt with minigames.

I have heard two reasons why the game is like it is - the first is that they didn't have much time to make these games, which is fair enough and something they should learn from. The second excuse is that these games are designed so kids between 7 and 11 can play them and get through the whole story. Well, when I was 8, I played goddamn Infocom (and Activision) text adventure games, and kids are best served by being challenged. The game should not be just a mildly interactive episode that requires no real thought or skill.

If you think about it a bit more carefully, you will realise that I must also know paradoxical doesn't mean ""contradictory"", because it is clear from the context of what I said that I don't think your behaviour is ""contradictory"", in fact quite the opposite.

The point I am trying to make is that you shouldn't feel it acceptable (or indeed ""virtuous"") to disparage 40 million people collectively, whether they are your compatriots or not - it's still prejudice.

I wonder if there's any potential conflict of interest in having a Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs who was formerly a director of a food and biotechnology lobbying company and whose husband still runs the company.  

&gt;However, she criticised Labour's £500,000 official public consultation into genetically modified food, which is in turmoil following protests that it has been rigged. This week, two academics on a Food Standards Agency committee resigned in protest saying they could not support a spin exercise to promote GM food.  
'The Food Standards Agency should not be spending taxpayers' money promoting GM foods,' Mrs Spelman said.

My guess would be that the main reason the FSA shouldn't be spending taxpayers' money promoting GM foods is because they aren't giving it to her husband's company. The next move will be to cancel the public consultation, hold an enquiry, then start a new consultation exercise. I wonder who will get the contract for that- of course it will be because they offered the most cost-effective proposal and not because of any insider information they had about other tendered offers. Meanwhile she will have moved on into another position so there can be no possible conflict of interest.

One was taken by a music teacher who only ever talked about religious music and would play us different pieces each week and try to get us to talk about it. Eventually he gave up and it eventually turned into an unofficial study period where we could do whatever work we liked as long as we looked busy to any passing teachers.  
The other was taken by an elderly physics teacher who used to read passages from the Bible and mutter under his breath for a while then fall asleep. That's where I learned how to play poker.  
The situation is long due an overhaul. In my opinion it would make much more sense and would be much more useful if RE was made voluntary and a foreign language was made compulsory in its place- not any particular language, just one that the school happens to teach. I think that would be much more useful to pupils in the long-term. The worthwhile aspects of RE- comparing religions and getting to know a little more about the different ones- could then be incorporated into Life Skills or Citizenship or whatever it's called this year where it could be covered reasonably quickly without any spiritual content.

They relaxed into an even step with this one and everything else fell back into place. This meant that the emotions of the episode were allowed to play out a great deal more in that lovely bittersweet way that only the Doctor can deliver.  It also lets 11's humor play much better such as his impatience while waiting on the monster. 

I've felt through the season that the arc has been more of a shoehorned device than an axis of operation.  With the subtle allusions to Rory, this episode finally gave Amy and the Doctor back their depth.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I gotta disagree. While the Doctor is occasionally a jerk the examples there are not good ones. When he had to disguise himself as human in the Family of Blood/Human Nature two parter, he was in a huge rush, not really the time to carefully pick an era (plus the TARDIS seems to have a will of its own when it comes to picking times to land). Harriet Jones destroyed a race of aliens who had surrendered and were leaving, she shot them in the back. This is hardly the same as destroying the Daleks and Time Lords to prevent the destruction of reality. And wiping Donna's memory? The alternative was she died. Her brain was all ready fucking up, it was happening soon. Letting her die would be by FAR the jerkier move there. Is 10 minutes of being a Time Lord worth a human lifetime? It would be far more arrogant of the Doctor to think that, and far more selfish for him to keep around someone who understood him, if even for a little while, than to let them live at the cost of being alone. Taking away Jack's time traveling capabilities was the right thing to do: Jack is not a Time Lord. The Doctor can see the web of time in a (now) unique way. Jack cannot, and never could.

A lot of this commentary ignores one simple fact: The Doctor is not a human, he is an alien. An incredibly old alien who has experienced way more in 900 years than would seem possible even for that length of time. Of COURSE he occasionally comes off as cold and distant, if you personally had to push the button that killed everyone of your species you would too. 

That said, he definitely has his darkness, and that's why he works so well. The Doctor is genuinely scary. A God is the right description for him. There's a great line in one of the audio plays called ""Phobos"" after he scares away an emerging God of Fear by showing it what he was afraid of. First he shows it the things in the past that he is afraid of, then he shows it the things that he's afraid might happen in the future, and finally he shows it what he is most afraid of: the things he thinks he could do. At the end of the episode, his companion says something like, ""Everywhere we go, there are monsters, but you always beat them. Maybe. . . you're scarier than the monsters."" And that's the Doctor. ""The Oncoming Storm"" in a quirky, loveable package. Half eccentric college professor, half vengeful God.

Actually, I think ""a jerk"" is exactly what the Doctor isn't. He's very caring, it's just that he can't exactly empathize with little things. The things he's experienced are so great and terrible that the piddling suffering of human existence must seem tiny. He's like a God, with all the negative and positive things that entails.

I also was amused by the advertisement for those ""affected by the issues raised in this program"" bit at the end (after/during the credits). Amusing because it's a bit of forethought I would have, despite my past, lacked. 

I also loved how Van Gogh could see time (the gold lines just before it became a painting is the same effect they use for time energy), and it fits with his being able to see her sorrow about a loss, even though she didn't know she was sad, he could see her past. Perhaps this perception is what allowed him to see the beast?

Of course the doctor will be kind to Amy, he feels horrible about Rory's death, how much he meant to Amy (seen in the episode ""Amy's Choice""), and the fact that Rory was erased from time. Of course he's going to be nice to her to try and bring peace to himself.

As with all moments of time in flux, Amy could have saved Van Gogh's life, but not short of marrying him. Depression is such an interesting monster. You learn to fear feeling happy, because the emotional highs are always matched by emotional lows, eventually, afterwords. Until something breaks that cycle. The high that could have saved his life, became the low that took his life. To quote Riddick (from Pitch Black) ""Beautiful.""

The shirt was bought after looking for days and days and days, but it’s a very limited edition, so it doesn’t exist anymore. The bow ties are vintage, so I sourced them in a vintage shop, in a huge sack. I emptied the sack and found as many copies of that one as I could. The jackets are made specially for him, but based on a vintage tweed, a Harris Tweed. They’re ’60s bow ties, and the reason they’re ’60s is that the original tweed jacket that we fitted on Matt was a late period ’60s Harris Tweed. The bow ties are not clip-ons but we don’t do them up – they’re ready-tied bow ties, simply for ease of use.”

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  **Religion is important**. **People need it**, it gives them something to cling to and it **mostly makes the world a better place**. There's a reason millions of people to to church every week, and it's **not because they're brainwashed.**

Everything ive highlighted in bold is your opinion and not an actual fact.

""millions of people go to church every week""

In 2006 the BBC found that only 6.3% of people in the UK go to church, of those nearly 1/3rd are over the age of 65 (and subsequently raised in a generation that still attended church as a ""social rule""). (Church attendances are still falling so the following figures are actualy being generous)

The grand total of people who went to church in the UK in 2006 was under 3.7 million people, if you remove the people under 65 it was only 2.6 million people.

-----------------------------------------------

&gt;  There's a reason millions of people to to church every week

**Theres a reason that the other *57.3 million* people in the UK did not.**

-----------------------------------------------

&gt;  People need it

I think you will find that if you look into this the level of religion a country has is proportional to the violence/poverty/segregation etc. in said country.

The more secular a country the better it would seem, so no... people do not infact need it.

-----------------------------------------------

&gt;  and its not because they're brainwashed

Sorry but its exactly because of that, Kids do not have religion until its ""given"" to them. The absolute vast majority of people get religion because they parents induct them into their own religion without offering any alternatives.

The only way you can claim that someone was not pressured into a religion is if you only include people who took up a faith later in life on their own impulse without any social or work based pressure.

You need only look at the thousands of examples on any secular website/forum/group to learn of the myriad ways in which people are brainwashed and or blackmailed into a religion to see that it is seldom an informed and non pressured choice that results in a person of faith.

-----------------------------------------------

&gt;  Education about other peoples culture is also important.

I agree with this, But culture is more than faith so why should faith take the front seat in any of these discussions?

&gt;  Lest we all end up 100 years ago thinking natives are tantamount savages.

You do realise that during the height of the various attrocities the British Empire commited it was fundementaly ran by and influenced by the morals, teachings, beliefs and wishes of the Church of England?.

Do you know what message the loving spaniards happened to bring with them when they done the same to South America?

**The christian faith**, and all the non believers very quickly discovered just how loving and understanding Christian faith was when their own culture was burned to the ground around them and they got left with a bible a preacher and obiediance to the Vatican to guide them isntead.

Do not for one instant even try to insinuate that Religion took no part in the crimes against humanity that Europeans (and others) committed against ""the natives"" all those years ago.

The crusades that were ordered based solely on the ""fact"" that the people in the holy land deserved to die because they were infact savages who needed the teachings of christ to see the error of their ways.

And vice versa with the Jihads.

Or indeed the crimes against humanity that are still occurring in the middle east and other parts of the world to this day.

true,PSBlake,null,null,"The releases aren't single episodes - they're single *stories*.  Each story consists of multiple episodes, and can total between an hour (Black Orchid, Edge of Destruction, The Rescue, The Sontaran Experiment, The King's Demons, The Awakening) and five hours (The War Games), or even 7 hours (Trial of a Time Lord is actually four separate stories tied together by an over-arcing plot, but it's sold as a single box set).

Where should you start?  So long as you're generally familiar with the basic narrative structure of Doctor Who (Time travelling alien with some human companions thwart evil wherever they go), you can jump into any story.  The mythology builds over time, but unless it's something like the Key to Time, the Black Guardian Trilogy, the E-Space Trilogy, or the Trial of a Timelord, where multiple stories are linked, you're not really missing out tremendously by jumping around.

If it's your ambition to watch the whole series from An Unearthly Child to Survival, you've got a challenge ahead of you - To date, the BBC have only released about 91 of the 159 stories (counting the Fox Telemovie with Paul McGann, which is only available in Region 2).  Compounding the issue is the matter of the ""missing"" episodes, for which little or no footage survived various BBC purges in the 70s - worst of all, these are mostly Pat Troughton's episodes, and his performance was a brilliant departure from Hartnell's ""grumpy gramps"" portrayal.  Most confusing of all, the BBC is releasing the stories in more or less random order, but have announced plans to have the entire classic series available on DVD by 2012.

As for the best bang for your buck, that's tricky to say.  Even the shorter stories include tons of bonus material, all of which is top notch (especially the Stripped for Action documentary series, which is only slightly less interesting than it sounds - It's about comic strips).  In terms of raw runtime per dollar, there's The War Games and The Trial of a Timelord, both of which are pretty long, and neither of which is over $50.00.  Then again, War Games gets dull quick, and Trial features Colin Baker, when he still wasn't allowed to be likable.

The Beginning boxset has the first three stories of the entire series, and has a great deal of insight into the creation and shaping of the series in general.  The Invisible Enemy boxset features the introduction of K9, and has the pilot to the K9/Sarah-Jane spinoff which never got made.  Both versions of The Five Doctors are excellent, although the changes to the more recent edition do change established events somewhat.  The New Beginnings boxset has the end of the Fourth Doctor's tenure, and the start of the Fifth's.

true,Plattnerite,null,null,"Perhaps you're right, but it just seemed to stand out too much to me.  The whole basis of the episode was on art and the attention to detail seemed extremely involved.  Vincent's room looks like it could come directly from a painting.  Looking back, I believe this is due to the orientation of the objects in the room.  The empty chair, desk, and open window are seemingly aligned in point perspective.  

With this much detail put in, the posters just seemed so out of place.  Their placement is sporadic and unevenly spaced until the scene with the TARDIS; then the posters are rigidly aligned and ordered.  For an episode that seems so orderly, their insertion everywhere else is chaotic.  Also, Rue de Richelieu is seemingly a [well known]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rue_de_Richelieu) street in Paris.  The café is located in [Arles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafe_Terrace_at_Night), France.  Why would there be advertisements for a place that is 700km (~435 miles) away in an empty alley?  In either case, I am curious if I’ve fallen into the trap of seeing a pattern that isn’t there.  It just seems that this episode in particular had *so much* attention to detail.

I agree, but I, like many other children, went to a church school, despite neither of my parents being very religious at all. If you're at a C of E or Catholic school, it's understandable that Christianity would be treated differently.

And move from an unhealthy environment (filled with toxic matter and energy) to an environment that is health promoting (filled with love and support and a vision of a better future), and illness will disappear.  Biology is definitely being affected, and nearly every human (and all other social animals) is born with the capacity to be sick, so internal~biology is indeed a part of this, but when it comes to whether a person is sick or not, it's the environment that makes the primary difference, rather than the individual person.

Each episodes gets a point value :

- 3 - In my top favorite episodes of all times

- 2 - I really enjoyed the episodes

- 1 - I liked the episode

- 0 - I am neutral toward it

- Minus 1 - I didn't like it

- Minus 2 - I hated it

- Minus 3 - It makes me want to vomit rather than watch it again.


**Series 1 - 9th Doctor / Rose**

- Rose - **0 point**. If it weren't the ""pilot"", it would get minus 1

- The End of the World : **0 point**. 

- The Unquiest Dead : **Minus 1 point**. Boring.

- Aliens of London : **1 point**. 

- World War Three : **1 point**

- Dalek : **1 point**

- The Long Game : **0 point**

- Father's Day : **3 point**, really touching. My 4th favorite episode

- The Empty Child : **1 points**

- The Doctor Dances : **2 points** (I want to give a total of 3 points )

- Boom Town : **1 point**

- Bad Wolf : **2 points**

- The Parting of ways : **3 points**


Total for Series 1 : 14 points

**Series 2 : 10th Doctor / Rose**

- Christmas Invasion : 1 Point
- New Earth : **1 Point**  (I am actually torn on this one. I love Face of Boe(+1), and HATE Cassandra(minus 1). The Zombie finale is the tie-breaker.
- Tooth And Claw :** 0 point**. Not bad, not good.
- School Reunion : **2 points**
- The Girl in the Fireplace : **3 points**. My 2nd favorite episode
- Rise of the Cybermen : **2 points**
- The Age of Steel : **2 points**
- The Idiot's Lantern :** Minus 3 points**. COME ON.
- The Impossible Planet : **1 point**
- The Satan Pit : **Minus 2 points** (that's right, part 1 I liked, but I hated the second part)
- Love &amp; Monster : **Minus 1 point** (but I don't see it as a normal Doctor Who episode)
- Fear Her : **Minus 3 points**.
- Army of Ghost : **3 points**
- Doomsday : 3 points, plus 1 point for the epilogue. Yeap, that's **4 point**. To me, it's that's strong.

Total for Series 2 : Only 8 points. The series finale (for 7 points), almost salvaged it alone.

**Series 3 : 10th Doctor / Martha**

- Runaway Bride : I wanted to put with season 4, but since I rate it at ** 0**, it doesn't matter
- Smith And Jones : **2 points**. The Judoon are really hot
- The Shakespeare Code: **0 points**. I don't dislike it or like it. Shakespeare is amazing, but the witches are boring.
- Gridlock : **3 points** (my 3rd favorite episode)
- Daleks and Manhattan :** 0 points**
- Evolution of the Dalek : **Minus 1 point** (perhaps I am being too generous)
- The Lazarus Experiment : **Minus 2 points **
- 42 : **0 points** (if it weren't for the fact it was in real time, I would put Minus 2 points)
- Human Nature : **2 Points**
- Family of Blood : **2 points**
- Blink : **3 points** (my favorite non-finale episode)
- Utopia :** 2 points**
- The Sound of Drums : **3 points**
- Last of the Time lords : **2 points** (the fairy tale ending didn't do it for me )

Toal for Series 3 : 16 points

**Series 4 : 10th Doctor / Donna **
(I don't remember enough of Voyage of the Damned to rate it. Saw it only once)

- Partners in Crime : **2 points**, because it's funny
- The Fire of Pompeii :** Minus 1 points**, because it's boring
- Planet of the Ood : **2 points**, probably my favorite of the series 3, because it's touching and clever
- The Sontaran Stratagem : **0 point**
- The Poison Sky : **0 point** (I liked the return of Martha, but the episodes don't do anything for me)
- Doctor's Daughter :** 1 point** (and only because of Martha AND Jenny)
- Unicorn and the Wasp :** Minus 2 points**
- Silence in the Library : **2 points**
- Forest of the dead : **1 point** : I used to put it at 3, but the new developments with River Song are changing my mind retroactively.
- Midnight :** 1 point**
- Turn Left : **2 points**
- The Stolen Earth : **3 points**
- Journey's End : 0 point plus **1 point** for the epilogue with Rose.

Total for Series 4 : 12 points

** Post-Season 4 10th Doctor Specials **

- The next doctor : **2 **Used to have 3 points until last week, but it is now my #6 favorite episode
- The Planet of the Dead : **0 **: Yawn
- The Water of Mars :** 1 + 2 points** for the ""The laws of time are mine and **they will obey me** speech.
- The End of Time, part 1 : **0 points**
- The End of Time, part 2 :** Minus 1 point**

Total for the specials : 4 points

** Series 5 : 11th Doctor / Amy **

- The Eleventh Hour : **2 points**. I really had high hopes at that point
- The Beast Below : **1 point**, but the ending really bothered me
- Victory of the Daleks : **Minus 1 points**. I can'r really even give it a zero
- The Time of Angels : **2 point**. The prologue alone was worth 1 point, and the climax the other point
- Flesh and Stone : Minus 3 points +1 point for the future doctor (so, **Minus 2 points**)_
- The Vampires of Venice : **Minus 2 points**. 
- Amy's Choice :** 1 point**. If there is a sequel, I might raise this value
- The Hungry Earth :** Minus 1 point**
- Cold Blood : **Minus 3 points**
- Vincent and the Doctor : **3 points.** It is my #5 favorite non-finale episode, putting ""The Next Doctor"" in 6th place

Total so far : Minus 1. It should finish in the positive because I am hoping the finale is worth at least 4 points. I am just hoping The Lodger doesn't suck, but it sounds like a low-budget Doctor Who episode à la ""fear her"".

Ranking so far :

- 6 - Series 5, with a Minus 1 balance

- 5 - The Post-Series 4 specials : 4 points

- 4 - Series 2 : 8 points

- 3 - Series 4 : 12 points

- 2 - Series 1 : 14 points

- 1 - Series 3 : 16 points

That Series 3 won isn't surprising to me. 2 of my favorite episodes are in it, and Martha is my favorite full-time companion, but my favorite companion is Rose, Series 2 finale and on. Before the season 2 finale, I don't like her that much, but in Army of Ghost, she changes and I prefer her. Too bad she leaves right afterwards.

What does surprises me is that Series 1 ranks so high. I prefer the 10th Doctor a lot more than the 9th, but most of the episodes I hated a lot where with the 10th Doctor, dropping his score.

Then again, the first 2 of the 9th Doctor were the first two episodes, so I forgive a lot I wouldn't further down the series...

I hope this was interesting. I was fun to compile !

In both these examples, I cared about the characters, one is Rose's dead father, and the other is one of the greatest painters.

In Satan Pit, I didn't care about the characters like I did, say, for 42. But then again, I saw 42 three times and Satan Pit only once.

&gt; I LOVED Human Nature and Family of Blood. Just the whole John Smith wanting his life as it is, and wanting that future; the Doctor trying to recapture just a bit of what John Smith had with that lady. Those might possibly be my favourite episodes.

I loved both, which is why they both got 2 points. I decided to reserve 3 points for my top 5 episodes only, and while they are in my top 10, they are not in my top 5...",0,1275938055,null,0,false,0,c0rlmt4,t3_ccay0,t1_c0rlmt4,t1_c0rlkfv,null,1426334339,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Vincent and the Doctor is probably one of the most ingenious and touching episodes I've watched in a long time. 

After Evolution of the Daleks, I actually think that Victory of the Daleks is better for the series, but still terrible all together. 

I see The Empty Child and The Doctor Dances as probably the best episodes of series one. Its one of the few times where we see something good happen. Additionally it introduces Jack Harkness as a scoundrel who.. although still being a bit of a scoundrel.. becomes a rather honorable and endearing character. 

I like Human Nature/Family of Blood a lot, but I think it would have been better earlier in the season. It would have made the whole ""YOU ARE NOT ALONE"" less apparent at the end of the series. 

Sound of Drums - Fantastic. Last of the Time Lords - not so fantastic. The Fairy Tale ending really caused me hate that episode.

true,mpierre,tardis,TARDIS,"&gt; I found Fires of Pompeii to introduce a very interesting plot device, the fixed moment in time, which came into play later on in Waters Of Mars. I enjoy how angry he is when he is not allowed to help someone.

You are right, I forgot it was the point where the fixed point in time was introduced. I didn't rewatch Fires of Pompeii since I saw Waters of Mars, so perhaps it would raise it.

I do love when he gets angry at not being able to help someone, so I guess I forgot that for this episode.

If I feel it well, it might gain 2 points to a positive 1. It could bring Series 4 and Series 1 at a tie for second place !

&gt; Vincent and the Doctor is probably one of the most ingenious and touching episodes I've watched in a long time.

Agreed ! That's why I gave it 3 points

&gt; After Evolution of the Daleks, I actually think that Victory of the Daleks is better for the series, but still terrible all together.

I agree with you. I might have put a minus 0.5, but I decided not to use .5 points as to not complicate it too much.

&gt; I see The Empty Child and The Doctor Dances as probably the best episodes of series one. Its one of the few times where we see something good happen. Additionally it introduces Jack Harkness as a scoundrel who.. although still being a bit of a scoundrel.. becomes a rather honorable and endearing character.

I thought to perhaps give 4 points to this serial, but I don't think it deserves that 4th point. There is something I can't put my finger on which prevent it from getting the perfect 4 points.

(Remember, only season finales and my top 5 episodes can get 3 points).

&gt; I like Human Nature/Family of Blood a lot, but I think it would have been better earlier in the season. It would have made the whole ""YOU ARE NOT ALONE"" less apparent at the end of the series.

I don't agree with you. This episode needed a very good chemistry between Martha and the Doctor, otherwise, it wouldn't have worked.

Also, the one other new ""devices"" for the finale are close to the actual finale, such as looking in the earth of the TARDIS in Boom Town.

If I am right, the disappearance of Rory will have something important to do with the finale and will have occurred 2 episodes before the finale.

&gt; Sound of Drums - Fantastic. Last of the Time Lords - not so fantastic. The Fairy Tale ending really caused me hate that episode.

That's why Sound of Drums got 3 points, and Last of the Time Lord got 2. I ALMOST gave only 1 point, but the episode had a lot of good dramatic moment. And when the 10th tells the Master ""A gun ? You really think I would have used a GUN ?""

That exchange is very good...

For fun - they have the Flight Control TARDIS, which makes noises based on how it is moved.  It's for the toy line, but still really cool.  Even if you don't have figures, it makes a cool hidden storage area - good for hidden cash, car keys, etc)

For just fun party stuff, you can spray paint ""BAD WOLF"" on paper and hang it somewhere.   Or make a cake that just says ""BAD WOLF"" or cupcakes.  Or find a template for the Crack from the current series, print it out large and tape it to the wall.  Maybe print some ""VOTE SAXON"" flyers and tack them up (you should be able to find templates from Google or just make one in Word).

You are misunderstanding my idea. I'm not assuming that the government is automatically evil, I'm saying that demagogy is used all the time to push forward policies that are not popular. 

The idea that citizens are the state's number one enemy comes from The Prince. Machiavelli is simply advising a prince to take care of its own citizens because they are the ones who are more likely to overthrow a government, even more than other countries. In a way, citizens are both the best ally and the worst enemy of a State. Since governments are more or less a self-sufficient sphere, they also want to secure their stability and thus the necessity of controlling or maintaining its population ""happy.""

&gt;Generally I'm sure when they create these laws they honestly don't intend for them to be used outside of the scope they envision

I feel there is no possible way to really get to a generalization like this. Your standing point is people act in an honest way that's very positive of you. I, on the other hand, feel that people, especially in power, will try to secure their place. If honesty serves this then they will be honest.

&gt;Most politicians are fundamentally trying to do the right thing. 

See, honesty here is in the way of properly assessing the validity of policies or ideas. Things like ""give me your liberty and I'll give you freedom"" or ""let me keep an eye on your private life, if you don't have anything to hide then you don't have anything to fear"" might be pushed forward by the most honest and not evil politician but this is irrelevant if the idea can bring consequences like the one from the article.

That's why the 'world series' is only played in North America?

The only reason that the US dominates the team sports that it does is that they barely play them anywhere else. Except hockey, which Canada would hand your ass to you anytime in.

We also have rugby in the UK, which is similar to American football, but without body armour - we've played friendlies against the US in that, and owned you there too.

But the only reason that I'm ripping on you right now is that you're in the game. You're part of this now, and this is just a rite of passage. You might think what I've written is insulting, but even though you're going to get owned like little girls on Saturday, the fact that you're being taunted, if you're smart enough to see why, should be a badge of honour.

""Seasons of Fear"" is one of the strongest audio adventures I've heard. It's an 8th Doctor/Charley episode. ""Embrace the Darkness"" is also super good. These two follow sequentially after ""Chimes of Midnight"" which is on your list above.

The 8th Doctor ""Other Universe"" storyline which starts with [Neverland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverland_(Doctor_Who_audio) and ends (roughly) with [The Girl who Never Was](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_Who_Never_Was) and spans 18 stories is very good as well.

What I'd actually recommend is checking out [the full list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_audio_plays_by_Big_Finish) on Wikipedia (be sure to sort by ""Series Sorted"", it's much easier to figure out the order that way) and listening all the way through the 8th Doctor/Charley, and then the 6th Doctor/Charley episodes.

Rose: Shit episode. What the fuck is up with that?

End of the World: Introduces some characters for you, but you could figure it out without that episode. It's kinda in the middle. 

Unquiet dead: I didn't like it. It has only minimal bearing on the series. It's kinda funny for a relaxed episode but putting that famous guy in it was pointless. Middle-low episode

Aliens of London/Wold War Three: I don't like the Slitheen or whatever... They are a bit funny. But the episode introduces Harriet Jones. She is kinda important. It does give some good insight into how the 9th Doctor works and thinks. A middle episode

Dalek: It's kinda far-fetched, but it also gives some interesting views as to the dynamics between the Doctor and Rose. Watch it because it's a little neat and you need a character introduced for next episode. A middle episode

Long Game: Ties directly into the Finale. Watch it. Middle-high episode just because of the ""Time goes by like that"" thing. teehee

Father's Day: I think it's a very good episode. The dragon things are odd and kinda silly but it's a good episode. Makes me a little sad. High episode.

Empty Child/Doctor Dances: Highlight of this series. It has a good balance of action, emotion, comedy, and a character is introduced. High epsiode

Boom Town: Ties into Aliens of London and WW3. I have a lot of thoughts on it. Middle Episode

Bad Wolf/Parting of the Ways: Finale episodes. First one is weird and then it kinda makes sense. Must watch. It's the Finale afterall.

Most of the mystery of it would have excited fans I think (Rose was my first episode too, so I just wanted to get into seeing this ""Doctor"" being a total time-travelling badass), and the Autons were an old enemy of the Doctor, so that helped give it some...historical authenticity? And at least showed fans that they could make Doctor Who a 21st century show even with old villains.

What you've got to remember with DW is that it is tongue-in-cheek early-evening family entertainment, and as such may appear cheesy or have a lot of situations that don't reward hardcore fans of sci-fi or horror or time-travel etc.

But keep watching and you'll notice that the writing becomes stronger, the characters more fleshed out, and the episodes as a whole more fulfilling. Once everything becomes established, who's who and what's what, then it is very satisfying enjoying each new adventure.

Sure there are low points, and when they're bad, they're really bad (see Love and Monsters), yet when they're good, they're excellent (see Blink). It's a mixed bag, but you'll be rewarded for persevering.

BP is acting responsibly and Obama is just waving his cock about and hindering their efforts...

Obama is driving the share price down during a very crucial stage of the clean up. 

How he thinks that wiping billions off the companies worth is going to help clean up oil I just don't know.

And what's with calling it ""British Petroleum""? That's not the name of the company. It hasn't been for 12 years.  

Obamas anti british sentiment isn't particularly professional either. We get it, Obama. Your grandad you never met got tortured by the british. 

Guess what? A lot of people got beaten up, killed, slaughtered by the british. However, of course, I can exchange the word British for any nation and it would still hold true. 

All nations have a history we would rather forget. Native Americans, anyone? 

Lest we forget that it was the American government that allowed the drilling off the gulf coast in the first place. 

Everyone's played their part here, and it seems BP is the **only** one not shifting blame and trying to weasel out of it. 

They could have dug their toes in and blamed transocean from the start, but they didn't. They've not said much about transocean at all.

There are pros and cons to that model, including the introduction of soft degrees, like golf management, because it still brings in money from students and central government (who part fund EU students). If government were to see education as an investment and provide block funds for specific areas rather than a mechanism for per student charging, then the soft degrees would probably reduce but the lines of the unemployed youth would increase.

These days, you get kids falling out of school with a D and an E in Art and Meeja Studies, who then wander over to the nearest former-polytechnic to get their 'degree'. Then when it's all over they wonder why nobody wants to employ them.

It reminds me of something I heard on Radio 1 a year or two ago. There was some girly airhead 'celeb' guest with a gabby female DJ talking to potential uni applicants. The message they were quite literally giving was, don't worry about the work! Just go, hav a larf innit! You meet new people and get pissed for 3 years!

Now I know that's a big part of uni for everyone, but what you see with a lot of people going now is that they think that's pretty much all it is. And lets face it, the amount of work that's in their mickey mouse degrees could be finished in a couple of months if not sooner, instead of being dragged out for 3 expensive wasteful pointless years.

In fact the same design for the ship was used in the S3 SJA opener where they pulled the Roswell ship designs from a database. 

Personally, not a huge fan of either.   I have found when they try to move DW to other media, they tend to do grandiose stories that they couldn't do on TV.  However, it doesn't feel like a DW story anymore when they do.  So I think some of the budget restrictions on the show are important for molding the story.  Plus, the CGI was horrible.   And they completely wasted David Warner.  He has such a great voice and they distorted it.   And Moffett used her natural accent, which sounds weird in a 1950's diner in the New Mexico desert.

People have got so used to the US doing what they want around the world by force that they forget they still have to operate within the laws of the USA. So under what law can he do anything other than fine a foreign registered company.  Does anyone know ? Given that, then the entire drop in the BP share price is indeed based on nothing.

No, but as the article you posted helpfully explains:

&gt; ""I don't expect anyone in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland to support England - they've got their own countries to support,"" he crackles down a phone line from South Africa.  ""Actively supporting whoever's playing us, though, just seems pathetic. We should all get over it.

Speaking as an English person I have no problem with Scots, Welsh or N. Irish people not supporting England - after all, while England's still in the competition we don't really support their teams, either.

The difference is that on the rare occasions when England goes out before Scotland, N.I. Wales we revert from ""England"" fans to ""Great Britain"" fans, and will happily cheer for our GB bretheren.

We're English first, but we're still British, and will still root for any British team when England's not in it.

In contrast, not only are ABE Scottish, Welsh (etc) fans not rooting for England *at all* (even when their teams have been knocked out), but they're actively supporting anyone apart from England.

That's a long way from identifying as ""English first and British second"", and more like identifying as aggressively and pro-actively anti-English.  That's less ""patriotism first"" and more just ""resentful nationalism"".

It's the difference between prioritising your country but recognising we're all on the same side, and being aggressively anti- your neighbours.

This comment (again from the article you posted) sums it up perfectly:

&gt; Fervent England supporter Mark Perryman, author of Ingerland: Travels With A Football Nation and a proponent of a tolerant, progressive English patriotism, says many of his fellow fans are perplexed and even hurt by this hostility from sides they would traditionally have backed when their own were not playing.

So yeah, not supporting a neighbouring team is your choice, but actively supporting anyone who tries to knock us out is just a sour-grapes dick move.

You think that ABE is anti-England as a nation? I suppose thats understandable as it is in the nature of England to project a huge level of national pride and event onto its football team, certainly far more than Scotland does. In most Scots eyes, England simply takes the thing far too seriously.

The assumption in the media/marketing world is that the Scots should share and contribute to this pride. The frustration at this manifests itself as humour. This is ginger-wig stuff.... not serious nationalism.

&gt;It may not be serious (although again, I think this varies by person) but after everything you've said I don't think you can seriously make a case that it's not anti-England.

I think a large part of the Scottish identity is shaped by 'not English'. Your sporting events, especially on these occasions where it is being obscenely rammed down our throats (literally if you buy pizza from asda) is a perfect time to indulge in this. Perhaps its nuance, but this is NOT anti-England on a real level.

Honestly I'm not sure I want to be part of this community if it ends up being digg/Twitter/facebook/YouTube.

The Deep Horizon industrial accident is bad, perhaps really bad but it is just one more accident in a long line of such events.  Do people really believe it is possible to legislate zero fuck ups? 

Here is a [list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_industrial_disasters) courtesy of WikiPedia that details a few of the most well known industrial accidents.  You will notice that they occur frequently across a broad range of industries and locations.  I see no sign that we will ever achieve a totally accident free record whilever the engineering complexity required to sustain our existence on this planet continually increases.

America has a lot of blood on its hands and dirt under its nails from corporations, foreign policy and corrupt governance.  However this is ignored, encouraged and demanded by a populace that fosters a ""fuck you, I'm alright attitude"".  Lest we forget, it was only in the last few years that the green movement began to gain traction and there are still millions driving around in big ass SUV's, HumVees and pick-up-trucks just because ""we can"".  

I suggest that the US (without any help from BP) is responsible for the large majority of global environmental disasters over the years at the expense of others.  I include in this list, the development, proliferation and use of the atomic bomb, large CO2 emissions that cemented global warming, pollution of land, oceans, atmosphere (and now space).  On top of this, the US has, in recent history, subjected entire countries of innocents to bombing, embraced slavery, killed iand tortured ts own citizens, taken the global economy to the edge of the abyss and fostered a world view that belief in god trumps intelligent thought.

Yes, Britain has a hell of a lot to answer for, but I think in light of US history, it's more than a little hypocritical to single out BP.  The main thing is to fix the problems, and quickly.  Can it be done quicker? maybe... But I am quite certain it is being worked by smart people (our fellow redditors even) with more passion than you might think.  Just remember... How long did it take to figure out how the US fucked up Challenger, Vietnam, West Virginia mines, Bhopal, Exxon Valdez, Iraq, Afghanistan, the war on drugs, sub-prime mortgages...

I still say BP doesn't deserve half the blame it is getting.  If It could be shown that within the organization there was a systemic problem that came from the top which promoted a slap dash attitude I would agree... But I have not been convinced without a shadow of a doubt that this is the case.

What we have here is a mega-corporation, that is a bunch of guys and girls like us here on reddit.  We do our best at what we do and sometimes we fuck up... Normally a fuck up or two is no big deal, but occasionally with a super complex project involving dozens of different companies, layers upon layers of bureaucracy, boat loads of contractors, millions of tons of steel and chemicals and shit... Well a few fuck ups can really fuck things up good and proper.

Aside from that, for the two Simpson characters, Smithers is not cool, and Krusty is a clown, and a clowns clothing is supposed to be funny, not cool.

* And we can rule out the on comic-book character, Jimmy Olsen, because he has never been, nor shall he ever be, cool.

* We can count out the two women wearing bow-ties, because they are not wearing them to be cool, they are wearing  them to be rebellious, which in turn makes them only cool in their own eyes.

* This pretty much leaves up with Indiana Jone's father, who was clueless and nerdy to a fault (not cool)... Pee Wee Herman, who can be considered cool, only because he is incredibly NOT cool and completely oblivious to this fact, which is amusingly cool... Bill Ney the Science guy, who is a geek and therefor not really cool... Doctor Who, who has no true idea or care what is cool or not because he is an alien that gets perpetually lost throughout time...

And the trailer for next week! River Song mentions Daleks, Sontarans, Cyberships, Nestene (Autons) and Slitheen. These have all appeared since the series reboot in 2005. She also mentions Chelonians (a turtle-like race only ever appearing so far in the non-canon novels, comics and audios) and Drahvins (a warlike tribe of women only ever appearing in the lost Hartnell story 'Galaxy 4'). Looks like there will be quite a bit of fanwank in the finale, which is awesome.

The Pandorica, I suspect, is empty. It's a prison awaiting its prisoner - The Doctor. In the trailer, the Doctor mentions (assuming he's referring to the myth of the Pandorica) ""there was a goblin. Or a trickster. Or a warrior. Soaked in the blood of a billion galaxies"". That's as apt a description of the Doctor as any you would get from the races he's defeated over the decades. The Pandorica is a trap. Although by now they should know ""there's one thing you never put in a trap"" etc....

The character of River Song has fascinated me since her meeting with Tennant's Doctor. After reading, that the theory she was The Rani, i did a quick background reading and her tardis is able to disguise itself as anything, (maybe the top floor of a house - as seen in the lodger?) It would also explain her knowledge of flying the tardis, and her scientific explorer persona, somehting The Rani was famed for. It had been referenced that the two of them had formed a relationship (The Rani and the doctor). Did they get married? She know his real name? Was she part of the special group of time lords (The Deca).

~ Looking back at appearances made by The Rani, she appeared, the Doctor is visiting a town called Killingworth, any connection with Leadworth? thoughts please...

I also like the theories circulating about the two timelines and having looked back, the shadow that crosses infront of Amelia's window as she waits for him, could well be the Doctor returning to tell the 7yr old Amelia something important. 

The jacket as well from 'Flesh and Stone'. He loses his jacket then reappears briefly to talk to Amy, wearing his jacket, then when it shows him again - no jacket! The way that short scene was acted out, it does come across as the Doctor is someone else, talking to Amy in a more softer, caring tone. 

I'm looking forward to seeing whre this 2 parter will finish and i am intregued as to what is in this Pandorica' box? River Song says she's in a storm cage because she killed a man (the best man she ever knew), not the Doctor? But if in fact there are two timelines going at the moment, throughout the series, they could converge finally at the opening of Pandorica and River could end up killing one of the Doctors?

I would *like* to not have to care and i'm honestly not *that* bothered, but i'm sure that i'm speaking for a Scottish majority when I say that I would absolutely *hate* it if they won since we would have to endure their gloating on an epic scale being rammed down our throats.

true,[deleted],null,null,"As a Scot living in England, I think I can give some possible insight into this.

1. The media is taking a relatively small phenomenon, and building it into something mega important, as is their want.

2. There is a small contingent of Scots (and Welsh and Irish) who genuinely want England to bomb out in spectacular style. We have a *very* long memory, and our historicalinjustice gland goes into overdrive on occasions like this.

3. There has always been a friendly rivalry between England and Scotland, and there always will be. It is a bit of fun. We take the piss out of each other, and we are the better for it. Take it for what it is. We (Scotland) didn't qualify, so we need to support someone. Some of us support England, some of us want England to fuck up in glorious style. So what? It's just football. I remember (with horrible clarity) watching the 1990 match between Scotland and Costa Rica. I was in Coventry at the time, and the English fans pissed themselves with laughter when we lost. I still have a copy of the student union magazine which had a special on the match - ""Lack of Scottish goalkeeping skills is not a problem you can solve by simply throwing money at it"", with a picture of a bag of money being kicked at our keeper. He missed it. I expected nothing less from my English brethren. Don't get all indignant when it happens the other way around.

4. We are genuinely fed up with hearing about 1966. **1966** for fucks sake. 44 fucking years ago. Let it go. Seriously.

5. There is a genuine (but probably unintentional) bias in English sporting reporting. An English sports victory is an English vistory, but a Scottish (or Welsh or NI) victory is a UK victory. I have met English people who genuinely think of Scotland as 'just another English county'.

In short, don't worry about it. Mostly, it is just a bit of fun, and not worth the crap the media make of it.

I watched the England/USA match, and I was genuinely stoked for Gerrard when he scored in the opening minutes. I also laughed when Green fucked up like a pub league newbie. The point is, England is not *our* national team, and you need to stop expecting us to behave like it is.

Also, it's just fucking football. A bunch of overpaid knobs chasing a pigs bladder around a field.",0,1276474357,null,0,true,0,c0s1a8b,t3_cemg1,t1_c0s1a8b,t3_cemg1,null,1426341727,29,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,29
