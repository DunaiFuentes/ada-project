true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"&gt; Surveys show that third of the public think that some responsibility for rape can be attributed to the victim. Lady Stern said: ""I think rape should be really discussed a lot. I think the idea that a woman going out at night and getting drunk and not minding herself can be compared with leaving your house door open so you are burgled really needs to be examined in the cool light of day. You need to ask: 'Do you really mean that?'

Yes.  Yes I do.  In the same way that leaving your door unlocked doesn't negate or diminish the criminality or evil of a robber, recognising that the victim had *any part whatsoever* in the fact they were raped does not in any way negate or diminish the criminality of evil of the person who raped them.

However, in the same way someone who leaves their door open and gets robbed should admit to themselves and others that they made a stupid mistake (even if they paid a disproportionate price for it), I think it's right and important that someone who goes out, *intentionally and by choice* gets paralytically drunk and then gets raped accept that their actions in some way contributed to their assault.

I'm not interested in ""blaming the victim"", or excusing their attackers for the incident, but I do think it's ludicrous that we commonly understand and agree with the concept of at least ""having had a hand in your own downfall"" for every stupid decision people can possibly make *apart* from the one where they become intoxicated to the point they can't look after themselves in questionable company and end up getting raped.

Nothing in this principle suggests it was mostly or entirely the victim's fault (or that they bear anything other than a *token* responsibility), nothing in this principle in any way diminishes or negates the evil or fault of the perpetrator, and (most importantly) nothing in this argument suggests the victim should bear any responsibility for incidents like drink-spiking, ""classic"" rape (being jumped in an alley-way, etc), or similar.

However, where the victim made a *choice* to go out and get so pissed they couldn't function, and then ends up leaving with someone they don't know (or shouldn't trust), and *then* gets raped, I think it's important for them to recognise and admit that perhaps some of their choices leading up to the incident were... sub-optimal... even if only to prevent them and others making the same mistakes again.",0,1268649715,null,0,false,0,c0m87vw,t3_bdigr,t1_c0m87vw,t3_bdigr,null,1426242825,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"There are many reasons (both good and bad) why society has gotten to the point where it's practically considered taboo to suggest the rape victim might have had any responsibility whatsoever, including but not limited to:

* Historically (and still in many cultures) women (the majority of rape victims) were routinely blamed for their own rapes - the man was seen as a helpless slave to his baser urges, and if the woman was raped it was concluded it must have been her fault (for dressing provocatively, etc).  This is because men were the dominant sex, and it's wonderfully self-serving to be able to rape with impunity and disclaim any responsibility.  It's also much easier for family members and the community to blame the (usually powerless) victim than to challenge a possibly powerful or dominant male for doing it.  Attempting to redress this injustice, as a society we over-swing back the other way, and decide *absolutely none* of the responsibility is the victim's.

* Prosecutors in rape cases often try to push the *blame* for a rape onto the victim - ""she was promiscuous"", ""she consented at the time then recanted"", etc.  For this reason there's a legitimate need to protect the victim from quite literally having insult added to injury... but again public opinion over-swings and it becomes taboo to criticise the victim *at all*... even where it might be objectively warranted.

* As a society we tend to ignore the fact that it's perfectly possible for the victim to be partly responsible for the incident without that reducing or negating the attacker's crime.  Theft from an unlocked house is still theft, and it's still just as *morally* wrong as theft from a locked house, but people seem to believe that if the victim is partly to blame for their own predicament, that necessarily excuses the attacker somewhat.  This is complete bunk, but it explains why people tend to instantly characterise even legitimate criticism of the victim as unfairly ""blaming the victim"", or ""excusing the attacker"".

* Finally, yes, it is indeed to the advantage of rape victims to be able to claim rape and instantly be entitled to support, consideration and to be exempt from criticism, and to some sick or unscrupulous people it's a tempting way out of an otherwise-difficult situation.  You can be a promiscuous person who slept with a really unattractive person, an evil cheater or a poor, innocent victim who gets emotional support, attention and who nobody's allowed to criticise - obviously if you have no scruples the third option is the most comfortable one.

I make no argument as to the relative merits or frequencies of these reasons, or claim that any or all of them necessarily apply in any or all cases.

I also recognise that rape is a very difficult subject, and recognition of these factors *in no way* necessarily implies anything about any particular case.  However, I think our current attitudes to rape are extremely distorted and inconsistent (especially between the genders), and I think it's important for society to try to tend back towards a sensible, equal middle-ground where all victims and *accused* attackers are treated fairly by society (regardless of gender), and not to simply stay as we are, or to over-swing back the *other* way again.",0,1268656105,null,0,false,0,c0m8b5t,t3_bdigr,t1_c0m8b5t,t1_c0m8a6t,null,1426242867,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

&gt;Research funded by Salford University said that schools were increasingly becoming a “hotbed for surveillance practices” in the UK as children were subjected to checks for often **mundane reasons such as borrowing a book from a library or paying for lunch**. [Emphasis mine]

These 'checks', as they put it are that the kid has a student card which is scanned so that books are assigned to the student. All libraries in the country have been doing this for decades, as it's simple to maintain. For convenience, these cards can also have money put on them by the child's parent(s) so that the kid can *only* spend that money on school dinners, and can not have the money stolen off them by another kid or spent on sweets. This is all perfectly innocent.

CCTV in schools is usually there to protect the school building, but is also useful when trying to work out what kid has smashed a school window, especially when you are billing the parent for the damage. Using CCTV in the classroom and the toilet is wrong, and I don't agree with that at all, and I don't know of any school, or even university, that is using fingerprint technology. It's too pricy!

It's an interesting question. If you're implying the only alternative would be to relocate Hong Kong's citizens here then the question falls down to whether or not there are any benefits to the UK. If the benefits outweight the drawbacks then bring the benefits to the UK, it's only natural (given that we built Hong Kong). If the drawbacks outweigh the benefits then let them stay in Hong Kong.

What actually happened was that the benefits went to Canada and the West Coast of the US before slowly returning back to Hong Kong.

Have you tried drugs and disliked them, or perhaps seen the negative effects of drug prohibition in your community?  I'm wondering if you have personal reasons for that stance or because you just think drugs are bad m'kay (either way, your opinion is valid and I wouldn't want to suggest otherwise).

I wouldn't say that I'm particularly pro-drugs.  I've taken them on occasion (and generally enjoyed the experience), but I've also seen the damage they can do (although alcohol outstrips all the illegal drugs as far as I'm concerned).  However, I am in favour of individual choice for those who want to take drugs.

I believe that drug prohibition is a failure.  It's easier for kids (like mine) to get cannabis than it is for them to get tobacco.  Bad stuff should be regulated legally - that's how you make it *harder* for people to get hold of, as counter-intuitive as it seems.  The idea of people making, buying and consuming pills, all without any proper oversight, regulation, health and safety checks, etc., fills me with dread. 

If people are going to take drugs (and they are, regardless of any political policy) then I believe we have a responsibility as a society to make them as safe as possible. 

Cars kill many more people than drugs.  But we don't pass laws demanding that cars are banned.  Instead we pass laws requiring people to be properly educated in driving, to wear a seat belt and to have proper insurance in case something does go wrong.  I think we should be doing the same thing with drugs.  Legalise them and restrict the manufacture, sale and consumption to properly licensed premises.  Remove the black market and you remove a large part of the problem that drugs cause.

This deal where the cops have vehicles recovered to their ""preferred"" recovery pals stinks. They will simply tell you that ""your insurance will pay"".

A friend of mine runs a van hire business and he made great pains to tell the cops that he would recover himself, but when a van was stolen they recovered it anyway. He refused to pay so the garage refused to release the vehicle. The whole thing dragged on for a couple of months after which he put in a claim in the small claims court and was awarded the full garage fee *plus* the hire money for the period he was without his van *plus* an allowance for his time and trouble making the claim. The bill came to many thousands of pounds which the cops had to pay.

The small guy does win sometimes :-)

true,TalesAbound,nottinghamshire,Nottingham/Stafford,"&gt;or perhaps seen the negative effects of drug prohibition in your community? 

This, and a little more.

To begin with, I come from a fairly good school in a fairly affluent and nice area (Not Eton level or anything like that, but good for a publicly funded school). Most of the parents were quite well off and had good educations. You'd expect the kids to be the same - but drugs were really prevalent at my school. Not open, like inner city, but really wide. I had some reasonable beefs with kids who were big users and sometime dealers, and lost my first girlfriend because of it. I've had friends develop addictions to cocaine and all of these formative experiences around drugs made me very suspicious of them as psychoactive. I knew people who became totally different when they got onto a strong habit. I believe that drugs do change people, and that this can be to quite negative ends if it's the wrong person.

I tried to keep my mind open about it, even though I don't think it's for me, but every time I see a pro-drug argument I envision a situation in which the perceived harm I saw as a teenager loses any of the few checks on it, and spreads much further. I recently visited Amsterdam for a short holiday with some friends, some of whom were there for the drugs. I was terrified by the system they have; if you couple that with the lager lout culture of the UK, I think we'd be looking at absolute chaos. All these experiences combined means I don't think that much of the UK is mature enough to handle that kind of an approach to drugs. Therefore, you can see how it's both a personal issue and an issue of social order and public safety to me.

&gt;I believe that drug prohibition is a failure. It's easier for kids (like mine) to get cannabis than it is for them to get tobacco. 

Yeah, that's certainly the case. Alcohol as well. Whilst there's many sound arguments about individual choice and the freedom to put whatever you want into your own body, I think that there should be a limit to this. Kids who get tobacco aren't doing as much short term harm to themselves as they are if they're on mass binges every night or using cocaine or methamphetamines. We can barely regulate alcahol as it is; adding drugs onto that will be like opening a flood gate, I fear. What it comes down to is not trusting any government to handle that in the right way, or for the public to do so either. 

This is coming from a guy in his early twenties who does enjoy a social drink and has even been known to get drunk - I don't think this makes me a hypocrite (or a saddo, as I've been called in the past) because I know there's people who, like me, know where the line is. It's the ones that don't, or don't realise what they're getting into and what the fire they're playing with is. I have alcoholic members of my family - I don't want to push the boat out with that any more than I'd want to push the boat out with drugs after seeing what it did to people I really cared about as a teenager. 

&gt;Cars kill many more people than drugs. But we don't pass laws demanding that cars are banned. Instead we pass laws requiring people to be properly educated in driving, to wear a seat belt and to have proper insurance in case something does go wrong.

Of course, that's a valid point. We're supposed to be doing that with alcohol too though, if memory serves, and it's not being done wonderfully. If we can find a way of making it work that has effects, great, lets legalise and make it work. But I remain sceptical that this can be done. I think that if we were to make legal changes, they would need to be very deliberate and steady ones designed to make sure it's the mature and rational users of drugs who aren't getting arrested, much like we don't arrest decent drivers. I know there's drug users like that.

Very interesting, though.  Thanks for taking the time to write it.  

I actually find myself in agreement with pretty much everything you say.  I think you're probably right that legalisation or de-criminalisation would make things worse in the short term, particularly with an inept government pulling the strings.  I also think it's quite likely that if, say, cannabis ever were legalised then within a year or two the politicians would declare ""we tried that and it didn't work"" and criminalise it again.  Oh wait, this has already happened with cannabis being re-classified as class C and then back to class B... Ho hum.

In reality this would have to be a longer term strategy.  Maybe it would take 5 years, 10 years, or perhaps more until we could hope see a real change in public attitude towards drugs (i.e. greater individual responsibility).  Quite honestly, I'm not sure I can ever see that happening in my lifetime when governments can't think past the 5 year election cycle.  If there were enough outraged Daily Mail readers ready to vote for the party that promised to re-criminalise drugs then you can guarantee that one party or another would step up to the plate.

So yes, it's a tough one.  All I can say for sure is that prohibition isn't working.  But I agree that the alternative may not be any better, at least in the short term.

They know their shit over there.

&gt;No, the deep irony is that mephedrone is actually a dangerous drug - in a quantifiable sense, it produces a long lived metabolite 4-paramethyl-ephedrine which is dangerous to the cadiovascular system.

&gt;It is driving out illegal, safer alternatives which do not produce metabolites like this such as MDMA. Rather sick.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/be7xe/police_are_investigating_the_deaths_of_two_uk/c0mdwvr

Same guy:

&gt;Please be aware that 4-MMC (4-methyl-methcathinone) is a close analog of 4-MMA (4-methyl-methamphetamine), a compound notorious for having one of the best highs ever and then causing permanent personality changes and lasting lack of motivation. The description that comes up again and again from users is a sense of something ""broken"" deep down, and a complete inability to change it back. Methamphetamine is fucking candy compared to it. One of the worst amphetamine analogs ever, and mephedrone is its closest cousin.

&gt;Mephedrone appears to have a similar effect, although it appears to fade over time (6+ months) unlike the permanence of 4-MMA. Be aware that this drug fucks with your brain on a deep level, and is very harmful long term to your reward pathways. You will change your behaviour, isolate yourself without realizing it, and it is very difficult to realize the harm you are doing.

&gt;I've tried pretty much every drug under the sun, and I will never, ever touch mephedrone again. Why? The greatest high you've had for the first few times, then it fades completely to wired confused stimulation. But you keep doing it, and doing it, and doing it, in some misguided attempt that you can get it back. You can't. That part of your brain that created that experience is gone. And you're just going to waste money and time on something that has zero lasting value.

&gt;For the love of christ, if you want to get geeked up and ramble, use coke. If you want to dance and hug, use MDMA. Skip the mephedrone, it's a waste of time.

&gt;It is serious, serious shit and is currently destroying the UK at the moment. You have no idea what you're in for.

You say that like it's a weird thing.

You don't launch new code and THEN test it.  You don't put passengers on an airplane and THEN test it.  And no, I don't expect them to let people inject all manner of unanalyzed substances into their bodies and THEN test for side-effects.

Current regs, mean that even if all three intelligence branches shared a data recovery site, it would have to be staffed with three times the necessary staff for 24/7 uptime, because one member wouldn't necessarily have clearence to access the other branch's server areas.

Part of the ""cloud"" program is to spread those less regulated apps over the different datacentres too, properly utilising the ones that are under long term contracts.

Remember, that a lot of these centres are already built and fully equipped.

They've also done a good job of pointing out key figures - Illegal downloaders actually spend about double the amount of money on music than their 'law-abiding' counterparts.

It's interesting the musicians and music business people's view points they got on that film, let's break it down shall we and consider how much these people are being affected:

+ Louis Walsh... absolutely fucking minted from ripping off child stars.  

+ Feargal Sharkey ( I've worked with this guy and so have a lot of my peers ): Rips off anyone and everyone he comes into contact with. 

+ Platinum selling artist harping on about the large cost of recording a single and how file sharers are taking money out of his hands: Already being taken to the cleaners by his label, so his opinion's null and void as far as I'm concerned. 

+ Rapper guy: Looking to cash in with an angle... a song about piracy ( a hot topic ) will do it. And FTR the mixing desk he's standing in front of is worth about £150,000, so he doesn't appear to be doing too badly. 

+ The Featured Artists Coalition ( Of which I'm a member ) are the only ones making sense here. Embracing the internet, that's the way forward.  

Also the programme states how this ""new law"" will be put into practice like it's already happened. FTR: it ain't law yet, not by a long shot.

&gt; He has implied he objects to the lib-dem pro-immigration policies, this doesn't necassarily imply he thinks immigrants can't contribute, it could simply mean he doesn't think there are sufficient jobs are available to merit more immigration.

Right. There's quite a bit of unemployment in the UK, and immigration makes this situation worse.

There is the other issue that many immigrants to the UK are (or were?) unskilled or semi-skilled labour, when the UK already has a large low-paid working-class population (for whom unemployment is a big issue).

Unlike Canada or Australia, immigrants aren't needed to 'populate the country' either.

I know some would talk about having an ageing population, and the need for 'young blood' to contribute to the pension pot, but better education, not cheap labour, is the way to do that in the 'knowledge economy'. And we could have better education if we had smaller class sizes and fewer non-English-speaking kids coming to school.

&gt; It's no strawman: disagreeing with ""We are committed to... fostering social inclusion and respect for ethnic, cultural and religious diversity."" is racist at worst and incredibly xenophobic at best.

I'd like to see less emphasis on 'diversity' for immigrants, and more on 'integration', as in France and the Netherlands.

Their complaints that I've read are that standards are slipping for passengers and will slip further if they cut staff levels. I think that that's the passenger's problem and they can always just book with a different airline if they don't like the service. Distributing travel and making people not want to book BA again is definitely not in their interests.

""Thank you for contacting me about the Digital Economy Bill.

For nearly twelve years, the Government has neglected this crucial area of our economy. We believe a huge amount needs to be done to give the UK a modern regulatory environment for the digital and creative industries. Whilst we welcome aspects of the bill there are other areas of great concern to us.

We want to make sure that Britain has the most favourable intellectual framework in the world for innovators, digital content creators and high tech businesses. We recognise the need to tackle digital piracy and make it possible for people to buy and sell digital intellectual property online. However, it is vital that any anti-piracy measures promote new business models rather than holding innovation back. This must not be about propping up existing business models but creating an environment that allows new ones to develop. That is why we were opposed to the original clause 17 and are still opposed to clause 29 which props up ITV regional news with BBC Licence Fee payers money.

The Government's failure to introduce the Bill until the eleventh hour of this Parliament has given rise to considerable concern that we no longer have the time to scrutinise the many controversial and detailed measures outlined in their proposals. We fully appreciate these concerns. However in certain areas, including measures to allow website blocking in certain carefully proscribed circumstances, there has been substantial debate in the House of Lords. I also believe they should be debated in the House of Commons before we agree to them. Only if we are confident that they have been given the scrutiny that they deserve will we support them

It is also worth pointing out that many of the fears about the Bill's proposals are not entirely accurate. People won't be disconnected from the internet without due process. And it will only be a small minority of people who consistently infringe copyright who are disconnected, not the average person who happens to have done so once or twice. Even then, they may be able to reconnect using another ISP immediately and without penalty.

Please rest assured that my colleagues in the Shadow Culture, Media and Sport and Shadow Business, Innovation and Skills teams will do everything in their power to work towards legislation that strengthens our digital sector and provides the security that our businesses and consumers so desperately need.

Once again, thank you for taking the time to contact me.

Best wishes

=============================

Dear Peter,

Thank you for contacting me about the Digital Economy Bill.

In November 2009, the Government set out a series of policies relating to Britain's digital sector. I support the ambition of this Bill, but am disappointed that it does not show more imagination. Very few of the proposals contained with Lord Carter's Digital Britain report have made it to the Bill.

The Government has neglected this crucial area of our economy, and my party recognise that legislation is urgently needed to safeguard this vital industry and prevent a slide from our position as a global leader in creative industries.

However, I am concerned that, in places, the Bill proposes old economy solutions to new economy problems. Furthermore, there is a lack of detail on how certain proposals would be implemented - with much still to be done through codes of practice and secondary legislation - and a limited timeframe for the Government to make this legislation law.

I can assure you that my colleagues in the Shadow Business, Innovation and Skills and the Shadow Culture, Media and Sport Teams are following this legislation very closely. They will continue to hold the Government to account on this issue and take every opportunity to ensure that the legislation benefits our economy as much as possible.

I support measures to tackle internet piracy. However, I share your concerns about the practical implications of the Government's proposals. They fail to properly answer some critical questions; for example, what criteria will the Secretary of State use before deciding to cut someone off? They also fail to suggest incentives for technical solutions that prevent or deter people from illegal file-sharing in the first place.

In the Digital Britain Report, the Government announced a universal broadband pledge that would speeds of 2mbps across the country by 2012. My party and I fully support the proposal and the plans to use surplus licence fee money from the Digital Switchover process to fund it.

We are, however, opposed to the unfair and old fashioned telephone tax with which the Government plans to fund next generation broadband. Instead, Conservatives would achieve this by opening up BT's ducts, reforming the business rates system and allowing access to telegraph poles where local authorities give their consent. All of these measures would reduce the cost of rolling out broadband to rural areas and encourage private sector investment

My party and I welcome the moves to put the classification of video games on a statutory basis. This is a necessary measure that will help protect children from accessing inappropriate material. We will work constructively with the Government to create a new robust system. I also believe though that it should have used this opportunity to close a loop hole that currently allows content of a violent and sexual nature in sports and music videos to be sold to children.

As part of the Bill, the Government has set out provisions for a switch from analogue radio to Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB). As the Shadow Secretary for Culture, Jeremy Hunt MP, has stated, Conservatives are 'wholeheartedly behind a digital switchover of the radio industry'. We are not however, convinced that the country will be ready by the Government's planned switchover date of 2015. Not enough has been done to explain the benefits of digital to consumers, millions of analogue radios will have to be thrown away, and hundreds of local radio stations will be put under threat. We will be pushing the Government for clarity of their plans to tackle each of these problems.

One such proposal is the designation of new duties to OFCOM. This Bill would oblige OFCOM to promote investment in infrastructure and content alongside its duties to promote competition, and also to carry out an assessment of the UK's communications infrastructure every two years. These measures are both unnecessary and could end up distorting the market.

Conservatives are opposed to topslicing the licence fee to fund regional news programmes on independent broadcasters as set out in the Digital Britain Report. If there is spare money from the licence fee, then the Government should consider giving the money back to licence fee payers. We support the industry's preference to find commercial solutions, and instead of using the licence fee we have proposed deregulating the regional media sector to allow new, self-financing models to emerge.

Once again, thank you for taking the time to contact me.

&gt;Hi John,
&gt;
&gt;I'm writing to voice my concern over the current state of British Libel Laws, and more specifically the case surrounding Simon Singh's views on Chiropractic treatment.
&gt;
&gt;While I'm not directly part of the scientific community, I do enjoy learning about recent discoveries and understanding how the world around us really works. As you may be aware Simon Singh helps people who fall in to this category, since he has done much popularise science and education in the UK. If you weren't aware of him, then don't worry! In all honesty I didn't know him by name either, until I heard about his court case in 2009. Now that I do know his name, I've begun to notice how much he contributed in making educational shows and articles that are accessible to the masses. He has produced a number of scientifc documentaries, appeared on a number of BBC radio shows, written articles for the Guardian's science column and taken part in a number of lectures and educational events. He is the kind of scientific celebrity that you would not be surprised to appear on the Queen's honors list in 10-20 years.
&gt;
&gt;In 2008 he wrote an article for the Guardian about Chiropractic medicine and the complete lack of evidence that is helps cure conditions. You can find the article here http://layscience.net/node/621 , presumably the original article has been removed from the Guardian's website due to the libel case. In short, Chiropracty is based on the belief that the majority of medical conditions are caused by a ""misalignment of the spine"", and that these conditions can be treated by what is little more than a good back rub with a little snake oil. And when say snake oil I mean just that, there have been no scientific studies to prove Chripractic methods as an effective treatment for ailments that would not be equally relieved by a physiotherapist. I will not argue against its effectiveness as a placebo, but Chripractors charge a lot more than it would cost for your GP to perscribe you a sugar pill. Hell, even Penn and Teller have taken a swing at Chiropracty on their show Bullshit - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqo4KBNL_h4#t=06m06s
&gt;
&gt;Back on topic though, it saddened me to read this article by Simon http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/mar/12/simon-singh-goodbye-libel-reform , that announces his departure from the Guardian. I'm willing to take the announcement with a pinch of salt considering his current investment in to questioning the validity of current libel laws, but this has definitely been an expensive process for Simon (a Guardian article from last year cites the legal costs at over £100k - http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/may/13/simon-singh-british-chiropractic-association ). This is where the case begins to bother me, Simon has to spend money and time defending something he said that the scientific community as a whole considers fact. While I'd hope the law is not so biassed as to allow the Chiropractors to win the case, they must think they at least have a chance (unless they just figured Simon would shrug it off and write an apology) and it has and will continue to take time and money away from somebody who has in my experience only ever had the interests of our nations people in his heart.
&gt;
&gt;So given this context, I'd like to ask a few questions. Firstly, why is the libel law so intrusive of our freedom of speech? Why do such cases require such lengthy and expensive preceedings? Do Labour or yourself consider this an issue that needs to be addressed? (If there is a more appropiate point of contact in your party, can I have their name so I can forward this email to them). And should you already know of any progressive debate regarding this issue, what changes do Labour propose?
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for your time,
&gt;

I'm not religious but I respect other peoples viewpoints, wrong though they may be in my opinion that's life. People hate different people. It's as old as mankind.

In several generations I feel they will be proven wrong, they'll have to do something. Church gatherings are dwindling, popularity fading and people are asking the right questions. They can't just sit and ignore the facts forever.

I agree with things not changing overnight, but at the same time, she should not be in that business if she objects to what may or may not happen behind a closed door.

At the same time, you are right about the church being excused all the time too, they not only get away with intolerance and discrimination, but they are also seemingly allowed to openly preach hate, yet if they were Muslims preaching hate, they would be locked up quicker than shit off a shovel. Yet the catholic and Anglican churches are allowed to say how vile I am and that I should die.

Firstly, if she is allowed to turn the gay couple away then surely everyone that owns a B&amp;B (or any other business) would therefore be allowed to as well. This would be a very dangerous precedent and could lead to mass discrimination against minority groups.  

As the fight for women and black rights (in this country and others) have shown in the past, laws are needed to protect people from discrimination. Imagine the outcry if this same story had been applied to a black couple not being allowed a room because it was ""against her convictions"".  

Freedom of thought and speech is a slightly different issue. She is allowed to say that homosexuality is wrong and declare that the gay couple are immoral but she is not allowed to discriminate against them for that. If her views are that strong then she should not be doing something that would put her at odds with the law.  

Likewise, if I was racist I would be able to express my racist opinions (as Nick Griffin has shown) but to discriminate against people because of their skin colour with actions would quite rightly be illegal.

Dear Mr Neville,
 
Yes, I agree, but the position is not quite as reported and I think that some of the comments on the internet haven't fully understood the procedure at the end of a Parliament. The DEB is a mammoth project containing dozens of different issues, many of them entirely uncontroversial - for example, a harmonisation of the system for age-limit ratings on video games which everyone from consumer agencies to the industry is keen to get. It also contains several very dubious things, including the one you mention and also others. What is going to happen is that anything which the parties think is controversial will get thrown out, and a slimmed-down Bill containing only the things which everyone approves of will go through. There is as I understand it zero risk that the provisions about disconnnecting people for alleged illegal downloads will get through.
 
On the substance of the issue, I'd experct to oppose any such measures. I don't think it's appropriate - if people use the internet illegally they can be prosecuted for that, but not blocked from communication, in the same way as if i used the postal service in some illegal way - I would expect to be fined for doing so, but not that the postman would stop delivery!
 
I'm always pleased to find constituents on email, as it helps keep better in touch. I send updates on current issues from time to time to 3000+ constituents. Would you like to be included?

Yours sincerely

Nick Palmer MP

Subject: Concern about Digital Economy Bill

From:
Daniel Neville

Dear Nick Palmer,

I'm writing to you today because I'm very worried that the Government is 
planning to rush the Digital Economy Bill into law without a full Parliamentary 
debate. 

The law is controversial and contains many measures that concern me. The 
controversial Bill deserves proper scrutiny so please don't let the government 
rush it through. Many people think it will damage schools and businesses as well 
as innocent people who rely on the internet because it will allow the Government 
to disconnect people it suspects of copyright infringement. 

Industry experts, internet service providers (like Talk Talk and BT) and huge 
internet companies like Google and Yahoo are all opposing the bill - yet the 
Government seems intent on forcing it through without a real debate. 

As a constituent I am writing to you today to ask you to do all you can to 
ensure the Government doesn't just rush the bill through and deny us our 
democratic right to scrutiny and debate.

Daniel Neville.

That's news to me- particularly if he took British nationality, which I presume he must have done if he was representing GB as an athlete. It also surprises me that the offences of which he was convicted- driving while disqualified and careless driving- would be considered serious enough to merit this treatment. I knew that some crimes could result in deportation following completion of the sentence, however I thought that was mainly reserved for crimes involving violence or intimidation.

edit: There's another article [here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/jan/11/immigration-deportation-paralympics) from the Guardian from January 2009 which is very similar to the Independent's article, however it does throw some light on his nationality status.

As you mention, there's a really nice console room in use for one season (14). [This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1NqLaxZqN0) is a rather spot-on CG render of it.

The enigma of this console room, which the Doctor does say goes unused and gives the impression it exists simultaneously with the regular one, is its door appears to lead directly outside just like the other console room.

Well I guess you are assuming that this document was drafted up by a party figure head, but at the present it was drafted in a largely democratic (and unorganised) manner. So I doubt that finding these details has any indication on the authors intellectual authority, and may in fact be an artefact of the mass collaboration.

Secondly, the original draft of copyright in the UK (which was aimed at protecting artists) was set at 14 years. It has only been through the continual lobbying by distribution monopolies over time that has managed to stretch that out of all recognition. Also you must recognise that in the past after a piece of music or artwork was produced there was a long distribution chain that had to be absorbed in the copyright time. However, with today's digital distribution, such lengths may not be necessary.

Now, I am not going to pretend that I have any stats on how many artists are struggling to make a living or are snorting cocaine from the backs of strippers, but I suspect neither do you...

But these issues have been put out to be refined, and I would argue that as long as the intention is clear, and there is a diverse enough base of members such that the process can duly reflect the views of the party. Then I believe that some ideas being solidified in text, can serve to get people mobilised and engaged in a more fruitful discussion than a smaller group of members can possibly achieve. (As I think we are demonstrating now, as I assume neither of us were involved in the formation of the manifesto)

However, so not to be guilty of just starting a pointless back and forth of snide remarks and views on the same issue, I thought I would point out some of the things that I noticed that may be unworkable.

&gt; a new right to pay only for the fraction of the claimed broadband speed that the provider actually delivers, so if you sign up for an 8Mb/s connection and only receive 2Mb/s

This is definitely not possible, this implies that it is even possible to supply 2Mb/s broadband at 1/4 the price of 8Mb/s service. However, as these rates are usually determined by many factors such as line noise, exchange distance and load, then it is unfeasible to expect every communication company to implement this. A simpler solution may be that you pay the lowest applicable fee by that provider for the level of service you are receiving, monitored on a monthly basis (so if you pay for 12Mbs and only get 6Mbs and the 8Mbs plan is the lowest offered, you can pay at this rate). Although obviously care needs to be taken in extreme cases were the service blatantly flaunts these rules.

&gt; We believe that MPs must be held to a higher standard of accountability than unelected citizens. To prevent abuses of their position, such as the redaction of expenses information, their right to privacy will be secondary to the public right to hold them to account for their actions.

This scares me some what, while I believe that MPs should be fully accountable for their actions, I also believe that being an MP should be as a service to your fellow man, and that your human right to privacy should not be sacrificed for this public service.

However, some policies that I had not expected to see and which I greatly welcome:

&gt; new right for photographers and filmmakers to go about their business without persecution under anti-terror laws

&gt; We will give the public a new right to encrypt their private data

Do I think these rules will make the UK more susceptible to terrorist acts, definitely not, but I do think the benefits will be felt in easing the tensions felt in public under these crazy terrorism masks.

They had a real opportunity to present themselves as a pragmatic party championing the completely un-politicised cause of terrible libel laws and crappy distribution mechanisms...instead they've released something half-consisting of stuff you'd expect from a hippie party in the 60s :-/

Example: Drug Patents. Outright abolishing them and replacing them with subsidies is sheer idiocy... it would have to be an International thing for a start, and the costs of administrating the subsidies such that those companies which created 'worthwhile' drugs were rewarded with subsidies  would be far more expensive than if we just gave the money to drugs companies to donate drugs to less developed countries. You can't just abandon free market mechanics, replace it with some kind of centrally administrated subsidy system and expect these companies to somehow efficiently develop drugs based on handouts.

If we want to cry over poorer countries being unable to purchase expensive drugs then just BUY the drugs for the countries and distribute them in a way which minimises corruption- increased demand for the drugs actually pushes the costs down because they charge less per unit to recoup the costs of development.

Intellectual Property is one of the cornerstones of our civilisation imo, and the big problem we're having in modern times is that media companies aren't prepared to *distribute* their media in a fair and reasonable way. Stripping their rights to own and charge a fair price for their product isn't going to solve it. Their other ideas involving restricting DRM are much more sensible.

And their policy on the BBC is also madness- other than the DRM.

This is a MUCH wider issue than just BA staff. See: http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/mar/17/ba-strike-plan-gregor-gall

&gt;Yes, BA will lose £100m in the strike, but the prize for it is much bigger. That prize is the decimation of Unite as a serious force in BA.

&gt;With Unite put in its place, BA will be able to instruct its cabin crew to do exactly as its wants.

The fact is the union has been driven in to this situation (it's not often you get 80%+ balloting for strike action).

BA has already implemented huge attacks on the work force, which they accepted as neccessary; but it also has gone back on prior agreements:

&gt;British Airways workers have been through a lot. The cabin crew now threatening to take strike action had already accepted severe conditions back in June, to save the company from what they were assured would be ruin. Thousands took leave without pay, worked part-time or worked unpaid. There were 2,500 job cuts, capacity reductions and a pay deal with pilots to reduce costs. As a result, the company accumulated a war chest of £2bn. No one can say that the workers are not open to negotiation. And the union leadership has gone to considerable lengths to avoid a strike, offering cost-cutting agreements that would save BA £140m. However, evidently in a confident mood, BA boss Willie Walsh took the June agreements as his cue to prepare the most appalling jobs massacre, without negotiation with the unions. It is an attempt to break the union far more than it is an attempt to save money. So, the BA workers' reaction to this vote is no more surprising than is Willie Walsh's attempt to bully the workers through litigation. - http://leninology.blogspot.com/2009/12/british-airways-strikers.html

The Independant points out BA is in a much better situation than it was at any rate, making rhetoric about imminent collapse look rather silly:

&gt;BA dropped £124m into the red this summer, its first ever high-season loss, and ended last year with a shocking £400m loss, compared with record £922m profits the year before. That said, the company is in a better position than it was. It has amassed a £2bn cash pile, helped by last month's £300m convertible bond. And it is cutting costs with a vengeance: carving out 6.6 per cent so far this year thanks to 2,500 job cuts, capacity reductions and a pay deal with pilots and engineers. - http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/willie-walsh-i-didnt-set-out-to-be-ceo-but-i-love-every-minute-of-it-1777718.html

The Union said they would accept a 2% pay cut from BA, and that's on top of the concessions I quote above. BA has driven the Union here, the workers are clearly open to negotiation. It's pushing for the long-term gain it will get from smashing Unite (and do I need to go in to the repercussions this will have across the unionised workforce?). In light of all this I find it particularly horrific that the media has spread so much shit about the striking workers and even Labour, the party funded by Unite, has gone out of it's way to criticise them. It's a classic Catch 22: Accept being trodden on for years to come, or risk the stability of your employer. Ultimately, if they don't strike now working for BA might become worse than being unemployed.

&gt;Being profitable allows it to expand, employing more people.

This is true, but part of the reasoning behind the strike is BA's wish to put new employees on separate flights to existing employees. This will essentially segregate the up-and-coming workforce. New workers will be unlikely to be unionised (and will have no idea about the working conditions they could have). The Union can strike now to prevent this, or face a slow decline.",0,1269537864,null,0,true,0,c0mvqgi,t3_bi0qp,t1_c0mvqgi,t1_c0mvpc8,null,1426253869,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I think our current banking sector driven crisis begs to differ, as does the rise of China as a major power (driven by an industrial base may I add).

There is certainly something to be said for a balance here, but industries could've been made competitive instead of throwing thousands into the dole que

&gt;Acting in the best interests of its members in the long term does NOT necessarily equate with doing as the majority of voters wish in a snap poll

anti-union laws already prevent such a thing. Ballots have to be done by post, from the safety and isolation of ones own home. There is nothing 'snap' about it. Your argument sounds inherently undemocratic. Why don't we just hand power to a benevolent dictator instead of having 'snap' polls every four years? Maybe such a dictator would act in our long term best interests? (he/she would at least claim to!). Such things reek of Stalinism

Oh no, an incident which will serve as a reference point for the healthy regulation of financial services, boo hoo. Wouldn't you just *love* to see the fallout of a similarly-sized slump in the manufacturing industry? Oh wait, that would've happened years ago, had we propped it up and allowed it to continue stagnating.


&gt;as does the rise of China as a major power (driven by an industrial base may I add)


If you believe that Britain could *ever* compete with China on the basis of sheer manufacturing industrial scale then you are a rather deluded, if not deranged, individual. I love how you see the rise of China as some kind of failure on our part, how cute.


&gt;The very idea that economies are better off supplying elusive services as opposed to creating tangible goods is a rather silly one


Specialisation, specialisation, specialisation. The rather primitive mindset of people continuing to solely equate manufacturing growth with a healthy economy is utterly stupefying. Please read my post, if it's not too much *effort* for you.
