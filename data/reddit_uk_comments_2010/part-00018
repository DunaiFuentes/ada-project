I've always assumed that Rory, for instance, wouldn't have forgotten the Cybermen or Daleks, etc. What also made her unique, though, is the fact that it was her memories that were used by the Alliance to create the ""fake world"" in the *Pandorica Opens* episode. This gave her the power to bring back Rory as a Centurion. A similar power later allowed her to bring back both her parents and the Doctor himself.

I'm hoping this is all cleared up in the Christmas special. Did the Russell T. Davies world/universe never happen? Has it simply been forgotten? Was it forgotten for all of series five but now everything is back to normal?

I don't want to just disagree with you, as I'm not sure that would accomplish anything. But I do want to make a few points and see what you think of them.

The budget for season five was cut. This naturally results in an Earth-centric season. It's rather unfortunate, but it's not unheard of in Doctor Who history. See most of Jon Pertwee's tenure. What I think is more important is the way the writers handle it.

Which brings me to my next point, that creativity thing. I think anything can be reduced to its basic points and made to seem boring if you want it to be. The devil is in the details, as they say. I do admit that the recent Who (since the revitalization) has been rather action/adventure-oriented. I don't personally mind this. It's different, but it's not bad. And it's fun.

Also, you have to remember that Who is not hard sci-fi. It has always been rather soft sci-fi. But that's hardly a good point at all, just something to keep in mind.

But one thing I do have to just blatantly disagree with you on is the sonic screwdriver comment. Oh, I agree it was used far more often than in the previous seasons. But I also don't give a rat's ass. It doesn't harm the series at all to use the sonic screwdriver more often. It's a nice little utility that speeds up storytelling because it embodies our suspension of disbelief. The screwdriver opens doors? Well, okay. The screwdriver hacks into computers? Okay. The screwdriver can't do wood? Okay. If it weren't for the screwdriver, we'd just have some *other* device that the Doctor would have to whip out to accomplish the same exact task.

true,winterorange,null,null,"I did this a few years ago...moved back from Japan, had nothing to do...so on a whim I downloaded The Daleks (from the original very first season) and thats all it took for me...I was hooked! Spent the next 2 years downloading them from the Dr.Who Usenet group. So that's one place I can recommend you check out  if you are truly interested in watching it all in order and getting all those stories that weren't later released on DVD, etc. I don't regret the time spent watching the original 26 or whatever seasons (I take that back...there were a few stories from the 5th and 7th Doctors that i found excruciatingly painful to get through.) Other than those it was a wonderful experience and even though I'm not much a fan of the new material, I can still appreciate it knowing the grand epic history of the Doctor. For instance, unless you've seen all the previous Dalek storylines (e.g. Genesis of the Daleks, etc), you can't really fully understand why the Doctor gets so freaked out and intense when confronted again by the Daleks in the new series. It just has so much more weight when you know the long history between the two. Same goes for the Master and Cybermen material. I think any fan of the new stuff would get even more out of it if they just took the time and effort to check out the older material. 

Good luck finding it! You won't regret it (even if you just start at the 3rd Doctor, although I recommend also watching the final storyline of the 2nd Doctor, the epic 10 part 'War Games' to learn how and why he was banished to Earth, and also to get a taste of the under appreciated Patrick Troughton years.

Towards the end of the night they played ""This is Gallifrey..."" which showed each Doctor's regeneration, and people started applauding to each one which kind of got in the way of the music, but it was still fun.

A lot of people initially thought Matt Smith wouldn't be there because he had this thing going on on the screens - but then he climbed a ladder and appeared within the continuity of what had been going on.

Karen Gillan could have done better with her presenting, but I can't complain. The whole evening was brilliant, and the music so much fun to listen to.

I'll upload some photos soon.

EDIT: forgot to mention. It was really cute when the white Dalek was on stage, a little kid sitting in the audience (and probably many more that I didn't notice) kept pointing his sonic screwdriver at it hoping to disable it :)

EDIT 2: I could karma whore in a separate post but I'll post them here instead. Also, I kept my flash off the whole time so as not to piss off the musicians/actors/etc, so forgive any shakiness...

The budget was cut: I don't see this as an excuse really. Consider that the budget for the classic who was really small, and had no access to CGI. It was certainly smaller (comparatively) than the new who budget. They still made alien worlds. Pertwee is a good point, but his stories were longer and much more interesting. His stories used earth to show alien worlds, as in colony in space, etc. I don't see cutting the budget as a good justification for earth based stories. 

I'd like to really thank you for using the term ""action/adventure"" stories as that rather well encapsulates how i think of new who, but have never come up with a good descriptor. I certainly agree with the soft sci, but I consider ""doctor-dobby"" and 11 coming back through amy's memories to be too far from sci fi for my liking. That is purely personal preference.

As for the screwdriver, I have said in other threads that I think using the screwdriver to speed up the storytelling just shows poor storytelling. In the Silurian Episode, he uses the screwdriver to neutralize the enemies weapons. I can't think of a single classic who instance where this was done (feel free to provide one if one exists). I feel it is used too much for too many purposes, which demonstrates uncreative storytelling. As you say, some other device could have been used if not the screwdriver. I say - tell the story differently. 

I would also just like to add, for the sake of honesty, that in my heart I wanted the new series of Who to be an exact continuation of the classic series. I understand that due to current TV trends and show formats that this isn't possible, but I think the creativity of classic Who has really been lost in a mire of too much physical emotion (Rose, Martha, etc), to many ""the bad guy was just created lets deal with it"" episodes, and very few episodes that make me think, very few episodes that I have any desire to rewatch.

Most of them looking quite similar from every other one. I think a joke often recited was that the Who crew used the same quarry over and over for countless planets.

&gt;Pertwee is a good point, but his stories were longer and much more interesting.

In their own way, certainly. The format was much different back then. It allowed for long story arcs that encompassed entire seasons with a To Be Continued... after nearly every episode. I wouldn't say it's necessarily a bad thing. Merely different. Oh well.

&gt;That is purely personal preference.

Understandable. I think the Doctor-Dobby (which is an awesome descriptor, thank you for *that* one) could have done with a bit more explanation. I think that entire season finale suffered from a lack of exposition. It was fun, certainly, but I've never thought of RTD as a particularly good writer. And even aside from the ridiculousness of the Doctor shrinking into Gollum after being aged a hundred years forcibly, it simply suffered 'cause RTD didn't stress the points of the plot which *could* have saved it.

Those points being the fine-points of the Archangel Network, how it interacts with the populace, the power of a psychic network (beyond simply being a very large hypnotic device), the power of psychic energy itself, and the ability of an individual to sync up with the network and use the power available if they had the conscious desire. Each of those points received barely a sentence of dialogue. Which made the solution just seem rather silly. RTD topped a silly looking Doctor with a silly looking floating Doctor.

&gt;I say - tell the story differently.

I understand that. I disagree wholeheartedly, though. I think it's such a minor aspect of storytelling that it doesn't matter. Speeding that aspect of the storytelling up merely frees the writers up to focus on other aspects and elaborate on them. And I certainly believe that the new series has been focused much more on emotions than the early series.

&gt;I think the creativity of classic Who has really been lost in a mire of too much physical emotion

I'm curious as to what you mean by physical emotion. Certainly there was a physical aspect that explained Rose and Martha's feelings for the Doctor, but I don't think that has much to do with it. Most of what the writers attempted to focus on were the emotions (and in the best episodes, Martha and Rose were both just Companions rather than people who loved the Doctor - excluding ""Human Nature""/""Family of Blood"" - but that in itself is quite telling of the fact that the writers should move away from the Doctor being involved in romance; which I think has actually happened quite neatly with Amy).

I believe earlier you put Amy in the same group as Rose and Martha by saying ""lusting/loving"" the Doctor. I'm not quite certain that's fair. We get one episode where Amy wants to jump the Doctor's bones, and the Doctor himself said in the following episode, ""[to Rory] It would have been you. It *should* have been you!"" And that little niggling feeling that Amy has feelings for the Doctor is quite quashed by the end of ""Amy's Choice,"" which was a brilliant episode, in my opinion, due to the Dream Lord and the revelations about the Doctor's own mind (something we get so few peeks into) and sentiments towards himself.

&gt;to many ""the bad guy was just created lets deal with it"" episodes,

I actually agree with you here. Something RTD's tenure was lacking heavily was original monsters that could or would actually be *enemies* for the Doctor rather than just another monster the Doctor has to figure out and beat. The one *enemy* that I can think of during RTD's tenure that was a *new* enemy was Cassandra. And that's telling of the creativity of RTD's tenure on its own.

I believe Moffat has proven himself capable of creating actual *enemies* as we see in the Weeping Angels. He creates them, and then when given time to elaborate on them he actually makes them into proper *monsters.* Maybe I have too much faith in Moffat, but I certainly believe he can create enemies rather than just episode-limited bad guys.

&gt;and very few episodes that make me think

Personally, I don't go to Doctor Who to think. ;)

&gt;very few episodes that I have any desire to rewatch.

I find this true of both the original run *and* the revitalization. I can name every episode of the revitalization right now that I would care to rewatch.

Yes, it was a running joke that they used a quarry - but in doing so they had to write the story in such a way as to include non-earth elements. The stories FELT like they were on another planet, and that was the magic.

I think we can just agree to disagree on the points you made with the example of the Archangel Network - while you wished for more explanation, I wish I could unsee the entire concept!

Physical emotion: This is a major problem for me. In the classic series, the only real physical emotion between a doctor and a companion was with Tom Baker and Sarah Jane - and it was unrequited. With Rose it was obvious, and often distracting as we had to listen to her ask ""are you ok"" 10 thousand times. Martha again, obviously in love with the Doctor, and very annoying. 

Lets say that it was new and different and maybe even creative for the writers to show Rose being obviously in love with the Doctor - I could say 'well, I hated it, but they tried something new, kudos.' However, we get to Martha and I have to put up with it all over again - distracting. 

Now - I get a season respite with Donna, who thankfully does not care about him phyiscally at all - YAY! I think most of the season sucked, but for different reasons. Now - cue Amy. Was it really necessary to:
1. Yank her off the day before her wedding? 

2. Write her character to have been engaged at all?

3. Cause purposeful tension between the doctor and the fiance?

4. Have an episode where Amy tries to jump him? then have the next episode where he takes the couple on a trip to try and make sure she knows who the true love interest in her life is??

Why do I have to deal with this stuff again? It's a sci fi show, not a wednesday evening drama. I don't want to see this nonsense in Doctor Who. It wasn't just companions either - Astrid, the theif chick, River...

Ok, I'm with you on Moffat creating good monsters, such as angels, vashta neradi, etc. Instead of RTD's tenure lacking in original monsters, he took classic ones and made mockeries of them! See cybermen (""delete delete""), overused and neutered daleks, WTF sontarans?

I rewatch the classic series episodes constantly, and from all the seasons. There are so many I find enjoyable. If it gives a little insight to my New Who feelings, I'll list the episodes I do rewatch!

&gt;sufficiently hide one's identity in public

Oh, it gets MUCH worse than that.

I often see pictures of women wearing burquas walking together.

Now replace the women with 6 armed 240 pound men, with thin riot-gear on, neck shields, bullet proof armour, various stun grenades, and balaclava's... covered by a burqua.

I see a security problem there.

A burqa doesn't just cover the face, it covers the BODY.

Imagine the 6 of them walking into a betting shop. They start shooting up the place, and then strip the burqua's off, they're now very mobile, have good vision, still disguised with the balaclavas, weapons on show to intimidate, the money bags they were carrying just un-hook from the neck ties they have on.
A radio - also under the burqua is used to signal the escape vehicle. They pull up, the guys in the riot gear run into the van, throwing stun grenades behind them. Once in the van, they change clothes, remove the balaclavas, and head for another part of town, they swap cars a couple of times, away from security cameras, and are away free.

Damn burquas give an overwhelming advantage in covering up protective gear, assault gear, and whatever equipment you may need until you're in position.

true,Ochobobo,tennant,Tennant,"I *just now* had a dream that I was in the middle of World War II, hiding out with these two guys that were fighting against Nazis. We were surveying the front of some house to see if there were any inside, then one of the Nazi fighters walked around back to check from there.

Now it should be mentioned that these two Nazi fighters, who I'm sure meant very well, were extremely paranoid and apparently suspected everyone of being a Nazi. Because the one in front of the house with me suddenly attacked me, saying he knew I was a Nazi. I pulled out a knife I had and stabbed him multiple times. I subdued him, and then discovered something startling. This guy was not normal at all. He had to be a mutant or an alien. Underneath his human flesh, I didn't find weird green martian flesh or silvery robotics, instead I found clothes. No vital organs, just human clothes. It was very strange.

At that moment the guy that walked around back was coming around front again. Not wanting to be seen next to his dead colleague, I quickly ran around back of the house saying ""There's one chasing me!"" I hoped he would immediately go search around for whatever Nazi was chasing me.

I was sure he would immediately see that his friend was dead and immediately start chasing me instead, so I hopped over a fence in the backyard. For a split second as I hopped over the fence I saw something familiar a few fences away. Something... *blue*.

I continued running as fast as I could, hoping the weird clothes-monster wasn't far behind. I hopped over about three more fences and finally saw it up close... the TARDIS.

""DOCTOR!"" I instinctively shouted. I saw some people standing next to the TARDIS, talking, who immediately turned towards me as I shouted. I recognized them as the Eleventh Doctor... *and* the Tenth Doctor... and Rose. ""DOCTOR...S."" I shouted again. The two Doctors looked mildly surprised.

""Someone's chasing me!"" I said quickly and instinctively ran inside the threshold of the TARDIS, where I would be safe. ""Someone's... oh I can't believe I'm seeing you. You two are brilliant!"" I shook hands with Eleven, who grinned smugly, and with Ten, who looked slightly confused. ""Alright, alright, calm down,"" he said, ""*Who's* chasing you?""

""These...guys. They're fighting... Oh, I can't believe it. You're the Doctors AND Rose!"" Rose smiled at me, and the two Doctors looked, if possible, even more confused.

""How is it these people seem to know everything about us?!"" Ten asked no one in particular. At this, I guessed more fans of the show had seen the Doctors before. And apparently my dreams aren't allowed to break the fourth wall, because I woke up immediately after that.

If the Dream Lord *did* allow me to go on an adventure with them, my guess would be the clothes monsters were some form of golem creature, programmed to fight the Nazis.

It seems many of the issues you have with the emotional aspect of the show really doesn't have much of a reasoning behind it. That's fine. It annoys you. I really don't have much to say on that respect. Is any of the things you mentioned concerning Amy strictly *necessary?* Perhaps not in the grand scheme of things, but for the story that the writers wanted to tell, most assuredly.

Then again, is *any* plot point in *any* story strictly *necessary?* Not likely.

&gt;It's a sci fi show, not a wednesday evening drama.

It is, however, a show that tries to have dynamic characters rather than static ones used simply as plot devices.

But setting that aside as there's not much I can say on that respect, haha.

How in the hell did I forget about ""The Impossible Planet""/""The Satan Pit""? While it may not be the best of episodes, it was certainly good enough to warrant me rewatching it.

""The Empty Child""/""The Doctor Dances"" isn't really up there for an episode that I'd care to rewatch. It suffered from just a blandness that I think Eccleston's tenure was sadly hurt by. It was simply the incredibly low production value of the season that hurt it. But I do admit that it was a pretty interesting concept and it introduced Jack into the mix, which was fun.

The last 10 minutes of Utopia were awesome just 'cause of the Master. No matter how much I liked John Simm, I think Derek Jacobi played the Master infinitely better. He was just *evil* whereas the Simm was just *insane.* I certainly wish they would have kept Jacobi as the Master. It would have been an interesting contrast to see an older Master and a younger Doctor facing off.

Ah well.

""Turn Left"" was one of those episodes that I'm kind of on the fence about. I'm not annoyed by the obvious paradox of a causeless effect, though I know that some people probably would be (just as some people could be annoyed by the tautological paradoxes in season 5's finale). The acting was actually really good. And it is really cool to see how the Earth would fare without the Doctor in just one year.

Not sure what you mean here, maybe you could give some more detail.

&gt;They talk about domestic violence and child abuse as though they were male only problems, when in reality women are at least equally culpable.

You are so wrong there that it's not even funny. And unlike you, I have some evidence to back up my assertions. On domestic violence: [Research on Domestic Violence in the 1990s](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119036214/HTMLSTART)

&gt;The most longstanding and acrimonious debate in the family literature involves the issue of gender symmetry of partner violence (Archer, 2000; Dobash &amp; Dobash, 1992; Dobash, Dobash, Wilson, &amp; Daly, 1992; Johnson, 1995; Kurz, 1989, 1993; Straus, 1990a, 1993). Although papers continue to appear regularly that claim to demonstrate that women are as violent as men in intimate relationships of one kind or another, or in one country or another, a careful assessment of the literature and a look at the few studies that do distinguish among types of violence both indicate that IT is almost entirely a male pattern (97% male in Johnson, 2000a). The evidence seems to indicate that VR is primarily perpetrated by women (Browne, Williams, et al., 1999; Cascardi &amp; Vivian, 1995; Dobash &amp; Dobash, 1992; Johnson, 2000a; Ogle, Maier-Katkin, &amp; Bernard, 1995; Saunders, 1988). CCV appears to be roughly gender symmetric (56% male perpetrators in Johnson, 2000a; see also Milardo, 1998).

&gt;Most studies define gender symmetry in terms of the percent of men and women who have per- petrated at least one act of violence in their relationship. To call this gender symmetry, however, is to ignore different male and female frequencies of violence and the different physical consequences of male-to-female and female-to-male vi- olence. As for the former, Johnson (1999) showed that in 31% of the relationships involving ‘‘mutual’’ CCV, the husbands were clearly more frequently violent than were their wives, compared with 8% in which the wives were more frequently violent. With regard to injury, the more serious physical consequences of male-to-female violence are well-established (Brush, 1990; Sorenson, Up- church, &amp; Shen, 1996; Straus, 1990a, 1999; Tja- den &amp; Thoennes, 1999).

And on child abuse: [Female perpetrators of child sexual abuse: A review of the clinical and empirical literature](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VH7-3V545HD-7&amp;_user=809099&amp;_coverDate=05%2F31%2F1999&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1411160301&amp;_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&amp;_acct=C000043939&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=809099&amp;md5=daef60ad5a530547c56c448cc0b4d9f8)

&gt; While it is certainly conceivable that female-perpetrated victimization, like its male counterpart, may occur more frequently than indicated by available statistics, the bulk of existing data strongly suggests that females are responsible for a relatively small number of sexual offenses against children in the general population, and that men still constitute the vast majority of sexual abuse perpetrators

Your final paragraph is fairly nebulous:

&gt;They present themselves as ultra left wingers who believe in sexual liberation and rehabilitiation over punishment. When really they extend these values only to women. They do everything possible to associate male sexuality with rape, sexual harassment and objectification.

any serious study done in this area as well as the census data all suggest that the wage gap is a product of socially acceptable factors. You can not presume it to be about discrimination.

We've known this since the 70's , it's just the feminists who can;t seem to parse the concept.

Similarly, in the context of DV, the center for disease control places women as the main perpetrators.

no, it's very concise and if you can't even concede that these are massive double standards and that they are the the status quo amongst feminists you must be suffering from a severe case of wilfull ignorance.

Channel 4 has done some amazing stuff and I just love their support for film production and I guess it is often a race between Ch 4 and BBC 2.

The problem is that game/talent/reality shows can be very cheap. Some can be good, say ""QI"" but that is all. Most talent and 'reality' shows though are terrible and seem to be a modernised version of the Roman Colosseum. At the same time, there are ""notable"" exceptions.

* DW Series 4
* DW Music of the Spheres Mini Episode

* TW Children of Earth
* DW The Water of Mars
* DW The End of Time
* DW Series 5

That being said, I have had a hard time getting through Season 2 of Torchwood. I decided to watch Children of Earth before finishing Torchwood Season 2, there are a few spoilers with the cast but I believe it is well worth it. CoE is by far my favorite Torchwood ""episode"". I am currently on Day 4 and can't wait to get home from work to finish up Day 5. I really think CoE is a great place to start Torchwood because of all the action, drama, and suspense that is built in it. The only down side is BIG spoilers with the cast ""changes"".

6pm a policeman turns up at the door and says theres been an alegation (I've been sleeping on the couch for a week at this point waiting for them to move out) I'm told not to have any contact with them WTF?

day 14/15 - the ex turns up to remove all her stuff and I have to get my parents to be around to act as witnesses (she also steals my file server but i didnt notice at the time)

day 30 - still no idea whats going on

2 months - the police come back and arrest me in my own house and turn the mess that the ex left upside down 

I THEN find out that I'm being arrested for the rape of a child under 16 years old and they they are looking for used condoms (more on this later)

the police were nice enough that I could wear clothes with no laces and stuff like that so that I wouldnt have to get undressed if I ended up in the cells (anti-suicide stuff) and took me off to the station

when I got to the station I finally found out exactly what I was accused of. My solicitor told me I was accused of raping my partners 14 year old daughter **6 months earlier**. My partner had said she'd seen a used condom on the bedroom floor (hence the police taking my house apart looking for a non existent 6 month old used condom). During the time together I discovered that my partner was an ex drug addict and the 3 kids I was looking after werent the only ones. 1 was taken away, 1 was given away, 1 was miscarried and I was looking after the latest 3 while she played bingo all the fucking time.

3 months - I'm on police bail for a month.. come back to the station on 22nd December (that was a fucking cool xmas I can tell you).. just to be told... bailed again for a month (i.e. go away for a month)

4 months... I turn up at the police station (wearing slip-on shoes and stuff like that so I dont have to strip if I end up in the cells) to be told ""theres no case to answer.. but it'll remain on file""

I also take issue with the phrase that the article uses of ""time turning into another space dimension"".  That is sooooooo not the way it works.  Time *is* another space dimension.  It is a space dimension in which we are, for some reason currently unknown but widely believed to be related to Entropy, we can only move one direction in.  It is this kind of editorial writing that really annoys me in science articles.

Along with the idea that seems so crazy in the article is that acceleration in space does indeed ""slow down"" time anyway.  We collide particles every day that are only able to be alive for so long because we are accelerating them so fast.  An easy way to think of it is that you may only be allowed to have so much energy.  If all of your energy is in space movement (such as in the case of a photon) then no energy can be spared to move through the time dimension (photons have no half-life to our knowledge).

The point is, given the expansion of space from the big bang with an initial amount of kinetic energy, gravity should slowly reduce the rate of expansion over time.  The further away something is, the slower it should appear to be moving away from us.  But when this theory was tested we discovered that in fact the further away from us something is, the faster it is moving away, on average.  Thus the indication of a ""dark energy"", that we can't account for, that not only added to the initial energy of the universe, but which is actively feeding it to expand faster and faster.

The theory here is that dark energy does not exist, and that distant objects only *appear* to be moving ever-faster because time as been slowing down.

All the time we stereotype rapists as some sort of power-obsessed cartoon character who have no sexual feelings and simply use their penises to oppress women, and rape as something that springs on you out of darkened alleys and on street corners, we're actively misleading women (and men) about the real likelihoods and dangers.

How about we give this tired - and comprehensively disproven - old meme a rest, and acknowledge that the real reason many rapists rape women is because they're horny, frustrated and see the (often drunk, defenceless) women as an easy target.

Rapists are scum, and this doesn't excuse them at all, but *pragmatically* you can massively reduce your chances of being raped simply by not getting *falling-down-and-passing-out* drunk when you're out on your own in public, or not passing out on someone else's bed at a party, or sticking with your friends and having them look out for you when you don't know and trust all the people you're drinking and partying with.

I'm gonna take a shit-load of flak for this, but this *is* a valid criticism *sometimes*.

If I walk through the most dangerous part of town at 3am talking loudly on a phone then I *am* at fault if I get robbed. I put myself in a dangerous position that could have been easily avoided.

With rape, a lot of women also put themselves in similarly dangerous positions. Being so drunk as to not know what you are doing then going to a ""party"" on your own with a bunch of men you just met. What I'm saying may not be popular opinion, but it's true. Perhaps ""blame"" is the wrong word, but ""at fault"" definitely applies. None of this ""justifies"" the attack but that's not the point as the ad is not appealing to rapists directly. It's probably something that should never, ever be mentioned to a victim (what's the point?) but if we are to tackle these social issues then we need to be pragmatic and be able to talk frankly about the situations that lead to sexual violence. 

Here in Glasgow there was a spate of male rapes a few years ago. Anyone who walked through Kelvingrove Park alone at night was being similarly risky. The police warned the public and many people managed to avoid being attacked by taking basic precautions. My disappointment at this advert is that the money would be better spent on these rape prevention strategies rather than some abstract like ""awareness"". This is the Public Awareness Advert equivalent of praying. You feel as if you are doing something but there is no real gain for anyone involved. 

Another point of the ad (my friends and I discussed it at length last week) is to get away from the idea that any woman who has made an effort to dress up is not ""on the pull"". This point is subtle, it's the implication of the ""asking for it"" phrase as ""it"" is not defined. It's not just the threat of violence that needs to change, but the attitude that even harassing a woman based on this assumption is not acceptable. There is a gender disparity here; many if not most single men are always ""on the pull"" and they project this status on everyone else when it's not the case. Again, this point could have been made far better.

A Levels didn't do much better. At Degree level though, it's a huge jump in learning to research and analyse what we've found.

Fractional bandwidth selling like this can work quite well at the macro level (for example selling trans-atlantic/international bandwidth) beause stable usage patterns become visible very quickly when there are tens of thousands of customers using a single pipe. When there are a few dozen houses, it becomes harder to model and you end up with piss-poor performance at peak times - all it takes are a few people streaming HD TV over iPlayer to bork up the entire street. People often don't realise that if every house tried to max. out their domestic broadband connection at the same time, first it would overload the London Internet Exchange, but then overload the total external bandwidth capacity of the entire country.

The solution is neither cheap or simple. At the software level, you can could change the level-2 protocol that Broadband is delivered over; at the moment we use the vernable ATM cell protocol which could be replaced by IP over Ethernet which (I am told) has performance benefits over longer distances from the exchange/router.

Physically, you would have to start replacing the decades old copper-pair PSTN with single-mode optical fibre, starting at the exchange then getting closer and closer to the customer's site with interating projects. Freeing up BT's underground ducts I think would be the easiest way to go about doing this.

1. Memorisation of raw facts is the absolute lowest level of knowledge.
 
2. Application of memorised techniques is next.

3. Understanding problems and choosing from memorised techniques to apply is higher again. I.E. can you see how to build a model around a physics scenario and then use mathematical techniques to solve that model.

4. Systems for deriving and devising new techniques and knowledge is higher again.

5. Processes for choosing between different philosophies on knowledge is highest of all. i.e. can you understand the benefits and drawbacks of formal methods to empirical study. Do you know when to choose evidence and when to choose logic.

As it stands schools do a lot of 1 and 2 and touch on 3. We need to get schools to more routinely deal with 4. The value of 1 is just about irrelevant in modern society.

Barbara: Is it frozen?
The Doctor: No, impossible at this temperature. Besides, it's too warm.

In fact, when we're dealing in kms, the ping time won't be affected much at all - as we're talking the speed of light over a (relatively) short distance.

However, bandwidth is affected due to signal degradation (as ADSL uses the very high, non voice carrying frequencies of the line).  The higher frequency signals are more susceptible to noise and signal loss over the twisted pair.

Reddit I'm not sure on this bit, but doesn't DSL degrade sp much due to higher frequencies needing more amplitude over the distance?  Exchange hardware is limited to the amplitude they can pump down the phone line so as to not damage voice hardware.

As I say, not sure on the last bit - but the rest is all explained here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_Digital_Subscriber_Line

IMHO that probably stems from the whole traditional ""conquest"" view of sex, where women are seen as ""giving it up"" when a persistent man finally ""pulls down her defenses"". It's the same thing as the whole slut/stud thing, with entirely different views on promiscuity across the sexes. Ultimately it's a derogatory thing, seeing women as being lesser people overall, a ""delicate flower"" to be protected etc etc. 

Personally I believe this is all because most things we do are aimed at reproduction. Maybe it's because I watch too many nature documentaries, but I really see us as no different to the birds of prey with their elaborate nesting, dancing and lovely plumage. Men need to buy a nice car and live in a trendy area to be desirable, if you believe the TV adverts. If a woman is ""giving it up"" too easy it breaks the system and society must vilify her to maintain the status quo. But that's just my opinion.

I'd be wary of changing it since we could end up with a system where you can't specialize so easily - like in the US, or where applications are based on average achievement not on specific subjects, like in Sweden.

I think GCSE's and lower education could do with a good overhaul.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"Well, for me at A-Level, (I'm doing History as I said) it was a load of facts and a lot of ""teacher says this so it must be right"". When you reach University, the lecturers are pretty much telling you to form your own opinions from different sources because even they themselves aren't 'correct'. A-Levels for me at least did not encourage development of these skills, which could be a 'per institution' problem rather than a course problem, but I would like to see GCSE and A-Level curriculums build in this skill development instead of generic fact repetition.

I agree we have to be careful to avoid the points you made, although I think programming would be better introduced as a Maths/IT hybrid, especially since IT at GCSE level was mostly learning how to use spreadsheets and macros.

It's a problem with the education system that trying to funnel 30 - 40 kids per form (probably about 200 - 300 per year group per school) into predetermined courses that don't always tailor to individual desires and strengths will typically result in a mish-mash of skills. 
GCSEs do need a lot doing to though. They really mean precious little in today's employment market. I used to work in an agency and when they recieve CVs they repurpose them and remove grade information because employers aren't bothered what you got at GCSE or A-Level - Degrees stay on though.

Donna was finally married and didn't even know who the Doctor was. Wilf probably looks like a bad luck charm to him too, so we wouldn't see that pair return.

Rose and OtherDoctor shouldn't have even been part of series 4 in my opinion, but it was definitely written to end Rose's arc. Plus they're in a parallel world which the Doctor would have no business visiting considering the trouble there's been with parallel universes in the past. Having said that, this is the only way I can see David Tennant also appearing with Matt Smith, so who knows?

As for Martha and Mickey, their inclusion at the end of their final episode was probably just so we could see how they were getting on now RTD wouldn't be writing them anymore, not as a build-up to their further adventures in DW.

And besides, when looking at Series 5 you *could* say ""oh they're just rebooting everything"", but I feel that Steven Moffat has put more work into the over-arching continuity than Russell T Davies did.

* Doctor crashes after regenerating. Meets girl with crack in her room so chooses her as a companion because something's a bit extraordinary about her life.

* Has one adventure before being phoned by Churchill to sort out the Daleks; pops into a museum just to check up on things before getting River's message, then takes Amy home. So far that's as good a set-up as any for a series, with no need or even time to show old characters from series 1-4.

* When Amy's home, Doctor realises cracks are about her so gets her out of there pronto, and because of the whole wedding thing brings Rory along too for one adventure. Then they inhale space pollen and confront the Dreamlord. Then Doctor decides to treat Amy and Rory to a trip to Rio, but as usual Doctor miscalculates and they end up in Wales.

* Rory dies, so Doctor needs to comfort Amy - the last thing he needs right now is to deal with past companions, so Doctor and Amy visit a couple of places to keep the mood bright before visiting an art gallery and realising something's wrong with Vincent. After that adventure the Doctor gets blown out of the TARDIS and has to live with humans for a week, and then for one last outing visits the first planet to see a new message from River.

Alright, so *you know* what happened this series, but there was a lot of momentum and continuity between episodes that possibly could have been dampened by treading on old ground. If Rose, Martha, Donna, or anyone else had popped up it would have been a detour in what should rightly be new adventures with a new Doctor, and slowed down what was going on with Amy, and the cracks and her love life.

Besides, for once can we have a companion just live within her own timeline instead of meeting everyone from the Doctor's past? Rose met Sarah Jane, Martha constantly heard about Rose and eventually met her, Donna met both Rose and Martha. It's been nice just having Amy and Rory dealing with Amy and Rory, and not any extra wheels to that.

Anyway, now that Matt's been established as the Doctor, who knows, maybe there'll be a few cameos in the future, but I doubt it.",0,1280355675,null,0,false,0,c0vfl4z,t3_cusl7,t1_c0vfl4z,t3_cusl7,null,1426399375,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The thing is, I don't really buy the budget cost argument. It's not like BBC One is showing dead air, after the DW, TW, etc. series is over. They still fill the time slot with something and, since it's a prime slot, likely something similarly expensive. Although the costs may not be exactly the same (I'm sure the budget for DW is well above average), they could easily reduce the number of shows they produce and make more episodes of the 'good' ones. There's nothing intrinsically cheaper about 10 episodes versus 24, from a macro perspective (given economies of scale, it may even be cheaper) 

Plus, many of these more successful shows are franchised out of Britain and into markets that pay hefty sums for them. Add to that the rather ridiculous merchandising revenues they get and it seems inconceivable as to why they don't follow the US model (at least for some of their shows).

true,halo,null,null,"It's a two-part bill which includes both the boundary changes and the AV referendum. The only reason there aren't two bills is for political reasons.  Labour support AV, but oppose the boundary changes, so are opposing the whole bill. The Coalition are trying to paint Labour as opposing the AV referendum. Labour has said they would support the AV referendum if it was a separate bill.

There are several perfectly acceptable reasons to oppose the boundary changes:

* They are equalising constituency size based on people in the electoral register rather than the population. Not everyone is on the electoral register. Currently boundaries are drawn up with census information. The demographics of people not registered likely lean to the left. 

* They are removing the ability to appeal against boundary review recommendations. People are calling shenanigans, saying it opens the door for outright gerrymandering.

* All FPTP/AV systems are inherently 'unfair' when contrasted with the popular vote (it's not a proportional system - remember the Conservatives are opposed to one). However, the reason for the boundaries currently favouring Labour is a historical accident rather than deliberate political maneuvering. This historical and independent non-partisan approach is being replaced by a system deliberately drawn up because one party is disadvantaged. This also opens the door for later maneuvering.

* The biggest advantage of non-proportional systems is that they result in MPs that represent local communities. By splitting up local communities based on population size rather than by geography, you're removing that link by combining desparate areas. The most obvious example is the biggest consistuency in the country, the Isle of Wight, where locals have long resisted calls for it to be split up into two separate constituencies which contain parts of the mainland, because it would reduce local representation.

* Reducing the number of MPs also makes local representation harder. In addition, smaller parties will be disadvantaged, because they tend to focus on winning votes in individual seats over successive elections, and a complete change in boundaries makes it harder for them to do that.",0,1280427692,null,0,false,0,c0vi2pk,t3_cuear,t1_c0vi2pk,t3_cuear,null,1426400540,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;To get classic Who you need to have met British men who meander between eccentricity and cynical cruelty thanks to a history of loss through economic woes, the Second World War and general class-driven angst.

*This is not classic Who*. Doctor Who has to evolve over time, although every man is essentially playing the same character, it still has to correlate with the time period the show is made in. And, if it's Bastard-ry he wants, Eleven is a bigger git than Ten. Shouting at humans, patting Amy on the head and then leaving her alone in a forest when she can't open her eyes... Eleven really isn't nice sometimes.

&gt;Tennant’s Tenth was just somebody’s inappropriately friendly drama teacher.

Hahah. Ok, that made me laugh.

&gt;We never get to explore the TARDIS itself, so it’s just a big room where characters can to Trek style bridge lurching and have bridging scenes between locations.

Fair enough. Would be interesting to see more of the TARDIS. I'm curious about the swimming pool and library.

&gt;Fairy tale narratives don’t excuse antagonists doing something for no good reason — and a good reason doesn’t even need to be the smartest reason.

I sort of agree with this, I wish the whole Alliance dealio could have been fleshed out a bit more, with some nice explanation.

And yet, it was worth it for that scene of Eleven being dragged into the Pandorica. He looked so scared. :(

Eh, if he doesn't like River, whatever. I do.

&gt;He simply relies on the fact that the writers have promised us that a Dalek isn’t going to shoot him in the face without ten minutes of banter.

He had a *jammie dodger!*

&gt;Smith’s Doctor is arbitrarily naive, missing signals for no other reason than the fans want him to flirt but never develop a really powerful erotic bond.

Trident is not truly independent (it is tied to the US nuclear football), but is such a deterrent even necessary when our main combatants are terrorists and fundamentalist states (who either we can't nuke because we don't know where they are, or they are irrational and so the threat of nuclear warfare wouldn't deter them)?

I just think the money would be better spent in investing in a smaller, highly trained standing army, with good technological support from Predator drones, etc. - and if we really want nuclear weaponry (though I wouldn't advise it) then we'd do better to invest in tactical weapons like the Tomahawk which can actually be used before Armageddon.

true,robosatan,null,null,"The annual defense budget is £40 billion. It cost around £5 billion to make 3 submarines over 15 years. That's £0.33 billion per year, or less than 1% of the overall budget.

That £5 billion was spent on manpower and materials provided by various suppliers across the country. So while the shipyard might budget £333 million per year, the actual cost of operating the onsite facilities is much lower. While I'm not at liberty to discuss where the money is spent, believe me when I say the majority of it does find its way across the entire country.

[Now lets consider the wellfare/benefit budget](http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/uk_welfare_spending_40.html). At over 109 billion for the year 2010, I'd question as to what its being spent on. I'd assume that it stops people from dying of starvation, gives them accomodation and provides methods for them to find work. However, I'd hazzard a guess that the £333 million (thats 0.3% of the wellfare budget) creates more jobs and provides important revenue developing businesses than an extra £333 mil spent on wellfare could provide.

So sure, we're creating pointless jobs. But they're pointless skilled jobs.

Secondly, while the submarine may be pointless now. What if we have need for one in 50 years? The shipyard that built trident faced massive layoffs in the 90s, this caused the astute class submarine to go approximately 50% over budget. All the people who are skilled and experienced at building submarines found work elsewhere and when they decided to build astute, we were left with a skeleton crew that was unprepared for the task.

Now lets say we just forget about making submarines, then in 20-30 years theres a large war that we need submarines for. Not only does it take 15 years to design and build a submarine, we'd have no facility to build one on and nobody experienced in building them either. The cost of building those required submarines would skyrocket.

true,robosatan,null,null,"I haven't really been following the news on the subject and I'm not sure where the £20 billion quote came from. What I can say is that it's extremely early in the project right now and the MoD are still pretty much undecided in what specifications we will build the submarine to. There's the ""dream submarine"" option where the navy get exactly what they want, there's the tesco blue label version that tries to incorporate as much existing design as possible and there's are other intermediate options that attempt to maximise capability while lowering the budget.

I honestly don't know which choice is popular right now, nor how many submarines they actually want. So even if we go with the low budget design I guess we could still spend £20 billion making a lot of them. That said, Astute is shaping up to cost around £8 billion for 5 boats if I quote wikipedia prices. So I'd guess the £20 billion figure comes from one of two places, it's either a ""dream submarine"" estimate or its a vision of the total cost from conception to decommision (including maintenance and crew costs). Should it be the latter, you have to appreciate that concept to decommision could be upward of 30 years, so again that £20 billion while unarguably a lot of money isn't exactly an unreasonable estimate given the timeframe. 

I guess another possibility is that figure tries to take in to account inflation. Going by the current average of around 2.2% per anum £1 today will be equivelent to £2 in 30 years. If the £20 billion estimate tries to encorporate this the cost of building the sub might actually only be £10-15 billion, just that inflated over 20 years it comes to £20 billion.

From a technology standpoint though this was always going to be an expensive boat to build. The Trident missile system began design in the 80s. So if you appreciate the replacement deterent isn't expected to be deployed until some time in the 2020's a new missle system is kind of mandatory, just think about how much mobile phones changed between the 80s and 2020! So even if the redesign to the common missile compartment does not increase its capability, a redesign would almost certainly decrease the maintence and production costs of the current system.

On a personal note I agree with you when it comes to nuclear weapons, it would be fantastic to live in a world where we have no need for such things. That said, if the current political climate disolves in to a resource rush over the coming decades nuclear weapons will save a lot of lives. 

India, Pakistan, the middle east, china, africa are all extremely dependant on relatively crude methods for industry. They don't have nuclear power in the sense of electricity and hence are extremely dependant on oil and gas to sustain their economies. Now while economically we have a lot more options when it comes to alternative ways to power our industry, we are still relatively dependant on oil. Especially when it comes to transport. Now imagine oil begins to run out and one these developing nations declare war on another weaker nation to secure all their oil reserves. If this happens to be the nation that we depend on for a large portion of our oil then we could potentially face serious economic troubles if we don't try to intervene and defend our interests so to speak.

Now how could we do that? Well we could spend a lot of money defending the country with conventional forces (army/airforce), or! We could park a single submarine off the coast of the offending nation and politely ask them to reconsider their actions. 

If that single submarine can avert a war then I think it's a far better option than the alternative which would almost certainly lead to significant loss of life. Hell, even if they call our bluff and still go to war is it not better that we had the option to try and stop things early? Nuclear deterrents aren't limited to nuclear warheads, sadly they were used in the middle east recently to fire cruise missiles on iraq and afghanistan. So even if the ""we have nukes"" negotiation does not work, it does mean we have strong artillery to help limit our own casualities.

Oh, and since I've brought up resource wars and the fact our subs were used in Iraq. Personally, I think the entire debacle was a farce set up by the aristocracies of the west to profiteer. If the submarines I help build are used in a similar manner then I will be driving to downing street to protest.",0,1280511653,null,0,true,0,c0vl6id,t3_cvcbl,t1_c0vl6id,t1_c0vkxxk,null,1426402002,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"This is dodgy ground, how many firms are going to just say OK no more interns then if this is the case. 

I myself was an 'intern' 'tape op' tea boy' whatever you want to call it with a recording studio for a year, I got all of my expenses paid, but to be honest I was just glad to be shown the ropes by a professional in a first class working studio within such a competitive industry. Being paid was the last thing on my mind and that year I learned more about my industry than it's *ever* possible to do at university.  

Someone's going to be thinking: Ah him again, Just another pointless 'anecdotal' story, so... to back up what I'm saying, this is what I was doing [yesterday afternoon in Kendal.](http://i.imgur.com/6rWUx.jpg) I got up yesterday at 7am and I didn't get back to London till 2am this morning. FTR 10 years + of hard work to get to this level. 

Anyway, back to my point: In really competitive industries like the one I work in, I think people should be counting their blessings that they have actually *secured* an internship rather than worrying about getting any money for it, use it as a stepping stone to further your career and if you feel like you're being used as cheap labour it's up to you to say to the firm: Hold on a minute, I'm not learning anything here, you're using me and I'm not happy with this situation at all. Instead of being passive and letting them walk all over you. Because if you are, they will. 

The money comes later. Learn to crawl before you can fly quite frankly. 

Edit: I'm also going to add that I actually have 'Santa's little helper' who comes around with me to festivals now and again, he's doing a music tech degree and I'm teaching him my job, he doesn't get paid ( He does however get free beer and food ) he just sits and he watches, asks relevant questions and to be honest he's so grateful to me that I really don't feel bad about not paying him.

true,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"I'm currently studying Physics at Exeter Uni (might as well name it as it's in my comment history anyway), which is generally regarded as fairly useful, I suppose perhaps Engineering is more useful maybe. But anyway the only way I've been able to afford it is because I got a merit scholarship which to be honest was based largely on luck as well as merit.

I am very impressed with the OU as a family member is studying a maths degree with them and whilst it is certainly cheaper than a conventional degree it is still fairly expensive. I think it is fine for things like Humanities and Arts and Maths where there aren't any labs, but for sciences and engineering(often regarded as useful subjects) I think the lack of labs makes them a lot worse than conventional degrees.

I don't know why you said choose a useful skill or subject to study as your first point though, you don't get any more money for studying Engineering or Physics than you do for doing English Lit or Media Studies.

As for working in the holidays, I've tried finding work this year but it's been a failure so far, I seem to fail because I can only work for three months and don't have any experience, and as my university is far from my home I can't work even part-time at the shop/office/etc. during termtime.

As for doing professional qualifications - why would an accountant hire someone who has done a professional qualification when they can choose from the masses of graduates with accounting degrees(yes they exist, and are rather popular) who also have the professional accreditation?

I'm not familiar with Birkbeck but isn't that in London? Which is a rather expensive place to live.

&gt;The blowout preventer schematic drawings, provided by Transocean to BP, do not correspond to the structure that is on the ocean bottom.

one where they both seem to be:

&gt;Employee Tyrone Benton told the BBC on 21 June that a leak was spotted on a crucial piece of equipment in the oil rig's blowout preventer weeks before the accident, and that Transocean and BP were emailed about it

and one where its probably a BP staff member:
&gt;According to the testimony of Doug Brown, the chief mechanic on the Deepwater Horizon, on 26 May at the joint U.S. Coast Guard and Minerals Management Service hearing, a BP representative overruled Transocean employees and insisted on displacing protective drilling mud with seawater just hours before the explosion.[277] One of the BP representatives on the board responsible for making the final decision, Robert Kaluza, refused to testify on the Fifth Amendment grounds that he might incriminate himself; Donald Vidrine, another BP representative, cited medical reasons for his inability to testify, as did James Mansfield, Transocean's assistant marine engineer on board.

Thing is, the rig had 126 crew, of which only 7 were BP.

I'm not saying that BP aren't at fault at all, that would be ridiculous, but it seems extremely odd to me that Transocean aren't getting equal part of the blame, if not more, from what I've read ^_^

I don't see why the poor state of the equipment is BP's fault? Everything was owned by Transocean and operated by them. Most of the seven BP staff seemed to be there monitoring how much oil appeared...

Also, BP definitely do have safety policies when operating rigs... this wasn't a BP rig though!

You think Transocean use totally different policies and systems when the rig is doing work for Shell, say?
