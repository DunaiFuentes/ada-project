true,bpp198,null,null,"It's similar to the Redditch borough crest. From: http://redditch.whub.org.uk/cms/council-and-democracy/councillors-and-committees/mayor/borough-crest.aspx

Arms were granted to Redditch Urban District Council by Letters Patent dated 15th December 1943.  They could be blazoned:

Argent on a Cross engrailed Vert a Needle point downwards of the field eyed and ensigned with an Ancient Crown Or in the first quarter a Salmon-Fly in bend proper.

Crest

In front of a demi-Cogwheel thereon a Swift rising proper an Arrow fesswise Or

Motto

REDDITE DEO (Render to God/Redditch for God)

Redditch became a Borough on the 15th May 1980.  New Letters Patent were issued dated 2nd March 1984 which exemplified the transfer of the Arms of the former Urban District Council to the new Borough.  The Crest was altered slightly.

The Swift, very simply, became a Kingfisher.  This was done at the request of the new Borough and reflected the growing association between Redditch and the most attractive of birds.

Redditch has grown from a hamlet near the Cistercian Abbey of Bordesley.  The white of the shield is taken from the monks' habit.  The Cross is a reference to St Stephen, patron of both the Abbey and the Parish Church.  The green of the Cross commemorates Feckenham Forest.  The Borough stands within this former Forest.  The Ancient Crown alludes to King John who made the forest ""Royal"", and to his grandmother the Empress Maud who founded the Abbey in 1138.  The needle and the salmon-fly mark the principal industries.  The Crest refers also to important industries by showing a demi-cogwheel.   The arrow is an obvious allusion to the River Arrow, which flows through Redditch.  It is also a symbol of the speed and directness of modern road and air transport.

The Wreath that covers the join between Crest and Helm is of six twists of silk.  White alternating with green.  The Mantling that hangs down from the Wreath is green on top and white underneath.  (The Mangling was originally used to keep the sun off the neck of the knight wearing the helm, or helmet.)

The motto is a quotation from Mark Chapter XII, Verse 17.  ""Reddite quae sunt Caesaris, Caesari; et quae Dei sunt, Deo"" which means ""Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's"".

No, it was directed towards the people making the claims.

There is a bit of a difference in saying there were ""indiscriminate assaults by police using electric stun batons"" and the more likely truth that tempers on all sides were flaring and that some of the scuffles may have gotten out of hand.

&gt; Secondly, after one Lib Dem claimed the coalition 'had abolished tuition fees' and Clegg claimed that protests would put off prospective applicants to University, 'truth' is clearly something that was rendered meaningless in this debate some time ago.

I thought Cleggs point was that the details of the changes, which will be better for some students, were being drowned out by the misinformation coming from the protest movement, and that the NUS were using this rather than attempting to correct it. I happen to agree with this point.

""BBC to launch iPlayer globally
 Published: December 1 2010 12:44

The BBC is to launch a commercial version of its iPlayer video on demand technology, using a subscription model on Apple iPads and with the US probably the first to receive the service.

It will be available only outside the UK, where the BBC is not allowed to charge for its content, and marks a new stage in the broadcaster’s move to exploit its content around the world.""

&gt;I think you will be rewarded by perseverance. Yes, Rose is not a good episode, but it was to reintroduce an already well established character in a way that was rewarding for long time fans as well as pleasing to newcomers.

&gt;Most of the mystery of it would have excited fans I think (Rose was my first episode too, so I just wanted to get into seeing this ""Doctor"" being a total time-travelling badass), and the Autons were an old enemy of the Doctor, so that helped give it some...historical authenticity? And at least showed fans that they could make Doctor Who a 21st century show even with old villains.

&gt;What you've got to remember with DW is that it is tongue-in-cheek early-evening family entertainment, and as such may appear cheesy or have a lot of situations that don't reward hardcore fans of sci-fi or horror or time-travel etc.

&gt;But keep watching and you'll notice that the writing becomes stronger, the characters more fleshed out, and the episodes as a whole more fulfilling. Once everything becomes established, who's who and what's what, then it is very satisfying enjoying each new adventure.

&gt;Sure there are low points, and when they're bad, they're really bad (see Love and Monsters), yet when they're good, they're excellent (see Blink). It's a mixed bag, but you'll be rewarded for persevering.

Or land to be possessed:

Wherever the savage nations

To coddle, coerce or scare,

You may look for the vaunted emblem

For the Flag of England is there!

II

Aye, it waves over the blazing hovels

Whence its African victims fly

To be shot by explosive bullets

Or wretchedly starve and die:

Or where the beachcomber hammers

The isles of tbe southern sea -

From the peak of his hellish vessel

The English flag flies free!


III

The Maori, full of hate, curses

With his fleeting, dying breath.

And the Arab hath hissed his curses

As he spat at its folds in death.

The hapless fellah hath feared it

On Tel el Kebir's parched plain.

And the blood of the Zulu hath stained it,

With a deep indelible stain.


IV

It has floated over scenes of pillage

As he ravished with Sword and flame:

And assassination dire and grim.

Drown even the jingo hymn.

Where is the flag of England?

Seek the land where the natives rot

And decay, and assured extinction

Must soon be the people's lot.

Go to the once fair island

Where disease and death are rife

And the greed of colossal commerce

Now fattens on human life.

Where is the flag of England?

Go sail where the rich galleons come

With their shoddy and wasted cotton,

And beer and Bibles and rum.

Seek the land where brute force hath triumphed

And hypocrisy hath its lair.

anyway, she works 9 to 5 knocking door to door in rough run down estates. why she does this? Well, who is at home 9 to 5?

So, she intereacts with maybe 100 unemployed people a day, 5 days a week, 260 days a year. She's been doing this for a few years now and so you can appreciate the sample she has interacted with. Of these people, she has met few who are not like those in the tv show Shamelss. So much scum. 

** A story always sticks in my head when I hear talk of cutting benefits is one she told me last winter:**

my mum is walking round the streets and knocking doors. she was a rookie at this point and this was her first week. the day was a cold thursday. She knocked doors and no one answered. through the whole street there was not one house with someone in.

she finally got a resonse after a good hour. a young woman in her early 20s opened up holding a baby to her dirty t-shirt and with a toddler at her feet. My mum did her thing and said her piece. the woman listerened and invited her in. This was common. when they are not paying for the money they are more likely to spend it on anything that comes to them - £30 is not 6 hours work to them, it comes to them by them holding their hand out to the taxpayer each week.

so my mum and her got talking and my mum asked why so few people. the woman grinned widely and pointed to the calendar on the wall. ash dropped from her fag as she sneered

""today is thursday. today is the day us doleys spend you taxpayer's money""

the woman signed up and with that my mum left the comfortable heated housr that her taxes paid for and into the freezing streets to earn a living and pay more taxes to the likes of that woman can spend it. And with this I have no pitty left for those on benefits. my mum has intereact with so many and 99% are just like that.

edit: my dad is also on benefits. he is scum. He has not worked in 20 years. I am 21 and have paid more taxes than him. He made himself purposely obese. I know this becase a few years back he started losing weight by using a exercise bike. well, it eventually dawned on him that he will loose his benefits if he is no longer obese and therefore no longer ""disabled"". fastforward to now and he has a house paid for the tax payer, a car, a kitchen full of food and as much hot water and electricty as he wants to use.

I'd like to find a reference for this that isn't Wikipedia, but meh.

Point is - if the government thinks that it's policies will eventually solve unemployment anyway, then there is no crisis. 

I find it amusing that the welfare reform echoes quite well the Poor Law reforms in 1834 - those too were enacted by a government declaring itself to be 'progressive' and were heavily influenced by the notion of able-bodied workers taking relief payments (or benefits, as it would be today) and the governments desires to cut the cost of providing this relief. 

The end result was an attempt to make welfare worse than the lowest paid job - something we don't need to see in this day and age. I would like to think that the government knows better, but so far their policy is very 'hands-off' with regards to unemployment. I'm assuming their intent is to shrink the government and simply nudge the economy in particular directions rather than intentionally stimulate it and encourage reliance on the state.

I'm not a huge fan of the smaller state approach - there was a good reason it grew to this size and this is an experiment I don't think a lot of the voters wanted to see.

So if you count ""working"" as producing a Dickensian-style army of poorly paid workers constantly in fear of losing work then I suppose it does work.

Ultimately there is no natural law that there is enough work for all citizens, and so this will always lead to a desperate competition between the unemployed for whatever work they can find. Why is it that with all the technology and productive capacity we have now that this ""Battle of Life"" is still necessary? Surely it is better that we provide everyone with work and relieve the work burden on all, rather than denying some the necessities of life (despite the fact we have them in effective abundances) just to use them as slave labour.

As [Einstein wrote](http://huppi.com/kangaroo/Einstein.htm):

&gt;Production is carried on for profit, not for use. There is no provision that all those able and willing to work will always be in a position to find employment; an ""army of unemployed"" almost always exists. The worker is constantly in fear of losing his job. Since unemployed and poorly paid workers do not provide a profitable market, the production of consumers' goods is restricted, and great hardship is the consequence. Technological progress frequently results in more unemployment rather than in an easing of the burden of work for all. The profit motive, in conjunction with competition among capitalists, is responsible for an instability in the accumulation and utilization of capital which leads to increasingly severe depressions. Unlimited competition leads to a huge waste of labor, and to that crippling of the social consciousness of individuals which I mentioned before.",0,1291370940,null,0,false,0,c17pbbm,t3_ef78i,t1_c17pbbm,t1_c17nxjh,null,1426608383,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

If you want to make it competitive, you have to up the fees. That stops wasters going into the system, makes degrees worth more but it also stops these mythical poor people getting into uni (I never once came across a single ""poor"" person while I was at uni). 

If you keep it cheap or free, you let people in who will piss the time away (I'm Scottish and one of my best friends studied animal biology for 4 years despite having no desire to work in the field) and you dilute the value of the degrees by flooding the job market with 2:2s and even now 2:1s are losing their value. 

I think they certainly do need to up fees and I think that the technically not debt is the correct approach to do it.

There's a huge emphasis on development of skills at University you simply don't have earlier on down the road. These skills we are meant to be acquiring at University should really be started a lot sooner if they are so useful.

I would prefer a system that moves away from traditional exams and more into assisting the youth of today work out just what they want to do - instead of dropping them on their arse at 16 if college isn't their thing, there should be programmes that help them develop whatever appeals to them that schools should help provide.

There's a slight problem in that individualism goes out of the window if you create a too far-reaching education system and people can't find their own feet whilst being in danger of being slotted into a career they may not want to do.

It's an awkward question, and I think it would be worth reassessing the education system on a major level rather than just tweaking it. I think a lot could be done to improve it. ",0,1291396966,null,0,false,0,c17qdwt,t3_efmmy,t1_c17qdwt,t1_c17qa2f,null,1426608883,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

That's not to say I have a better idea, but I think it's something a few people are bothered by.

If you finish University and your parents or whatever can give you the money to pay off your debts sooner rather than later - your education is thus cheaper than someone who cannot get this additional aid as the interest will accumulate on the loan account. Should you suddenly find yourself in a job that pays enough to start repayments, you will have this loan over your head for a very long time.

Cameron totally missed the message, songs about social disadvantage, alienation and bullying/thuggery going way over his head as he pranced about as an elite Bullingdon bully. Even then, he couldn't have missed Morissey's comments on the Brighton bombing aside from numerous matters. Makes me think of Reagan using Born in the USA for his election trail. Totally missing the point.

Wagner was a bit of an anti-Semite mind. Although it is known not through the music immediately, the knowledge this lay behind it does put me off him, though at the same time I can appreciate religious works and architecture whilst having no affiliation to the philosophy. Don't think that is exactly the same though.

Nilsen is obviously a monster, but I couldn't help having a slight dark laugh on reading a story from when he was arrested. He was caught after the drains were blocked with human flesh. Upon arrest when in a cell, he asked a junior constable what to do with his cigarette butts not having an ashtray. He was told told flush them down the toilet, to which he replied the last time he did that he was arrested. The policeman laughed. As did I. I'm going to hell.

That said, I think this is the wrong way of looking at it entirely. Ultimately this is just a symptom of the much larger crisis of unemployment we are facing, as greater automation, outsourcing, immigration, etc. is reducing the number of careers available for young people.

By increasing the fees you will deter people from studying, so what will these people do instead? The youth unemployment rate is ever-increasing, so they're most likely to go on the dole, so in effect we pay for them anyway, but just to waste their lives rather than be educated.

And in principle I think that we _need_ to invest in education and research, since we should aim for a society where we can eventually automate all the menial work.

So, it's a difficult problem certainly. I think the fees increases are better than the graduate tax proposal, but both are pretty terrible 'solutions' really.

Also, you're far from the only student with these views. Here at Exeter it seems most people agree with you, but they tend to be the people who could easily afford it anyway and so couldn't really care less, whereas I know if I had to pay the higher fees I would have seriously considered applying abroad rather than just settling for the scholarship I have here, as interest would become a significant problem.",0,1291411398,null,0,false,0,c17rhgi,t3_efmmy,t1_c17rhgi,t3_efmmy,null,1426609417,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Having said that, the tracks [The Queen is Dead](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz5IFl7uCis&amp;feature=related) and [Panic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6Yzj0FDTIk) made for brilliant Jarman pieces. These were a pinnacle of high art meets popular music in that period for me.

You are making the primary economic fallacy of assuming a rational market. People are not rational. They do not think in the long term and it has bugger all to do with motivation. It has long been known that psychologically people will take a moderate pay out now over a big payout tomorrow. The same is true of debts. People will balk at a massive debt even if it means a larger long term pay out. They will give greater weight to the immediate figure and less weight to the long term picture.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"So, if you pay it back over 20 years under the current system, you wouldn't be paying back more than if you repaid it within say, 2 weeks of graduation?

I'm slightly confused now. My original point was that tuition fees were unfair on poorer families because those with more money can take out a loan and potentially clear it instantly upon graduation if their background allows them to draw upon that - the result is that they have no negative balance to apply interest to, while those who have to work to be able to pay it back effectively, as far as I understood it, would be paying it back but with some interest applied. 

I'm not intending to say people with wealth shouldn't be able to have goods with no debt attached if they can afford it. My point is that tuition fees and the intent of using University as a platform to 'better' those who are poorer are somewhat at loggerheads as a product of this. I'm not 100% sure, but I remember reading that this was one of the reasons a graduate tax was preferred, as it hit all graduates equally and made them all contribute back in a proportional manner.

Personally I think the whole tuition fee issue needs a significantly bigger debate. This report and it's recommendations are being rushed in far too soon, and it bothers me. The government statements on it too also bother me - if it really isn't as bad as people are saying, why are they not publishing a clear cut concise statement of figures and how they work out which proves these protests are about nothing?

true,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt;But is the country really so against the increase in tuition fees?

[I found this poll that suggests that yes they are.](http://today.yougov.co.uk/politics/tuition-fee-opposition) You can't assume that the people that the people on the protest are the only ones that are against the tuition fee raise, not everyone feels the need to protest about every government decision they disagree with.

There are people who have no plans to go to university who still disagree with the tuition fee raises, because they would rather live in a country where they and their children have the option of going to further education without being saddled with debt for the rest of their lives. Further education should be free, it should not be an investment where children of 17 have to calculate whether their likely increased earning potential justifies 30k of debt. 

I agree that there is a limited amount of money to go around but that doesn’t mean there is a direct choice between tuition fee raises and people being hungry, cold or dead as you have put it! There are other ways the government could raise money, for example introducing a new tax like the mansion tax,  spending less money on nukes, [or just collecting the tax they are already owed.]( http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/nov/14/vodafone-tax-evasion-revenue-customs)

That's the gripe, if there's anything dodgy going on it's in the highly complex rules regarding residences for tax purposes.  Somehow punishing Topshop as a business - which is a successful British business employing thousands - is absurd.

That quote you provide is designed to muddy the waters and make it sound more sordid than it is.  If Green owed tax then he owes tax; him moving money via Jersey wouldn't hide or nullify that fact.  The simple truth is that he doesn't owe tax because:

   * Topshop is owned by his wife.
   * His wife lives in Monaco.
   * By virtue of neither living nor working in the UK, his wife doesn't owe any UK taxes.

true,bcash,null,null,"So are you suggesting that if a dividend is paid offshore that the government should raise taxes on the profits of that business to compensate?

There's a certain amount of logic there, but what Phillip Green does is even more cynical then you think.

Essentially his strategy with Topshop (and BHS, and everything else) goes a little something like this:

   * Find a cashflow positive, neglected business.
   * Go for the quick wins - flatten management, shorten the supply chain, etc.  (So far, so good, here's where it gets clever/outrageous.)
   * Even though the company is profitable, and sometimes even sitting on a cash pile, he will work out how much debt that company can take on based on using the company's profits to meet the interest obligations.
   * Based on this, his companies borrow billions.
   * His companies then pay ""special dividends"" equal to the amount raised.
   * Philip Green and wife then have all the cash, his companies all the debt; the creditors are happy as long as the interest is met (which it is, he's not cack-handed like some others who have ballsed up this point).

So to say he dodged paying £300 million on his company's profits is wrong, because they didn't make £1bn that year.  That's how much they borrowed.  The ""profit"" was just an accounting technique.

And this is how the whole private equity world works.  And in that world there's a dozens worse than Philip Green.  The only reason he's been targeted is that he's an easily identifiable individual; the largest private equity firms are faceless and therefore more difficult to hate.",0,1291508003,null,0,false,0,c17vgln,t3_eg5ni,t1_c17vgln,t1_c17ve6w,null,1426611288,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I'm willing to bet that Phillip Green takes most of his earnings from topshop through these tax avoidance channels, this means he pays less tax on his profits than other business owners such as small business owners. Business men don't run businesses for the good of mankind you know, they do it for profit and it takes a certain level  of profit to make it worth their while. If he couldn't make somuch profit he would probably put prices up.

Another advantage is more profits also mean more cash that can be pumped back into their company should it need it
&gt;Somehow punishing Topshop as a business - which is a successful British business employing thousands - is absurd.

Can it really be considered British if it's owned by a foreign national and all its products are made by wage slaves in third world countries?

We lower our corporation tax and repeal our labour laws to remain competitive?

Then we will soon no longer be able to fund the NHS, and our public services, etc.

It will just start a race to the bottom as every nation must cut their taxes, public services and living conditions to provide the cheapest labour and place of operation for the businesses.

But then again, we have little choice, as otherwise the nation is not self-sustainable and so businesses leaving will seriously harm the country. And so we see how the whole word is being enslaved under cries of free trade and free markets.


To quote the Nobel Laureate Frederick Soddy:

&gt;""The monetary system is not outworn or senile. 
It is novel, upstart, and imperious, defeating 
technological progress by turning it into the 
channels of destruction, and challenging the 
autonomy not of one nation but of all alike, so 
that now the original authorities constituted for 
the preservation of that autonomy needs must 
fawn upon it to rule at all. Hampered by national 
frontiers, nothing can satisfy it till the whole 
world is made safe for banking, that its funda- 
mental insolvency may defy exposure. Under 
the specious guise of a unification of humanity, 
it aims at absolute dictatorship under which none 
shall be allowed to live save by its favour and for 
the advancement of its transcendent whims.""

Or the Communist Manifesto:

&gt;""The bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population, of the means of production, and of property. It has agglomerated population, centralised the means of production, and has concentrated property in a few hands. The necessary consequence of this was political centralisation. Independent, or but loosely connected provinces, with separate interests, laws, governments, and systems of taxation, became lumped together into one nation, with one government, one code of laws, one national class-interest, one frontier, and one customs-tariff.""

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"There is no legal right to protest under British or EU law. You have the right to ""peaceful assembly"" under article 11 of the EU Convention on Human Rights, along with rights to free speech (which is restricted under British law, so you can be arrested for hate speech or swearing), and free association. But there is not Right to Protest as a legal term. [This](http://www.yourrights.org.uk/yourrights/the-right-of-peaceful-protest/) explains the extent of your ability to protest and the restrictions the police can place upon it.

Also, when it comes to being technically able to arrest anyone in a protest, under the [Common Law Breach of the Peace](http://www.yourrights.org.uk/yourrights/the-rights-of-suspects/police-powers-of-arrest/arrest-at-common-law-for-breach-of-the-peace.html) you can be arrested if the police suspect you are going to breach the peace. This is not something you can be charged with, but you can be arrested for it, as explained [here](http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=Breach_of_the_peace#Breach_of_the_peace). Since the crowd on both sides had moved into what could be defined as ""intimidating"" behaviour, the police could have arrested hundreds of people on both sides for breach of the peace.

So, it is perfectly lawful to arrest someone but not charge them, and that does not mean that the arrest was illegal or unwarranted.

The law is complicated, and just because you feel you have the right to do something, it does not mean that you actually have a right to do that in legal terms.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; It will just start a race to the bottom as every nation must cut their taxes, public services and living conditions to provide the cheapest labour and place of operation for the businesses.

Apologies for not making myself clear, but I agree wholeheartedly with the points you made.  I didn't mean to imply that we should be following the Swiss lead, but rather to highlight how difficult it is for Britain to remain competitive when the Swiss are offering 15% in corporate taxation.  Not to mention the Cayman Island and other offshore retreats of the rich and powerful.

Of course, the fact of the matter is that the companies involved aren't really based in Switzerland.  Rather, they have a small head office in Switzerland that allows them to evade the higher taxation in the countries in which they actually are operating.  The Swiss get 15% of €shitloads for doing nothing, other than playing their complicit part in the scam.

Personally I think that all products of ""Swiss"" companies should be subject to import tax in the same way that other non-EU goods are taxed upon entry into this country.  If Kraft want to be a Swiss company then fine, but they can't be a British company as well.  

**TL;DR:** Kraft can have their mass-produced, artificially sweetened cake with an suspiciously long shelf life but they can't eat it.

Alternatively I've had people on alcohol want to beat me shitless just because I walked past them.

true,stordoff,null,null,"I've copied the wall of text I give to someone who applied for Maths at Clare below. I was very tired when I wrote it so it's not perfect, but may be of interest.

&gt;Two links from the Clare website which may help if you hadn't seen them: http://www.clare.cam.ac.uk/admissions/interviews.html (General Advice) and http://www.clare.cam.ac.uk/admissions/subjects/maths.html (Guide to Mathematics).

&gt;My experiences are a little atypical, as I first interviewed at Trinity and was pooled ( http://www.clare.cam.ac.uk/admissions/the_pool.html ) to Selwyn.

&gt;My interview at Trinity consisted of a written maths paper (I applied for Computer Science), and a discussion after. The difficult of the paper was about the level of STEP / a little above A level. The discussion after was _hard_. They (the two fellows interviewing me) concentrated on the stuff I missed in the exam, and went beyond A Level standard. Coming out of it, I was convinced that I had completely failed.

&gt;I was later informed that I had been pooled, and sometime after Selwyn recalled me to interview with them. Speaking to friends, they have a far more typical interview style (Trinity is pretty hardcore).

&gt;First up, I had a brief interview with the Senior Tutor, which was easy background stuff (Why this course, personal statement etc.). This seemed to be more for my benefit than the college's. This was followed by two subject interviews, one with the Director of Studies (DoS) for Computer Science and one with the DoS for physics.

&gt;The computer science one was very general, and I was guided towards an answer after being told some new ideas rather than relying on existing knowledge. (Questions in the style of ""Say we have system that does X. How could we adapt it to do Y?"")

&gt;The physics interview presumed more, and at first seemed that the questions were much beyond A-Level. However, the interviewer was happy to give hints (and even partial solutions), and I soon realized that it was A-Level material. It had just been combined in unusual ways.

&gt;The things I took away from this are:

&gt;1) DON'T PANIC. The interview seems much more difficult if you aren't relaxed.

&gt;2) Don't presume failure. Even if the interview seems to be going badly, you may still be offered a place. One of my friends ended up talking about a nuclear bungee jumper and still ended up here.

&gt;3) It's mostly A-Level work. New ideas may be introduced, but if you say ""I haven't covered this"" or similar, the interviewer will explain the concept or ask an alternative question. Bear in mind that A-Level syllabuses differ, so it's not expected that you will know everything.

&gt;4) The interview isn't out to trick you. They are interested in how you think and apply basic ideas, not that you have memorized the contents of a library. Try to give an answer, but don't be afraid to say ""I don't know"". Often a small hint will set you on the right path.

&gt;5) Be enthusiastic. They are looking not only for the best candidates, but people that they would enjoy teaching. If you seem genuinely interested, it'll work in your favor.

I agree that we can't just raise the minimum wage because the businesses will move elsewhere, but you have to realise that your argument also means that there is a perpetual race to the bottom between nations, as every nation must lower all it's taxes (not just corporation tax, but income tax, etc. too as the lower the cost of living for the people, the lower the wages can be) to lower the costs for corporations and remain competitive in the global market.

This leads to inevitable cuts in public services and benefits, and the repeal of labour laws. And yet people will welcome it! For any job is better than none, and the neoliberal politicians will cite the high unemployment and high national debt as examples of the failure of Keynesian policies, and so rise to power whilst cutting the public services and repealing the labour laws.

And they will succeed in making the nation competitive again, as it becomes cheaper to use our labour than to outsource or automate work, however it will be at the cost of all the benefits we have come to take for granted in our society - the NHS, the welfare state, etc.

But it is completely inevitable with the rise of global capitalism. One nation cannot stand on it's own feet anymore. Like sorcerers overpowered by their own creations, all nations are now powerless to the demands of the multinational corporations, and the governments are dominated by the same capitalists who with their huge wealth and ownership of the media can destroy any chance of a real democracy.

Dear ____

I won't pretend to have voted for you, one of the few things I was optimistic about when the Labour government were removed was an end to the near-persecution of scientists such as David Nutt for daring to come to conclusions incompatible with the prejudice of those in power at the time on the bizarrely ""hot"" issue of drugs...

Chance would be a fine thing, as I read this week that the government plan to remove the requirement for ministers to even consult those qualified on such issues before deciding what arbitrary chemical should next become illegal.

While I'm not surprised that the government prioritises the whims of tabloid newspapers over that which is scientifically demonstrable, I am a little disappointed. If the government actually wants to protect those vulnerable to the effects of drugs and avoid wasting the time of a police force that will find themselves more and more stretched as the brutal extent of the current cuts make themselves felt, I would hope that they consider doing so by following scientific advice when it comes to drug policy. 

I also feel that the futility in having a possible outcome of 5 years in prison for possession of cannabis is shown both in the flagrant disregard for that law from both the general public and those charged with enforcing it. The then-government's argument that the existence of stronger strains warranted the return to class B makes about as much sense as prohibition of alcohol due to the existence of Absynthe or Everclear. I perhaps naively look forward to the day when those addicted to hard drugs like heroin are treated as ill and not as criminals, and that cannabis produces the government lots of tax money as they regulate it to ensure safety and availability only to those considered old enough.

That's absolutely absurd. Some sectors attract more women (I'm thinking primary school teaching) and some sectors attract more men (Engineering and such).. 

That's not because of sexism, it's just how it is. Why force 40% of a engineering companies board to be men when only 5% of the actual employees might be women? It's total misrepresentation.

No mate. That *is* because of sexism. Why do you think more teachers are women? Because society has created an environment where it is expected that more women be teachers, because it is a ""woman's job"". It is a similar situation for engineering. There are less woman in engineering because it is viewed as a ""man's job"". These biases are what cause capable women to pass over jobs they are legitimately qualified to do, and employers to pass over women for jobs they are legitimately qualified to do.

Pedantry aside, you've hit the nail on the head:

Which is precisely why schools that cater to the more able students are essential.

I was also not oppressed by the culture of underperformance that comprehensives tend to suffer from. In a school with a ""diverse range of cultures, abilities, and learning styles"" the more able students get bullied for being swots, geeks and nerds and quickly learn to perform closer to the average if they want to survive.

It's not necessary for grammar schools to be public schools; there are a number of state grammar schools available, although vanishingly few.

I am (I'm reasonably sure) the only Oxbridge student to have been through that school *ever*, since it's now gone. I did GCSEs there, then A levels at [Richard Huish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Huish_College,_Taunton) (the only state 6th form in town that did A levels, and also a reasonably good one, I think).

I, controversial, don't think Oxbridge is biased against people like me. I think they genuinely pick fairly reasonably from the applicants who apply, and choose acceptably fairly, based on the information they have from A levels and interviews. This definitely does give a pronounced boost to the private school percentages, since they also happen to get a big chunk of the good A levels (another debate) but it's not a active discrimination on class, or race, or anything like that, it's far more that the earlier levels of the schools system that provide the required good grades are also filled with white middle class students. There's a (very obvious) argument that this isn't proportional to ability, and good kids in bad school get worse results and thus talent is hidden from universities, but it's a tough issue to fix. They could do it by ignoring grades for people from bad schools (I think quite a bit of that information might not be visible to them), or similar, but that's very very difficult to do, and much more subjective, which leaves them wide open for *masses* of criticism. 

Basically, I blame the schools, rather than Oxbridge. I knew nothing about good universities at all (wouldn't of recognized names) pre-6th form, and if it hadn't been for some lucky meeting with some good careers-y type people there then I would never even have considered such things, and my life would be very different. I have an impression that Eton et al on the other hand have a culture where it's expected that the best and brightest can do anything, and where there are always people on hand, looking for potential, and pushing kids for it.

It does create a divide, but it's a necessary divide.  I agree that it's too absolute at a specific age: to decide once and for all at the age of eleven or thirteen who goes where.  Many children are later bloomers and they miss out as a result.

What should happen is to have several chances to switch between the systems, and to *destigmatise* the non-grammar schools by putting in much better resources.

Of course, they're not going to tell you anything beyond the bureaucratic and obvious.  I'm excused from service, because of my legal background, which broadly means I know too much about how the system works.  I could tell you, but then I'd have to shoot you.

Seriously, a few pointers.  Sadly, it's unlikely you'll get to sit on any juicy cases, most of the cases which come before the courts are dull and predictable and short.  Do try to pay attention though and do your best to reach a fair decision, it may not be life of death, but it's still people's lives you're deciding about.  Bear in mind whether those giving evidence are professionals who are used to giving evidence or general members of the public, and judge them accordingly.  Remember you can ask questions of the judge (by sending notes - but don't abuse this right), ask to see evidence again or to take physical evidence into the jury room when you deliberate.  You'll also be instructed by the judge that the law is for him/her and the facts are for you, but be aware that as no one can inquire into how a jury reached its verdict you can acquit or convict at your discretion and use this to achieve your vision of justice regardless.  

Don't let the unfamiliar setting or the officials of the court browbeat or intimidate you, you are the most important people there (and, although some judges may see you as a mere inconvenience, for the most part they all know that).  If you detect that the judge is prosecution or defence minded, use your own judgement to counterbalance that when considering your verdict.

Edit: One of my favourite jury stories concerned a case I was on where a guy was accused of stealing some golf clubs.  His defence was pretty sketchy, but he put in a sterling performance in the witness box and managed to come across as a thoroughly nice guy (to be fair, he was).  Anyway, we were pretty surprised when after a fairly lengthy retirement, the jury came back to acquit him.  Now, after a trial is over, the legal team/defendants etc. aren't supposed to have any contact with jury members, but as we were leaving the court with our client, we walked past several members of the jury.  The barrister, turned and breezily waved at them, saying ""I'm not supposed to talk with you, but just to say thanks.""  So, the lady foreman of the jury looks up with a smile, directs a piercing glance at the defendant, and says ""Okay, so just don't do it again!""",0,1291722635,null,0,true,0,c185eg2,t3_ehlly,t1_c185eg2,t3_ehlly,null,1426615994,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

[No it doesn't](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/nov/26/tuitionfees.students). Which is rather the point.

&gt; Brynin has been studying Margaret Hodge's equation from the opposite end of the telescope. His research team has conducted a survey into the disbenefits of having a degree. Brynin explains that as industry sectors become saturated with graduates, wage rates fall. ""Graduates only maintain their premium if they work in a field where their skills are in short supply."" Which means that as more graduates pour on to the labour market, so wages will be depressed.

Having a degree is no longer a guarantee of a graduate level position, riches, or a quick path to success, and hasn't been for about [15 years](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/student/article6843191.ece).

Firstly they must recognise that with global capitalism, such protests are ineffective in one nation. Since the government has to lower taxes to remain competitive on the international labour market (or risk the businesses withdrawing), this combined with the increasing automation causing greater wealth inequality, is lowering the tax revenue significantly.

This competition between nations leads to a race to the bottom of cutting taxes which must be followed by cutting services or increasing the national debt. This means that nations have effectively lost their sovereignty, as the decisions are forced upon them either indirectly from competition for multinational corporations or directly from IMF intervention when the national debt grows too large.

Following from this realisation they must organise with protesters across the world, to stop this relentless march towards a global plutocracy. 

I think the only way to stop it would be to create a union of socialist states, for the problems are inherent to capitalism, as the profit motive always encourages businesses to lower their operating costs (for if they don't they are just outcompeted by more ruthless businesses that will).

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"Because a large group of people who don't speak your language well if at all, who share a radically different culture to yours, and who don't mix with your group always creates tensions. Humans are strange animals, we are hard-wired to form groups and tribes, and to distrust others from different tribes. Just look at the tensions between people who share the same culture, same language from a similar range of economic backgrounds who simply have different political views, as expressed openly in /r/ukpolitics for example.

Very liberal immigration policy's failed to take this into account, instead choosing to believe that people will automatically gel together. Which might have happened once, but with today's cheap air travel, global real time communication and mass immigration the planet is much smaller. You aren't as cut off from your original culture as you once were, which means that the pressure to integrate and adapt to the culture your now living is is far less. You can get away with not learning English, not learning about how British society works and not mixing with the native population, because there are in some areas pretty much a critical mass of non-native populations. 

So why does this cause tension? Because we're not built to work in this environment. Britain has had an isolated, immobile population for thousands of years now, it is quite possible to find people who have ancestors in a particular area that stretch back hundreds of years, if not thousands of years. If you then transplant a completely alien population into the middle of that, and it is a population that is large enough to have a significant downward force on the need to adapt and integrate, then the old hard-wired instincts of us and them come back into play. If this happens in a poor area, then the end result is the BNP or EDL.

So no, I don't think its racism (hating people because of their race), I think the problems are cultural. Liberal immigration policy hasn't properly dealt with the need for immigrants to adapt and integrate with the locals properly. In fact, it has tended to ignore the problem entirely. So to counter this, we need to dramatically slow down the rate of immigration and work more on integration. We also need to spread immigration around a little, as some areas are very skewed to non-native populations. Things like council leaflets being printed in multiple languages needs to stop, with more emphasis on new arrivals being able to learn written and spoken English.

alling your critique of NESV's purchase of Liverpool FC innacurate would be giving it too much credit. To be inaccurate, it would have to present false facts- instead, it simply presents your opinions. Incredibly ignorant opinions.

High-profile players won't come? LFC has one of the most coveted strikers in the world in Fernando Torres. England International Joe Cole just signed this summer, when he had his choice of Champions League-bound clubs beckoning. Liverpool is a legendary franchise, even at its lowest point, and it will always draw talent.

As for your accusations of 'one management template for all,' you're dead wrong. Henry has openly said that his tactics used for the Boston Red Sox might not apply to English Football, and he's appointing people to decide the best way forward. For the first time in its history, the club has a Director of Football, whose job it is to determine transfer targets and plan long-term strategy. Henry's modesty is refreshing- would you prefer another Mike Ashley, who makes wanton gut decisions against the advice of any sane experts?  

The rest of your rant about the supposedly insane fanbase isn't even worth addressing, but if you think it's extreme or crazy to maintain a boycott of a paper that profited from slanderous headlines, exploiting the dead in a tight-knit community, then you're just a piece of trash.

Four's personality was very different. He cut most ties with UNIT pretty quickly and went off to treat the universe ""Like a giant pinball game"" as Five would later put it. I think that the end of Four was when the Doctor's soul started to really get complex and a bit weary and Five's personality was a reaction to that; both growing up (far less reckless, far more compassionate) and trying to be more youthful (the first example of the Doctor looking a great deal younger after a regeneration than his previous body). Five's straight heroics and piousness was an overcorrection of Four's manic personality and recklessness and the end result of this dichotomy (combined with the fact that 5-&gt;6's regen was a result of a very toxic poison) resulted in Six's borderline psychotic personality with a HUGE ego (Five was the least egotistical Doctor, Six was the most egotistical Doctor.) By the time Seven rolls around the Doctor has accepted his larger role in the cosmos and is a master strategist and manipulator with a very comical side as well.

you're ignoring things like the salaries of all the people that work for the housing council, and I'm sure the council is receiving money from the government as well, which means the rents aren't covering the bills right?

regardless, it may not be money going into the people's pockets (a handout in the most literal of senses), but it is less money coming out of their pockets, for one of our most basic needs.  You may not see that as a handout, but I do.

and really, don't get me wrong, I'm not against council housing/section 8, nor welfare for people, again, my original comment was more to the fact that people shouldn't blame government for other people's lack of personal responsibility.

in regards to schooling, it's the parents personal responsibility to ensure that their children are motivated and encouraged to do well in school, if not to pull themselves out of being poor, to at the very least be somewhat likely to be a contributing member of society.

I think it's quite common for citizens to look at school scores and lay the foot of the blame at the government for not providing enough money, and not doing more to ensure their kids are better educated, all the while not engaging their kids when they get home (from school or work, depending on what homelife is) and making sure their kids are applying themselves.

Ok, people would be earning twice what they were but what's the point when everything you buy has also gone up in price by 100%?

true,CraigTorso,cnty-uk,null,"I'm not ignoring the costs of managing the properties, I include them under maintenance, though I suppose I should have included ""administration"" in there for completeness, but the general point holds.  

Historically, people haven't been home owners in the UK, everyone except the merchant class and above have historically rented, or been provided accommodation related to their job.  Going back to feudal times, everyone was provided with a property on their Lord's estate.  With the industrial revolution and associated urbanisation, everyone who moved into the city was expected to rent from a private (and often slum) landlord, unless they were lucky enough to work for a Quaker or similarly enlightened employer, who provided them accommodation.  This is pretty much how things continued until WW2. 

After WW2, in part because the German bombing had destroyed so much urban housing stock, the government launched a building campaign to move people out of the privately owned slums and into nicer council owned properties.  The rents that were charged were, in part as a reaction to the excesses of private landlords, regarded as fair rents, and have remained so.  This is a good thing.  

The real problem isn't that there are people getting fairly cheap council owned houses to live in, so much as that the daft growth in home ownership on the premise that property is an investment that always increases in value, has robbed the remainder of the population of affordable housing, and tied them into the whims of a money market they have no influence over.

And here ends the heavily abridged history of UK housing policy.
