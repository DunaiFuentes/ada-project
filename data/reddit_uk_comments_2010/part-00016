X-files didn't survive the transition. The first film seemed like a poorly scripted episode and would have been better spanned as a season finale - bridging over to a season opener. With the second film - it just seemed like a filler mid season episode. 

I don't want this happening to the Doctor. Small screen Sci Fi should remain as such - SMALL SCREEN! Cinema doesn't seem to have the same impact that television does.

The other thing is, the implication that we're given is that the Time War took out Time Lords in **all** universes. Otherwise we'dve seen them by now (or other-otherwise, expect them in a future season (or other-other-otherwise, we'd have seen a parallel Doctor by now)).

The ""Doctor Who"" stories are not written by specialists in cosmology(^); hence, we have frequently conflicting models of how multi-space-time works in ""Doctor Who"". I mean... do all parallel universes exist, or do parallel universe **come into being** only when a time traveller disrupts history? Do those parallel universes come into being *just by a time traveller arriving*, or is there some ""quantumised"" ""coherency-of-state"" which lumps ""identical-but-for-a-few-atoms"" universes into one; divided, separated and quantified by some quantum?

(See, this is why I've been harping on continuity, consistency and the application of just some internal story logic to these episodes. Yes, I love me the continuity.)

Not to mention... wouldn't it be **awesome**, wouldn't it, if just for once: we could have a hard-science story, rather than ""kiss the girl and defeat the alien technology just by being human and thinking at it"" story? Please, pretty please, pretty ***please***?

Why does ""Doctor Who for adults"" just have to be ""Torchwood with humans and aliens bangin' uglies""? Why can't we have some ""people with IQs below 90 may want to switch to the local footy""? Why can't we have something that engages the **mind** rather than tug-at-the-heartstrings? *Pretty pleeeease?*

There's some serious BS going on in more than a few episodes, and a lot of nonsensical ""now why would they do THAT?"" moments... but overall the high-concept stuff is sound.

I would also argue that the ""hardness"" has been out the window for a **long** time.

&gt; As long as their logic generally remains consistent (the sonic screwdriver doesn't work on organic material, except indirectly. Why? Who cares...)

But it's **not** and there's what finally drove me to post about it here.

I mean, sparky-Blinovitch screwdrivers. Fine. Why didn't Amy do a Brigadier and spark-out?

If the universe *and everyone in it* was **recreated** without a Doctor, does that mean that the Doctor is now the only survivor of a parallel-preceding universe?

And how the hell did the River-who-was-recreated remember a Doctor **who never existed**?

&gt; There's some serious BS going on in more than a few episodes, and a lot of nonsensical ""now why would they do THAT?"" moments...

... *hence my postings*.

&gt; but overall the high-concept stuff is sound

Moderately, yes. Don't deny that. But the *execution* is **worse** than tarnishing. It's *corrosive*.

&gt; Not to mention the most recent season, which I won't spoil

Seen it. Done it. Spoiler tags are good, too.

&gt; the TARDIS' connection to all of our universe's spacetime (and its sentient nature)

... has been covered in much more detail and much more fully in tween-series books. Encourage you to read them, some are **very** good value.

&gt; bill-and-ted style closed time loops

**No**. That's the ***best*** example of the stuff that's metaphorically killing me and making me wonder if it's not time to sell the collection.

Ironically, it's early ""Doctor Who"" which got me interested in science&amp;technology in general; not to mention science-fiction and the philosophy of time travel. It's that very first ""Doctor Who"" inspiration that's making the watching of 2005-2010 ""Doctor Who"" so painful.

That ""closed loop"" is ***[paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_paradox)***. That's what finally made me go ""aargh, can't take it anymore, must post to Reddit"".

&gt; alternate timelines (everyone knows there are no such things as stars)

Oh, yes. It was absolutely lovely. It's just that, taken to its conclusion, it goes and undoes the single second-best thing Russell Davies ever did - undoing all that ""multiple parallel universes"" stuff he **introduced in the first place**.

&gt; Compare even the worst Doctor Who episode with any Star Trek time travel episode, and DW wins by a long shot.  

**Not any more**; *hence my pain*.

&gt; DW avoids the complicated explanations ('timey-wimey wibbley-wobbley!')

Even ""SG-1"" managed to surf over those. And sadly, ""SG-1""'s overall consistency has become better than ""Doctor Who""'s.

&gt; and I feel it's much better for it.

It must be a matter of taste. Because we've seen the same episodes (maybe I just better remember old episodes and the tween-series stuff)... and I feel very, *very*, **very** differently.

It'd be hard to replace Hartnell, especially given the sort of lack of older actors in Hollywood. Hopkins could probably bring something to the role, as could Robin Williams, if he could get out of his normal manic stage and into something a bit more...grumpy. John Malkovich can certainly play both the grumpy old, alien man and the happy grandfather figure, so he would be a good, mainstream choice for the role. The obvious choice for the role would be Sean Connery, but I fear that it would simply be too obvious. My personal choice for the role would be someone like Liam Neeson, or Alan Rickman. Both could play the grumpy asshole that Hartnell introduced us to and made us love.

For a newer, hipper Doctor Who movie, that might be tricky to cast. Johnny Depp, is again, fairly obvious, being fairly acrobatic in his acting, when given a script that works properly, and could prove to be a truly gifted Doctor. You could also coax out great performances from the likes of Nick Cage, who's sort of weird, manic, slightly awkward energy could really play to the strength of the new Doctor. Jim Carry, to me, lacks the ability to play to the serious and dark nature of the doctors. 

For a TV show, or even a lighter-hearted movie... I would love to see Adam Scott in the role. He's a great comedic actor, obviously, and I think he might be interesting in the roll.

true,Kiram,mcgann,McGann,"I feel like this is disingenuous at best. More than once, Moffat has shown the propensity for the exact opposite sort of story-telling. Where as quite often, RTD was very ""tech the tech and then we win."" (For example...every single series finale. The Time Vortex at the end of S1, the sucking thing at the end of S2, the magic doctor chant at the end of S3, and even the big finale at the end of S4. The mini-season ending, while awesome, was also very ""Doctor points the Sonic Screwdriver at something, and then he wins."" sort of thing. And it has happened a million times before. Previously unexplored/unmentioned areas of technology suddenly existing and saving the day, with a little help from the doctor.)

Compare this to Moffat. Sure, sometimes he tech's the tech, but more often, I have seen bits mentioned, at least, so that the viewer can piece together the ending before the doctor does it. It makes sense, even if it is fantastic.

A perfect example was in the finale of the Angel two-parter. At the very beginning of the episode, two minor things were established. First, they were hanging from the ceiling, essentially, due to the artificial gravity of the ship. Second, the angels constantly drained power from electrical things. So, then, it really came as no surprise when these two things collided, and the ships gravity failed. I honestly felt like a fool for not having seen it coming.

The same thing happened in the Finale. Sure, it was fairly magical that Amy's remembering the Doctor could bring him back to life suddenly. But it was quite clearly established in the episode before it happened. He told her it would happen. He just didn't mention that it would happen to him as well.

I feel that Moffat has more than proved his ability to at least telegraph the magic in the ending. Sure, he sometimes conjures magical powers and such, but he always tells you what the magic is before it's vital. Which, in my opinion, makes the Doctor feel way, way smarter. Because, to be honest, I don't feel like the doctor is smart when he tells me that the technology works in this way and if he just does... -this- then, viola, the day is saved! But when he puts the dots together that were introduced earlier in the show, or even in the series? Then he feels smart. Smarter than me, because I missed it.

I really don't want to go down the road of Amy = River as that theory has been discussed and debunked to death. I do think that there is a valid connection between the two. A couple of ideas about who River really is off the top of my head are:

* River is Amy and Rory's daughter/granddaughter

* River is Gallifreyan under the influence of the chameleon arch.

* River is Half Gallifreyan, half Human.

And one of my personal favorites

* River is the Goddess Isis, a lost alien (possibly even time lord) who landed in ancient Rome, regenerated into Cleopatra, and eventually River Song. Remember the Christmas episode will be about a Egyptian Goddess. River also pretended to be Cleopatra and Cleopatra believed that she was the reincarnation of Isis.

Obviously it's lower budget and a bit simplistic on the dialogue and the violence, but it's not too far from old, campier Doctor Who.  If I had a particular complaint, it's that in Doctor Who, when you don't know what's going on and suddenly all the clues fall into place, The Doctor suddenly explains (most) everything, and it's believable, because The Doctor is brilliant and he knows stuff.  In SJA, a similar leap has to be made in an episode, only it's the children or Sarah Jane who has to come up with it, and often it simply isn't convincing; it's guesswork.

Also, one wonders, if The Doctor is the one supposedly protecting Earth all the time, why he's not aware of the near-weekly threats being stopped by Sarah Jane, Torchwood, UNIT, and who knows who else.

So she was already planning on going home.  Then of course she gets stuck on four more adventures.

At the end of The Hand of Fear, she starts whining about wanting a bath and whatnot.  The Doctor pretty much ignores her and she packs her backs in a tiff.

Now even if she was 'just joking' as she states in that scene it serves her right for acting like a petty little girl.  

But either way, as a wise man once said, ""In every lie there is a kernel of truth"".  Sarah is conflicted...she wants to go home, but at the same time she wants to stay with the Doctor.  It was only the call to Gallifrey that tipped the scales.

Moffat put two paradoxes into the episode. One was the key to the Doctor's escape. The other was just because Amelia Pond was thirsty. The only resolution to a paradox is to have multiple universes created *by* the paradox.

That, plus the different ways ""Doctor Who"" has handled the way space-time works... *not to mention* the chaos that happened in the tween-series books?

&gt; Britain’s Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition has announced public spending cuts that are possibly the most savage in Europe.

Well, except for Ireland, Greece, Spain, Portugal and (coming soon) Italy. It's also worth mentioning that the cuts break down as 4% of GDP from Labour and 2% of GDP from the current coalition. ([source](http://www.economist.com/node/16439052))


&gt; VAT has been increased from 17.5 percent to 20 percent,

No it hasn't. It is planned for January next year but only if certain conditions are met.

&gt; given that austerity measures are part of a global process that is plunging the UK and the world economy into a second round of recession deeper than that which began in 2008

Wait, what!? Who (apart from these clowns) said the UK was still in recession?

&gt; The most vulnerable are being targeted by cuts to Housing Benefit and a campaign to drive at least half a million off Incapacity Benefit through a stepped-up regime of “fitness to work” tests.

I always wonder if the student they have in this week to write this drivel actually really thinks that they're thinking is: ""How can we design a tax or cuts system which specifically targets the weak, needy or vulnerable?"" As if the people in the civil service and government were cartoon super-villans from The Venture Bros.

&gt; This is nothing less than a declaration of war against working people on behalf of the corporate elite

No, you see it's not. That's just childish. And where did we seamlessly flip from condemning the government to condemning the private sector?

Pfft. The article is condemning the fact that (almost) all parts of the UK are pulling together to get us out of the hole we're in. That's a bit dim.

I liked David Tennant's Doctor, (although watching The End of Time almost made me dislike him),  but there's something about Smith's Doctor that really shows off the 900 year old man in a younger mans body, who just happens to be a time travelling alien. I genuinely believe Smith's acting is excellent. Especially in the finale, when he starts going back on his own time stream. He goes from comedic (""I can buy a fez""), to pleading for his existence (""You have to remember what I told you when you were seven"") to a resigned acceptance of his fate while talking to the young Amelia- when he calls himself ""silly old Doctor"", you really believe this 27 year old actor is playing a tired 900+ year old man.

It seems that this incarnation of the Doctor has recovered from the post-traumatic trauma that so affected 9 and the verging on emo whining that followed 10 around at times. He's moving on, and in a way is being a bit more like some of the older doctors, but in a way that is unique in what Matt Smith brings to the role.

I thought the finale made perfect sense, from both the internal logic of time travel within the show and from the hints about the nature of the cracks dropped throughout the season. Yes there was travelling into your own timeline happening but a) it's not the first time this has happened-the doctor has met himself several different times (The Two Doctors,The Three Doctors, The Five Doctors, Timecrash) and b)the threads of reality holding the Universe together were quickly unwinding, so a bending of the rules of the Universe is understandable.

I like Amy. The actress playing her isn't as strong an actor as Matt Smith, but I like the character of Amy. They've at least made for some character development, and she's not just there to be the damsel in distress all the time-she can occasionally come up with the solution to a  problem.  She's better with Rory though- I think it's their relationship that makes the two of them more interesting then they would be on their own.

I'd even have to disagree with your choice of 10th Doctor episode. 'Gridlock' was mediocre at best...Father Dougal in a cat suit?

Edit; been thinking about that last bit. My parents knew I lost her, but still let me take her out again. They knew damn well it would not happen again and we had learned our lessson. So I'm withdrawing my ambivalence. The parents have assessed the risks, let them get on with it.

Edit2: That is not to say that my parents should not have been reported otherwise, but they would have middle-classed their way out of it.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; The UK has a lower murder rate than Canada, where guns are legal.

Canada doesn't have the same cultural issues with drink &amp; random violence. That's my point, despite the greater violence, *murders* are lower. Guns massively lower the bar on the ability to kill, far moreso than a knife. You need to be a determined son of a bitch to get up close and stab someone. To actually kill you need to hit a certain area and get stabby; it's rare a single blow is fatal. Shooting them can be done at arms length, will cause massive internal damage and you probably won't even see any blood, let alone get it all over your hands. 

&gt;     in the state of Maryland the murder rate increased 20% since new gun laws were introduced in 1986

To be honest you cannot compare the two countries like this. Canada has a huge porous border with a country that is awash with firearms. I've never advocated complete gun control in North America because it's unworkable. Any criminal can trivially get a gun. Even if the US and Canada simultaneously changed the law it wouldn't matter because there are so many guns in circulation already. Things are very different in the island that is the UK. It is actually possible to restrict firearms coming into the country and we don't have a history of handgun ownership\*. When was the last time you heard of petty crime like robbery being conducted at gun point in the UK? The only people with access to firearms are career criminals, predominately class-A drug dealers, where their other crimes completely overshadow having an illegal firearm. For your basic criminal that Joe Public needs to fear, having a gun is a far more severe crime than random assaults and robberies. It doesn't make sense for them to carry one. I'd prefer that the crack dealers didn't have guns, but those that do aren't gonna bother me because I don't deal in crack cocaine. 

\* shotguns and rifles are legal with a license in the UK BTW, it's just handguns and automatic rifles that are completely banned. ",0,1278264637,null,0,false,0,c0ti4hy,t3_clt7s,t1_c0ti4hy,t1_c0ti26k,null,1426366639,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Various torrents have been floating around for a while with episodes in a variety of qualities.  A lot of the video in these is taken from VHS transfers, as the DVD releases for several stories didn't exist (and, for many, still doesn't) at the time the torrent was compiled.

If you ever attend a science fiction convention of any size, you'll probably stumble across a booth that sells DVDs of shows which aren't normally available on DVD.  This is pretty much the same content as the torrent files, but assembled together with interactive menus.  The video quality isn't generally up to retail quality.

At present, some 60-ish stories haven't yet been released on DVD.  Of those, 26 are missing one or more episode from the BBC archives.  The BBC has been releasing the DVDs at a rate of about 1 story per month since about 2005 - about 30 had been released from 1999 to 2004.  So far, the releases have been in essentially random order.  The official plan is to have the classic series releases completed by sometime in 2012 - the BBC hasn't clarified how it will handle the ""missing"" episodes, although they previously released the Pat Troughton story *The Invasion* in partially animated format, so they may use a similar approach for other stories.

The People tended to be small-minded and conservative and not very clever and were even distrustful of cleverness.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; More than once, Moffat has shown the propensity for the exact opposite sort of story-telling. Where as quite often, RTD was very ""tech the tech and then we win."" (For example...every single series finale

And Moffat, on the other hand, decided that ""oh, it's a paradox, let's more on"" is much better.

I can see what you're so impressed with the Doctor escaping the inescapable box by being outside and letting himself out.

At absolute best, this is up to the fine standard set by RTD.

&gt; I feel that Moffat has more than proved his ability to at least telegraph the magic in the ending.

Even RTD could start a two-parter by saying ""paradox machine"" and surprise everyone by having it clean up the paradox. Again, I can see why Moffat is so superior.

&gt; The same thing happened in the Finale. Sure, it was fairly magical that Amy's remembering the Doctor could bring him back to life suddenly. But it was quite clearly established in the episode before it happened. He told her it would happen. He just didn't mention that it would happen to him as well.

When RTD has magic, he has 15 satellites in orbit creating a psychic net, when Moffat has magic, he has a girl remember the doctor back into existence because, hey, look, paradox!

Now, while I can understand that RTD's magic bothers many people, given a choice between ""tech the tech and the tech has always been integral to the villains character and was mentioned repeatedly"" and the ""oh, it's magic, carry on"" approaches, I'm not entirely convinced that the church of Moffat the God Of Who is quite right.

The only RFID implementation I really know of is on license plate registration stickers in certain states. My uncle is a police Lieutenant in New York and he told me that they've implemented RFID chips into those and, with a quick scan after pulling someone over, they can pull up all sorts of information on the driver (or at least whoever owns the car). He wouldn't go into more detail than that though because he told me it was pretty confidential since it's brand new. 

In any event if you have the right credentials there isn't much electronic verification, at least not yet. Maybe to get into the Pentagon you'd have to have your thumb scanned if it was a highly sensitive area but in most situations if people see the right identification they don't really question it if it looks exactly genuine. 

Not to mention people don't carry around RFID scanners and electronic verification tools with them for ID cards if you were in a situation outside of getting into a stationed position like a door to a research lab or something.

But in all seriousness, I think that Demonoid torrent does actually have a lot of episodes that aren't on DVD yet.  I haven't finished Hartnell yet because I'm a math major with no extra time during the summer term (21 math summer credits makes me cry tears of blood), but I've seen one or two episodes with lines in it akin to VHS scanning lines that you don't see in professional restorations. Funny that; you get more episodes by not actually paying for it.

Honestly they didn't. Britain has *never* been a pro-gun ownership community. It's just not a part of the culture here. Until recent years the only handguns you ever heard of were ""service revolvers"" from WW2. When handguns were banned following a horrific school shooting there really weren't all that many enthusiasts who lost out. It's just not a popular pasttime; I've never even fired a gun despite the fact that .22 rifles &amp; shotguns are legal and occasionally found in country fairs and corporate days out. The UK doesn't have the whole ""homesteading"" history of the US, we've always had policemen to call upon when needed, no one has ever needed to defend their range. Those times ended here in the days of swords.

&gt; we have opium based drugs for a good couple of hundred years 

Which were legal and controlled &amp; distributed globally by the British Empire. We went to war over it and believe me there was just as much violence, except it was nation-based and far away (Afghanistan and China mostly). Modern drug dealers might fire a few random shots into the homes of their rivals; we sent our army over to slaughter and systematically destroy all of China's Buddhist Temples that we could find. 

&gt; do you really think that the black market will stop getting guns if we stop all

Not entirely, but it's more than ""good enough"" so that regular citizens like me need not fear an assailant with a gun. If I were robbed at gunpoint the criminal would be in far greater legal trouble because of their gun. It would be insane for any street thug / home invader to have firearms when that crime itself is far more severe. If caught in the act they will get an armed response squad on their ass and they don't mess about. 

&gt; we can start using education to change the opinions of peole.

Agreed, but looking towards the US, they don't seem to be doing too well with this approach. Kids find and use their parents guns all of the time. The basic street hood is usually packing. The predominant shooting stance these days is the right-angled hip-hop nonsense. How do you propose to change popular culture? The pro-violence movement is massive, from Hollywood movies thru music and onto computer games. None of these are teaching responsible ownership.

As someone who runs an independent dance label I will say that if anything get rid of radio one, or at least reinvent it and get rid of the people who create those playlists and the pluggers who you have to pay a fortune to just to get anywhere near the place, the whole system has become corrupt ( mostly by Simon Cowell, 19 management and various others who have monopolised this station ) their take on music is basically abysmal homogenised, paint by numbers, chicken in a basket crap

This is not just me saying this either, all my label owning peers say the same thing, you get great acts like the Stanton Warriors, the Plump DJ's  the Freestylers etc. etc. who can't get near radio one drive time even though they are capable and often do top every dance chart and independent radio chart in the country. What is that about? 

I was toying with the idea of using one of these pluggers last year, so I set up a meeting, it was going to cost me £6000 for this guy to drop one of our tunes into a radio one pigeon hole for one producer to hear it, with a few follow up calls and no guarantee that this producer would ever listen to the tune in the first place. And then the guy says to me: but it'll have to sound like this though as he played me ( from his mobile phone ) the shittiest, thin sounding, autotuned vocal pop tune I've ever heard in my life, so I'm like: Why does it have to sound like that?

Fuck me. This needs to stop. Radio one used to be brilliant, it's terrible nowadays. This is why.

As my mate is fond of saying: "" Kids will get used to and eventually like whatever is spoon fed to them musically as long as it's bright, shiny, plastic and they've heard it before. "" That sums up Radio one perfectly, bright shiny, plastic and we've most definitely heard it before. 

Personally I couldn't give a shit about this station I never listen to it anyway, apart from one fact: To really break an artist in the UK, 9 times out of 10 you need to have Radio one plays, it's as simple as that.

a quote from Prof Glaister, rather a silly one, nothing in their proposals acctually stops the petrol stations from not increasing their prices. Pretty much every increase we've seen in fuel price over the last however many years isn't an increase in fuel duty - that only comes about after the budget - its oil companies charging more per barrel. Removing the fuel duty completely would only produce a one-time big reduction in fuel cost, then that new price would begin to increase. Not only that but we assume petrol stations would reduce their fuel prices after fuel duty is done away with and not continue to charge what they do now but reap a massively increased profit margin",0,1278330845,null,0,false,0,c0tjnwo,t3_cm2ru,t1_c0tjnwo,t3_cm2ru,null,1426367357,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Nope. Amy only escapes from the dream world because she thinks a world in which Rory isn't alive isn't one worth living in. That wasn't the solution, it was just the Doctor going along with Amy's suicidal desires.

I *do* think that the only one on the list that actually is a rather big issue is the final one. Which is probably why it was left as the final one on the list.

&gt;**The Doctor tells scary aliens to go away.**

Specifically because they post a picture of *The Pandorica Opens*, as I've said before, that's why I like that speech: it's a perfect juxtaposition to what comes later. The Doctor assuming they're disapparate forces, but they're not. It's not boasting, as they suggest, it's psychological warfare.

I'd justify that *The Eleventh Hour* needed it, because it was essentially another starting off point for new viewers.



&gt;**Someone stops a deadly machine by admitting to their true feelings.**

Hahah, that one gets on my nerves. It was a lovely moment with Amy and Bracewell, but did not make one ounce of sense.



&gt;**Deadly and unknowable aliens use a dead humans's lingering remains to communicate.**

How can it be overused if it's popped up twice? I know they're saying it *could* be overused, but they've admitted it's not yet. So I take pedantic objection to including that.



&gt;**A little girl is trapped in an unreal world where she's the only one who can touch reality.** 

Again, twice is overused? And it's not just Amelia that remembers the real worlds, there was the aside of Star Cults, so I would hazard that others that lived near cracks experienced similar things to Amy.



&gt;**A little girl meets the Doctor, and then she sees him again as an adult, but it's only been a few minutes for him.**

Ehhhhh, I think this one is also stretching it. It was an excellent way of introducing Amy because it gave her some attachment to him, enough to justify becoming the new Companion, and not someone he picks up along the way because they shared an Alien Attack Moment. And to some extent from him to her. He feels a responsibility because he didn't take five minutes and has to make up for it.

That and it was funny.

&gt;Moffat is still one of the most clever writers ever to have handled Doctor Who.

true,[deleted],null,null,"**I bought the Eccleston/Tennant screwdriver from this guy...anything you'd like to know specifically, or do you just want my thoughts on it?

Just a heads up:  I had it for about three days and I had to send it back because it got knocked around in shipping and had a loose wire to the microcontroller thingy, but I definitely remember a lot about it...I should be getting it back in a week or two (since it's shipped from China).**

**edit:** Just a summary of the stuff I recall from it:

The paint job is absolutely superb and something that must have had a lot of effort put into duplicating, it's like it's got a layer or two of paint below the top layer that shows between the 'cracks'.  It's textured and gives a good grip.

The machining is *really* impressive, the only deformity I could find is on the 'teeth' where the head and handle join together when it's retracted...they aren't perfectly straight if you look very closely, IIRC...***but***, considering that this is made with CNC and how accurate the rest of it is, there's a good chance that this is just an artifact left over from the original prop (which the guy apparently had access to).  **(**Keep in mind that there wasn't just one prop for any screwdriver: the first model from Eccleston/Tennant was notorious for breaking, so there were many handmade models which I'm assuming had some imperfections and abnormalities.**)**

It has a good weight to it, but still feels a little lighter than you might expect.  Some parts of the steel had to be milled very thin (especially the threaded areas) to keep true to the original dimensions.  Also, the clear ""column"" is acrylic, which weighs next to nothing.

The sound is screen accurate.  I don't think it's the actual source sound, but I can't really tell the difference (and I've got damn-near perfect pitch).  It's also a bit louder than I expected...I thought the sound especially would be a let down because (IIRC) the production team puts the sound in after the scene is shot.  It's close enough that I can't tell the difference and I have no complaints with it.  Also, this is more of the 'neutral' sound...the sound varied according to what it was doing in the scene (sometimes it would sound high-pitched like it was 'working'), but this sound is just the regular one.

The light looks accurate.

This part might just be nitpicking...the sliding action could be improved.  I talked to him about it seeming a little 'loose'...it can extend with a *really* light touch.  Apparently it's damn-near impossible to do much about it because of the dimensions...the space requirements make everything such a tight fit that the only thing you could really do is put a small piece of tape on the inside to make it a bit more snug...but when mine gets shipped back I'll be seeing what I can do to give it a bit of resistance (maybe a strip of short felt around the battery compartment?).

And since I'm nitpicking, one thing that seems overlooked was that everything is threaded without anything like loctite to keep them in place.  The threads aren't really loose, but if you aren't careful and you're handling it all day they can untwist themselves.  I didn't have it for too long, but maybe it could be remedied by simply tightening them a little more...we shall see (maybe a tiny bit of loctite would help?).  The only time I really handled it was after it was in from shipping, and it was knocked around bad enough that I had to send it back because of a loose wire (this was true of the props also), so **it's likely that they just got enough vibration en route from Chine to the states that they came a little loose...and they didn't come loose after I tightened them back up.**

(More nitpicking) The acrylic column is the softer type that can scratch/scuff if you aren't careful (there are two types of acrylic, one is softer and scratches, the other is called 'cell cast acrylic' and is very durable).  I'm not sure of the comparative production costs between the two arylics, but judging by the rest of the quality of the screwdriver, I'd say the cell cast must be difficult or expensive for the maker to obtain.

**TL;DR:**

Uhh let's see...I can't think of anything else.  I mean, it's really great, I'm especially impressed that he got the sound and light almost dead-on...this guy has a real eye/ear for detail.  The minor issues with it (soft acrylic and the loose action) are due more to the dimensions of the original prop and the accompanying space limitations internally than the guy who made it.

I don't think he's making a BS claim with the 7 microns, either.  If you look the 10th-11th doctor model, it's only within a mm of tolerance, so at least he's upfront.

People queue at the postoffice but only because there is a system where you have to get a ticket for the service you want and they call you up '235a to counter b' and even then, rudeness comes into play because there is no concept of being quick so that people behind you can do their stuff.

* Develop a ""don't mess with me"" facial expression which you will use whenever you walk down the street, especially in areas like Stockwell
* Become completely paranoid about parking, and learn to FUCKING HATE TRAFFIC WARDENS
* When on the tube, get generally pissed off at tourists who do things like stand in the door looking at their map
* NEVER talk to anybody on the bus, tube or train. If they talk to you, look alarmed and answer monosyllabically
* Every Thursday night after work, go to a pub with your work colleagues and stand around in a circle talking about work while getting steadily pissed up on Amstel or some other shit lager that your boss has bought for you
* At the end of the night, go home with one of the drunk admin girls
* In fact, this describes the English dating routine quite well: alcohol -&gt; sex -&gt; awkwardness -&gt; apology dinner -&gt; marriage
* Get a job a long way from your home that requires you to be stuffed like a sardine into a tube, bus or train for at least 45 minutes each way
* Develop an automatic disdain for all things German and French
* Develop an assumption that all Americans are fat and stupid (sorry, but you have to do this if you want to be English)
* Eat a dodgy doner kebab at the end of the night every Friday and Saturday
* Learn to love football, and start supporting Manchester United (most Londoners do)

true,ucbmckee,english,England,"As an American living in London, I might offer these suggestions beyond what has already been mentioned:

* Pay twice as much for everything, relative to even New York prices, and take it in stride

* Smoke like a chimney and make sure that everybody you know does the same

* Affect a deep concern for the environment, whilst having no real global influence on the problem

* If you work as a bureaucrat, make sure you follow every rule to perfection. Even if it involves digging through the archives to make sure you got them all.

* Always be polite (if you're not following the chavvy, Harry Brown, This is England, etc. advice below)

* Have a pint on the way to work. Have another couple for lunch. Toss back another set after work. Basically, drink copiously (although don't necessarily get pissed), regardless of time or work.

* When you go on holiday, you're only allowed to go to beach resorts already teeming with other Brits. Making sure to find a resort area where most of the restaurants proudly advertise the quality of their Full English, because you don't really want to try any of that foreign rubbish, even if you're in Egypt, Turkey, Morocco, etc. Bonus points if it's an all inclusive with drink benefits, where you never have to leave the pool. 

* If you run a business, make sure to close by 10pm, even if you're a restaurant, pub, etc. Even in the heart of a big city. And don't open at all on Sunday, or only open for a few inconvenient hours. If a customer can't get their business sorted by a reasonable hour, sod the uncivilized twat.


(This is meant a bit tongue-in-cheek, although the above traits are certainly far more common than in the US. In general, you can see cultural differences between spots in the US that are as or more significant as between the US and UK (and similar large differences even within the UK). Aside from picking up a few new pieces of vocabulary, there's really no culture shock in the transition.)

The problem was that some people who were intellectually able were not going to university because it was just 'not the done thing' in their environment.

To try to fix it, the government massively opened up the universities and pushed the idea that a degree would guarantee you a stable job.

Of course, it did benefit those that might not necessarily have gone to university but it did not benefit and *actually hindered* those that should not have gone to university.

The latter people now suffer from extraordinary debts and possess a shit degree that has done nothing to help them in life because there are thousands of people in the same position as they are. For example, the number of jobs in the media industry are outnumbered by the number of degree places available in universities by a factor of 42:1.

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"There's plenty of good advice here already about living in London, so I'll just add a few specifics in case you choose to live in the North.

1. Adopt Northern Nationalism. If it's from the South, it's flouncy, self important and lacks gumption. Always remind Southerners of this at every available opportunity.
2. Try not to be terrified by people being very upfront with you. Unlike London where speaking to a stranger is much like getting your dick out in public, it's very much the norm in the North. Also, any form of conversation will be delivered in an accent that sounds like a declaration of war. This is the default position for Northerners and does not mean that the outbreak of hostilities are imminent.
3. If in doubt, blame Margaret Thatcher.
4. Never accuse a Northerner of being eccentric. Even though they regularly are (Yorkshire folk in particularly), they like to think they are straight forward/honest to god/salts of the earth who call a spade a spade and take no nonsense. Stay safe and induldge their fantasy.
5. Asking for Earl Grey tea will result in bemusement and/or ridicule.
6. A night out in Manchester will probably result in a trip to A and E.
7. Finally, a small piece of advice that applies nationwide: Never, repeat NEVER, drink in a pub with a flat roof. They are nearly always the roughest spots in any given area and tend to treat anything new/novel/exotic with physical violence. This rule is doubly true if there is a German Shepherd sitting on the flat roof.

* People from between Derby and Warwick claim to be *Midlanders*, eschewing the obvious bipolarity of England. They are wrong, they're nothing more than common Northerners.

The top three (in no particular order) are:

* Drink **tea**. If you're a builder, somewhere in the region of eight to ten sugars are required to be included. If posh, Earl Grey is the future.
* Drink **lager** or **beer**. If you're a *lager lout*, you'll enjoy the watery insipidity of *lager*, a drink brewed from water and little else. If you're an *old bastard*, you'll prefer beer (ale), which has the taste and consistency of dishwater.
* **Queue**. Queue even if you don't want what's at the other end. Queue with dignity and pride that you and your countrymen are the best at something more positive than teenage parents or alcoholism. If anyone queue jumps, stare at them with the heat and anger of a thousand Suns, but *don't say anything*.

It's true that by not having a computer science degree, I tend to arrive at the theory back to front. I discovered mergesort before I knew of binary search, for example. I am certain there are still areas that I don't know as deeply as someone who really studied hard in their CS degree.

At the moment this is the case, yes. It looks like it will change in the future though - either moving to a graduate tax, market-level interest on the loans or simply higher amounts.

* If you speak up about a solution to a problem that seems obvious to you ('while he's got the scaffolding up, why dont you ask the guy next door who's getting his roof done, to look at your dripping gutter that we're always complaining about?'), you'll get a mumbled reply along the lines of 'sounds like a good idea...' but nothing will actually come of it
* everyone will complain about chavs and yobs and troubled youth, but no one will actually do anything about them (watch the recent Michael Caine move 'Harry Brown' to see what I mean)
* everything is WAY EXPENSIVE here - Gas? $7 per (US) gallon, please. Milk? $3.50 per (US) gallon. Eggs? $1.50 a dozen. (YMMV depending where you are in the US of course)
* the NHS is awesome - sick? call up your doctor and go visit. No charge. Emergency visit? No charge. Helicopter recovery from a mountain road accident? No charge. 
* you know the regional variations like accents, foods, names of foods, and such you get in the States? Cram all that into something the size of Pennsylvania and that's Britain. Some people live and stay in one village their entire lives. 
* nearly everyone has a passport, while I know people over 30 that have only just got their driving licence.
* what letharus said about talking to people you don't know is totally true - except in university towns, where you can be instant buddies with someone at a pub, then never see them again
* if living in the UK, pretend you're on a cabin cruise, because there are no walk-in closets, no storage areas, nothing of the sort - future British architects could learn a lot from stylish Japanese designers, who have to design small *everything*
* there are many British films you can watch to try to get a sense of Britishness (Trainspotting, This is England, Billy Elliott, The Full Monty, etc.), but the most popular ones seem to expound on the grubby 80's and 90's, and not so much on a bright outlook - watch them, enjoy them, but don't think that's how all of England is - it's similar to all foreigners thinking that 90210 is how every Californian lives, or Sex &amp; the City is how all New Yorkers live. Try The Mighty Boosh, ignore Little Britain, watch The League of Gentlmen, enjoy The IT Crowd...maybe check out Skins if you're under the age of 25 or 30 (the first couple of series are really good), Shameless is really good but set on a council estate (think projects). There's a lot of good TV shows set in the modern day to enjoy and get the feeling of Britishness, I think.

Obviously I'm happy to go along with whatever, but things should definitely only be done with official approval of the club, and the fans of course.

There are a couple of local fans on here right? Perhaps they'd be best to approach the club and supporters associations or whatever to find out what the situation is with their official site and whether or not it's something they want to do.

true,StormingPolaris,null,null,"Claiming foreign ancestry in the United States is a whole different cultural context than doing it elsewhere.  This is largely because immigrant populations, when they emigrated to the United States, tended for a time to live among / work with / support others from the same background.  While true elsewhere, I question whether or not this experience wound up defining cultures the way it has here.  That is to say, it is not so much that immigrants in the US assimilated - they met the culture half way and brought their own foreign cultures with them, in ways which changed US culture as a whole.

My own experience is an example.  My family came here from eastern Europe in the early 20th century, and until a few years ago when it was torn down, they all still went to the Slovak Catholic Church (this is an ordinary Roman Catholic church with Slovak language hymns, and so forth).  

Across the street was an Irish Catholic Church (same thing - Roman Catholic but with Irish songs, traditions, etc.).  In each case, the Church formed a kind of cultural link both to ones past and to immigrant communities who supported each other, loaned money to each other, helped get each other employed, in the early days when they first arrived on US shores.  Then their children grew up in that tradition and so on.  I grew up going to Easter Sunday mass with foreign-language hymns and eastern european culinary traditions, even though I'm pretty much as modern-day American (my parents and grandparents, too) as it is possible to be.

As time went by the ethnic subcultures seeped out and melted into the larger culture.  We celebrate this heritage *in the context* of being Americans.  Being an American, for many people, involves the integration of American principles, ideas, and traditions, with our ethnic heritage.

Nowhere is this more obvious than the way we celebrate St. Patrick's Day, no matter what our background.  This is not a celebration of modern Ireland so much as a celebration of the contributions and influence of Irish immigrants of the past, who contributed dramatically to creating what is modern America (mostly refugees from the potato famine).  Each of these immigrant communities imprinted and changed American culture for everyone.  If you're Catholic in the northeast, no matter what your background, you are more than familiar - even at home - around Italians and Irish food and possibly songs, as a product of this. 

This is, definitionally, what being an American is.  We don't have our own race, nor thousands of years of history (except for native Americans).  While there is immigration everywhere, few countries have been so exclusively defined by immigration as the United States is.  To ignore this or to downplay it would simply be to ignore or marginalize a vital aspect of who we are.

I don't have any affinity for my own ethnicity.  I have been far more influenced by the UK in terms of its cultural exports than by Polish, Slovak, and Russian things (have very little affinity for the food or culture of any of these - don't have anything against them but they don't do it for me).  I grew up eating Italian food and wearing green every St. Patrick's Day.  I am comfortable in ethnically Italian and Irish homes, possibly even more than Polish, Slovak, and Russian ones: it what is familiar.

I like this aspect of being an American.  But it is not the same as ""claiming nationality.""  It is claiming ethnicity, within the context of our own country - ""we're green team and we brought you St. Patrick's day.""  ""We're the white, green, and red team and we brought you pizzerias on every corner!""  It is an understanding of where our ancestral traditions were incorporated into, and wound up defining, the American experience for everyone.  New York City is demonstrative of this with its ethnic festivals, Little Italy, St. Patrick's Day Parade, and so on.  

Our ethnicity is in our cultural DNA.  It always will be, because that is who we are - a country of immigrants, each of which influenced the culture that everyone now shares.",0,1278441282,null,0,true,0,c0tmzx6,t3_cmbe5,t1_c0tmzx6,t1_c0tmlv1,null,1426368928,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I didn't start watching Dr Who regularly until they circled back around on my local PBS to the Fourth doctor.  I started watching around the introduction of Adric, either [Warriors' Gate'(http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Warriors'_Gate) or [The Keeper of Traken](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Keeper_of_Traken).

I watched the rest of the series dutifully every Saturday night for the next few years as PBS finished showing the series.  When I reached [Survival](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Survival) I was again heartbroken that the series was over.  I didn't see the Movie until around 2004.

true,UNITBlackArchive,tardis,,"I've read a few of the new ones, but I have the same issues with the books as I do the comic books (at least the US versions).  

Every writer wants to do an epic Doctor tale that they couldn't do on the show because of budget.  I get that.  In a printed story, you can be as epic as you want to be.   

But usually, it loses that Doctor Who feel BECAUSE it is so epic. It is so over the top that they could never film it, so it never really feels like true Who.  Some are almost R rated too in their darkness, violence, etc. 

Personally, I would like to see more stories from writers who tone it down and make it feel like it could be something filmed. 

There is also the Mary Sue Companion syndrome.   Several books don't have Rose, Martha, Donna, etc.  and make up their own companion.  But in most every case, the new companion is templated from one of the existing companions and has a ridiculous amount of skills and knowledge.    They become SUPER companions, like the writer would almost prefer writing a series of books on their companion than the Doctor. 

So they are an amusing distraction, but I can see why they are generally not considered canon.  

I did like Martha's Story, though.   It told of her year of hell on Earth wandering between the Sound of Drums and Last of the Time Lords.   Still some outrageous stuff and very dark, but one of the better books.

I tried to watch it in high school when a girlfriend of mine was into it.  Saw some Baker.   Some McCoy on PBS, but I could never make heads or tails of it because I kept coming in to parts 4 and 5 of a 12 part story.   I just seemed cheap and jumbled and never really made sense.  I was more into Star Trek: TNG at that time.  That was the new hotness 

So finally, I get to 2005 and Ain't it cool news shows pics of the new show.  Looked really cool.  But it took a good year to get to America on Sci-fi.   I watched it with my wife and it was good.  But we kept missing it and they wouldn't re-run lost episodes, and I gave up. 

Then they ran a marathon one day while I was working from home and saw new stuff I hadn't seen.  I got the DVD sets and LOVED it!!   Been hooked ever since.  It has been my one favorite hobby/show/whatever since.  

Trek died with the new movie.  I am bored to death with Star Wars.  But Who just keeps going..

&gt; The Memo: Well, I'm from the UK and Google tells me that 24USD is 15.8GBP. That's a pretty normal price for a patterned or designed t-shirt over here. I wish people from the US really understood how cheap they get almost everything compared to other countries. :/

&gt; flynnc: Take your righteous anti-American indignation elsewhere. US-made shirts (the material and the screen printing) are as cheap at $6 to $8/each in the US before profit is added by the middleman. That's a white shirt with a one-color printing, and only slightly more for a color shirt. You are woefully unaware of how much profit retailers add to their products.


Gee that was easy. And that's pretty mild by your normal standards.  Take some friendly advice. If you weren't so eager to blow up and start getting abusive you might find your opinions spend more time at the top and less time lingering down below the threshold because people have thought ""Geez, how old is this guy?"" and downvoted you for behaving like that guy everyone hated at school.

true,im_back,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"Actually, when I mentioned to my wife that the BBC Doctor Who movie apparently isn't going to be, I said I thought a 3 doctor story with Tennant, Eccleston and Smith would be cool.

It would never happen, but here's my plot idea:

Rose is tricked by a dalek into being trapped in a timelock filled with daleks and Eccleston is stuck figuring out how to free her (if he frees her, legions of daleks will also be freed). This is the daleks' goal: use the doctor's companion as bait to free more daleks into the universe.

Eccleston uses the psychic paper to write a message to his future self, which is read by both Smith and Tennant.

Smith brings Amy. Tennant is companionless and is at the point after donna's mind is wiped.

Eccleston sees Tennant and factually states, ""you're travelling alone?"" He then sees Smith and Amy and tells them both that they better reveal nothing to him about Rose's future, all he wants is her free now. Smith looks around a notices a growing (and familiar) crack appearing near the timelock.

But the three Doctors in one place causes the reapers from ""Father's Day"" to appear from out of the crack. Smith tells Amy that the Time Lords of old could have prevented their co-mingling to go smoothly (""in fact I've met myself a couple of times in the past""). 

Since Smith is technically the oldest incarnation of the Doctor, it's his job to keep the beasts busy. He spends most of the movie playing hide and seek with the reapers while explaining the situation to Amy. 

Meanwhile, Tennant and Eccleston can see Rose. This causes Tennant's Doctor a lot of emotional pain but he works to free, occassionally slipping lines such as, ""she was fantastic"",  to which Eccleston irritatedly quips ""you're speaking in past tense, but since you're working at this, there must be hope.""

Tennant looks at him and says, ""I hope so. I don't remember this happening from when I was you. And that crack has me worried"".

In the end, the solution is to pull Rose out using the TARDIS to sweep through the timelock, which shatters it and frees the daleks. Since is Rose is in the TARDIS with Eccleston, she's safely swept away from the crack, but the daleks get started to be pulled in, as does Tennant. Eccleston has to materialize the TARDIS around Tennant and pull him to safety. The crack vanishes.

When Rose sees Tennant, she says, ""Hey, haven't I seen you somewhere before? New Years' eve! You're the one who said I have the best year ever! Doctor, what's he doing here? Is he a time traveller like you?""

Eccleston reveals that they are the same. Tennant doesn't remember visiting her (he hasn't yet), but decides that since she didn't recognize him when he regenerated, it must be important she not know. Tennant removes the memory from Rose, and remarks, ""I'm getting good at removing memories from people who travel with me"".

Tennant and Eccleston go their own ways. Tennant's Doctor  watches Rose and Eccleston leave, and is visibly shaken.

The movie ends with Smith and Amy returning to the future, where Amy finally asks, ""Who is she"". And Smith responds, ""The woman I lost, once to another universe and now twice to myself"".",0,1278477709,null,0,false,0,c0tojud,t3_cmp3y,t1_c0tojud,t1_c0tofre,null,1426369669,24,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,24

For the longest time they remained relatively dormant on a oddly peaceful planet.  Then the Daleks found them.  Seeing their potential, they brought them in as weapons in the Time War.  They were no danger to the Daleks since a Dalek never lets a moment of potential evil go unfulfilled. But when feeding upon *potentially* violent races, the Never-were's became fierce monsters, but the Daleks got lucky.  They captured a Time Lord who was a feast of potential evil.  This particular Never-were grew so engorged that it became a being of incomprehensible power, well beyond the control of the Daleks.

I've made experimental forays to The West End Centre in Aldershot, which is very local and very inexpensive. Some of the gigs I've seen have been, um, disappointing, but the interesting Korean percussionists were fabulous, as was Blues Night (I wasn't sure if I was into blues).

There have been many trips to The Anvil in Basingstoke, which is a great venue for classical music, operettas and some ballet. I've also seen Jethro Tull there (turns out I don't like them, but at least I was able to try), as well as Steeleye Span.

Then there have been some trips to Reading, although I've yet to visit The Octagon. Then there's South Hill Park in Bracknell, the Yvonne Arnaud in Guildford and The Princes Hall in Aldershot (although they have rather less stuff of interest). There are ALL kinds of pubs which have live music occasionally, although I've not yet tried that.

The MOST difficult thing to find locally is world cinema, since the Basingstoke cinemas refuse to show even mainstream foreign stuff, which means I have to go to Guildford.

The more I experiment, the more fun I have, with the discovery of The West End Centre last year being the Jewel in the Crown.

And when we had a French penfriend to stay last week, we eschewed London in favour of Portsmouth, and a visit to the historical dockyard, although I suspect a trip to Gunwarf Quays would have been viewed with more favour.

I know there are cheap events in London (went to a great wine tasting evening not long ago near Monument), but the cost of GETTING there is prohibitive- when I took my daughter to see Lady Gaga, we ended up driving, because the cost of driving and parking was way cheaper than taking the train for just the two of us.",0,1278484709,null,0,false,0,c0torut,t3_cmi9m,t1_c0torut,t3_cmi9m,null,1426369772,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

When the time war came along, the time lords realised that they needed an army, so they resurrected some of their great commanders, and freed the CHBK.  
Rassilon mentioned Time Lords being resurrected only to fight and die and be resurrected again. This is the CHBK's doing, he commanded an army consisting of only a handful of time lords, maybe a dozen. As soon as these soldiers died, CHBK sent them back in time to fight alongside themselves, an army of thousands consisting of the same few soldiers, the Meanwhiles.  
Eventually the Daleks fought through the army and confronted him. They gave him a choice; lay down and be defeated, or join them. They recognised his great power and offered him the position of King under the Emperor, offering him legions of Daleks to command.  
The CHBK came to his senses and told them 'no', he stared into the heart of his TARDIS, so ashamed of himself that he erased himself and his army from time, his name was forgotten, but there was still the memory of him.

They also seem to find it hard to build up a sense of place and identity... for example, they'll know their immediate environs and the heart of the city reasonably well, and maybe hold together a small social network (although these seem to very transient), but the city at large remains a mystery and everyone seems to have a rootless quality about them.

How ratings driven does the BBC need to be? They don't have to sell space to advertisers so how much do they need to worry about viewing figures? They're obviously not going to keep making it if nobody is watching but those viewing figures are definitely respectable. It's also one of the few shows they make that rate well in other countries. It even has a following in the US, which UK shows traditionally don't manage. 

Do your figures take into account viewings on iplayer? I think every TV show took a real ratings hit when the World Cup started and lots of people picked up later on. 

Personally I wouldn't mind if they gave Dr Who a few more years and then put it to rest again. The can always pick it up in another 10 years when there's someone ready to keep going again. I'd much rather see it bow out on a triumph than linger around repeating itself and become the butt of lots of jokes again.

EDIT: This is interesting. The ratings you quote are the ""Overnight Ratings"" which don't include HD viewership.

true,abby42,null,null,"The World Cup and excellent weather have conspired to make this series lower rated than it has been, plus the fact that no two episodes aired at the same time for the entire series.

However, the audience share has been good and the appreciation index (AI) has consistently been excellent. People tend to shy away from using AI as an indicator of success because of the idea that when a show starts to lose viewers, the ones that remain are the fans that are predisposed to rate it highly. However, that only really applies in extreme cases: with the advent of SKy+ boxes, the iPlayer, etc., fans are just as likely to watch at their convenience rather than at initial airing as casual viewers. 

Oh, and Doctor Who has gotten more than a million iPlayer views each week, which is pretty astounding. Though I wouldn't say that there's nothing to worry about (better safe than sorry!), the show's doing fine. It ticks a number of boxes for the BBC (family viewing, gets good numbers in a traditionally bad spot, produced outside of London) and it's not in danger of cutbacks or cancellation any time soon.

The moment I heard the original opening theme (I stumbled randomly upon it on YouTube), I fell in love with it, and knew that such a wonderful song must have a wonderful show, and I was right! It was that moment that I decided to start watching DW from the original series, because I didn't want to miss any adventure.

I fully recommend watching the originals too, but I admit that is very hard at times, because of the lack of effects and the acting of those times, but the stories are just as interesting and intriguing, and some of them are simply mind blowing, if you can get past the ancient look of the show.

true,CharlieReynolds,null,null,"Well, I'd say all of them.  But here's what I did for a friend of mine - give you the best and/or most important episodes, in order.  There'll still be a couple that aren't absolutely brilliant, but I'll skip the absolute worst ones.

SERIES 1

* 1x01 - ""Rose"" (not amazing, but certain aspects of the series 5 finale will make more sense, and it's the proper introduction to the Ninth Doctor and Rose)
* 1x02 - ""The End of the World"" (you start to get some good background on the Doctor's past - plot's a little simple, but it's still a good episode)
* 1x03 - ""The Unquiet Dead"" (pretty good episode, introduces the rift in Cardiff, and is a nice introduction to the pseudo-historical episode style)
* 1x06 - ""Dalek"" (perfect introduction to the Daleks, generally great episode; don't worry about the guy who gets into the TARDIS at the end, he's gone by the end of the next episode)
* 1x08 - ""Father's Day"" (Fantastic episode!)
* 1x09 &amp; 1x10 - ""The Empty Child""/""The Doctor Dances"" (Two-parter, best Eccleston episode, introduces Jack aka greatest character ever, written by Steven Moffat, the same guy that wrote ""The Eleventh Hour"")
* 1x12 &amp; 1x13 - ""Bad Wolf""/""The Parting of the Ways"" (Not the greatest, but it's the Ninth Doctor's swan song, with a great ending)

SERIES 2

* SPECIAL - ""The Christmas Invasion"" (Tennant's proper introduction as the Tenth Doctor; I'd recommend watching the Children in Need 7-minute mini-episode thing just before this, it bridges the otherwise-slightly-awkward gap between 1x13 and this)
* 2x01 - ""New Earth"" (I don't care what anyone says, I love this episode)
* 2x02 - ""Tooth and Claw"" (not amazing, but it introduces Torchwood)
* 2x03 - ""School Reunion"" (classic companion returns, pretty good episode)
* 2x04 - ""The Girl in the Fireplace"" (brilliant episode, also written by Steven Moffat)
* 2x05 &amp; 2x06 - ""Rise of the Cybermen""/""The Age of Steel"" (Very important two-parter, introduces the alternate universe and the Cybermen)
* 2x08 &amp; 2x09 - ""The Impossible Planet""/""The Satan Pit"" (Freakin' brilliant two-parter!)
* 2x12 &amp; 2x13 - ""Army of Ghosts""/""Doomsday"" (Rose leaves, one of the better finales)

SERIES 3

* SPECIAL - ""The Runaway Bride"" (not amazing, but it introduces Donna.  Also not the worst episode ever by any means.)
* 3x01 - ""Smith and Jones"" (introduces Martha, the new companion)
* 3x02 - ""The Shakespeare Code"" (I quite like this one, but I know there are those who don't)
* 3x03 - ""Gridlock"" (One of my favorites!)
* 3x06 - ""The Lazarus Experiment"" (I'd tell you to skip this, but there's an aspect of it that is, IMO, very important to the finale)
* 3x08 &amp; 3x09 - ""Human Nature""/""The Family of Blood"" (Another absolutely fantastic two-parter, though I like part 1 much more than part 2)
* 3x10 - ""Blink"" (One of the best single episodes of Doctor Who ever - I've converted several friends on this one episode alone)
* 3x11, 3x12 &amp; 3x13 - ""Utopia""/""The Sound of Drums""/""Last of the Time Lords"" (I love ""Utopia,"" but the other two are more of a mixed bag.  It's pretty much required viewing, though.  And my favorite character returns for these 3 episodes!)

SERIES 4

* SPECIAL - ""Voyage of the Damned"" (If you really want to finish the sort-of-cliffhanger ending of 3x13, you can watch this, but I wasn't a big fan, and it's not terribly important.  I would recommend the Steven Moffat-penned Children in Need special that takes place before this episode, ""Time Crash."")
* 4x01 - ""Partners in Crime"" (Return of Donna; decent episode)
* 4x03 - ""Planet of the Ood"" (Another of my personal favorites)
* 4x04 &amp; 4x05 - ""The Sontaran Stratagem""/""The Poison Sky"" (One of my favorite ""Return of the Classic Villain"" episodes)
* 4x08 &amp; 4x09 - ""Silence in the Library""/""Forest of the Dead"" (Another Steven Moffat two-parter, this is another of my favorites and is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL VIEWING BEFORE SERIES 5)
* 4x10 - ""Midnight"" (The best Doctor Who story that Russel T Davies ever wrote.  Another personal favorite.)
* 4x11, 4x12 &amp; 4x13 - ""Turn Left""/""The Stolen Earth""/""Journey's End"" (""Turn Left"" is required viewing, a fantastic episode; the other two are kind of a muddled mess, but they're very important episodes)

2008-2010 SPECIALS

* ""The Next Doctor"" (Fuck the haters, I loved this one!)
* ""The Waters of Mars"" (Kinda cheesy, but the Doctor's character arc is brilliant)
* ""The End of Time, Parts 1 &amp; 2"" (Another bit of a muddled mess, but it's David Tennant's last episode, and his character arc is brilliant once again; it also leads directly into ""The Eleventh Hour"")

Pretty much every episode of Series 5 is important, with the possible exception of ""The Lodger"" (though I quite enjoyed that episode, and it may become important in series 6).  I'd watch all 13 of those.

So yeah, there you have it.  Actually this might be even more helpful:

EPISODES TO AVOID:

* ""Aliens of London""/""World War Three"" (UTTER GARBAGE)
* ""Boom Town"" (Slightly better, but too closely related to ""AoL""/""WWIII"" to be watchable)
* ""Love &amp; Monsters"" (Worst DW episode ever)

true,buildmonkey,eu,Fake Yorkshireman,"Ain't just in London that they are getting twitchy about cameras. My story is not as ridiculous or extreme but it feels odd that it happened just before reading this. 

I was at a small local train station last night. A couple of plods were hanging around waiting for the train, I assumed that they were going to collect a fare-dodger or something. But when the train arrived they started running up and down the platform trying to cover all the train doors between the two of them. Amused I started to trying to film it on my phone but I only got about 3-4 seconds before it was my turn to board, and frankly I was more interested in just getting on and going home. However they held the train, kept all the doors open and fetched the driver out of his cab. Next thing I heard was one of the plod loudly and deliberately giving my description into his walkie-talkie, ending with 'and is taking too much interest in us.' He was looking right at me forcefully as he said it, and was clearly intending to intimidate me for having dared to film them. A good citizen would have shut up and sat down but the only possible answer to a cop doing that is to get all middle-class at them so I went straight to the door and politely but just as forcefully asked him what I could do to help, which seemed to surprise and annoy him and he refused to answer me.

They held the train for a few more minutes, during which time various passengers seemed to think it was because of me (which I sincerely doubt, I was just a petty annoyance, and they were actually looking for a real suspect). One of the passengers wanted to see my bag because the plod had described it as having 'strange writing' on it. It was a sad disappointment to them because the Aeroflot logo is in cyrillic not arabic so I can't have been a terrorist, even if I do have a beard.

Other episodes come to mind with incredible plots and writing - The War Games, The Edge of Destruction, Keeper of Traken, Enlightenment, The Deadly Assassin, Greatest Show in the Galaxy (you can bash me for that one), Even though its not great, even Mark of the Rani is a good historical piece because it didn't center around any one historical figure so completely that you needed that person to be completely believable to enjoy the episode. 

It's more of survival horror than science fiction/fantasy sometimes. When was the last time we had an episode like ""the face of evil?"" While the acting and sets and effects were poor, there was an incredibly interesting plot line about a crashed ship, where two tribes emerge as a eugenics experiment? 

Or how about an episode like ""Inferno?"" We have seen parallel universes, but to watch the same events unfold in two scenarios was stellar. 

It's hard for me to really describe how the episodes of the classic series resonated with me, while the reboot just seems like a completely different show save for the TARDIS and some recurring villains, villains at that which have lost their teeth.

a) Paradoxes.

b) *If and only if* the future from which the cause comes is guaranteed to will-have happened.

It doesn't matter whether you have a time machine or not (and how do you create a causal paradox in time without a time machine anyway?).

Meaning you've falsified both of the New Series's new bases:

1) No more parallel universes; everything has to happen *within the Doctor's single universe* (otherwise you stop caring about what happens to the characters because ""oh, that didn't happen to **our** Amy / Rory / Rose / Mickey / Donna"").

2) Time *can* be written; which means the future doesn't necessarily exist as predicted / observed-previously. Like either a light in the refrigerator or Schrödinger's Cat. Or like universes-fanning-out, except we've excluded parallel universes.

Hence, paradox. Effect without cause. Impossible and therefore *badly written*. Not at all what I expected from Mr Moffat.

&gt; As for the Daleks: they don't know what happens if the vaporize the Doctor.

Nonsense. a) They've fought him for centuries. b) They fought **all** the Time Lords for centuries. c) It wasn't just the Daleks, it was Slitheen with finances and equipment, Cybermen who've gained their own space-and-time technology, Sontaran genetic technology, Silurian millenia-advanced technology.

And besides: you're arguing that ""leaving him alive and trapped even though he escapes from traps all the time"" is a more certain proposition than ""vapourising him and he ***might*** somehow come back to life from that"".

&gt; what is at the heart of my comparison, Moffat ended the series with well-established characters that we would get to continue on with for a bit.

... *well put*. Your point is acknowledged.

&gt; so the Doctor and every one around him was constantly touting his great-ness.

Picked up an old copy of the Magazine yesterday and flipped through it. Even the show reviewers managed to get printed the opinion that Davies was just way too ""in love with the Doctor"".

(Trying and failing to resist an ""and look how he f\*\*\*\*\* it"" comment here.)

&gt; I mean, we didn't really have ONE example of a ""I'm the Doctor and this is why I'm gonna save the day"" speech. We had the two threatening speeches to alien races

... can't remember two, unless you mean the one where he scares the Prisoner Zero guard away. Which to be honest, sounds more like a ""look how big and scary and wonderful I am"" speech anyway.

&gt; What about the classic series did you find to be amazingly consistent? The look? The writing? I'd agree on the look, but certainly not the writing or continuity.

Well, the *continuity* in as much as events from a previous Doctor seemed to carry over to later Doctors better. Fewer paradoxes (especially, fewer just for the sake of a cutesy joke). The universe not getting destroyed ***and undone*** all the time (in fact, an established reason for not going back and changing your own history, in a *time travel* show).

Not to mention the other slack-poor inconsistencies with the Doctor sticking his hand into the crack; or River and her diary in a universe where no Doctor is supposed to exist. I'd **come** to expect that kind of crap from RTD. It was *heartbreaking* to see that come from Moffat.

Not to mention the massive disconnect from the previous (post-movie) series to the new series; just RTD's ""lets ignore the books and age-continuity and almost entirely reboot everything"".

I mean, really... it's almost getting to the stage where you can argue that the new ""Star Trek"" is as much like the old ""Star Trek"" as the old and new ""Doctor Who"" is: ""we carried over what we wanted and ignored the rest"".

(And for the record? The only money I've spent on the new ""Star Trek"" was the electricity burned on watching the pirate copy I was shown. No more ""Star Trek"" for me, I fear.)

If Moffat hadn't cutesied-and-wrecked-up the final episode, I would've lashed out the $140 on the River screwdriver that never came to my country's shops. Instead, I'm trying to work out if it's worth getting the new green screwdriver for $40.

Moffat, heartbreakingly, is allowing ""Doctor Who"" to remain descended into a kid's Fantasy show (especially when we already have SJA and the new damn K-9). Seems ""Doctor Who"" can't be adult unless it's about Jack and Tosh bumping uglies with aliens.

And if this keeps up, instead of ""Doctor Who"" regaining rights to being the world's longest running Science-Fiction show, the happier my bank balance is going to be, I'm afraid.

Hah.

Point acknowledged that the speech to the Prisoner Zero guard was basically a ""I'm the Doctor and here's why I""m awesome""...there is, in the new series, much less idolizing of The Doctor by those surrounding him.  The most nauseating example of this was in PLANET OF THE DEAD, when the UNIT doctor is awe struck at the mention of the name ""The Doctor.""  With RTD, it wasn't only that the Doctor's head was up his ass, so was everyone who'd ever heard of him.  Or the Jackson Lake speech at the end of NEXT DOCTOR....Uhg. 

Interesting point on the continuity.  I'm not a reader of the books and never considered them Who canon, but I really don't see why they screw up his age so much?  Even my wife, who's not a huge fan, pointed that out.  She said the other say when Tenant says ""I'm 903 years old.""  she immediately spoke ""How does he keep getting younger?""

It's strange, but since the premiere of Series 5 I've been going back and watching a lot more Classic.  It's because Series 5 reminded me of the Doctor Who of old, whereas Series 1 thru 4 felt to me like an entirely different animal.  Other than (pretty much) completely dropping the ball on the return of The Silurians, the 5th Series (and Matt Smith in particular) just took me back.

I've had the last week off and I've watched The Talons of Weng Cheng, Terminus, Kings Daemons (fucking great!), Evil of the Daleks, and most of Trial of a Time Lord (I'm a self hater I guess).  While at the same time inter-weaving episodes of the new series.  It just all feels like Doctor Who to me.

Rather than paying our tax money to an American company we could save so much money.

Even a paid for distro (like Redhat EL or Novell) would be better as these companies publish their changes for the benefit of the world.

Also seeing as XP is not going to be sold soon many organisations would have to pay to upgrade their machines.

Not to mention security.....

At my work (web industry) we are allowed to choose - it is always the Windows users that have days of downtimes due to random Windows errors - NEVER linux (it is 10000% easier to fix a Linux issue always...)

I run Ubuntu on a 800Mhz CPU and 256MB ram and it is ok - would a machine like that run Vista or Win7 well.....

I NEVER liked windows, coming from an Amiga background (I had the 500 + 1200).

When My Amiga died in 1996 I got a Windows PC that cost 4 times the amount had 16 times the RAM and was about 50 times time faster in CPU speed (in Mhz) but was about 1000 X slower in doing anything, it was so unstable, everything cost lots more but did not have the capabilities of software on the Amiga (untill about 1/2 decade later) and our entire OS actually crashed (all the time) - with the Amiga crashes (guru mediations) nearly always occurred only ever in games.

So for me I view Microsoft as a company that make computing progress go backwards.

As well as being technical inept MS use their monopoly to prevent progress and innovation.

Microsoft use FUD and threats about made up patents relating to Linux and open-source software to use a Mafia style technique of bullying money out of companies - with 'patent deals' - Tomtom and Amazon are recent victims.

All the details are off record (if the details were ever publicised Microsoft could no longer use FUD as a weapon...) (I prey someone leaks the info to wikileaks)

The result of Microsoft tactics have both helped to prevent innovation in the industry (Apple are being just as bad recently) and end up costing governments around the world huge bills with windows licenses that could be avoided and spent to improve society - alternatives exist but MS have always done their most to ensure that competition cannot exist

For anyone who is slightly interested in the detail here is a very good link

(Doesn't have much info on the last 1/2 decade - they haven't changed - in some way got far worse

Anyone who knows about the company SCO see

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO-Linux_controversies#Microsoft_funding_of_SCO_controversy

They are a hideous company who will use any immoral means to bugger their competitors - Microsoft customers are like people locked in the Matrix, they just need to wake up.

The money Gates has given back (via the gates foundation) probably doesn't equal the money he has skanked from various governments in the 1st place.

Maybe he's giving the wealth back due to guilt ?

I think the reason why they get away with charging above the average is a combination of things. 1) They don't give a crap about offering a broadband service, 2) Brand, lots of customers have been with them from back when BT was the only option 3) Fear of changing provider, it's very confusing, especially for the older generation 4) BT marketing and customer service propaganda.

What do you mean? I assume to have no practical knowledge of companies, by the way, so any knowledge you have in that area is superior to mine.

The difference being, like it or not, the majority of people coming to a workplace will have knowledge of Windows. Therefore, as you say, there needs to be training for one particular programme, it would be likely to take less time because the user may already be acquainted with the system.

However, installing linux, whichever desktop they use, it will still require almost back-to-basic training. Far more indepth training. They have to understand the system behind it before you can start training for things like OpenOffice.

I doubt it would be an issue for younger civil servants, but older ones? Those who aren't tech savvy, or even embracing of technology?

true,essjay2009,cnty-wales,Bristol,"I've spent the last six years working for various government suppliers so I can throw in some detail on this. 

I'd be very surprised if this happens. The biggest hurdle to getting non MS kit into the govt is support costs. Supporting windows and office is cheap, supporting *nix is expensive. And while it may not need as much effort, govt organisations that require uptime will have to post a full time engineer to support. That's expensive. Typically, it also means hiring someone new, as all the internal support staff are MS trained and accredited. So basically, if you're selling a system in to a govt organisation they already have on site support staff to deal with it. 

Another major issue is user familiarity and training. When your recruiting admin staff and other non-skilled workers it's easy to request that they have windows and office experience. If you ask for OOo and *nix experience you wouldn't get anyone in those jobs. And even if you take the hit and train people up, there are far fewer *nix trainers out there than windows trainers, again pushing the price up. Like support, it's a supply and demand issue. 

I've seen govt customers turn down the best system in a competitive tender purely because it was *nix based. I've also seen them mandate in the requirements that the solution run on their existing infrastructure I.e.windows. 

I don't like it any more than you, but it's the case. And while we think it would be cheaper because of the save on licensing, it would be pretty trivisl for a government department to demonstrate that the TCO is far cheaper than an OO alternative. I've seen it happen.

I'm not saying we have to swan around wearing top hats and typing ""charmed, toodle pip"" to each other, but the middle ground is much more relaxing.

&gt; She said the other say when Tenant says ""I'm 903 years old."" she immediately spoke ""How does he keep getting younger?""

***THANK YOU***. And to your wife as well. First episode of the Seventh Doctor, he points out that he's **953**. Sheesh.

The between-novels definitely **aren't** canon now; especially as the new series has either contradicted or flatly taken their plots (see: ""Human Nature"", originally a 7th Doctor story).

As has been mentioned elsewhere here - quite right, the need for the Epic Big writing now necessitates nothing less than Daleks and the Destruction of the Universe in a final episode. Damnit. Ridiculous.

In the Old Days, we could focus on the tragedy of the area around Logopolis being destroyed by being shown that Nyssa's home planet (one already visited and saved) had been lost.

And the one thing that surprises me most and makes me think it's not worth hanging around here - the ""detractors"" who claim you're downvoted because you're not part of Team Davies or Team Moffat (and I choose those terms both deliberately and derisively; your point about RTD is well-taken)... well, I've seen more evidence it **is** that way than otherwise. Maybe we **should** all adopt cravats and top hats.

I love me my Who. As long as you include the novels, even the Eighth Doctor is quite acceptable. It's all great. I guess my concern is the drop in writing quality.

And particularly in the case of River and the Doctor, his first meeting with her was her last meeting with him, and possibly vice versa, what if he himself at a future point for him tells a past point for River knowing she will need his trust and thus naming himself? 

They seem to be laying it on pretty thick regarding marriage and or assasin. It swings wildly back and forth between, ""my love"" and ""don't trust her"" and it seems to me the implication is that while there is a possibility she is his wife their is equal evidence to suggest she is responsible for his death,probably both, (which means it is bound to be neither) so maybe its a deathbed thing?

If you believe the non-canonical stories, though, they seem to also be involved in judging The Doctor's time meddling.  They also did not seem to exist until after the Great Time War.  Prior to that, the Time Lords pretty much were the judges of such things, when they deigned to interfere.  So before the war, you had the Time Lords outside of time, managing the history of the universe. But after they were going to be time-locked, at some point they had to come up with some history of the universe that was going to be ""official"", even with all the time-travel going on inside it.  This may be the origin of the Doctor's current claim that there are ""fixed points"" in time which he should not change, and the existance of The Shadow Proclamation to ensure those fixed points aren't.
