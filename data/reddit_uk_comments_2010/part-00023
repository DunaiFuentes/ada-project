* The organisation has been completely infiltrated by organised (and disorganised) crime

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"It's a pretty bad situation with regards to finding jobs just after education, and one that the Government has ignored for a good long while - the recession has just made it a lot worse as businesses are scaling back as much as possible to try avoid any potential financial risks.

I would suspect the coming months will make it even worse with the cuts to public sector workers causing the problem to get even worse.

I think what they should consider doing is reforming welfare for the unemployed to offer one of two choices - 

You get a standard low-rate jobseekers on the same terms as are offered now, to find a job for yourself.

OR

You take a work placement on a rolling monthly contract, earning more than you would on jobseekers but gaining working experience too.

This would address the significant problem of 'lack of experience' for those just leaving education. Agencies are avoiding signing inexperienced people on because they are potential financial risks for the company if they leave a bad impression, whilst employers aren't willing to hire someone who doesn't have existing skills that could be put to use.

The education system does not do enough to promote suitable skills for the workplace whilst balanced against a good standard of education. I think a lot more could be done to help those just out of education too who don't pursue higher education.

* The BBC do not want ""The Stig"" to be known, they fired the last one for revealing himself in a book (to top up his wages).
* He wanted more money than he was getting.
* He saw a magazine article which contained a picture of him, he does not clarify if this directly labelled him as Stig or if it was a list of potential Stigs and he just happened to be on it.
* He thinks writing an autobiography that details his time on the show as The Stig is less damaging to his secret identity than a magazine that has his picture (potentially not even directly labelling him).
* He wanted the BBC to fund his Le man 24 hour dream, they wanted him to get independent sponsorship.
* He claims to have had to pay his own insurance while working as The Stig.

I can see why he was fired to be honest, he wanted more money on account of supposedly being a major part of Top Gear, unfortunately for him HE is not. The Stig is a completely replaceable part of Top Gear.

Its like James Bond, Doctor Who or indeed the Doctors Assistant... the lead actor/actress playing those roles knows what they are getting into when they take the part, at some point down the line should they demand more money because they think they are invaluable to their film/show then they know they will get replaced.

Its not the actor/driver that draws the crowd unlike shows that rely on a constant irreplaceable cast like House, 30 Rock, The Simpsons, True Blood, Stargate etc... but the fictional character.


Lastly i have to say as a British tax payer who forks out about £130 a year on the TV license i am quite glad that the BBC is not throwing money at people who spit the dummy out of the pram like this. Now if only they can stop giving flavour of the month celebrities millions of pounds a year contracts and start funnelling that cash into more shows ill be a happy chappy.

&gt;Lady Justice Brenda Hale DBE said in December 2005:
It is now well recognised that a misplaced conception of equality has resulted in
some very unequal treatment for the women and girls who appear before the
criminal justice system. Simply put, a male-ordered world has applied to them its
perceptions of the appropriate treatment for male offenders…. The criminal justice
system could … ask itself whether it is indeed unjust to women.


{page 12}

&gt;These differences highlight the importance of the need for sentencers to bear these
matters in mind when sentencing. However, this is not to say that men with sole care of
children should be treated differently from women with sole care of children, nor that a
man with a mental health illness should be treated less favourably than a woman with
the same mental health illness. 

{page 13}


&gt;Sentencers must be made aware of the differential impact sentencing decisions have on
women and men including caring responsibilities for children or elders; the impact of
imprisonment on mental and emotional well-being; and the disproportionate impact that
incarceration has on offenders who have caring responsibilities if they are imprisoned a
long distance from home.

In the same document they both explain that you shouldn't make assumptions about women (or men) such as whether or not they are a provider or carer, that women are weaker than men, etc. That these assumptions and stereotypes are damaging. 

Then, further down in the document, they say: 

""Women offenders experience high rates of mental health disorders, victimisation, abuse and substance misuse, and have low skills and rates of employment. Their specific needs are distinct from those of male offenders.""

Seriously? So don't apply sweeping generalizations about groups of people unless you need to apply sweeping generalizations about groups of people. Makes sense to me.


But then they say this:

""Sentencers must be made aware of the differential impact sentencing decisions have on women and men including caring responsibilities for children or elders; the impact of imprisonment on mental and emotional well-being; and the disproportionate impact that incarceration has on offenders who have caring responsibilities if they are imprisoned a long distance from home.""

Which actually **IS** something that is worth discussing and analyzing.

But the text before it is completely discriminatory. They are essentially calling out why you should probably give less time to female criminals than male criminals. So it's not just ""reminding judges to take into account their circumstances and mental health"" because if it was, there would be no need to call the whole group out based on their sex.

#2 had #1's grumpiness at times, and an impatience for people not recognizing his brilliance. He had differences, but at times seemed to have flashes of what Hartnell's doctor might have been in a younger body.

I also felt that #1 and #7 were easy to reconcile together. They both had that profesorly vibe and they both had a scheming side. Plus, in Remembrance and perhaps other stories, they actually indicated that the first doctor had hidden things away  that the seventh doctor employed to his advantage. Seven showed up and it was a bit like just picking up his old things. I think it's one of the things I liked about his Doctor. It was the same scheming Doctor who emptied the mercury from the Tardis so he could go exploring among other things, just in a different outer shell, and you felt that he had a long history behind him. 

10 is my favorite, but he was very unique. I kind of imagined that the Doctor had finally found a young body that he enjoyed being and was able to act like a kid again and enjoy himself, sort of how an old man would react if he was suddenly given back his youth and energy.  When his dark side came through though, I think you could really see flashes of 7 (Human Nature/Family of Blood were original from a 7th doctor novel anyway).  

Although I wish 10 had gone one season with Moffat at the helm, Matt Smith has done something really great with the role. I see touches of Pertwee, Troughton and Hartnell in his portrayal. It really feels like he is the old man in a young man's body.  I remember that when they cast a doctor that young, I was worried, but was hoping we would sort of get a William Hartnell old man in a Young Man's body. I think he really feels like he could have been the previous doctors with a new face.

It easy to interpret this at least two ways. The headline says one thing but the article is not so clear.

It implied that judges are not taking mitigating factors in to consideration. It does not state in the article that women should be treated more leniently than men, everything else being equal. 

Any man who has a spouse or girlfriend (or mother or sister) would know that women and men act and think differently.

If you wanted you could construct an entire lifetime of changing philosophies and new perspectives around the new regenerations of the Doctor. Perhaps in a life time that lasts ages and defies linear time flow a person can come to embody a variety of personas, each influenced by the lessons of the last, their temptations and their heartbreaks. To consider that the path has not been of a single linear mode of character development is to assume that life is a bildungsroman with only one major theme or character flaw. His life revolves around a nexus of past experience and unearthly progressions, who are we to judge the vagaries of the evolution of his personality, especially when so many aspects of his personality are constant, if hidden in the background of all the different faces we see. The TARDIS as policebox, the sonic, the companions, these things reflect a subset of personality vectors fixed in the changing schema of The Doctor's mind. To know the Doctor is not to fix on his superficial personality at any point in time, but to understand his mission, the stability that fuels the hurricane of devastation that Daleks and Cybermen fear.

Even Tom Baker's birth in 'Robot' caused this feeling. It really surprised me and made me wonder at the power of it. I always found the writing pulls you back into the character as it progresses, but initially, the good writers exploit your apprehension and discomfort just enough, while drip-feeding consistency back into the character.

I love this system, I feel like the process is representative of real-life and is quite meta (due, of course, to the reasons for it's original adoption).  It is a massive source of inspiration for both actor and writer. It's like the writers are actually ""The Doctor"", his knowledge, all his memories, motivations, responsibilities and actions, but the actor is the personality, the face, the emotion, and the conduit of all that knowledge.

&gt;'Whether it can be altered or not, whether it's right or wrong, landlordism is one of the causes of poverty,' Owen repeated. 'Poverty is not caused by men and women getting married; it's not caused by machinery; it's not caused by ""over-production""; it's not caused by drink or laziness; and it's not caused by ""over-population"". It's caused by Private Monopoly. That is the present system. They have monopolized everything that it is possible to monopolize; they have got the whole earth, the minerals in the earth and the streams that water the earth. The only reason they have not monopolized the daylight and the air is that it is not possible to do it. If it were possible to construct huge gasometers and to draw together and compress within them the whole of the atmosphere, it would have been done long ago, and we should have been compelled to work for them in order to get money to buy air to breathe. And if that seemingly impossible thing were accomplished tomorrow, you would see thousands of people dying for want of air--or of the money to buy it--even as now thousands are dying for want of the other necessities of life. You would see people going about gasping for breath, and telling each other that the likes of them could not expect to have air to breathe unless they had the money to pay for it. Most of you here, for instance, would think and say so. Even as you think at present that it's right for so few people to own the Earth, the Minerals and the Water, which are all just as necessary as is the air. In exactly the same spirit as you now say: ""It's Their Land,"" ""It's Their Water,"" ""It's Their Coal,"" ""It's Their Iron,"" so you would say ""It's Their Air,"" ""These are their gasometers, and what right have the likes of us to expect them to allow us to breathe for nothing?"" And even while he is doing this the air monopolist will be preaching sermons on the Brotherhood of Man; he will be dispensing advice on ""Christian Duty"" in the Sunday magazines; he will give utterance to numerous more or less moral maxims for the guidance of the young. And meantime, all around, people will be dying for want of some of the air that he will have bottled up in his gasometers. And when you are all dragging out a miserable existence, gasping for breath or dying for want of air, if one of your number suggests smashing a hole in the side of one of the gasometers, you will all fall upon him in the name of law and order, and after doing your best to tear him limb from limb, you'll drag him, covered with blood, in triumph to the nearest Police Station and deliver him up to ""justice"" in the hope of being given a few half-pounds of air for your trouble.'

true,buildmonkey,eu,Fake Yorkshireman,"The move to get everybody on Incapacity Benefit onto ESA is being done in the knowledge that the ESA assessment process is broken and that it is currently throwing a large number of genuinely significantly disabled people off benefit. They are intentionally ignoring this and are intentionally planning on harming a lot of people.

They know this because the doctor involved in designing the new medical test has come out to say that that it is not working as intended and that people who should be staying on ESA to get support to become employable are being incorrectly assessed, thrown off and as a result are getting no support to get back into work.

They know this because Danny Alexander, [Secretary to the Treasury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Alexander), prior to his current adoption of ConDem values, was a campaigner against the way ESA was assessed and even contributed to a TV documentary about how it is getting things wrong.

They know this because the DWPs own figures show that far more people are being thrown off ESA than was predicted, in particular far fewer people are getting Support Component than was intended.

They know this because appeals to The Tribunals Service have doubled in the last year to the point where it is close to collapse and we are winning most of those appeals because of the poor quality of assessment and decision making.

I just had to do an appeal for a young man with part of his bowel removed who shits into a bag through the side of his stomach. He has to change the bag regularly and shit slops out when he does so. His doctors have told him that he cannot work yet because it could compromise the operation to reconnect his anus so that he can eventually have a long and productive working life. He scored zero points in the new test (edit: and was told that he would have to claim JSA instead). At the tribunal they did not even call him into the hearing room before awarding him the exemption from the work capability assessment that the DWP should have given him several months previously.

And guess what. I had the chance to argue for more money for him at the tribunal by getting him Support Component (edit: and the tribunal would probably have awarded it) but he declined because he wanted the assistance back into employment that he optimistically believed that he would get on Work Related Activities Component. 

So forgive me if I feel that your comment came across as both ignorant and self-satisfied.

true,sirbruce,null,null,"&gt; We are arguing semantics I think, but I think the important part is that extra lives are gained by physical processes. There is a physical cap on the number of times a time lord can regenerate.

No one is disputing that?

&gt; To say that since the time lords are now gone the limit is lifted is silly.

I agree... that's why I'm not one of the people saying that.

&gt; The doctor could indeed go into the time lock, go to gallifrey, and get a new set of regenerations through whatever process is available.

Getting through the time lock seems quite difficult but I'm sure he could do it.  My point was that The Doctor could do something far more easier, like access the power of The Eye of Harmony (if it's still a part of the TARDIS, or however that one connects to the one on Gallifrey), or The Source, and so on.  Heck, if The Heart of the TARDIS can make Captain Jack immortal it should be able to grant a Time Lord more regenerations.

My entire point, which you seemed to disagree with, is that there are numerous ways to get extra regenerations without involved the Time Lords, who may be currently Out of Bounds.

If we are to move workers from the public to private sector and still accomplish the same tasks, we can't really expect a saving; a knowledge transfer takes time and increases risks, and private money goes to private profits. Conversely, there's a theoretical economy of scale with state managed projects.

One thing that we must not do is ship tasks out from the public sector to the lowest bidder. There are criteria other than cost which are all too often ignored. Hospital cleaning was moved out in this manner some years ago, shortly before the outbreak of MRSA.

It is important to note that; Alistair Darling admitted that he would have raised VAT, Tony Blair approves of the economic policies of the coalition and a number of the reforms they are undertaking and Labour were going to make cuts but at a marginally slower pace (but still significant cuts nevertheless).

These cuts were going to come at some point. I would rather be in a position where the government could inject cash into the economy during difficult economic times, however the extent of the deficit, the size of the state and the sceptical market mean that their are very avenues that the government can take.

Anyway, we were running at least 20-30min late, and just as we pass Bridgend, the driver takes the exit (interrogation look in my face), parks next to this small gas station that also has warm snacks.  He opens the door, mumbles something nobody quite understands (and I was sitting in the front), and just takes off with his lunch box.  We see him just walk away through a wooded patch and then to an unmarked building. Someone says he thinks the driver said he'd be back in an hour.

Everyone is basically wondering what is going on, some people call their friends/family to pick them up since we were SO close to Cardiff already.  I had to call my friend, tell her I'd be late, I go get something to eat since it was 6pm or so.  So the bus slowly empties, with the people staying wondering what the hell is happening.  Then about an hour later the driver finally reappears, gets in like everything is normal, and finally drives us to Cardiff central.

Turns out he had gone over his hours without rest (which is fair enough), but somehow hadn't bothered to call the company so they would get someone over to drive us to Cardiff during his break.

Something about the atmosphere seemed to change as well, and the staff seemed to be generally fucked off with life. Maybe I went on a bad couple of nights?

Clowns comes a close second to Indigo for me. A proper Italian family owned place.

The Flying Pig my favourite pub in town. Great atmosphere, good music, cute landlady, laid back clientelle. It's just a pity that it's not too well located.

I've never been to Clare Cellars. I'm not a student, so I guess I'll need my own NUS/CU card?

Too right about Jaffa Net looking sketchy. That's why I never went in there, but was confused about the number of people I would see going in and out. I'll check that out too.

My favourite place to sit is on top of Castle Mound/Cambridge Castle (after grabbing a few cold beers from Cambridge Wine Merchants), and of course, it's a great spot for a bit of suitoring.

Exactly; the government failed to ensure that privatisation led to competition in the privatisation of royal mail, and therefore I have no faith that the same won't happen again in the privitisation of royal mail.

If I want to go from Oxenholme to Warrington I have no choice but to get on a Virgin train, even though I would never do so if there was a viable alternative, since their trains are consistently late, overcrowded and tugging empty first class carriages while I don't even have room to sit on my bag. However, I encourage their behaviour by paying my fare because I have no alternative. No competition. In the same day I had to get a First train across the lake district and an Arriva train out of warrington. Both were on time, had plenty of luggage space and had one or no first class carriages.

Match ratings

* Cudicini 7 could have done more to stop the first, maybe. Otherwise fairly solid
* Ćorluka 5 was p.bad tbh. Maybe not helped by Lennon having a bad day infront of him.
* King 7 could have stopped either goal but that is asking a lot. Otherwise anonymous (a good thing for a CB)
* Kaboul 8 really impressed me actually. Still don't think he'd work with Dawesome or Bassong yet but showing a lot of potential.
* BAE 6 when he's good he's great, when he's not he gives away goals, at fault (x2) for the first goal
* Lennon 4 maybe needs to come off the bench for a game or two, looks really out of it. Having fresh legs against tiring teams might get him his confidence back.
* Huddlestone 7 looked a bit cumbersome have to defend against Marin (but who wouldn't) good link up play though. He really is one of our main players atm.
* Jenas 8 I thought this was a good performance from him. Did a lot of leg work, got stuck in a bit and made few mistakes. Being given the 'defensive shield' role works really well for him actually, he can play the simple ball and isn't being relied on to do too much. Great ball (I think it was him) to VdV for the 2nd.
* Bale 9 another classy performance. Although I do get a feeling he's making himself a bit too well known. If only other teams weren't allowed to watch him.
* VdV 9 Took a bit to get into the game but his touch and class was head and shoulders above anyone else on the park. Lovely ball to set up Crouchy. Pity he had to come off, hopefully he's alright.
* Crouch 8 I hope he is having his nachos tonight. Good movement, good goal, got involved. Pity he just couldn't finish it off at the death. I think a lot of the 'Crouch can't play up front on his own' talk should quieten down after this.
* Keane 6 not VdV but put himself about, a couple of times he nearly pulled something off like the old Robbie would've.
* Palacios 6 out of position but didn't disgrace himself.


Overall: We seemed to come out full force, maybe due to excitement, and it worked until we began to tire.

But if they just go around blowing up cashiers or even City bankers they probably won't have much support at all. (in fact if they hit any cashiers I suspect they will become immensely unpopular). They have to be extremely careful about targets - and bombs don't tend to be terribly discriminating.

true,barksmith,null,null,"Hi there! I don't go to Brighton Uni but I do live and work in Brighton, I also have plenty of friends who have studied there. 

Rent - It depends what you want, Brighton is a very expensive place to live (London prices expensive!) but you could find a reasonably priced place if you have a good look around [Brighton Gumtree](""http://brighton.gumtree.com/brighton/5025_1.html"") is a good place to start. By reasonable, I mean a decent house share in Brighton town of around £300/month. The areas that would be good for the Uni are areas like Kemp Town, Lewes Road, The Level, London Road, Hanover. Avoid Hove, it’s expensive and out of the way for Brighton Uni. If you wanted to live on your own you’ll be looking at anything from £600 upwards really. The Uni does have some Halls of Residence too, which are cheaper but are further out of town so it all depends on what you want. Brighton has literally hundreds of things going on every night so I’d advise you live as close to the centre as your budget will allow. Bills would be about another £60-£80/month, depending on the size of the house, if you have internet etc – if you live in a student share, there is no council tax to pay either which saves the household about £180/month

Bus Tickets – Student prices are £100/3 months or £300/year. If you live near town though you’d hardly use it, but that's pretty cheap and probably worth the inital outlay anyway - as the buses are £1.80 standard fair.

Mobile – I’m guessing you’d be calling America? Your best bet would be a contract with unlimited minutes for around £20/month. Or there are plenty of shops around that sell phone cards you could use quite cheaply and then get a pay as you go mobile (which would be up to you how much you spend). Or of course…use Skype to call America, it’s free.

Food – Sooo many food shops/restaurants/supermarkets around. Co-op is good for convenience but it’s far from the cheapest. You could live on £20/week shopping at the likes of LIDL or ALDI. You could cook or shop or eat a different style of food every night. I’d say £30/week would see you eating pretty well for a student.

Basically, I’d say if you put aside £400/month for bills and rent, you could more than easily eat, go out for a few drinks, buy supplies for Uni, wash etc etc for £100/week. In fact, you’ll be one of the better off students around!

Hope that helps, I went on a bit but there you go. Let me know if you have any else you want to know. Also…if you do come over, give me a shout and I might be able to hook you up with a student friendly job. Plus of course, always up for a beer with a fellow redditor!

Good Luck!

During a meeting at Scotland Yard, some of the pope's most bitter opponents were advised not to overdo it when exercising their democratic freedom to demonstrate.

I think our reception to the Pope is doing wonders for our reputation as a nation. Even if it did not, who cares. Britain is secular and doesn't like being forced to pay for rich religious leaders to visit our country. I'm not ashamed of this, I'm proud that British people avoid being apathetic about what is a waste of their money so that almost every major achievement we have made in the past 50 years can be insulted.

Still, I thought I'd give them a chance, and yeah, when the older Daleks volunteered themselves for extermination, I was suitably creeped out. But the new Supreme's voice (to say nothing of the size, paintjob or shape) really grated on my nerves, and then between the Spitfires in space (at five minutes notice, no less) and the Oblivion Continuum that could be talked out of exploding, well, I was about ready to give up on the series completely (having been really disappointed with The Beast Below the week before after the mostly excellent The Eleventh Hour). But I thought I'd hold out at least until after the two-part River Song/Weeping Angels extravaganza, and I'm glad I did, because the series went from strength to strength after that (with the sole exception of the disappointing Homo Reptilia/Silurian redesign).

Still, I'd love to see the Daleks rested for a year or two and brought back with some minor design tweaks if not a complete redesign. They're used far too much and they've lost all tehir menace. Sadly though, I think a condition of the BBC being allowed to use them was that they have to be in every series, so it looks like we'll just have to put up with them.

I am in full agreement with you. We each have our own opinion on episodes.

&gt;far and away the best written finale, IMO.

I still think the season 2 finale is the best one, but my second favorite (if I overlook the screwdriver paradox) is indeed the 5th season one.

&gt; I don't think there was a single episode that I would skip if rewatching it

There are the episodes I would skip, across all seasons :

Season 1 ) The Unquiet Dead

Season 2 ) The Idiot's Lantern and Fear Her

Season 3 ) The Shakespear Code

Season 4 ) The Unicorn and the Wasp

Specials ) Planet of the Dead

Season 5 ) Victory of the Dalek, The Vampire of Venice, The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood except for the last 5 minutes of Cold Blood.


Even my then 7 year old daughter (she's 8 now) who loves the daleks hated Victory of the Dalek.

I found the Vampire of Venice not to be as bad as the other skipped episodes, I grant you that. It's mostly his speech at the end which kills the show for me.

Hungry Earth and Cold Blood, I just hated them.

But if I look at those I put in the ""rewatch"" list, I have The Beast Below  which barely made the cut for me. The first 20 minutes were amazing enough and the conclusion, even if disappointing, did have a lot more promise than most of the first 4 season episodes.

Time of Angels and Flesh of Stone ruined Blink for me, my favorite episode.

Vincent and the Doctor however, are in my top 5. It's simply amazing. Amy's choice is also pretty darn interesting.

And the Lodger ? I take it at the 11th doctor's equivalent to the Doctor Lite episodes like Love &amp; Monster. It's a low budget show there to finance the finale and in that aspect, it was amazing.

true,colcob,null,null,"I've always rather disliked the knee-jerk 'exams are getting easier' fuss we have every year, mostly because it seems rather ill informed and short on real analysis.  But I looked into the stats a bit more deeply this year and cant avoid thinking that the system has got a bit fucked.

The fundamental problem is that in a given year of rising grades, it's very very difficult (maybe impossible) to statistically prove how much of that rise was due to better education, and how much was due to easier exams.

On the one hand if you invest in education and make concrete steps to give kids BETTER education, then you would expect to see them getting better results, but on the other hand, if you normalise all results so that the same percentage of entrants get an A,B, C etc. each year (like they used to do), then you allow accurate comparisons within a cohort, but you can't demonstrate rising standards.   

So grade levels are now pegged to percentage marks to allow 'rising standards' to be demonstrated (not wrong in and of itself), but then we also have a system of school league tables having undue prominence, and crucially, a privatised multi-provider exam board system (and that's the real kicker).  So schools under pressure to raise standards can choose to purchase exams from companies under pressure to sell more exams.  The rest is market forces.

Personally, I think that league table should be weakened somewhat, that the information they contain should become more generic, and that the schools performance should have less effect on their budget, and that exam board should either be nationalised, or that providers should bid to central government for each subject so that the whole country takes the same exam in a given subject for the period of each contract.

Competition between boards and schools wanting the best pupils with their adverts being the average pass rate, to me, sounds like the ideal situation for potential corruption of examinations to practically guarantee a school higher pass marks if they take their exam.

A better option would be to have one single exam board which oversees all GCSE/A Level examinations. The current boards could be somehow merged into one and draw upon the experience they have to create a significantly improved examination system which would be able to work nationwide and provide a better quality service without the risk of corruption as all schools would have the same board.

Given that the Government seems to want to have some role in the education system, I think some form of examination department for the education system would probably contribute positively to the current mess of the whole of England's academics situation just now.

Similarly, it gives schools the freedom to change exam board if they fall into disagreement about the exam structure and/or marking.

This could easily be remedied by still having multiple providers, but nationalising them to make them non-profit, or have one provider but force them to offer lots of different specifications for each subject so schools can choose.

First, I'll say that after a good long while of decrying Matt Smith, the ending of The Pandorica Opens is one of my favorite scenes.  Though it's not the actual finale, it does this amazing danger of finality to it.  We so often see the Doctor in absolute peril that we become desensitized to it, but when he's faced with the Pandorica, his cool demeanor slips just a little.  He's actually afraid of the prison for a moment, I think not because he's worried about the end of the universe, but because a prison is the absolute worst punishment for our beloved Doctor.  His scrambling feet as he is dragged to the Pandorica, the cut away to a soft music, the onlooking gaze of all the Doctor's often thwarted foes delighting in actual moral superiority however misplaced.  It's a marvelous scene.

Still, David Tennant broke my heart so many times.  His monologue while Wilf is in the nuclear bolt, his vignettes of saying goodbye, and the ""Vale Decem"" scene reduce me to a jibbering idiot.  Even the echo of the Tenth Doctor appearing in The Eleventh Hour sends chills down my spine, since you can still see the pain and sorrow in his eyes.

I think the biggest problem with the current system is that you don't learn about the subject, you learn how to pass the exam. This means that a lot of people with As and Bs don't actually have competence in the subject, they just have good exam skills.

For example, my brother. He's starting his A2s. He wants to apply to do Politics at uni because he did well in the exam, but he'll hate it. He thinks he's good at it because he cracked how to do essay writing for History and Politics really well. They're still hard subjects, but once you do what he did, it becomes much easier to even bullshit your way through most answers.

So on top of having a grading issue, the grades might not truly prepare and show a student's capacity within their subject, I think that's even more fucked.

She also clearly has a thing for Captain Yates (who off-screen later turns out to be gay), and seems to fancy a number of different men over various episodes before finally deciding to marry one.  It shows how much even progressing societies still were hung with old moralities; a married woman simply wasn't allowed to go gallavanting around the universe with a strange man.  Amy and Rory will be the first married couple in the TARDIS, which shows just how far we've come.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Series 1 is the first Who episode I ever watched, quite by accident while channel flipping. It was a huge ""save the entire universe"" but it didn't feel as over the top as everything since then has. I liked it a lot, though I was a little pissed/hurt at the end, having had no previous Who knowledge going into it and had no idea about regeneration, etc. Here was the first episode I'd ever seen, was really getting into it and loving this Doctor, and then he was gone and who's that new guy? After that, I went back and watched all of Series 1 before the Christmas special... David still took a few episodes to grow on me after that.

Series 2 was great, made me cry, but it has since been completely ruined with Rose's perpetual returning again and again. 

Series 3 I liked a lot, until we goto Doctor House Elf and floaty-psychic-powers. 

Series 4 just felt huge and overdone, and again, more Rose garbage, human doctor, wtf crap... The final scene with Donna was great, and there were some moments that felt very Nazi death camp that were downright creepy for me on a psychological level.... but again, it was ruined by cheese. I accept, enjoy, and have come to expect mild to moderate amounts of cheese in my Doctor Who. It's one of its endearing qualities, but that was just too much.

End of Time was... well, it was just all over the place. The Master's resurrection scene made no sense and was stupidly executed/poorly written. All the stuff with Wilf was great, except for the whole star wars battle scene. The ending, while I can understand the point of it, dragged on too long, I felt.

Series 5 - At first, I was a bit  annoyed with all of the paradoxical time jumping around back and forth in his own time line because, essentially, as Moffat himself has admitted, it's cheating. But once I got over that and just enjoyed it, it was great fun.

I'm not anti-Rose. I liked her a lot as a companion. I just think she should have stayed gone when she left the first time.

""The Government does not believe decriminalisation of cannabis is the right approach. Our priorities are clear - we want to reduce drug use, crack down on drug-related crime and disorder and help addicts come off drugs for good.""

This really grinds my gears.

Firstly, evidence and studies have shown that [Cannabis is less a dependable drug than caffeine ffs.](http://www.druglibrary.org/SCHAFFER/library/basicfax5.htm) &lt;Edit--Evidence shows that Cannabis stimulates brain cell growth, while nicotine and alcohol do the complete opposite. And currently, other non-that-make-you-stoned chemicals that are in Cannabis have been shown to attack and kill 5 cancerous tumours. It's also said that if Scientists were to discover Cannabis tomorrow it would be hailed as the most miraculous discovery ever due to its medicinal applications. But man, the pharmaceutical companies would hate that--Edit&gt;

Also, remember the Scientists that quit their job after constantly not being listened to by the government? I like how it was a 'Home Office spokeman' that seemed to have so much knowledge of Cannabis as opposed to the Scientists that quit due to idiots that currently sit in Parliament. 

I hate it when people say that cannabis is addictive when it is not. Alcohol is much more addictive! I once asked a friend ""Do you agree that Cannabis is illegal?"" to which he replied ""Yea. Well it makes you paranoid dunnit?""

Fucking idiot. Alcohol makes you aggressive; make it illegal. Cheeseburgers make you fat; make it illegal. 

I like how people think that if Cannabis was ever legalised that EVERYONE WOULD BE SMOKING NON STOP OMG EVERYONE WOULD BE STONED ALL THE TIME. No one would be forcing people to smoke it, but it would mean that people like me wouldn't feel guilty and a criminal for smoking a fucking plant.
