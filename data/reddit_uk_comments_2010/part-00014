There is a chance his name in Time Lord society is not his real name.

However, nothing has actually contradicted this in the new series.  His name may be a reference to this.

I think that his name being hidden is just there to add some mystery to his character.  This was the original goal of the Cartmel Masterplan.

For example, [Dunblane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_massacre) (17 dead) or the [Virginia Tech shootings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech_shootings) (32 dead) were ""mass"" shootings because many people died, and the objective was clearly to kill as many people as possible indiscriminately.

Four people injured by gunfire is not a ""mass"" shooting.  If that were the case then every drive-by, gang-related incident and even some armed robberies would count, and that's clearly silly.

&gt; and yes it probably is gang related but im not adding speculation until facts are reported.

Indeed - I didn't suggest you should.  Rather, I was just highlighting that by ""mass shooting"" people usually imply:

1. A lot of deaths or injuries, and/or
2. Indiscriminate choice of targets

And (1 obviously being non-applicable) the gang-related point was to point out you didn't even know if the second, weaker implication was valid (if that was your rationale for using the word).

&gt; if its not a mass shooting how many would we need to have shot before we report it as a mass shooting?

Until a few more than four people had been hurt.  Until that point it's ""a shooting"".  Mass is an adjective to suggest a *lot*... and four people getting *wounded* by gunfire (especially in a large crowd of a thousand or more) is not a lot at all.

true,Bananageddon,null,null,"First up, the general premise of the article, that you ""spread"" the Tory vote across the nation so they had the same proportion of the vote in each constituency that they did nationally is just plain mental. Exactly what the hell is that supposed to prove? That the Tory vote is stronger in some areas than others? That 36.9% of the vote won't win you a seat in lots of places? Well, no shit. Try doing the same thing with Labour's 29% of the vote. Doesn't play well for them either. 

Then we have:

&gt;What effect would the knife have had on the result? The Liberal Democrats would have won 72 seats instead of 57. Labour's number would have stayed the same overall at 258 and the Conservatives would have won only 293 rather than 305. A Lib-Lab coalition could have commanded 330 seats instead of the measly 315 that was contemplated as a block.

The implication here is that we have been cheated out of a Lib-Lab pact by the geographical imbalance of the vote. First up, even if you're willing to buy into New Statesman's batshit mental knife theory, is a very slim majority of 330 seats really that much better than a minority of 315? It's not exactly strong. 

Then there's this bit:

&gt;That the Conservatives won the largest minority of seats in a general election, while seeing the greatest increase in support where they needed it the least, shows how little empathy most people in Tory shires now feel for those who live in the cities, or the north, or the countries outside of England.

Obviously the Tory share of the vote will increase more in areas where they're already strong. You might as well say that Labour did worse in areas where they were already weak. All that's showing is that politics is fucking tribal. That there's divides between town and country, north and south, England and the rest of the union. Well, duh. 

The article is doing the same thing most Labour apologists were doing after the election, trying to paint things in terms of Tory and Not-Tory, like Lib Dem voters are just Labour supporters who're being a bit silly, and that Labour knows what's best for them. Simple fact is that Labour didn't have the votes or the seats to be contenders any more. They lost. 

What really pisses me off about this is that Labour desperately need to get their shit together if there's to be a worthwhile opposition to this coalition (as there needs to be). They're not going to do that by whining about an election they lost fair and square.

I'm sure all 12 year olds deal with sexual frustration, depression, morally ambiguous torture and Being A Craig.

&gt;Sonic screwdriver fixes everything

Except in *Vincent and the Doctor* when OH. IT DOESN'T.

&gt;acting is so atrociously obvious

I've seen Matt Smith in other works, and I can say nope. Not. I love Karen Gillian's acting and Tony Curran's as Vincent Van Gogh was beautiful.

&gt;Previous themes had subtlety

Quite frankly I thought the Jacketed Doctor was beautifully subtle, and several other things that have occurred.

&gt;characters had great lines and parts

I really can't decide here.

**The Doctor:** Dr Black? We met a few days ago; I asked you about The Church at Auvers.   
**Dr Black:** Ah, yes; glad to be of help. You were nice about my tie.   
**The Doctor:** And today is another cracker if I may say so.

**Craig:** That was amazing! Where'd you learn to cook?   
**The Doctor:** Paris, 18th Century... no, that's not recent, is it? I meant 17th, no, 20th. Sorry, not used to doing them in the right order.   
**Craig:** Has anyone ever told you that you're a bit weird?   
**The Doctor:** They never really stop.

&gt;all had complexity.

You're comparing characters that had more than one series to develop to, I'm assuming Amy, who hasn't. And yet, she's more than complex! she's formed an emotional attachment to a Doctor who was there for her when she was seven. 

&gt;The Crack was so obvious

Good god. How many times does it have to be said? The Crack was *not meant to be subtle*. The reasons behind the Crack were dealt with in episode five and then expanded upon in episode nine. Well before the series finale.

There are other things at work that the Crack is causing, but you cannot equate the Crack to Bad Wolf. And you know how it's better than Bad Wolf? Because it makes sense. Oh goody, we heard/saw references to Bad Wolf and Mr. Saxon, but they made no sense until the final.

It's always interesting to see how others are interpreting the show, and sometimes opinions can bring about intriguing discussions.

&gt; Eccleston and Tennant were great and had enough personality differences to put their own stamp on the character.

I would have to disagree with you on this count. I think Matt Smith is doing a fantastic job of making the character his own. It's a lot of little things, but most specifically, it's that he continually does/says things that bring about the alienness of the Doctor, more so than I think Eccleston or Tennant did. I like it.

&gt; This current series is aimed at a 12 year old and under market...new daleks look like toys 

(little editing there to keep thoughts together) I'm not sure about the aim. Some things feel like they're dumbed down (like beating us over the head with the Crack) but overall I'm not sure there's more or less explanation to things that have been happening. I will say, a lot this season I've felt the explanations have been less than satisfactory, but I wouldn't say that's because the show is aimed at 12 year olds.

&gt; Sonic screwdriver fixes everything

You know when in ""The Lodger"" Smith specifically said, ""Can't sonic, that'd give myself away""? The fact that the first thought I had was ""Thank goodness he's can't! I'm *tired* of him waving it around all the time - and not as if it's a scanner, as if it's his weapon for protection. I don't mind the new scannery side of it, I think that's pretty cool. I am tired of it being out all the time though. It does feel like the writers this season have been using it as a crutch.

&gt; and the acting is so atrociously obvious.
Not sure about this one. I think Matt Smith does a great job with the acting. I really liked Arthur Darvill too - he played that Rory so perfectly. Alex Kingston did well with River, but I'm not too big a fan of the character so yeah. Guests like Tony Curran and Bill Nighy were also great. Honestly, the one person's acting I've been unimpressed by is Karen Gillan. Her Amy seems to have about one, maybe two facial expressions, and she seems awkward when interacting with a lot of the other actors. To me, she seems to be ""playing the part"" rather than embracing and *becoming* the character.

&gt; Previous themes had subtlety,

I'm waiting until the end of this seasons to make any decisions about the subtleties of this season. I will say though - in previous seasons I was watching for things (I LOVE to speculate!), but also enjoying the show. In this season (perhaps because of the reputation Moffat has/is building) it feels like everything has to be second-guessed. It's harder to enjoy the ""show"" when I'm busy wondering what's going to be changed/altered/important to the overall arc/what lines are important, etc. At any rate, I'm not sure this can be judged until the the season is over.

&gt; characters had great lines and parts,

While subjective, I don't think this season has had any more or less than previous ones.

&gt; Captain Jack a amoral, bisexual space conman and Mickey realising he was the tin dog before developing into a guardian of the planet, Donna, Rose, Martha all had complexity.

Well...Rory is roughly the only comparable character this season, and I was really excited to see what was going to develop there. So much for that. (for now?) I think the writers have tried to give Amy complexity, but it seems so mishandled that it's just frustrating more than anything else. (I think, at least.)  

&gt; The Doctor and Amy are just insipid,



&gt; The Crack was so obvious, not like Bad Wolf. I mean River Song has practically given it away.

Again, I think it's too early to make a call on that. Yes, the Crack in the universe is obvious, but we have little else on that, other than River's clue about the Pandorica. As far as why it's there, what or who caused it, and anything about Pandorica, we know little. So, for a theme, I don't think it's too bad. 

&gt; Then they returned to the best new monsters in a long time, Angels, and made them, well ordinary and a bit silly.

Yeah, I was terrified of the Angels after ""Blink"". After that two-parter? A resounding *meh*. And I'm a person who doesn't watch horror movies (or honestly, even the dumb teen slasher movies) because they scare me/give me fodder to scare myself). 


I feel my biggest complaint about this season is that the writing seems sloppy. It feels like writers are trying to add in so much that they lose some of the impact that could be there. For instance, it seems like there is much more ""telling, not showing"" this season, which takes away a lot from a show. It also feels like there's some character development, but it's not always consistent...different writers seem to be unclear on things a character may or may not be inclined to do (shouldn't Moffat, as head writer, be able to make that less so though?) Monster explanations, and even a few of the monsters themselves, seem a bit weak or ineffective (not all, mind you, but some of them.) I don't know if the writers are trying to do too much, as a way to prove they don't need RDT, but they seem to be overdoing a lot, and missing a lot of subtle nuances that add to the story.

But yeah, I'll wait until the finale to see how it all plays out. :) ",0,1276635793,null,0,true,0,c0s64c7,t3_cf8y0,t1_c0s64c7,t3_cf8y0,null,1426344002,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

&gt; People keep complaining about this, but I can honestly say I haven't noticed excess sonicing.

I think the reason I notice is because of the noise it makes. He's having an intense conversation and that sonicing noise is in the background. It's weird because I'm not usually bothered by sounds like that. I think I notice because I'm usually thinking, 'why is he even sonicing now, it's not doing anything, it's not protection or anything, and now it's hard to hear what's being said'. He never looks at it after any of that either, so I can't believe he's just been scanning that whole time. I think that in past episodes the screwdriver has threatened as a weapon of protection, but not necessarily been used...so I don't know if this is a sign of the Doctor being a bit insecure with himself, and so it's reassuring to know the screwdriver is there, or what.

&gt; Although I still don't like the way they [the Angels] were moving so slowly.

So agreed. It added suspense, sure, but was so...opposite of what had been there before. On of the DW blogs I read suggested that Moffat wanted to ""turn inside out"" the rules we knew about the Angels, and have an episode where a character has to keep eyes closed instead of open, but also involve the Angels somehow - them being slow seemed to be one of the only ways to let that happen. Regardless, I could probably watch those episodes again, but I don't know if I will ever watch ""Blink"" again!

Synopsis
The Doctor has always admired the work of William Shakespeare. So he is a little surprised that Charley doesn't hold the galaxy's greatest playwright in the same esteem. In fact she's never heard of him.

Which the Doctor thinks is quite impossible.

General Mariah Learman, ruling Britain after the Eurowars, is one of Shakespeare's greatest admirers, and is convinced her time machine will enable her to see the plays' original performances.

Which the Doctor believes is extremely unlikely.

The Daleks just want to help. They want Learman to get her time machine working. They want Charley to appreciate the first ever performance of Julius Caesar They believe that Shakespeare is the greatest playwright ever to have existed and venerate his memory.

Which the Doctor knows is utterly impossible.

I think the limit should be zero or very close to zero so that those drinking the night before aren't expected to not drive for 24 hours to let it all disappear. There's no need to drink and drive at all. One life saved is not a waste by dropping the limit.

I actually think there's been a few hints throughout the a few episodes, that the writers know the sonic screwdriver is being over used and they are gradually taking steps to rectify that. There's it being broken when being used against the atraxi, Amy calling it rubbish because it can't do wood, and the lodger where the Doctor actually says 'mustn't sonic'.

I've been watching the season 2 recently. If you want to see Sonic Screwdriver overuse, go there. It's never out of ten's hands. It's even used to break a rope ladder at one stage.

Last year I had suffered some problems with the universities online system and my marks changing half-way through the summer. My university was more than happy to fail me because they had not received my correct exam marks (and had lost the papers themselves) after being given my provisional marks claiming that I had passed everything. It took legal help and two months of this year to fight to be able to take those two classes again this year with the rest of my final year classes. The kicker is that throughout this year they have finally acknowledged the problem as it has affected all my final year classes, but I'm still taking a huge load of credits this year with a ton of exams. My legal representative (from the University of Exeter, because my university couldn't cover me) helped me talk to my university and write an appeal and complaint to the OIA, but luckily the university decided against attempting to fail me and retake (and pay) for the classes again before it got that far. They weren't happy about letting me take it with my third year and when I met with the student representatives they would often claim that I couldn't take these classes in my third year. I was even called a liar recently when my online profile broke and removed me from a class again, resulting in another complaint to the university.

For a lot of students it's not really about the money, it's about the time that one must invest in university, including the time to pay off the debt. Unless you're at a top 10-20 university there's a good chance that you're feeling cheated by your university.

If I knew what I did now I would have probably held off attending university for a few years. The level of education is pretty poor, the facilities are often barely above what you'd find at a local comprehensive and the universities themselves are often so strictly bureaucratic that the simplest problem will result in students being ignored or failed for problems that could be easily resolved.

She's a gender-swapped version of the Doctor. I'm not saying she IS the Doctor, or anything like that -- I'm saying she acts just like him. And people don't like that.

That is why I love River Song. She's not concerned with what people think of her, any more than the Doctor is, and I love her for it. I love her BECAUSE she's a smug asshole.

true,harvey-birdman,null,null,"Pension funds work by taking pension contributions and investing it into something. That investment gives a return which is used to pay back pensioners. 

One type of investment is to buy shares. If the share price goes up then selling them can give a return. Also, just holding on to the shares can give you rights to dividend payments by the company.

Many pension funds hold shares in BP because it's seen as a safe investment; BP isn't expected to fail. So huge amounts of divident payments are being made (as jmzhodge said it's £1 in every £7, which means out of all the top 100 companies on the FTSE, BP is paying so much in dividends that it accounts for 1/7th of all dividend payments). Many of those payments are going towards pension funds.

If BP doesn't do well then it can't make any dividend payments, it will need to conserve money for itself. When that happens it means pension funds are receiving less even though they already paid for shares. 

Thus, if BP suffers financially then it harms pension funds. 

edit: also note; when people mention pension funds it doesn't mean just employees and ex-employees of BP. Employees anywhere and of any company can choose a particular pension fund to contribute to, which will then pay back later. So all sorts of pension funds representing all sorts of people across the country have invested in shares in BP.

&gt; I just don't see what place Doctor Who or Merlin have in his article. Which would otherwise be excellent.

Read the article.

&gt; ""The only drama the BBC will boast about are Merlin and Doctor Who, which are fine, but they're children's programmes. They're not for adults.

&gt; ""And they're very good children's programmes, don't get me wrong, they're wonderfully written … but they are not for adults.

The only reason Doctor Who was mentioned was because those are the top shows in the adult programming time block. 

Doctor Who is not intended to be a serious, mature, prime time drama. But that and Merlin and Ashes to Ashes are the best prime time examples the BBC can be proud about right now. Fry is asking for Law &amp; Order and instead he is getting Warehouse 13. 

You can argue all day about how great the steamed fish is but if they're ordering Steak, they're not gonna care how great the damn fish is, it's just not what they are craving. 

If you still don't understand how Fry's terrible attack on Doctor Who was in fact a large criticism of BBC and not an attack on Doctor Who at all then you're hopeless. If you read the article you'd realize that the names Doctor Who and Merlin were uttered by Fry *once* and the rest of the article focused on his actual point. 

&gt; Family friendly ≠ children's show. Just because kids can enjoy it, it doesn't mean there's an absence of certain questionable morals that should be present in a adult show. Sure, it can sometimes approach them superficially, but it's family friendly, and it's viewing hour projects that suitability.

Does that description accurately describe the kind of shows Fry and those like him are asking for? No. We can argue all day about the fine line Doctor Who balances between Family and Kid programming but it doesn't change the whole *point* of the article and the *fact* that the show is *not* what Fry is asking for in Adult TV.

What I said is that there is a *lack* of reality based drama in Doctor Who. There's no need to twist that into some deranged statement that Adult TV *must be based in reality*. 

However, shows that are poignant to modern society and recent events are desired by just about everyone, but specifically adults who pay attention to the world they live in. The fact that there is a lack of that kind of programming is an issue and Doctor Who does not fill that gap. 

No one said Adults don't like escapism or that they can only think of 'realistic' fantasies. All I said is Doctor Who fails to be poignant in any *meaningful* way to current , real events.

It just seemed very right. Now, considering the Doctor is still the same person, just regenerated, he's not going to have forgotten Rose so quickly. Although, i have never heard Matt Smith's Doctor reference any of the old characters, like Rose, Micky, Jackie, Captain Jack.

It can be about a time and space traveler who is always trying to do the right thing, while at the same time showing The Doctor as miserable over his memories of destroying entire civilizations, a lonely god who keeps companions to maintain his sanity and compassion and empathy when all the time he is tempted both by the awesome power that a Time Lord can wield, and the tantalizing notion of settling down and living out a normal life the way that the Metacrisis Doctor was able to.

SKY TV, has everythin, movies/sports/discovery channel ect.

If it'd started there, I'd actually call myself a fan of torchwood. But I'm waiting until the new episodes to see how they go. 

That said, after children of earth, I was impressed enough to give all the other episodes I hadn't seen a chance. And there were a couple that really stood out for me. I thought suzie's return was really touching. And even if unintentional, a nice comment on relation to death as an atheist. If not in quite the same psychotic way, I remember what it was like going from certainty of an afterlife to being fairly certain that this one shot is all there is. And how over night the concept of staying alive took on such a vastly greater significance. 

The old man on his death bed, I thought, was another really good look at the subject of life, death, aging, and the nature of finding meaning within each of them.

By jove, I think we've been looking at this the wrong way.

At first I was thinking that the Pandorica housed an evil, later version of the Doctor (the Valeyard?), which they release when they open it. This was based on a number of hints:

We know the Doctor has an evil side, as proven in 'Amy's Choice', confirmed by Karen Gillan as the most important episode with regards to overall plot.

We know River Song kills the best man she's ever known (see 'Flesh and Stone'). Why would she kill the Doctor (if that is indeed who she means) unless he had turned evil?

We know the Pandorica holds 'the most feared being in all the cosmos', 'a goblin, a trickster or a warrior, soaked in the blood of a thousand universes' (see preview of 'next week' from 'The Lodger'). This certainly sounds like it could be a reference to the Doctor - 'The Oncoming Storm', in his own words (see 'The Lodger').

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

However, now we have some more information, there is another way to look at this:

From the sfx website:

&gt;The Doctor and Amy visit the oldest planet in the universe, where the first words in history have a familiar ring to them.

Note it does not mention *when* they visit this planet. What if they visit it *at the beginning*, and the first words in history are uttered by the Doctor, or Amy, or River Song (they are familiar, remember?).

I think that the Doctor gets put in the Pandorica *at the beginning of the universe* by his enemies (Daleks, Cybermen, etc, who we know all turn up in the next two weeks. See [this pic](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xbEkkUyXTtc/TAOSPYiuKoI/AAAAAAAAAQI/3hYnfEn8q5Q/s1600/Untitled-1.png) from next weeks episode and the 'next week' from last week(!) which mentions Daleks, Cybermen, Santoran, Slitheen, Jalonian?, Nestene, and Draven, and [this concept art from the ending](http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/8/2010/06/original.jpg) as backup - we have the Doctor in the Pandorica, Daleks, Jadoon, and at least two others I can't name at this point - one seems to be Roman soldiers. The Doctor's enemies would obviously label him as the most feared being in all the cosmos, or something similar.

This is also supported by this, from sfx:

&gt;The Pandorica does indeed open.

&gt;It also closes.

It opens to allow the Doctor to be forced inside (as per the preview pic) and then closes on him, (as per the  concept art), trapped for eternity (supposedly)?

For Amy, and River? and Rory? to escape from this planet at the beginning of time, someone else would have to pilot the TARDIS:

&gt;Someone other than the Doctor pilots the TARDIS.

Oh, okay.

All this might well explain the references to 'the Doctor in the TARDIS', as opposed to 'the Doctor in the Pandorica' maybe? While all that we have been watching has been going on, there has been another Doctor, trapped in the Pandorica for millenia, since the beginning of time.

We know that this series is based on 'Time Loops' (see interview with Karen Gillan which I can't locate just now!), and Moffat has a thing about time, and how the Doctor's experience of time differs from the humans he meets (see 'The Girl in the Fireplace/ Blink/ most of this series)

I think that somehow the deal with Amy, and Rory's death, is linked to what happens to get the Doctor imprisoned, and subsequently released **a lot** later, and this also somehow causes the crack we have been seeing. I will update once I have watched all the old episodes (!?!?!)

So that is my basic idea, which I plan to expand on after rewatching what has already happened. Thoughts?

Dispersants are actually a *very* big part of this. It was obvious from the start that this spill would not be stopped immediately. There would be a **huge** amount of oil entering the environment, and the main problem with the spill isn't the fact that the reserve is emptying, but that it is emptying into the environment. The only way to prevent that oil from causing the problems it is now causing would be the use of dispersants - dispersants that do not cause as much damage to the environment as the oil does (which is *very* debatable as far as the dispersants used by BP)

It is one thing to plug the hole, but if the already spilled oil could be prevented from causing the harm it *is already* causing, then that would release BP from the drastic pressure it is facing. NOFO stated they could disperse 90% of the oil being released, without the damage to the environment caused by the dispersants BP were using, so almost eliminating the damage altogether, and giving BP the time it needed to solve the problem logically, instead of the panicking, half-hearted response we have seen so far from BP.",0,1276816347,null,0,true,0,c0sc26p,t3_cfk7m,t1_c0sc26p,t1_c0s8n27,null,1426346774,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

She's obviously brilliant -- they don't hand out Professorships/tenure in Cracker Jack boxes -- and he obviously respects that. That interests him. He likes a challenge, a puzzle, and River is nothing *but* a puzzle, sizzling with snark and wending her timey-wimey way around his life and putting him off-balance. He's bitchy with her now because she has an advantage over him, she's seen it all before, literally; I think when the tables are turned and he's the one who knows her better than she knows him, we'll see his attitude toward her change.

I much prefer River being his near-equal than Rose snuggling up to cute bishie Ten and being so cutey-wooty it made me barf, or Martha pining after the Doctor and being a limp dishrag until it became plot-necessary for her to become a badass alien fighter. Donna was awesome, now -- she lived *alongside* the Doctor, not *for* the Doctor. She wasn't in love with him, but she loved him. She wasn't defined by her relationship to him -- she wanted the stars for her own reasons, not because they came with him as a package deal.

I think maybe the reason I like River is that she *is* special. She's larger than life, but I don't find that that in any way diminishes the specialness of any companion before her. It's like explaining poly relationships to monogamous people -- I don't love any of my partners any less than the others, but I do love them differently. 

And yes, the dynamic has changed, but so has the Doctor. River may be exactly what he needs this time around. I hope so, because I love seeing her be a bitchy smug dick to him while you know, you just know, she loves him to pieces and because she loves him, she won't tolerate his bullshit.

I think part of the problem is that creationists, Mormons and the religious right in the USA (let's lump them all under the heading of ""crazies"") only exist as such a powerful force because they have cradle-to-grave coverage - kids are raised in crazy families, attend crazy schools, go to crazy universities and then either:

* enter the workplace and discover that the stock answer ""magic man done it"" has hamstrung their education and left them woefully unprepared for modern life in the modern world... or
* go to work for a crazy company and never, ever even get *exposed* to sane, rational or even moderate ideas... so they continue to believe in and vote for even things which are batshit insane... and then raise a subsequent generation of kids who largely end up doing the same.

TL:DR: Schools are to *teach* kids *facts*, not indoctrinate them into bullshit.  I at least largely trust the education system, trained teachers, OFSTED and the like to stick relatively close to this ideal, no matter that they may miss the mark occasionally.

With the USA as a prime example of what happens when you take your eye off the ball and allow people to create environments where they can believe whatever they like for their entire lives effectively uncontested, and with the creeping influx of creationism and ID-proponents into the UK over the last few years, I do *not* trust any old group of parents and people with a strong agenda that the school system is not promoting to do the same.",0,1276867711,null,0,false,0,c0sdfzg,t3_cgces,t1_c0sdfzg,t3_cgces,null,1426347434,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I'm saying that I didn't notice whether or not she was (say) wearing a miniskirt until the Daily Mail made an article about it, and then completely forgot about it again. You're right, I wasn't reading reddit's (or Something Awful's, or any dedicated outlet's) coverage of Doctor Who at that point. I didn't consider her to be intentionally sexualised then, and I still don't. She seems like a perfectly normal girl to me (yes, she's flighty and vaguely traumatised, but I hang around a lot of flighty and more-than-vaguely traumatised people); maybe it's just that I'm currently living in climates warmer than England (not as warm as Rio), but I'm used to miniskirts and shorts on ladies and gents.

Unfortunately, lots of males (by no means all, nor even all heterosexuals!) are obsessed with objectifying girls (not intentionally; it's just social programming) to the point that they'll fantasise about any one that looks (to their standards) pretty. Thus, the lots of comments about Amy's prettiness (and sure, she's gorgeous—but we don't need to be reminded of that every post-episode discussion; I mean, the Doctor's lovely-looking, too, but I don't see as many upvotes for such a statement). It's not because the programme's presenting her that way; it's just fandom being fandom.

That's just my opinion, though (and that of my also-feminist and slightly-more-third-wave sort-of-girlfriend); if you do consider Ms Pond to be too sexualised and not a positive role model, then I absolutely understand your frustration with the show in context. :-)

EDIT: If I had children, I certainly wouldn't let them watch the show, but not because of Amy Pond: I was terrified enough as a child without Doctor Who, and I'm a bit too soft to inflict, say, Weeping Angels or shadows-that-melt-the-flesh on other children :-P

Second, it drove me nuts that she came in alongside Donna in particular. Yeah, the other girls were just kinda swooning over the Doc but as you said, Donna was definitely not. She was the one who was so much more easily relate-able, and I'd say it was during her time on the cast that I really fell in love with the show because of that quality.

Now, let me be clear - I don't dislike River's character or her behavior. I dislike the role she suddenly assumes in the Doctor's life in comparison to everyone else. I love seeing the closeness grow between the Doctor and his companions and it always seems like this precious thing that's developing, but then River comes along and it feels like she flaunts this completely different level of intimacy than anyone else... It feels shitty, even though she's not shitty herself.

Point of comparison: it's as if my current boyfriend/best friend and I broke up in the future and he went on to meet and marry someone who puts me to shame and was absolutely perfect for him and they go off on all these crazy adventures together. And then she grabs a time machine and drops in on us when we're on vacation in the present day. I mean, obviously it's apples and oranges, and you have to accept that people lead their own lives, but just having this big boisterous piece of evidence that what we have is so majorly dwarfed by something that comes later, that I can't even touch, would be so horrible. Even if we desperately needed her there, even if she made everything better and was the perfect person to be there at exactly the right time.

Yeah, that's an extreme example, but that's the kind of role I feel like she's been given, and while I think her character isn't bad (in all reality I feel pretty neutral about her) and I can't blame the writers for coming up with such an interesting plot twist, I'm just a bit resentful of the role she's been given for the sake of the women traveling with the doctor.",0,1276881831,null,0,false,0,c0se20w,t3_cfang,t1_c0se20w,t1_c0sd5w7,null,1426347720,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

Contrary to what the series presented in that last episode, the novels **between** the two series paints a slightly different picture.

1) the Pandorica is a prison which is for the worst of the worst. Which means its an evil equal to the doctor, or the ultimate good. 
     a) We've already seen the doctors dark side (Amy's Choice) 
     b) We've seen evidence of a time loop (The Lodger)
     c) The Doctor did something extraordinarily kind for someone who had a rather lonely and miserable life (Vincent and the Doctor) 

2) Chances are that the Pandorica contains someone that is from the doctors past, perhaps dealing with the time lock that has the time war. Possibly someone who thrives on paradox. 


That being said, there is a possibility that the Doctor and other Time Lords survived the Time War. Perhaps its a Time Lord from before they were.. civilized? A Time Lord prior to when there were rules.

On Another note. I also think this may be likely

The Pandorica is empty, and captures the Doctor - As the Doctor and the Tardis are pretty much bound to each other this causes the Tardis to die, that explosion causes the cracks in the universe. It also causes a time loop where the doctor must figure out a way to avoid becoming trapped in the Pandorica whilst the barriers between universes collapse as well.

In the first episode, Prisoner Zero enters in little Amelia's mind and copies all the stuff.

After few years, the Doctor's perception of reality is perturbed by the Prisoner Zero (in a ""Dreamlordy"" way) with the puppet-master: Prisoner Zero impersonating Amelia.

Now she calls herself Amy (it resembled a ""I'm a grown-up, I'm not into fairy-tales"" attitude), the crack on her wall (still scary and too-recently-closed) is the most feared thing in the universe, some things don't even make sense (Jacketed Doctor appears out of nowhere from the Byzantium episode to calm her ; Rory isn't wiped from history, he's just another roman warriors).

Now cracks appear everywhere where the Doctor is because Amy's also there, and it's still one of her greatest fears and she's unknowing kind-of-a-controller. 

As River discovered, Amy and Rory in a roman costume is not a new image, because that were her favourite stuff in the first years: ""The Pandora Legend"", ""The Roman Culture"", ""The Doctor"" and ""The childhood boyfriend who cosplayed the Doctor - Rory"".

Really off the chart theory: Rory pulls a Doctor outfit and saves the whoniverse.

Company's exist to make profit. If you decrease your overheads (bandwidth, servers, people to run those servers) and increase revenues (through subscriptions) then you make more money.

Sure they lose money on Internet advertisers going elsewhere but I think when they did the sums, there wasn't a huge amount of revenue to be had there anyway. People weren't clicking the ads!

I'm not sure that this idea is as dumb as the hive-mind thinks it is. 

Imagine being able to get a subscription to all News International content for $100 a year. I suspect many people would think that represents good value. 

Better yet, in the Internet world, giving their customers this option costs them next to nothing - there's no paper to buy, print and distribute. They already have the journalists from their print business!

Let's say that they only managed to net a million subscribers world wide. That's less than a quarter of the circulation of _The Sun_ in the UK. That would be a pathetic result for Murdoch.

The result? He'd have revenues of a $100,000,000 a year.

* ""You graffitied the oldest cliff face in history!"" ""You wouldn't answer your phone!""
* Wizards in fairy tales always turn out to be the Doctor.
* ""Look at me I'm a target!""
* The Doctor talking to Rory but not recognizing that it was *Rory* for the longest time. (And the brilliant quirky music that went along with that scene)
* ""She's Amy and she's surrounded by Romans.  I'm not sure history can take it.""
* River finding the things in Amy's room, and her sighface at the Doctor for doing it to her.
* The Doctor in the TARDIS doesn't know, doesn't know...but the Doctor in the Pandorica, now he knows.  There is a doctor in the TARDIS now, and SHE doesn't know, either.
* River can't die because of Silence in the Library...but then, we were told in that very episode, for the first time, that time can be rewritten.  So I'm a little afraid for her.
* The fact is that the date the TARDIS explodes is still Rory and Amy's wedding date.  I always thought that meant it would have more to do with Amy and Rory.  I'm not sure anymore.  Or was it?

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"OK I'll try and explain it as simply as I can, it's complex because there are so many ways you can get paid, not just from sales, but from TV, film, the internet, licensing, video games etc. etc. 

All collected PRS money goes to an artist through their publishing company who collect it and take a cut ( you can try and collect it yourself, but unless you know what you're doing it's not easy, this is why publishing companies exist to collect your money from around the world ) 

Also, as a record label owner I have to ( by law ) pay a certain percentage of sales to my artists in the form of a mechanical royalty ( I also pay them normal royalties from sales ) this exist so the artist can't get completely ripped off by me if I fuck them about with the sales figures ( I don't FTR )  this also goes to PRS. This mechanical side used to be called MCPS ( mechanical copyright protection society )  but the two entities merged. 

So whatever PRS money an artist is getting is a combination of mechanical royalties ( from their label ) and the PRS licence from business ( shops, clubs, pubs etc. etc. ) 

None of this money goes anywhere near the labels ( major or independent )  and the rest of the music business. It all goes to the artists minus a cut for the publisher for collecting it. 

So the OP was kicking off about the PRS license thinking that it went to the Labels, it doesn't at all, it's a safety net for musicians, in an industry prone to sharks. That's why i got pissed with him/her.

It's a little more complex than that and there is PPL too, but that's briefly what happens.

I studied PRS as part of my degree, and here's my two cents:

1. Yes, they are a diabolical company who want your money because you're playing music by artists on their register.
2. Yes, they are going about it in a heinous and stupid manner, like big burly debt collectors rather than operating a more friendly strategy such as 3 strikes or kindly explaining the reasons behind needing the license.
3. They are completely justified in what they are doing and I support them, in principle. I would like them to conduct business in a 'kinder' fashion.

Why do I support them? Because they are right. You would not like your product to be used by other people without you getting what you deserve from it. Music, to these artists, is their product and their livelihood, now if every Tom, Dick and Harry just played it without giving anything in return, what do the musicians get? Squat. Fuck all. Nothing.

So by paying a license fee to PRS they distribute this music to the musicians depending on how often their music is aired. This is a fair idea and gives the musicians what they deserve for providing you with their product. It is an understandable and perfectly fine way of doing things, you pay a license fee, you get your music, the musicians get their money. Everyone's happy.

**'But they make it up in album sales and gigs and stuff!'** Album sales, not so much anymore. The industry is fucked, put it that way, and that's what has spurred PRS to take this route. The only way artists get any real money today is through touring and merch. Which, even then, doesn't generate much.

Let's look into a hypothetical situation.

Band X sends Label X their demo, and get signed. The label gives them, I dunno, £10,000 to record their debut album. The band hire a quality studio and producer for a few weeks, totalling up about £2,000. They also decided to get shiny new guitars and drums and all that, racking up a nice £5,000. That's £7,000 gone already, then they have to master, print, distribute etc. This might be handled in house by the label, but will most likely be taken from their advance. They've also had to live off that money (if they didn't have any other jobs). Bam! £10,000 gone.

Then the CD is released for £10. Lets say 50% goes to the shop. £5 left, 50% of that goes to the label, £2.50 left, lets say the band gets the rest (£2.50 to the band? fat fucking chance!), but the producer wants his cut, so the band are left with a hypothetical £1 per album release. In reality it will be a LOT lower than this. Split that between the four members, that's 25p each (if they all say they wrote the songs together etc rather than have one sole writer, he'll get a bigger cut if that happens).

The album sells 1000 copies, meaning the band have made 1000 x 0.25 = £250 between them. That's nowt.

If the album has been on the radio, maybe the lead single, then they would want their hard earned cash from that! This is where PRS comes in. They charge even the BBC (as far as I know) for royalties and then dish this out to the artists. This is a **good** tool for the artists.

But if you don't pay this license they get nothing, you get your free music. Not very fair is it?

Its the same as a TV license in a way, because you pay for your TV, you get your TV. So what's the big hoo-ha really about? Its about PRS' business tactics.

They believe that badgering and pestering is how to get you to give them the money, that's fucking bullshit. What they should do is explain how it benefits musicians - because it does, there is little disputing that! But yes, they treat people unfairly and act in a shit manner, so I support you on that one.

I don't know what the overall conclusion of my post is, I think its just generally to say that, in theory, PRS are doing the right thing, but I also support your views on it because they're doing the right thing the wrong way.",0,1276987415,null,0,false,0,c0sh0ki,t3_cgt70,t1_c0sh0ki,t3_cgt70,null,1426349101,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,not_nathan,rory,Rory,"A lot of loose ends were tied up, but some remain dangling, and some new ones were added. Some of the questions I expect to see answered in the conclusion (spoilers unblanked):

* What was Jacket Doctor up to in Flesh and Stone? If he's locked in the Pandorica, and the Tardis explodes, how can he get out and travel through time?
* Who was the shadow in Amy's House near the beginning of The Eleventh Hour? Just Prisoner Zero? I doubt it, as Prisoner Zero wouldn't have had time to make a psychic link with any comatose people and wouldn't need to be disguised at that moment.
* What *is* the deal with Amy's house? The Doctor implied he was curious about it, but they didn't have time to come back to it.
* Building off of that, what was at Amy's house before River? It must have been pretty bad to leave all those burn marks and symbols.
* Was it the same thing that took control of the TARDIS? And spoke through the speaker-grill?
* Why could The Doctor see The Dream Lord after he woke up? Was it just his imagination, or something more?
* Obviously, how are the characters going to get out of this one?
* Why doesn't the duck pond have any ducks?!

Theories on the above: Amy's Choice dropped a few of hints about Omega, The Valeyard, The Black Guardian, and The Celestial Toymaker. Even though The Dream Lord turned out not to be any of them, it does go to show that they're on the Writing Staff's mind at the moment. Any of those characters would be powerful enough to take over the TARDIS, espeically those of them that are Guardians. However, we also got to see the potential darkness of The Doctor's psyche; perhaps thousands of years locked in a box will drive him mad. At that point, though, I feel that the distinctions between The Dream Lord, The Valeyard, and The Doctor are kind of moot, so I will refer to this character as The Valeyard.

Now some people have already found [this highly spoilerrific image](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/File:AmeliaAndThePandorica.PNG), so we know that [The Pandorica opens again, possibly releasing The Doctor, who is now The Valeyard](/spoiler) The Valeyard, now being an [Omnicidal Maniac](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac) may have put this Alliance idea into the heads of the various enemies of The Doctor, and engineered Amy's companionship (it did seem pretty convenient, The Girl in the Fireplace more or less happening again). If the Valeyard really wanted to prevent The Doctor from saving the universe, maybe that was what was behind his attempt to steal The Doctor's regenerations in The Ultimate Foe, not living longer.

So that's all well and good: The Valeyard's back we're doomed. How does it get fixed? Well, a lot has been made this season of Amy's memories.

* Prisoner Zero used them in its final gambit in The Eleventh hour, and had them used against it in turn. 
* She had some of them erased in The Beast Below. 
* She didn't remember The Dalek Invasions in The Victory of The Daleks.
* Her memory of the image of an Angel was turned against her in The Time of Angels, and she was implored to remember something critical in Flesh and Stone.
* Had the Saturnynians succeeded in their designs in Vampires of Venice, her humanity would have been a distant memory.
* Her memories were part of the worlds constructed by The Dream Lord in Amy's Choice.
* She made a valiant effort to preserve her memories in Cold Blood.
* The Alliance used a snapshot of her memories in The Pandorica Opens to trap The Doctor.

I think Amy's memories are a gigantic Chekov's Gun that are going to be used to save the universe in The Big Bang. She'll use her idealized memories of The Doctor from childhood to bring him back so that he can defeat The Valeyard and prevent The Big Bang. This will likely involves some impressive Timey Wimey Flim Flam.

Massive conjecture aside: this episode was brilliant. It turned some of the duller episodes of Series Fnarg into [Midnights on the Firing Lines](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidnightOnTheFiringLine), except for The Lodger, which I bet will be picked up on in a later season. I especially loved how Rory's death wasn't simply undone, how this gave a palpable sense of threat to a lot of Doctor Who's decayed villains (especially the Cybus Cybermen), and how we have just enough foreshadowing for a major game change to happen in the second act of The Big Bang without it feeling like a major ass pull. Also: The Autons appeared and didn't impersonate shop window dummies! Hurrah for novel Autons! I'm seriously hoping that Rory somehow comes out of this alright. It seems mean to jerk us around so much and then not give us a happy ending. But will Auton Rory remember his humanity and live out a normal life like Bracewell, or will the almost assuredly Timey Wimey denouement prevent his death from ever occurring?

tl ; dr - Holy crap wall of text! I'm predicting that The Valeyard tricked The Doctor's enemies into trapping him so that he could destroy The Universe, and Amy's idealized memory of The Doctor will allow him to return and save the day.

In the Lodger, wasn't someone trying to ""build a TARDIS""? And it existed as an entire second floor on a single story building?

I keep thinking back to what the Doctor said to Amy in this episode, about her house being too big or having too many rooms or something. And in The Eleventh Hour, Prisoner Zero was hiding in a room hidden by a perception filter... did Prisoner Zero have the capability to create a perception filter, or was it just taking advantage of what was already there?

Maybe whoever was controlling the TARDIS is the same person who was trying to build their own TARDIS?

Not true.  The artists still get paid because the radio station you're listening too has already paid a huge chunk of money over to the PRS for broadcast rights.  Or at least the PRS gets paid.  We don't know if any of their artists ever get paid because the repeatedly refuse to lists the artists that they represent.  For all we know, they don't actually represent any artists. 

The PRS is an extortion racket.

true,jmk4422,silence,Silence,"I'm thinking that after the TARDIS explodes, ending the universe, somehow the Doctor gains the ability to travel through time via the cracks. Most of the final episode is going to be him doing just that: traveling back to earlier episodes of this season to try and jog Amy's memory.

So what does he tell her? Just a guess but all the same the rest of this post will be spoiler friendly. 

[I think he tells Amy *his true name*. My reasons for this:](/spoiler)

[1.) I think Amy is River Song.](/spoiler)

[2.) In ""Forest of the Dead"" (first appearance of River) he tells her right before she dies, ""But you know my name. There's only one reason I would have told you that, one way that I could have."" That ""one way"", it will turn out, is that if his very life depended on it he could reveal it to someone else. Knowing his True Name will change her a great deal for some reason. Maybe for Time Lords knowing another's True Name is a very intimate, powerful thing, so powerful and intimate that the only scenario the Doctor can imagine doing so would be if the very universe was at stake.](/spoiler)

[3.) In ""Amy's Choice"" this season the Dreamlord, who we find out at the end *is* the Doctor, asks Amy if she really believes that she's the only person in all of the universe whom the Doctor really trusts. She answers with an unequivocal **yes**. He replies, ""Then what's his *name*?""](/spoiler)

[4.) Ever since Amy forgot about Rory the Doctor has sort of been trying to get her to remember him... especially in this episode. Why? Because like he said in this episode, if someone can remember something forgotten, it can come back.](/spoiler)

[5.) Moffat wrote ""Forest of the Dead"" and he's now the head-writer for the series. He wrote tonight's episode and next week's episode.](/spoiler)

[So my theory is that the Doctor will slip through the cracks, revisiting Amy in earlier episodes this season. First as a little girl to tell her his True Name. Then in ""The Beast Below"" right before she wipes her memory after viewing the truth about the United Kingdom ship (e.g. she'll be shocked to see him there, I mean where did he come from? But he'll just say, ""Look, you're about to forget the last twenty minutes anyway, so don't worry about why I'm here. Now listen, this is important: do you remember what I told you when you were seven?"" After that he'll visit her in ""Flesh and Stone"" (i.e. the famous jacket-doctor scene... he visits her there because it won't fuck up the time line because she can't see him since her eyes are closed and the clerics there are looking outward so they don't see him appear, either.](/spoiler)

[After that, who knows? Maybe some clever writing has him showing up with her again in other episodes, too. Like in ""The Lodger"" he might have spoke to her via headset. ""In Vincent and the Doctor"" maybe there's a whole scene that happened that we'll see for the first time, something where Amy is alone with the ""jacket Doctor"" but doesn't hurt the time line.](/spoiler)

[Point is, when Amy *does* finally remember his True Name, he'll come back from having been erased. He'll essentially be a Doctor outside the TARDIS (remember that the Weeping Angels and Prisoner Zero both referred to him as the ""Doctor in the TARDIS""). At that point he'll figure some shit out (I'm personally hoping it will involve that guy from ""The Lodger""... he did give the Doctor his keys, after all, and it'd be nice to see that episode, which I loved, tie into the finale... maybe it'll involve the Doctor taking the time-ship from that episode to do some badass shit, I don't know).](/spoiler)

[This is all speculation of course. Just guesses. I'm going to love re-reading this post after I watch next Saturday's episode. I'll either feel like a genius, a moron, or something in-between.)](/spoiler)",0,1277016974,null,0,true,0,c0shtlx,t3_cgt5q,t1_c0shtlx,t1_c0shaqt,null,1426349477,10,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,10

I have to say I much prefer 'season 32' over 'season 5'. As I said, this show is all about its heritage, so I would be looking to emphasize this in the numbering. There is no doubt in the content of the show that it is continuous from the preceding series and Doctors, now more than ever.

Wikipedia also quotes a translation of Hesiod which calls it 'hope:'

Only Hope remained there in an unbreakable home within under the rim of the great jar, and did not fly out at the door; for ere that, the lid of the jar stopped her, by the will of Aegis-holding Zeus who gathers the clouds. [100] But the rest, countless plagues, wander amongst men; for earth is full of evils, and the sea is full. Of themselves diseases come upon men continually by day and by night, bringing mischief to mortals silently; for wise Zeus took away speech from them.""

So we have the Daleks trying to prevent what they wanted in the first place, we have the cyber men who have 0 1 (binary logic) meaning they see you as a weak race that needs to be exterminated or if you are a strong race, assimilated. So why would they be working with other species? Why would they even care about the universe being destroyed? 

Writing them selves out of this one: Honestly, writing this kind of dramatic problem is not one you can get out of easily. They can only go two ways with this one.

**IT WAS ALL A DREAM!** So one obvious way is to say it was all a dream and that it never happened

**TIME CHANGED, NEVER HAPPENED** Doctor some how fixes things, time reverts. 

So in effect, this will never have happened. 

Another thing, the Doctor not realizing that Rory is there. Right, it is not an over used and stupid cliche. Sorry but this kind of writing is annoying. 

I am sorry, this is not Science Fiction. It is fiction. You see, shows like Star Trek at least have *some* basis on science. It is mostly theory but still, it *could* work in some cases. Sure, there were tons of Deus ex machinas namely solving such and such with this particle and that field of this and well, you get the idea. Still, the entire premise could, how ever unlikely, happen.  Doctor who uses Deus ex machinas a lot in the past but they were just plain bull shit. Think back on the episode, Journey's End. They blew up every Dalek with some non nonsensical shit and with a few button presses. Thankfully, this new doctor has more to do with characters than technology... Wait a minute, character depth. So Rory dies, is this supposed to make me feel an emotional response? Really? Rory didn't have much character beyond bumbling around and some how fighting a fish vampire with a broom. Every companion had character. **Rose**: ""Moral compass"", taught the Doctor many things about humanity **Martha**:  Could figure out the problems and generally kick ass **Dona**: A true friend to the Doctor, spunky and fun. Even Amy has some character in her, she is young and very energetic. She even talks crap to lizards who were about to do some crazy stuff to her. Now we have Rory, no character. He is essentially a [Red Shirt](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt). With minimal investment as a character, we are then expected to care when he dies. Right. So clearly, I do not like this new series. I am sorry but this series has gone on too long. Its all bull shit. Think about it, if the Daleks just shot him instead of listening to him, he would have been dead 4 seasons ago. Honestly, the writers can't think of any thing new so they bring back his greatest enemies and instead of killing him, they put him in a box. ???

What if the cloister bell that caused The Doctor to go running back to the TARDIS before he disappeared for 12 years wasn't actually coming from *his* TARDIS (or, at least, the one out in the yard) but rather it was from the one right up the staircase?  If you watch carefully, when little Amy runs back to pack her bag the light has disappeared.

I wonder if the cloister bell was maybe from the impending explosion of the TARDIS River was in?  We know she was around Amy's house 14 years later and Amy seems to be the epicenter of something.  The light seems bright...kind of like the light from the cracks.  Maybe the cloister bell was coming through a crack?  And what if The Doctor really didn't lie and didn't make a mistake, what if whatever was around Amy's house was what caused him to be 12 years late (""the engines were phasing"")?  And then to similarly skip forward another 2 years, making it ""14 years since fish custard""?  We've seen in the past that the TARDIS reacts to certain things in different ways.

Fury from the deep - The second doctor first uses the sonci screwdriver (it resembles a small pen torch), 

Spearhead from space - The third doctor produces a new sonic crewdriver, it resembles a pen with a tiny radar dish on top (it's kind of hard to describe properly)

Frontier in space - the third doctor wires his screwdriver to a door on the moon and leaves it behind, in the next episode he has another almost identical one, no mention is made of where he got it.
The sonic screwdriver doesn't change much of the next several years

Destiny of the Daleks - Romana now has her own sonic scredriver which is a very similar design to the doctors

The visitation - A tereptril catches the fifth doctor with his screwdriver and blows it up, he doesn't get a replacement

Lungbarrow (book) The seventh doctor meets romana on gallifrey, she give him her screwdriver and sends him off on a mission whiche leads us to

The TV movie, - the seventh doctor gets killed and the eight doctor keeps using the screwdriver

Father time (book) - the eighth doctor is trapped in the eighties with most of his memory gone, by now he's lost his screwdriver so he builds a device he calls ""a sonic suitcase""

at some point after this he gets the blue light sonic screwdriver we se the ninth doctor with in Rose

Smith and jones - the tenth doctor melts his screwdriver by using it to supercharge an xray machine. By the next episode he has another one of identical design, it's not mentioned where he got it

The eleventh hour - after the tenth doctors explosive regeneration, the blue light sonic is erratic and melts half way through the episode. At the end of the episode a new green light sonic pops out of the tardis console.

There is also evidence to suggest that our very idea of consciousness arises through seemingly random 'mistakes' in our brain and that, without this fundamentally random element, our pattern-based brain would be nothing but a hunk of meat.

Memories are simply not subjective, they are recordings of your own personal perspective, not just what you have experienced but also how you have experienced it.

One of my clients is actually involved in this sort of research on animals. It mainly involves producing synthetic stimuli and certain operations on the brain itself and monitoring the physical and behavioural changes.

Consciousness, self-awareness and so on are purely subjective ideas that cannot be tested, and are probably illusory. What we can see is how 'patterns' are formed (which is an extrapolation of synapse/neuron changes, I guess), how they change and how this affects behaviour.

How is it that Prisoner Zero knew that the silence was coming after the Pandorica opened when the Atraxi and the rest of the Alliance didn't know that it would only occur after the Pandorica opened? They figured that the Pandorica would stop the silence. There's something going on here, but it might just be that the Alliance was blinded by whoever is controlling them.

Prisoner Zero's time of origin comes subjectively after the Pandorica and the Silence.  I don't think that's our villain, but I do think that Prisoner Zero *worked for* our real villain.

There are a some things that could be called hard scifi, but they are rarely very popular.

Hard scifi doesn't exist, largely, because it's damn hard to write and tends to be a bit technical by nature.  Because of this, it usually ends up being a poor story and having poor reception.  Some people can do it, but it's much easier and more exciting to just do whatever, within some reason.  As Arthur C. Clarke said, ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"", this makes it possible to hand wave over this stuff without suspending disbelief in most stories.  There's no reason why it couldn't be true, given sufficient knowledge and energy.  However, that doesn't make it actually possible by what we know about the world.  Usually, a scifi that is looking to make itself more realistic and sufficiently advances, takes ideas on the fringes of science and interprets that as where the future is, making technology that becomes nonsense to the ears of people who have actual training in this sort of thing.

My point bringing up Apollo 13, is that space is really hard to depict because of gravity. Wire-work and tanks aren't that realistic. Apollo 13 was able to do so because a) Apollo was really small (no long sequences needed) and b) they had the budget of a major movie.

So once we start to have space in a story, it gets expensive to turn into a show. Artificial gravity devices (other than spinning) tends to lead to inertial compensators and next we are talking warp fields and whatever.

&gt;Hard scifi doesn't exist, largely, because it's damn hard to write and tends to be a bit technical by nature.

Not just that, most of the time - nothing obvious happens. If you take one of the most impressive bits of science happening at the moment, the LHC - you build it, you run it (lots of flashing lights) and then you analyse the results. Hardly good story material for TV even if they discover Higgs/ToE or whatever.

Take a story based on the LHC, say Flashforward. The book was ok but was heavily dumbed down to become a series. The main story moved from being scientists at CERN to the FBI agents (no doubt because they are easier for the audience to identify with). The end result was something that wasn't completely satisfactory to either a technical audience or the general public.

A major problem is the way that TV is made. If you make something primarily for a single market (as US shows are mostly made) and it only appeals to 2% of viewers, it is dead. ",0,1277117719,null,0,false,0,c0skcmh,t3_cgt1i,t1_c0skcmh,t1_c0sk73s,null,1426350672,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I sort of see your point concerning the Rassilon/Master thing, but there is a *very* important difference: In the End of Time, the Master was the antagonist. The Rassilon connection could easily be ignored without a loss of comprehension on the part of the audience as far as character is concerned. However, in this case, the alliance is what has been purported as the villain(s); they may have a motivation that we have not yet seen (i.e. they are actually unwilling pawns in someone else's plan, etc.), but as of yet there is no reason to think that Omega is any better than a completely new character/ twist/ what-have-you.  

I guess what I was driving at was that, at least in the context of the current series, springing Omega out of the anti-matter universe would encourage lots of explaining and voice-overs and flashbacks, etc. That can be OK, but it is a safer bet (from a production standpoint) to have lots of things *happen* in the series finale. No one wants to watch people sit around and explain things to each other when [the Doctor is locked-up, the TARDIS has just seemingly exploded with River inside it, and nestene-Rory just shot Amy Pond](/spoiler).  

Last word: all of that having been said, I, personally, hope that Omega does show up. If not this week, then maybe some other season. It seems to me that Moffat has probably thought that some fans will be expecting Omega in the finale, and would be very much in the vein of his style to avoid it for that very reason. At any rate, we'll find out in a few days!

I seriously doubt Prisoner Zero is the Doctor. The Atraxi just leave when they get the multiform. The only thing I found a bit off was they came back when the Doctor did (12 years). I attributed this to the fact they had no idea where the crack led and it being closed somewhat ruined any option for them to pop through and have a look. My guess is they followed a signal from the psychic paper they apparently have the ability to communicate with.

I don't think the Atraxi would just fuck off if they found the prisoner they were looking for when they were previously demanding his surrender. Especially since they captured the multiform with little to no effort after they found it. 

The voice of the repeated warning message ""Prisoner zero will vacate..."" is the same as the Atraxi Eyeball ship thing when the Doctor talks to it on the hospital roof. Unless this guys recording messages for everything the Atraxi have ever been involved in I kinda doubt it is a message from the Pandorica.

On another note: Do all the races shown in the Alliance have time travel capabilities? It bothered me they all showed up together. I accept the Daleks, they know whats up in the time department but the rest should be out of the loop. The cybermen shouldn't even exist at that point in time. So did they all hop through respective cracks because so many lead to this point in time? Did the Daleks hand out some one time use time traveling devices? Did the Daleks (the only ones we can be positive traveled through time to get to Stonehenge, along with Cybermen since they wouldn't exist at that time-I think) just bop around recruiting the races from that period in time? Speaking on the Alliance, I wonder who started it. With the threat of them all never existing I can accept that they WOULD work together but I'd love to see an entire episode just based on them all having a chat and being diplomatic.

In my original comment I was merely stating the origins of the hunt. 

My opinion of hunt saboteurs being classist comes from where I grew up ( A village in Co Durham, called Kirk Merrington, near Darlington, home of the Zetland Hunt ) I liked the hunt, it was a colourful addition to the village. Now when all the anti-hunting rhetoric kicked up in the 80's and it became the hunt verses the activist there was an incident where a saboteur staked a hedge, the huntsman hit the hedge was thrown and broke his leg, the horse became lame and therefore shot. 

Now in light of this incident, to me it became apparent that this was obviously not about the fox, because why hurt a human and kill a horse if you care about animals so much, it was about class, the haves against the have nots.

Perhaps it was as I mention and sheer bad luck, did you ever consider that? Or a really misplaced and inexperienced sabber or didn't know better.

Disrupting the hunt is the target, not injuring a horse or human, I can't get that across to you enough. You'll not find any sabber I've ever encountered stake a hedge for the sole reason to fucking a horse up so the rider comes off. If it were about that sort of stuff then we'd be simply barging people off horses all over the place and snaring hedges at the top.

I can see a reason you might have come to that reasoning but I find it a little bigoted. I've had racial abuse from Pakistanis, but it doesn't mean I think they're all dickhead racists. That's just silly.

Five feet away from him was a Whipper-in who refused to use his gun, even though I asked him to because it was the decent thing to do because this idiot couldn't actually drown the Stag, instead he was making the poor thing suffer for nothing other than his own inability.

A few of them have done that already, and it didn't work as well as they had hoped. Even if they know about the regeneration limit, they may consider ""alive, locked in a box"" to be a safer option. After all, the Master has managed a few more regenerations than the traditional limit.


&gt; The Doctor's worst enemies come together and all they can do is lock him in a box? 

He has eaten recently. He's securely locked in a chair, and can't take his trousers off. He's going to be there til he starves to death often enough that he can't keep regenerating.

They've done something much worse than just ""lock him in a box"".  :)

The idea that there was rampant ""health tourism"" was shown to be over-hyped two years ago.  The research is all there to be read, should you have any inclination to check it out, if anything foreign born residents are unaware of what they could be getting from the NHS, rather than coming here to abuse it.  People who are legally resident here get access to the health care they're entitled to, but if you're not legally resident, unless you happen to have a life threatening condition, it's hard to get treated here on the NHS without paying.

This is it, I think. My husband and I get a big kick out of River &amp; the Doctor's scenes together, because we bicker the same way. When my husband makes a mess in the kitchen I'm known to sigh ""Why do I let you in here?""

&gt;So will we find out who Dr. Song killed and why she was in jail?

My theory is: young Amelia pesters her Aunt to take her to see the Pandorica at a museum. Pandora's Box was her favorite fairytale, so if she read about an artifact called the Pandorica, she would want to see it. Somehow, she'll open it -- either by remembering something the Doctor told her, by wishing, *something* -- and he will travel across his and Amy's own timelines via the cracks to engineer a way to stop the TARDIS from exploding.

Because he has crossed his own timeline, we effectively end up with two Doctors. One is the Doctor in the TARDIS, the one whose adventures we have followed this season, a Doctor who doesn't know what's going on; the other is the Doctor sprung from the Pandorica, without a TARDIS, and he *does* know what's going on...and as he told Amy in ""Flesh and Stone,"" he's working it out.

Either PZ is involved, or introducing the crack was what mattered and that meant *something* had to be on the other side but the specific something isn't relevant.

Fixing some of the contradictions? I mean, the *Seventh* Doctor was 953 years old when he **began**. How did the Ninth Doctor become 900?

And really, how **did** we get from Eighth to Ninth Doctor?

An explanation as to where the old-school Cybermen went; and how they might have reacted to the existence of the new Cybermen; especially if the new ones were around in Victorian times?

Edit: and if we're going to create ""awesome"" spinoff characters like the Doctor's Daughter or super-Donna, how about *using* them?

And a couple of ""hard"" science-fiction episodes, please; where the consequences in the episode arise from complications in the science, rather than ""if you wish hard enough and kiss the girl, you can defeat the alien technology!"". You know: seeing as ""Doctor Who"" is/was meant to be a *science-fiction* show...?

And a bit of consistency-proofing in the current writing: if the Doctor can remember Rory because he's time-capable, why exactly does Amy forget? And worse, why does Amy's house, which is **not** a time traveller, hold memories the Nestene/Autons could siphon for a rebuild when Rory supposedly no longer exists?

(Edit-edit: so, Davros can plan to destroy the entire universe and that's okay; but when the Doctor *supposedly* causes the destruction of the universe, the Daleks *and Sontarans* **and Cybermen** ***all band together to stop him?***)

How about a view of how the *first* Smith/Gillan episode (or the Venice episode) worked out, *now that Rory no longer exists*?

A couple of spin-off episodes that don't so much require Matt Smith and Karen Gillan; how about (as mentioned above) a primarily non-Doctor/Amy episode? Like the LINDA thing? *How about a couple of Time War retrospectives*?

How about some of the backstory as to how this Pandorica alliance got off the ground and didn't end up in massive territorial wars between some of the most dangerous, territorial and militarised non-human species in the universe?

Or, seeing as the Time War was the most cataclysmic thing (that didn't involve a season-ender, that is) that could've happened, how about a few ""oh no, here's a consequence of the Time War"" dangers?

My Pet Theory: the ""Sonic"" screwdriver is not a ""sonic"" technology, similar for Jack's Sonic gun. How about ""Sonic"" being a **brand name** and we get to see the Sonic Factory?

Reference to a Time Agent in the last episode. How about seeing the Time Agency?

Could you **please** stop destroying the universe every year? If I wanted that, I'd start reading more DC comics.

Oh, easy. He spent a year without any assistants. That could be a hundred years of travelling(*). Tennant already met Davison. Not hard at all to include a back-continuity Smith meets Tennant episode.

Or: a bunch of novels where one Doctor leaves a ""holographic"" message for another.

There *was* a nice Virgin novel where the Seventh Doctor travels through his own mind and the various Doctors have taken up residence in various sectors of the ""mental cyberscape"" (last of the novels to deal with the TimeWyrm, IIRC).

That's *before* we get into the whole Parallel Universe nonsense again.

Edit: Davies gave us the ""oh, I'm not just a Time Lord"" (imply: no 12 regeneration rule?) and the regrowing hand stunt. Some ""temporary reversion thanks to the TARDIS's Discombobulation Defropuliser"" is all it takes. :-(

Then why not tell him this as they lock him in. There's nothing to be gained by lying to him. Also, your comments about not all the aliens being enemies is irrelevant. Why should the alliance consist only of enemies, why not other races that had no reason to hate the Doctor?

And you've forgotten something.

We never saw what happened here, or who was in the Tardis (the Doctor or River), bit it did return on that first day.

What they actually set out that day to do was push a child in front of a car on the busy dual carriage way nearby. They decided (which shows an amount of thinking and intent) not to do that and changed there minds. Instead they kidnapped a child from a busy market (again showing intent to carry out a crime) - They then took him to nearby train yard and tortured Bulger over a period of hours and did things like force him to eat batteries, hit him around the head with bricks, poured paint down his throat and when he finally died they mutilated his body (like cutting his penis off etc yeah these are things not widely exposed in the news to try and save his family some pain) and then they dumped his body on a train line and covered it up with bits of stuff in the hope that a train (which did) would come and cut him up and it would look like an accident. Those sorts of things are not so well thought out by kids that *get carried away* - They are purposeful and intended and furthermore admitted. That's the thing, they showed no remorse at all, Venables sat smiling in the dock for most of it. When you saw him in the flesh the media were not wrong for demonising him, he was cocky, belligerent, full of nothing but malice and without sounding like a tool, evil.

It's for those reasons that I feel even letting them (him especially) out so early was a mistake, even more so with the protection of the law under new names. I agree that this country spends way too much time criminalising its youth, but these two *were* criminals who had intentionally commited a disgusting crime and that's the simple fact that apologists for them so easily forget.

I agree, he needs to be now held at HM's pleasure in a secure facility of some kind. He's proved that he can't be out and about.

*shrugs* - I agree, if he is guilty it's strike three time in my book.

I've often also wondered about the fairness of his anonymity on others he has met during his time out. For instance, imagine if you were in a relationship with him, or had a child by him and you found out who he *really* was - how do you think that might feel? Then of course there is the theory of you're never more than six people away etc. It's a proper quandary when you start thinking of the wider impacts and its affects on the public.

As someone with a great many friends studying degrees containing English and Sociology at a reputable University (York), I take great issue with this.

The number of contact hours students receive per week doesn't in any way reflect upon the quantity of work required.

I'm studying Philosophy, Politics and Economics, and I've ended up spending what seems like every waking moment either reading around the material, making notes, or writing essays.

There's a depressing tendency to label Arts subjects as somewhat less challenging than, say, a hard science- which I'd contend is a crock of shite.
A different sort of subject, certainly- but by no means ""lesser"".

It's *entirely* possible to waste your time at University doing an Arts degree, certainly- yet those that do so will simply not come out with a degree of anything near the quality, or classification, of those who put in the work that's genuinely required. By no means are we all in it to spend three years on the lash.

true,[deleted],null,null,"""Well, you see, honey... In The Brain of Morbius, Morbius  was a renegade Time Lord from the Doctor's birthplace, Gallifrey. He had been a member of the High Council of Time Lords, and attempted to move the Time Lords' policy towards the rest of the universe from observation to conquest. When the Time Lords rejected him, he formed an army of his own. He promised his followers the secrets of time travel and immortality. Morbius was eventually defeated and executed by his fellow Time Lords for his crimes. However, his brain survived. The remaining organ was taken away by the fanatical scientist Solon, who was planning the resurrection of Morbius.

The Fourth Doctor and Sarah found Morbius in Solon's castle on the planet Karn. Solon had built a freakish Frankenstein's monster body from parts of crashed space travellers (including the arm of Solon's assistant Condo) and planned to place Morbius's brain in it. Solon drugged the Doctor, intending to use his head for Morbius's brain, but insisted that it would be ""no crude butchery.""

Sarah foiled Solon's original plan, but he had an alternative container for Morbius' brain — a large glass bowl with two eyestalks. Although he disapproved of using this, claiming it suffered from buildups of static electricity, Morbius insisted. Solon attached this to the patchwork body, and this time round, the plan worked. However, during the operation, Morbius' brain was knocked to the floor when Condo went into a fury at seeing his missing arm attached to the body, apparently causing Morbius further brain damage.

The ghoulishly resurrected Morbius fought the Doctor in a series of violent encounters. Their final confrontation was a dangerous Time Lord mental contest called ""mind-bending"". Although Morbius nearly won the confrontation, sending the Doctor into a coma, the strain caused his artificial braincase to overload, burning out his brain and leaving his body a berserk monster. The Sisterhood of Karn, longtime opponents of Morbius, chased the monster to a clifftop, from which he fell, apparently fatally. The Sisterhood then used the Elixir of Life (a substance of which they were guardians) to revive the Doctor.

Morbius's war against the Time Lords and his execution (including how Solon saved his brain and the Fifth Doctor's involvement in his defeat) are depicted in the Past Doctor Adventures novel Warmonger by Terrance Dicks. In 2008, Big Finish Productions resurrected Morbius for the Eighth Doctor stories Sisters of the Flame and Vengeance of Morbius.

Your point does stand, insofar as the New labour government came into power looking at a deficit, one of Tory making and policies that were almost as bad as the budget just delivered. May I point out I am no fan whatsoever of New Labour, Blair nor Brown or Darling. 

So many mistakes were taken by New Labour over the 13 years they were in power is astounding! Yet I must say they carried forward watered-down Thatcherite policies. 

Where I do agree with the Brown Chancellorship is that the country needed massive investment ... that only the government could do ... they 'spent' it in the wrong areas after 3 years. We may be arguing semantics, but the budget just delivered is a cross your fingers budget. And I must admit I am on the pessimistic side.

I'll try and answer all the questions;

* Our current shirt sponsorship deal is with a local college, and I can't imagine it is worth a huge amount. We have recently signed another deal with a local tyre/exhaust company to sponsor our shorts next season. I have seen other clubs in our league with 3 or 4 sponsors, I'm sure we could fit a 'Reddit Alien' in somewhere on the shirt. 

* I have never used 'Reddit' before and found out through a post from one of your members on our supporters forum;
http://rufc.forumup.co.uk/

* If you register to the supporters forum, you can contact the guy who runs the supporters club regarding shirts. He goes under the alias of (+)-(+) and his real name is Dave! I think they are around £35 and made by a company called Errea.

* There are various chants that can be heard at the Valley, alot of them have been introduced recently through a group of supporters that put there heads together at the end of last season to try and improve the atmosphere and match day experience. The main one is to the tune of 'Country Roads';

    Take me home, Cedar Road, 
    To the place, I belong 
    To Redditch United, where the Reds play 
    Take me home, Cedar Road 
    repeat

(Ceder Road is the main terrace where most of the fans stand at home games) 
If you have a dig around on the forum during March and April you will find lots more!

* Regarding favourite current players, that is a tough one as we lost almost all our squad at the end of last season! From last season Danny Lewis and Asa Charlton were probably the most consistant. Danny is an excellent young goalkeeper, who is actually from Redditch. He followed our old manager to Kidderminster Harriers in the summer to go full time and play at a higher level. Asa was our captain last year and signed for Corby Town who are in our league, they are probably paying him a bit more money! 

* Norman Sylla is without doubt the best player we have had in recent history. He scored lots of goals for us during the 2004/05 season and nearly fired us into a play off place! He has piled his trade across Europe since then and represeted Senegal at international level in 2007. Birmingham City defender Scott Dann played for us during the 2005/06 season. Andy Ducros who played half of last season for us last year once played a hand full of Premiership games for Coventry. Exodus Geohaghon played for us as recently as 2008, finished last season in the Championship with Peterborough United. 

* I followed Aston Villa for years, although became very disillusioned with Premiership football and gain a huge amount more enjoyment in following Redditch.

* Champions League?! Not in my life time!!!!!!

im in a house hold of 3 all earning something taking no benefits and not earning near 40K and we have everything we need but then we don't spend out benefits on 3L of white lighting and 20 fags a day

the poorest with kids are getting help, pensioners are getting help low payed workers are getting help.

the only ones bitching are the benefit whore who see it as a life style not a safety net.
business is being encouraged and that should bring in additional jobs meaning less on benefits.

Acquiring big shows like Who or Torchwood requires them to adjust their budget and pick up cheaper programs to fill the rest of their schedule with.

All that being said, it's a shame they can't find a better way to do things. BBCA could be one of the best networks on TV if they had complete access to the BBC catalog. I'd kill to watch QI legally in the States.

**ACT I**

Doctor Who and Capt. Jack are traveling through time in the TARDIS when it picks up a signal from late WWII that indicates the presence of highly advanced technology. When the land they realize they are at a secret German military installation and discover that Nazi Daleks have captured Wernher von Braun and are forcing him to build advanced technology with his team of German scientists.

**ACT II**

The Doctor and Captain Jack defeat the Daleks with some jiggery pokery and leave them defenseless against a scientist uprising. The Daleks realize that their plan has failed and utilize a crude time travel device to escape before they are cut down, and when the dust settles, Captain Jack brings in Torchwood to clean up.

**ACT III**

Torchwood takes the scientists to debrief them in the real story behind Operation Paperclip. Von Braun promises the Doctor he will work to advance humanity to set right the wrongs he was forced to commit with his genius, even if he can never tell the world the truth about his time working for the Germans as a matter of national security. The entire event is covered up and becomes the genesis for all the rumors about German superweapons.

**ACT IV**

When the Russians eventually march through and discover the facility, the few artifacts of the event left behind are enough to scare Stalin into becoming the paranoid mass murderer history remembers. Realizing from the scopes in the TARDIS that they are inextricably woven into the Cold War, The Doctor and Capt. Jack make a brief stop at the 60's White House to give President Kennedy a bit of advice about the WWII era alien technology in some missiles that are being shipped to Cuba to prevent WWIII from happening as a result of the Dalek's interference, and on the way out, there's a gag where we find out Capt. Jack shagged Marilyn Monroe.

It ended up merging with the TARDIS, and to get rid of it the Doctor had to eject a bunch of hardware into the vortex while in flight. The creature survives and assimilates the hardware and grabs the TARDIS with a mechanical claw. The Doctor is busy being useless so Ace shoves him out of the way and uses the chameleon circuit to change the exterior into a smooth sphere, causing the creature to lose its grip. The creature/TARDIS hybrid later becomes the Timewyrm.

true,kindall,null,null,"BASIC uses the same symbol for two different operations (assigning a value to a variable and testing two values for equality). Most other languages use two different symbols for these two operations.

In BASIC you're actually supposed to say LET A = 4 or whatever, but most versions of BASIC let you leave out the LET, so it looks the same.

In Pascal you say ""A := 4"" to set A to 4 and ""if A = 4"" to test the value of A to see if it is 4.

In C and languages that follow its syntax rules (Java, C#, C++, JavaScript, ActionScript, the list goes on) you say ""A = 4"" to set A to 4 and ""if (A == 4)"" to test to see if A is 4. 

If you say ""if (A = 4)"" then, in C at least, the statement is going to *set* A to 4, then test the result (4) to see if it is true, which, since it is nonzero, it is. Probably not what you expected! This is a common C programming error, and leads to people writing such conditions instead as ""if (4 == A)"" to catch these errors at compile time (the computer would complain if you left out an equals sign, since you would be trying to assign to 4 rather than a variable).

Bracewell is 100% robot/android/automaton..whatever.   We know he has a big metal chest with an Oblivion Continuum in it.   No way he could be the big D. 

Interesting side note.. RTD wrote a scene for the Series 4 finale that showed Davros getting in the accident that damaged him in the first place as a flashback.

There's actually a good answer for that. C is designed so that a computer that is interpreting the language does not need to know very much about the context it's in. That is, = always means assignment; it doesn't mean assignment most of the time *but* equality in an if statement. To deal with the same symbol having context-dependent meanings requires the compiler to keep track of what commands it has already seen and it makes it very hard to ensure that a program does not contain errors (and to generate good error messages when it does).

A total lack of BASIC-style ambiguities makes a compiler for the C language much simpler to write than one for a language such as BASIC or FORTRAN, which, at the time C was invented (the '70s) was very important because it allowed the language to run on minicomputers, yet to get good performance.

If the subreddit is for ""anyone interested in Doctor Who"" then somebody could be here having only watched the first five episodes of season one, meaning that we would have to have a spoiler warning for mentioning Daleks in any way that would indicate that they were an enemy, because that would be a spoiler for them.  Come to think of it, even pictures of David Tennant or Matt Smith as the Doctor would be spoilers for those who haven't made it past season 1 yet.

But that's ridiculous.  Nearly every link would be a spoiler, so people not wanting to hear stuff about the newest 2 or three episodes would either be afraid to click ANYTHING on the page or would click stuff and be pissed when they run into one they actually didn't want to see.

We have to have some sort of standard to determine if it should be considered a spoiler or not.  I'd say, anything not in the current season is fair game for anything and everything.

Of course, saying we can't use anything from the current season in the titles wouldn't work.  We couldn't say, well, *anything*.  Nobody would know what links were about.  It'd be a mess.  No duck ponds, no Amy/Amelia, no Pandorica....  Maybe we can't mention (directly in titles) anything learned within the last three weeks or so.  Gives Americans time to watch it on BBC America.  Not sure if anyone's later than that.  *And you mods will have to update the sidebar to remind us which episode is the newest episode we can mention stuff from*.  That way there's no confusion.

If anything after that point is mention *in the post or in the article*, the title should add [spoiler ep10] on it.  (or whatever episode they're discussing)  Then in the discussion, anything mentioning episodes past that point must be [spoiler'd](/spoiler)&lt;--not actually a spoiler.  But anything up to and including that episode is fair game in that discussion.  That way, people can safely avoid episodes they haven't watched yet, while enjoying discussions of ones they have.

Edit: and maybe add a ""theory discussion"" for each new episode where people can discuss their theories freely, without having to spoiler anything.

Having the Doctor meet these two and have an adventure with both of them together would be cool because it could simultaneously explain the philosophical paths each took with their lives, as they interpret their experiences through the lens of their own personality. They would witness the Doctor's seemingly supernatural powers and face terrifying monsters with him, and each would come away with an interpretation of those events that would permanently shape the course of their lives.

Doyle would see it as confirmation of his (possibly latent, at that point) beliefs in spirits, demons and magical powers.

The right given to them by an elected parliament. This really is a stupid question. They did not rob you the government elected by the people gave them the money. 

The government has gained shares they will cash them in when they see fit. You get to vote for someone who wants to do so in 5 years (prolly before that if we are honest) 

You do not want to live in a country where the government just seizes assets when it chooses. Just because you think they should. No one will set up a private company of any form in that enviroment. 

Every corner shop relies on the right to property if a government can seize property from an airline they can do so from the newsagent, local mechanics, newspapers, communications companies. 

I have no issue with nationalisation of certain interests. But the tax payer has to pay for it in exactly the same way I would if I came to your house and said I need your car more then you do.

Creating a government that has the right to seize property without repayment just for the national good will do more harm to our econ then it could ever fix. ",0,1277384591,null,0,false,0,c0ssthq,t3_chpls,t1_c0ssthq,t1_c0ssidi,null,1426354676,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

OUR tax money was not there to bailout any section of the private sector, it was their for public services, which benefit the whole of society, not a financial elite that bankrupted the nation.

'You do not want to live in a country where the government just seizes assets when it chooses' but your OK living in a country where an unelected financial elite can seize the nations wealth, when ever it chooses and then use it to pay multi million pound bonuses to the very people who wrecked our economy, while the very victims of the banks greed suffer mass unemployment, poverty and the gutting of public services. This is 'really stupid'.

Your defence of private property is, to use your words, 'stupid' and hypocritical. If the principles of 'free market' capitalist economics, which are: complete absence of government regulation, subsidies, artificial price pressures and government-granted monopolies, which are applied to the unemployed and poor as much as the beloved small business people you apparently care for so much, why are they not applicable to of all people the banks and financial institutions? 

Why do yo attempt to defend the indefensible, capitalism by its own standards and principles has been proven (time and time again) to be completely discredited and clearly proven not to work. 

You justify the bailout of the banks with billions of pounds of our money and then turn your back on the very victims of their criminal activities i.e. the unemployed and the poor. Who are the real 'spongers'?...clearly the banks!

Are you aware of the that its taken a ruthless and murderous dictatorship in China to implement capitalism or is that your idea of 'doing far better'? Are you aware of the horrendous living and working conditions in China and India? 

'They are doing far better'...who is they? Not the workers. 

'Capitalism isn't essentially bad, its what caused the industrial revolution and what led to the life we have now'

Capitalism was indeed a huge progressive improvement from feudalism but has been for a long time a deep rotten economic system, that results in huge sections of the world (if not the vast majority) living in utter poverty, if not actually starving to death and continuous outbreaks of war.

'We just need to make sure the balance of interests never tips to far towards the businesses and that people don't forget that money is worthless unless its invested in something'

You fail to recognise the indicative nature of capitalism, which is the exploitation of the vast majority for the continued and ever increasing greed of a insignificant minority and who is going to ensure ' the balance of interests never tips to far towards the businesses'? C

In regards to money and commodities that requires a detailed explanation and if I may, I recommend you give 'Capital' a read by Marx.

'As for Stalinism, that ended with the Kruschev reforms back in the 50's' this is one of the most ignorant political and historical statement I have ever heard. I suggest for for an accurate assessment of Stalinism you read 'The Revolution Betrayed' by Leon Trotsky.

true,hp0,cnty-uk,Oxford,"&gt; So what your really saying is that once elected any government can do what the hell it likes and completely ignore the will and wishes of the people

Yes that is basically the structure of the UK constitution. The UK has a non written constitution that is formed and changed at the will of parliament. Once you elect them they get to do as they choose. The only limitation is the fact that they must go back to the people and get re-elected within 5 years. This is suposed to encourage them to take the will of the people into accopunt.

The problem with removing the right to property (as has been tried by a few governments) is that it give even more power to the government then we currently have. Money and property are weapons just like guns and tanks.

In the UK you have the right to leverage your property and use it to remove your dependence on the government. You may not have the ability. But you have the right. 

In a true socialist system you have no right to property. As such your right to housing and food relies directly on the will of society to provide it. In that case society is manifest in the form of the government handing down the rules.

Should that government become corrupt (as it always has in previous attempts to do this) the people as individuals have little or no ability to rebel. To do so removes their right to use the land to survive of as it belongs to the government.

Both systems have floors but history indicates that capitalism is more controlled by the people then socialism.

The main reason we have the level of corruption we have now. Is the lack of attention from the average voter for the last 30+ years. Most voters do not worry or care about politics until it hits them directly. Fix that and the rest will follow.

EDIT: PS
I never indicated that I supported the bank bailouts in anyway. Nothing I have said has indicated that. 
Nor have I suggested i support the budget. 

All I have indicated is that the government has no legal right to remove privrate property without 
paying for it. 

If they decided to give themselves that legal right I am very certain they would be out on their ear in the next election. And given that parliment is not one person I do not think they could get it through a vote anyway. 

the bailouts were hated by the people and at least in part the cause of the current position of the labour government. We have this coalition and relativly weak government at least in part because people are as angry as you about the events of the past. 

If we attack the banks it is not just the politicians that are scared. It is the electorate that have mortgages cars and property part owned by those banks.

I use Proxy Switchy (the one for Chrome) although I'm sure the Firefox one works just as well. 

To find a proxy (I have no idea if the one in that guide still works or not) just google ""free UK proxy"" and several websites will pop up. You may have to try a few before you find one that works so make sure to give yourself a bit of time before the show starts. Once you get one, copy the IP address and Port into whichever extension you are using, Foxy Proxy for Firefox or Proxy Switchy for Chrome, in place of the IP address and port from the guide. 

One thing I've found is you only need the proxy to start the stream - once the video starts to play you can switch back to ""direct connection"" (your normal un-proxified internet access) and the video will continue. This generally gives you better performance as most free proxies are rather slow. I'm not sure if this part will work for iPlayer but it works fine for the live stream.

It's a fairly safe assumption that 8 died in the time war and 9 ""pushed the button"" so to speak very soon after regenerating. I'm basing this off of 10's ""He was born in blood. Who does that remind you of? But you made me better, Rose Tyler"" speech at the end of Journey's End when dealing with 10.5's genocide of the Daleks. 

So, you get 9 who is a soldier running from everything he has seen and done. Now, 10 comes along and he starts to deal with the aftermath - the Lonely God that destroyed the Daleks and the Timelords, two of the most powerful races in the universe. This leaves hims all alone which leads him to slowly realize that the laws of time are solely his to control. He begins to buy into his own supremacy until Adelaide Brook destroys his plan and he breaks down. 

I think it was an excellent storyline for 10 that showed a side of the Doctor we had never seen before.

(/slight-reprimand)

I love this article. Not only because it once again shows that Wil Wheaton, who I hated back in his TNG days because he was prettier than me and got to hug Ashley Judd, is awesome. Not only the fact that he's a Who-fan but his thoughts about DRM are spot on. I'm not sure he'd agree with this, but my reasons for ""illegally"" downloading the most recent episodes are similar to his: I'm going to watch them legally on BBC America eventually. I'll probably even buy the DVDs or Netflix them or something. So is it that wrong that I'm too impatient to wait for the series to catch up to us Yanks and our inferior BBC America? Can't even pay to get BBC1 here, damit. 

Other reasons to like Wil: he's a Redditor, he once owned a comic book store (IIRC), one of his Proud Fatherly Moments was when his son stole his [Choose Your Weapon](http://www.jinx.com/men/shirts/pen_paper_games/dice_choose_weapon.html?catid=23&amp;cs=2&amp;csd=23) shirt, and [his blog](http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/) is awesome.

The change that is needed is in the requirement of the government to respond to the people. The banks should have failed. That is what capitalism means. If we had a government that was afraid for its right to govern then they would never have rescued failing banks.

I don't agree with you that the banks should have been to left fail, I think they should have been nationalised and brought under the control of the people that bailed them out and transformed into social utilities. Again you will have to clarify what you mean by a 'smarter bank'.

You criticise the banks for being allowed to merge into 'stupid mega banks' but the development of monopolies is one of many inherent contradiction of the capitalist system and its supposed 'free market' principles you defend. 

You appear to be under the illusion that capitalism can be reformed into into some kind of smarter, kinder and fairer system. This is exactly the theory the Labour Party was founded upon, and a as history has proven quite clearly, it is a bankrupt theory.

You have a clear choice, capitalism and its economic disasters, wars, starvation and the plundering of the worlds resources and environment for the financial gain of an insignificant minority  or socialism with a scientifically planned economy, where the worlds resources are used to to the benefit and needs of the vast majority... the workers!

true,[deleted],null,null,"I have some insight into this, as I'm currently classed as unable to work due to both intermitent and long term health issues.

If someone, through no fault of thier own, is unable to find secure and life affording work, then they're unable to work and wil be in need to support.

Now if someone is also signifocantly disbaled or sick then they're not only afforded thier cost of living, but they also afforded a benifit which allows them to use thier cost 

of living to meet the same standard as those who are able bodied/minded.

The problem as I see it is this; There are jobs available which are suitable for those with intermitent health issues, there are even jobs available for those who have long term 

health issue. The government recognises this and is trying desperately to push people into them, which on some levels is fair.

However, when it can take upward of 6 months to get a benifit secured and sometimes can be a full time job to fight to get the benifit you lawfully deserve then there is no lee 

way for trying to work. The cost of faililure is just to high.

I can work, no doubt about it, I'm inteligent, I'm educated, I'm able bodied, problem is that I have intemitent and long term health issues which mean I can't be relied upon, I 

can abrely cope with relying upon myself. I literally can't have any job security, even trying to work for myself would be a near impossible task as no one is wiling to take 

into consideration my problems.

An employer, when pickign staff, is not going to pick someone with health issues when so many exist without, it not going to take on the liablility of staff who may not be able 

to work and will likely not be able to give any notice of not being able to work. It's simply not in our market system to allow for this. 

If I try and fail I'm likely dead. While it is nice to know there is a catch net for those who have health issues which is supposed to make it possible to try and fail without 

risking homelessness and bankruptcy, the net has holes in and the people holding the net are lead to believe that many people don't deserve to be caught and so make it near 

impossible for everyone.

Another problem as I see it is a culture which bellives that earning cash money is the only way to be of any worth. I personally have helped out disabled people with housing and 

benifit issues, I've even suported peole through the courts, helped people who in care out of care and into thier own homes, all gratis. Right now I'm trying to get a friend his 

DLA benifit, he is deaf, suffer constant pain and has significant loss of mobility, oh and recently has been blacking our and falling over. He has been denied DLA and is being 

preasured to work and gone on ESA. If you saw his quality of life you would be disgusted, but he muddles through with what he has and he tries harder than most people too. Oh, 

for the record, the reason he deosn't have his benifit comes to down to his Pride, he coudn't clasiffy himself as the amongst the worst cases, even though he is. And now his own 

testimony is being used to hang him... 

Our benifits system is not fit for purpose, it is broken, not only in it's admistration but also in it's conception. It does not do what it is supposed to do and it's not worth 

the money spent on the contractors which perpetually prop it up.

Let me just be clear here, affording all the people the basic cost of living, food, shelter, neccesity and the means to access that, is the purpose of benifits. Supporting those 

in need so that they can contrinbute in whatever way they find is worth more to our nation than only supporting those who can turn a profit on some balance sheet. The cost of 

providing homes, heating, community need, is nothing compared to the long term benifits.

I would say that benifit fraud is anyone who while claiming benifits, over a long period of time, is creating large sums of wealth. It is not, for example, over lapping your 

payment with your new job or working one day a week occasinally for what amounts to no more than additional quality of life for a short period of time.",0,1277485186,null,0,false,0,c0swbgf,t3_cirig,t1_c0swbgf,t3_cirig,null,1426356309,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

And don't forget that work needs to provide upto a certain quality of life, those who have extra need will therefore need higher payed jobs than those who don't. The system we have now doesn't allow for that, our markets are not in tune with the people's needs.

Our culture right now is counter benifits, people belive anyone on benifits is a cheat or a fraud and it just perpetuates the problem because we need real change to make jobs available to everyone and people aren't willing to provide for those that are painted as cheats or frauds, they would rather see them sink to the bottom.",0,1277485475,null,0,false,0,c0swbwl,t3_cirig,t1_c0swbwl,t1_c0svo5k,null,1426356315,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I'm a realist, you're looking at the world through the eyes of child with candy, that £300 a month you pay in taxes is probably the best investment you've ever made in your life.

By investing £300 a month your bring the price of good and services down to a level were you can afford them, by bringing the price down you increase the market accesibility and keep the price down.

Midnight and Turn Left are probably two of the greatest scripts he ever wrote for the show that made the best of the ""mount 2 productions at the same time"" method the show required.  Far better than Love and Monsters anyway.

I'm not going to attack ""The Gay Agenda"" - dude is openly Gay and wants to see that portion of society represented in modern drama, rightly so too.

Neither will I attack the ""Soap Opera"" elements. A young girl dissapears with an alien to travel time and space in an unreliable time machine, why shouldn't we be concerned about the people left behind? There could have been great drama mined out of Tegan's disappearance and her aunt &amp; cousin's murder that was ignored under the old Who.

If I am going to criticise elements of the RTD era it would be:

The musical numbers were just too camp for my taste.

The ""Doctor's Reward"" from The End of Time, that ending could have been much better if the Doctor snap regenerated after his awesome dialogue with Wilfred. ""The Reward"" stank to me of ""Didn't I write some awesome characters? I should remind everyone of that.""  Yes it provided closure for Dr 10 and RTD's era, but at the expense of the drama of impending regeneration.
