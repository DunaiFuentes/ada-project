I don't know what he was talking about in this particular example but broadly (and not in the context of security in the UK) keeping your population alive probably has a higher priority for a government than protecting their civil liberties. 

Students tend to be naive and idealists; they tend to lack an understanding of the complexities of the real world. Politicians in government, on the other hand, have to deal with the realities of governing. There are many situation where they will sacrifice civil liberties (usually minor ones) if they believe it overall protects their population by keepings them safer. Getting the sacrifice/gain combination right is a balance (something complicated) rather than an on/off switch (something very simple) and it's something that all governments do, and all the time. 

Of course you can argue whether what a particular government does to maintain public safety really does or doesn't protect their safety, and you can disagree with whether they've got the balance right, and you can argue about whether a particular country is actually under threat or not - but to say that there is nothing to protect except civil liberties reflects the simple idealism of a politics student, rather than the complex realism of someone that has to actually govern.

&gt; But in January 2010 she told officers she wanted to drop the charges - although she still maintained they were true.

(no prosecution to her yet, but detectives continue to prosecure her husband)

&gt; Detectives said they would continue with the prosecution and by February 11 the wife changed her mind, this time saying the original allegations were false.

Prosecution to her starts at this point. It sound quite logic to me. You cannot make an official and serious accusation to the police and then simply say ""I'm sorry I was wrong"" and get away with it.

On the other hand, the Judge should take the psychological stress of an abusive marriage into account as well, but if this happens then it should work both ways, meaning that the husband could get away with the rape charges, even if they were true, by simply saying ""I did not rape her, she just hates me because I abuse her when I'm drunk"" (which is a much lesser offence than rape)",0,1289278883,null,0,false,0,c14ygg9,t3_e39ie,t1_c14ygg9,t1_c14yedu,null,1426561703,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

However, I discovered Doctor Who earlier this year, fell in love with the show, understandably, but didn't think any of my family members would really relate so I never brought it up much. One night though, at dinner I mentioned something about getting together with a friend and watching some doctor Who. My dad turns to me and said ""Doctor Who?

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"And so she should. Falsely accusing someone of rape completely ruins their lives. End of. 

Let me tell you a brief anecdotal story about a French DJ guy I used to know when I lived in Portobello road ( we'll call him Nick, obviously not his real name ) really nice guy, always happy, not a care in the World till one night he went home with some girl he knew after a gig, they got a bit too drunk, had sex and the next morning when her boyfriend turned up unannounced, not able to find any other excuse she cried rape. 

Now obviously the boyfriend went ballistic  ( as he would ) and chased my mate out of their pad, but by then the seed had been sown, she was marched down to the police station on his insistence and basically confessed to something that had never happened in the first place. I'll also add that this girls boyfriends best friend ( a club promoter ) just happened to be Nicks flatmate at the time i.e. they all knew each other in the first place. 

Nicks life from then on in turned into a living hell, he was arrested, questioned, released on bail after giving up his passport and came home to find all of his stuff thrown into the street, records, clothes etc. He couldn't even argue his case because no one was prepared to listen. He effectively became homeless overnight and spent the next 8 months sleeping on mine and a few others couches in rotation. 

Now because the flatmate who turfed him out was a fairly successful promoter, the word got around the clubs that he was a "" rapists"" and all of his work dried up too. 

Hero to zero in a couple of weeks flat and he couldn't even go home to France. Obviously knowing Nick and knowing that this girl had been flirtatious with him on many occasion there was a group of us who knew that what he was being accused of was way off character and we believed it to be bullshit from the off, but the girls boyfriend was so convinced she was telling the truth it didn't matter, he was guilty. 

8 months of pure hell for the guy, he couldn't even be seen anywhere around west London. I mean there's a lot more to this story including harassment, a pretty nasty beating and a small bit of press attention ( he was quite a well known DJ ) but I don't have all day to go into it really. Let's just say his life became a living hell and in some ways the people protecting him, myself included, got some of it directed our way too. Put it this way, protecting an accused rapist is not a good look and it was even starting to affect my own relationship at one point. 

Anyway cut to, a couple of days before Nicks first court date, the girl  buckled under pressure and the truth came out, she was too drunk and she'd led him on, but by then the damage was done. The girl got away with just a slap on the wrist for wasting police time, he went back to France a completely broken man, his reputation in London shattered beyond repair. 

Now I'm not saying that every case is like Nicks, rape happens, for sure. But for those accused falsely it's a major fucking deal, as I said before it tears their lives apart. No doubt.

There are two possibilities here:

1. She lied about being raped at all.  In this case she damn well deserves to go down for attempting to pervert the course of justice.

2. She was telling the truth about being raped, but then (after pressure from the husband's family) decided she didn't want to press charges.

In this case she should have simply withdrawn the charges, and left the police to act as they would.  As it happens the police apparently felt they had enough to secure a prosecution *even without* her wanting to press matters... but at that point it's out of her hands - she couldn't discourage them from investigating and prosecuting without breaking the law herself, and - sadly, and stupidly - *that's what she chose to do*.

Not to sound cold-hearted, but from the perspective of jurisprudence once she'd reported the crime and the police were investigating she had a simple choice: would I like my husband to go down for rape, or would I like to go down for perverting the course of justice?

She made her choice, and in doing so potentially protected a rapist from the prosecution and conviction he deserved, and she received punishment for it.  Moreover, as the same law also deals with intimidating witnesses in major trials and the like, the precedent for punishment is likely fairly strict.

It really sucks that she was raped, and it really sucks that she was pressured to lie to the police, but ultimately her *actions* were her own choice, perverting the course of justice is a *serious* offence... and sadly what she did is [pretty much the textbook definition of it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverting_the_course_of_justice). :-(",0,1289307575,null,0,true,0,c14zb4t,t3_e39ie,t1_c14zb4t,t1_c14z8gv,null,1426562102,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Worse, they can't even necessarily offer the argument she was raped as mitigating circumstances, largely because *thanks to her own actions* it's almost impossible now to know ""beyond reasonable doubt"" now if she was or not.

FWIW I don't personally know if prison was a good idea - clearly she's had a hell of a time, and I doubt prison on top of it will help matters.

However, the point I was making was that:

1. Your point was totally different to the question of guilt that Skitrel and I were discussing, and

2. Although I don't necessarily agree with imprisoning her, there are other considerations than merely ""OMFG this poor person we must excuse her any and all wrongdoing no matter how serious right away"".

And it's *certainly* nothing to do with ""sent out a 'chilling message' to rape victims"", or being ""still in the dark ages [regarding sexual violence]"", or ""being criminalised for choosing not to pursue her case"".

She was criminalised for *repeatedly lying to the police* - it's an open-and-shut case of someone seeking to pervert of justice, and while there may well be mitigating circumstances, *the suspect herself* has made it unnecessarily hard to investigate them and decide whether they exist or not.

I'm very sad for her, and wouldn't mind a more lenient punishment, but I'm also aware there are more grown-up considerations than ""oooh, poor girl"", and that - while it's tragic - the *conviction* (though not necessarily the punishment) is both justified and at least partly her own fault. :-(",0,1289309450,null,0,false,0,c14zdai,t3_e39ie,t1_c14zdai,t1_c14zbe3,null,1426562129,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I wrote a basic description, and added a rule saying that any non-conformant posts will be deleted.  For now, I think that's probably enough - allow anyone to post as many times as they like (in theory), as long as they follow the basic rules.  As moderators, we can delete any posts that don't follow the rules and tweak the rules if necessary as we go along.

Perhaps if the three of us started by posting to set an example of the kind of thing we think it should contain.  Then we could post a few links to it on other sub-reddits and see if we can drum up some interest.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"&gt;My point is, you seem to trivialise the cause that the so called terrorists are motivated by.

I'm not sure I've outlined my own position sufficiently enough for such a characterisation, so I guess you're writing based on the presumption of my position, in turn based from the fact I disagree with the OP.

To clarify; my key stance on the issue is that it should never be regarded simply as black or white, safety or liberty. There is a very difficult balance to be struck in this vast grey area in-between. The debate however is not helped by either party clinging to simple idealistic rhetoric.

&gt;They aren't just making a point, in their heads they must think they're fighting for their very survival. That mindset is the enemy, not the next poor soul who is talked into vaporizing himself.

I don't disagree that such individuals deserve pity for what they have become, but you generalise where you claim I trivialise. 

The four young lads who blew themselves up on 7-7, were they *'fighting for their survival*? They all lived comfortable lives around the UK, thousands of miles from the Gaza strip. Was it desperation that drove them, or was it disillusionment, zeal and ideology?

They are of course all past answering such a question, but I suspect they were more motivated by religious extremism then desperate survival.

As King Abdullah of Jordan put it in a recent interview with Jon Stewart; it is the idealogical motivated who grapple onto Gaza and use it as political justification for their actions. They are not acting in the defence of the Palestinians as they are to further their own ends.

This is not to say that resolving the situation with the Israelis would not go a long way to help combat extremism, but that it cannot be viewed as the only component and cause.

&gt;I find it interesting that those people are the ones who are shown up as the enemy, it's like criminalising drug users instead of giving them a way out and going after the suppliers.

Such a position is extremely deterministic; you presume individuals have neither self-control or self-responsibility. I don't see it as very credible.",0,1289332058,null,0,false,0,c150rrs,t3_e2v7l,t1_c150rrs,t1_c14z3ke,null,1426562783,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That's certainly one of the levers, yes. But those boys didn't sit in Starbucks and plan the whole thing themselves because they thought it was Allah's will, they were manipulated and exploited. It's a huge concern that citizens of this country can feel disenfranchised enough that they could commit such an act against their countrymen.

true,TermsOfContradiction,null,null,"**Eurofighter Typhoon**

The Typhoon certainly is the highest performing aircraft in the competition. This is a result of its high cost and it being quite new in development. It has not yet proven itself but it has had enough number built to have most of its designed capabilities.

But it is also far and away the most expensive. The Indians though have a mostly unwarranted reverence for their former colonizers, and often covet British equipment simply for being British.

The Indians need a medium weight fighter that can be bought in quantity. They already have the Su-30MKI variants that easily fulfill the role of a high performance air superiority fighter.

If the Typhoon is also added to the fleet they will have significant overlap, and have difficulty maintaining fighter coverage due to high costs of both fighters.

The four nations using diplomatic leverage for the sale is going to come back to bite them down the rode if those planes ever need to be used in combat. China only needs to coerce one of the partners to block future sales to India.

**Mig-29**

The Mig-29s are very tempting as they have a low price, good capabilities, and a proven partner. Not only that but carrier variants could be bought in quantity giving the Indians superb standardization and versatility. But I believe the Indians are intently looking to diversify its suppliers of arms, which means the Russians will be left out.

**Dassault Rafale**

The Rafale looks very good as the French will do just about anything for a big sale, and have impressive aeronautical technology. This makes the Rafale attractive for what it brings to the table as the Indians are insistent on technology transfer. Although like the other Europeans, are susceptible to coercion; as was proven by their turning their backs on Israel out of pressure.

The fighter itself is optimized for ground combat rather than air to air like the Typhoon. As the Indians already have a premier air to air fighter in the Flanker variant Su-30MKI, the Rafale would compliment the assets of the fleet rather well. And of course Naval variants could be bought to fly off of India's up and coming Carriers, adding an excellent capability and standardization.

**Gripen NG**

The Gripen is well positioned in this competition but the Indians do not seem to be looking for the things the Gripen does particularly well. It would an excellent choice but I am guessing the Indians want to buy prestige along with their new fighter.

The Gripen is the smallest of the fighters competing and has a number of advantages. It is cheap, needs only small runways, can use most western munitions, is easy to maintain, and is optimized for ground attack. This would allow India to buy a greater number and have more sorties, availability, and fighter coverage.

But the version the Swedes are offering to India is still being developed (it is not the current variant in the Swedish inventory). This introduces an element of risk to this option.

The Gripen NG's engine is also the same engine that was selected to power India's indigenous fighter; Tejas. This would add to standardization and further reduce costs.

The Swedish government is aggressive in selling the Gripen, and often seeks to undercut their competition. I see them as being unbeatable on price. The Swedes do not do as much trade with China or Pakistan, have proven they will sell to less than admirable governments, and are willing to transfer technology.

**Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet**

The F-18 Super Hornet from the Americans has the same advantages as the Rafale and Mig-29 in that it is Carrier capable. Although the Indians did not specify this requirement, they are going to be using larger carriers soon and it would be prudent of them to buy this capability.

Aerodynamically and performance wise the F-18 lags behind most other modern fighters. But it makes up for this by being extremely versatile, reliable, and ubiquitous.

The US buys these in large batches and has done so for years, and it will require no development for the Indians. This makes the Super Hornet the most risk free of all the options.

Being the main fighter of the US Navy it can deploy a very capable and varied set of weapons, fuel tanks, and sensors. The Super Hornet out classes every other fighter by a wide margin in these categories, and 
only gives ground to the competition in raw performance.

**Lockheed Martin F-16**

The F-16 is the smallest fighter here except for the Gripen. It has been used all around the world and without a doubt has the most proven track record. It has made air to air victories more than once, and proved its self in war to many professionals all over the world.

As it is used all around the world the Indians will have more options than just the US for upgrades or maintenance, an important point as the Indians covet their independence.

The F-16 is less expensive than most and still has the air to air capabilities to be competitive. The F-16 has a solid reputation for being a smart and efficient choice for nations. This combination has made the F-16 popular the world over; which in turn further reduces its cost and increases versatility.

Like the F-18 it offers impressive versatility in munitions. But unlike the F-18, Rafale and Mig-29; it does not have carrier capabilities. And it also does not have the type of refueling that the Indians require, this is being developed though.

**The US as a factor**  

The Indians see a buy from the Americans as a double edged sword. They want a powerful ally to help them with China (the Americans qualify), and to not bow to pressure from the Chinese (the Americans are strong enough to resist).

But they also want no restrictions on what they do or how they use the equipment they are buying, which the Americans are known to do. And technology transfer is a very important part of this competition, the US has traditionally been reluctant to share technology. It appears now that the Americans are relaxing some of their rules to accommodate them. Whether or not this will satisfy the Indians is unknown.

Bale has been sussed by premiership teams, so he needs to change his game or get better at what he does. Or be moved back to left back, you can't double mark a left back.

Bale being double marked isn't a bad thing, in fact it's pretty much part and parcel of being the 'next big thing'. The fact we have such a potent midfield should mean we can exploit teams paying too much attention to one person by having massive amounts of space elsewhere. He can take a kicking (hopefully) but I 100% agree about him being an unmarkable left back, which is p much what I've always felt he was. To say he's been ""sussed"" is a big call, although Turner showed how to deal with his crosses.


I hope Modrić keeps up with what he's been saying for a bit. He seems Tottenham through and through. To say bad things about him is simply blasphemy. He played the killer ball against Inter (for one example) but the fact is he plays a bit further back than most people think goes against him. The only complaint is his shooting which actually looks a lot better this year.

I kind of agree that Bentley may need to go. I felt he cost too much when we brought him in (especially when we had Lennon) and in general he doesn't fit our formation. However he is a Spurs man and seems like a good bloke in the dressing room, especially under Arry.

We think this has one fundamental flaw, as illegal filesharers will simply hack into other peoples WiFi networks to do their dirty work. This will result in innocent people being disconnected from the internet. What's more, such a punishment should be dealt with in the proper way, in a court of law. This guilty until proven innocent approach violates basic human rights.

&gt; It is clear that online copyright infringement inflicts considerable damage on the UK’s creative economy including music, TV and film, games, sports and software. Industry estimates place this harm at £400m pa.

&gt; The Digital Economy Act includes a number of measures to tackle the problem and we expect these to be successful in significantly reducing online copyright infringement. However this is an area of rapid technological change and developing consumer behaviour. The Act therefore includes a reserve power to introduce further “technical” measures if the initial measures do not succeed.

I agree. I would even go as far as to say that there should be decent alternatives to university for those who aren't academically gifted enough to go, or for those who don't want to go.

Not sure why this is relevant. Just because it was free at some point in time, doesn't mean it should remain free. Indeed, it was Labour who decided to completely abolish the grant system anyway. Not the people in Government.

&gt; and we have to pay for their mistakes. Punish the bankers, not the students.

The current deficit and debt is not entirely due to the reckless actions of the banks (which, FWIW, is in part due to the wrecking of our financial regulatory system by Brown. He was also a cheerleader for them - until the shit hit the fan). 

A lot of the current deficit/debt is actually due to 13 years of Labour economic mismanagement. Spending *well* above their means, long before the credit crunch hit. When we actually needed the money to get through the recession, we had to borrow even more on top of other borrowing. 

Anyway - we hold shares in the failed banks. When the market looks up, we should be able to offload them for quite a profit. It'll help pay down the debt that Labour racked up. And I don't see why we should punish bankers in more solvent banks (i.e Barclays, who didn't take a penny of public money IIRC).

There's also the question of contracts - are the bankers getting what their contract entitled them to? It'd probably cost more to pay the legal bills of the eventual lawsuits if they sued for breach of contract.

&gt; It's not just about the money. Nick Clegg made promises, promises that were the basis for his election. 

Things change when you have to compromise (the Lib Dems are a *very* junior partner in this government, so it isn't a 50/50 split), and when the full scale of our financial situation is known. Will Clegg be crucified in the next general election? Probably.

&gt; We elect people based on their policies, and I don't think it's unreasonable to expect them to stick by them.

Assuming that the Lib Dems got their own way on this issue, would you expect them to do it even though the cuts are needed to help get us out of the excrement? BTW, it's not ""free"" - it's £3290 this year and even that is highly subsidised by the taxpayer.

Sometimes I think students have a ""single track"" mind.

A standard 3 year course in a £9k a year university with around £3k a year in maintenance loans would leave many students in around £40k of debt. 

Even with the fact that you don't have to start paying it until you are earning more than £15k a year and you can pay it over many years... it's still way too much.

I've taught myself all I know in IT since the 8 or 9 years old and it really irks me to see these idiots walking out of such a highly-acclaimed establishment with a certification that says they ought to be smarter than me when they can't tell me the first thing about the concept of a kernel or like you say, how to use a certain common protocol.

I've had the same argument countless times with various people that education these days, particularly pertaining to IT is next to worthless. You can force-feed information as much as you like, but if the individual isn't going to think for him/herself and doesn't have the deep-rooted interest in the actual subject at hand, they shouldn't be on a course for it that ends up proclaiming their (lack of) proficiency in the field. It's shocking how many people argue the toss, but they're not entirely wrong because employers *still* actually consider degrees to be a formidable piece of evidence in determining an individual's competency, which is true for a handful of degrees, but certainly not one in IT (or anything in the arts, except for perhaps architecture).

It was only Blackburn who we dominated and that to me seemed like because they were intimidated at Anfield and also missing their main defenders.

Only one of those conflicts could be argued to be ""the good fight"" but only we fought Germany as a rival superpower. We didn't care one iota about their crimes against humanity. After the war we rewrote history to present ourselves as the good guys, see [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Living_Dead_%28television_documentary_series%29#On_the_Desperate_Edge_of_Now_.2830_May_1995.29) fascinating BBC documentary on the subject.

Which pretty much was the case in past remembrance days. Ever since the two unpopular wars in Iraq/Afghanistan there has been a concerted effort to anchor the current conflicts against previous ones. Witness for example today's coverage, with discussion of a new graveyard for troops who were killed in Afghanistan.

Wow.  This is a direct import of pro-military, nationalist, American ideology into our national discourse.

The two minutes' silence is about *remembering fallen* soldiers, not glorifying serving ones.  It's about remembering the sacrifice past soldiers have made to ensure our freedom, not about supporting soldiers currently serving in (arguably) foreign wars of aggression.

The main event is even called *Remembrance* Sunday, FFS - not ""Jingoistic Army Cheerleading Day"".  It's not about thinking the Army is a good thing - it's about giving thanks and remembering the individual men and women *in the past* who sacrificed their lives for their country and way of life.

Perhaps you expressed yourself inelegantly, but this bullshit, propaganda, brainwashing ""support our troops"" mantra is one of the most insidious and toxic memes in the USA, as it provides a ready-made label useful to smear and dismiss anyone who ever argues that anything other than all-out, constant, total war might be a good thing.

Moreover, in this country it's perfectly fine to ""not support our troops"" - this isn't the USA, and individuals *can* legitimately express disapproval of the armed forces without instantly and unfairly being buried under the weight of public approbation... and I for one would like to keep it that way.

* Someone who puts his life at risk to defend our way of life deserves praise and gratitude, sure.

He's not taken any inherent decision to protect or serve or dedicate himself to a higher cause - he's just gone with the flow, and his actions are only as moral or immoral as his orders.

* Someone who takes part in an unprovoked war of aggression (or in the extreme case commits war-crimes) does not.

Basically, anyone who joins the Army risks putting his life on the line.  This can be a noble, praiseworthy thing or it can be a stupid, naive and overly trusting thing, depending entirely on the soldier's beliefs, conscience, priorities, the morality of the orders he's given and whether he even thinks about it in those terms before he does it.

Equally, your reasoning would mean that - for example - German soldiers in WWII should be lauded for ""putting their lives on the line"" and not condemned for ""only following orders"", and only the generals and politicians should be blamed for the atrocities committed as a result.

Presumably, then, had you been born in Germany you would also have been enthusiastically cheering on the Third Reich, and excusing the soldiers who shot Jewish prisoners on command?

This may sound like Godwinning you, but it's *completely* on-topic and appropriate.  If you argue that individual soldiers bear no moral responsibility for their actions then you lose the right to criticise individual soldiers for their actions, even when those actions are - for example - taking part in the Holocaust.

Equally,  assume you also ""support"" soldiers who have recently been found to have tortured prisoners in Afghan and Iraqi jails?  After all, they were *only following orders*... so while those orders may have directed them to break international law and torture even innocent people, do you still support them?

Please note there that I'm not even arguing you *shouldn't* support most soldiers you ever come across - I'm just arguing against the kind of simplistic, emotional assessments you're making, because they're dangerous and incomplete.  However, as you're so gung-ho to support the military, I'm forced to argue the other side as a counter-balance.  As I said, I'm, actually on the fence because it's a tricky, nuanced situation with no clear single ""right"" answer for every situation.

&gt; However, lauding soldiers for the sacrifices they make and the incredibly difficult job they do is not the beginning of the path that leads to militarism.

Actually, lauding soldiers *no matter what they do* is exactly what leads to unthinking militarism.  It's more or less the definition of it.

As I said, I *respect* anyone who puts his life on the line to protect his country, but that doesn't mean that automatic level of respect can't be outweighed by other factors... for example torture, war-crimes, breaking international law and the like.

That *is* taking a step back and easing off - I refuse to jump to any conclusion, and if you read my previous comment you'll find that it's actually neutral on the question of supporting troops or not... even in the case they're ordered to do so.  Once *again*, even military and international law agrees with me here, so I'm nto sure on what basis you disregard it.  Presumably international legal precedents are ""over analysis"" too? &lt;:-)

What you've done is take a short-sighted, emotional position that fixates on one particular factor and misses half the important considerations of the subject, baselessly dismissed all the important details and arguments you've blithely ignored as ""over-analysis"", and then claimed that this short-sighted, incomplete position is somehow *more valid* than a more comprehensive analysis.

Right at the point where you criticised me for assessing the specific motivations and actions of individual soldiers:

&gt; Wow, congratulations for completely over theorising what is essentially quite a simple choice.

And said:

&gt; ""Support our troops"" is not emotive brain washing, its a simple statement that says ""I respect the people who are prepared to put their ass on the line IF the shit hits the fan.

Instead of ""I afford them respect for putting their lives on the line, but that doesn't mean you always *have* to support them, no matter *what* they do""... which was, in a nutshell, my entire point.

Moreover, given the scale of the reports there's a good chance that ""those cunts"" were [merely following orders](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/nov/05/interrogation-techniques-iraq-inmates)... which would (according to your own arguments) prohibit you from calling them ""cunts"" at all, as the beatings and the whippings and the stress positions and the humiliation and all the other illegal acts would then be the fault of the politicians, not the individual soldiers.  Even though they were *at no stage* in fear of their lives for refusing to comply with the orders.

&gt; Oh for fucks sake, it never takes long does it? You are comparing British soldiers of today, not one of whom I have met that would willingly kill a civilian, to the systematic torture, rape and murder of millions of jews? And you are calling my argument emotional?

Sigh.  No, that was a qualitative analogy, not a quantitative one.

It was taking your stated reasoning process and applying it in a related, equally-applicable situation that you nevertheless feel differently about, to demonstrate how *your own arguments* lead to a conclusion you disagreed-with.

It's a debating tactic used to demonstrate that either your own reasoning process is flawed, or that you're a hypocrite because you'll inconsistently apply one rule for ""us"" and one rule for ""them"", with (by implication) no good reason as to why and when you switch rules.

If I say something simplistic and stupid like ""you should always support your nation's army"", and then you point out that by that logic everyone in Germany should have supported the third Reich, you have demonstrated to me that my assertion is incorrect... because either I have to accept that it was justified for Germans to support Hitler, or I have to arbitrarily switch arguments and say ""um... no... it wasn't justified for Germans because Hitler was evil, but it's justified for us to support *our* army... because... uh... our leaders are always moral, virtuous and good...?""

Here, then, you've identified a factual inaccuracy (well, let's be nice and say ""unrecognised assumption"") in my thinking that may well form the basis of my entire position... and which (precisely because it was unrecognised, and hence ill-considered) may very probably be wrong.  In this example it comes down to a retarded assumption of ""us=good, them=bad"", which is so simplistic that it should be obvious to anyone why it's not a reasonable, consistent assumption to build a general position on.

Admittedly this can *seem* to some emotional people like a quantitative equivalence (in this case between the modern British Army and the Third Reich), but that's what we call a *misinterpretation* caused by *not thinking about the other person's arguments* and *jumping to conclusions* so you can dismiss their points without engaging with them (or, if we're *not* being charitable in our assumptions: ""jumping to conclusions and not being very bright"" &lt;:-).

Moreover, by your use of the phrase ""Oh for fucks sake, it never takes long does it?"" I would submit that you were positively *waiting* for me to claim some equivalence between Britain and the Third Reich, because you apparently firmly believe that I hate the UK, or the Army, or whatever.

And that's doubly stupid, because - as I keep re-iterating to you - my position is *it is a nuanced issue on which it is difficult to come to any simple conclusion*.

&gt;I can't see why I should sympathise if/when they get their leg blown off by an IED planted by some kid just trying to defend his home from aggressors.


Here's why I have a problem with this. Kids do not run around planting IED's to defend themselves from the nasty Brits. Planting an IED is a relatively complex procedure, and would be best left to someone well versed. Even if it was planted by a child it has been shown time and time again all over the world that child soldiers are often manipulated by elders to do these things, and one should not assume the child is acting on his own strong political beliefs. When briefed by military intelligence we were told time and time again the technology for many of these devices came from Iran (see PIRIEDS) supporting the Shiite militia - which in turn strengthens the militias hold on it's area, which in turn strengthens Iran's position when the day comes that Iraq must stand on it's own. In terms of atrocities, I would ask you to re-think your terminology. When I was in Basra, we were mortared and rocketed daily by the militia - using rockets that were supplied by guess who? Saddam's stockpiles only lasted so long. By the way - when the rockets came from a civilian area, as they VERY often did, we would not return fire. Our rules of engagement are very strict, and we may not fire unless our lives are in mortal danger. The militias however, would quite often be the culprits when the Americans or the Brits found however many severed heads in a ditch. Don't make the mistake of thinking the Iraqi militias fit in with your idea of an honourable resistance.

Chelsea have announced they are not renewing the contract of assistant manager Ray Wilkins and that he is to leave the club with immediate effect.

Wilkins, 54, rejoined Chelsea's coaching staff for a second time in 2008 to work under Luiz Felipe Scolari.

He stayed when Guus Hiddink came in and remained when Carlo Ancelotti was named manger ahead of the 2009-2010 season.

Chelsea's chief executive Ron Gourlay said: ""I would like to thank Ray for everything he has done for Chelsea.""

He added: ""We all wish him well for the future.""

Wilkins - who enjoyed a distinguished playing career with spells at Chelsea, Manchester United, AC Milan and QPR amongst others - was on the bench for the clubs's 1-0 win over Fulham on Wednesday.

No reason has been given for the decision not to renew the contract of Wilkins, who managed QPR and Fulham in the mid-1990s.

Chelsea are the reigning Premier League champions, and top this season's table with just under a third of the fixtures gone.

Wilkins is a fluent Italian speaker, and has been credited with maintaining strong links between the players and the coaching staff at Stamford Bridge. ",0,1289490106,null,0,false,0,c158t34,t3_e4lnt,t1_c158t34,t3_e4lnt,null,1426566581,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

So basically if he was offered a job as say a labourer on a building site and turned it down he's going to lose his benefits for three months. I mean that's what's going to happen, they'll offer you any old job and you'll have to take it regardless of how menial it may be.

They were, for want of a better phrase: Completely fucking useless.

My position is that one should not *automatically* and *thoughtlessly* support the troops, because it's a nuanced issue with good arguments for and against supporting the Army and individual soldiers.

[In response to this](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/e4j7z/two_minutes_silence/c158gko) JakeyG disagreed, claimed that considering all the factors I brought up was ""over-analysis"", and stating once again that troops deserved support *simply for the fact they were troops*.

Just to really hammer the point home, he then explicitly disagreed with the statement:

&gt; ""automatically lauding soldiers simply because they're soldiers is an incredibly dangerous precedent to set""

Which kind of suggests he thinks we should support and laud soldiers *simply for the fact they're soldiers*,... no?

My point with the Germany example was that no, you shouldn't always *automatically* laud a soldier ""simply for being a soldier"", because sometimes soldiers do things bad enough to outweigh any initial respect they get - for example, taking part in the Holocaust would (I hope) prohibit a soldier from being respected, because the horror of the actions they helped perpetrate would more than outweigh any ""starter"" respect they'd get simply for joining the armed forces.

In disagreeing with that position, he is apparently arguing the other side - that one should respect soldiers *simply for being soldiers* - though when I raised the Third Reich and Afghanistan/Iraq torture examples example he reversed his position on a penny, and suddenly started acting as if you *could* blame individual soldiers for atrocities, even if they were ""just following orders""... without actually acknowledging what he'd done, or that it was inconsistent with his (apparent) earlier position.

&gt; You call JakeyG's position over-simplified - and yet you fail to see this in your own comments?

Honestly, in this example, yes.  I claimed it was nuanced and complex, with many different factors to consider, and that I didn't have a good, definite answer either way.

JakeyG dismissed almost all of the considerations as ""over-analysis"", and offered in exchange only a simplistic, emotionally-lead, over-generalised bumper-sticker slogan in exchange that (as I tried to demonstrate) *even he* doesn't apply consistently.

If he's arguing that one should respect troops for putting their lives on the line but that subsequent bad behaviour can wipe out that initial respect then we agree, but that's [what I said right back at the beginning](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/e4j7z/two_minutes_silence/c158fch), and he disagreed-with.

If he in fact agrees with me, take it up with him for wrongly disagreeing.

If he *doesn't* agree that it's a complex subject, and he stands behind the claim ""you should always support the troops no matter what they do"" then his argument *is* over-simplified and applied inconsistently.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"Pretty much, yeah... but let me explain my **opinion**:

There's more than one reason that someone might not get that IT job they want - maybe they basically suck at their field and no one wants to hire them, standards could have changed, or maybe there are simply too many qualified people in that field and not enough jobs. If any of those things are the case then you (or other people in your field) are going to have to look for work elsewhere eventually.

It's not like anyone has an entitlement to work in the field of their choice either. If there's no jobs available in that field but there are other jobs that you can do, at some point ***after a reasonable amount of time***, you are basically going to have to lower your standards. Now maybe not a cleaning offices job, although I suppose eventually that could be the case.

I mean, by all means don't take that job they offer... but then why should you be entitled to unemployment benefits for years on end when you're turning down jobs that you can actually do?

Of course before they start offering you these positions themselves, you should take the initiative and take a look at the wider job market ***yourself*** and see what else you can reasonably do. If you can't do that after a few ***years*** of effort looking for a job then they really do need to step in and help you!

They do, by the way, look for suitable positions depending on your skills... so I wouldn't worry extensively about that... if you end up being offered a cleaning job then you might be in a worse position in the job market than you think.

Maybe another question might be: Why *wouldn't* you take a job cleaning offices if you're at a point where no one will hire you and you're living off some meagre weekly benefits? You'd be better off than you are currently with a job like that. You're not really doing much otherwise after 2-3 years of sending out CVs to every position you can find and you're basically doing what?

true,[deleted],null,null,"My 17 year-old brother signed up to the military for 22 years in 1995. Way before the fashionable talk of a corrupt military and useless wars. He signed up because he had been in CCF (combined cadet force) at school and (as a result of undiagnosed, until it was too late, dyslexia) it was really the only thing he was any good at. Upon leaving the school system, which had utterly failed him, with a paltry selection of GCSEs grade D and below he had a couple of jobs, which he failed at. Suffering from what we now suspect was depression, he eventually joined the military as the lesser of several unappealing directions, not the least of which was jail. 

Since then (and admittedly in an unlikely turn of events) he has become an extremely successful and highly qualified bomb disposal expert. His loyalty is to his colleagues. He has completed one tour in Iraq and two tours in Afghanistan. The most recent tour in Afghanistan saw 8 bomb disposal experts go out and only 4 return. He goes through his contact list on his phone and it is peppered with fallen brothers. He is 32. Can you imagine for a moment what that might be like?

&gt; some kid just trying to defend his home from aggressors.

That's what a lot of the people in our military believe they are doing too. Why do you extend the benefit of the doubt to those planting IEDs, but not the British troops in Iraq/Afghanistan? If someone is out there as an army doctor and get their leg blown off, do you have sympathy for them?

&gt; It's not a popular opinion by any means but it's how I feel. Hey, you asked ;)

Well, it is on reddit. 

Lets be clear. I do not support this war. Any discussion of the troops however is, I feel, a red herring, and as such please view my previous questions as rhetorical. It's like saying all the fish in one part of the river are dead and investigating that part of the river, when really the interesting part is the mercury pumping factory upstream. Until we look at the money trail, arms dealers, Blackwater, Halliburton, etc and dismantle their power over our political system we will not see an end to these expensive for us, but lucrative for some, wars. There will always be marginalised and disaffected youth who see no other real choice, but to join a military where job and housing is provided. 

I believe that your assessment of the war is correct, but I differ on your view of the military. My view on the military is that it is a historically valuable (WWII being everyone's darling example) but oft mis-used tool.

obviously, you're on job seekers to look for job and should be actively seeking work, but there's a difference between making reasonable effort to become employed, and being forced into a job that you do not want to do- or even poses you with extreme hardship. 

there is nothing to protect job seekers from being coerced into accepting a job that might be horrendously impractical- i.e. travel costs outweighing or breaking even with wage/working unsuitable hours when they have children to look after. Or what about the people claiming because they are *too ill to work*? They turn down a job because they physically can't do it. Are they penalised? 

the attitude that ANY job will do is not necessarily the right track to take. i know my examples might be a minority issue, but that doesn't make them less concerning.

i'm not arguing that people on job seekers shouldn't be encouraged to find work. being on job seekers should be a last resort. we shouldn't have these high levels of unemployment, but we do, and we as a country have to be prepared to support that. if the government wants to save money through benefits, stop cutting so many jobs and putting people in this position. there are other ways to fill the deficit.

Sure, it's a paper flower steeped with symbolism. I accept that. And be sure that I am not here to say that I condone it or think it's a good idea. But let's have a look at the symbolism of that poppy. What does it mean to burn a poppy? It is a statement of the utmost contempt of British soldiers, conscripted or otherwise, who died in service. I am not saying I agree with that - I really don't, I think it's appalling. What I am saying is that we cannot deny them the right to make that statement, no matter how hateful or odious it is. One is so quick to point out that these soldiers died for the freedom that allowed these statements to be made. Now, if one is a such a fan of freedom, then how does it make any sense to claim the protesters had no right to communicate their message? In fact, it seems that claiming that they have no right to disrespect soldiers like this which is the real disrespect to the soldiers, since that is the statement which stops freedom of speech, for which, allegedly, these soldiers died.

Message boards require somebody to put forward the cash for a server up front, along with either code the message board or download one pre-made and hope that it doesn't come with any SQL injection flaws that allow script kiddies access to your server.

Plus they're not really all that great for real time communication, it requires constantly refreshing a thread to see if there have been any replies whereas the IRC servers just pass messages straight on to anybody in relevant channels.

Heck you don't even need specialised software to connect to IRC channels, there are web based IRC clients, chances are if you've ever used a chat room built into a web page it's actually connecting to an IRC server and joining a channel for you but hiding the details from you :p

IRC is just Internet Relay Chat btw in case you were wondering :p

(Just found freenode does have it's own web based client: [Here](http://webchat.freenode.net/))

Edit: Also wanted to mention lots of things have both forums and IRC channels, they're not mutually exclusive, ones much better if you want to ask a question and you're not fussed on when you get the answer, the other if you're looking for help urgently, also, a forum for a site like reddit, which in itself is kind of like a forum, would be kind of redundant :p",0,1289509097,null,0,true,0,c15a4sb,t3_e47b2,t1_c15a4sb,t1_c159nw9,null,1426567214,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Therefore that is approximately 36 hours of private study that is expected in addition to ~18 contact hours a week (labs and lectures). That comes to ~54 hours a week.

Think about the situation: Lib Dems could either:

 * Refuse the coalition on principle and probably end up with another election and a good chance that the tories would take complete power.
 * **or** Form coalition and try to shift tory policies as much towards their own as they can manage.

Damned if they do, damned if they don't. Did they make the right choice?

Tricky either way, but I think either decision could be made with the even with good moral guidance: one has a good ideological outcome, and the other a good real-world outcome.

But now Clegg gets the blame for something he has no real power over.

What he ***wants*** to say right now is: I really don't agree with the new policies.

He ***can't*** say this because he's the freaking deputy PM. He's basically admitting a mistake that he never even made because he's stuck between a rock and ten more rocks!

Now you all tell me: What would you, or what can he, realistically do in the position he's in?

In my opinion what he's doing now is screwing over his own future in a way that doesn't benefit him or his party at all, but he's not doing this for his own gain, he just doesn't have much manoeuvring space... and yet we're piling all the blame on him...

I guess we need a scapegoat? Is blaming the Tories too difficult for the general public since they just voted them into power a few months ago?? Yes that's right: We made a big fucking mistake this last election, but tough shit, you're dealing with it now.

Now, I know most of us around here probably voted Lib Dems so this doesn't necessarily apply to a lot of Redditors because it's the people who voted Tory that really got us these new policies. Yes, make no mistake about it: these are Tory policies.

If Lib Dems had got a majority and then Nick Clegg went back on his word then there would really be no doubt about his betrayal, but this is simply not the case. As I mentioned above, this is the last thing he wants right now and he's out there saying he never should have made the promise because rightly blaming the Tories isn't something he can easily do at the moment.

Oh well, enjoy your scapegoat everyone! I hope it makes you feel better now that you think you have someone to blame.

**Edit/Note:** I'm not necessarily saying Nick Clegg is the second coming of Christ here, I'm just pointing out that all this focus on him is irrelevant crap because in reality this has nothing to do with him. Maybe Nick Clegg would have betrayed us and broken his promises. Maybe he wouldn't. The current situation is **no indication whatsoever** of this.

STEM subjects should be held sacred because they actually teach methods - for example in Physics you are taught how to solve PDE's etc. and in Engineering how to design circuits or whatever which you can then go on to use.

It's an improvement on just about every level. Hell- it effectively locks the Conservatives out of power outright in the North, with Labour and Lib Dem preferences both likely to go to each other and fourth parties over the Conservatives, if you want to look at it from a tribal perspective.

&gt; Hari makes two mistakes re economics. Firstly he seems to be under the impression that their exists a solution to the country's current financial difficulties that could be described as Keynesian. There isn't. Keynes put forward the idea that governments should indeed spend money to help a country out of recession, but only after the government had pursued a tight fiscal policy during the economic good times. The last government did not do this. They just kept on spending. They did not keep to the other side of the Keynesian bargain.

&gt; He also makes the error of seeing that UK government debt was far higher for most of the past three centuries and concluding that the current rate of borrowing is therefore nothing to worry about. What he doesn't seem to realize is that for most of that three hundred year period Britain was at war. The debt rose steadily over the 18th century as Britain fought Marlborough's wars, the American War of Independence and the Napoleonic Wars. It began a long decline after Waterloo only to rocket again during WW1 not returning below 50% of GDP until the 1970s. Hari seems to be arguing that wartime levels of borrowing are sustainable and desirable in peacetime.

&gt; Hari states that ""debt was more than twice this level in 1945, and we still built the NHS and secured decades of prosperity"". Britain was only able to do this because the country was bailed out after WW2 by American aid under the Marshall Plan. Where does Hari suggest we find a similar injection of cash to that to bankroll the kind of state spending he seems to believe essential?

&gt; Here is the flaw in the leftist ""spend, borrow, spend some more"" argument. There are no pots of free money lying around. Every penny the government spends has to be either borrowed which means that vast amounts of taxpayer's money disappears in interest payments to holders of government bonds. Or else it has to be raised via taxation, and every rise in taxes has a cost in terms of damping down economic activity. And I do mean EVERY rise in taxes, there are no ""tax the fat cats, squeeze the bankers"" devices where vast amounts of money can be raised at no cost to the country's economic competitiveness.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but there was a third option.

The Lib Dems could have signed a memorandum of understanding with the Conservatives; not a full coallition, but agreement to lend their support on key policies in a tit-for-tat agreement for conservative support on a few of their own policies, leaving them free to oppose the Conservatives where they felt they needed too. It would have given them disproportional negotiating power on legislation to their number of MP's, due to maintaining their position as King-maker.

Of course, doing that they'd never have gotten what they really wanted; a referendum on the electoral system. Neither Labour or Conservatives would have supported a move that would loose them power.

This way Clegg thought he would have a shot at getting an electoral system more favourable to his parties base, allowing them a better chance of gaining a majority in the future. What he didn't realise is quite how much damage aligning his party with their ideological opponents would do to his support before he could get to that referendum.

In other words; Clegg tried to play the long game, but is getting punished for selling out his parties ideals for a chance of real power.

Because we can do that in a day. We went in and obliterated the place (thanks, Labour), we might as well stay and help clean up.

&gt; increase rather than cut corporation tax, increase vastly taxation on income above £250,000 per annum

And watch as companies and the wealthy piss off to ""business-friendly"" countries. It's better to get 20% of their profits/income rather than 100% of bugger all. This began to happen under Labour - I think a pharmaceuticals firm moved their tax domicile to Ireland. 

It is also worth noting that it isn't necessarily the tax rate, but the tax code. Labour's overcomplicated tax code (it ballooned under their watch) has more holes than the finest Swiss cheese, ripe for anyone to do a bit of tax avoidance (which is not the same as tax evasion - the latter is illegal).

Why? I don't see why money/entities that have already been taxed, should be taxed again. If anything it should be lowered.

Now back to the proper order:

We do not need nuclear arms, of this I am pretty unshakably convinced.
Even if you think their is somehow an argument for the ability to wipe out the human race instantaneously our tridents compared to the US stock pile *who we cant use trident without* makes trident look like a pair of inter continental ballistic toothpicks. we're not an empire, we're never going to use trident on our own, we don't need to or have any right to police the world, we don't need nuclear weapons.

Help and clean up is a phrase I've heard many times in relation to Afghanistan, what we're doing is attempting to install a pro western, corrupt and ultimately futile regime which is heavily funded by and invested in the opium crop of Afghanistan something which in itself will end the regime eventually be it sooner or later.
Second to that is the level of infiltration of all the internal institutions by the Taliban and the fact that as soon as you take away the massive investment in the country (which we cannot afford) the government will collapse like the house of cards it is, why not remove that investment now and let the global corporations with ideas of nicking off with all the natural wealth of the nation fend for themselves.
whilst the grand game of divide and conquer that America is attempting to play in the middle east has global effects I think If I am honest that a stable and internally controlled power block is in some respects preferable in terms of global power, though wither global capitalism and specifically America can accept that I'm not sure, I don’t think we have any need to be their to try and decide that, certainly the local population has no love for us nor ever will, they remember our previous forays when we got our ass handed to us.

Globalisation is something we have to come to terms with in one way or another, whilst there is a balancing act to be played just saying outright that if we increase tax everyone is going to run away is bollocks. 
Top flight earners which that certainly applies to will almost certainly find ways to avoid tax and labour did attempt to try and prevent that, its a fairly strangely and in places badly shaped thing but we need something like it in order to achieve tax accountability, simplifying tax will ultimately lead to more tax evasion and even less revenue from those most able to pay.

Inheritance tax is important as a social leveller, someone with a huge estate of which there are many will no doubt have had time to hand around quite a bit of funds to those who they see fit to during their lives, instead of their favourite charity getting a huge lump of money how about paying for some vital services.

The reforms I have kept my eye on thus far I know exactly what they’ll do, further ruin areas of the city I live in and take us further away from any kind as fair society, labour had their faults rather too many to be palatable, but at least they thought it might be a nice idea that people had more of a chance to be socially mobile based on merit, something this government has proven very strongly they do not believe.

The deficit was at 10% at the time of the election. That's not great, but it's definitely no crisis. The cuts that are being implemented will, most likely, cut that deficit right back. But what's the rush? The deficit post-war was HUGE by comparison, but the decades that followed saw the development of most of the major elements of the (expensive) welfare system. The reasons for the cuts are obscure to me: a weird mix of Thatcherite principles and the desire to be able to say 'look how we reduced the deficit' come the next general election. But even if significant cuts are necessary, education is just not an area we can afford to make them.  
 My point is not an economic one: the Browne Review talks of education as if the only point to it is the benefit is has to the wider economy. The economic benefits of higher education are secondary to the benefits it has to individuals as a force for intellectual freedom and a wider sense of fulfilment in life, and the benefits it has for society for the public to be better informed, hence making better voting decisions. It is a hangover from Thatcher to see every element of society as valued solely monetarily.

I'd also disagree with you when you say the lib dems have no power. They can pull out of the coalition and stop the Tories in their tracks. This is what I'd like to see happen. I have no problem with David Cameron being PM, he got the most votes. But why do we need a majority government? Why not let MPs vote on individual policies as they see fit, and based on how they feel it help their constituents. If this happened the government would actually have to provide evidence as to why they are suggesting the policies they put in front of the house. 

To many people who voted lib deem, and I include myself in this, it feels as if the lib deems sold their soul in order to get a referendum on voting methods. The liber democrats are supposed to be fairly liberal, and committed to democracy but now they're helping to push through conservative policies that only a third of voters actually voted for, and that seems neither liberal nor particularly democratic.

There are a number of buses that go from Campus to the centre of town. The website for the Brighton buses is conveniently http://www.buses.co.uk and I know the [number 25](http://www.buses.co.uk/travel/service.aspx?serviceid=50) does this journey. Just had a look and it takes about 25 minutes from campus to town. You can buy monthly bus passes from [One stop travel](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=one+stop+travel+st+james+street+brighton&amp;sll=50.821238,-0.137372&amp;sspn=0.001989,0.004131&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=one+stop+travel&amp;hnear=St+James+St,+Brighton,+Brighton+and+Hove+BN1+1,+United+Kingdom&amp;ll=50.822475,-0.137436&amp;spn=0.007957,0.016522&amp;z=16) but I bet you will be able to buy discounted ones from Campus somewhere.

Lewes is a very pretty town nearby. Can get there on a bus or train and is worth a trip. If you haven't been, you'll have to visit London at some stage. It takes about 50 minutes on the train and you get get a return ticket for about £10 off peak.

There are loads and loads of pubs/bars in the centre of town. It depends what you're looking for.

Vodafone, T-Mobile and Orange are all good for reception. The cheapest cell phone provider is Three but the reception can be a bit dodgy. You can get pay as you go sims from Tesco (a supermarket) for 99p that give you something like £30 of credit for every £10 you top up so you'd just need a handset and you'd be good to go.

Cheapest and most convenient flights to Amsterdam are from Gatwick airport via easyjet. It takes about 30 minutes on a train or in a taxi to get to the airport. Just had a quick look and return leaving on Wed 26th Jan returning on Mon 31st Jan are £54.98 per person which is a complete bargain.

Hope you get some more answers and have a lovely time here!

London Road area is probably where your dollar will go the furthest without having to spend too much on rent, still be be central and not far from university.

2) The bus system in Brighton is good, but ridiculously expensive (£2 each way), the 25 goes from University to the City centre and therefore 5 minutes from the beach. Avoid the 25 bus @ rush hour, takes ages and its full of school kids and crying babies, the train from Sussex Uni (Falmer) to Brighton Station takes around 7 minutes, it is a good alternative. Student discount on bus and trains are available.

3) Lewes (less than 20 minutes by train) is a quaint, old town with cobbled street, a castle and sweet tea shops. London needs no introduction (55-75 minutes).

4) Best pre-pay is Three. if you top-up you get 300 minutes, 500mb internet and 3,000 texts. http://www.three.co.uk/Pay_As_You_Go?intid=topnav. Their reception used to be pretty bad, now its one of the best. Bad reception in the UK is different to bad reception in the states, by bad reception, we mean *only* 3 bars of signal.

5) Amsterdam go by EasyJet, avoid Ryanair at all costs.

6) Plenty of bars, Rikitiks: good ambience, independent, little bit pricey, Pav Tav: mixed crowd (Old, young, students, goths, indie, jocks, emos), good atmos, cheap, part of a chain, terrible food. All the pubs and bars in the Laines area are eclectic and mixed, the Laines and North Laine are cool places to hang out in the day, independent clothes, records, comics, thrift, food stores, not a chain store in sight. Clubs to check out: Audio, Digital, Concorde 2. Avoid: any clubs or bars on West Street on a Saturday night.


Groceries: Tesco and Asda are generally the cheapest places, Sainsbury's are reasonable but a little more expensive. Waitrose and M&amp;S are expensive but the quality of their food is very good, as a student you probably wont shop here too often.


Clothing: Topman and H&amp;M are popular, mid-market and up on the latest London trends, Primark are good for basics like cheap socks and underwear their clothing is fairly badly made and doesn't fit too well though, £4 jeans might be tempting on a student budget, but don't go there.

Not to mention that most of it reeks of studio interference.  The Master is truly horrible and Eric Roberts does the character no justice.

It's just not good.  The only redeeming quality is the new theme and the Jules Verne-esque TARDIS control room.

Public trasport is very good in Brighton and its surroundings... We have a bus company that has a monopoly on the bus services, but provides very frequent buses to most of the city. You can also get the train from Falmer to Brighton in about 15 minutes. In terms of a bus pass, you'd want a Brighton and Hove bus company one and you can get these at many places in town. They'll probably sell them at your uni, too. If not, go to the One Stop Travel Shop at the end of St James' Street.

Banks and mobile phone serbvice provider... Any bank really. My personal favourite is HSBC, just cos I've never had any issues with them.

I'm with vodafone (for mobile phone service) but I recommend either vodafone or o2, simply for coverage.

Someone else has already answered about travelling to Amsterdam, but it really is that easy. Brighton to Gatwick Airport takes 25 minutes by train. It's also dead cheap. You can fly budget airline like Easyjet, but I think it's quite cheap to fly by British Airways too!

Now... Pubs/bars! Brighton and Hove has many many. I think the figure is ""about 400"". My personal recommendations are:

Robin Hood (my local - make a post in this subreddit if you go and I'll come and say hi!) - a charity pub. Off Western Road.

The Hampton and the Windmill - two pubs in Upper North Street, both amazing.

Koba for cocktails - quite expensive but it's a nice place, on Western Road.

If you need any more recommendations let me know, and I'll be happy to be your guide for anything else if you want to PM me. Aside from that, my advice is AVOID WEST STREET LIKE THE PLAGUE.

I think the public should get a say in the changes to key state services, not a bunch of representatives with possible ideological motives.

buses are fine there is also a trian service from the falmer campus into Brighton and Hove Stations one-stop travel sell bus passes but you can buy monthly passes from a fair few convenience stores also

visit Lewes, and the villages North of brighton in sussex, very scenic and some nice pubs, stroll down the beachfront, pavillion is a must and the nearby brighton museum is also very good

Bars; I like dingier dirtier scale of bars and in this case i recommend; 3and 10 on St James Street, Northern Lights, little East Street and the bees mouth on western road, but basically Brighton has an incredible number of bars and pubs it's worth just going with the flow make sure you try Tuaca whilst you're here, it's a bit of a weird local tipple (It's from Tuscany, but Brighton has taken as it's own). If you like live music check out the concorde 2 and digital which both have mid size local touring bands and good crowds.

Vodafone is the best coverage in Brighton followed by o2, there is no branch of citi in Brighton but Loyds can be used

amsterdam; cheapest way is coach, you might find some organized trips from UNI.

above all just chill and go with the flow, Brighton is a friendly and interesting place even in it's worst bits and has some really unique characters and a vibrant party scene :)

Favorite: **Leela** - a nice cross between Eliza Doolittle and Sheena: Queen of the Jungle. Also has the advantage of starring in Robots of Death, one of the most entertaining Tom Baker stories.

Least Favorite: **Adric** - Well, just look at him. He's impossible to like.

Fav Runner-Up: **Romana II** - She's just adorable. I defy you not to fall in love with her in City of Death.

*New Series*

Favorite: **Rory** - I love his interactions with the Doctor. I love the fact that he doesn't freak out about the TARDIS being bigger on the inside. Also: Epic loyalty, in the most literal way in Big Bang.

Least Favorite: **Rose** - I dunno. I didn't hate watching her episodes, but I never really cared whether or not she was there. Plus there's the whole hamfisted love story with the Doctor. Just not a very interesting character.

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"More vocational degrees and bring back the culture of paid apprenticeships within firms. 

FTR I'm probably one of the last generations to remember proper apprenticeships ( I'm 38 ) I came straight out of school into a draughtsman apprenticeship, most of my school friends went into electrical, engineering, building, mechanical apprenticeships, then for some reason firms stopped doing them a couple of years later.  These apprenticeships also came with an attached HND course that you did a couple of days a week at a polytechnic, not a university. 

The generations after me ( when apprenticeships ended ) started to go to Uni to study crap like media, social arts, sports studies, philosophy, graphic design, music technology. In other words, completely fucking useless life skills. 

So now basically you have whole generations of kids with completely worthless degrees ( and they wonder why they can't get a job )  I have no idea why this happened, Thatcher had something to do with it, but I'm not entirely sure what? I think it's because she killed off a lot of heavy industry on the basis that we, as a country, would be better off financially if we started imported instead of exporting, a fundamental error of huge importance that has led us to where we are now. She basically killed off large industrial manufacturing in the UK in favour of a quick buck. ( the more I write this, the more I'm thinking about what a stupid cunt she actually was. Killing off the UK as a world leader in industry for a quick profit...  I'm pretty sure our new conservative government are hell bent on finishing the job too, to be honest. It seems that way to me. ) 

So IMO we need to revert back to an apprenticeship culture, although... it's probably far too late.

true,elcarnicero,null,null,"I was born and educated in Scotland so my experiences probably won't map entirely onto the English system, but I'll give it a go.

My undergraduate degree was free. Before each of the four years I applied to SAAS who then paid my tuition fees to the university. I took out a small loan through the Student Loans Company, which I am now paying back through my paycheck. I was due to pay a Graduate Endowment of ~£2000 upon my graduation (IIRC, either paid outright or added to the balance of my student loan), but this was scrapped by the SNP in a blatant (and successful) attempt to buy the votes of students. I would have been perfectly happy (Okay, maybe not *perfectly* happy) to have paid the GE, as this was to be used to fund the system of student bursaries and partly cover the cost of paying tuition fees.

I did have to pay in the region of £1500 up-front to study for a Masters, but the rest of the cost (~£3000) was subsidised by the university itself. I'm not sure how that worked exactly - I believe it varies from university to university.

I was incredibly lucky to have come away from university with comparatively little debt, but I don't believe that the system currently in place in Scotland is sustainable in the long-term.

There are aspects of the Scottish system that I believe are worth carrying over to England - subsidised tuition fees and the deferment of loan repayments being the main ones - however in order to do this, I think the number of people going to university would have to be reduced.

On the whole, I agree with the arguments set out by the NUS et al, but the calls to return to the funding system of 30 years ago (These Cabinet Ministers got free degrees - why do I have to pay, hypocrisy, etc) tend to unravel when one considers the huge increase in the percentage of school-leavers attending university since then.

I loved Tom Baker's Doctor, partially because I grew up with him, but when I go back to the series I find I like his manic energy, his comedy, and his ability to go from wisecracker to serious life-in-danger mode in seconds. 

Jon Pertwee treated the Doctor as a cross between a mad scientist and James Bond, William Hartnell was a grouchy old man who outwitted his opponents, Patrick Troughton's Doctor played the clown, getting people to underestimate him...you get the idea. 

The classic Doctor Who stories are admittedly low budget, but part of the fun is seeing how the writers worked around it. They came up with some of the most inventive ways to show an alien planet without actually showing the planet. They also used the BBC's expertise in producing period dramas to put on some incredible sci-fi shows. My personal list of classic Doctor Who episodes to start with are: 

Tom Baker:
The Ark in Space
The Deadly Assassin
Pyramids of Mars
Talons of Weng-Chiang

Patrick Troughton:
Tombs of the Cybermen

Peter Davison:
Frontios

I think the 2005 revival, on the whole, stacks up pretty well. I personally loved the first two seasons, and I think some weaknesses in Russell T. Davies' approach were magnified in seasons 3 and 4 before becoming glaringly obvious in season 4.5 (treating advanced science like magic, focusing on character development at the expense of plot, inconsistent characterization, in case you were curious about my opinions.) Still, I liked it. 

Stephen Moffat's Doctor has a different tone than Davies'. It's a bit more old-school and may actually take me another season to get really used to it. Still, I don't think you'll be disappointed. In fact, I would advise starting at season one of the 2005 reboot with the Ninth Doctor. The first episode, ""Rose,"" is a great introduction to the series, and while I think David Tennant played a better Doctor, Christopher Eccleston will grow on you over time.

However, the problem then is what do you do with all the newly unemployed people? At the moment the universities are just acting as a convenient buffer to relieve the unemployment figures - everyone goes because there are so few careers available now, sure you might be able to work at ASDA with a few GCSEs or A-levels, but no-one wants to do that for the rest of their life.

See really, this is all just a symptom of a much deeper problem: the crisis of unemployment caused by the increasing efficiency of society (as a 10% population growth doesn't require 10% more services (especially in cities)), outsourcing and automation.

This hidden crisis is the cause of many problems we see now, the problem of ""paper mill"" universities you mention, but the aging population problem too, isn't really a problem of having enough young workers, as we still have many unemployed, but is instead a problem of failing to raise enough tax revenue, largely due to the unemployment concentrating wealth and slowing spending in the economy.

Einstein wrote in [Thoughts On The World Economic Crisis](http://www.marxistoutlook.com/article19.htm) that he thought the Great Depression was caused by just this problem. And we can certainly see it now, as the inequality grows until the purchasing power of the masses drops to the point that demand slows and many businesses become unprofitable, leading to redundancies and so a greater drop in purchasing power, eventually cascading in to a huge recession.

* Doctor Who Monthly comics, reissued by Panini Books in about a dozen phonebook-sized volumes
* Virgin Publishing's New and Missing Adventures novels - 61 NAs, 33 (or 34, depending on if you count *Who Killed Kennedy*) MAs.
* Virgin Publishing's Decalog short story collections - only the first four volumes are Doctor Who fiction, though.
* BBC Books' Eighth Doctor Adventures and Past Doctor Adventures (73 EDAs, 75 PDAs).
* BBC Books' Short Trips short story collections - 3 volumes.
* Telos Publishing's Novellas - 15 of them
* Big Finish Productions' main range of Doctor Who audio dramas - This month's is number 141.  They've been going since 1999.
* BF's Eighth Doctor &amp; Lucie stories for BBC7 - Now in their fourth series, which will finish up in March.
* BF's various Doctor Who spinoffs - Sarah Jane Smith, Dalek Empire, Cyberman, The Companion Chronicles, The Adventures of Jago and Lightfoot, UNIT, Bernice Summerfield, and I, Davros.  Put together, there's about as much spinoff material as there is monthly series material.
* BF's Short Trips short story collections - 29 volumes.
* IDW's comics - Doctor Who Classics isn't original material, but it is the best visual presentation of the DWM comic strips.  Agent Provocateur, The Forgotten, Through Time and Space, Fugitive, and the newly released Tesseract are all original stories.
* BBC &amp; Random House's single volume graphic novel, The Only Good Dalek.
* BBC Books' New Series Adventures - 42 books so far, and no sign of stopping any time soon.
* BBC Audio's New Series Audiobooks - 10 of these.  Note that they are exclusive to audio, and are not adaptations of existing books published elsewhere.

There's really no such thing as a dry spell when it comes to Doctor Who fiction.

Each regeneration is like opening a fantastic gift - every one of them carries the show in their own way, and every one of them is great IMO.

I've been getting the impression that people who even use the words ""the old show"" don't know what they are talking about.  Possibly, it is because they don't want to do the work to find out the order of things or whatnot, but there is no writer on the new series that would disregard anything that happened in the past with Doctor Who.  Steven Moffet watched and read Doctor Who since his earliest memories.

As Whovian elitist as it sounds, the second most common misconception after ""the old series is old"" is ""The Fourth Doctor is the best."".  Very few longtime fans of the show would say that - other than to confess a bias if Tom Baker was the first Doctor they watched regularly.  

The Third often rises to the top as a favorite among fans who have a large video collection or have been watching for 40 + years.  The Fourth Doctor played the character for the longest span, and is a significantly different character depending on which season you watch (was on screen long enough to change - the 4th with Sarah Jane is worlds apart from the 4th with Leela, or Romana).

This was true for Hartnell and Troughton and most of Pertwee.  During Pertwee's exile on Earth he eventually fixed the directional control (even hardwiring in coordinates sometimes in the programmer), and after that Baker demonstrated he was capable of (mostly) precision landings, but for a while he installed a Randomizer on the console so even he didn't know where he was going.

Pertwee made one very interesting statement at the end of his tenure in Planet of the Spiders.  He says that although he puts the space-time coordinates of the planet he's going to into the TARDIS, he lets the TARDIS decide the precise landing site.  In this way, he miraculously appears very near Sarah Jane Smith when he needs to find her.

Thus, it seems likely, given that we know the TARDIS is alive and communicates telepathically, that it can ""home in"" on companions or other interesting phenomena for the Doctor.  So it's that TARDIS that ensures the Doctor is always one step away from the next adventure.

True, but to be fair the team he inherited came 7th in the league just before he took over. At the rate he is going, he could easily come 7th or better I feel. While that is nowhere near the level I would expect from Liverpool, it's not doing much worse that what he inherited to be fair.

We have to look at it objectively. Football is a long term sport. Roy came into Liverpool to a squad that in a lot of cases spoke Spanish. A backroom staff that spoke Spanish. The players weren't his choice, and he had to do his best.

I'd do almost anything to see Liverpool back top in the league where they belong, but throwing Roy to the wolves out of frustration is just like throwing your toys out of the pram. Unfortunately it might take a couple of years for Roy to find his feet (just like Ferguson) but I'm resigned to the fact he'll be gone well before he gets that chance, and the whole circus starts again.

Even if we got in Hiddink or whoever, they might win a load of games, we come second or third, and then they leave. What has that done for us? The point I'm trying to make is that I feel that Roy is the man to build Liverpool up again, keeping the stars and shaping the rest. That won't happen over the space of 10 or 15 games.

    Come senators, congressmen
    Please heed the call
    Don't stand in the doorway
    Don't block up the hall
    For he that gets hurt
    Will be he who has stalled
    There's a battle outside raging.
    It'll soon shake your windows
    And rattle your walls
    For the times they are a-changin'.

    Come mothers and fathers
    Throughout the land
    And don't criticize
    What you can't understand
    Your sons and your daughters
    Are beyond your command
    Your old road is rapidly ageing.
    Please get out of the new one
    If you can't lend your hand
    For the times they are a-changin'.

It's nearly 50 years ago that Dylan wrote those lyrics.  Funny how some things never change.  Will we one day be the old guard that the new generation are trying to displace?  Will we be so stuck in our ways that the youngsters laugh at our ineptitude?  I hope not.  But history perhaps says otherwise.

While that is nowhere near the level I would expect from Liverpool, it's not doing much worse that what he inherited to be fair.

Last season was a blip as far as I am concerned. Gerrard and Nando injured for large parts of the season along with a raft of other injuries, beach ball incidents and all the rest of it. If it could have gone wrong last year it did. There's no way our squad is mid table. We should be challenging for 4th. At the rate we are going we will amass 40 odd points, which coincidentally, Fulham finished with 46 last year. We finished 7th with 63, a mere 7 points off 4th, despite all the shitty luck we had and the off field nonsense.

&gt;We have to look at it objectively. Football is a long term sport. Roy came into Liverpool to a squad that in a lot of cases spoke Spanish. A backroom staff that spoke Spanish. The players weren't his choice, and he had to do his best.

I don't think the language barrier is an issue, Roy speaks 5 languages and I'm fairly sure they all speak English. Also quality managers will take what players they have available and get the best out of them, Roy has not gotten the best out of any player, except maybe Lucas.

&gt;Even if we got in Hiddink or whoever, they might win a load of games, we come second or third, and then they leave. What has that done for us? The point I'm trying to make is that I feel that Roy is the man to build Liverpool up again, keeping the stars and shaping the rest. That won't happen over the space of 10 or 15 games.

I agree on that point, I don't want to see a Hiddink or whoever. I agree we need stability and a long term manager. I would like to see a young, intelligent manager with the ability to scientifically and statistically manage the players in the way the modern game demands. Most of all I want someone with a strong vision and clear ideas on how to move us forward. People like Dimatteo, Villas-Boas, Sanchez flores, I'm not saying them specifically, but someone of that ilk.

The thing I don't understand about the people asking to give Roy time is, time to do what exactly? What's his vision for the club? How does he intend to move us forward?

Doctor Who started as a episodic series - it is an old tradition, and may seem antiquated to people accustomed to modern commercial television, but it is far from invalid or lacking in quality because of it.

Invasion of the Dinosaurs was great for it's time - and is still good today (esp. for younger viewers, the general demographic for the series).  The eco-terrorism storyline is actually right in keeping with a modern audience (while, granted, the effects seem poor by today's standards - as do almost all dinosaur effects predating Jurassic Park).  From my perspective, it's a Third Doctor and Sarah Jane story - you don't get a heck of a lot better than that!   

Maybe you'd enjoy the older stories more if you spaced them out more - after all, originally they were intended to be spread out over a week or more.  Or, more likely, once you've exhausted all the new shows and want to really get into the history of the show.

In the newer episodes, he usually chooses to go somewhere specific, because he wants to show his companion an interesting point in time/space, or because it's a fun place for holiday, or something like that.  Occasionally in the new series, and much more frequently in the classic series, he would wind up in places on a fairly random basis, for one reason or another.  In some of the very earliest episodes, it was a given that some combination of the TARDIS being old and dilapidated, and the Doctor not being an expert pilot, meant that he often showed up in some random location.  As the show progressed, they lessened the random factor and had more stories where the Doctor picked his destination, but there would be times when he went somewhere in response to a distress call, or because something was out of whack, or whatever.

The ""randomiser"" bit was during the Key of Time sequence... there was a set of episodes during the 4th Doctor's run where he and Romana were tracking down the pieces of a powerful artifact called the ""Key of Time"" and - to avoid being tracked down by the Black Guardian - the Doctor intentionally installed a randomiser into the TARDIS controls to add a random element to their travels.

Surely it cannot be right that someone's financial situation should dictate whether they have access to legal recourse... it should be easy enough to determine whether someone has a valid case or not before massive costs are incurred and, if they do have a valid case it would seem improper not to allow it to proceed on the basis of cost..

&gt;Legal aid will be cut for a wide range of civil cases, including:

&gt;    * Divorce, welfare benefits and school exclusion appeals

So, sweeping cuts and reform within the welfare system coupled with a removal of a redress mechanism...

&gt;    * Employment

Increases in unemployment and cost cutting in the private and public sector and at the same time we make it harder for the poorest to seek redress against those that abuse them in work?

&gt;    * Immigration where the person is not detained

Again, attempting to couple changes in the immigration system with a less accessible legal route to challenging them..

&gt;   * Clinical negligence and personal injury

I would have thought that both of these constitute areas where life was at stake.. Or in the very least an area where the poorest need to ensure that they have some redress..

Now all of that may not be so bad if the alternative methods discussed (including mediation) are open, accessible and fair, but again it would seem to make more sense to leave the possibility of civil action available with other courses being required before moving forward..

&gt;Mr Clarke said taken together, the reforms were a move towards a ""simpler justice system"".

A simple system is indeed a good aim, as long as it doesn't override the core aim of providing a justice system that gives people access to justice..

&gt;Law Society chief executive Des Hudson warned the government against ""playing fast and loose with the basic principle that the courts and justice system are available irrespective of your wealth"".

This is probably the position I would take, this isn't an area where you can mess about and see what money you can save. It is an area that is absolutely fundamental and not one to be played with for political gain.

""Mr Clarke said..[that] the best way for people of limited means to access justice in areas such as medical negligence would be to use of no-win, no-fee lawyers. ""

So essentially we move protecting the poorest into what amounts to the private, for profit sector... That seems in line with other policies, but I am not sure it's what we want to see...

&gt;Our correspondent predicted there would be ""complete outrage"" from within the legal profession and agencies which help families - but the government's point of view was that it was time to make big decisions about priorities.

So, poor people and access to the legal system appear to be lower on the list of priorities than one might expect..",0,1289852829,null,0,false,0,c15p5ev,t3_e6hlz,t1_c15p5ev,t3_e6hlz,null,1426574250,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

The set `A` is defined as infinite if there exists a strict subset of `A` which has the same cardinality as `A`. A strict subset is a subset which does not contain all elements of the set it is a part of (all positive even numbers is a strict subset of the natural numbers). Having the same cardinality means each element of one set can be matched with a unique element of the other set.

If a surface is continuous, there are infinite points on it meaning that a small part of the surface can be taken which has the same amount of points. Because the points on the original surface can be matched up one-to-one with the points on the surface that was removed, the part that was removed has enough points to make up a new surface identical to the first one.

An easier version of this is to look at the natural numbers, or the counting numbers. That is the set `{1,2,3,...}`. It can be split up into even and odd numbers, leaving us with `{1,3,5,...}` and `{2,4,6,...}`. If the even numbers are all put through the function `F_even(x) = x/2` we get back the set `{1,2,3,...}` putting the off numbers through a function `F_odd(x) = (x+1)/2` also gets us the same set `{1,2,3,...}` leaving us with two sets as big as the original set even though both were made from strict, mutually exclusive subsets.",0,1289862477,null,0,false,0,c15pw60,t3_e67ik,t1_c15pw60,t1_c15oitv,null,1426574612,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I laughed and then realized that he hadn't been seen in quite some time.   ""How long ago did you send him?""  I asked. 

The group suddenly got a look of panic on their faces and called him via the store Intercom to come to the sales counter.   He had been there for over an hour.

true,Orbixx,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"No idea why you've been downvoted, your opinion is intelligently balanced.

I personally think a deterrent like this is inefficient. This proposition makes two ridiculous assumptions:

- Fat people don't have quite enough money to be able to afford eating more than they should, or the wrong stuff if we push the prices up with tax.
- Even if they do have enough money, they still won't buy it as often because it's too expensive.

The majority of fat people will absorb the increasing prices and continue to eat the same, for the most part.

It's not a problem of having too much money and not knowing what to do with it. Bad food tastes too damn good, has too many addictive properties, people have genetic or environmental issues that both make them intake more than they need, both at a food level and the level at which food is processed by the body.
