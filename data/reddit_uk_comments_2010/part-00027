That would make Tennant to Smith the Seventh regeneration (if 8 to 9 was indeed a regeneration and not a renewal). While it is generally accepted that those early renewals were the same thing, they were explained in their episodes, relatively thoroughly to be something different than the regenerations we have known of since Baker appeared. So, we could have six more doctors, if they all only regenerated from here on out, and still stick to the admittedly loose canon. Now, if we threw renewals BACK into the mix, we could continue indefinitely. 

Also, from wikipedia:

""The BBC's Series 4 FAQ  sggests that now the Time Lord social order has been destroyed, the Doctor may be able to circumvent the limit on regenerations; it says: ""Now that his people are gone, who knows? Time Lords used to have 13 lives.""""

true,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"&gt;I've not seen a compelling argument for why we can't do 'more with less' however, or why cutting science research even further will lead to a total collapse.

We can't do more with less because we are already running on a shoestring - there is no fat left on the beast, to cut further will simply destroy good science.

Already the current RAE system is already ridiculously streamlined and many very good proposals are rejected meanwhile I recall a letter in the Guardian by a Physics Professor at Lancaster who admitted that he had to reject several brilliant post-doctoral students as they simply didn't have the funding to offer them positions.

The reason it will lead to a total collapse is because science is continuously moving forward at an ever-increasing rate, it is a difficult task to keep up with developments in your field when you are working on it full time and is virtually impossible when you have to find a job in alternate career path for a few years due to funding cuts. So those that leave science are unlikely to return, meanwhile current students will see what happens to the current set of scientists and perhaps decide to apply their skills in the financial sector rather than risk taking a PhD.

Therefore we cannot simply drop science funding in bad times and increase it in good ones without having massive effects, and it isn't simply an 'efficiency drive' as science has never been particularly well funded in the UK (perhaps it was in Cold War era USA) and has been seriously low-budget since the Thatcher cuts let alone that the recent STFC debacle has damaged physics and astronomy funding even further.

I am personally more interested in applied sciences but it is clear that the time between blue-skies research and hard-nosed application is decreasing. Just look how rapid the development of Graphene has been when the methods of procuring it for experiments were only developed a decade ago. The act of 'combining and developing existing technologies' often also takes place in the physics and engineering laboratories of universities.

Cutting science by 25% will save a small amount of money (as the science budget isn't particularly generous anyway) but the cost will be immense and will be felt when the credit crunch is as distant a memory as the 'winter of discontent'.

I've heard a very different perspective on science funding; one of my colleagues has recently finished a PhD in materials science. His opinion was that Vince Cable was entirely right when he said universities could do more with less.

He explained to me that despite constant attempts to reform the academic investment system that funding did not go to 'good ideas', but 'big personalities'. That he'd seen professors endlessly gaming the system for the sake of personal empire building; demanding equipment they had little need for against the high costs, pursuing projects that were clearly never going to lead any ware useful just to appear busy to justify next years resources.

At worse, he called it a 'public subsidy of peoples hobbies'. He was a bit disappointed to find research in the private sector little different...

I do understand your pain though. I work in the defence industry, and with 20% cuts we're probably looking at between 30'000-40'000 engineers and scientists about to loose their jobs. R&amp;T spending is about 1.2% of the defence budget; a paltry amount and utterly pathetic given the current strength of UK defence exports. An industry body [recently recommended](http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=4769512&amp;amp;c=POL&amp;amp;s=TOP) this spend be doubled if the government wanted to maintain the market, but frankly I think that very unlikely.

But one argument that's been made very well through the debate around what to cut from the defence budget could also apply to scientific research; namely 'we can't do everything'.

Blame it on bankers, the unemployed, the rising cost of state pensions, or whatever. We simply don't have the money to do what we did any more.

The sensible thing to do in this situation is not to make salami-slice cuts, but to establish a long-term strategy for what key fields we want to develop, what we think could lead to the most useful advances or support future industries. Then we make policies and direct funding accordingly.

Obviously no one has a crystal ball and such policies can very easily go wrong (see the current state of our electronics/nuclear industries), but what is the alternative?

Seriously, yes science funding cuts will cost the UK economy but at the same time I think I can chime in on this one.

In the past 5 years I've done 8 calls for what's called applied research, 2 calls for exploratory research. All under science budgets from different departments ranging from DEFRA to the MoD.

They're all scored based on bizarre metrics, nothing to do with stuff like, ""We need someone to come up with a clean energy source that can replace coal"" but more, ""We need to know the social impact in terms of diversity on your project - 5 points are awarded for this.""

There could be other ways to play with the idea though... they have already established the idea of parallel universes where people are different - Rose was a dog in that one episode. So they could have a female Doctor from one of those. I also think they missed a trick in that Christmas special where David Morrisey was a future version of The Doctor (kind of.)

Since 1994, the character has also appeared in various novels from Virgin Publishing and BBC Books, set between televised adventures during his particular era of the programme. One BBC Books novel, The Face of the Enemy by David A. McIntee (1998), picks up the story of Ian and Barbara, now married to each other, in the early 1970s, the two of them collaborating with the Doctor's colleagues at UNIT and his enemy the Master when Ian is hired as the Third Doctor's temporary replacement while the Doctor is taking a trip away from Earth. In this book, they have a young son named John. Many of the novels mention a 1980s pop star named Johnny Chester or Johnny Chess, intended to be the same character.

true,5celery,tardis,TARDIS,"This is a complicated subject.  Also one I haven't seen addressed as much as I thought I would here, on this subreddit.

There are hundreds of novels.  
There are around a hundred Big Finish Audios by now. 
There are also at least a hundred comics.

The novel ranges are varied, and not without complexities.  

There is the New Adventures range - which was the life raft for fans after the cancellation in '89.  

There is the Missing Adventures range - which are original novels featuring Doctors earlier than 7 (plus a couple of 7's and one 8).  

There are the Eighth Doctor books (73 of them) - these were the new new adventures, serving as the fan liferaft after the '96 TV movie.

There are the Past Doctor Adventures - round about 70 of them as well (original novels featuring Doctors 1-8).

The Big Finish Audios have a diverging canon for the 8th Doctor, as do the comics.  The Eighth Doctor is just about impossible to categorize chronologically - but each branch is worth following (esp. the novels, IMO).

Big Finish also has a book line of Doctor Who novels - mostly short story anthologies on varying themes. 

There are also the New Series Adventures.

I'm a fan of a few of these branches - and can tell you that there is material in them that is just as good (or better) than anything ever filmed on any of the series.  Truly great fiction written by people who love DW and are also at the top of their game.

To pinpoint what is best is difficult.  Some sites have featured ratings that you can vote on (I used these ratings to help me choose books once upon a time).  There is some dreck as well.

As for whether they are considered canon:  Well, they are all licensed by the BBC - and usually presided over by strict editorial control.  I highly doubt whether they are much taken into consideration by Stephen Moffet, or RTD in his time, but as they are fans - there are nods, and occasional crossover (okay, sort of once... with Human Nature).

I was eager to see if The Doctor's Daughter would follow the story from Father Time (8th Doctor had a daughter, Miranda - she even had a bried spin-off comic book) - and was bummed when it didn't.  Father Time is pretty great, written by Lance Parkin - takes place on Earth in the 1980's (and has a Transformer in it).

Lance Parkin broke his back writing a book called Ahistory that does a mindbogglingly amazing job of sorting all of it.  Of course, unless a new edition is written - that chronology omits the new series.

You CAN consider most of it canon.  Much of the time, stories are written in such a way as to be considered stand-alones that won't make or break big continuity archs.  The books contain seasons, in a manner of speaking - a whole century of the 8th Doctor stranded on Earth with a broken memory and no functioning Tardis ran for 10 books.  There have been other archs - mostly in the books pertaining to whomever was the current Doctor at the time (while the show wasn't running).  

There are archs in the audios, too.
The audios contain some seriously great stories that it would be a shame to not consider canon - Spare Parts gives a Cybermen origin that actually [places The Doctor's genetic blueprint as a component of the Cyber Race!](/spoiler)

I've been thinking that there should be a /r/Doctor Who Novels - because there is seriously as much original fiction written as there ever were filmed stories - and a lot of it is deadly good.  Geedlords like me could try to point folks in the right direction when they are trying to navigate this glut of material.

Worth collecting - that's for sure - esp. since the vast majority of it is out of print and getting rarer as I type.  

Woe unto fans of the current series who haven't watched the older series (to me, this should go without saying), and unto fans of Doctor Who who haven't read at least a third of the books (the really good ones).  Some of it is ""hard fiction"", some of it is geared towards younger readers (new series adventures, while often well written, did take a step backwards in terms of the targeted consumer age), some of it (the Big Finish collections come to mind) is for uber die-hard fans (regularly citing minutia from 40 years ago and building something cool out of it).

&gt; DAI acted as a conduit for U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) (through the Office of Transition Initiatives) and National Endowment for Democracy  (NED} funds to the Venezuelan opposition to president Hugo Chavez. Furthermore, it was instrumental along with NED affiliated organizations for financing black propaganda on Venezuelan private network TV during the general strike in 2002. Documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act  request show that DAI was required to keep certain personnel in Venezuela and had to consult with USAID about staff changes.

I'm not making any claims about her but I do appreciate and accept your point on essentially not speaking ill of the dead. 

&gt; she was not a bona fide (in your belief) aid worker

Your words suggest to me that you think that I'm questioning her own credentials; I'm not. She's not the one describing herself as an ""humanitarian aid worker"", it's our press who are copy/pasting it from government statements. 

Some of these statements which have recently been proven to be false e.g. the bomb vest story which carries with it major fundamentalist ideological baggage as opposed to your generic insurgency against a foreign aggressor. My beef is with our government for playing these propaganda games. They are the ones twisting this story to both play up the ""why we fight"" aspect as well as trying to cover up their own arses. Just take a look at their own words, it's a little disturbing the spin they are using here, particularly William Hauge's statement. 

&gt; [you imply] we should not care how she died

Actually I think we should care *more*. Was she at risk being placed with only an Afghan escort?

ISAF also pisses off the locals by coming into an area, fighting the Taliban, and then leaving which means the Taliban come back and hurt any locals they see as having helped ISAF forces (i.e. reporting where they are, telling ISAF soldiers about weapons caches, bomb making factory's etc). In the areas firmly under ISAF control, life is more stable and safer, and modernity is creeping in (which is popular), but at the front-lines the locals are basically caught between 2 sides who are fighting around them. The Taliban will force themselves into a village, and force the locals to give them food, shelter etc, then ISAF will come in at night to take them out and hurt them in the process. In the areas the Taliban controls, they enforce a very strict interpretation of various ""Islamic"" laws, which the locals don't like either.

Ultimately, the problem is that we can't compete internationally anymore. Foreign labour is cheaper (because of the terrible working conditions, etc.) and so we can't compete in manufacturing or agriculture really, meanwhile we aren't investing in science and technology as much as nations like Japan, South Korea, Germany and the US, so we are losing out there too.

Essentially, we can't produce what we need, and we have little to other the world.

Of course, we could use heavy government investment to automate menial work and create jobs in construction projects, research, etc. and then share the profits. Ultimately, we should use the money and power whilst we have it to set ourselves up for the future, rather than cutting investment and services, increasing unemployment and fading in to insignificance.

In order for that to change then there would have to be dramatically more flexible working hours in place, but this won't happen until people wanted it, which they don't. Hence the tube and buses don't run, because most people are in bed after midnight, and thus the usage drops off to the point where it is simply not cost effective to run these services.


As for more social clubs, this would require more people to volunteer to do this, as the groups that are most likely to want these type of things are also the least able to pay (which makes it less likely for private enterprise and start-ups to get the investment required to do run things like this as it isn't going to create a profit). This is fraught with problems like expensive insurance costs, rent, CRB checks and a general feeling that there is far to much red tape to cut through.

So, if you want to see more social clubs, you have to realize that they are not going to create paying jobs people can live off of, and you also need to find a way to deal with the red tape (and perceptions of red tape) in order to get the volunteers required to run it. You also have to decide how much council involvement you want, do you want them as an active partner, or do you just want them to provide a room in a community center for free? This is kinda a part of the Big Society idea, if you want a social club for the elderly, then get together with like minded people and set one up, don't rely in the state to do it for you.

Basically, this is the type of thing people used to do for each other, be it in pubs, social clubs or church halls.

How many people would vote lib dem, green or any other if this whole waisted vote thing was not an issue? X2 is not unlikly.

Our electoral system is completely non representative due to this whole 2 party mess.

At the very least AV will convince people to vote for who they really want.

Because of this the big parties Tory + Labour will not be able to ignore minority views. They will have to try and win you 2nd preference.

The bread and butter of the pub trade was the old bastards who sat in the pub *every* *single* *day* smoking cigarettes and drinking, or the builders and postmen who'd finish at four and spend the rest of the day watching football. In short it was the working classes, and on the whole the working class smoke.

I know your type. The type of wine drinker who'd come in every other saturday and have a couple of drinks before fucking off to some trendy club. They'd stand at the bar telling their work colleagues that they were a 'total regular, yah' without even knowing my name.

Your type was never enough to sustain the pub industry. You drove the working class outside so you could call it your own and in the process ruined it.

&gt; There we nowhere near enough non-smoking because land lords thought they had us by the balls.

You could have gone to the wine bars, the restaurants, the gastro-pubs – all these places were tailored to your fancy and they were all around long before the smoking ban.

&gt; The industry failed to solve the problem so had a solution imposed upon it by government.

What problem? The problem that you personally didnt like the smell of smoke?

How about all the people who wanted to smoke, or who didnt care? It's not the role of Government to force people out of business on the premise of moral finger-wagging.

&gt; Landlords don't have to be in the business if they don't like the conditions.

Right. Im calling you out on this, because you seem to think that being a pub landlord is just some kind of day job.

A friend of mine spent 17 years in the pub trade. He worked every day, never had any holiday, he literally put his life in to the little pub he had.

Then the ban came and my friend doesnt have a garden.

He has excellent beer, but it's an old mans pub  - and old men dont like standing out in the cold just to have a smoke.

So now my friend just watching his lifetimes savings just drain away on rent and bills. He doesnt make enough money to cover the upkeep of the place, and he cant sell the lease because no one will buy a pub with no garden.

And before you start some cretinous reply about aiming for a different market, h'd have to completely gut the place and have extensive renovations to have a chance at getting interest from the kind of wine sniffing bore that you clearly are.

He cant just 'walk away' and while Im sure that you wont understand why he cant, anybody whose ever built up their own business will.

Investment is needed, because we need to create proper private sector jobs. The private sector is where wealth is created, the public sector can only ever be a parasitic entity.

It'll be a slow process, but Britain needs to go back to its grass roots as 'a nation of shopkeepers' that creates both wealth and jobs.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I basically agree that we need to make private sector jobs and that just making more public sector jobs is a self consuming cycle.  But that leaves the question:  How do we make private sector jobs?  (Or rather how do we get the private sector to make jobs?)

To answer that we need to look at why the private sector is not hiring people at the moment.  There are 2 reasons:

Lack of demand for products

Expected continuing lack of demand

In short the private sector is not hiring because it does not need more people now, and it does not expect to need them in the next 6months/1yr/5yrs.

So if we want jobs we have to create demand now and in the future.

Creating demand now is easy.  Government must borrow and buy things from UK based private companies.  In my original post I suggested high speed trains and infrastructure and wind turbines and other renewables.  What we demand is irrelevant as long as we demand it AND there is a reasonable expectation of long term private demand.

So over the next 2 years government effectively creates these private industries in the UK.  That using means private companies and it means tax and spend.

That’s un sustainable (since taxes from these industries&lt;cost of operating them).  But that’s ok, because after 2 years, properly managed and regulated and encouraged, these companies should be world leaders in quality and price as well as capacity.  After 2 years, government quietly starts to back off, buying less and less (since our new rail and power systems are mostly finished).

Those companies now fill their order books from private orders, likely mostly foreign.  Government continues to tax them (at a reasonable level) and gradually the industry becomes totally self funding and produces an eventual ""tax-profit"" for the government as well as permanent, private sector jobs.

Its all pretty simple Keynsian stuff.

Now this is economics (invented to make astrologers look good as they say).  Very open to argument and discussion.  So I'll ask you:  Given I agree that we cant just invent public jobs, that we need *real, private sector* growth to provide jobs AND given that we are already providing very cheap capital, How are we going to get that unless it is by what I have suggested (large, short term government spending)?

Providing limitless investment cash has done nothing but keep bankers fat.  Its not working and we need something else.

But we have to look at the way things are, not how they could be.

The problem with the current maintenance loan system is that the loans are capped at a very small amount (it doesn't even cover accommodation) so a large parental contribution (or scholarship in my case) is still necessary to cover living costs. So even that isn't really fair.

As for the courses being different, I suppose it really depends on the subject. In something subjective like English or Politics then I suppose the identity of the professors would make a big difference, whereas in Maths and Physics - well they're called universal laws for a reason.

If you're looking into raising fees you're opening such a huge can of worms. Firstly, the contact hours. I get 8 hours a week on the lectures regarding my course and 3 to learn French. Most people get much less than this. Secondly, it's the fact that universities are seen as a place of research, if you are going to charge students all this money, they'll want it spent on them, not on people going to do ethnographic research on Belarus. In my university there was a scandal when a novelist with a salary of over 1 million pounds was employed to give lectures to Post grad students only (undergrads had to pay to attend), all this done to keep the uni's high profile. Give me a fucking break, I can only get basic textbooks for my course for 3 hours from the library but you're paying this guy that much money?

Just because we have to be realistic doesn't mean we shouldn't strive to a better system. All the government is doing is trying to cover the deficit with a chunk of society that people generally don't care about - so they can get away with it.

2) I am glad they dealt with it, but wish they had waited until the 13th Doctor was nearing his end.  It would have added better drama

3) It's not like they would have killed him off, so I don't know why everyone is so upset.   It was bound to happen.

4) For everyone crying foul and how they ruined continuity and raped your childhood, etc. etc.  There is still a lot of things that happened from the 8th to the 9th that we don't know about yet.   They may reveal things.  They may not, but it doesn't destroy continuity to say, some time between his 8th and 9th life, possibly during or after the Time War, the Doctor's regeneration limit ceased to become an issue. 

Since the Timelords can reset the Master's regen limit, it's possible the Doctor can now.   He hits his 13th life, does whatever plot devicey thing and restarts himself.  Limit intact, but still immortal. 

What about the TARDIS itself?  It used to power off the Eye of Harmony.  After the Time War, no Eye and the TARDIS powers up @ the Cardiff/Torchwood Rift.  Same difference.   Something fundamentally changed in the TARDIS, so why is it inconceivable that the Doctor didn't change too?   

Maybe Rassilon removed the limitation as a last ditch thing to curse the Doctor to live forever with the guilt of Locking Gallifrey in the Time War.

It may take 20 years, but I am sure they will deal with it.   In the mean time, sit back and enjoy it.

But, as seen in The Waters of Mars, the Doctor is *the last of the time lords*. There is no one around to say, ""Hey, wait, stop yourself at 13. You can't have more regenerations!"" He is the Last of the Time Lords, and he can do whatever the hell he damn well pleases. If 'giving myself more regenerations every time I am close to running out' is on that list, well, he's the LAST OF THE MOTHERFUCKING TIME LORDS.

What's the problem here? Maybe they hunted down time lords on their 13th regeneration and killed them. That certainly isn't a problem for him any more.

Though, one thing I would really love, is if they could keep the next Doctor secret when Smith's time is up.

Have him show up in the background or something, watching the Doctor.  Somewhere in a mid season episode, have Smith's doctor suffer an injury and regenerate right on screen into the new guy we thought was going to be a companion.

I'm not sure if they woudl split a season between Doctors, but it would be brilliant to have him show up incidentally in all these moments, perhaps even helping Smith's Doctor out of a few jams. When he regenerates, they spend an episode, seeing all the events from the new Doctor's perspective, and Smith fans get to see their Doctor for an episode or two longer as the new one goes back to watch himself and help himself get to that point.

Plus, every time the possibility of a new regeneration cycle seemed to come up, the Time Lords seem to control how it is handed out.

It's also possible they rescinded the limit for almost all timelords as a result of the Time War.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; In my original post I suggested high speed trains and infrastructure and wind turbines and other renewables.

Christ, I can't believe that Im agreeing with a self-confessed lefty but I do :)

The key here is infrastructure - which benefits everyone. Personally I wouldnt go for windfarms and renewables because I think it's too early for them to provide a realistic alternative. 

I'd go for Nuclear power and a robust program of road and rail renewal. Particularly rail, which has been neglected for too long despite offering a more cost effective transport solution than road freight.

In terms of stimulating British industry, I think we really need to start producing good engineers and technical specialists. Our previous Government placed a laudable but ultimately useless emphasis on stimulating the arts in this country. 

We dont need artists, we need innovators. And since we cant compete in the global 'who can work for the lowest wages' contest, we really need to be producing the kind of school leavers that companies would want to hire.

Finally, I think we should break up the banks. I actually hold a preference for the Austrian School of Economics, and I advocated simply letting the big banks collapse instead of bailing them out.

Instead of these monolithic megacorporations running our finance, we could have had a network of small local banks and cooperatives - and while these banks are unable to provide the kind of finance that a corporation might need, they are quite able to provide small loans for small businesses and families.

Ultimately, that's what's needed. It was a joke when Gordon Brown said 'British jobs for British people' because most companies in the UK are foreign owned.

FTR: I'm not just randomly talking out my arse here either, I used to run a club in the West End; because we never really had a dedicated smoking area our trade went completely tits up the three years following the ban, so much so that the Sat night ( once a regular 2000 people indie and comedy club that ran successfully for 10 years) is now closed permanently and the whole place is only being saved by its heavily subsidised student Fri night.  

This ban happened too fast, it was too brutal, no one in the trade or industry was even consulted and it has killed a lot of pubs and clubs stone dead. It needs a partial reverse or this industry could be on its last legs, it's as easy as that really.

With shows that have been around forever, you can change things. Star Trek has altered things. Star Wars has altered things. But if you're going to change something that's been woven into the canon of a show, you have to provide a workable in-universe explanation. If the writer treats this piece of canon (and it is a fairly important piece of canon) as unimportant, it brings up the unpleasant question of what else is considered unimportant, and from there the even more unpleasant question of why the story itself is important. 

A similar example is the introduction of midichlorians into the Star Wars canon.

""Pointing to Spain, where a smoking ban exempts small bars and restaurants, he said: ""The law has not been seen as a success and public dissatisfaction with the exemptions has resulted in the Spanish government proposing to extend the ban to all pubs and restaurants.""

=======


utter &amp; complete balls!, and that's easily provable by simply GOING to spain or germany and witnessing the healthy patronage of bar &amp; cafe. My local in Spain is positively thriving AND growing in fact! it not only functions as a well know bar and restaurant for everyone from celebrating students, works-outings, ex-pats &amp; holiday makers, but functions as a social hub for the local community, with kids running in and out all day and night to get sweets and bits and bobs for their parents, locals dropping in to chat and to watch football etc.

Not one bar has closed there except a couple of places run by stupid british people who foolishly throught they could ""buy a restaurant"" in Spain and make a living without any ability to cook or speak the language. All the other places in town are massively popular and most of them are growing in facilities &amp; upgrades. Our local had a huge outdoor covered patio area constructed to facilitate smokers and it's caused their business to increase.

In Germany, Dusselfdorf airport even has a contained smoking lounge INSIDE the airport departure lounge!!, and i can assure anyone, you go and visit Dusselfdorf airport and it makes our own much more 'major' airports look like absolute tatty, run down sh*tholes.. all steel, glass and polished marble and a guy sitting in the causeway area tinkling away at the ivories of a full-sized concert grand for the delight of the patrons.

Likewise, the Aldstadt drinking zone in Dusseldorf is flourishing and always heaving, with people able to choose as grown adults whether to go in a non-smoking bar, or a 'rauchclub' smoking bar; and i can tell you it doesnt reek of cigarettes outside in the street &amp; isn't littered with dog-ends like around any pub-zone in the UK.

isnt it funny, the germans allow a choice for smoking, yet DO take on the serious issues of car pollution for example, with strong laws about car emission levels allowed into central city and town zones

we on the other hand do the british thing of hammering smokers to the hilt while in reality every time our kids step outside they are exposed to massive toxic fumes from the endless stream of polluting heavy vehicles which infest our streets. Then at school we feed them on a budget that wouldnt pass muster in a 3rd world WHO refugee camp!!

Just take london for example.. we clamp down on cars &amp; smokers zealously, then fill the street with fleets of thousands of diesel-fume-belching old converted tourist-busses which drive around all day carrying virtualy no passengers. This is then augmented by further massive fleets of huge euro-tourist coaches driving into central areas and parking up willy-nilly, often running their engines while stationary.

Then add to that the total blanking of the Thames as a major part of London's transport infastructure in preference of buying yet MORE bloody busses!

we're so backward over here, and still essentialy practicing high-social moral imposition on people as if we were stuck in Victorian Britain.

We still see cannabis as some massive 'threat' to be driven underground into the waiting clutches of organised crime, while in Spain my 75 year old neighbour has LEGAL Ganja 'plantas' growing in his yard in paint-pots! - Go to the garden center and you see old dears walking around past large cardboard promotional displays for 2 types of 'Ganja feed' - one for leaf growth and one to promote bud-growth - nobody bats an eyelid!

In Germany you can have 'personal' and they only really are bothered about people driving stoned.

In Holland you can go to a licensed cannabis retail outlet, present your 'allowance card' and legaly buy good quality smoke which has decimated the street dealers and thus kept drugs out of the hands of youngsters.

Likewise we also still shove prostitution under the carpet with all the health and crime issues it then nourishes. Meanwhile in Germany, just up the road from one of our mate's farms in the country, there is a brothel, and again, nobody bats an eyelid - canyouy imageine the furore if a brothel opened in rural britain? lol - The Dutch &amp; Germans etc maintain health &amp; welfare for prostitutes, which drives down cases of sexual assaults and sex crimes and importantly IT YEILDS TAX REVENUE!!!

yUP... It's all spin and image with Britain

And the result of our puritanical drive to enforce these sham 'health &amp; moral' standards on people?

The worst public &amp; personal health of vitualy any developed nation

Massive child obesity &amp; educational problems

The worst under-age drinking problems of pretty much any developed nation

and the worst rates of teen pregnancies, crime, deliquency etc etc etc.

doesn't work does it!



Finally, on a lighter note; an old freind of mine (now sadly departed, NOT from his smoking I might add, but from old age) was walking in the streets of Manhattan smoking a cigar (as was his habit), when an aggressive women got in his face...Blocking his path in a confrontational manner, she pointed to his cigar &amp; shouted:

""You're polluting my air!!"" ....to which he calmly replied:

""Well madam, may i suggest you walk on the other side of the street!""

nobody's asking NON smokers to suffer smoke, as they always shriek and howl like crazed bloody lunatics whenever this subject rears it's head - we're simply saying it should be perfectly permissable for adults, given the legal right to marry, raise children, drive, vote and fight for their country.. to smoke.. in a seperate area!.. if they choose to!

would these non-smokers uphold the banning of eating meat in restaurants, bars and cafes because the 'veggies' decide on public health and morality?

true,yorlik,null,null,"It's only so productive to argue the powers of fictional beings, but there have been episodes where the Doctor was confused by illusions or was in the presence of The Master and didn't realise it.  In ""Destiny of the Daleks"", he and Romana meet the Movellans and neither one of them even realises that they are dealing with androids at first.  In ""The Brain of Morbius"" and ""The Deadly Assassin"" and ""The Pyramids of Mars"", he has a telepathic fights which he wins, but he is drained and has to really fight for his victory.

There is no indication that such disguises or ""psychokinetic energy"" would even begin to work on a Vorlon.  Kosh would not be tricked by a glued-on beard and mustache, or by androids with convincing rubber skin.  (His encounter suit doesn't even have eyes.)  At no point in any story does a Shadow or a telepath constitute any serious telepathic challenge to a Vorlon.  OTOH, there was a situation in which a Vorlon cast a separate illusion to hundreds of observers at the same time, so that each person saw something slightly different.  That's a level of telepathic bamboozling far beyond anything which we've seen in ""Doctor Who"", and yet even the much simpler deceptions have worked on the Doctor in more than one story.

Physically, the Doctor is clearly as limited as any being with a body would be: he has been forced to regenerate by things such as gunshots and falling from a great height; neither of those would be of the least interest to a Vorlon.  The Doctor has been manhandled, locked in cages, tied up, and handcuffed -- none of which would constitute any impediment whatever to a Vorlon.  Contrary your comment about taking a spacing, in ""Voyage of the Damned"", the Doctor is on a spaceship and the TARDIS is outside floating in space, and he can't get there because it would require going out into the vacuum of space to get to the TARDIS, and he can't get there.  (Peter Davison does it in one story, but it's just a few feet; at a few hundred meters, it's too far.)  The Doctor claims that he can hold his breath longer than humans and is more resistant to radiation than humans, but he has to take radiation drugs in ""Destiny of the Daleks"".

Think about all the times the Doctor has to run, or hide, or dodge, to save his life.  To a Vorlon, who can fly, pass through solid objects, and take the full output of a fusion reactor without harm, none of those things the Doctor has to flee is even the beginning of a threat.

The Doctor is very wisely NOT Superman, because if he was the stories would be boring.

true,mpierre,tardis,TARDIS,"&gt; The Doctor goes against Hari Seldon though

Definitely... Hari Seldon does small minute changes to history on a large scale.

The Doctor does large obvious changes in a single point in time to change history on small and large scale.

They would make incredible enemies, especially if the Doctor meets Hari Seldon near the end of his life and doesn't realize the existence of the second Foundation.

You could have a full season with different planets, different characters, in which the Doctor tries to keep the various star systems independent, solving the local crisis instead of using them to the Fondation's advantage.

Then, in the second, unseen by the Doctor is the second Fondation.

We've seen in the 9th Doctor's run with  Station 5 that the Doctor applies a fix and never comes back to check if the fix stuck.

Everything he was doing in the Fondation season could be undone by the long term planning of the Second Fondation.

At first, they are reacting. Slowly, like they did with the mule, they are provoking a series crisis which will either :

1 ) Benefit them in the long term if the Doctor doesn't come

2 ) Help them defeat the Doctor if he does come

Of course, sometimes he comes, sometimes he doesn't.

But every time he arrives in the 500 years after Hari Seldon, the future has changed and he is confused, causing him to learn to stick with that period.

He could even revisit Hari Seldon to boast about how he fixed one of the crisis not realizing that his mind is being read each time and they are able to react and undo his fix.

At some point, he begins to suspect that they have time travel capabilities because they are just too good, but in the finale, he understands that HE is the time traveler: they just use his brain for getting info.

As such, with his unhuman intellect, he feeds the 2nd second fondation in Hari's time with false info on the future and uses Hari's long term tricks to defeat them.",0,1287049591,null,0,false,0,c129nk5,t3_dqmwl,t1_c129nk5,t1_c128win,null,1426515528,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I was not suggesting that this was a good idea. Just that I think this is how they are thinking.

That said I will express an opinion. 

A couple of hundred years ago The UK invested a fortune helping America defend itself from the French and Spanish. Afterwards we decided to impose a small tax to recover our costs. I am sure you know how that turned out. 

I suggest we had much more to gain from that British dependency financially, even without taxation. Then we do from any current one. We are unable to tax their citizens and gain very little in trade. 

So maybe if they want us to remain the worlds 3rd biggest military spender. They should tax their citizens and use the money to fund a plane or 2 on one of these ships.

&gt; You need to leave the UK once in a while.

I lived in Saudia Arabia for two years, the Netherlands for a year, Turkey for two and a half years and have been back in the UK for the past 3, not to mention I've travelled around the world four times through various jobs, and had medical emergencies in Europe, the Middle East, Australia, India and Namibia. The only one that worried me was Namibia to be honest.

But I digress. The NHS consumes a stupid amount of money for what it provides. I don't have a low opinion of the NHS, I have a low opinion of the endless fiddling by [politicians and special interest groups](http://liberalconspiracy.org/2010/08/25/how-the-cancer-drug-fund-is-being-used-to-attack-the-nhs/), the [stupid targets](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article846957.ece), the buckets of cash being spent on [IT that doesn't work](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1542486/20bn-NHS-computer-system-doomed-to-fail.html) instead of frontline services, [the general waste](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/aug/04/nhs-websites-failing-patients) and the [poor bastards](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1320491/Failed-NHS-twice-Pensioner-loses-leg--life-British-hospital.html) that go in with one problem and come out with another (I apologize for the daily fail link on the last one btw).

Right now you go into his store, get his services for free and then give your money to his competitor - which means you will be the first one crying when all the shops are gone and you cannot get that level of service.

The point of this? Well non of the individual elements can ever be shut down, so it can't be stopped. This happens with all US military hardware across every State.

He started off reselling for a UK phone company (something to do with Hutchinson Telecom however my memory is sketchy) who then created a phone company called 'Orange' because this was new and they wanted to entice people in he managed to get a lot of discount and sold the shit out of these phones.

After having his fill of Orange he decided to open his own chain of phone shops, my dad opened shops in Northern England and his friend ran a few branches in Wales. 

They did very well up until about 2000/2001 when the likes of Carphone Warehouse started to appear and mass-market. My dad kept one shop open because it was turning a small profit and was similar to a hobby for him, all the time he still owned his garages (mechanic) and so slowly drifted back.

He closed the final shop some time in 2002 after it was broken into and had a lot of merchandise stolen.

I forgot to mention he did all this even though in the early 90s he was force declared bankrupt, he came out of it all smelling like roses with a tidy amount of money in his pocket. 

He left it all just as it became mass market and if he had stayed any longer he would have drowned, I believe the shops in Wales stayed open for a few years more as they were owned by my dads friend who was worth a lot of money and would not have felt the impact as much.

I agree with the first half of this comment but I dont understand the second half.  Why are they in a state of poverty?

I think that (for children) poverty should be defined as follows.  Maybe Im wrong about the specifics but I think these should be absolutes for living in the UK:

**Severe**
Lacks access to education

Lacks access to regular, sufficient food


Lacks access to healthcare





Inadequately housed (housing is cold, damp or more than 3 people to a room)




Clothes are worn to the point of no longer functioning (shoes that are not splash proof, coats that don’t keep you warm)


Cant afford a very minimal level of toys (balls/dolls, a bike etc, nothing new or electronic)







Struggles to raise money for essentials (school uniform including cheap sports kit, cheap birthday/Christmas presents)

**Moderate**

Cant afford non optional school trips (not skiing holidays but trips of an actual value)


Cant afford a cheap, pay as you go phone



No computer at home















































Only occasional holidays, always within the UK

**Not In Poverty**

Has electronics of its own including any games console



















Has (or shares with sibling) a TV in addition to a family one



Annual holidays abroad





More than 1 car in family (not including works vehicles)

As you can see from the list pretty much no child can be in severe poverty unless their parents are mismanging their funds.

That you are not poor on a hundred grand compared to someone on two-hundred does not mean that it is not relative.

I am fairly poor by England standards but not in a state of poverty. Still, I am aware of how comfortable my life is next to 90% of the world's population. Most of the time I feel like a millionaire but I can't really afford to go out and definitely can't afford a holiday. 

I realise this does not help much and we need to figure out what poverty is in our own environment.

The difficulty is that, as compelling as your list is, it is open to debate. How can you solidify an ""objective definition?"" I could easily nitpick at the details you provided. You could nitpick back and someone else would get stuck in and we'd all end up nitpicking like a bunch of philosophers endlessly debating something that has no answer. 

I am very perplexed about the idea of poverty. It's not something material. It's not just psychological either. I think part of a definition must include the health of the relationships with one's immediate community too. 

Interesting.

&gt; your attitude is just moronic. You complained to the manager that his goods cannot compete with a faceless online warehouse?

I don't see how that is moronc at all. Of course I did. Because his prices were so far off the actual value of the product he missed out on a sale. If this was an issue in my business then I would want to know.

I considered paying the extra just to get a tv there and then. I asked him if i could have it delivered tomorrow or the next day. He said nope. Can't be done. the 10 day delivery service cost £30 on all TVs. 10 days was the best he could do for any of the models I had looked at. Turns out their super giant shop has everything shipped from a warehouse.

true,drpressure,null,null,"&gt; I've recently felt quite uncomfortable watching one of my greatest heroes, the brilliantly vicious Charlie Brooker, become something of a TV celebrity himself, hosting shows and appearing as a guest on panel games. I remember many years ago Alexei Sayle saying that he didn't go to showbiz parties because he was worried that if he met Phil Collins and liked him it would be hard to put the boot into Collins in his stand-up act. I had this thought when I saw Brooker on C4's Big Fat Quiz and he shook hands with Peter Andre. For me, although I still find Brooker very funny, at that point some of my love for him died. OK, he may not have been supping with Satan, only touching Peter Andre, but he was now on the inside rather than the outside.

Went on vacation, got a call my order was cancelled because the old line was still active at the apartment i was moving to. Little did i know this was only the beginning of a two month struggle to get my phone line working. Got back from vacation and placed another move with BT, this time i knew the previous tenant at my new house had moved out. Again i get a call back, my order was cancelled etc. So i email my landlord to make sure the previous tenant cancelled her phone line. She did, and i even got her letter from Virgin saying the line was cancelled. Called BT, placed an order, same story about 10 times. The last times i told them, it is not going to work, you have to find out what is wrong, the line IS cancelled and it's your fucking line. One girl was kind enough to actually check why it wasn't working, you know they are actually not allowed to do this because of privacy blahblahbs. So, apparently the engineers got the order, they tried to connect my line, and it didn't work, they cancel the order. BT also told me, they can do a line ""takeover"" apparently this is complete bs too, they still get a cancelled order if the old line is active. So i call Virgin again, tell them it's not cancelled and can they please do it, i also ask the previous tenant to do the same. Two weeks later i get a second letter from Virgin saying they cancelled the line, from another date!!! So basically they sent out a letter pretending to cancel the line once, and wait and see if the customer changed her mind....

I would turn the low quality universities in to vocational schools, running courses with specific careers in mind, such that every part of higher education has a specified end-goal - rather than the current system that just churns out Media Studies graduates with no career prospects.

Of course, the government will never make these changes though.

true,YouLostTheGame,eng-GreaterLondon,Aberdream,"In a way, whilst I oppose the hike in tuition fees (tuition fees in general really), the target of 50% of young people going to university is severely detrimental. It has lead to the aforementioned fees, whilst dramatically reducing the value of a degree. What has a candidate got on others when competing for a job if everybody has a bachelors? 

Additionally, when you have a degree, people suddenly feel like they shouldn't be doing some sort of manual labour, such as a plumber. These people would still make good money, yet not have to go to university, leaving more white collar jobs for those who did, but maintaining a decent income for themselves. 

So having less people go to university is certainly a good move, but should be achieved by making kids realise that in order to be successful you don't need a degree and that there is a huge set of alternatives, not by rising the fees for everybody and saddling those who want to do law, medicine or any other serious subject saddled with debt for life.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well it depends which level you are looking at. The average for a PhD student is [about £13.6k](http://www.nerc.ac.uk/funding/available/postgrad/studentinfo/faqs/faqphd.asp), this is almost certainly less than you would expect to be making at the same age. Of course, if you look at established professors then the salaries are much higher, but there are very few professorships relatively speaking, it is arranged like a pyramid.

&gt;If they don't extend the maximum loan then there is a problem.

Which was Lord Browne's suggestion - no limit on the fees and a £7k limit on the government loans.

&gt;Really I lived in London on the maintenance loan and went out more than enough. The maintenance loan is only meant to cover the basics, food, basic accommodation, etc and IMO it's more than enough to do this.

Hmm, the London maintenance loan is higher than elsewhere though, and I don't get any of the further support based upon parental income and so I get the minimum in that regard. I get £3528.36 a year, so a parental contribution is really expected on that amount.

&gt;nobody is saying only rich people can go to university, just that once you leave you should pay back the costs.

That may be, in this area the maintenance loan is much more important than the tuition fees, as mentioned before, I think it is wrong that the maintenance loan expects a parental contribution.

As for the second point, I'd argue that we all benefit from having an educated workforce - since it is only in science and technology that we can compete internationally now. We haven't the land or climate for significant agriculture, nor do we have rare resources to mine, and our manufacturing can't compete with foreign sweatshops (nor should we wish to lower our living standards so), and as the recent financial crisis shows, we can't depend solely on the financial sector either.

Also, this situation just leads to the universities becoming paper mills as they are paid per student and so just want to pass as many as possible, meanwhile the government wants to ease the unemployment figures, and so people are forced in to debt as all careers soon require degrees.

&gt;[Citation needed]

Norway and Sweden both waive fees for students from the EU (even though Norway isn't in the EU). The University Of Trondheim for example, has a large international programme to attract the best students with the free education. Eventually the best students will have no choice but to leave the country and all the money spent on educating them to that point will have been to waste from the national point of view.

The underlying problem to all of this is that making money doesn't necessarily equate to providing something of value to society. And so they say it encourages people to only take worthwhile courses - but physics research is much worse paid than accountancy or working on stock market analysis, and so it will just force people to do what makes money (for example, potential physicists becoming quants) rather than what they wish to do, or what contributes the most back to society (consider the relative contribution of futures speculators and scientists, engineers and doctors).",0,1287258633,null,0,false,0,c12hnxm,t3_ds0yz,t1_c12hnxm,t1_c12hk0v,null,1426519313,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I'm sorry, but that's the stupidest idea I've ever heard.  I currently work at a university in a country where the government has a far bigger say in how the university is run that in the UK.  The result?  Chaos.  Government edicts change every year as to how undergraduates should be taught.  Colleagues here are currently having to deal with undergraduates on three differing types of degree, depending on the year they've started, with mutually incompatible course requirements.  If you really want to kill higher education in the UK, then let the government get involved.

Further, I cannot believe for a moment that anybody seriously believes vice chancellor paycheques are responsible for the current problems in funding.  The vice chancellor of Cambridge, for instance, takes home £230,000 in salary.  This is, in all likelihood, less than 0.1% of the university's annual spending.

(Of course, this begs the question of what fair renumeration for running a university should be.  I don't think £230,000 per annum is particularly exhorbitant.)

Sure.  We also benefit from all sorts of other things that we don't collectively have to pay for.  Let's face it, the overwhelming majority of students attend university for personal benefit.

Having recently left school, I can tell you that some of them, including the one that I went to, are just like university feeders -- it's all about preparing for university and being as attractive to universities as possible, rather than anything else, like, say, learning for your own educational benefit.

Alternatives to university are completely under represented in any kind of guidance as well.

Scientology merely insists that you should read the texts, and you should actually understand them, and make up your own mind based on your own understanding of these texts. 

Critics say you should not read scientology religious texts, and you should not make up your own mind based on anything else but their allegations and accusations. They set themselves up as priests of a sort, judges of what is right and wrong, what is true and false doctrine of the modern world.

There is indeed a fear of litigation among many companies with the result that their internal policies end up far exceeding the legal requirements. In other words it's not so much the Health and Safety Executive that's at fault as individual Health and Safety departments. Although these aren't part of the Executive, people have great difficulty distinguishing between the two. It's much the same case as exists with any piece of restrictive legislation, only in this case there's a particular government body which people direct their blame towards.

I didn't claim that, but it's the principle that there shouldn't be any incentives for running the universities as paper mills - ultimately the public won't support increasing the funding for universities if it just means the Vice-Chancellors get higher salaries.

You could not nationalise them and do them same things I suggest (cutting places, extending funding, etc) but then the universities still have an incentive to make the courses easier and take more international students - this constant conflict of interest isn't worthwhile in my opinion. The universities shouldn't be making profit on their education, since this will always lead to perverse incentives from the profit motive.

&gt;If you really want to kill higher education in the UK, then let the government get involved.

It doesn't seem like this will be necessary.
&gt;Whilst society may tangentially benefit, the real, tangible benefits belong to the graduates who command higher wages on average. Who pays for university should reflect this.

The problem with this attitude is that it encourages students to do what will make the most money (so they can pay the fees, etc.) rather than what they wish to do. And so potential physicists and mathematicians will become quants and investment managers, more students will choose to study business than science, etc.

The fundamental problem is that money earned isn't necessarily related to the benefit to society. The futures speculators earn far more than physics researchers for example (the average PhD student stipend is ~£13.5k) meanwhile the former gives almost nothing of benefit to society.

As [Albert Einstein said](http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/Einstein.htm):

Even in port this wouldn't happen. The port would be heavily defended.

Having said that, one nuclear ICBM I guess would work, but if a nuclear ICBM was fired then we have a problem not easily addressed by aircraft carriers anyway.

&gt; 300 of such missiles, you'd be guaranteed, but not in any serious environment.

The number would be probably less (although substantial), but would depend on whether it's primarily a sea - sea battle or an air - sea battle. It'd also take quite a while for a modern carrier to sink, especially with compartmentalised hulls. However the current strategy means that having a carrier in theatre provides a single target with which you could end or severely impair a conflict.

&gt; there's a reason why Soviet doctrine for fighting carrier groups didn't involve 1 missile, but actually involved the majority of their long range bomber force.

yes.


&gt;The number would be probably less (although substantial), but would depend on whether it's primarily a sea - sea battle or an air - sea battle. It'd also take quite a while for a modern carrier to sink, especially with compartmentalised hulls. However the current strategy means that having a carrier in theatre provides a single target with which you could end or severely impair a conflict.

well, yes and no. The cold-war strategy involved being able to detect the carrier group at &gt; 300 miles away - which makes targetting pretty hard, so the easiest option is to fire as many missiles as you can at the larger radar returns and hope. The US defence against it basically involved long range detection of the bombers, and F14's and missiles with 250m ranges, coupled with Aegis anti-air ships, standard sams and point defences. 

Another part of the reason for using long range bombers is that in any expected conflict, the carrier groups were expected to be anywhere from the US east coast to off the cost of norway, so to cover that range you need something that can fly for a long time.",0,1287314919,null,0,false,0,c12jf9v,t3_ds1ik,t1_c12jf9v,t1_c12j7ts,null,1426520134,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Aha, but we already have knowledge of what's needed. Things like the Technology Strategy Board exist to fund grants, and there are quangos working for DWP that determine which skills are in short supply. It's not continuous either. You use the DWP reports for long term employment requirements and match it up with the grant system. It's much more complicated than that but we do have the data (at least last time I looked and I can't be arsed looking for it right now).

Look [here](http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FactSheets/OperationsFactsheets/OperationsInAfghanistanBritishForces.htm) and look at how many RAF and Army units are deployed.

The RN does a fantastic job with logistics, but when you're looking at a spending review both the army and RAF have easily presentable cases for current ops. Having 40 commando on site doesn't justify two aircraft carriers no matter what Randy Andy says.

&gt; The RN is the ONLY force that operates on land, sea and in the air.

Not true. the reason the RN does this is because no-one wants to work with the fish heads ;)

I suppose the comprehension of what you are reading, and the ability to apply what you know IS an exceptional demand, no? 

Not like the average school with rote learning.

Look, most religions are based on stories, like the story of Jesus, the story of Moses, the story of Mohamed, the story of Buddha, etc. The core story is vital to the belief of these religions, and most other religions.

Scientology really is not about a set of stories. There is no particular doctrine as far as any set of stories goes. There are stories that pop up in various places in Scientology, but they really are not important, not in the way everyone imagines.  

The core teachings of Scientology are found in the basic books of Scientology. These are supplemented by full lecture series that were originally delivered at the time of the publication of the books, and which coordinate with the books. These are all fully available, and can be purchased by the public. 

Of course you seem to be insulted that dozens of books and hundreds of lectures are not shipped to you free of charge, like this is something that you are owed.

Here's a [free moral code](http://www.twth.org.uk/booklets/pdf/happiness_en.pdf) [PDF], which is more information than many Christians get out of the 4 gospels, and the ten commandments.

The book attempts to fill in a chunk of the Doctor's origins, written after but set prior to the TV movie. It works well if you consider the show to be cancelled and never again to be continued after the movie. With the 2005 series picking up the same continuity, the story is almost impossible to consider canon. It sheds a little too much light on the Doctor's early days on Gallifrey and casts him as a legendary figure of the same magnitude as Rassilon and Omega. You can read the entire book [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/ebooks/lungbarrow/index.shtml).

When you say 'Central London'... do you mean *central* London - what we would call Zone 1? The West End, The City et al? If so... no, you won't get a place for that sort of money. A better option would be to look at somewhere in zone 2/3 where you get a lot more for your money but you are still on all the tube and night bus routes. While useful, I wouldn't get too hung up about being close to a tube; I find it more useful to be close to a night bus route so you have a way to get home late at night. I find living south of the river a bit... well, I don't feel like I'm in London. You might think that's a good thing or a bad thing, however.

Some tips:

* Get an Oyster card ASAP for transport
* Get an umbrella
* Get Time Out and the Evening Standard on Thursday evening for event listings
* Sample real ale at least once.
* Riding buses is a great way to find out where everything is. Your zone 1-3 Oyster card allows you to travel on buses out to zone 5 (or further?), so its also a cheap way of getting further afield.

Places to visit:

* Camden is vibrant and full of gigs and wankers who'll sell you weed while stealing everything you own. Worth a visit, but make sure you keep your wallet safe! Most of the stuff on the market is shit, but its a colourful day out.

* Hoxton and bits of east London around Spitalfields are also colourful and full of wankers etc... the same warnings apply.

* Oxford street is good for shopping.

* Plenty of green spaces in London, so in spring/summer next year visit at least some of Kew Gardens, Hampstead Heath, Regents Park/London Zoo

I like the idea of one constituency, one representative, but the FPTP could be improved.

Sure, a coalition within the framework of the FPTP Westminster system.  A coalition in a PR system is a completely different beast, where, you know, get exactly what I described: power broking parties who enjoy a tiny majority of the vote yet control all the power.

Drink good local beer as much as you can

**FTFY**

Otherwise this is a great answer.  I moved to London when I was 25 and it was brilliant.  

Make the most of the travel opportunities.  Write a list of things you want to do, put it on the wall and plan them ahead.  Despite what I say about the beer, don't waste time on weekends with hangovers and lying about.  Book a cheap flight to Prague, Amsterdam, Barcelona or Edinburgh (or wherever...).  Stay in hostels, good way to meet people.  Got a free weekend?  Hire a car and go hiking in the peak district.

If you don't have a good appreciation of a really decent curry, London is a good place to start.  The curries can be simply amazing.

Not sure how you define 'Central London', I'd suggest getting a tube map and find a place in zone 2 within 5-10 mins walk of the tube station.  Then you can get in and out of any scene you want easily enough.  If you really want to party, you'll probably get best bang for your buck living close in east or south.   It's all about public transport though - it's faster to get home if you live close to a good tube line than if you live 15 mins walk from an irregular bus stop or train line.
Anywhere you live will have it's up's and down's.  My favourite place to live was around Hammersmith, but that's just me.  I'd think your budget is reasonably accurate, but I haven't looked at places rooms in shared accomodation for a while.  A few years ago, that would have got you a really great room somewhere.

&gt; all alone in a foreign city.

You're not all alone, you're a redditor :).  I'll be in London then, happy to go for a beer if you like, or have some kind of reddit meet up.
