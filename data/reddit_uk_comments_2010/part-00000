Somehow him getting to see her and the half doctor/half human combo having fun in the parallel universe would've done it for me, even if he didn't get to speak to her. You can't beat a forlorne look from Rose with the tardis disappearing noise.

I knew he was going but I just had this secret hope he wasn't going to. When he survived I just thought ""maybe... maybe..."" and then the knocking. Brilliant idea but just not worked properly.

The Doctor was almost insulting Wilf as he prepared himself to die, that's not the Doctor I love, he should've gotten in without telling Wilf what it meant and then spilt his guts about how he'd sacrificed himself.

The death was just kind of wrong. I mean it's great to see everyone one more time but it dragged the death out, like he could've gone someplace into the future and received medical attention or something.

""I don't wanna go"" was a great last line though. 

Anyone else not looking forward to the next series? The trailer makes it look super shit. Why bring back the aliens from Blink? That was arguably the finest episode since they brought it back and now they're going to piss all over it by using them again.

Edit: Who was the timelord lady that was helping behind the scenes? Was her instruction for Wilf to arm himself purely to shoot the diamond? Or was it for Wilf to take his own life at the end?

EDIT:

I haven't seen all the shows, not even the ones from this millennium. I'm relatively new to Who.

I'd only seen 'The Pirate Planet' because it was written by Douglas Adams and he's a funny muthafuckah but also dead so finding new stuff by him was getting hard. My friend from Wales told me about it and I knew it must be somewhere online because, well, EVERYTHING is online.

Then I discovered bittorrent and there was a HUGE (by dialup standards) torrent called 'fourth doctor' - that was where I learned I could download one episode of a series at a time - and I swear the first episodes I got had a Big Bad that was made of bubble-wrap spray-painted with green - and Tom Baker became the man I saw nearly every night just before going to sleep.

Look. I could have done worse.

Well, it was a serendipity kind of thing because then I learned there were new shows. New as in this century.

And the first episode I saw was 'The Empty Child.'

So it's Tom Baker and Tennant and Eccleston for me.

So far. 

I bet though, I just BET that there are people in this subreddit who can tell me the best, or at least most representative, episodes of each of the other Doctors.

Because frankly, it took me nearly two years to download the Baker shows and I really don't think I have it in me to watch all the others.

We *care* about not only the 9th and 10th Doctors but about his companions along the way and what is important is exactly what the Doctor tells the master: *Seeing* the universe in it's entirety is *owning* it, in your own personal way, and that is what makes Doctor Who as a show great. It's not about special effects, it's not perfect continuity, it's not even about clever plots. It's about *fun* and *adventure* and *freedom*. This show was never meant to be taken too seriously.

But last night's was so appropriately serious and intense that I want to jump out my window.

I started watching with the tenth doctor. His performance inspired me to go back and watch all of these latest series. Now I want to go back to the very beginning in the 60s and watch them all, no matter how crazy or crappy they are. I love the culture of this show, how it's the same character all throughout these years. That's so amazing to me.

This episode was great. It was kind of what to expect from Davies, and while he could be a little over the top at times (or all the time), seeing him talk about the show so happily and excitedly was always fun and he wrote some awesome shit. After seeing all the regenerations, I think this one is my favorite. It showed how regeneration isn't just a way to get another chance. It hurts on multiple levels. The fact that 10 went out with his last words being ""I don't want to go"" was completely heartbreaking. I was hoping that by the end he would be at peace with the fact he's dying, but he wasn't and it was painful as shit. MAN. 

I liked how he went around to everyone one last time to say goodbye, especially to whatsherface's granddaughter from Family of Blood. I wasn't expecting that at all. Interesting to see guilt still buried in him from that. I particularly liked him seeing Rose. That was depressing. He's at the end of his life and she's just truly starting hers. 

Also, I can't believe the four knocks turned out to be Wilf. I knew something would come about from that radiation thing, but I didn't think Davies would be able to restrain himself to the point of having the Doctor save, out of the entire universe, one old dude. That's so awesome.

true,jangleberry112,dalek,Dalek,"I just finished watching the 2nd half of the End of Time, and to be honest, I felt a bit disappointed. I LOVED that David Tennant's first words on the show where ""Barcelona!"" He started out as such a light-feeling, happy-go-lucky youthful doctor, but he had the same bit of bi-polar mania that Chris Eccleston's Doctor had. This whole ending to me just DRAGGED. The Time Lords' return being avoided by a single bullet? Remember what it took to get rid of the Daleks at the end of season one? Rose Tyler ABSORBING the TIME VORTEX. I mean, COME ON.

This whole ending left me feeling icky. Yes, David Tennant leaving the show was really sad for everybody. I just felt like the entire last 3 episodes they were harping on about how sad it was, and how the doctor didn't want to die. I'm just confused. When we changed from Eccleston to Tennant, it was no big deal and it wasn't like the Doctor was dying and going away forever and not coming back, he was just changing. Rose Tyler accepted the change pretty easily after the first episode of season 2.

The way this Doctor transition was set up, it felt like they were pressing the sadness of David Tennant's departure into the show and ignoring the fact that the Doctor's regeneration hasn't really been a big deal in the past. I thought Tennant's Doctor getting all emo at the end, moping about and saying goodbye would be more appropriate if the character was truly dying and not just regenerating. He still has all of the same memories, he is still essentially the same person, he just looks and acts a bit different. The trashing of the Tardis? Completely inappropriate. Watching Tennant's Doctor's regeneration felt like watching a young child having a temper tantrum. It didn't feel like a Time Lord's regeneration at all.

I'm going to stop now before I start repeating myself again, I just think they made WAY too big of a deal out of this regeneration.

You know, the one where a train with no brakes is barreling down a track and there are five workers on the track the train is currently on who will be killed, but you can switch the train onto a different track by flipping a lever, and the train will instead go down a track where there is one worker on the track who will be killed by the train.  Either way, the train will definitely kill anyone who is on the track, and there is no way to stop the train.  What do you do?  Flip the switch and kill the one guy, or do nothing and let the five guys die?

Davies sets up the Doctor with this kind of morality dilemma, and gives the audience a chance to see how the Doctor responds to a no win scenario.  A whole lot of folks hate these kinds of dilemmas, because it forces them to really assess who they are and what their own morals are, and so I can see why a lot of folks don't appreciate these stories.

Of course, I do love a good inspirational story where the hero solves the problem so that everyone is happy.  Win-win scenarios are nice, but rare...

Apparently you never saw 6 regenerating into 7.  Trust me...it was worse.


So what I can't figure out is why no one is commenting on the fact that he called the president RASSILON.  Thats pretty damn huge folks. 

My prediction:  A small handful of timelords will survive...to be precise, the small handful that came through the gate, including the president/Rassilon who will be the new ""Master""/Moriarty to the Doctor's Holmes.

How else will we find out who the 'weeping' woman was?  Or who the other was?  I mean why would they make a point of having only 2 vote against the final solution and just show the face of one?
Edit: Another thing.  That gauntlet that Timothy Dalton had?  Hand of Omega.  Has to be.  Especially since the Doctor named him as Rassilon.  There is NO WAY they'd show something as cool as the Hand and not tell anyone about it if they weren't planning on showing it again later...

And I betcha its a time lord (or several) playing with the Ood (since he said they were advancing too fast).

Anyways I do have to say that I really loved it. Sure just a bullet in the machine was a bit convenient, and a bit to easy... But all-in-all I'm okay with that because the rest of the episode was exactly what it needed to be. I feel like David Tennant was unique in how charming his visualization of The Doctor was. That is exactly how this episode ended, it was just completely charming. I thought the idea of The Doctor just waiting to die was fantastic, and watching his last desires as he new his time was up was captivating, and almost voyeuristic. It almost felt like it was so personal to him that I shouldn't be watching. I feel like this made his a truly original regeneration. His last words couldn't have been better chosen. 

RTD got a lot of flack for some of the things he did. Alot of it is probably justified. I have to say that he should get more credit for some of the other things he does. I absolutely love how he has been able to continually tie in characters from the past. I feel like this has made the new series much more cohesive and easier to fall in love with. All I could think in the last few minutes of the show was ""Go see Rose already dammit!"" I also felt like the simplicity of his last visit with rose was perfect.

I am completely excited for Steven Moffat. Clearly the best episodes since 2005 have been because of him. I really hope he is able to take everything that RTD was good at, and apply it to his own style. If he does that there is no reason that our new Doctor shouldn't be the best Doctor yet by default. I think the assumed darker style that he has will make for a refreshing new take on the show, and I think Smith will counterbalance this nicely. 

I welcome the Smith and Moffat, and love the next season already. I will miss Tennant, but Peter Davison has always been my doctor, so I don't know that I am as crushed as some people.

true,SpungoMcBungo,null,null,"Short answer: it hasn't been shown, you can make up your own story about what happened.


Long answer: There were plans to have the regeneration happen in the DWM comic ""The Flood"", but that was cancelled, I haven't read that comic so I can't comment as to what happens in it.


Most everyone assumes it was part of the Time War, and as such it's never going to be really resolved in the spin-off media (books and audios etc), I read an interview (can't remember where) which had RTD saying that part of the BBC charter meant that key plot elements in a Free to Air broadcast programme can't be revealed in spin-off media that people have to buy. So, even if the Time War in the 8th Doctor BBC books was going to be the same Time War as the RTD series, it isn't now; so it doesn't count unless you use your imagination.


Anyhoo... lots of terrible things happen to the 8th Doctor in both the books and the audios, but he always survives (but with amnesia, he gets amnesia a lot). There were hints in the books that things were going to get a lot worse, with his personal time-line being re-written and past companions being killed, but all of that petered out when the new tv series was announced.


The audio story ""Neverland"" has an end that kind of shows how an 8th Doctor final story would work, but it doesn't have a regeneration. 


Then there's that whole thing about there being three 9th Doctors...

- Pictures of the 9th at the Titanic bon voyage. 
- Pictures of the 9th at the eruption of Krakatoa.
- Pictures of the 9th at the JFK assassination.

These *could* have occurred after meeting Rose, and Rose could actually be at all of these events as there is plenty of room for extra adventures we didn't see as the audience, but I'm leaning toward these occurring *before* he met Rose. 

There's also this bit from the tie-in website for the 2005 premier:

&gt; A report on the contact Clive website shows that almost immediately after regenerating, the Doctor arrived at Totters Lane in the early 2000s, wearing his previous incarnation's clothes and muttering, ""They're all gone. I'm the only one left."" (WEB: whoisdoctorwho.co.uk) 

I'd like to think that the ***only*** reason we all assume it was *right before meeting Rose* is because of the ""Look at the ears!"" line and it's a lot easier to explain that away with *well, the Doctor is usually too busy jimmy jamming up timey wimey stuff to bother looking in a mirror all the time* or to simply say that Russel T. wasn't thinking about the inconsistency of the line and those photographs Rose sees in *Rose*.

Here's my take:

I like to think that the 8th, mortally wounded, barely escapes the time war into the time vortex. The TARDIS takes over as the 8th is dieing and goes to the first comfortable safe place it can think of: Totters Lane, 40 years after the 1st doctor landed there. 

The Doctor regenerates and wanders outside and starts to get his barings. He immediately remembers what happened and runs away from it. He doesn't want to face what he did, so he does what the 10th does at the end of Waters of Mars: Goes on holiday. 

So the 9th goes on some minor adventures, maybe only centered on Earth because Earth has always been the Doctors sort of hide away from the rest of the universe, and he probably isn't ready to face it all yet. Maybe a week or two in the Doctor's time. Then he meets Rose and everything begins. He never looked in the mirror for those weeks because he didn't want to look. Not because of the changes but because he didn't want to face himself in the mirror and realize what he did.

Susan is the only other Timelord we know about that the Doctor had such a strong relationship with, and the actress is more than a passing resemblance to Susan plus lots and lots of years, which is my reasoning there -- As for Romana, primarily because she's there, and she's the only other Timelord who's been with the Doctor for any great length of time and has learnt to stand, incorruptible, with him.

Here's an experiment: any time you see ""Jews Against XXX"", ""Mothers Against YYY"" or ""Black Lesbian One-Legged Small People Against ZZZ"", try substituting in ""White(s)"" and see if it still sounds as appealing. 

If they really want to start a local peace force then great.  But they should call it the ""Stamford Hill Peace Force"" and make it open to all.  Or they could call it the ""Stamford Hill Neighbourhood Watch"" scheme and pop along to their local police station and pick up some free stickers and posters.

*We present Steven Moffat's short story - originally published in the 2006 Doctor Who Annual - upon which Blink is based.*

My name is Sally Sparrow.

I am 12 years old, I have auburn hair, braces you can hardly see, a dent in my left knee from where I fell off a bicycle when I was ten, and parents. I also have a little brother called Tim. My Mum told Mrs Medford that Tim Wasn't Planned, and you can tell because his nose isn't straight and his hair sticks up and I can't believe you'd do all that on purpose. Or his ears.

I am top in English, and Miss Telfer says I have an excellent vocabulary. I have sixteen friends who are mainly girls. I haven't taken much interest in boys yet, because of the noise.

This is the story of the mysterious events that happened to me at my fat Aunt's cottage at Christmas and what I discovered under the wallpaper of my bedroom, which caused me to raise my eyebrows with perplexity.

I was staying at my fat Aunt's cottage because my Mum and Dad had gone on a weekend away. Tim was staying with his friend Rupert (who I don't think was planned either because of his teeth) and I found myself once more in the spare bedroom at my Aunt's cottage in the countryside, which is in Devon.

I love my Aunt's cottage. From her kitchen window you can only see fields, all the way to the horizon, and it's so quiet you can hear water dripping off a leaf from right at the end of the garden. Sometimes, when I lie in bed, I can hear a train far away in the distance and it always fills me with a big sighing feeling, like sadness, only nice. It's good, my bedroom at my aunt's. Really big, with a wardrobe that rattles its hangers when you walk past it and huge yellow flowers on the wallpaper. When I was little I used to sit and stare at those flowers and when no one was looking I'd try to pick them, like they were real flowers. You can still see a little torn bit where I tried to peel one off the wall when I was three, and every time I go into the room, the first thing I do is go straight to that flower and touch it, just remembering and such. I've talked about it with my Dad and we think it might be Nostalgia.

It's because of that flower and the Nostalgia that I first met the Doctor.

It was three days before Christmas. I'd just arrived at my fat Aunt's house, and as usual, I'd hugged her and run straight upstairs to my room, to hang all my clothes in the rattley wardrobe. And as usual I'd gone straight to the torn yellow flower on the wall, and knelt beside it (I'm bigger now) and touched it. But this time, I did something different. I don't know why. I heard my Aunt calling from downstairs that I shouldn't be too long, because she'd cooked my favourite and it was on the table, and usually I'd have run straight down. Maybe it was because I knew she'd want to talk about school and sometimes you don't want to talk about school (sorry, Miss Telfer) especially if you've got braces and frizzy hair and people can be a bit silly about that kind of thing, even if they're supposed to be your friends. Maybe it was because I was thinking about being three, and how much smaller the flowers looked now.

Actually I think it was because Mary Phillips had made up a song about my hair and I was feeling a bit cross and my eyes were all stingy and blurry the way they get when you know you're going to cry if you don't really concentrate. Anyway, my fingers were resting right on the torn bit, and I was thinking about the song, and frizziness and such, and suddenly it was like I just didn't care! And I started to tear the paper a little bit more! Just a tiny bit at first, I just sort of tugged it to see what would happen. And I kept going! And you know sometimes it's like you're in a dream - you're doing something, but it doesn't feel like you're doing it, more like you're just watching? Well, I went right on and peeled the whole flower off the wall. A whole streak of wallpaper and I just ripped it right off!

And then, oh my goodness me! I just stared!

I once read in a story about a girl who got a fright and the writer said she felt her hair stand on end. I thought that was rubbish and would look really stupid, like my brother. I thought the writer was probably making that bit up, because it couldn't happen. But I was wrong. I could feel it happening now, starting up my neck, all cold, then all my scalp just fizzing and tingling.

And here is what was written under the wallpaper. 'Help me, Sally Sparrow'.

I looked closer, trying to work out if it was a trick, and noticed something else. More words, written just under those ones, but still covered by the wallpaper. Well, I thought, I'd already ruined it so I had nothing to lose. As carefully as I could, I tore off another strip. Beneath the words was just a date. 24/12/85.

Twenty years ago, someone in this room, asked for my help. Eight years before I was even born!

true,[deleted],null,null,"'Christmas Eve, 1985? Sorry love, I don't really remember.' My Aunt was frowning at me across the dinner table, trying to think.

'Can you really try, please? It's ever so important. Maybe you had guests, or friends staying or something? Maybe in my room.'

'Well we always had Christmas parties, when your uncle was still alive.'

'He is still alive, he's living in Stoke with Neville.'

'You could check in the shed.'

'Why would he be in the shed, Auntie, he's very happy with -'

'For the photographs.' She was looking at me, all severe now. 'If we had a party we always had photographs. I always keep photographs, I'll have a look around.'

'Thanks, Auntie!'

'What does it matter though? Why so interested?'

I nearly told her, but I knew she'd laugh. Because really, if you think about it, there was only one explanation. Coincidence. There must have been another Sally in the family I'd never heard about, and whoever had written that on the wall twenty years ago, they hadn't meant me, they'd meant her. They'd meant that mysterious other Sally from twenty years ago. I wondered what she

was like. I wondered where she was now, and if her hair was frizzy. And I wondered most of all why she'd been kept a dark secret all these many years. Perhaps she'd been horribly murdered for Deadly Reasons!

As I was about to go to bed, I looked hard at my Aunt - the way I do when I'm warning adults not to lie to me - and asked, 'There was another Sally Sparrow, wasn't there, Auntie? I'm not the first, am I?'

My Aunt looked at me really oddly for a moment. I half expected her to stagger back against the mantelpiece, all pale and clutching at her bosom, and ask in quivery tones how I had uncovered the family secret and have terrible rending sobs. But no, she just laughed and said

'No, of course not! One Sally Sparrow is quite enough. Now off to bed with you!'

I lay in my bed but I couldn't sleep! There had to be another Sally, there just had to be. Otherwise someone from twenty years ago was trying to talk to me from under the wallpaper and that was just stupid!

When my Aunt came in to kiss me goodnight (I always pretend to be asleep but I never am) I heard her put something on my bedside table. As soon as I heard her bedroom door close, I jumped and switched the light on! Maybe this was it! Maybe this was her dark confession - the truth about the other Sally Sparrow, and her Dreadful Fate. Sitting on my bedside table was a box. I gasped horrendously! I wondered how big a box would have to be to contain human remains! I narrowed my eyes shrewdly (and also bravely) and looked at the label on the lid (though I did think labelling murdered human remains would be a bit of an obvious mistake).

The label said 'Photographs 1985'.

The Christmas party ones were right at the bottom, and took me ages to find. They were just the usual kind, lots of people grinning and drinking, and wearing paper hats. My fat Aunt was there, still with Uncle Hugh, and my Mum and Dad too looking all shiny and thin. And then I saw it! My eyebrows raised in perplexity again, slightly higher this time. Because standing right in the middle of one of the photographs was a man with a leather jacket and enormous ears. He was in the middle of a line of grown-ups laughing and dancing, but he was looking right at the camera and holding up a piece of paper like a sign. And on the sign it said 'Help me, Sally Sparrow!'

I gasped in even more amazement. There was another Sally Sparrow and obviously she was taking the photograph. And probably she was a bit deaf, and you had to talk to her with paper signs, because hearing aids hadn't been invented yet.

And then I looked at the next photograph. And that's when everything changed. Suddenly it was like the school bell was ringing in my ears and I could feel my heart thudding in my chest so hard you could probably have seen the buttons bouncing on my pyjamas.

There was the man again, at the back of the photograph, holding up another piece of paper. And this one said 'Look under the wallpaper again.'

As I reached for the wallpaper again my hand was shaking away like when you try to do your homework on the school bus. The next bit of writing was much longer and this is what it said.

'This isn't a dream, and by the way you should never try to do your homework on the school bus. I'm going to prove this is real. Think of a number, any number at all, and then get dressed, find a torch, and see what's carved in the bark of the furthest tree in the garden.'

When people think of a number, they always think of ten, or seven or something. They never think of a really big, stupid one. So I did, I thought of a big, stupid one. Then I halved it. Then I added my age. Then I took away Tim's age. Then I added four, just because I felt like it. And then a few minutes later, I was standing in the garden, shivering, staring at the furthest tree.

And there it was, carved like it had been there forever. No one ever thinks of the number 73. Except me. And the man who had carved the furthest tree in my Aunt's garden twenty years ago.

I sat on my bed for ages, just shaking and wondering what to do now. But it was obvious really. I tore off the next strip of wallpaper. This time, it just said 'Top shelf in the living room, right at the back.'

true,[deleted],null,null,"The top shelf was where my Aunt kept all her videos. She hardly ever watched television, never mind videos, so they were all very dusty. And right at the back, jammed half way down the gap at the back of the shelf, was a tape that looked like it had been there for a long time. And stuck on it, a post-it. It said 'FAO Sally Sparrow'.

I slipped it into the VCR and kept the television volume really low, so as not to wake my Aunt.

And there, grinning like a loon from the television, was the man from the photographs. 'Hello, Sally Sparrow! Any questions?'

He was sitting in my bedroom! Only the walls were bare, and there was a pair of ladders in the middle of the room, like someone was decorating. I could hear party music coming from somewhere downstairs, and I wondered if it was the party in 1985.

'Well, come on, Sally!' the man was saying, 'You've gotta have questions. I would.'

I frowned. Not a lot of point in asking questions when the man you're asking can't hear them!

'Who says I can't hear you?' grinned the man.

I stared! I think I probably gasped. My eyebrows were practically bursting out of the top of my head. It was ridiculous, it was impossible. I hadn't even said that out loud.

'No, you didn't,' said the man, checking on a piece of paper, 'You just thought that.' He glanced at the paper again. 'Oh, and yeah, you did gasp.'

'Who are you?' I blurted.

'That's more like it, now we're cooking. I'm the Doctor. I'm a time traveller and I'm stuck in 1985, and I need your help.'

I had so many questions racing round my head I didn't know which one to pick.

'How did you get stuck?' I said.

'Parked my time machine in your Aunt's shed. Was just locking up, and it... well... burped.'

'Burped??'

'Yeah, burped. Shot forward twenty years, I hate it when that happens.'

I looked out the window to where my Aunt's shed stood at the end of the garden. And I noticed there was something glowing at the windows. Suddenly, I was just a little bit afraid. 'So it's here then?'

'Exactly. Nip out to your Aunt's shed, you'll find a big blue box, key still in the door. Could just stick around for twenty years and pick it up myself but I don't want it falling into the wrong hands.' He leaned forward to the camera, and his eyes just burned at me. 'And I know you're not the wrong hands, Sally Sparrow. So I want you to fly it back to me!'

I swallowed hard. This was totally freaky.

He glanced at his paper again. 'You've got another question, I think.'

He was right. 'You're just on video tape. How can you hear me??'

He smiled. 'Actually, I can't. Can't hear a thing. I just happen to know everything you and me are gonna say in this whole conversation.'

'How??'

'Cos Mary Phillips made up a song about your hair.'

I could hardly breathe for all the gasping.

'And you punched her, didn't you, Sally Sparrow?

And then you got a punishment?'

My face was burning. How did he know all this?

I hadn't even told my Mum and Dad.

'You got Christmas homework. An essay about what you did over the Christmas holidays.' He grinned. 'And I've got a copy!'

And this is freakiest part of all. Because he held a copy of the actual essay I'm writing right now!!

'I know everything you're gonna ask when you see this tape, cos I've read the essay you wrote about it. That's how I knew what to write on the wall - you'll have to show me exactly where, by the way - and that's how I knew what number you were thinking of.'

'But... but...' I could hardly think for my mind racing. 'How did you get a copy of my Christmas homework! I haven't even written it yet!!'

'Told you, I'm a time traveller. I got it in the future. From a beautiful woman on a balcony in Istanbul.' He smiled, like it was happy memory. 'She was some sort of spy, I think. Amazing woman! I'd just had a sword fight on the roof with two Sontarans, and she saved me from the second one. Then she gave me your Christmas homework and told me to keep it on me at all times, cos I'd need it one day.' He grinned.

'She was right!'

A spy, in the future, was going to have a copy of my Christmas homework? Talk about pressure!

He was looking at his watch. 'Okay, that's just about time up. Gonna need you to go to the time machine, and fly it here.'

'I can't fly a time machine. I had stabilisers on my bike till I was nine!!'

'Sally, I absolutely know that you can do this. And do you know how?'

'How?'

'Because I've read to the end of the story.' He laughed. 'Also - you hear that noise?'

Coming from the television, a terrible wheezing and groaning.

'What's that??'

He was still grinning.

'That's you!'

Behind the man, a huge blue box just appeared out of thin air. I stared at it. There were words over the door and I squinted closer to read them.

I should've known. He looked like a policeman!

'That's your time machine?'

'Yep. Like it?'

'But who flew it there?'

You could almost get tired of that grin. 'You did!'

The doors on the big blue box were opening. And then the most amazing thing ever. I stepped out of the box!! Me! Sally Sparrow! Another me stepped out of the time machine and waved at the camera.

'Hello, Sally Sparrow, two hours ago!' said the other me. 'It's great in there, you're going to love it. It's bigger on the inside!'

'See?' said the man. 'Told you you could fly a time machine.'

'Yeah, it's easy!' said the other Sally, 'It homes in on his watch, anyway. You just have to press the reset button next to the phone.'

'Who told you that?' I asked her.

A frown clouded her face. 'I did,' she said, and looked puzzled.

The man looked a little cross about that.

'Yeah, well before you set off any more time paradoxes... Sally Sparrow!' he gave me a Teacher look from the television. 'Go and do your homework!'

'Yeah!' said the other Sally, 'You've

got to write the essay before you can fly

the time machine. It'll take you about two hours.'

'That's enough, both of you!' said the man, 'Got enough paradoxes going on here, without you pair having a chat!'

'But, listen, it's going to be great!' said the other Sally. And she gave me the biggest, most excited smile ever.

And oh goodness! You can see my braces!

And so here I am, finishing my essay. It's nearly two o'clock in the morning, and in a minute I'll be fetching the shed key from the kitchen drawer and setting off across the garden on the trip of a lifetime.

A big, amazing adventure. And not my last one either, oh no! Just the first of lots and lots, for the rest of my life probably. Suddenly I don't care what my Aunt is going to say about the torn wallpaper or what Mary Phillips thinks about my hair. I'll go back to school after the holidays and just be nice to her, and she can make up all the songs she wants. I'll join in, if it makes her happy.

You see, I know the best thing in the world. I know what's coming. I asked the man one more question before the end of the tape. I asked how a beautiful woman spy in the future could have a copy of my Christmas homework.

'Can't you guess?' he smiled. Not grinned, smiled. 'Her name,' he continued, 'Was Sally Sparrow.'

The big blue box is waiting in the shed at the end of the garden. And I've finished my homework.

true,Kim147,uk,British Sandgroper,"I think there have been a number of things going on . Firstly there are certainly problems with pollution , overuse of natural resources and the oil running out . But to confuse the AGW debate with this 1% of truth is obviously wrong . The AGW science is extremely flawed - this is well documented . CO2 lags temperature by 800 years - it is a result not a cause - this is due to it's solubility in water ( ie. sea water ) . Further most of the modern day temperature data has been measured at weather stations that are in areas that have been urbanised and hence have had their figures distorted by the heat island effect . The percentage that CO2 makes up in the greenhouse gases is extremely small - water vapour is by far the biggest greenhouse gas . Further the percentage that AGW related CO2 makes up in the overall CO2 is also very small . The effect than man has is very small - natural effects are far larger . Greenhouse gasses are vitally important for keeping our planet warm enough for life and for preventing extremes of temperature . Spending vast sums of money on AGW ( like we did on CFCs ) will not have any large effect and it will be a misplacing of resources - if the World is heating up - as it might do naturally - then any effect should be prepared for - ie. sea walls built - not CO2 reduced . Anyway - if you want to reduce CO2 - prevent the deforestation and green the deserts - plants are very good sequesters of CO2 . It is actually very debatable whether the World is actually heating up . If anything it looks like the temperatures have flattened out . There is certainly no correlation , either in modern history - eg. the Medieval Warm Period and the Mini Ice Age - or over long term between the global temperatures and man's activities . Also - it is very important to have faith in nature - nature has ways of compensating . Our current year we have had a hot summer and a cold winter - if anything this is an indication of open sky desert conditions - ie. lack of insulation - ie. lack of greenhouse gasses . However one has to look at the trends over not only many hundreds , even thousands of years but also many hundreds of thousands of years . In doing this the correlation is very much with solar system and galactic events and in these the Sun spots play a very major part .

We were very much in a decade of scams in the last decade . The AGW is a massive scam along with the sub-prime mortgage scam etc. . The thing is this is real money , we don't have it , and the governments should be acting much more responsibly with it . There are many people who see their only means of survival is to run the scam - get the money before it runs out . The problem is that in running all these scams they are destroying all of us including themselves .

It's very important to think the logic through - to think through why people are saying what they are saying and doing what they are doing . It is also very important to look at what they actually do in practice . If , for example , they bang on about all the CO2 and then fly plane loads of people over to Copenhagen it obviously indicates that they don't believe what they are saying .

We , as a country , have been very much destroyed by the enemies within , whether these are politicians , people in banking and finance or environmentalists . These people have done far more damage than any Al Qaeda terrorists . It is time that these people stopped their scamming and their damaging and started growing up and acting responsibly and repair all the damage that they have caused .

true,leondz,eu,Britain,"If you register as self-employed, NICs (National Insurance Contributions) are currently about £31.20 a quarter, fixed rate. So, you don't have to work that much. HMRC will send you letters 28 days before your NI is due, and you can pay at a post office, via a cheque and the post, or of course with internet banking / bank transfer.

http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/Taxes/BeginnersGuideToTax/DG_4015904 - see ""If you're self-employed""

Liability coverage isn't required unless you have employees, but some clients will demand it. You should be able to pick up an excellent package from a reputable insurer for around £250/year.

It's easy to exit - you just stop taking on new work!

Taxes may be a problem if you're not comfortable with basic accounting, but the chances are, you will simply sit down with Excel for around 12 hours a year and work everything out. The UK financial year runs from around 4 April until the next April, and your tax return is due at the end of the following January. For example, for financial year 4 April 2008 - 3 April 2009, the tax return (a form that you send to the tax office, listing your income/outgoings etc) is due 31 January 2010. The rate depends on your earnings; have a look at listentotaxman.com to get a feel for it. Generally, the first £5 000 or so are untaxed, the next £35 000 taxed at around 22%, and the rest taxed at around 40%.

http://www.hmrc.gov and http://www.direct.gov have plenty of other information.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Fully recommend your other half go for it.

Some form of liability coverage might be useful, but is certainly not required. It all depends on the type of work he is planning to do, really, and possible costs if he fucks things up. ;)

He will have to fill out a tax return every year, and work out his own tax, but this is relatively easy, and the chances are he will pay quite a lot less tax than if he earned the same from a 'proper' job. I would advise having an accountant look at his first years return, to maximise the benefits. National Insurance is a bit different, but you can pay a 'voluntary' minimum, not linked to income. Once he tells the tax office he is going self-employed, they will send the relevant paperwork for all this.

As for exiting, in the IT world, it is not a problem. Some employers will not take on someone who has been self-employed, but in this field, he should not have any problems. Chances are, though, he would be best to continue freelance, and will probably prefer it. Being in charge of your own life is much better than working for someone else.

Also, he can probably keep on some form of work while doing his PhD, and have some useful contacts and references already set for once he finishes, so it's a win-win situation all round.

true,Gusfoo,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"Yep, I do.

I started freelancing about 3 years ago after being made redundant and it was the best career decision I have made in my life.

You need public liability insurance, yes. Getting personal liability insurance is a pretty good idea too in case you screw up badly and someone goes after you personally.

The simplest route is to use a billing company to take care of NI, Tax and insurance. They'll fill in all the forms for HRMC (Tax) and Customs and Excise (NI) and advise you on what can and can not be claimed as expenses. Your number 1 priority is getting your paper work straight and your number two is the yeild that you'll be getting from each pound billed. I get about 78% but with a car allowance, pension contributions and so on you can push that up to mid-80s.

When you get the work you call your billing company and get the to set up a billing relationship with your client. They'll provide you with timesheet and expenses templates. ALWAYS BILL WEEKLY! You'll probably be on 30 days invoicing terms so you don't want to be billing monthly and therefore waiting 60 days for payment. Also, don't expect to actually be paid on time without chasing the client's accountants (and do not be embarrassed about being a hard-arse with the client's accountant - it's expected and does not reflect badly on you)

Keep good records and you MUST retain all bank statements, receipts, paperwork related to any other income (no matter how trivial) because you'll need it for your personal tax return at the end of 2011 (as you file one year in arrears)

Exiting freelancing is easy. But be warned that it's emotionally tough to go from a world where you pick and choose your work and get very well paid for it to a world where you have to do what you're told and get paid a lot less.

Other random bits of advice:

* Claim every little thing you can on expenses. Your PC, stationary, travel, petrol, wear-and-tear on home office area furnishings. You can also claim £5/day without receipts for coffee-and-muffin.

* Don't be embarrassed about your day rate. Get used to saying it and seeing a slight wince on the face of your prospective client. The justification is that YOU are paying the employers national insurance so, while the number may look big (I charge close to 1K/day) it is perfectly justified.

* Understand, and be sympathetic to, your client's internal budgeting process. I had a customer who had no budget for contractors left for the year so we agreed fixed prices for jobs so they could treat me as a capital expense (which did have budget left) and let them know that if they do do it that way they can capitalise the expense (put it on the balance sheet) which flatters their accounting process.

* On completion of a job, always ask if you can use the the customer as a reference. You may not need it but it's good to have a list of people you can give to a prospect to allow them to check you out.

Finally, I'll say good luck, I hope it goes well for you.

We got civilized in our means of running our nations, but we didn't change the objective.

Our education system is a travesty of telling kids only what they need to be goo worker bees. 

We aren't exactly apposing our own oppression either, nor are we any less murderous in the name of our interests. War for Oil, war for diamonds, War for the sake of selling arms to both sides. 

I admit we can be a little more civilized about it all but I seroiusly think our impression of them, as fed to us in the media and by our government, is a pervesion of what's really going on.

Our own history doesn't exactly hold us in good standing either, ever heard of the crusades or the inquistion. Christian fundamentalism was born and flourishes in the west. 

The problem isn't Islam, it's a minority of people creating such a show that we find it hard to focus on anything else. Our own gevernments seem somehow complicit in keeping us fixed on the negatives too..

I'm not sure anyone on earth is any more or less evil minded than anyone else. I think it's all theatre and fiction, stories we tell ourselve to ease our minds. Afterall mass murder goes down better with a fictitous moral justification.

It's a tough world we live in, scary as hell if you see it for what it is. A lot of us westerners are very very invested in how deep we can bury our heads.

One of the good parts of the English empire was the promotion of a common language so that world could communicate easier.

I think we're going to look back at the last couple RTD seasons as great emotional story lines that get written into a corner and then…magic happens. Plot holes just get paved over with something new, something unforeseen. First we cut his hand off, then there's the great fall into the pit - okay, air cushion, sure - then  Agatha Christie, it was the sudden appearance of a diamond (that's just not leaving ANY clues), then regeneration without changing, or being struck by energy on Victoria Palace - and then by lightning in New York, flying down a kilometers-long hole with the screwdriver, now falling out of the sky... 

For suspense to work, and I mean for everyone - not just fans who'll forgive anything - you have to create stakes. I think ""Blink"" worked as well as it did primarily because we believed Sally could really be in danger.  Will he win, and at what cost? After a while, the mortal sense of the Doctor has just washed away; it's all about the emotional damage now. While it's a huge improvement over many of the Doctors of yore, making the Doctor virtually indestructible is pretty weak - it's like watching an old Bond film. 

Don't get me wrong - I'm a fan, a real dyed-in-the-wool fan - and I'm more excited about the future of DW than I've been in a while.

It has been written is such a way that it is very separate from the old series from the 70s and 80s.  Obviously it gives a little nod here and there to the old doctors, old villians, etc, but in general you can call it a whole new show and easily pretend the old series never existed if you want.

Thus from the point of view of modern TV execs, Dr Who has only been on for 4 or 5 seasons.  I'm willing to bet it will be milked for all its worth, well past 13 doctors.  

An actor probably won't stay for longer than 2 or 3 years.  So the next question to ask is will it last another 4 or 5 years (the time it will likely take to go throught the remaining doctors)?  I say yes...easily.  In fact I'm willing to bet the show can go strong for another 10 provided the right people do it.

Continue watching again normally until you get to *The Shakespeare Code*, after which just read the [Tardis Index File](http://tardis.wikia.com) page for [The Macra Terror](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Macra_Terror) (Actually watching the episode is impossible, although you could [listen to it](http://www.amazon.com/Macra-Terror-Doctor-Who/dp/0563477563/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1263075291&amp;sr=8-1), [read it](http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Who-Macra-Terror-Target/dp/0426203070/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1263075291&amp;sr=8-2), or browse the [BBC's photonovel](http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/photonovels/macra/) of it.  It's a decent story, but it drags a bit.)

Switch to the new series again until you finish *Blink*: Once you recover from that, watch the classic episode *The Deadly Assassin*, and ponder just how odd a title that is.

Back to the modern series until you reach *Planet of the Ood*, at which point watch either *The Sontaran Experiment* or *The Invasion of Time* - the former is shorter, but the latter is a better story.  Continue on to *The Sontaran Stratagem,* and beyond.  Congratulations, you now have enough classic background information to be caught up.

Or you could just watch the new series: The in-between jumpbacks I mention are more for richness of background rather than necessary material.",0,1263075863,null,0,true,0,c0ihw71,t3_ancgw,t1_c0ihw71,t3_ancgw,null,1426179476,21,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,21

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; Water is good or busting up some ice if you have a pond.

...but not if there are fish living in it.

Fish can survive under the ice of a frozen pond.  But the shock wave from someone trying to break the ice can rupture their swim bladders and kill them. 

So rather than just whacking the ice, try to lever up the ice sheet from the edge.  If you can lift it above the liquid water then you can safely give it a tap with a hammer and it should break without harming the fish.

Better still, boil a pan of water and let the pan rest on the ice until it melts.  Don't pour the hot water onto the ice as a sudden temperature change can also harm fish.   Once you've got a hole (or if you have the foresight to prepare in advance), leave a football, soda bottle or something else floating in the pond and the ice will freeze around it.  Then you can pull out the ball/bottle during the day to provide a drinking hole for the birds (and air exchange for the fish).

But if you are the ""preferred"" recovery service and have been asked to clear vehicles by the cops you'll be fine.

I had my motorcycle stolen once and reported to the cops. Then I got a phone call a day later from someone who had found it hidden behind some bushes in a local park. So I called the cops and arranged to meet them at the scene.

When I arrived my bike was pretty much OK, it had been hot-wired but it was perfectly useable. Instead of the cops turning up a recovery truck arrived and the guy was about to load my bike up and take it away. I refused to let him on the grounds that any fingerprint evidence would almost certainly be removed in the process, and I'd be without a bike and have to pay for the recovery before I could get it back.

The driver got pretty angry about this and told me he was taking the bike whether I liked it or not.

I stood my ground and he called the cops. He told them I was being *difficult* and then handed me the phone. The cops were very insistent that I should let the bike go but I still refused, saying that there was no way I was going to allow the machine to be taken away.

It shows the change in the percentage of deaths per million people that may be attributed to a particular cause without giving any indication of actual numbers. Some idea of the actual numbers involved might help give an indication as to whether the rise in the percentage of liver-related deaths is due to the advancement in methods of treatment in other areas.

In the UK - ""reasonable force"" is what you should use, and this usually only works if you're a 7 foot rugby player and they're 12 years old.

You  know... restrain them at arms length with one hand, and phone the police so they can pick them up. Be careful not to sprain their wrists.

Also - you could invite someone over to your house, and beat them up, or kill them! Once they start trying to defend themselves, looking at the scene later will show a struggle - not who started it.

Living in Northern Ireland and knowing the history, it's hard to say whether the decision to deploy British troops was a wise one. One of the claims the British army made when they first entered Northern Ireland was that they were there to protect the Catholics of the Bogside from the RUC (British police force)... but the decision ended up stoking up tensions even more. Bloody Sunday in Derry in 1972 was one of the main instigators of the troubles, which left thousands dead over the years. On the day, British paratroopers opened fire on a civil rights march (which the British declared as illegal), killing 14 people. 
The night after the killings was the largest recruitment night for the IRA.
Northern Ireland was never British to the Irish so it's understandable how they reacted under Unionist rule. The British army had no more right to remain in Northern Ireland than the IRA had. 

We can say that the British army were brought out to Afghanistan to protect civilians and rid them of the Taliban and Al Qaeda, but as we are well aware, the Afghanis suffered a similar fate to many people in Northern Ireland. Resistance organisations and the numbers of people joining the Taliban and Al Qaeda grew massively after the invasion, and continued to grow as the death toll rose. The British army have no right to be in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is a complicated situation, but the British army have no real use in remaining - their presence has only proved to strengthen extremist organisations and increase the risk of terrorism in the West. It's not up to foreign national armies to go against extremist organisations. It may be better to support the Afghan government and their police forces, but we still have to face the reality that there is going to be corruption and religious extremists who will make the country no better in the absence of the Taliban. The British army should exist only to defend Britain and extra resources can be used on peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. 

There is absolutely no justification for the war on Iraq, that's not really debatable as far as I'm concerned. 

Fighting fire with fire has never worked. The British army can do as much peacekeeping (as long as it's genuine peacekeeping)  as they want they just need to stay out of conflict. 

I can't bring myself to accept these soldiers as heroes. To be honest, I don't categorise them any differently to how I would categorise organisations like the IRA, the Taliban/Al Qaeda, Hamas etc. 
Because unfortunately, even organisations like Hamas (which was a democratically elected government, remember) have a good side to them - I've seen them giving out aid to old and young people. Nothing is black and white! (As for the Taliban/Al Qaeda), I honestly aren't aware of any redeeming factors about them. 

They all have their own interests, and until all sides are willing to make compromises, there can be no peace. Northern Ireland is a model example of how to achieve peace by both sides making compromises. 

This is why I don't agree with George Galloway - giving money to Hamas was not a good idea at all. I can understand his decision but I don't agree with it because the money can potentially be used for weapons that may be used to kill Israeli soldiers or civilians. The Palestinians have a right to defend themselves, but firing missiles into civilian areas is *not* a form of defence - it's tit-for-tat killings. They may be very angry for good reason, but like the Black civil rights movement in the US, they need to remain calm and work using peaceful methods and non-violent action to succeed.

He was jailed for life for murder but The Court of Appeal then reduced that to manslaughter. He served three years in jail. Earlier in December, Buckinghamshire businessman Munir Hussain was jailed for 30 months in different circumstances. Hussain had returned home to find that three intruders had tied up his family. He escaped and, with the help of his brother, chased one of the intruders, Walid Saleem. Hussain caught Saleem and hit him so hard with a cricket bat that he inflicted permanent brain damage. Saleem was incapable of entering a plea at trial and received a lesser sentence than the man whose house he broke into. He is appealing against his sentence.

The crux of the problem is that the government has a very strong track record on defining legislation or changing rules on the grounds of 'special cases', then using them for normal purposes. If we can't guarantee a jury's safety in this case, then when an inconvenient (to the state) court case comes up, there will be pressure put on to switch to a state-friendly judge and go for a judge only trial on the grounds of 'juror safety' or some such made up threat.

I can give you a prime example of this. When the police need to get a warrant to do something (sieze goods under SOCPA, search a property, detain someone without charge for extended periods or so on) they do what the police actually call '[Judge shopping](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1222777/The-raid-rocked-Met-Why-gun-drugs-op-6-717-safety-deposit-boxes-cost-taxpayer-fortune.html)' (apologies for the daily fail link but it is relevant). They'll try to find a friendly judge that they can scare or intimidate into letting them do what they want, pushing the necessary buttons. If they're knocked back they find another judge until it gets signed off.

The two biggest mistakes that people could make in this entire thing is think that a) the Government has the people's best interests at heart and b) that the police or CPS have the people's best interests at heart.

Give 'em a break.  They're trying to predict the future of a chaotic system.  We should accept the fact that any weather prediction ahead of a few hours is largely an educated guess.  Think of meteorologists as being more like racing tipster and set your expectations accordingly.
