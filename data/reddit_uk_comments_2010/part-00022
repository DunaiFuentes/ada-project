We all pay into the system, and we are all covered. Some get out more than they put in, but you do on any insurance system, too.

Honestly, the NHS is pretty much the only thing that I would regret leaving behind. 

I read some of the figures posted by Americans for the price they pay for health insurance, and its just astronomical. I pay about £4000 per year in income tax, about £4000 per year on VAT (assuming I spend my entire salary on VAT applicable goods, which I do not.) I pay pretty much no other tax that i can think of, so for all those who feel the need to point out 'its not free!!!!', I know, I'm not stupid, but I am paying far, far less per month in *total taxes* than some people are paying just for healthcare.

The NHS, as an institution is incredibly wasteful, in need of reform, and not perfect; anyone who claims to the contrary is blinded by the good of it. It is, however, in principle and motive, unrivaled, and in my opinion, the item that should be at the top of every governments list of where to spend its tax pounds/dollars/etc...

As for personal experience, if I'm I'll, i call the GP, i get an appointment within a couple of days, I goto the GP, he/she checks me out, gives me a prescription (if required), i cross the road, spend about the same as i would spend on a cup of coffee getting my pills or whatever, and go home, job done, not a care in the world. One of the best things I think though, and what I feel is often overlooked, is that if I'm even unsure, i can call the doctor and get checked, without the need to weigh up if I feel worried enough to spend the cash for peace of mind. Case in point, I have had shoulder pain for a while, with no real obvious cause, it wasn't bothering me, but it was nice to pop down to the doctor just to check.

true,dexcel,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"I wouldn't say I love the NHS, anymore than I love any other organisation. I would say it works to a certain point but then again it’s not the only type of system that works and certainly it could be improved. I say this from two points. 

The first is that I have experienced health care in a number of countries now (Switzerland, Canada and the UK).  Switzerland to date has been the best in terms of efficiency, quality of service and fixing the job. Both my mum and I have had to go to hospital for various reasons on separate occasions and each time the surgery appointment was in the immediate future after seeing our GP, so there was no long waiting list. We both had private rooms when we went there. The surgery was successful and we were kept in under observation without any hurry to push us out.

Canada was good, but I was on private health insurance at the time because I was over there on a 1 year assignment with work. I was having a medical for work which led to a follow up with a cardiologist which then led to me having an echocardiogram which then led to another follow up before ultimately having an MRI and meeting on of the top cardiologists in Calgary. This was all in the space of 2 weeks. No hanging about, no waiting around, it was quick and efficient. The only down side was the Canadian cardiologist was a little excitable and was talking all about heart surgery and the like while when I saw the last cardiologist who actually was English, he told me to start popping some pills and he would see how that progressed before there is any talk of opening me up and making me a cardiac cripple. The latter turned out to be the better option and the pills keep the situation under control.  I know however this is not a typical experience perhaps with Canada as I was just waving my companies money about to get the problem sorted. 

The NHS, it’s been okay. The GP's haven't had much knowledge about my heart condition and keep trying to correct me when I say what it is by suggesting that it is a more common type of cardiomyopathy before I pull out all the paperwork to put them straight. But they have been good in sorting out my meds and giving me 2 month repeat prescriptions. However if I need an echocardiogram the waiting list is 6-8 weeks so I just go private every time and the waiting list is 10-14 days from when I call up.

The second, I have also seen the NHS from the point of view from my GF who works for it. And I have to say it is a little insane. They have gone from not having enough doctors to having too many doctors. They have screwed around with the training system repeatedly such that people can’t get on a training scheme and effectively their career is put on hold. They have dicked about with the out of hours so junior doctors don’t get as many hours learning before they progress  and cut wages so that a junior doctor now starts on 21-22 grand. 

The best bit is what they are tested on. Recently my GF qualified as a GP. Part of the GP practical exam is seeing 12 patients under “real patient” situations. Part of the exam is making sure that the patient is involved with choosing the treatment for their problems and being actively involved so they feel part of the process. Which is all well and good however the overriding  pass/fail criteria is can you get them in and out of the door within 10 minutes. Which for me just sums up the disjointed nature of it. The doctor is told to involve the patient more which takes more time but then in the same situation has to do it under 10 mins.

TDLR; Anyways If I was in the US I wouldn’t be looking to the NHS as a model. Just as I wouldn’t look to the US as a model in how to improve the NHS. There are another 170+ countries out there which have varying levels of healthcare with different systems which are better and worse than what you have in the US or the UK. Look to those countries for your ideas.

Also it annoys me when people say the NHS is free. Its not, yes you don’t pay for the treatment up front but you do pay for it through your taxes.

Do you not think a lot of the problem in America is profiteering? Is there a more desperate group than the sick,  and is there a more guaranteed market than health insurance? It is abundantly clear that the insurance companies can charge extortionate amounts for health insurance, and know that those who can afford it, Will pay, because it's simply foolish not to. And for those who can't afford it, well, tough luck i guess.

This, to me, is the fundamental difference in the two systems, call it socialist if you like, but the NHS is not run for profit, American health services are almost entirely private entities which have an over riding desire not to provide care, but to create profit.

I think it has done more than anything else in ensuring that the gap in standard of life has not dramatically widened in this country.

However, the last twenty years have altered the way it is used and viewed by the British public. When the NHS and Welfare State were created after the war the idea was for the Welfare State to care for British citizens ""from the cradle to the grave"", whereas the NHS was ""at the point of need"". The institutions have swapped roles over the years, the NHS now provides a cradle to grave type service and the welfare state now intervenes at the point of need. Undoubtedly this has place a massive burden on the NHS and is responsible for creating the lumbering behemoth that we are familiar with. In turn, the welfare state has become almost despised as the perception of it is that of a clueless old granny dispensing money to it's no good, leaching grandchildren.

Despite all the detractors, they still provide a service that has helped so many. We have a real safety net in our society and when people fall i'm proud that the collective can support them. There will always be people that take advantage of such mechanisms and try to defraud the system but the answer has never been to remove such mechanisms, but to educate and reform offenders.

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"I worked for the NHS for 3 years in a Primary Care Mental Health Team and while it was at times infruiating, I was also immensely proud of the things we did. On the negative side, it is a very odd institution to work for. I think it's the second largest civilian employer in the world and as a result, it has developed some truly Byzantine aspects in the way it operates. Some of this is down to the sheer size of the beast, but it's also to do with the fact that it's a political football and often decisions are made for reasons that have nothing to do with medical practice (this is particularly true if the government at the time gets the 'reform' bug).

 A weird consequence of this was that I learnt very quickly that no-one in the NHS ever asks you to do anything twice. Basically, a dictat from the Department of Health will arrive, everyone will go slightly mad trying to fit in whatever the dictat involves around actually running a health service and then by the time all the plans are put into place, a new dictat will arrive that effectively cancels out the previous one. I found it was far easier to just not bother and get on with the more important work of treating people.

On the plus side though, it is a truly equitable service. It doesn't matter if you're a beggar or a viscount, you will get the same service and you will get it for free. The standard of care is generally very good and although there are areas where the constant pressure of running a huge service on finite funds leads to less than perfect conditions, at least you know that you will be taken care of, no matter who/what/why/where/when. That's something we should be cherish and it's become a keystone in British society that we are rightly proud of.

Post Childbirth UK: health visitor to the home every day for 2 weeks: general help and advice for 40-60 minutes, then weekly health visits for quite a while after.  This can get a bit excessive, and e.g. my sister changed it so she went to the clinic rather than waiting for a home visit.

US Palliative care: very elderly dying patient kept in hospital given aggressive, futile treatments resulting in terrible quality of the last couple of weeks in a strange and bewildering environment.

UK Palliative care: extensive arrangements made to keep patient in own home.  Equipment brought to the home (bed, lift, commode etc.) to facilitate.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"I don't know how many negative responses you'll get from this, so let me try and balance the books slightly. My father has worked in the NHS for getting on 40 years (currently a consultant radiologist), so I've heard it all.

1) Any good health service is a victim of its own success; the more people you help live longer, the more people you have to look after. With ageing populations (as in the UK/Europe but not the US) this creates a big problem in ever expanding healthcare costs. This is partially accounted for in something known as 'NHS Inflation', which is typically much higher then national inflation (8%-10%-ish).

2) Its always a struggle to attract the right management staff to the public sector, as it means setting salaries that compete with comparable private sector jobs. This can create friction between hospital staff (lowly paid nurses and highly paid middle-managers). But if you don't get the right people in those positions you can end up wasting a lot more money then you save.

3) The NHS is a political football, and politicians often do not make decisions for the right reasons.

4) Funding is controlled by availability not demand, and hospitals can sink fighting for the extra staff they need to meet the targets imposed on them by government.

5) Target-driven working culture - if you don't meet a throughput target you loose money next year. This means the system is designed for speed and good headlines, not efficiency. The Government might get to release a headline saying '95% of all patients seen by a specialist within 7 days of GP referral', but those patients might not get a follow-up appointment or diagnosis for months afterwards as a consequence.

6) Some people will always abuse pubic services - 20-somethings get them selves too drunk then go to the emergency department in an ambulance to get their stomach pumped, all at the tax payers expense.

7) Pass-the-buck culture; GP's will sometimes refer on pointless cases because it costs them nothing to do so. Radiologists like my father then get requests like 'sore foot-please scan' at a cost of a few hundred pounds to the tax payer, when all the patient really needs is to swallow anti-inflammatories and take it easy. Doctors are over-cautious due to the risks of lawsuits, and because there is no reason not to be. 

8) Rationing is inevitable; Fox news has that right (well sort-of right). You can't fund everything for everyone from the public purse. We have a group called NICE who decides if new treatments give benefits worth their cost, and that avoids the (frankly a bit ridiculous) drugs-that-dont-really-do-anything-but-cost-lots culture in the US, but controversy is inevitable here. Every decision you make will be challenged by someone.

9) Private or Public - the NHS is a system of total equality; the judge and the janitor getting the same treatment on the same ward. If you want private healthcare you have to go completely private and fund everything yourself. But this can seem unfair to the middle class who can afford individual treatments but not the whole thing, and so can't get the more expensive cancer treatments that the NHS won't fund (but that you can get in the US on insurance).

10) Allowing 'top-up' treatments is being considered (and also being heavily pushed by American Pharma companies keen to open up the UK's middle-class market) but this would inevitably create a two-tier system of 'haves' and 'have-nots'. 

I'm a big fan of the NHS and wouldn't swap it for the world, but that doesn't mean we can pretend its without some serious problems and that we could learn something from countries with combination public/private healthcare systems.",0,1283449154,null,0,false,0,c0yds03,t3_d8hfr,t1_c0yds03,t1_c0ybyfe,null,1426449599,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6
true,[deleted],null,null,"This is a x-post from the other thread. It's not a list of reasons why I love the NHS, but rather a list of reasons why I don't love the US system as compared to the NHS. I hoped it might provide an interesting perspective. 

I am a UK citizen, currently a US resident for the last 6 years. I LOVE the NHS and would wave a magic socialist wand and bring it over here in a heartbeat if I could. Yes, even if that meant my taxes going up. And I would do this for a few reasons.

* Firstly, I think the system here wastes an incredible amount of my time. There is a huge amount of admin to do. Tons of paperwork is generated and needs to be watched closely to check that the insurance company is not denying coverage on legitimate claims (something that is in their interests to do). Then if you try to get snazzy and use a payflex card (a card that acts like a credit card, but has a pretax, prepaid amount of money on it) to pay for your medical expenses you have to provide documentation to them too. Try switching between insurance companies, that will take another huge amount of time. I have literally spent DAYS on the phone to insurance companies and managing paperwork.

* Secondly, there's no transparency in to what you're actually likely to be charged either. So any time you have anything beyond a regular doctor visit it's anyone's guess how much you'll be billed for it.

* Thirdly, an uneasy feeling everytime you are told you need a procedure or a follow up appointment, wondering whether you really need it or if you are just a means to the industry making more money. This was especially noticeable during my pregnancy and delivery. My doctors here seemed much quicker to intervene compared to friends' experiences in the UK.

* Fourthly, a niggling doubt that if the worst came to the worse the insurance company would find some way to wriggle out of paying and you'd find yourself one of the many INSURED people bankrupted by medical bills they thought they were covered for.
    
* Fifthly, the unfairness of it all.

* Sixthly, my choice of doctors is limited to those in my network.

After assembling the bike and getting it ready for the Summer in 2002 I decided that yes, it was fine and that I should go home, grab a bite and head out for the day. I pointed the bike at my exit from the roundabout and dabbed the front brake. With a new front tyre, the bike slid away from under leaving me to deal with the tarmac.

No biggy, I thought. Although it did turn out to be broken. Still not a biggy but enough to want me to get it fixed.

NHS services are far from perfect, and depending on the region can be pretty awful. But I know many Brits from many parts of the country who have received decent and fairly timely (and heavily subsidized or outright free after taxes) treatment for everything from minor operations to life-threatening conditions. One of my friends in the UK had THREE liver transplants on the NHS (and no his liver failing was not his fault or due in any way to alcohol abuse). If he'd been State-side (and not insanely wealthy), he have been lucky to receive one transplant. Would such a tactic simply be 'survival of the fittest'? Maybe. But equally it would be ethically disgraceful in a modern developed society. This is just personal experience of course, but for me the contrast between the flawed and bloated but largely adequate NHS and the much worse (and equally bloated) disaster that is the American healthcare system is stark.

I have a good friend who was raised Republican and indoctrinated with the idea that government run healthcare is terrible and private healthcare is brilliant. Then she started working in HR and dealing with US healthcare companies as part of her job. She was horrified by the callous, greedy, corrupt policies she had to navigate to get her employees the services they were paying for. She also witnessed first hand the skyrocketing costs which her employer had to pay for said services. At the same time she heard aboout my friends and family back in the UK getting decent treatment for comparatively less. Suffice to say, her opinion has changed substantially after that.

So TLDR... the NHS is flawed and imperfect. But having seen both sides of the coin, I can tell you that it's still much better than the current US private network system.",0,1283458227,null,0,false,0,c0yearl,t3_d8hfr,t1_c0yearl,t3_d8hfr,null,1426449877,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

In Quality we are close. Its access to the top tier medicine's that the US is ahead on. We have MRI's, advanced medicine stuff like that. We don't still use leeches and shit like that.

You seem to think their is a gulf in Quality when there is none. Its just access to that quality.

Let me tell you how this work as I was a receiving end of it. Once you get to see a specialist for the first time (within 18 weeks at most and 8.6 weeks average which is unbelievably long wait in private paid care), you wait months to see the specialist for the second time.

In my opinion, so long as I get better, I don't really care about how 'high' the standards are. I've used the NHS and found the doctors and nurses to be very knowledgeable and friendly, and the whole experience was very comfortable. Granted, I wasn't seriously ill, but everybody was supportive, reassuring and they had everything they needed to fix me up. I don't really see how it could have been better, besides perhaps less of a wait (waited 1 and a half hours in the waiting room).

When I say ""higher standard"", I suppose I really meant that you don't have to wait so long to get treatment. I suppose the thread count on the bedsheets might be higher too. But I'm of the opinion that the important thing is that you recover from what's ailing you. The fact that only a portion of the US population even *receive* healthcare makes it a pretty shitty standard in my mind, no matter how shiny the actual facilities may be.

I said it's a far superior *system* to any privately-funded healthcare *system*, and I don't think you can really argue with that by citing 'higher standards', that is neither here nor there.

Lots of smaller components. Often we do much of our gearing that way, so that when for example a DC motor has to rotate a bearing, we use the machine to create the components that transfer energy efficiently (read: gears). Also, a Geneva Drive seems likely, and a great number of other smaller components.

&gt; how limited are you at printing some objects?

This one can create supports, so that you can have overhangs etc (so a hollow sphere should be fine, as long as there's access in to it (even miniscule - this is to allow chemicals to eat away the support structures).

The big limitation is speed. Our first component was perhaps 10cm x 15cm x 1cm and it took 14 hours to print. This was admittedly because we went with 90% filling, but the fact is that we need very rugged components. How we're actually compensating for this is that we're creating sort of spiderwebby structures now with as much space as possible to optimize the printing.

Other than the time there seem to be very few limitations.

Yes indeed, we did this as well. Fortunately Bits from Bytes is a local company so didn't have to worry about that with them.

I'll warn you that 80% of your problems will come from the extruder, though getting the axis' to move *smoothly* is also non-trivial.

true,sirbruce,null,null,"&gt; Does VLC support DVDs from all regions?
This mostly depends on your DVD drive. Testing it is usually the quickest way to find out. The problem is that a lot of newer drives are RPC2 drives these days. Some of these drives don't allow raw access to the drive untill the drive firmware has done a regioncheck. VLC uses libdvdcss and it needs raw access to the DVD drive to crack the encryption key. So with those drives it is impossible to circumvent the region protection. (This goes for all software. You will need to flash your drives firmware, but sometimes there is no alternate firmware available for your drive). On other RPC2 drives that do allow raw access, it might take VLC a long time to crack the key. So just pop the disc in your drive and try it out, while you get a coffee. RPC1 drives should 'always' work regardless of the regioncode. 

That's what I could find, anyway.  If it works for you, great!

In **The Seeds of Death** they actually have a satellite around Earth send of a fake homing beacon, so the Ice Warrior ships, thinking they're landing on the Moon, instead travel too close to Earth and whip around into a hyperbolic orbit that winds up sending them into (or at least too close to) the Sun.

true,Orbixx,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"What on earth is the problem with being ID'd? I carry my drivers licence with me pretty much any time I go out, whether I plan on drinking, simply just buying drink for later consumption or just not drinking at all.

I don't get ID'd that often, but when I do, it's no hassle. People have a job to do and laws have to be obeyed. Age is an ambiguous thing, so regulations have to be enforced strictly.

The argument of not having a drivers licence or a passport is moot, because quite frankly, if you have neither, you shouldn't be drinking, you should be working a job to get one or the other.

Also, as for causing confusion as to where the legal precedent is - good lord, are people really this stupid? You live in this damn country and you're unsure what the legal age is for drinking alcohol? Get a fucking grip.

Not only that, but I for one think in retrospect of my experiences growing up around individuals who drink a hell of a lot, that the legal drinking age should be raised to 20 or 21. It seems to be taking a lot longer for kids to grow up these days and alcohol causes more problems than it solves in a lot of communities.

Call me a killjoy, whatever, you can fuck off. If you can't have fun without alcohol, you've got a problem.

Being able to buy alcohol is a privilege, not a human right. Be glad you're able to buy alcohol full stop. A lot of work goes into the creation, distribution, importing, exporting and management of the alcoholic beverage industry.

Yet people feel it necessary to complain about a few incidents where some hard working individual feels that you look under the legal drinking age and wishes to protect his job and potentially his family, perhaps even thinking for the welfare of the potentially underage individual he's contemplating serving - particularly when it's *your* fault for not bringing identification with you to prove that the transaction you are about to make is legal.

I've seen too many kids the same age that I was at the time get hospitalised through alcohol misuse, all of which could've been averted if the shopkeeper asked for ID. ""Hold on"", you say, ""It's her fault for being an utter retard"" - well quite, I agree, however she (can you tell I'm thinking of somebody in particular) was too young to realise the consequence of her actions and ended up nearly killing herself due to inexperience and possibly peer pressure.

So, next time you get ID'd, don't call the person a cunt, think about how many times being ID'd has potentially saved a hospital trip, or even a life. Think of how much of your tax money it may have saved by a kid not having to be brought into hospital by an ambulance; stay in overnight, having his/her stomach pumped and treated for alcohol poisoning.

Think about it.

God damn it, this annoys me.

They explain that there is potentially, tiny, completely unharmful amounts of trace carcogins in extremely burnt bacon, sometimes. I guess they didn't say the bacon was harmful, they just wonder why it doesn't deny being harmful.

In case that didn't worry you they immediately fry some potato slices and claim there might be the same dangers in cooking veg. That is if you normally cut your potatoes into slices and fry them beyond edibility. They mention as an aside this also produces tiny amounts of potentially harmful chemicals.

They ""plunge"" a burning splint into a bag of salad to prove how much Nitrogen is in the bag to preserve it. The man in a lab coat explains this is not harmful. Cut to slow motion scenes of bags being opened with sinister music in the background.

Large scale protests inevitably bring out the polices subversive tactics in a bid to gain a legal footing for control, this comes in many forms, the kettle, crowd plants and designated hitters.

However, like I say, if enough people try this and ensure they asked an officer about their oath (this is very important) then you'd be surprised. An experienced officer will know what it means when you ask them the question about their oath and common law. You're never going to be able to confront the police on a violent level unless you have the numbers, weapons and it will only ever be a small victory that won't last very long. So you have to *subvert to pervert*, and by that I mean start to constrain them with the very law they are there to *uphold*.

Everyone must remember that the police are public servants, not masters and as such are bound by the common law of this land. It's because of the public lack of knowledge about the laws that the police usually gain the upper-hand.

Personally I would like nothing more than a serious uprising in this country but it won't happen while the public sits in apathy, until such a time that people wake up, you have to try and use the system that they *enforce* against itself and this is one such method.

So it wouldn't be as efficient as just using a load of satellites, also you could position satellites closer to the sun so that the intensity is greater and then beam the energy back via a laser and reflective satellites.

I think Asimov or someone wrote about the possibility of such a system.

To be honest though I think that such projects would cost billions and billions and have countless practical problems - it might just be easier to invest in the mature tokamak line of fusion research of ITER etc., fusion power will also be necessary if we ever want to take large probes/ships to the far reaches of the solar system or to leave our dying luminary completely.

The lack of political will - really just a reflection of the myopic greed of those who have a lot of money and would have to contribute more via taxes etc. to pay for such a project or who would lose out if money was diverted from defence funds which currently defend their overseas interests - is certainly a massive issue in any energy investment though. Carter seemed to realise the importance of energy in his famous 'Crisis of Confidence' speech - since then it just seems to have been treated like the elephant in the room.

Good point about the satellites, but i think the moon concept only needs a small percentage of the panels to be exposed to the sun at any given time for it to provide all the energy we need. The added benefit is that it gives us a good reason to get to the moon and establish permanent bases there. Doing this is essential for conquering the rest of the solar system, because materials and fuels can be manufactured and used on the moon to build and fuel/refuel spaceships bound for the other planets.

true,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"Yeah, but the issue is that you'd still need to get a lot of people/materials to the moon/shipyard from the Earth. I'm not convinced that a moonbase would be that useful except for an observatory perhaps? But then satellites have greater mobility. Some suggested mining the moon for He-3 for fusion reactors but on the standard D-T cycle this isn't necessary and if we are dreaming about other fuel cycles we might as well hope for the far more energetic D-D cycle or the aneutronic p-B11 one, neither of which require He-3.

We need a much better way of escaping Earth's gravity well than chemical rocketry, and although my interest in Plasma Physics (stemming from Fusion) has introduced me to such ideas as the VASIMR propulsion system (which can replace chemical rockets once in space) there seems to be very few practical ideas for replacing chemical rockets to get off the Earth.

I think that it is much more likely that ships will be assembled in a modular fashion with a basic shipyard in LEO but really it will just be fitting pre-made modules together much as we have done with the ISS. I mean essentially you could just attach a load of thruster modules to the ISS and you have a spaceship.

I think if the Moon is exploited it will probably be for space tourism (which is still important) as who wouldn't want to walk on the lunar surface?

The sad thing is that the Proton launcher was the best launcher for probes and the choice to continue to use the Titan for probe launches just for political/economic reasons meant that they didn't have enough money to launch two Mars Observers (the Voyager, Viking, Vega etc. programmes always went in pairs so that if one broke the other could complete the mission), of course the Mars Observer then broke and as it didn't have a twin the mission was a massive failure.

true,wjw75,null,null,"What the officer did was really stupid, not least since the rest of this story is all a bit suspect, but now there's no way they can charge her. I think there's more to this than she's admitting to - like that she had in fact been drink driving.

Her behaviour makes a lot more sense then - drunken argument with husband late one night, storms out the house into her car, goes on a random drive down a country lane, parks up, blasts out a bit of Van Morrison, cranks the heaters up, passes out, then gets woken up by police in the morning. Attending female officer probably smellt alcohol on her breath, called for backup, they ask for a breath sample, she refuses.

Apparantly she can't remember being asked for a sample...in spite of the Department saying that she refused, not just the officer who hurt her.

So now they've taken her into custody, she's probably still a bit drunk, which explains her belligerent behaviour in the station - refusing to go into the cell in the first place, finally going in, then when a doctor came in to check on her (BEFORE she was thrown back into the cell and hurt her head) she just breezes right past him out of the cell. Even if you think you've been falsey arrested, or you don't agree with the reasons you've been arrested, you're still supposed to stay put so that things can be sorted out properly. It's certainly not something a 'mild-mannered' woman would do.

Compare this sequence of events to the contrived account she offers - an argument with a phone company over a bill apparantly left her so stressed that she spontaneously decided, at night, to make a 2-hour drive into London to stay with her daughter.

One long conversation later and she decides against this, but doesn't go back home? So it's at this point she reveals that she had a 'minor' argument with her partner.

Even her account of what the police said when they found her in her car is ridiculous. So we're meant to believe, that in sleepiest ruraliest Wiltshire, two officers pulled up next to a 59 year old woman's 'Mercedes estate', and greeted her with 'Shut up. We are the fucking police.'? I find that very hard to believe - it sounds a lot more like she's embellishing her story, to make excuses for her being 'angry and abusive' (her own admission).

Couple of other points, 
&gt;What's the job situation like in cities other than London?

If you're going to major in finance you'll probably want to be in London, you could work in regional offices but 90% (probably more) of financial firms have their headquarters in London, so its a good idea to at least start in London.  The job situation outside London is similar to inside London, there are less jobs but there are less people looking for them if anything I'd say its a little better.

&gt;London being a drain on the rest of England

Its where most big business goes, and tourists, but that's all. London's cool, and has a lot of brilliant things going for it, but its not the be all and end all, a lot of people who live there think it is.

&gt;London, everything I've heard indicates it's very expensive and crowded,

True and true, although to be honest, coming from the states everything is going to seem expensive, and depending on where you're from (i.e anywhere except New York) overcrowded too. If you work in London you will earn more than if you work out of London (companies will generally add 10-20% on to the salaries of employees in London), so it works out about the same overall

The fixed points are not really fixed.  They're just either very difficult to change or the consequences of the change could be disastrous.  Did you ever see that episode of Voyager with the timeship and the constant calculations of the future that results from changing certain events?  Imagine that the Time Lords did this, with a universe of time and space filled with time travellers, only they rarely interfered.  The Doctor didn't like this and set out on his own to influence events for the better.

At some point during the Last Great Time War, before Gallifrey was put into a Time Lock, they Time Lords probably had to decide on a certain ""history"" of the universe, at least in broad terms, since they would no longer be around to modify it from time to time.  Certain events are probably so important to the progress of human history that they are essentially ""fixed""; changing what happens on Mars could change the future of human history to such a large degree that it's almost unthinkable.

Of course, the post-Time Lord universe is still filled with time travel and thus even ""fixed"" points are still at times in jeapordy.

http://www.ukvisas.gov.uk/en/howtoapply/infs/

A good option to consider is transferring your credits and getting your actual degree from a UK university.  At that point, you'll qualify for the 2 year post-study visa, and from there it is a simple step to upgrade to a full 5 year visa.  The advantage of the UK's Points-Based system is you do not need sponsorship from an organisation to remain in the country.  

I moved here from California 2 years ago in order to get my master's degree.  When I finished, I moved to London, got a job (about 3 months ago), and I'm getting my house in order to upgrade my current visa to a 5 year one.  The immigration process is relatively painless.  Getting a visa as a student is simple once you've been accepted into university.  

I like living in London.  I'd never lived in an urban setting before.  My undergraduate degree was from UC Davis, small college town, and I grew up in the suburbs.  I did my post-grad at University of Warwick, which is technically in Coventry, but everyone pretends it's not. 

Overall, it's quite an easy move to get here.  Especially as a student.  If you get your degree from a non-UK university, it becomes a bit more difficult.  The Highly-skilled migrant programme (Tier 1) is fantastic if you meet the criteria, but at your age, you won't have the income to allow a sponsorship free journey.  If you're serious about moving here, for an extended period, consider transferring to a UK university.  It'll be easier to stay then.

I don't think your solution is ""simple"".  For a good part they have his spacesuit and wouldn't have believed some story about saving them all in the TARDIS.  Later on, things are pretty hectic and the place is already in danger; sticking around to evacuate these people himself who supposedly died puts his own life at risk.  And there's no guarantee simply stranding them on an alien planet would prevent major contamination of the timeline.

Plus, I think that's rather cruel.  If you're a time traveller, everyone you meet eventually dies.  It's rather presumptuous to think you should ""save"" (but not really) everyone you see who is about to die and strand them somewhere in the remote mists of time and space; I don't think that's much better for them, and highly impractical from a time traveller's standpoint, anyway.

All that said, the UK isn't the best place to move for uni or work at the moment.

If you're to live in the UK, it would have to be London as it is economically and culturally far ahead of the rest of the UK. I lived up north as a kid, northern people tend to be far nicer and friendlier than southerners but it can be very depressing, cold, miserable, poor; because of Thatcher single-handedly destroying the working class of England. London though, as you said, is very, very expensive, if you want to live in a good, safe, central area in a well looked after flat, you're looking at spending about £700GBP a month minimum if you share. £500 for a shit-hole in an average area, you could get a room for £300 or less if you don't want to walk around at night. Finding a flat in London is absolutely soul-destroying (see the UK and London reddit's to read many-a-woeful tale), everything is either really expensive, horrible or has 10 people competing for it. The infrastructure of London is crumbling under the weight of millions of migrants draining all of the resources, don't read that the wrong way, I was one of those migrants also. Getting a doctors appointment can be very difficult, drop-in centers are understaffed and overworked and inefficient. Internet connections top-out at about 6mb, 2 different people get 0.5mb. Buses are crowded. Violence on the street is all too common and many people will say London is not the best place for meeting new people.

That said, I adore London, it is one of my favourite cities, it is buzzing with excitement, it has shit-tonnes of energy, equal to NYC, London is one step ahead of the world in terms of every trend, and there is always something awesome going on.

This is off-topic for a UK thread, but, If you're feeling even more adventurous, a lot of students choose Berlin, the fees for uni are low, the courses are cheap (and mostly in English), visa entry requirements are lax for Americans, apartment rent is cheap (you can get a nice one bed apartment for 350 euros a month), you get many of the benefits that you do in many EU countries (heavily subsidised healthcare, free for students), Berlin is very cool, safe, full of people from all over europe and the world and very, very cheap. If you ever wanna check it out, my sofa-bed is always available for a fellow redditor to crash on. If I were still in London, I'd make you the same offer.

Assuming this is just for WBA.


The team you posted is horribly unbalanced, especially for an away fixture. Huddlestone has been our best holding midfielder and is generally needed to cover Palacios who wanders out of position if left on his own in the middle. VDV hasn't even met most of the squad yet and plays best in the middle, not on the left.


For a long term best XI, at home we'll probably still play 4-4-2 with Huddlestone, Modrić in the middle, Lennon/VdV on the wings (VdV playing the drifting role Modrić played when he was on the wing). Away we'll go 4-5-1 Modrić and Huddlestone holding, Lennon and Bale on the wings and VdV in the middle.

&gt; 
&gt; ""Of course I can regenerate again, who's to say I can't?""

That would be difficult, since the only way a companion these days would know about the limit is if the Doctor told them, and if he's going to say it's no longer true then he wouldn't have said so to begin with.  I suppose someone who knew something of Time Lord history might know but it would be a very long shot.

&gt; It always seemed to me that if the Timelords could grant new ones, then the limit was their own imposition.

Yes, but that doesn't mean they had to personall ""prevent"" someone from regenerating at the last time; it's just that whatever magic that allows regenerations only allows 12, and if you want more you have to get more from the Time Lords.  The Doctor certainly didn't know how to get them himself (that is what the Valeyard was seeking) so it's some hidden knowledge that only someone like the President is privy to (the Doctor never stayed President long enough to stick around and read ancient documents on this), or perhaps requiring the actions of several Time Lords in concert.

&gt; Didn't the Troughton's Doctor say something to the effect that Timelords could potentially live indefinitely.

Yes, but that's probably because it doesn't seem like they're forced to regenerate because of old age, although a case could be made that the First Doctor's body was going to require a regeneration anyway after 500+ years just to keep active and alert.  In any case, we know from subsequent material that the Time Lords didn't just hand out new regenerative cycles easily; plenty of Time Lords die after their 13th body.

In this scenario, he will manipulate more dreams along the way, not only the Doctor's and his companions, but River Song, and perhaps the Doctor's enemies along the way.  

I think the Valeyard will actually come about as a sort of metacrisis created in the Doctor's 12th regeneration (perhaps one created by the Dream Lord's own designs and manipulations).  A true physical form for the Dream Lord by way of metacrisis = birth of the Valeyard.  This fits what we know about the Valeyard from the Colin Baker days perfectly.

As a side note, I also think the black TARDIS in the Lodger was something the Valeyard/Dream Lord may have created somewhere along the (future) way.

Ultimately, the Valeyard knows what the Doctor knows.  This is Doctor's way to break the time lock--it is already established that the Valeyard arrives in the Sixth Doctor's time, and that he ultimately ends up with his mind placed in the Matrix.  Inside the Matrix, he will exist with all the Doctor's knowledge of how the Time War panned out.  Inside the Matrix, he can also advise the Master or Romana or anyone else who will listen as to what can be done to end the Time War.

I owe a lot to the NHS, I would never swap the NHS for the US system, being scared that I could be put into life-crippling debt at the whim of a for-profit insurance company at any point is not what I think the healthcare system of a developed country should deliver.

The NHS has saved by life and many around me, and also nursed me back to wellness on numerous occasions throughout my life, the service always for free, and the treatments capped at the princely sum of £7.06.

My main critisism of the NHS is that sometimes I've had to wait quite long to see specialists, once 2 months to see an ear specialist and another time around 3 months to see a skin specialist, none of these where life threatening of course but indicative of a lack of certain specialists.

I don't think ether the US or UK systems are best out there, I would take the UK system over the US system any day. Systems like the Japanese and German systems I think are the best (I live in Germany now). In Germany, like now in the States, you must have health insurance, the difference being however that your healthcare is paid for by the state or heavily subsidised if you're unemployed, retired a student or on a low income. Your employer must contribute towards your healthcare costs. You do have to pay to see a specialist, but you can go straight to a specialist at any time, the cost is capped at 10 euros, if you see that specialist again within the following three months you won't have to pay again.

**tl:dr** The UK system is great, it isn't the best but I would take it over the US system any day.

Behold LostRiot's higher education system

We don't need a load of people with business studies degrees, Univeristy qualifications should fill one of three holes.

1. Vocational - but only for jobs where a high level of skill/knowledge is required, i.e. Doctors and accountancy. Sports therapy should not be done at universities. 

2. Academic - i.e. subjects that are important for culture and society in the UK and will lead to research or academic roles. i.e. History and physics

3. Both - i.e. Chemisty or computer science - it can go either way. English lit can not go either way.

Now, this is when things get interesting. I believe that about 90% of people who go to crappy ex-poly's and do courses like surf science do this largely because they want to go to university, leave home, drink, shag and have fun. This is fine, but at the moment these people aren't benefiting anyone.

So I think you take all the things like NVQs and 'potato studies' courses and you put them in all the ex poly's and you let people get student loans, and go study them, essentially at university. You subsidise things we need more of, in the same way that teaching is subsidised. So plumbing, for example, would be free (or you get a refund on completion), but other courses would not. 

This would mean that if someone really wants to study an academic subject, they go to university and do it, but its hard to get in and standards are high.

If someone wants to be a student and wants to make sure they have a job to walk into afterwards they go to other type of institution, and do something that will help them do that.

true,akz08,null,null,"Sadly, due to the recent cuts, London universities (at least) have been axing down the Humanities departments. Being in Imperial College where the focus is heavily on teaching STEM and research, I found it quite fulfilling taking a language as a side-subject. 

I was unable to take it for credit in my year of study (for credit is paid for by the university) I paid some £170 for a proper course in Japanese. However, following the funding cut, a good number of Humanities staff were laid off. To add further insult, Japanese, Arabic and Russian are no longer available for credit. I don't know about Russian, but the Japanese and Arabic courses are immensely popular, but I suppose were cut due to the University not seeing the 'academic value' for them, leaving European languages and Mandarin available for study. Even then, only level 2 in those languages can be taken for credit. 

Now, you may be saying that yes, those languages are indeed of more value, but now non-credit (language) courses are a full blown £250. So unless you studied the language before till GCSEs, or really crazy about it, you're unlikely to even take up a new language. 

Since I rather fancy improving my Japanese and can afford it, I've signed up for next year. Even then, it depends on if there are enough people. I'll probably switch it to Mandarin level 1 though. That being said, it hinders a large majority of students who want solace from the rigorous STEM courses we take. 

And that's just languages. I have no idea how it has affected the rest of Humanities.

Though I agree that most people won't want to add further work to our already big-enough workload, this discourages those who are willing to broaden their minds a bit more (via language).

http://www.themindrobber.co.uk/ratings.html

13 million was the peak for the new series and an average would sit at something like 8.5 million.

It is worth noting that this doesn't include BBC iPlayer figures. The BBC iPlayer is like Hulu but for BBC content. A lot of people use the BBC iPlayer for their Doctor Who fix because in Britain if you own a TV you have to pay a TV license fee. A lot of people(generally students) avoid the extra tax by using the BBC iPlayer service on their laptops.

All in all taking everything into account Doctor Who is one of the most popular shows when it is airing. He is as iconic as Bond or Sherlock Holmes in Britain.

13 million viewers by English standards is nearly a quarter of the nation so he gets a pretty huge start.

Events surrounding Doctor Who also do very well and there is a monthly doctor who magazine as well as a few comic books.


The last example is the most interesting though. In the new season of Doctor Who the Doctor adopts a bow tie and says they are cool. The effect is that the sale of bow ties went up 94%:

As for susbcription numbers of the cable and satellite companies. Well I would wager Britain has some of the highest cable and satellite subscriptions per person on the planet. Nearly everybody has a sky or virgin media sub.

In Britain the most popular sport is football and clubs like Manchester United and Liverpool have the kind of rabid support that could cause wars that would make world war 2 look like a day at the beach. Even though the sports packages are extremely expensive a lot of people buy them(which is why some of the biggest sports entities on the planet are British despite it being a small country.


If you look at most British shows the ratings are generally quite low. Some of the more popular TV shows in the last decade were Ideal and Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps.

Shows like that generally get ratings in line with what you would expect.

If you look at the most popular shows in Britain though they have been around for a while. Top Gear is another show that routinely gets very high ratings. Top Gear is a very old show. The new show launched in 2001 but the old show was on during the 80's.

In Britain a lot of shows don't really go away they stay around for more than one generation and that next generation picks up on it. My grandfather was an avid fan of Doctor Who in the 60's. He passed on sometime around then but he introduced my dad to the Doctor. I wasn't born till the 80's but I can remember my dad introducing me to Doctor Who. I remember my whole family used to sit around to watch it.

Now my sister watches it with her daughter who is too young to really understand it. I've turned my brother onto it and he turned his friends onto it.

A large part of the success of shows like Doctor Who is that they have been around for so long and word of mouth has carried them so far. Apart from a few key shows like Doctor Who or Top Gear the ratings for most shows are quite low and inline with most other countries.

The only new shows that get 8 or 10 million viewers are the documentaries the BBC shoots but the BBC also has a long heritage of nature documentaries and again a lot of kids grew up watching them and pass them onto their kids.",0,1284003749,null,0,false,0,c0yy6ei,t3_db2u5,t1_c0yy6ei,t1_c0yw556,null,1426459386,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Cameras in the house. Thats what waivers are for after the event. His family/gf gave permission. I'm sure if he was cracking one off they'd ignore it and the gf can give them a heads up (she may have had the ability to turn them off).

External cameras were hidden inside cars/vans, you could see the occasional reflection from the windows. 

No copilot. For someone who hasnt been in a plane since he was 13, he may not have really studied the subject, and probably didnt know that it was standard to have two. He also didnt spot that the captain was sitting in the first officers seat (but possibly many others didnt).

He was selected from a group of 150 potentials, all of whom were picked because of their ability to be hypnotised quickly or extremely suggestible (Guardian comments confirm this). Having seen him live, I'm fairly certain he's good at hypnotism.

There's also something about attitude - both mine and those of people who remained behind.

Similarly, scientists don't make a terrible fuss - they write a few articles here and there (there might be the odd protest if there is a department closure, but if the government can ignore millions protesting the Iraq war, they can ignore this) and then by and large the scientists are simply forced to move abroad to continue their research wherever they can find funding. 

Unlike the bankers and businessmen they don't just sit and threaten to leave and get all their threats published as front page news - instead they just go. Due to the economies poor health after WWII and the relative prosperity of the United States, the Brain Drain began in the fifties - it was then made a pretty permanent fixture after the Thatcher cuts to science funding and with these latest cuts it seems that British science will decline further still.

Perhaps most worrying are the cuts to the research councils which will lead to an entire generation of would-be PhD's and post-docs being unable to find positions and perhaps leaving science altogether. 

I am sure that the situation is not helped by the fact that there are very few Ministers in Parliament with even a decent undergraduate science education let alone PhDs or professional scientists.

His point about children's books with ""adult covers"" is probably a jab at Harry Potter, and in this I can sympathize, even as someone who himself got the adult cover, ""special edition"" UK versions of the books.

true,weblypistol,cnty-uk,Llanfairpwllgwyngyll.... etc.,"America is more traditionally centered on individual liberty and Europe about collectivity and a balance of competing rights. It's not as black and white as that, and the past decades have seen a world shift to the right, especially with the demise of communism and erosion of socialism/rise of the market paradigm. It's why the ""there is no such thing as society "" thing caused a fuss. Similar arguments occur with regard to free speech and whether it is absolute or to be managed with regard to competing rights. It's an old problem that Mill, Bentham, Paine, Kant, Marx, and many others have struggled with. I'm not going to solve it against the likes of them in a reddit thread.

So, I'm more in tune with a balance of rights rather than strict individual liberty, though a right wing perspective would probably argue for the use of courts as a remedy not government. There are merits to both sides. Personally, and in this example, the leylandii guy is bang out of order and is infringing on others

First of all these trees are enormous, towering almost 10ft above his house. It is monstrous, there is rights to your property, and there is 30ft tall dense leylandii trees.

When you hear the previous episode of his story it get's very interesting.

This chap, we shall call him Treeman (no relation to /r/trees), is a Civil/Building engineer by trade. A few years ago Treeman built an 8ft high wall around his back garden, naturally his neighbours complained that it was illegal etc., although he had very cleverly read his deeds/local planning laws and, technically his wall was completely legal.

By building the wall approx 1ft. inside his garden it was not, strictly, a ""boundary"" wall, and thus not banned by deeds, and as it didn't have a roof etc. not banned by planning laws.

Now, the only way his neighbours managed to get him to tear down this wall (Mr Gorbachev) was to take him to the Magistrates under nuisance etc. laws.

Now I can see the American's points and agree with OP that they have far more land than us, and yes, we should be able to do what we want, but seriously, Treeman, cut down your trees. There is a line and it's quite clear that he crossed it.

It berates the British web industry for not having a bigger presence, but the data it uses to back up this statement is skewed beyond comprehension.

Firstly, it excludes all British '*entities that have a bigger offline presence such as the BBC, websites of banks or national UK papers*', yet lists rightmove as the top British website (excluding those previously mentioned) as 1,118th (or maybe 1,112, depending on which paragraph you read) on a list of websites that ***includes* all websites, irrespective of whether they have a bigger offline presence or not** as proof.


To be consistent, they have to either *exclude* all worldwide websites with a larger offline presence, or *include* all British websites with a larger off-line presence.

If you use the comparison list as a base (ie *all websites, irrespective of off-line presence*), then the BBC comes in as 45th, which is quite a bit better than 1,118th (or possibly 1,112th).

Also worth noting is the fact that, of the 44 sites listed above the BBC, **10** of them are regional google sites, and should count as one site - if I type in google.com, I'm automatically redirected to google.co.uk (does this register a hit for both google.com and google.co.uk?). Also on the subject of google, my homepage is google, but it doesn't mean I actually use it every time I open Firefox, even though it is registered as a 'hit'. How many other websites on this list receive the ranking they have because of this 'homepage' factor?

Also, I don't understand the use of this phrase:

&gt;This means the Digital Economy Bill doesn’t mean shit about actually having a tech industry, and more just about catching copyright pirates.

Well, duh! That's the whole point of the DEB, and always has been. It is not disguised as anything else. I don't think this website understands the arguments for *or* against the DEB, and fails in what it is trying to say, even though it may have had a valid argument to begin with (lack of UK-based websites).

true,sirbruce,null,null,"The real answer is that the Doctor was already established as being very old if nor immortal during his first incarnation, before they even considered regeneraiton. The second Doctor he declared he was about 450.  It was only during the 4th Doctor that it was established there were only 12 regenerations.

There was certainly a time period when it was possible to speculate that the Doctor had more regenerations before his first TV appearance, but events in the new series have definitively ruled that out, unless the Time Lords gave the Doctor a set of extra regenerations way in the past after he used up his first set.  So there's no reason to believe that.

So, yes, his first incarnation lived 450 years or so before his first regeneration.  This makes sense; the majority of that time was spent living in the safety of Gallifrey, and Time Lords are effectively immortal barring accidents.  It's important to note that his body was rather weak after 450 years, so it seems likely that Time Lords may regenerate anyway after a few hundred years just to keep active and refreshed.

Although we have ~40 years of Doctor Who stories, it's interesting to note that he's aged hundreds of years during that time.  So The Doctor has a lot of adventures ""off screen"" that we never see, perhaps spending decades alone by himself.

Or, alternatively, the Doctor lies.

People who want to buy a Redditch shirt/merchandise (when the eBay shop is up and running) are helping to secure the future of the club, and helping to increase our playing budget - thus bringing in a better calibre of players.
You don't even have to buy anything to support the club, the interest and enthusiasm shown on here does find it's way back to the club and is discussed amongst fans on the terraces, and it does a hell of a lot for morale.
Everyone at the Reds are fully aware of our Reddit-based Redditch supporters, and we value them greatly.

By the way we'll be 20th very soon, as Ilkeston Town have been wound up over a debt of £50k. So the point Hyde United gained from the draw with Ilkeston will be expunged putting them on 0 points and bottom ;). Now you can see why we have to live within our means on such a low budget to avoid going down the same road.

To be fair, Reddit were unlucky not to have a different name that rhymed with a more successful club! But you've chosen to adopt us and this is Redditch for you.
-The lowest playing budget in the league (and even most teams from the divisions below)
-Arguably one of the worst pitches in the league.
-Based in a very stubborn town, who's population is touching around the 95,000 mark - yet struggle to attract 0.5% of that to home games! (although attendances are slowly increasing)

Things are on the up though. It may not seem like it due to our run of results, but off the pitch things are moving rapidly in the right direction and this will benefit what happens on the pitch in the near future.
Our objective for this season is to stay up, nothing more nothing less and if we manage this it will be a great achievement given the resources we have to work with.
It's a very slow progress, but if we can survive another season or two in this division then I seriously think we have the potentially to climb the table.
Playing budgets will increase, better performances/results, attracts more fans etc. etc...
Stick with us guys, and thanks again for your support!

true,ocealot,scottish,Glasgow,"&gt;It worked pretty well in Spain during the revolution. George Orwell fought in Spain alongside anarchists and Marxists, and wrote a book about it. He described his experience as:

&gt;""I had dropped more or less by chance into the only community of any size in Western Europe where political consciousness and disbelief in capitalism were more normal than their opposites. Up here in Aragon one was among tens of thousands of people, mainly though not entirely of working-class origin, all living at the same level and mingling on terms of equality. In theory it was perfect equality, and even in practice it was not far from it. There is a sense in which it would be true to say that one was experiencing a foretaste of Socialism, by which I mean that the prevailing mental atmosphere was that of Socialism. Many of the normal motives of civilized life--snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc.--had simply ceased to exist. The ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England; there was no one there except the peasants and ourselves, and no one owned anyone else as his master.""

&gt;The wiki article on Spain during the revolution goes on to say:

&gt;""The anarchist held areas were run according to the basic principle of ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his need."" In some places, money was entirely eliminated, to be replaced with vouchers. Under this system, goods were often up to a quarter of their previous cost.

&gt;Despite the critics clamoring for maximum efficiency, anarchic communes often produced more than before the collectivization. The newly liberated zones worked on entirely libertarian principles; decisions were made through councils of ordinary citizens without any sort of bureaucracy. (The CNT-FAI leadership was at this time not nearly as radical as the rank and file members responsible for these sweeping changes.)

&gt;In addition to the economic revolution, there was a spirit of cultural revolution. Oppressive traditions were done away with. For instance, women were allowed to have abortions, and the idea of ""free love"" became popular. In many ways, this spirit of cultural liberation was similar to that of the ""New Left"" movements of the 1960s.""

&gt;I'd say that not only do humans work like that, but, in fact, they worked like that extremely well.

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"I am aware that we don't live in Albania. I am also aware that there is a huge disparity in incomes in this country and huge pockets of poverty (actual poverty... not that 'well they've all got flat screen tellies and have money for fags' type poverty that some sections of the press are so fond of). And I don't think anyone here is arguing that the state should create 'all the jobs'. However, the state is needed to stimulate demand (and a sure fire way of doing that is by creating jobs, which requires state money), otherwise who will buy the goods and services we produce? Europe? I think they've got enough on their plate right now and are in a very similar position to us (except that governments on the continent are far less averse to directly aiding industry). The US? Nah. That means going toe-to-toe with dirt cheap far eastern imports and their own industrial output, neither of which is a very inticing prospect. Internal demand? Well, in order for that to happen, people need money. If it doesn't come from the state, that money either needs to come from an economy that pays well enough to allow people to buy the good, or from credit, which is the way it was operating but isn't anymore. Yes, there will be some niche areas where we could do quite well in, but not well enough to generate employment on the scale required.

 So the choice is this: Either the private sector radically changes its ways and starts paying people wages that have some semblance of reality, or the state takes up the slack.

Yeah this is basically my thoughts.

To be honest as long as there are massive job losses I'll be happy.

Also post offices need to be updated too I have two problems, one is having to queue for ages with all the benefits people when all you want to do is post a parcel, the other is getting a red card, having to wait 3 days to pick up the parcel and having to go at stupid times because they have crazy opening hours. Two easy ways to solve this

* Why can't we have post boxes that take parcels. You could easily set up a system where you put a parcel in a box (bank deposit style), it weighs and measures it and then you stick in the money, put one in every village. Problem of closing post offices sorted and I'm sure even with the cost of buying/building the equipment this would be cheaper that a PO.

* Random code on red card opens locker in a collection office which is situated at a location close to the end of the postman's round. Get red card, go to locker, pick up parcel. Save money on not employing some dunce to stand at the counter all day and also means you don't have to transport the parcels from the post office that the postman ends his round at to the sorting office (which is what takes 2 or 3 days)",0,1284132569,null,0,false,0,c0z33i9,t3_dc18v,t1_c0z33i9,t1_c0z30wr,null,1426461704,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,syuk,ter-Sark,Sark,"The reality of the scenario is that we are coming to a situation where the middle classes who work are worse off than career benefit families who don't, that is what has fucked the north of england.

When you have uncles teaching nephews how to game the system, aunties teaching nieces how having a child will get them X then it is broken.

Private sector can't change its ways due to many reasons and only pay a living wage, an existing wage should I say at £6.40 or whatever it is an hour that is minimum wage. The biggest eye opener is seeing many are actually better of on benefits than having a job, meanwhile the state pays for education many have no interest in or will ever use.

The country is fucked, if you don't have any money now, you won't have any later. The middle class is paying for most of the state supported benefits as they can't get dodge rates like the rich can.

It is very depressing but it seems like the previous government tried to reduce everyone to the same level, essentialy by taking from those who actually go to work to pay those who sit it in front of 52'' TVs all day watching jeremy kyle and grow weed in the attic on council leccy spitting out kids inbetween.

There has to be some kind of clean up or this is going to end very badly for a lot of people in the north.

PS I am not richard littlejohn, nor a mail reader, I see a lot of this first hand.
