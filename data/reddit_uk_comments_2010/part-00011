Doctor Who first appeared on BBC television at 17:15 GMT on 23 November 1963

And of course we all know thet The Doctor stole his Type 40
In the programme, the Doctor's TARDIS is an obsolete Type 40 TT capsule (presumably TT stands for ""time travel"") that he unofficially ""borrowed"" when he departed his home planet of Gallifrey. According to the Eighth Doctor Adventures novel The Gallifrey Chronicles  by Lance Parkin, it previously belonged to a Time Lord named Marnal, who was, like the Doctor, something of a renegade. By the time of The Pirate Planet, the Doctor had been travelling onboard in time and space for 523 years

[I was disappointed at the scope of this episode. I was hoping that this episode would tie into the cracks of the Universe and the Doctor's belief that the root cause of the cracks is Amy's wedding day. I thought perhaps that the first crack was created by the Doctor taking Amy away when she was meant to marry Rory, and that the Dream Lord was some way for the Universe to force Amy to make a choice so that the paradox of her living on the TARDIS and possibly never coming back to get married could be resolved.

Also, Amy didn't make a choice. She killed herself in a moment of emotional turmoil after the man she believed was her husband died. It doesn't prove that she really wanted to choose her life with Rory over The Doctor so much as that she loves Rory.

Basically, I was disappointed because I think that the episode had built itself up to be a major piece of the plot and it had nothing to do with the overarching plot of this series, and I was also disappointed because we learned nothing new about the characters and none of their stories was moved forward in this episode.](/spoiler)

true,mistyriver,null,null,"The UK is a very densely populated country. I live in the USA, and I grew up in the city of Seattle. I have lived for many years in a little tourist/college town of about 15,000 people. I would never want to live in a big city again - because I'm a poor person. There is this inequality in lifestyle between the rich and the poor in a city, to where those of meager means only see the foul armpit of the city. The poor don't get to work in the tall skyscrapers and see the view of the harbor; they walk through the dirty dark wind tunnels at the foot of the tall buildings. The poor don't get to hold garden parties on beachfront property. The poor can't even afford to enjoy the cultural offerings of a big city.

In a small town, everyone has access to all the benefits the town has to offer. I live cheaply in a loft apartment in a victorian style house. I volunteer as a board member of a local community theater company. I sang the lead in a Gilbert and Sullivan play last year. You can get lunch at most of the local restaurants for $12 or so. All of the ornate downtown area is yours to enjoy - no matter what income you have.

Of course, there aren't many opportunities to make money in a small town. You have people with advanced degrees in all kinds of areas waiting tables at local restaurants.  Ideally, one would find a way to freelance over the internet. 

So observing this difference between city life and small town life - this brings me to that assertion that it's not the politicians' fault that there are social inequalities. It's how the people themselves have chosen to organize their communities. Government is peripheral to people's lives.

[Also, I can't really see any articles he presents himself with that other doctors haven't typically worn, with two exceptions - the race car driver's suit and the butcher's outfit although with the latter it looks like he's just wearing coveralls over top of the suit and jacket from 12:58 (see link below).](/spoiler)

[His outfits line up almost precisely with the doctor's mental state at the time. On the TARDIS he feels at home and himself, hence the ""Dream Lord"" is dressed as he is. When he's racing to save Amy and Rory, the Dream Lord appears in a race driver's outfit. When he's laying out the rules he looks like William Hartnell almost.](/spoiler)

[Interestingly in the same scene he changes wardrobes to reflect the doctor's change in status. The scene where he chooses not to knock Amy out he starts out wearing the poncho while the Doctor is conscious, and then seamlessly switches when the Doctor switches worlds. Link Below.](/spoiler)

Sure, there is more likely to be an MP around who I voted for, but if four of them are duff, one has to do five MP's work.

For the House of Commons, you vote for a candidate, not a party. The party is there so that the party with the majority can all vote together to form a Government - or that's how I understand it.

Also, these people are talking about having an elected House of Lords - why would I want *two* elected Houses? I like the fact that the House of Lords is not swayed by popular opinion, and that for the most part they vote freely. I don't like how it's all hereditary, and I'd quite like a jury system where a random selection of 1000 people get shipped the bill under consideration and vote to accept it or return it. However, I'm willing to keep it as is - and it doesn't bother me in the slightest that some of these people are ""Captains of Industry"", criminals, not in touch with a political part or in charge of all their faculties.

Furthermore, it troubles me greatly that they're so emphatic about getting rid of the House of Lords and instituting electoral reform, but don't seem to have a problem with ""Royal Assent"". It doesn't matter that the Queen ""would never dream of saying no"".

“Changing the Westminster voting system, more or less radically, is now on the political agenda. So too is a much broader look at reforming institutions. And here all three main parties agree on a lot . . .""

That must be the greatest understatement of all time.

What the three main parties – indeed almost all professional politicians – agree upon is that political power should continue to be monopolised by . . . . professional politicians.

But at what point in the entire history of Britain did the People ever express their preference, in a referendum, to have all legislative and executive power delegated to and monopolised by these (so-called) ""representatives""?

Is it Divinely ordained that government be organised thus? (If so, to quote John Locke, its supporters ""ought to show us this charter from heaven, and let us see . . ."").

Can it be demonstrated that the acquiescence of the People towards the existing system of non-democratic government reflects implied consent? Can it be demonstrated that such acquiescence is not merely the ""dominant strategy"" adopted by individuals operating under conditions of Prisoner's Dilemma in the face of heavily entrenched and well-funded political parties savagely opposed to the introduction of Democracy?

In the absence of Divine Authority, in the absence of an authorising referendum, in the absence of demonstrable implied consent (and excluding is-ought fallacies, argumentum ad baculum, fallacies of irrelevance, and all the other illogicalities by which politicians attempt to justify themselves) by what principle did these (so-called) ""representatives"" acquire their supposed right to govern?

Why have the People never been given the option of choosing - in a free referendum in which the available options have not been pre-vetted by entrenched politicians - a democratic form of government for their country? Also, if Democracy is such an undesirable system of government, why is it that the Swiss, for example, have not used their democratic rights to abolish Democracy???

And finally, in the event that answers these questions (including this question) are provided in the form of statements of personal opinion, by what objective principle might those personal opinions be privileged over the opinions of other people (including in particular people who might support the introduction of Democracy were it ever to be put to a referendum)? And, in the absence of such an objective principle, by what objective principle do those non-democratic opinions prevail?

It is not inconceivable that the People - if ever they were allowed to choose their system of government in a referendum in which the options had not been vetted by self-serving politicians - would choose to invest representatives with a monopoly on power.

However, as a matter of historical record we may observe that:

a) no such referendum has ever been held in Britain;

b) where people have been given the choice (for example, in Switzerland or in those states of the US which enjoy the right of initiative) they choose Democracy – typically to the greatest extent offered to them; and

c) where people have Democracy, they do not use their democratic rights to abolish it - even though it is a straightforward matter to call a referendum to do so.

So why have the People of Britain never been permitted to choose for themselves whether (or not) they prefer a different system?

It is, after all, their country . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . isn’t it?????'",0,1274124279,null,0,false,0,c0q70k7,t3_c53i3,t1_c0q70k7,t1_c0q68yu,null,1426310546,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

* The constituencies have to be much larger. Given that our constituencies are already too small (there already aren't enough seats in the commons for all our MPs to fit), this would be quite a change.
* There would have to be a comprehensive boundary review (which would make it unlikely to be used if the coalition collapses early)
* You lose the connection to your local MP, because you have many.
* It's complicated. There's lots of candidates on your ballot form and it's difficult to understands how the the winners are allocated. And that's not just me, the commission said that (I'm paraphrasing, but not much).

I think AV is a reasonable compromise for the time being, which should result in more coalition governments and generally more reasonable politics. It has the big advantage that it is realistically achievable from a political perspective. STV hasn't got a snowball's chance in hell of getting through Parliament.

Larger geographic ridings are totally workable and we prove that this is the case on a daily basis here in Canada.  So, forgive me, but it's a bit rich and frankly laughable for a Brit to be complaining to a Canadian about constituencies getting ""much larger"".  

I don't think the complexity argument holds any water either.  I saw this argument creep up when the Canadian province of British Columbia was having a referendum on STV a couple of years ago and it made no sense to me then either.  STV has worked without any serious flaw or demonstrable lack of public understanding in Malta or Ireland for the better part of a century.  In my mind this argument boils down to arguing that some people (ex. Brits or British Columbians) are dumber than the Irish and the Maltese and thus are too stupid to understand STV in order to make it work.  If you want to make that argument, then that's fine.  But I wouldn't count on it being a winning campaign strategy.

Lastly, with STV I'd argue you actually *gain* connection to your local MP.  If you live in a safe riding where the local candidate could hold puppy-kicking contests on the first Tuesday of every month and still get elected, then what incentive does she have to assist you?  Furthermore, if you live in a, for example, safe Tory riding and you require assistance with a problem you're having regarding your same-sex partner, do you really think you'll feel any sort of a connection to your local Tory MP?  Conversely, if you have multiple MPs, there's an extra incentive for them to either a) not piss you off because you can always vote for a *different* candidate from the same party; or b) there often can be an extra incentive for MPs to help constituents who have been turned away by one of their rival MPs because then it serves as a double PR victory.

Someone once put it that the Tenth Doctor took people on a grand adventure through time and space while the Eleventh is a madman careening around the universe in a box; the Ninth tends much more towards the former description. I mean, the first stop for Rose is the end of the world, and the overarching theme of that season is ""everything dies; everything must come to dust"", and Nine is so much more obviously haunted by the Time War. I tend to think of the Eighth Doctor as having ended the War and suffering the direct PTSD, the Ninth as trying to suppress the memories and ending up alternately abrasive and overly jokey, the Tenth Doctor as being more emotionally pornographic, bringing himself to catharsis, and the Eleventh Doctor as more fully functional after a particularly violent regeneration, though with underlying self-hatred that's only subtly brought to the surface (e.g. Dream Lord).

Admittedly, none of the first halves of the first four seasons were particularly good, and the 2005 season was either the best or second best of those, so I'm probably being a bit unfair. Nevertheless, I feel like the new episodes are not only more solid but more whimsical. *The Eleventh Hour*, in particular, opened with ten minutes of horseplay, setting the most eccentric doctor since Four up against a brilliantly-played Scottish girl and a cupboardful of food and went on to give us Crowning Moments of Awesome, Funny, and Heartwarming almost without interruption to the final minutes. Matt Smith and Karen Gillan have an extraordinarily good chemistry and comic timing together: the bickering and mimicking behind ""What I always do: stay out of trouble! ...badly."", Amy's three-second gamut of facial expressions at ""But... it didn't make the noise"", the entire farce ending *Flesh and Stone*, the added dynamic of Rory sending every single interaction into a tailspin.

I don't know; maybe it's just different types of humour at work. In which case, we'll never settle it—everyone has their favourite Doctor, and if yours is Eccleston, that's absolutely fan*tas*tic! :-D",0,1274197857,null,0,false,0,c0q93ta,t3_c5iol,t1_c0q93ta,t3_c5iol,null,1426311541,24,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,24

As for the 'reboot' of the series, I'm not so sure. Both Smith and Gillan have been confirmed for another series, so any reboot would probably not happen this year.

That said, the Dream Lord (being the dark half of the Doctor) is very similar to The Valeyard, who is meant to turn up between the twelfth and final incarnation of the Doctor. As there are only meant to be twelve regenerations (or thirteen Doctors), this is certainly something they have to address, and soon.

Personally, I've always had a sneaking suspicion (or maybe hope), that the thirteenth and final incarnation will find a way back to Gallifrey before the Time Lord's existed, and meets up with Omega and Rassilon, to begin it all again as The Other.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"Sigh.  When I was at Uni, 20-odd years ago, I marched for ""Grants, not loans!""  I think I've still got the T-shirt somewhere...

For those who are too young to remember, we didn't have tuition fees back then.  Anyone who wasn't ""well off"" had their tuition fees paid, accommodation allowance, and a personal allowance for food, books, beer, etc.  My parents were ""well off"" enough for me not to qualify, but then it wasn't a struggle for them to cover my living expenses, books, etc, so it seemed pretty fair.  I still got all my tuition fees paid.

If you also had a part-time job, say working in a bar a few nights a week, then you could get by pretty well.  Sure, most people left with a hefty overdraft, but we're only talking a few thousand here or there (although that was old money, but probably &lt;10k in today's money).

Then Thatcher effectively abolished student grants and replaced them with loans.  At first they were just ""top-up loans"" offering students a better interest rate than their bank was charging them for an overdraft.  

As we said back then, it's the thin end of a very large wedge.  The thought that students are leaving University now with debts that they will *never* pay off in their working lives seems tragic to me.  

I suspect that's why successive governments have been so keen to get more people to go to university - they're now being run as for-profit concerns.  Feed students, fresh out of school, into the debt machine at one end and they'll be a source of income for the rest of their working lives.

Governments increasingly defer (or gain political cover) from unelected organisations, quangos, and lobbying groups in the so-called third sector (supposedly charities, but many are largely about political campaigning (on non-party issues), even though they often get government funding). 

In each case, the so-called experts are nearly always arguing what is really their self-interest and more money and power for themselves.   

Moreover, the fundamental problems is that ""experts said we must do X"", completely bypasses and neuters the democratic process, and removes democratic accountability for political decisions that should be taken by elected politicians.

I don't want to the government saying ""42 day detention of terrorist suspects is necessary because the police told us"", and shifting the entire grounds of the debate to what is best for the police, and what police officer said what when.  It's not a proper debate if conducted on that basis (argument from authority) - as opposed to what should be done: taking an democratically accountable decision by balancing all competing interests and arguments.

First off, if you want to balance the scales you need to compare the[sources of tax revenue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:UK_taxes.svg) with [where it's being spent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:UKExpenditure.svg). Note these charts cover 2 different periods of time and therefore can only be used as a rough estimate of how things are, but for the sake of this discussion they shall suffice.

First off you can see that the spending on ""Social Protection"" (aka benefits) is larger than the total revenue of income tax. Now assuming that this is just down to differences in the periods these charts measure, do you think these numbers should be so close? The combined taxation of all the working peoples salaries in the country is not enough to cover the wellfare of those who are incapable to work and the unemployed **looking** for work? Don't get me wrong, if people genuinely need wellfare to get by then that's fine by me, but I can't comprehend how these two figures could be so close.

Having spent an extended period of time on wellfare myself I know that it would be unreasonable to cut the benefits available. That said, I think we need to have a serious review of who is claiming benefits and look to put them in to suitable work.

In fact, I dont think there's any area of the budget that we should directly look to cut. Just have initiatives throughout the main areas of spending to try and cut costs.",0,1274271423,null,0,false,0,c0qbd5l,t3_c4umi,t1_c0qbd5l,t3_c4umi,null,1426312595,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,robosatan,null,null,"The philosphy behind this is flawed. Vanguard was without a doubt cutting edge technology when it was put in to commision in '92 and it will no doubt be a reasonable sub when it reaches its age of retirement in 10-20 years, but extending its life span any further is pretty ridiculous.

At the moment it's expect to be decommisioned at 30 years, if they extend it what do we expect to get out of it? Another 20 years would not be unreasonable for the cost of the refit. So what does that mean? It means you could potentially have submarine that's 50 years old going in to a combat situation and in the context of Vanguard, that would be like having Vanguard going in to battle with a WW2 sub (Vanguard launched in 1992 - 50 years = 1942 = WW2).

And we're only delaying the innevitable if we choose to refit a submarine to extend its life. While subs are made to ridiculously tight specifications it's not something you can refit indefinitely. You will have to make the choice, do we make a new type of sub or do we step down as a nuclear power. And while you might consider that a simple choice, I'd argue it is anything but. 

Submarines are just tickets to the ""don't fuck with me"" club. We almost certainly never use them to deploy a nuclear warhead, but the fact we have them is deterrent. We can't go around the world invading every country that could potentially make nukes, especially after the Iraq WMD saga. But you have to appreciate the instability of some of the current nuclear powers. 

Iran is a politically unstable state that is developing weapons in an attempt to balance power with Israel (who has a bunch of nukes from america). North Korea has nukes and Kim Jong Il is not going to live forever, will his successor be given charge of the country without an attempted coup? China and Russia are clawing their way towards and past america economically. Do you think it's completely unlikely that some kind of resource war may occur in the next 20-30 years?

I know this all sounds like paranoid rambling, but the fact of the matter is that subs do not make themselves. It takes years to design, years to fabricate. Labour were already initiating the replacement programme in 2006 and it's not expected to come in to service until some point in 2020, thats 14+ years from the green flag. At the moment that nicely coincides with the probabal [launch date of the last Astute class sub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astute_class_submarine#Submarines_of_the_class). This is an important fact since if you extend the life of Trident what will the specialist shipyard that makes submarines do (Sub's have been made exclusively in barrow for a number of years now)?

Well they'd probably get more interested in Civil Nuclear or something along those lines, probably have to cut some jobs and perhaps shut down areas of the yard only relevant to sub work. It wouldn't be devastating to BAE, but it would smart. Then 10 years after that when the country decides to make some more subs, they go to BAE who gladly take up the contract, but no longer have the workforce that is experienced at making subs. The build is less efficient, the programme is delayed and it costs more money (just like the problems they've faced building Astute with the gap between Astute and Vanguard).

Then there's the fact that a large portion of the money goes in to british businesses. The MoD might write checks for BAE, but the paper trail does not end there. There is very little machining or fabrication done onsite outside the hull and decking. The vast majority of systems are procured from other businesses (both large and small) from across the UK. While I doubt it would cause anybody to go out of business, there's a LOT of money being spent on parts across the country. Money being spent that creates skilled jobs increases the number of trades people/design engineers etc.

All that to save 4 billion of the 40 billion defense budget while the cost of wellfare (190 billion) is higher than the revenue of income tax (150-160 billion)... 

Ok, you probably have the bitter the taste of propaganda in your mouth now. Even so, you have to admit that this programme isn't a bad thing, sure it's a little extravagant considering our current economic circumstances, but wouldn't the budget review be better served reviewing the validity of the wellfare claims of the people who cost more than the combined tax revenue of the entire british people?

Predictably enough it just meant that:

* poorer students were discouraged from going to university because instead of grants they'd be racking up loans,
* the poorer students who *did* go ended up going to shitty ""universities"",
* the better universities just creamed off the best, brightest and wealthiest and ended up admitting even fewer poor kids, and

true,amewnorian,null,null,"&gt; the jacket-wearing Doctor could very easily be a wardrobe miss

I don't think so... The scene where he comes back to talk to Amy (with jacket) must have been filmed around the same time as when he leaves (with jacket).  I find it hard to believe that Matt Smith would do one scene with the jacket off, then put the jacket on to do the next scene, without noticing.  And if they did the ""comes back to talk to Amy"" scene first, THEN realized that he shouldn't have the jacket on so took it off to film the rest, why wouldn't they redo that quick scene?  That set was used quite a bit in the episode, so I doubt they had serious time constraints that would prevent them from re-filming ONE SHORT scene.

Also, what he comes back to tell her, that she needs to remember what he told her when she was seven, doesn't make a whole lot of sense in the context of just that episode; It's probably involved with the season finale, in which case, the jacket theory would make perfect sense.

And one more thing: If I remember correctly, the last thing the camera focused on as the Doctor ran off was the jacket the angels were holding.  Why focus on that, why even have the angels take the jacket in the first place, if not to make the ""HolyShitHesWearingHisJacketAgain"" scene possible?

And one more thing (again): Stephen Moffat seems to like hiding stuff... really, subtle stuff... think of the episodes he's written (with RTD) :

* *The Girl in the Fireplace* - ""If the clock is broken, why is there still ticking?""
* *The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances* - ""If (sorry forget his name) is sitting there, who's using the typewriter?""
* *Silence in the Library/Forest of the dead* - ""So, why do you have two shadows?""

The government wants to encourage you to take moderately risky investments of this type, as such investments help the economy grow, so one method that they use is to charge a lower rate of tax (capital gains) on your earnings from capital gains.

true,MobyDobie,null,null,"Actually it's entirely a Labour binge as far as government spending is considered (yes consumer debt did really take off under Thatcher, but it is entirely different matter and unrelated to the huge national (i.e. government) deficit and national (i.e. government) debt, which these tax rises and cuts are supposed to help with)

National debt was falling under John Major, and actually being paid back.  We had the lowest national debt (as percentage of GDP) in the EU then.

Now we are shooting for one of the highest.

The reason is simple.   Under John Major, government spending was 37% of GDP.  Today it is 53%.

But - it wasn't planned to be anything like 53%.

Gordon Brown, starting in 1999, vastly over-estimated the growth of the economy and likely future tax receipts (you can argue about whether he did this deliberately by fiddling the figures, or had terrible forecasts - the fact the error when on uncorrected for years however suggests the former).

So what happened was that government spending grew at a much faster rate than tax revenues.  Which is why the proportion of GDP spent by the government is so high - and why there is this huge structural deficit.

We are heading off a cliff, and nobody's yet admitted it, not even the new government.  The accummulated government debt from 1999-2010 is about the same as the again as the entire accumulated debit of the previous 200 years, and the anticipated growth in debt, even with austerity measures, between 2010 and 2014, is set to double it again.

This might sound academic, but it's not.  

EITHER: At some point, investors and other countries will stop lending us money because they don't think we'll ever pay it back.   This could happen at any time they lose confidence in our economy.  Then we'll have drastic cuts and tax rates with virtually no notice.

OR: Even if we can keep persuade people to keep lending us more money, at some point the interest payments on our accumulated national debt will be crippling, and mean that we can't afford to spend so much on public services.

I know what you mean about people not applying. There were times I wished I hadn't applied (before the interview) mainly because it's quite a hassle (although I was really lucky with Churchill in that I only had one additional form to fill out, and an interview - no exams or anything). I think the reason is with people like my brother, who had to take the extra exam, go through the additional forms and personal statements, and then just get a rejection without interview (I guess due to the test marks, despite excellent grades otherwise).

To put it bluntly, if you have extra tests then the chances of getting an offer from a state school are minimal. This is because, take the Oxford physics test, for example, they don't publish much of a syllabus, or any past year solutions (I don't think they even used to publish past papers but I think they've changed that now). But at private schools they have much more coaching specifically for these exams, learning matters that aren't on the Alevel syllabus, and sometimes they can even hire past examiners who can obviously help a great deal.

So I think Cambridge approach it a lot better than Oxford do. I think the case with myself and my twin brother demonstrates that perfectly.

""According to the study, animals given nicotine were able to complete tasks more accurately, and ignore distractions more completely, than sober animals given the same tasks. Giving the animals nicotine also stimulated the production of adrenaline, a hormone that sharpens focus. While the effects of the drug were so small as to be useless for healthy people, the researchers believe that the boost in concentration and memory, despite being small, could make a difference in patients whose dementia taxes their concentration and memory—possibly as many as six months more of self-sufficiency.

After everyone told me no and that it was impossible, sky said I could. So I went with their complete package (sky being the only way to get tv here).

The guy didn't show up, I get no mobile signal in the flat so I was a bit miffed. Sky wouldn't give me the guys number and I was told to wait and see. He eventually phoned me himself a couple days later and said Sky had given him the wrong postcode and I should phone them but he'd be round that night. 

I phoned sky and they said that they couldn't update anything till the job was complete. If I wanted to cancel my pending job they could do the rest and update my address. I said that was stupid and they said tough.

Anyway in the meantime the sky guy came and fitted it and said I needed to have a phoneline otherwise sky would give me shit regularly so I phoned sky again and asked about the phone line and they still fed me shit about the pending job even with the job actually being complete.

So I told them to forget it and phoned bt who did everything remotely for twice the cost per month. I spent the next month worrying sky would start charging for the phone line.

The one that sticks in my memory was that when broadband *finally* became available here they brightly announced that I was on a shared phone line, and would have to pay to have another line installed to receive broadband. I'd put the agonisingly slow dial-up connection down to... well, BT being BT ... but no, I was on a split line with a neighbouring property - first we'd heard of it - so we were both on half-speed, and both paying full price! You can imagine how far we got with recompense for that!

Notwithstanding the regular mysterious outages, I've been using BT broadband for years, because once I'd finally *got* it working I didn't dare change *anything* for fear of incurring the usual ""Change - duuurrr"" embuggerence. The router they supplied is still in the box it came in years ago - not touching a damn thing while it works tolerably well, and I'm not in any sort of hurry to install their software and fill my computer with Yahoo cruft.

Would have changed to another ISP years ago but I just can't face the call centre - I don't have time, and if I'm going to be held in the thrall of impotent fury I'd like it to be over a major human rights abuse, not a faceless company milking the remaining energy of their poor alienated staff as if they were dying cattle...

I was moving with two month overlap, so I had a phone put in at the new address, in a different county.  Fine.  Thanks for the £120 charge to connect a severed wire, but don't tell me Ofcom made you do it as that is A Lie.  Never mind.

Move going well, so I cancel the old account, making sure they are cancelling one that matches the address and telephone number of my old account.

A few days later the phone line stops working.  Lots of calls to India and the UK, as you don't get a choice.  Optimistically taking people's names gets you smug operators asking which call centre you called last (they don't tell you that) and then not connecting you.  Can't find a fault with the line.

Skipping through the week of being on hold and being given a runaround, before we establish, surprise surprise, they disconnected the new account, as despite being given STD and address, they did the wrong one.

Hilariously, they then charge me for reconnection, because I don't have one.  It's a deposit I'm told, as I don't have a good credit history.  I can't put in a complaint, because I'm not a customer.  It'll be a new year-long contract, with a termination fee.  The operator magnanimously waives the termination fee that I apparently should have been charged for them disconnecting me by accident.

Amusingly LLU ADSL from Be works fine through this period, on a disconnected phone.  Unfortunately BT give me a new telephone number, and I have to call Be and beg that they update the number but perform no physical work whatsoever.  Be manage this strenous task admirably, and don't even charge.

true,Roxinos,null,null,"&gt;Amy Pond - acts as though the Doctor (and the world) owe her something. 

Eh. I think it's merely a matter of trust.

Rose had no real trust issues with the Doctor. Even early on, it took other people asking her who she was traveling with to realize that she had no clue who the fuck the Doctor was. He just asked her to go with him, and she went.

Amy knows as much about the Doctor now as any Companion, but she doesn't fully trust him. He left her when she was seven and promised to come back in 15 minutes. He didn't come back for 12 years. She went a bit mental with that. Countless hours of therapy. Everyone knew about her obsession with what they thought was just a figment of her imagination. Then he just comes traipsing back into her life as if nothing happened. Regardless of the state of their friendship now, the shit she went through is bound to leave serious scars. And she's bright. She's aware of it.

The Doctor *does* owe Amy something. She doesn't trust him.

From ""Flesh and Stone"":

&gt;Doctor: ""Amy, you need to start trusting me, it's never been more important.""

&gt;Amy: ""But you don't always tell me the truth.""

&gt;Doctor: ""If I always told you the truth I wouldn't need you to trust me.""

None of that was present with Rose. It was just blind trust all the way. When it comes right down to the nitty-gritty and the moment, Amy will trust the Doctor. But in the big picture, she doesn't take anything for granted. That's why she's always simply cutting through the Doctor's bullshit and demanding he ""explain.""

true,SianTam,null,null,"Way back at the beginning of 2000, I had 2 lines in my flat - 1 for phone, one for internet.  On the day I moved out of my flat I contacted them, told them that I was moving, and would like them to move my contract over to my temporary house about 4 miles down the road.  

So they did that, but 3 days later when I went back to the flat to drop something off I'd taken and shouldn't have, the couple there said they'd used the phone just for a quick call to BT to hook themselves up.

I was puzzled, because, as I told them, there wasn't supposed to be a phone, it having moved with me down the road.  Turns out BT had moved my PHONE line, but failed to move the line I used for internets.  WTF?  Yes, I'm moving, but no, you can leave that line there for the new people to use, and I'll happily pay for it!

THEN, 2 months later we moved into our proper house (about 50 yards down the road from the original flat, as it happens), and on the day we moved in, the lady moving out told us she'd told BT to cancel, so I'd need to set up the phone.  However, she'd used it that very morning to tell BT, so it should simply be a case of connecting it.

You'd think, wouldn't you?  I called on my mobile, they said sure, but nothing worked.  I kept calling, and eventually they said they'd need to get an engineer out, because there was a fault at the house.  I suggested that it was way more likely to be at their end because it'd been working that morning, and all that had happened was that the previous owner had asked for it to be disconnected.  

Unfortunately BT aren't quite so useful, so I had to wait 3 weeks for an engineer appointment, who said, about 2 minutes after he arrived, ""Nothing wrong here, it's probably at the exchange.""  When I complained to BT about this, they just said it'd taken that long to get an engineer out because we'd not been available for one of the weeks.

So I told them I wasn't going to have a bloody BT phone in my house, called NTL, who installed within 24 hours, 2 lines, and I've now got 20Mb broadband with them.  And I know there's loads of people who have horror stories about NTL (Virgin), but they've been blinding - no complaints here.

""on the grounds of national security."" got to do with whatever happened in a police prison cell? ... How the hell has that got anything to do with national security?!?

&gt;So what this case is showing us is that Human Rights don't protect us from national security spying in any way. That's a wonderful way to totally throw out Human Rights and all liberty by using that blanket joker card, ""its for national security"".

&gt;Great so now our ever growing Police State can spy for any reason and simply claim its for national security? ... that's like the way RIPA was used to spy on rubbish dumpers and the way RIPA was used to spy on school catchment area allocation.

&gt;WTF is happening to our country. The UK once upon a time not only had a spine but was also proud to have a spine, yet now fear of Terrorists (tm) and the perpetual war against Terrorism is used like a blank cheque way to totally erode all civil liberties, in the name of safety from fear. Its the perfect cover story within which to continually creep in ever more outright totalitarian attitudes.

&gt;@""The Government explained that is has a policy of ""neither confirm nor deny"" which it said was important to ensure the overall effectiveness of surveillance operations.""

&gt;Wonderful so now we can't be allowed to know if they are spying on us. So yes I remember that kind of thinking from the 1984 book as well. People didn't know when Big Brother was watching them, (it was never confirmed or denied when Big Brother was watching) but it didn't need to, it was simply the fear of Big Brother *maybe* watching that kept everyone in line. Fear was the tool to keep people in line. That's a common theme of totalitarian attitudes.

&gt;Example RIPA powers:

&gt;Interception of a communication, i.e. Wire taps and reading post.

&gt;Directed surveillance, i.e. Following people.

&gt;Covert human intelligence sources, i.e. Informers.

&gt;Intrusive surveillance i.e. Bugging houses/vehicles.

&gt;Yes sadly that sounds exactly like the powers of a totalitarian state. I have no problem at all with law enforcement, but when that enforcement can be twisted, subverted and abused into a way of spying on anyone at will, then its an utter abuse of power, yet that is exactly what we are increasingly getting. So on the one hand the politicians tell us its all going to be fixed, yet on the other hand we have news example after news example of how its not fixed, its actually getting ever worse and its getting worse because dozens of groups are each making their own power grabs to remorselessly exploit and abuse technology.

&gt;There has always been very good reasons why throughout history, people all around the world have tried very hard to protect their privacy, liberty and freedom from state interference. Fail to learn from history and we walk right back into the same problems again, only this time, with the power of ever better (yet ever more abused) technology, the state is becoming more powerful than at any time in history and yet the people in power have shown countless times how their kind cannot just be trusted with ever increasing power. Their actions have to be policed or they become part of the problem. Yet just about every day we have example after example news showing how its slowly getting ever worse.

Trying to be everything to everybody makes for something that nobody likes, so I'm glad they didn't try. Personally, Smith's Doctor appeals to me in a compelling way that RTD's Doctors never quite did.

Let me put it this way: I was already a Whovian back when Tom Baker's eps started getting distributed on PBS stations here in the States, also enjoyed the Pertwee eps that eventually showed up, as well as Davison's, and from there I lost track (either no local broadcasts or no TV to watch them on).

Since the series ""regenerated"", I've seen a couple-few eps each of Eccleston and Tennant, which were plenty enjoyable to watch, but I found the writing, direction and performances to be a bit frothy, mostly just ""light entertainment"", so they didn't really compel me to ""collect the whole set"", just more of a ""maybe I'll get around to catching up someday"" feeling.

After watching Smith's proper debut in ""The Eleventh Hour"", I was immediately compelled by everything about it, not least Smith's and Gillan's performances, to start keeping up with the latest eps, and most of my geeky friends that I've introduced to the Eleventh Doctor were impressed and surprised at how much better the new season is than they would have expected from previous seasons' eps they'd seen.

Some point 12yrs previous when the engineer had gone out to fit the line something had fucked up and he had 2 numbers noted against his account. 1 number was his home phone, the other a ghost that he never knew existed. 

I checked as far back as the records I had access to would let me. Not a single call ever. Line showed as active, but had never, not once, been used. Guy had still been charged for it of course. £12 a month for 12 years.

I could only see back as far as a couple of those years so I couldn't refund him the full amount, only a few hundred. I had to refer him to a different team to get the other grand and a half refund.

Anonymity until conviction is obvious:

Although many people are too ignorant, thoughtless or emotional to be held to this standard, the legal principle is very clear: *presumed innocent until proven guilty*.

Publicising the names of alleged lawbreakers just allows such people (self-servingly egged on by the media) to jump to conclusions, and you risk ""trial by media"", where even if someone's acquitted, they're still ruined for life.

Once someone has been convicted, however, *society has decided they're guilty* - there's no worry about trial by media, because they've had *trial by trial*, and the result is that they *are* considered guilty by society.

Now, once someone's served their debt to society you can argue that they may still be discriminated against by individuals, but the alternative is basically the abolition of criminal records and CRB checks, and that argument completely ignores things like the statistical likelihood of recidivism.

TL;DR: People shouldn't be considered guilty *until they're found guilty*, so if the media and population insist on jumping to conclusions then there's a case for anonymity until convicted.  Once they're found guilty, however, the conclusions can't be jumped-to *because it's already been reached by rational means*, and there are good, solid reasons why anonymity should no longer be preserved.

This is true, but there are two separate issues at work here:

Vigilantism is wrong - no argument there - but it's also relatively rare, even given our temporary ""trendy"" bullshit paedophilia hysteria.

However, the stigma of being a criminal (even once the debt is paid) *does* sometimes serve to discourage criminal behaviour in others, so although we both agree things like the Sex Offenders' Register are over the top, I think there's at least a case to be made for denying anonymity to convicted criminals.

Importantly, I'm not advocating *publicly shaming* criminals (like making sex offenders go door-to-door outing themselves when they move into a new neighbourhood), but I think (sex-offender-inspired hysteria aside) we have a comparatively reasonable compromise now - convicted criminals are not granted anonymity, but you can leave prison, get a job, keep your head down and - as long as you don't want to work in sensitive jobs - largely leave your past behind you.

In granting even convicted criminals guaranteed anonymity you remove the (slim) possibility of vigilantism, but you also remove much of the deterrent effect of being convicted of a crime.

As you're the one advocating change, I guess the onus is on you justify why.  As such, what *specifically* do you think is wrong enough with the current system that granting convicted criminals anonymity (and thereby reducing the deterrent effect of conviction) is a good solution? :-)",0,1274441226,null,0,false,0,c0qgjim,t3_c6d0j,t1_c0qgjim,t1_c0qgiad,null,1426315029,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Did you hear this claim somewhere specific or is it an assumption you've made?

&gt; They've actually measured significant reductions in heart failure rates (~15%) among non-smokers following smoking bans.

Wow, really? We're citing that as proof now? Despite the dozens of campaigns to improve peoples health through diet and exercise?

From yet another study yielding identical results:
http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/326/7398/1057

&gt;&gt;Objective: To measure the relation between environmental tobacco  smoke, as estimated by smoking in spouses, and long term mortality from tobacco related disease.

&gt; &gt; For participants followed from 1960 until 1998 the age  adjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval) for never smokers married to ever smokers compared with never smokers married to never smokers was 0.94 (0.85 to 1.05) for coronary heart disease, 0.75 (0.42 to 1.35) for lung cancer, and 1.27 (0.78 to 2.08) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among 9619 men, and 1.01 (0.94 to 1.08), 0.99 (0.72 to 1.37), and 1.13 (0.80 to 1.58), respectively, among 25 942 women. No significant associations were found for current or former exposure to environmental tobacco smoke before or after adjusting for seven confounders and before or after excluding participants with pre-existing disease. No significant associations were found during the shorter follow up periods of 1960-5, 1966-72, 1973-85, and  1973-98.

&gt; &gt; Conclusions The results do not support a causal relation between  environmental tobacco smoke and tobacco related mortality, although they do not rule out a small effect. The association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and coronary heart disease and lung cancer may be considerably weaker than generally believed.

Please look up [relative risk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk) before we continue this discussion. A measurable increase is not a significant one that means anything. If you are going to link to studies it is essential that you understand the language. Take a look at the quoted bit above; to the layman it does suggest an increased risk when it absolutely does not. 

From your linked article: ""the magnitude of the increased risk remains debated"". The magnitude is key. Otherwise you get [this crap](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTu7GLfrmUI). Soup causes cancer, OMG!


&gt; Also the studies in question compared their results to areas that did not ban smoking and used it as a baseline for comparison.

I'm gonna call for a citation there so I can show you their bad science. What controls did they use? ""Other areas"" is worthless nonsense because there were more important factors. For example, the volume off traffic passing by is far more important because the smoke from there is infinitely worse for you. 

To summarize, the large medial associations do not want to encourage discussion of this because it may lead some first-hand smokers to think that their risks are also low. It also would create doubt the competency of the medical community after so many of them have used this as a guilt trip.

Are you going to address the fact that you've made numerous assumptions about any studies you don't like being ""industry funded""? Or are we just gonna keep shifting the goalposts?

River is romantically linked to the doctor, not familial linked.

The watch is interesting, but so subtle, so it might just be a wardrobe thing. 

The two bow ties - it is just like the 10th doctor's suits.  Two colors has been a constant for some time now.  One color (red tie) denotes future/present.  One color (blue tie) denotes traveling in the past.  Venice and WWII were linear to the current story, not another Doctor, etc. and since they took place in the past, blue tie.

There is another Doctor - the one who visits Amy in the forest, but that is to-date the only instance we have seen of him (except maybe at the end of 11th hour - the Amy dream thing). 

River's Diary and John Smith's diary are vastly different.  Not the same books at all. 

The angle of the moon and Big Ben - I think these are nothing.   The FX team was just making it look cool and probably didn't have any more direction than ""make the TARDIS fly by Big Ben at night.  We need it in 6 weeks and your budget is this..""

There is the official Synopsis on the last two episodes, which gives some info about the Pandorica here:

Basically, it's fun to speculate and try to figure it out, but don't over-think it and spend massive brain power on it.  I can almost guarantee that no matter what they come up with, we will not guess it.

Time and all possibilities of time are in the Doctor's mind. Does your computer synchronize to an online server to get it's time correctly? I suspect that's the way the Doctor sees time: non-linear but synched to the source.

Furthermore, time itself has fixed points (see http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Laws_of_Time

What about testing for the use of date rape drugs? Surely that would corroborate any accusation of rape. There is the problem of alcohol though, because it's legal and not exactly out of place. But if it could be demonstrated that one person is significantly less capable than the other of consent (by morning after blood tests), that would be helpful.

Of course, there is a cultural problem. In that heavy intoxication limits or eliminates the capacity to consent, but is both widespread and commonly precedes (relatively anonymous) sex. That isn't to say that people who, for example, drink heavily deserve to be raped, just that there is significant overlap between consensual and non-consensual sex scenarios.

Also, if there isn't enough evidence to prosecute with just one victim, there is nothing to stop the police from waiting for another victim to come forward unprompted. I know that I am over-simplifying the situation, I'm not taking into account anything like the social stigma etc. faced by rape victims.

I really do feel that prevention is by far the best option when it comes to this. Well, that's obvious, it would be best if no one was raped. But what I mean is, on the legal side we should focus on minimizing damage to the innocent rather than prosecution of the guilty (there is no use creating more victims). On the cultural, education side, we should focus on techniques to prevent it in the first place -- public information campaigns (don't accept drinks from anyone but the bar man etc.), discouraging risky behaviour, promotion of equality, education about the law and so on.

I think another thing worth mentioning is that when it comes to date rape, it's not necessarily seen as rape by both parties (even when both parties are reasonable, otherwise law-abiding people). Consider the example two people who are drunk to varying degrees. The sex that happens and the lead up to it follows a consensual (although perhaps less lucid) pattern, there is no physical or verbal resistance. It is only afterwards that one of the parties decides that it was not consensual. Surely intent must form part of the crime in this scenario. The intention is one of the few distinguishing factors between a drunken mistake and rape. Where there is no violence and no deliberate coercion is involved, the crime is all in the perception. This is how it seems to me anyway.

Again, I don't mean to suggest that anyone deserves what they get, just everyone has a role to play in reducing the incidence of rape and that part this involves a cultural change.",0,1274490863,null,0,false,0,c0qibf5,t3_c6nfr,t1_c0qibf5,t1_c0qi5lj,null,1426315876,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"Here are my suggestions:

* First Doctor - **Keys of Marinus** or **The Time Meddler**. Keys is the better option for a real feel of Hartnell's era, but it's like 7 or 8 parts, so I suggest the Time Meddler (bonus: first appearance of another Time Lord. This still being long before the mention of Time Lords) if you don't want to spend almost 4 hours watching 1964 production values and pacing

* Second Doctor - **Tomb of the Cybermen** Paced much more like the 70's and 80's stories but gives a real feel for Troughton's Doctor, plus great incidental music.

* Third Doctor - **Death to the Daleks** (personally consider Pertwee's Dalek stories to be the most epic. Death is both epic and clocks in at only 4 parts.) Also, weird glowy aliens and a strange  chant that gets stuck in your head.

* Fourth Doctor - (lots to choose from, not trying to overload, but) **Pyramids of Mars**, **Underworld** or **State of Decay** or all 3 for solid examples of early, middle and late Fourth.

* Fifth Doctor - **Kinda** (trippy, mystical and interesting story, crappy ""special effect"" [terrible paper mache prop](/spoiler) at the end.) or **Earthshock** Everyone else will tell you **Caves of Androzani**, but Caves isn't representative of most of Five's era.

* Sixth Doctor - Everyone hates Six (I loved his Doctor, but he got some bad writing and some bad production crews), but **Attack of the Cybermen** is an excellent example of when they mostly got what they were going for with his Doctor. Bonus points, the chameleon circuit in the TARDIS works briefly and hilariously. Also contains the line: ""Unstable? Unstable?! UNSTABLE?!?! This, Peri, is as stable as you will ever see me"", the very thing you asked for in your post.

* Seventh Doctor - **Greatest Show in the Galaxy** There are others I could recommend (everybody hates in Seven too but he had some decent stuff), but Greatest Show contains all the elements of what Seven is all about without having to have seen his and Ace's dynamic before. Plus, Nord, Vandal of the Roads! And Robot Clowns! And  a werewolf! and [The gods of Ragnarok!](/spoiler)
 
* Eighth Doctor - Only one choice. Don't much care for it myself, but Mcgann did his best in a strange mixture of a British sci/fi icon with a 90's Fox Made for TV Movie. His really good stuff as Eight is in the Big Finish audio stories, but they may not be your thing.

* Ninth Doctor - Gotta go with a two-parter, **The Empty Child** --&gt; **The Doctor Dances** Just great stuff with Eccleston showing off his full range.

* Tenth Doctor - **The Idiot's Lantern** because it's a really good self-contained story that doesn't really depend on the overall story arc or **The Girl in the Fireplace** for the same reason. 

* 11th Doctor - (so far) **The 11th Hour** (hell, just watch it and catch up with the current season because at this point you either like Doctor Who or you don't) or **Amy's Choice**

Kind of true, but much like asbestos, just because no one thought it was a problem doesn't mean it wasn't one.
&gt;This level of widespread stress didn't exist as a medical condition before the Sixties. 

Up until the early 90s marital rape didn't exist as a legal problem. Must be a fashion thing as well.

&gt;Nowadays, women who've never been in a war zone or experienced an act of terrorism are claiming they are suffering from stress, when all they do is run a home and get the bus to work.

Really, those uppity ladies…

However, a ""chav"", especially as a TV character (i.e. even more stereotyped), is definitely going to be a bit annoying to put up with.

I really like Catherine Tate as a -new series- companion (Donna Noble), because she is the most experienced actress of the -new series- companions, she's a renowned comedian and it's very apparent in her timing: particularly the scene between her and Meta-Crisis tenth doctor after the hand regenerates ""Oi"" ""Oi"" ""No!"". I think the writers made her like one of Tate's own creations from her shows and they often reference Tate's show in witty ways. (With the Sontarans, when donna hits one with a hammer and goes ""Back of the neck!"" being a reference to her own show where she has a character who's catchphrase is ""Back of the net!"". Brilliant.)

I do find that both of those characters are a bit influenced by their real-life established celebrity, which is why I really like Martha Jones and Amy Pond in one way, because I'm not comparing them to anything else they've done and I feel the characters are REALLY dictated by the writers.

Everyone else seems to have the Best Episodes covered, but I'll give what I think are the best single scenes/moments that typify that version of the Doctor.
9th - ""Dalek"" when he's in the room alone with the Dalek for the first time.  Second choice would be the end of ""The Doctor Dances"" when he [not only figures out what's going on with the Empty Child and how to fix it, but he doesn't solve the problem himself.  Instead, he gives Nancy the knowledge and the inspiration to resolve it.](/spoiler)
10th - ""The Christmas Invasion"", right off the bat with his first real scene.  He walks in, completely ignores the Big Bad, and spends his time chatting with everyone.  Shortly after, [he ruins Harriot Jones's career](/spoiler) in exactly the way he said he would.
11th - ""Flesh and Stone"", the speech right before the cliffhanger ending.  Second, the end of ""The 11th Hour""...""Basically...run.""  Those speeches are what I like best about this Doctor...completely confident.  This, of course, may change later.",0,1274554557,null,0,false,0,c0qjn5m,t3_c6ukd,t1_c0qjn5m,t3_c6ukd,null,1426316496,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

However, as she explored the universe with the Doctor, she learned just how insignificant she was (if you will), and she really grew from that. She gained respect for things as the series progressed. The saddest thing I thought was that she lost all of that and was turned back into the selfish person she had been. The Doctor thought he was doing her a favor by letting her live, but I think she would have much preferred dying as a better person than living as a selfish one.

I was actually really disappointed with how she was handled in ""The End of Time"". I was really hoping she would regain her memories and do something amazing to help the Doctor out, and then die - a sacrifice, but dying with the full knowledge of the person who she became.

The arrogance/not caring about consequences/bitchy behavior seem very characteristic of 19 year olds - finally feeling like an adult and feeling like you can do anything and it won't matter. The insensitiveness/whinyness I think reflects on her upbringing...Jackie also had those characteristics, so it makes sense to me that Rose would too. I think that unfortunately the coolness of Rose turned into a bit of Mary-Sueness, but I really have no trouble believing Rose would have gone to the ends of the Earth to get back to the Doctor.

Interestingly, the arguments you make for disliking Rose I think apply just as much to Amy Pond. 

* Amy is arrogant - she consistently makes comments that allude to her believing she knows the Doctor intimately *and* that she's the most important person in the universe to him. (When as far as we know, all Amy really knows is what she's imagined about him during those 12 years.)

* Amy is insensitive. She treats Rory just as bad as Rose treated Mickey, I think. 

* Amy doesn't seem to care about consequences either - she did run off with a man on the night before her wedding.

* Amy could be considered whiny - ""Why did *you* say five minutes??""

* I could definitely call Amy's treatment of the Doctor after those 12 years in ""The Eleventh Hour"" bitchy.

A little story: When I first moved to London years ago I lived in Romford Essex and slept on the couch of one of the local boys who knew everyone ( we ran a recording studio together in London Bridge) anyway,  there's this pub ( FTR called The Bridge House ) where a few of the reporters from the Sun, News of the World etc. used to spend afternoons sniffing cocaine, drinking beer and talking about who they were going to bring down next, at first I though it was all a laugh, but then you realise they weren't kidding when you saw the ( discussed ) person on the papers front page. These so called reporters set out to ruin lives, and they do exactly that. 

So... next time you see Kate Moss or some other personality caught sniffing coke, or some footballer caught cheating with a prostitute or some businessman caught taking bribes etc. on the front page of one of these shitty little dirt rags, chances are it's all been planned, set up and acted out by their reporters.

&gt;Queen Elizabeth is the nominal head of the church as well as of the state (and the armed forces). On her expiration date, her eldest son — a sad and foolish man with a half-baked interest in Islam — will become the head of the Church of England. The family values of Henry VIII have left the British with an absurdity at the very apex of their system. The belief in monarchy is deeply related to the supernatural and the irrational and was founded on the wicked idea of “the divine right of kings.” All supposed glamour to one side, the institution still bears the ineffaceable and lowly stamp of this origin, for which the words “fairy tale” might have been designed. In a short time, after a long reign, this will become uncomfortably and indeed unpleasantly clear. The mad principle of heredity will give us, not just a charmless and chinless dauphin, but a brooding, resentful, religious creep.

The arguament isn't about design, but about influence. It was Charles' influence that contributed to the slashing of funding for Prof. Edzard Ernst and the Department of Complementary Medicine at Exeter Uni. The only institution of it's kind in the UK that exists to subject complementary medicine to proper scientific scrutiny. He has compiled a list of what works, what doesn't, and how it compares to real medicine. 

Long story short, Prof Ernst exposed a Duchy Originals Detox Tincture for what it was, an expensive bottle of snake oil. Prince Charles had his aide (who also works for his charity that exists to sell 'Alternative Medicine' to gullable fools) write a letter to the Vice Chancellor of Exeter Uni, on the Prince's official regal letterhead, basically telling him to sack Ernst. The result of this is that the Department of Complementary Medicine now has to find a new source of funding or close it's doors. 

So we have a bloke with no special training using his position as the Queens son to not only sell a load of wank to guillable people, but also using this influence to have anyone who disagrees with him and his prejudices fired. Surely you can't agree with that? 

You have to ask the questions, if Charles was an ordinary bloke, would he:

a. be able to make a successful business out of selling overpriced sausages and homeopathic sugar pills?

The truth is that we are no worse that the rest of Europe.

The truth is that public spending has not caused our problems (try massive bank bailouts and falling tax revenues).

The truth is that spending cuts wont help at this point.  (6 billion is a radical cut but its only 2.5% of our deficit so it wont even cover the interest).

The deficit is shitty but Brown did not cause it and spending cuts wont save us.

&gt; The pain is down to debt which is down to our banking sector raping us. Not Gordon Browns Chancellorship or the recession.

Yes, the sprawling banking sector and the UK's heavy reliance on financial services in London and the South East had nothing to do with Gordon Brown's tenure as Chancellor.  How could we be so stupid.

The tripartite nature of financial regulation in the city, which Brown instigated, led to very little financial oversight by regulators.  This is precisely what Brown wanted:

&gt;I want us to build on our advantages - your talent for innovation, the critical mass of skills now in London, our openness to the world including our deepening links with China and India, a unique combination of language, time zone and a legal system that makes English law the law of choice for international contracts. And now the determination of the financial services authority to extend their risk-based approach of financial regulation that is both a light touch and a limited touch. 

From 2005.  Sounds like a recipe for success!  [Cite](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/1847.htm).

The fact is, you're heralding a guy who can't understand ""sell when the market's high"" as an economic genius.

&gt; You don’t have to like brown but he fixed the lefts reputation for economic incompetence and he kept us on an even keel for 13 years.

Seriously?  Restored the left's economic reputation?  He honestly didn't have to do much to be better than his forebears.  There's a reason the left had such an appalling reputation for economic mismanagement.

It's amazing that all the problems in the UK's economy are down to global causes, completely out of Brown's control, yet the economic success of the 1990s is attributed to Brown.

Give it a rest, it's tired, and the rest of the country is sick of it.  Brown had 13 years to redress the balance.  He didn't.  He accelerated it far beyond 1980s levels because Labour loved the tax income that the city provided. 

&gt; The truth is, no one saw the crash coming (except maybe vince cable and we laughed him out of the room). Brown could have forced us to diversify but that would have been costly and painful and labour would have failed to get re-elected. All the way to the crash people were asking for less regulation, more free market. Brown did nothing to stop it but if he had we would have thought he was mad and promptly sacked him.

Pure and utter drivel.

&gt; Also, you really need to look at the causes to ""Brown Bottom"". It goes just slightly deeper than no one knowing to sell high.

Yes, I know all about Brown wanting to shore up the fledgling Euro by buying Euros with British money.  What does that matter?  He picked the bottom of the market to do it, and this ignores the pretty damned interesting question of why British money was being spent trying to shore up the Euro in the first place.

By comparison, Labour lovies have spent the last 15 years pointing and laughing at the incompetence Major and LaMonte displayed with the Black Wednesday debacle.

Whether you like it or not Thatcher started the wheels rolling.  So she is **in part** responsible.  **So are Blair and Brown** who continued what she did.  So are the banking bosses who took the risks.  So are the other 60million people in the UK who voted them into power again and again on the promise of cheap mortgages for all and bankers making us all rich for no work.

So my point (again since you didn't answer any of them):

Its not public spending that was the problem (remember when you said it was 4 comments up the tree?  Thats what I am calling you on)

EVERYONE was to blame for the financial crash 2 years ago.  You were, I was, brown was, thatcher was.  We all asked for it.  We all voted for it.  We all would have dragged to the asylum anyone who said ""maybe its not a good idea to leant people money they will never be able to repay""

""Brown Bottom"", the gold price went up when the US and EU saw it fall as Brown sold his, paniced and limited their own sales of gold.  So it was (and is) an inflated price.  If they had done the opposite and sold it crashing the price would you be here touting him as a genius for selling just before it crashed?  No.  You abandoned logic long ago for ideology and hate.

On the one hand, it's great that we seem to be moving away from the all and powerful Doctor that Davies seemed to love writing about (although, admittedly it's fun occasionally when they bring him out). 

On the other hand, I would just like it a bit of the Doctor wasn't such a schmuck....or rather treated like such a schmuck all the time. They're in a village covered by a big red electro-dome thing, the ground is collapsing under their feet and a rather large group of lizard people on on their way; one of which happens to be in their church basement and the the Doctor is the only fellow who seems to know what the hell is going on. For his trouble's he's been berated, dismissed, yelled at, blamed and held with general disdain. 

Doctor: Stay together. I'll see this through. Haven't I proven myself a fairly smart guy so far. We've managed to catch one of those lizard people and everything. If you need credentials ask that guy there, he was with me when I saved him and his girlfriend from freaky dream world death, deadly fish-vampires in renaissance Italy and captured the elusive Prisoner Zero for the Atraxi by writing a computer virus on a borrowed phone, spread via laptop and a guy named...Jeff? saving the whole world from being sterilized with fire. Surely they can vouch for me.

Crazy mother: Listen. we've got no reason to really dislike you, but we're going to treat you shoddily anyway. I've got some cricket bats to get and a tazer to secret away, which I will probably use in some capacity to initiate war with the lizard people. Meanwhile, I'm going to leave you in the care of some strange man who I don't seem to like even though I only met him 20 minutes ago. Please feel free to run off by yourself, in the dark to retrieve some flash headphones. Everyone else should keep yelling at the only guy here who might be able to save us. We should really tear into him about losing those people (because it's totally his fault), not tell him about that freaky green vein stuff going on with the old man and totally deride him for suggesting that we should actually speak to the threatening lizard people who, apparently, are only threatening because we've totally loosed a big ass drill down on top of their lizard civilization. So even though it's just a big misunderstanding, my take is we should dissect the lizard girl or, at the very least, beat her up a bit because the only way to show those damn lizard people we want our people back unharmed is to totally harm the lizard girl prisoner. That'll show them whose boss. They won't dare attack the half dozen of us even though they've got us effectively trapped and even though they have thousands of warrior-caste lizard folk down there and, clearly, superior technology.

I don't need to know every second of every episode that Amy wonders constantly about their boring future life or if she really chooses Rory or if Rory thinks she might be a bit mad, love her desperately, is a good catch or what-not. 

Maybe ""unimpressed"" is bad choice of words...

I mean to say she has all of time and all of space to play with and she chooses **Rio**? I assume it's Earth's Rio lest they would of said something along the lines of ""not the city Barcelona, the planet Barcelona"" and then mention something about dogs with no noses, right? I also assume she's the one who picked because she's the one who seemed the most upset and 'Amy's boys' are hardly going to dictate much of anything to Amy as she seems to be the Alpha male in this triad, at least, most of the time.

Any assessment is bound to be facile, though, because as with any relationship, both members are going to take multiple roles depending on the situation. So The Doctor and Amy can be many things to each other. I like the sibling angle, though. It hasn't really been tried before on the show, and that's saying something. The Doctor has been Grandfather(Susan), Uncle(Zoe?), Teacher(Leela), Friend(Donna), Lover(Rose), Father(Adric), Husband(Romana II, at least in subtext), Unwilling Partner(Romana I), Admirer(Jo), Subject of Admiration(Martha), and Kidnapper(Tegan) to his companions.

true,real_moxie,null,null,"Amy irks me. Here are the reasons why:

* She's very arrogant. She seems to be under the impression that she knows the Doctor intimately, if only because he is *her* raggedy Doctor. And even when she learns something about him (such as the importance of River, or that she doesn't know his name), she brushes it off, like it doesn't even matter. Her arrogance that she unquestionably believes she's the most important person in the Doctor's world, despite knowing she knows, in reality, very little about him really bothers me. She doesn't even bother trying to get to know him, or figure him out - she just seems to assume she already does, even when it should be very clear to her that she doesn't.

* She apparently has a trust issue with the Doctor, yet still travels with him. If she didn't trust the Doctor to some extent, she wouldn't be traveling with him. I actually believe she trusts the Doctor way more than she is willing to admit (but then again, I'm not sure if it's actually the Doctor himself, or the Doctor she thinks he is in her mind). The issue so much doesn't seem to be trusting the Doctor, but trusting in general. If that isn't really touched upon, and it's left solely as trusting the Doctor, I think she's lost an excellent opportunity for characterization that I'd probably really like.

* Amy is compared as 'better' than Rose or Martha because she doesn't romantically love the Doctor (though she does apparently lust after him.) I'm not sure why the lusting is less annoying than the loving. I also think the lusting came out of nowhere... Anyway, whether or not she loves the Doctor, I think Amy is very much obsessed with the Doctor, which I don't see as too much different than Rose or Martha either. Sure, she's not making lovey faces at him, but she's also not letting him get away - she's staying with him and that's that. Her obsession lets her gloss over the fact that the Doctor believes River is his wife - her obsession lets her believe she is the only one who is 'right' for the Doctor, the only one who the Doctor trusts and should be with. Her obsession with the Doctor she thinks she knows is actually a little creepy.

* Amy is compared to Donna for loving the adventure like Donna did. Adventure with the Doctor! I think Amy could care less about the adventure, she's much more focused on the Doctor and keeping him close to her. She doesn't care about figuring out the weird stuff, like Donna, Rose, and even Martha did - she apparently wants to relax on the beach with her boys. That's not loving adventure to me. 

* Amy seems to be there to do nothing during a lot of the episode, but then suddenly swoops in and saves the day at the last minute. Or else she's the one being captured/put in the situation of needing rescuing. Yay. (This ties in with the irk that she was a pro companion right off the bat - didn't take the time to settle in and be in awe of the universe, just stepped in and started solving the problems the Doctor couldn't.)

* Amy is repeatedly shown to be level-headed and good at quickly problem solving in tight moments, but then suddenly falls apart and can't find a noisy communicator a foot in front of her. 

* Amy treats Rory as the man who supports her obsession with the Doctor, not as the man she loves. (Thought I read that he grew up with her, played games with her that centered on him playing as the Doctor.) I don't believe that she loves him, just that she loves what he does for her. And even though she chose, in an extremely emotional moment, to not live without him (his support of her), the next episode later she seems shocked and a little perturbed by the fact that she's apparently still with him 10 years later. Her treatment of him is no better than Rose's treatment of Mickey - both are sort of like keeping the backup guy around in case the Doctor thing gets a bit messy. 

* There are apparently some complaints that Rose and Donna were too important - the season revolved around them! - and yet we've gotten indication that maybe Amy is going to be just as integral to the season as both Rose and Donna...and no one seems to be bothered by that.

So yeah. Amy irks me.

Where are you referring to with this? ""The End of Time""? Or somewhere in Classic Who? I'm not sure I remember seeing him humbled, but I also haven't seen Classic Who.

I do think I view the new seasons as one continuous story.

* Part one: 9 is left reeling with the understanding that he is the only Time Lord left. He has to cope with the knowledge that he killed his own race. Full of pain and rage, he goes back to a place that's got good memories for him, and begins to recover. Just the mention of being a Time Lord still brings respect, and some fear, from others.

* Part two: 10, more giddy with discovering parts of universe than anything else, continues to hold onto the ideals of his race, believing that it's the best way he can remember them. After a lot of heartache, and losing people special to him, he realizes that he really *is* the only one left, and he can do whatever he wants. He's alone and full of power. He could be respected out of fear, rather than being kind! Humanity shows him that for all his 'God-like' powers, he can't always take away the choice. It's a tough lesson to take and leaves him even more alone.

* Part three: 11 is trying to be careful, doesn't want to make the same power-hungry mistakes he's made before. He's a little unsure of himself, and the fact that he's losing the awe humans have always had with him, and even other alien races view him as more of an artifact rather than important are making it harder for him to believe in himself. He *thinks* he's doing right, but he's not quite sure what's right anymore, since he doesn't quite trust himself. He's even more lonely, and more afraid of 'God-like'-ness, but confused since he's also not viewed that way anymore.",0,1274728617,null,0,true,0,c0qo42w,t3_c7jwc,t1_c0qo42w,t1_c0qo004,null,1426318595,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

Rape shield laws [didn't come about until the 70s in the U.S.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_shield_law#In_the_United_States_of_America).  Hardly Victorian-era.  We're not talking about Saudi Arabia, we're talking Western developed countries with secular laws.

&gt;Now I imagine the anonymity is upheld because it is so hard for most rape victims to go through a court case, where scores of strangers see and hear them facing questions on such a painful and emotive issue, while the defence tries to trash them in every way (this still goes on, even though the victim's sexual history should be irrelevant) - for their name and photo to also be broadcast on television and in newspapers, let's face it, who would ever come forward?

Interestingly, in UK law, the ""imputation of unchastity"" was itself considered defamatory early last century, as can be seen by the successful verdict against MGM in the [Prince Yusopov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Yusupov#Exile) case.

Either a sound artifact or a bird summoned by Walt (who has been known to summon birds before) in order to warn people of the trap they were walking right into.

&gt;Sayid's resurrection

Dunked in runoff from the life-based energy.

&gt;Why the supply drops continued long after the purge or who is making them.

Possibly due to a miscommunication with the mainland or time travel weirdness where the drops recur infinitely.

&gt;Where the glass eye came from, what it was.

Belonged to Mikhail Bakunin, of the Flame station.

&gt;What was up with Walts psychic powers?

Based on what we've seen of the Island and the people who are born on it, it was likely seepage of the energy to the rest of the world.

&gt;How did the Others know Walt was on the raft and not on the beach?

They are known to be sneaky and have been known to visit the beach camp unnoticed. This is like asking how spies know where their targets are.

&gt;Who ransacked the beach camp?

Time. Boars and weather.

&gt;Who were the pursuers in the outrigger?

Considering the trade of outriggers over time, likely Widmore's people trying to kill Locke.

&gt;Who committed the Ajira massacre?

The man in black. This was fairly obvious.

&gt;How does the Island move?

Travel through Time And Relative Dimensions in Space.

&gt;How is the Island hidden from the rest of the world?

The weird time distortion. As soon as you notice it, you haven't noticed it yet.

&gt;What is the cause and nature of the time dilation effects around the Island?

Ripples from the energy underneath.

&gt;Why is it necessary to travel through certain bearings to get to and from the Island?

Why is it necessary to travel at certain angles to best move through repulsing currents?

&gt;What is the source of the Island's healing properties?

Energy underneath.

&gt;Why are there problems with pregnancies on the Island after 1977?

Not sure, but I think Jacob wanted to keep a running tally of humans.

&gt;Does the Island manipulate/exert control over events in the outside world?

I don't think so; I think the people who become obsessed with it do all the manipulation they need.

&gt;Who were the original inhabitants of the Island?

Either people who were on the Island when it formed, or people who got lost and somehow managed to end up there. Just people.

&gt;Why did the Island heal Locke's legs and Rose's cancer?

Exposure to the Island's energy.

&gt;Why did the Island not heal Ben's tumor, young Ben's gunshot wound and Jack's appendix?

No clue.

true,istara,australia,Australia,"&gt; I think Oxbridge should take the best students they can find - regardless of background or what school they attended.

This is what they are desperately trying to do. The dons don't want rich mediocre kids. They want the brightest minds. 

But one of the biggest problems is getting poorer children - and their teachers - to even apply in the first place.

EDIT:  there's another potentially contentious reason for the disparity.  If you take two children of moderate innate ability and one is educated intensively and very well from the age or two or three (eg taught to read at that stage) and the other has a poor education, and is barely literate by age eleven, then it is likely that the poorly educated child *will never perform as well* as the other one, whatever training and education they get in their later years.

As human beings we do have certain windows of capacity for learning.  We know that early life stimulation is critical for infant devlopment.  We know, from the sad study of feral children and unassisted/undiagnosed deaf children, that people who don't learn language by a certain age will never have a full capability for it.  We certainly know this is true of foreign languages and fluency/multilingualism.  It may also be true of numeracy, and related logic skills.

I don't think it's much of a stretch to hypothesise that a shitty education sadly results on average in dumber people, not just less-well educated people.  And *this is of course not fair or right*.

It's also why it's more important to reform education so that poorer children with potential and ability get the chance to have a decent education, than fret about university entrance when they're eighteen.

Nearly every single show requires a measure of willful suspension of disbelief.

Evidently the idea of something having an effect on time which resonates through history and affects a race by speeding up their progression breaks your willful suspension of disbelief. Does that mean it doesn't make sense? No. It just means *you're* not willing to accept it as a valid explanation.

We've always had the explanation that time is fluid and ever-changing. That time is almost like something alive. It bucks when something hurts it and responds in kind. Time can break. Time can fail. Time *is* reality. So why can't it alter reality? It's not even altering the basis of reality. It's just speeding a race's natural progression. Something which should have taken *hundreds of years* takes a relatively short amount of time. That seems perfectly reasonable to me when time is responding to something happens that affects it.

Some events are bound to happen. They are ""time locked"" if you will. It stands to reason as well that some progressions in time are also time locked. If the events of ""The Waters of Mars"" *must happen no matter what,* why can't it also be true that the Ood evolving to the point they were at in ""The End of Time"" is something which *must happen no matter what,* but merely happened *a lot faster?*

Did you mean ""[Arpad Pusztai](http://www.freenetpages.co.uk/hp/a.pusztai/)""?

Either way, yes there are resonances, but that does not mean their cases are the same. Both involved areas of massive public anxiety and were taken up and pushed one way or the other by the media. Both involved unreliably small sample sizes (I went back and read Pusztai's Lancet article, it's been a while. He used 6 rats in each group!). Both studies have not been replicated (as far as I can tell). Both seem to have been wrong. Both attacked business interests, who seem to have been involved in campaigning against Pusztai, less certainly against Wakefield.

Here is where the cases separate. Wakefield's grandstanding against MMR has caused significant risk to children from measles. Most of the reaction against him was from not from business but from people with healthcare responsibiities who were petrified that herd immunity would collapse. There has in fact been some increase in measles cases since then. He actually had massive business interests on his side, the media were selling thousands on the back of him, but he was still wrong.  He seems to have used it to push personal interests, Pusztai seems to have behaved with dignity. Wakefield has been found guilty by his professional body of dishonesty, Pusztai has not as far as I can tell (if so I could do with the link, cheers). 

Basically I am fed up with the canard that if you speak out against an established line then you will be ruthlessly be squashed by vested interests. It has an element of truth since they will defend those interests and may do so ruthlessly, but if you have the advantage of actually being right on your side then in the end you will probably be vindicated. Science careers are built by showing that you are right and someone else is wrong.

(excerpted from Wikipedia)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_associative_memory
Holographic Associative Memory is part of the family of analog, correlation-based, associative, stimulus-response memories, where information is mapped onto the phase orientation of complex numbers operating. It can be considered as a complex valued artificial neural network. The holographic associative memory exhibits some remarkable characteristics. Holographs have been shown to be effective for associative memory tasks, generalization, and pattern recognition with changeable attention. Ability of dynamic search localization is central to natural memory. For example, in visual perception, humans always tend to focus on some specific objects in a pattern. Humans can effortlessly change the focus from object to object without requiring relearning. It provides a computational model which can mimic this ability by creating representation for focus. At the heart of this new memory lies a novel bi-modal representation of pattern and a hologram-like complex spherical weight state-space. Besides the usual advantages of associative computing, this technique also has excellent potential for fast optical realization because the underlying hyper-spherical computations can be naturally implemented on optical computations.",0,1274769529,null,0,false,0,c0qphpr,t3_c77hi,t1_c0qphpr,t3_c77hi,null,1426319239,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,lhnz,null,null,"&gt; There is a short and simple solution, first proposed 11 years ago by the journalist Peter Wilby. Oxford and Cambridge, he suggested, should offer places to the top one or two pupils from every school, regardless of grades. The next-best universities would offer places to the pupils who come third and fourth, and so on downwards. There would be some adjustment for the size of the school, but the brutal logic holds.


That's an incredibly stupid suggestion. The top pupils from some schools aren't even half as clever enough to get in, nor do they all have the required knowledge...

What about pupils that don't make the cut of two, what if a school has 10 pupils with the ability to get into Oxford? This is not unlikely -- many top schools have ultra intelligent pupils. Are they expected to move to a school which hasn't filled its 'quota'?

&gt; As Nick Davies's investigation of the schools crisis in the Guardian showed, the overwhelming reason why some schools fail is that ""the bright middle-class children are being siphoned off into private schools and a minority of state schools … The system fails because it is segregated.""


The problem is that intelligent students fail, get bullied and underachieve when they are put in a culture of anti-intellectualism that thrives in bad schools. If you don't segregate say goodbye to the achievements of those students...

Secondly, however, the interviews allow the candidate to demonstrate their abilities and knowledge even if their grades aren't entirely stellar. The issue of applying based solely on grades (as is done in Ontario, for instance) is that grades are necessarily reductive, and candidates who are from middle-to-upper-class families are more likely to have higher grades than their lower- and middle-class peers, if only because they usually do not have to worry about working and supporting themselves and others financially throughout their school years. 

As far as the entrance exams go, I think that it can act as another way for candidates with somewhat sub-par grades to demonstrate their abilities, although I would agree that these exams are a hassle for students, and, like most exams, do not necessarily offer an accurate representation of a student's abilities. 

Although it may give students more to worry about, I think that having a more thorough application process is actually better for students and allows the university to have a better chance of selecting the best possible candidates. I think that if people are encouraged to apply, they won't be stopped by the complex application. The problem is that upper-class private schools offer a huge amount of encouragement and coaching to their students on how to get in, while it usually takes a very giving teacher or counselor to assist and encourage students to apply in state schools where students are mostly of lower-class backgrounds. Oxford has made serious attempts to encourage more students from lower-class backgrounds to apply, however, including target schools programmes, student mentoring, etc, and I think that these things will have an impact over time. 

EDIT: Also, I think that this proposal is horrific if only because it would create a tremendously competitive atmosphere in schools all over the country. If students know that only 2 people will get into Oxford from their school, there will be insane competition for those two spots. Also, what would you do with candidates who are able, but, for personal reasons, are unable to achieve well academically?

The only problem with interviews is the difficulty in doing so many, if it were possible obviously every applicant should be interviewed, but sadly there are logistical limits.

Well, from what Oxford did, it seems they effectively chose based on the grades from the one entrance exam. I think that was wrong, maybe entrance exams do have some use as an additional resource to the interview. But I think just basing it all on an additional exam, covering topics which aren't on the a-level syllabus and so aren't really taught in state school, is terribly unfair. Still it's their loss in the long run I suppose.

Actually yeah, I might agree with you on the application dates being a good thing now. Since you have less applicants, and so it is easer to interview them all and give everyone a fair chance, since people only apply if they are quite serious about it.

Sadly, even bright pupils at shit schools are going to struggle to get A grades at A-level, because it is still so much syllabus box-ticking in terms of marks.  Your school/teachers screw that up, and you're screwed.

Obviously there's a lower barrier to entry to blogging (which means a higher *proportion* of crap), but there's no upper limit on professionalism or journalistic integrity, so the best bloggers are easily a match for the best professional journalists in terms of accuracy and impartiality.

Moreover, bloggers are usually highly motivated and subject to no bias but their own (which is often fairly obvious with a little research)... whereas stories in the mainstream media are a complex mishmash of the biases of the individual reporter, their editor and the organisational bias of the organ they write for. This makes bias harder to wheedle out, although to be fair currently most print newspapers *do* do us all a favour and pretty much wear their partiality on their sleeves for all to see.

With the rise of the internet and many:many communication we've swapped one problem for another.  Previously we were too information-poor, and had to make do with a restricted number of highly biased sources.  Now we're information-rich, and instead of having too few sources of information we have more than we can comfortably accommodate, often containing wildly conflicting biases.

However, buried in the mountains of chaff are nuggets of gold as good (in fact, due to the minimisation of external corrupting influences, arguably *better*) than anything Old Media used to offer.  Don't fall into the trap of assuming that just because 99% of something is crap, that means *all of it* is crap.  Those heuristics worked well before the internet and the idea of the ""long tail"" came about... but now it just means you wrongly dismiss whole systems, offering their very *strengths* as reasons to dismiss them. &lt;:-)

Instead, we should realise that although 99% of blogging (for example) is self-indulgent crap, the other 1% is pure gold, equal to or better than anything we ever had before.

We shouldn't disregard blogging (or any other such system) because it's largely rubbish - instead we should just try harder to upgrade our filtering mechanisms to extract more of the good stuff and less of the rubbish.

For example, in the next few years we should see the proliferation of sites where people can post links to blogs, allowing each other to help collaboratively filter for good material.  After that, we might even see sites which allow commenting on the stories, so we can quickly and easily assess and debate each article's reliability and merit as a group, in one place, instead of having to register a blog each and have some sort of stilted, decentralised discussion over the course of days!

Does any of this sound familiar? ;-)

More seriously, the key things to remember is that these filtering and merit-determining systems are still in their very early infancy - we've literally only really been at this for 5-10 years or so, and already we have massive, distributed efforts like Wikipedia (with an error rate slightly better than the Encyclopaedia Britannica), [collaborative content promotion and analysis systems like reddit](http://philosophtly.blogspot.com/2009/01/engines-of-reason.html), and already (if you use it correctly, subscribe to good subreddits and read each article's comments/follow-up stories) it's doing a pretty good job of separating the unreliable, sensationalist and dishonest from the timely, accurate and verifiable.

TL;DR: Just because the *majority* of something is crap, that doesn't mean anything as long as you have good enough filtering mechanisms.  We're *already* producing pretty damn good filtering mechanisms (although most people are scarcely aware they're even part of one), and those mechanisms will only get better with time, and as more people cotton on.

Still TL;DR: Judge long-tail systems by their best output, not their average, or you miss the entire point of long-tail systems. ;-)",0,1274796185,null,0,false,0,c0qpzjm,t3_c7tzo,t1_c0qpzjm,t1_c0qptnv,null,1426319470,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

I first really heard about Doctor who by reading General Protection Fault, in it's early days, in 1998. I actually started reading it when it was less than 1 month old, but I stopped reading most webcomics about a year ago.

I watched the Doctor Who movie at some point before 2004. I had downloaded it from the Internet probably using  Napster or Kazaa, but I was uterly confused by it. It looked boring, so I didn't catch on or investigate further.

In 2004 or so, I started reading about it from fan pages (and the early version of Wikipedia) and I actually watched ""Robot"" and ""The Ark in Space"" which I found on the Internet.

I downloaded ""An Unearthly Child"" but ended up never watching it (I still haven't seen it).

In 2005, a friend in Florida (we met on the Internet, but also speak on the phone) told me I should watch the new series on the CBC and that he was jealous I could watch it.

In 2006, I started using Torrents rather a lot, and discovered that Doctor Who was available, so I downloaded Series 1 and 2 and watched them one after another and was hooked by the 2nd episode (thought I now find it rather boring compared to the rest of the first 4 seasons).

When I meet the 10th Doctor, I was a major fan and kept pushing people to follow it.

I downloaded the 3th season in ""real time"", and ever since for Torchwood and Sarah Jane too.

During the 4th season, I found the first 3 seasons on the Internet in DVD format with the French Language. I showed them to my Daughter and my wife and they both loved it.

By the time we finished the 3rd season, the 4th wasn't in French yet, so I showed a few episodes of Sarah Jane to my daughter, translating it live (it less complicated, so it's easier).

My then 6.5 years old daughter saw the first season but by the middle of the 2nd season, she found it too boring and asked ""If I can follow Sarah Jane in English, why not Doctor who ?""

I had found subtitles for it, and in the week before we decided to watch the season 4 first episode, the DVD in French for the 4th season was leaked and I downloaded it.

The second Region 1 DVDs with Doctor in French AND English are released, I am buying them, like I do for most of the series I love.

But I refuse to buy Region 1 DVDs of a show my daughter loves in English only, especially since there are Region 2 DVDs available in French.

I now have my own 10th Doctor costume, along with a sonic screwdriver, chuck all-star shoes (red) and a coat which kinda fits with the 10th doctor.

The show was certainly simpler then, and sometimes laughably cheap, but nothing has come close to the performances of Hartnell and Troughton in my opinion. Hartnell, though only sixty or so, could wear this deep gaze that made him seem impossibly ancient, and Troughton's trickster character overlying a deep and caring core has formed the basis for most of the doctors since (especially the last two,) but none can do it better than him.

And the sense of mystery surrounding the doctor could never be reattained once they had introduced Gallifrey in full, and talked about the doctor's schoolboy days (People often forget that until the last episode of season six, the doctor's planet of origin and race had never even been mentioned.)

In the first episode we have him sternly mocking Ian and Barbara's lack of smarts and understanding and treating them like ants. Then near the end of season 2 we have him obviously missing Ian and Barbara, and in the episode I linked, he says that both Vicki and Steven are ""very welcome"" companions.

By scientist of his generation I mean before business interests had a stranglehold on nearly all areas of academia and research.     Unfavourable results are not released to the public because they are classified as confidential business information.  Surprisingly this also is implemented in civil service science.        Mr Pusztai has suffered a serious stroke that many believe was a result of the stress resultant from his career loss after years of dedicated not to mention very profitable service.                 No amount of money or 'glory' can compensate for the loss of health.    I fail to understand how Mr Pusztai, a well respected scientist at the Rowett Institute methodology is questionable.   In order to be awarded the 1.6 million pound funding to investigate the safety of GMO competing against 27 others, I seriously doubt that the methodology of the research was not given stringent oversight prior to entrustment.   Six rats in experiment????   I am going to try and find the Lancet article but I think you must have misinterpreted it.                 If that were the case then he would not have been awarded the research.                                                 He appeared on a channel documentary for less than two minutes expressing concern over the need for further vigorous testing prior to the introduction of GMO.    Very quickly he was unceremoniously given the boot.    Monsanto were a 'little bit upset.'  After that, he was accused of every misdemeanour under the sun.    Are you under the impression that Monsanto who lobby and support political parties financially in the U.S  gave a damn about the integrity?                In reading this, do not make the error that I am against any development of GMO.  The fact is that inadequate testing was undertaken prior to introduction into the human and animal food chain.   
To entrust public health to companies who's main loyalty is to profit and their shareholders is pure folly.
I strongly contest your arguement that Science careers are built upon proving that you are right and someone else is wrong.  That may have been the case fifty years ago.    Today, if a scientist undertaking research funded usually in some manner by agrobusiness interests, it appears that coming up with the 'wrong' answer, unfavourable results is not something that can be disclosed.           In fact if a scientist works in the civil service, they are never allowed to disclose to the public unfavourable findings.

What started out as a bit of snark in *Whoville* has become a genuine interest in what you're saying. 

What about people who are trained to specifically ignore it like people who dive into burning buildings as part of the job? What about hostage negotiators? CIA operatives in foreign lands? Secret Service agents? SWAT teams? People who are faced with a dangerous situation and then purposefully choose to become part of it. I get that a large part of that is of a similar vein that you're talking about, but, surely, the ability to execute a complicated plan of action involves higher brain function. And then, since we're here what happens when that plan misfires and improvisation steps in? 

I'm having a hard time saying what I mean, but I guess what my question boils down to is how is it that people manage to make what superficially look like logical decisions in the face of overwhelming threat? 

A firefighter, for instance, has no idea what he'll find in the middle of a burning building and yet it seems that, for the most part, they seem to make logical decisions in traversing the inferno to find people to save. I don't think these guys and gals are busting things up willy-nilly hoping that the next door they knock down or the wall they throw themselves into is the right one. They know what fire does, how it moves, what it likes, etc. and then make logical, conscious decisions to initiate action. Surely there's some instinct involved, but is that all? If they are thinking rationally and staying in parasympathetic mode are they not threatened by the fire...or the building collapsing...or...whatever?

But I'm sure you would agree that the way the TARDIS works is not something which the writers must explain in-depth beyond, ""It travels through the time vortex.""

So, too, is this circumstance something which should not need an in-depth explanation beyond, ""Time ripples sped up the natural evolution of their species.""

I understand the difference you're making beyond an explanation and an in-depth explanation (even though I think you're rather horrible at expressing that difference).

&gt; **The Doctor**: Do you know like we were saying, about the earth revolving? It's like when you're a kid, the first time they tell you that the world is turning and you just can't quite believe it 'cause everything looks like it's standing still. I can feel it...

&gt;[he takes her hand]

&gt;**The Doctor**: - the turn of the earth. The ground beneath our feet is spinning at a thousand miles an hour. The entire planet is hurtling around the sun at sixty seven thousand miles an hour. And I can feel it. We're falling through space, you and me, clinging to the skin of this tiny little world. And, if we let go...

&gt;[He releases her hand]

&gt;**The Doctor**: That's who I am. Now forget me, Rose Tyler. Go home. 

Well, then I was hooked, but I still had no means of consumption. I devoured all the information I could about the show on wikipedia (It was welll into the third series of the revival, so I spoiled quite a bit for myself), and then I finally found some good places to stream and watched the whole series in the first few weeks of the summer after my junior year of college. The Specials were the first episodes I watched where I didn't know what was going to happen next, and I spent more and more time on forums and wikis and r/doctorwho trying to figure out what was going to happen next. In the interim, when we were waiting for Elevensies, I delved into back-catalogs on Netflix Instant Watch. Trying to sample as much of each Doctor as I could. And now here I am, getting the new episodes as soon as I can and actually being involved with a television show for the first time in years.

I wasn't a die hard fan then, but I did enjoy the show.

Then when I was a little older and in junior high, my best friend and I discovered a mutual love of both Doctor Who and Hitchhiker's Guide (which my dad also introduced me to when it first came out as a book), and I got more seriously into fandom with her.  I kept watching and being a serious fan until the end of the Peter Davison run, when none of my local PBS stations were carrying the show anymore.  So I never really saw any of the later old school Doctors (other than maybe one episode of Colin Baker, once that I happened to stumble onto).  And I never saw the earlier ones either.

But I was totally there when Eccleston showed up in my bittorrent list, and have been there every show since, waiting patiently for it to pop up and download. :-)  And I got my mom and stepfather watching it too, now.

Occasionally we do see evidence of scorched flattened crop inside certain circles. The electromagnetic fields of both the underground springs and the descending force work in harmony or conjunction with each other.

Yeah, nice change there. Using their own numbers, 250,000 families constitutes 1.1% of all families, or to put it in the terms they used earlier, 1 in 100. So 99% of families won't give a fuck.

This is a proper ticket from the area I work in, Theatre and Circus. This is not a dodgy deal, I work at the Festival and have a guest ticket allocation. You would be my personal guest, and would be able to camp, plus park a caravan or motorhome in our very nice secure camping area. I could probably arrange for a power hookup as well. We are talking proper luxury and a very nice backstage bar, plus a very nice green room with decent catering etc. etc.

It's very nice in our bit and people love to camp with us. The people camping in our area are performers working in the Theatre Tent, Cabaret, Circus Big Top, T&amp;C Green Room Bar, Outside Circus Stage etc. etc. 

Here's what I want in return. I'm short of one nice caravan for me and my wife to stay in while I'm working at the show. I would like something nice, not too small, something that your aunt might stay in :-)

So, if you can find me a nice caravan/camper and loan it to me from Friday 18th June to Monday 5th July (I need it both sides of the actual event for work reasons) then I will give you a ticket for the Festy, plus a vehicle pass and backstage T&amp;C laminates for you and any immediate others who might like to hang out at your place. I promise to look after your kit properly and would pay for any damage in the unlikely event etc. etc.

Any takers?

* Non-humans disguised as humans. Prisoner Zero, the half-Smilers, Dr. Bracewell, the Saturnyne.
* Things not being what they look like in general. The good-looking food keeps tasting disgusting, the crack in the wall is a crack in space, the starship UK isn't powered by engines, the Daleks aren't an Allied weapon, Octavian says River isn't what she seems, the statues aren't statues and the trees are machines.
* They know they're [missing something](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/c2o29/what_a_perception_filter_never_seen_one_of_those/c0pslnd?context=2), but they can't figure out what: the perceptual filter in Amy's house, the lack of pictures in the Angel diary, the statues having only one head.
* Memories or minds being manipulated: people on the UK erase their own memories, Bracewell's memories are false, the Angels made Amy hallucinate and people lose their memories of people who fall into the crack.
** [This post](http://community.livejournal.com/doctorwho/6177907.html) talks about ""the importance of memory"" as one of the recurring themes.

Also:

* ""Did he do the thing?"" and ""I'll do a thing"" seem oddly parallel, but maybe no more so than ""basically, run"" and ""basically, I rule"".

true,TheUKLibertarian,null,null,"Without trying to sound ridiculously controversial for its own sake, I actually think being falsely accused of rape to the point that everybody knows about it is AS BAD as actually being raped, long term. Obviously being raped is horrendous, but in time, most people get over it, and everybody will sympathise with you and help you get through it.

If you're falsely accused of rape you could potentially have an entire community set against you, attacking you fucking with you. If you are wrongly imprisoned you will be beaten in prison most likely, occasionally to death. Even if, more likely, you don't get done, your reputation will be forever tarnished. Many people will always be thinking ""where there's smoke there's fire"" and wary of you. People will forever be saying ""that guy got accused of rape""... It's a very scary prospect.

And it's EASIER for a female to come up with a false rape story than it is for a woman to be raped if she is taking sensible steps to avoid it (not to excuse a rapist of course, but just to point out how very easy it is to accuse somebody of something).

So with that all said not only do I think this is a senible and just new law, but that the crime for being caught falsely accusing somebody of rape should be equal to the crime of actually committing rape, and similarly stigmatised in society. Lying about such a serious issue is a horrible insult to those who have actually been hurt by rape.

true,ragewind,uk,,"that was a sarcastic comparison of the other extreme that can and is used by some police. 
yes police usually restrain from any large scale use of force but do read the article the officers were under attack in a vehicle.
the options for the officers in side said vehicle are rather limited either sit back and wait for back up in a quantity sufficient to deal with the crowd or try dealing with the attackers which would require large risk of injury to them and the attackers.
for any detention the police use a large ratio of officers to detain to ensure the safe detention of the suspect and safety to the officers.
that would have meant several riot vans and large numbers of officers to catch some kids this would have ""noched up"" the situation greatly and been futile as kids are really ever punished due to age. thus encouraging the kids to do it again for the effect same reason they go about attacking other emergency services to get a reaction with little chance of real risk to them.

""out of the box"" that is kind of the defection of using music to defuse a situation, dont think anyone will find that in any police manual.

""the armalite"" what do you mean by that all a Google brings up is a weapons manufacturer.

what problems with police would that be? this site should surely prove that our police are one of the better forces around, weekly there are reports from the US linked on here that report gross abuses and over reactions that have lead to many serious injures or worse.

We had the 2nd largest navy in the world, more than an order of magnitude above germany's so landing would have to defeat or force back the royal navy which would be difficult to say the least. Germany's landing force consisted of a large amount of tug boats and small civilian transports hardly capable of making a military attack. We also bombed this at one point knocking off a quarter of it's strength when it tried to organise.

On top of that we had air parity so germany would be under constant air attack while attempting a landing. Our air force although getting badly damaged by the luftwaffe had a tactical advantage in the sense that we could come from short distances with radar coverage. Our main strategic disadvantage was that we couldn't actually stop bombing raids of the airfields easily so we would have had to move the air force further north limiting it's ability to operate as effectively.

As for the military landing itself. Germany would only have been able to land about 6 divisions (or so) at once. These men would be against 16 divisions of our own in defensive positions with artillery batteries in range. 

And to finish not only do they have all of these disadvantages but it would of gotten more and more difficult the further you go in time. In early 1940 a landing with a small, competent force could have established a beachhead and advanced a fair way into Britain. It would not be a success and the navy would have to be absent but with surprise it's a strong maybe. However, by 1941 we had drawn in at least a million new men into the ranks of the army and the home guard. Britain was no France where flanking and encircling with panzers proved victorious.

If we'd had this obvious solution all along there'd have been no need to build a Parliament in Scotland, Wales, spend all the money on the buildings, MPs themselves and the increases in beaurocracy.

Taxation will *always* be ""unfair"" because its in the nature of our society to redirect spending from where the people are generating huge amounts of money ie The City and the oil generating parts of Scotland to elsewhere- this thing about England 'stealing' Scotland's oil or Scotland 'stealing' England's tax is ridiculous.

Scotland is generally less wealthy than certain parts of England, ditto with Wales. More taxation is spent in these areas to try and ensure our country has some semblance of equality in public services and opportunity.

No one's stealing anything- we have an antiquated and ridiculous democratic system which causes these financial inequalities which *all* countries and states have to be reflected in our politics.

I realise its a little too late now, but what do the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish redditors think of rather than having their own Parliamnetary buildings, we just had everything in Westminster but only allowed MPs to vote in their respective devolved matters?

I can absolutely get behind that idea. It would be fantastic if there was a ""Class T"" for substances with established rules for how and when they can/must be re-classified or re-legalised; that's not how it currently works, though. Once illegal, it's *extremely* unlikely for the drug to ever be ""declassified"", irrespective of what harm it's found to cause.

In other words, Mervin King is a civil servant. The politicians (the Chancellor in this case) make the policy decisions, and the financial experts make them happen and provide feedback on the results.

There are plenty of experts who give advice to the chancellor on financial matters, but its the politicians who decide what to set tax rates at as they are the ones who answer to the public.

Likewise with drugs, when there is public outcry over a perceived dangerous substance the politicians need to react.
