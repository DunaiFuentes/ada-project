To me, having a Dalek beg for mercy helps flush out the Dalek character from being stereotypical ""Space Nazis"" (they can reason again and experience fear). 

Too often, Daleks become simple tools of the plot, screaming ""Exterminate"", shooting a few random NPCs and failing to exterminate the Doctor.

A lot of the apparently touristy stuff is really worth seeing - go to the Brtisih Museum, the Tate (both of them), the National Gallery, the Science Museum, the Natural History Museum, the Victoria and Albert... Allow at least a day for each (actually you can do both Tates in a day if you stick to the free permnanent collections, but you can spend a week in the British Museum, so that kinda makes up for it!). Watch out for feral school trips and packs of tourists though

Also - people: Because of the population density, people's personal space in London tends to be smaller than anywhere else I have been, and the emotional walls between strangers are thicker.

Get an Oyster card, learn the tube (it is not that hard, just learn the colours and learn to look for the exit sign or the change line colour when you get off a train) and know your North/South - relative location.

OK, so basically: Cable is faster than DSL, DSL speeds are affected by distance from exchange and line quality. At peak hours the internet is slower, at off-peak hours it is faster. Speed is also affected by the ISP package you're using i.e. a slower package is slower than a faster package and vice versa. When you're using a browser, download speeds don't matter so much as when you're actually downloading things.

Right, thanks, got that. 

Can I also add that changing the DNS server of your ISP to something like OpenDNS will dramatically cure the peak time slowdown that you see from your ISP under normal browsing conditions, and that moving to BeThere.com will dramatically improve everything else. 

On more thing as regards LLU: Why, when my line is unbundled to another ISP, do I still have to pay line rental to BT when I use the line solely for internet usage ... what am I actually paying BT for here?

I've been a regular for years and have seen a load of big names come through there. When the comedy is rubbish the heckling is good.

2) A lot of places do great talks of an evening. Sure the museums are good but places like the Royal Society do talks almost every week that are great. Last year's highlight was ""the science of beer"" followed by a beer tasting.

3) So many courses on in London at any point in time. I've just registered for one of the Astronomy Courses at the Royal Observatory. Cheap as chips and looks great. Alternatively you could learn French at the Academie Francaise near Sloane Square. 

4) It is very expensive to eat out. I've started getting vouchers for places like Zizzi and ask from sites like quidco and vouchercodes. Just means I can go out an extra time in a month.

5) Visit the House of Commons for Prime Minister's Question Time. When you have found a flat just write to your MP and they will get you tickets. It's free and very exciting.

**Making Thyself Jolly**:

* subscribe to the Timeout email newsletter - the best way to find out about free/awesome/sometimes kinky/nontouristy things to do around town.

* there are three reasons to check what's going on on the many amazing university campuses in London [the London School of Economics (LSE), School of Oriental and Asian Studies (SOAS), University College London (UCL), Imperial College]: (1) most have campus pubs which sell drinks for oh-so-very-cheap. (2) all have fantastic free public lectures from Nobel prize winners and such personas - sometimes those free lectures are followed by free wine-and-cheese discussions (3) there's always something fun going on campus from crazy political protest and student salsa parties to free tickets to see student productions of the Vagina Monologues. 

* if you are in London around Christmas, check out [SantaCon pub crawl](http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=london+santacon+2009&amp;m=tags).

**Getting To and Fro** 

* the tube is so damn expensive so get an Oyster card (a student one is better, if it applies). Get to know the area because a lot of times it's quicker to walk than to take the tube. Become intimately acquainted with this bad boy: http://www.tfl.gov.uk/ Check the website for any tube interruption updates before  leaving the house if you are planning to use the tube (ESPECIALLY if you need to go/come from the airport with a back-breaking amount of bags). Learn how to use the buses -it's convenient and cheap but only for short journeys.

**Eat and Drink**

* A patron saint of students should be named after the Sainsbury's grocery store - cheap, convenient, and available everywhere. Bento Box  (delish japanese carry out) has all its food 50% off after 8pm (at least in central London). All pubs I've been to have been amazing, but no one can make a good martini... don't even try to explain what vermouth is to a bartender. 

**Finally...**

* GET OUT OF THE HOUSE! London weather is as bad as you've heard. It is very easy to  become  unmotivated/melancholy/unenthused/saddened/depressed/ by this weather and end up not doing anything exciting. Don't stay in and mop around your house alone. Get out and enjoy stuff, no matter how shitty the weather gets.

I went with almost no knowledge of the play and laughed myself senseless.  

Some other advice: 

* Car/Bus/Taxi journeys will take a lot longer than you'd expect.  Whilst you should master the tubes of course, learn to love buses as well because often the time overhead of going down and up again for the tubes will make the buses a better option.

* Everyone's right about Oyster cards but for goodness' sake make sure you *always* to touch in and out; penalties for forgetting are disproportionate.  

* Should you find yourself in Brentford, make a point of finding [The Lord Nelson](http://thelordnelsonbrentford.co.uk) which is a small but perfect pub with great food.  

* Walk along the South Bank on a warm evening with a date.  When the trees light up (they have these blue LEDs in them), I think it's an incredibly romantic place.  Sadly, I went without a date (I work in London Monday-Friday but my wife and family are about 200 miles away) and it was just depressing :-(

Or a Google/Outlook calendar or whatever. Everything you could possibly want to do is happening somewhere in London and you should make the most of it, but don't be surprised if you have something planned for every night of the week before it's even started. The pace of life in London is pretty unrelenting and it's important to keep track or you'll start missing things. Also, make sure you block out the occasional weekend to just do nothing and recover.

Walk.

The tube is great when you need to get somewhere in a hurry, but you'll never learn your way around London if you use it all the time. Zone 1 is smaller than you think and London's actually a really interesting city to walk around. My rule of thumb (inside Zone 2 anyway) is to walk any journey that's would be fewer than three stops on the tube. Taking the bus is good too: You can learn your way around a bit more because you can see where you're going (also, if you're heading home in the early morning, the night bus is your best friend). If you know where you're going to be working and can find somewhere to live that's within walking distance then you're laughing (even if it costs you a bit more in rent, it's worth it for the convenience and saving of transport costs).

Do not run a car.

I enjoy driving but in London the roads are horrible, public transport is great, and life is expensive enough without running a car. If you really do need to drive from time to time, you're better off joining a car club like [streetcar](http://www.streetcar.co.uk) - they have a huge number of new and well-kept VW Polos and also quite a few vans (handy when you need to move).

Breathe

One of the most liberating things about living in this city is being able to ditch the cost of the money pit that is car ownership.  
  
Seriously... I love to drive, but fuck car ownership. Insurance, maintenance, MOT, security, environmental concerns. I don't understand the desire to own one when the average car driving speed in London is slower than someone on a bike. (Get a bike!)  
  
London is for pedestrians and has one of the best connected, integrated public transport systems in Europe. (Although you won't hear a Londoner admit that while they grumble that they have to wait 3 minutes for the next tube)  
  
Oh, and if you rely on public transport, you'll never have to worry about how many pints you put away again! ...as as Irishman, surely you can appreciate that ;)
  
I could understand it if you were planning on driving out of London frequently to, for instance, visit your Nan in Shropshire... otherwise. ditch the car and become a Londoner.

&gt; I very much doubt that River Song is the Rani. Moffatt would not reveal her to be an old character, and leave half of his audience, who are new to show, thinking ""wtf, who?"".

I would really hope this would be true.  I haven't seen any of the classic Doctor Who, and am only mildly familiar with it through reading various forums and browsing Wikipedia.  I imagine there'd be a lot of confusion with this, unless it's very carefully explained.  It's possible, though.

That comment continues:
&gt; People asume thats she is going to be someone else in disguise or something. But is it possible River Song could just be... River Song? When we find out who she is, it means, we find out he she is TO THE DOCTOR. As it was said in Silence in the Library. 

I think I'd actually prefer it if she was someone new, and had her own reasons for pursuing the Doctor as she has instead of bringing someone back from the old episodes  and trying to find explanation for why they're back.  I don't think she'd be his wife, either.  I imagine having a relationship where your timelines are basically opposite of each other would be incredibly difficult.

The arguments put into that, about River being a Time Lord, is very compelling- especially the points about knowing the Doctor's language and his name.  I wouldn't imagine a non-Time Lord would be able to acquire that knowledge easily.

Great, I thought. Politicians should be skeptical when unsure, and follow the evidence that is provided by authoritative sources. However, all three of these politicians went back on this within 30 minutes of saying it, when I asked whether homeopathic products should be available on the NHS, even though (and I tried to make this as clear as I could) EVERY medical authority worth a damn put them as no more effective as a placebo. All three of these politicians said that they would 'keep an open mind'. Chloe Smith even went as far as saying that 'plenty of local businesses are making decent profit from homeopathy and other alternative treatments' leaving the implication there that it's ok to sell this stuff as long as people are buying it (which brought to mind those wonderful Palladium watches we used to be able to buy!).

2-She did not regenerate when she died in SITL.  Even if it was her last regeneration this entire premise assumes the doctor knows who/what she is based on knowing his true name.  There would have definitely been some kind of dialog between the two referencing ""You'll regenerate!""  ""No I won't!""  ""Oh noes!"" or something. 

3-The Doctor is aware of other living non-Chameleon Arch'd Time Lords.  He knows he's alone.  River seems to know exactly who and what she is so she's not hidden in any way.  Thus, The Doctor would have sensed her presence long before Silence.

&gt;River Song is a Professor (formerly a Doctor) and the Rani was a scientist.

River is an archeologist.  Rani is a chemist.  Not even a correlation there


&gt;The name Rani means “she is singing; queen” (hence River Song). It also means “wife of a
&gt; rajah” (which could mean The Doctor’s wife) and “a reigning queen or princess in her own
&gt; right”.

How does ""wife of a king"" become ""The Doctor's wife"" that's a pretty huge leap


&gt;She is almost certainly a Gallifreyan.

because...??  Pure opinion here.


&gt;In The Time of Angels, Octavian tells the Doctor that “You think you know [River], but you 
&gt;don’t. You don’t understand who or what she is”.

Yes, he said that.  Very vague statement.  How does this relate to the Rani?  


&gt;She has a TARDIS shaped diary which she doesn’t let the Doctor read because it contains
&gt;“spoilers” to do with The Doctor’s future life. It also contains photographs of all of The
&gt;Doctor’s incarnations and future ones too.

Yes.  she does.   How does this relate to the Rani?

They did use an adjective to describe the rise as something more than just 1%.  You may quibble with one man's explosion is another man's miniscule event.  In relation to trends however, the rise is pretty dramatic.  The only bone that I had was that its not that big of deal considering that the rest of the world is also growing very quickly.  I suppose that the crux of the article is that England is expected to have a larger population than other European nations (though I think that Ukraine is technically in Europe) and that part is new and a change.

Your point is better served in the US coverage of the Gulf Oil Spill. They call it ""the biggest oil disaster in US history"" when, in fact, the number of sea creatures and birds killed is quite small so far compared to the Exxon Valdez incident.  It is the largest oil spill, but so far is not the worst disaster in terms of wildlife. They also talked incessantly about ""oil on the beaches"" when, in fact, the amount of oil on the beaches was relatively small and quickly cleaned up.  But, they created an economic disaster by scaring tourists away from places like Pensacola, Gulf  Shores and Panama City which except for a couple of days of some tar balls, really didn't get that much oil on the beach.  But, you'd never know from the coverage.

I would have been much happier if Davies had actually brought Gallifrey and the Time Lords back, although not with the planet right on top of Earth.  A well executed callback needs to have long-term impact.

Rasillon having caused the Doctor to regenerate but the Doctor having banished the planet across the universe temporarily... all of that even untouched in Moffat's season would have made things so much more poignant:  These are the consequences of undoing the Time War.  All of those enemies converging to unmake the Doctor.

Then after he reboots the universe and deals with the Silence, there's Rasillon itching to make him regenerate again.

Oh well.  I suppose it could still happen.

This makes me sad...

PhD students are paid like enough to just about eat and stuff, I don't know if you have enough time to have many hobbies/interests but I doubt they could afford them on such miserly stipends in any case.

Post-doc salaries are abysmal in the US, and still pretty poor in the UK. They are much better in the EU (the UK doesn't pay the same as the EU because we opt out of lots of their policies - yay Thatcherism) but then it is mainly the  small number of post-doc places versus PhD students and the short-term nature of the employment that makes it difficult to have job security.

I think it shows how out of touch the politicians are when you see Willets say that Space and Dinosaurs will enthuse Children with the scientific spirit and get the UK more scientists. But it doesn't matter what reasons we give children to choose to go into science if we give adults even greater reasons to leave.

Most people here are not 'mad' - they are incredulous that such people can have such little self awareness as to call themselves poor.

I know I am - the poorest people I've ever met have been homeless, but being homeless in the UK is still better than being homeless in a country with no access to charity or government support.

Labour are to blame for pushing fiscal policies that only made sense given their retarded belief that they had eliminated boom and bust.

We are going 5 times the size of the bail out further into debt each year. This is a serious fiscal problem that we are fortunate has been highlighted while our absolute debt is still relatively low.

Agreed.  But a much more pertinent issue and one that, in addressing it, could make a much more effective impact is the fractional reserve banking system, which is directly responsible for the overly-ambitious inflation that we've experienced.  I know Benn's not campaigning directly on contemporary banking methods, but it's frankly quite hard to get the public enthused about such dry topics.  Nonetheless, ""the poor"" are being punished for the mistakes of ""the rich"".  We're not going to see these welfare problems being directly addressed, we're going to see comprehensive cutbacks that will adversely affect many more people than those who are being talked of as problematic.
I'm not sure about your claim that 
&gt; We have families receiving 6 times the average salary in housing benefits

but there is certainly a degree of over-compensation for certain families.  On the other hand, many more people find it extremely hard to be approved for such benefits and a greater number will be negatively affected by these deep cuts than the number of problems that might be resolved.

true,Orbixx,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"They are used to incapacitate an offender when they will not come quietly and the officers cannot safely detain them by force. They are also used to prevent an offender from moving if there is a stand-off between them and the offender, or the offender and a potential victim, again especially if the officers are at risk.

Put yourself in their positions, would you rather get up close and personal with some steroid-pumped nutcase in an attempt to arrest him, or would you prefer to take him down from distance, then move in to arrest him after he has been successfully taken down safely.

Standard UK police do not carry ballistic firearms, the only ""firearms"" they carry are tasers and CS spray. They also carry an ASP retractable baton. It should also be noted that only trained officers carry tasers, so this is a genuine mistake from a trained officer, too - which will happen on rare occasions.

Not only that, but Epilepsy as a condition cannot be triggered by a taser, but of course there are other potential things it may trigger that could prove fatal, but these are all highly rare. That said, if you're causing enough of a scene to cause officers to fire a taser at you, then you probably have it coming. I should probably note for any Americans that the British police generally are far less trigger happy than the Americans, as the British police get away with far, far less in terms of misconduct.

As for the use of a (proper ballistic) firearm, they are only ever used in response to an offender possessing a firearm and come in the form of a specially trained armed response unit. They may also carry tasers with them for good measure, just in case they don't want to take a lethal shot if they don't have to; I also believe they carry rubber bullets for the same purpose.

I certainly would not like to be tasered, but I'd never dream of putting myself in a situation where I could/would be, thus the issue is moot.

Source? I am soon to be Special Constable and have done my due diligence.

Fan opinion is split on things like Unnatural History, History 101, and The Adventuress of Henrietta Street, but I strongly disliked the latter two - their writing style interfered with what would have otherwise been a more interesting narrative.

The audio dramas were fairly good, right up to Scherzo - after that point, they weren't *bad*, just inconsistent, and tended to be more dull than previous efforts.  Things improved a bit when they wrapped up that plot arc (The one which is introduced in Zagreus, and runs through The Next Life - I'll avoid mentioning it by name to avoid spoilers), but didn't get back to previous levels of quality until Other Lives.  The titles made specifically for BBC7, however, have been much more tightly plotted, with better pacing, clearer characterizations, and more compelling mysteries.

The DWM comics are pretty good, and there's plenty of them - Moreso than any other Doctor, in fact.  They're currently available in graphic novel format under the titles End Game, The Glorious Dead, Oblivion, and The Flood.

As for personal recommendations: Chimes of Midnight, Scherzo, The Natural History of Fear, Other Lives, Memory Lane, and The Company of Friends are all excellent audios.  For books, I'd go with Genocide, Alien Bodies, Vanderdeken's Children, The Scarlet Empress, Demontage, Unnatural History, Interference Books I &amp; II, The Blue Angel, Eater of Wasps, The Slow Empire, Anachrophobia, The Crooked World, Sometime Never, The Tomorrow Windows, and The Gallifrey Chronicles.",0,1281075868,null,0,false,0,c0w3sdi,t3_cxwuc,t1_c0w3sdi,t3_cxwuc,null,1426410734,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

&gt;Why is it necessary?  
  
This is controversial enough to be out of the scope of this thread, but:  
  
I believe in effective governing through [cyberocracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberocracy). I also believe that a digital record of citizen information is inevitable. People greatly fear this, but really the issue is people/government using that information for their own gains. Therefore, a system that is sufficiently closed off (Information would only be exposed to certain people, and only if certain red flags were set off) could not be abused.  
  
I know that this is extremely controversial, and I think the reason is the current centralisation of government and their decisions (with a history of inherent corruption in a political system) coupled with the fact that digitising information is new and unfamiliar (and unevolved).  
  
&gt;We currently have the lowest levels of child abuse this country has ever seen in spite of the media hyped cases.  
  
Personally I don't see this as a valid argument. Child abuse is still ongoing. Therefore there is still a problem to solve.  
  
&gt;In the end there will always be some crime. We just have to accept that.  
  
I don't personally like this argument, either... If people had that attitude in the past, we would be adversely affected now.  Surely one must aim to eradicate a problem and its sources, not just control it?  
  
&gt;Not throw absurd amounts of money trying to deal with edge cases.  
  
I definitely agree, in terms of opportunity cost - society could progress better by investing that money elsewhere.  
  
Essentially, I support the idea, but not in the way that it was implemented.  
  
If there was a low setup cost, low overhead database with data mining algorithms that spotted potential issues with child abuse, would you support it? If there was limited human interaction (i.e. input of information would be allowed, but output would be restricted unless algorithms unlocked a record to be investigated), would this satisfy people?

As a software engineer I find this idea impractical even from a purely software angle. Once you introduce the biggest vulnerability ever known, that is people, then it becomes even farcical. Software isn't good enough and never will be good enough to deal with simple misbehaviour on the part of people. The system can only be as sound as the people you put in place and people inherently cannot be trusted.

Also a system that was secure if we could trust the people involved would be much more expensive than the one currently in place. Both in terms of implementation and general running costs. To be secure the entire infrastructure would have to be vetted for flaws. We'd need to have experts ensuring that only the correct ports are exposed to the outside world. Every expansion of the system would have to be security vetted. This is expensive because it involves bringing in rare experts. The people you'd need can command 6 figure sums and you'd need many of them.

&gt; I don't personally like this argument, either... If people had that attitude in the past, we would be adversely affected now. Surely one must aim to eradicate a problem and its sources, not just control it?

There are real problems to deal with. Child abuse is low down the list because by the standards of the past it is very low and nobody can produce a system that would have a reasonable impact at a realistic price. The current solution isn't realistic because 95% of abuse happens within the family and this mass expense does nothing to deal with this general case. It is security theatre, designed only to win votes.

We wouldn't have a problem with rampant crime today because I do not say don't deal with crime. It merely establishes that there is a cost/benefit argument to be made with regards to crime. In the past it was relatively cheap to reduce crime as the low hanging fruit was still available. As costs go further up we naturally move to look at areas that are cheaper. Crime is eventually about economics. We solve it because it harms the economy and that damages society. However at some point it gets more costly than the crime it prevents. In this case that is certainly true.

By equivalent I mean that the total cost of setting up and running nuclear power from scratch is less than what Iran would make by selling the equivalent energy as oil. Right now they burn oil. They rightly see this as a waste of money when they could sell the oil and run nuclear. Per joule of energy nuclear is cheaper than oil for Iran.

Yes nuclear power plant disasters aren't that much of a problem. I just don't see the latter as likely. Even if Iran did get a bomb.

Six years ago, Robert Clive Whatley was [found guilty of using a motor vehicle without insurance and no MoT, using insulting words and behaviour and failing to give his name and address to a constable when asked](http://archive.southwalesargus.co.uk/2004/7/30/58738.html).

However, the pensioner appealed against his convictions, and the appeal was not contested, because the main prosecution witness, the arresting PC Ellis, had earlier [pleaded guilty to stealing £80 from a purse handed to him while he was on duty](http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/archive/2004/09/30/Gwent+Archive/4601150.Pensioner_set_to_sue_police/).

Seems he sued the police and won, then used his 'winnings' to buy a new (illegal) numberplate (E3RAS - apparently a reference to 'harass'?), which is one of the things that came up in the court case.

Also, in this latest case, he is accused of driving off before the ticket was issued, knocking a police officer while doing so, and refusing to stop for *17 miles* while police followed him with sirens and lights on because 'he thought they were giving him a police escort home'.

I would say that, going by the above (if all true), although I agree the officers were overly aggressive in thier tactics, this 'innocent pensioner' is far from innocent in this.",0,1281128193,null,0,false,0,c0w5q48,t3_cy5o2,t1_c0w5q48,t3_cy5o2,null,1426411638,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

2 strikers does still work in Europe. They haven't changed the rules to drastically alter the game. Even teams like Inter (who aren't very good, they probably won't even win anything) played with two strikers, just pushing one a bit wider. It's just the current trend because a bunch of teams in the WC played 'one up front', and England didn't and then lost.  


The only reason we'd change how we play is because we're likely to come up against a better class of opposition in the CL. Making wholesale changes to the way we play is going to some how turn us instantly into CL challengers? All we need to do is make the group stages and then concentrate on the league.


You should probably tell Daniel Levy that we could sign those players for £20m. They'd probably work for free as well!


If we someone manage to attract a 'top' striker for a reasonable amount, and on decent wages, GREAT.

Indeed.   For the most part people understand the severity of introducing a gun into a situation and won't make that leap.   Knives do not carry the same weight or significance to many people and are much more likely to be used to ""settle an argument"" than a gun. 

&gt;A gun can kill more people more easily than a knife.

Indeed.  When you've got the luxury of choosing your victim, as criminals do, a knife will work quite well, though.   The main advantage in the ease-of-use of guns vs. knives (or fists) comes from people who would be otherwise incapable of defending themselves.

&gt;And escalation will mean you won't be alone in haviing your gun to defend yourself anyway.

Laws acknowledge that _some_ can't be trusted to run free, and provide a justification to separate and restrict those who have proven their inability to run free.   

Restricting someone's rights _before_ they commit a crime is a travesty.

&gt;But once your have fair laws (or more properly got rid of all the egregiously unfair ones) there should be no need for vigilantism.

Whence vigilantism?   That has been no part of our discussion.

&gt;If you need a gun it's because you don't trust your society

Objectively, it's unlikely I _need_ a gun.   It's not unrealistic to hope I can go to my grave without ever having cause to put a hole in anything more threatening than a paper target.   But if I _do_ need a gun, hope isn't going to protect me or anyone else.

&gt;and rightly you shouldn't if you can get easily get one. Catch-22.

true,stormgirl,null,null,"If used efficiently &amp; correctly this could cut costs as well as help support children and their families. By being able to communicate with other professionals effectively and in a timely manner, it can be more about taking preventative action and having a support network in place before a situation gets out of hand. 

As a professional that works with children &amp; families it can be frustrating trying to access who else is involved with the family, what their role is &amp; what information they have. Especially if you only have information from the parent. 

When you are involved in making life changing decisions that impact on people's daily lives it is important to have all the information. For example, when we have a child attend our centre and we are concerned about their attendance/diet/appearance etc... It would be helpful to know that other professionals share the same concerns, so we can decide what needs to be done to improve the situation (if the parents prove they are unable to change it themselves obviously)

As someone on the frontline, this unfortunately is more common than you would think. Even the seemingly 'low level' stuff, like only feeding a child processed cheap foods (Mcds, nuggets &amp; soft drinks) has an impact when you think of the child's physical development, concentration levels at school (and therefore achievement) health etc... So the idea being that support can be put in place before the situation escalates to a major issue.

I just think when the government owns the majority of shares in a bank, it should have the right to intervene in how that bank is run.

The government brought shares that did not allow voting rights.  The idea of the government running a bank is too much for most people (aside from Northern Rock).

Not true.  There is income disparity for all jobs.  One street cleaner will earn more than another.  One city quant will earn more than the person he sits next to.  It often comes down to how desperate they were to hire someone and how much money they had to hire someone - salaries are then elastic so rarely correct themselves.  

Investment banks make a lot of money per employee meaning they can pay people a lot more at a whim.  Even their cleaners will earn more.  

It makes economic sense to pay the market rate, which changes through time.  If you put an advert up for cleaning staff and no one responds then you raise the hourly rate until you find someone.

This is the problem I have with the 'voluntarism' - you basically let a small group of people take all the resources by force (within or outside of the law) over the centuries, and then turn around and say that it is unfair to tax them, since they 'own' all these resources.

Did God himself give these people that land? Of course not. I'm sure if it were financially viable they'd have partitioned and bottled the air, and you'd be defending them whilst you pay for your monthly air allowance. The situation is just absurd, the Earth's resources are common to us all.

I take a pragmatic approach. We should try and minimize human suffering, and I think that this is best done by establishing a true meritocracy with equal opportunities, not an aristocracy supported merely by the law of men. What gives them any more right to partiton the land than you or I?

true,Orbixx,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"No, because I can find cases of that myself, particularly those found in America (but one could argue that America is significantly larger than the UK, thus more incidents are likely to occur).

What I am saying is that there is no logical reason for an officer to tase somebody who didn't deserve it, unless they are being irrational, which is sadly a human flaw which cannot be constantly avoided. There will be many officers who utilise a taser professionally, but there will also be somebody who either accidentally or purposefully misuses a taser.

This however is not something that is limited to the police. The police are only as good as humanity lets it be. The police as an organisational unit should not come under such heavy criticism unless they are simply letting in idiots and allowing them to wield tasers - their training is stringent. A person who is clever enough can pass any test necessary in order for him to acquire a taser and then use it how he sees fit, even if that means immorally; an immoral person can also pretend to be completely moral and competent to the proper use of a taser.

In summary, what I am trying to say is that events of misuse of tasers are unavoidable, but can be minimised and that it is unproductive to continually criticise the use of tasers when it is not tasers that are the problem, it is us, humanity. It is however better to have tasers than not as they solve more problems than they create.",0,1281319897,null,0,false,0,c0wb20e,t3_cxtdc,t1_c0wb20e,t1_c0wal04,null,1426414150,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

3. Victory of the Daleks-The only winner here was that this script was filmed.

4. Time of Angels &amp; Flesh and Stone-What a great way to ruin two great concepts at the same time!

5. Vampires of Venice-I was still comparing Smith to Tennant at this point and found Smith wanting.

6. Amy's Choice-Good episode, not great but I started warming up to Smith at this point.

7. The Hungry Earth &amp; Cold Blood-Then these two aired. Awful. Awful. Awful.

8. Vincent and the Doctor-Great episode, the series is almost over and it's finally picking up some momentum. I loved the ending to death.

9. The Lodger-It's **finally** starting to get consistently good!

10. The Pandorica Opens-Fucking great! Oh man, I cannot wait until next week! I *need* to know how The Doctor is going to wrap this one up!

11. The Big Bang-I fucking hate you Moffet. I fucking hate you. This should have been titled the Big Whimper. What was the point of the villains being in the previous episode if they didn't even figure into the next?

Troughton isn't my absolute favorite, but I think he exemplifies this dynamic, and the strength of his performance is a major part of what has made it so quintessentially Doctor-ish.

The Eleventh Hour- One of the best Who episodes ever with a crowning moment of badass at the end.

The Beast Below- A well-rounded episode that showcased an amazing scene and mind twist at the end. 

Victory of the Daleks-The only dud of the season, played it too fast and loose with this one.

Time of Angels &amp; Flesh and Stone- One of the best two-parters of Who, Father Octavian's death scene, the reveal of the angels, Amy coming onto the Doctor at the end. Very re-watchable.

Vampires of Venice- Great opening scene, great dialog from the Doctor's Vampire freak out to his and Rory's ""Yours is bigger then mine"" ""Lets not go there"". Watching Matt turn down the Sister of the Water is still one of the best showcases of how he can be warm, kind and terrifying at the same time.

Incidentally, there's a sharp rise in the damage a car does to a person once the speed goes much above 20 mph.  The reason is simple: our bodies have evolved to survive the kind of damage that happens when you're running at full speed down a hill (say, 15-20mph), trip up and and slam into the hard ground.  If they hadn't then we wouldn't be here.

However, we haven't evolved to survive impacts at higher speeds.  So the vast majority of pedestrians hit by cars at 20mph suffer no long term damage.  But at 30 mph or more you're much more likely to be killed or seriously injured.

Hypocrisy aside, I drive at 20-25mph around schools and pedestrianised areas and I don't give a shit about the angry people who tailgate me, fuming at the fact that I'm not driving at *exactly* the speed limit, or slightly above.  Fuck 'em.  Maybe one day it'll be your kid who steps out in front of my car.  How fast do you want me to be going then?

I agree with what deadAlias said.  80 or 90mph on a motorway is fine by me if the road is clear and the conditions are good.  But if it's pissing with rain, foggy, or packed with traffic, then I'm happier doing a steady 50 or 60 down the inside lane.

* The motorway speed limit was a [temporary limit introducted in 1965](http://www.theaa.com/public_affairs/reports/history-of-motorways.html).

* Speed limits are not necessarily based on safety. For example, what may be safe on dry surfaces is not necessarily the same in the wet, or with poor tires etc. This has grown over the years into a kind of policy where local governments set speed limits to arbitrary values without consideration to what is actually safe, and more based on what they're told (e.g. kill your speed not a child).

* The person that knows your car's capabilities and limits best is you.

There is no hypocrisy. Motorists are an easy target, as are the middle class.

The **6:30pm Radio 4 Friday slot** is R4s official topical slot and has a rotating schedule of 6~8 episodes of The News Quiz &amp; The Now Show (with occasional other shows of a similar kind sometimes). News Quiz is the original HIGNFY and Now Show is a bit more 'sketchy', both worth checking out though. (Both are podcast together from BBC too, which is handy)

There's also **the Bugle podcast** which is a weekly chat between Andy Zaltzman and John Oliver which is both very funny, and 'never ending' which is great! (Except for right now when they're on 'Edinburgh Fringe break' :( )

Zaltzman also crops up in **Chris Addison's Seven Day Sunday** Show (Five Live 11am Sunday (also podcast). That show is also on a break right now, but  they did about 13 hour long weekly shows before that, so I'm assuming they'll be back weekly for a while.

There's also topical sketch show **Newsjack** on BBC7 which recently finished a 6 week run, but it's the second series so far this year so they could well be back before too long (They also are podcast.)

Other then TV stuff, that's pretty much it. **Private Eye** is definitely worth getting, if you like the more 'serious' Daily Show stuff (The ""How hypocritical/unbelievable is this"" serious reporting side).

I am not claiming to have been born in, raised in, or even ever been in Wales (although I may have flown over it a couple times).  I think that my post makes that quite clear.  I'm not sure why you felt the need to get an attitude about my choice of words.  If I am not mistaken Welsh refers to both people who are from Wales and an ethnic group.  Following the latter definition, I would be Welsh no different than a Serb living in Croatia would be a Serb (although only partially ethnically Welsh).  This might be an American way of looking at ethnicity and if it is offensive to you as a pure Welshman then I apologize.  You will often hear people in the United States say things like ""I am Italian"" or ""Irish"" or even ""Irish, Italian, and German"", and they're not trying to make you think they're from another country.  They are merely describing their ethnic background.

Second:  You're making a big assumption about my knowledge of foreign cultures here, but that's a different point.  Following the spirit of my post, I think it's fairly easy to figure out that I am not actually Irish or Mexican or any nationality other than American.  I do have a knowledge of the culture of those countries and ethnic groups, though.  As far as Welsh culture I knew so much less information that I wanted to learn a bit about what makes Wales a country and not just a part of England.  

Third:  I FUCKING LOVE NASCAR!  Just kidding.  But that is a good example of ""American culture"".  If you wanted to define American culture versus another similar country such as Canada, then NASCAR might be a good example.  If a lot of Welsh liked to sit around on Sunday and watch cars drive in a circle for a couple hours while most English would rather watch guys push rocks on sheets of ice, then that would certainly tell us something about the Welsh (probably related to the ""lots of drinking"" you mentioned).

I'm curious about you being a Welsh speaker.  Did you grow up speaking Welsh or did you learn it later?  Do you mostly speak it with family?  By default do you just speak English when out and about?  Is there anyone who speaks Welsh but not English?

true,thecitizens911,null,null,"I don't know if it's obnoxious on my part or rather that I just hate the way he looks. The ""quizzical"" looks he gets or the silly attempt at seeming alien, which alludes to what maidenfan was talking about, just make me dislike looking at him and seeing his face everywhere. Sure it's not fair to dislike him for what he looks like, but it is fair to dislike the casting director for having chosen him in the first place in an attempt to trade up from Tennant, who is by the way gorgeous. However, I will recant my 6am rant about his un-evolved looks, if that helps, and will attempt to explain exactly why I can't stand to look at him and call him Doctor.
 
The Doctor has, over the years, been built up as a Herculean type who has battled all measure of demons, including THE demon that started it all, including the mythos. Over the past 5 decades the Doctor has become more attractive as he's gotten younger, starting out with the 60+ year old Grandfather/Doctor until reaching the young Matt Smith. However, with the exception of what people thought was attractive in the 70s, he has always had some sexual appeal.
 
The first incarnation, William Hartnell, fell into the personality of being the grandpa, which he was often called IIRC in the first series. This not being sexy at all there is at least some attraction to him as he is a nice old man with many galactic secrets and you could warm up to him if you were a child, which the show was aimed toward. This made him fun and mysterious.
 
The second incarnation, although not attractive physically, or emotionally, was nothing to remember, since I dont remember seeing many episodes of his anyway. However, from looking at him and stills from old episodes I can infer that he would at least be somewhat smelly from all of the travelling and exploring. Moving on...
 
Jon Pertwee, as the third incarnation was really gruff. Just looking at the way he dressed you could tell he was high up on himself and definitely acted as such around humans. He hated being there working with/for the humans and tried to find as many ways to leave as possible. This leads to the fourth incarnation.
 
Tom Baker was cute. Not physically, but his attitude and personality were very attractive. You wanted to explore the universe with him. He was a wanderer and has very similar traits to Eccleston's interpretation. He is by far the most alien in his strangeness and mood swings (alien doesn't have to mean silly or antipodal to human behavior, the Doctor's been around for 900+ years, I'm pretty sure you'd get the hang of human behavior by that point). 
 
I cannot speak to the fifth, sixth or seventh Doctors since they never aired here where I live, however reading their profiles or seeing small snippets on youtube I can conclude that they became more sullen and/or angry, more controlling, until McCoy who acted a much more tired alien role. This Doctor showed the ravishes of age much more than previous older Doctors through his preferred method of travel within the Tardis (ie old Victorian furniture and record-player, ancient books, etc... he had a lot of antiques is what I'm driving at), which personifies his antiquated lifestyle. He was an interesting character.
 
Skip to the eighth Doctor, who to my knowledge had a short run, I only saw the movie that ran in the US, if he did anything else I know nothing of it. But from what I remember he was my favorite at the time. He was younger, yet still held on to features of antiquity: ""I was with Puccini when he died..."" and now we've got more nerd this time as opposed to the Victorian knight. He's young, he's sexy, he's got long wavy hair, he's not boisterous, not alien, he's half-human... on his mother's side. This Doctor tried very hard and succeeded in making us like him in only ~2 hours. Dressing as an early 19th century gentleman he portrayed a kind and forgiving Doctor with a tragic future (ie time war and death of the Time Lords). Also, this incarnation also answers (to my knowledge of course) why he's called Doctor Who, since he gets amnesia on Earth. 
 
Anyway, moving on to Eccleston we finally get an energetic and happy yet mysterious Doctor with secrets that you can only corner him into telling you. His 180 mood swings from brooding to ecstatic made us love him for the hurt boy inside. He was in deep pain with regrets like no other. Having ""killed"" (we thought he killed his people at that time, not frozen them in time) his civilization in stopping the Time War we could see the pain oozing from his soul as he tried to save the human race from its mistakes and the same disease that took over his own people. The kindness and love for humanity and ALL life was so strong that not even the Bad Wolf could take symbiotic control to destroy the enemies around him. To him there was always another solution to death and destruction: ""... coward, any day..."", even his own death he saw as a better alternative to killing everything. ""Everything has it's time and everything dies.""
 
Eccleston's death was painful to watch. You didn't want this tragic hero to go. You felt for him, you rooted for him regardless of him being the Doctor, and you never wanted his adventures to end. But then came Tennant. He brought the best of Eccleston with him, the love of humanity, the responsibility of care that he took for them and the mission he took upon himself to see just how far they would go. Dont forget him hugging the captain of the research vessel on the Impossible Planet, or his selfless attempts at saving companions or not even when outnumbered. This was the hero that Eccleston could never be. This incarnation had cojones. He fought the Daleks (several times), the Cybermen, the Devil, robot repairmen, cats, werewolves, bat things, a young girl's imagination, ghosts, sun monsters, a crazy hick family, a tv monster, more robots and Cybermen, the Master several times, the Ood, the Ood's captors, wasps, forest bugs, the Angels, etc etc etc. And none of them scared him. Sure they pissed him off when they killed someone he cared about but he always gave them a choice. Now, physically speaking he was sexy and he knew it. He attracted every single companion he was with and all the ones that wanted to be with him. Piss on everyone else, his death made me cry. He became my fictional hero and still is.
 
That brings me to Matt Smith. I will not even pirate his episodes. So let's go into his personality. It's flat. Even with his attempts at being alien, at acting strange, at dressing funny, or for whatever reason people think is cool - wearing a bow tie, etc, he does not care about the human race. He doesn't fight off aliens on or in the Earth to save/protect humanity but instead does it for the sake of his perverted curiosity (that annoying rip in spacetime). He's not funny (at all, falling down, banging into things, making silly faces are not signs of comic genius, they're derivative of Jim Carrey circa 1995). He has no care for his companions emotions nor is he wise for his age. It seems that all the work done learning about humans and the universe, all the travelling and exploring done, all the pain accumulated from so many dead, so many lost, so many he could have saved, he cares only for himself. That's not my Doctor. My Doctor was over 900 years old and no matter what carried his mistakes with him always trying to better himself.
 
Now, about the stories. First of all I had HIGH hopes for the return of the angels. It's introduction was stale and uninteresting, even the whole concept of the angels being written into your mind's eye or in a drawing was complete hokum. Sure it was a bit tense when Amy was stuck in the pod but it completely rewrote Dr Who canon in terms of the angels. The faceless statues were a good twist but that was really all that was good about it. However, even that part was completely obliterated by the choice of director showing the angels moving on screen with bad cgi. It pains me to dislike the writer of this episode but making that choice completely disconnected the Doctor-viewer relationship. We saw what he saw, we felt what he felt, we experience what he experienced, but this basically told us to forget being his primary companion throughout the series and become just another ancillary character, someone in the shadows. It made us the aliens. And regardless of how quirky he behaves and tries to win us over we'll still be in that position. Think what you like of this point but it was pretty clear to me when I saw it, and I am a huge Doctor Who fan going back 2 decades, so it pains me to hate the new incarnation. The 11th incarnation is not funny, charming, physically attractive, nerdy, dark, emotional, or any such adjective.
 
As an aside, none of the incarnations I can remember ever disrespected the Tardis, which saved his ass on so many occasions, but Matt Smith (either by having it written in or ad-libbing it himself, in any case fuck you Matt Smith) made me hate him for spitting on the Tardis. Sorry, 900+ years old and spitting on your friend and mode of transportation is not cool.
 
But again, this is just my opinion. Think what you like and make your own decisions on the subject. However, I just dont like Smith. He has no redeeming qualities and even if the episode was well written I found his presence to be unsettling and even longing for any incarnation than this one.

Also... as someone who was on the dole a few years ago after losing both my parents and going into a depressive free-fall they're going to uncover a lot of shit here because it's actually impossible to survive on £60/week when you factor in your bills etc. without doing a little 'extra curricular' activity on the side. Basically unless you live with your parents it just can't be done. 

Case in question: My friend Bibi who was sacked from her advertising job when they found out she was pregnant ( it went to tribunal but their lawyers were better than hers, turned it around to make her look incompetent and she lost actually owing *them* money in lawyers fees ) That's advertising for you though. 

OK so now she has a kid ( the father fucked off to Australia ) is signing on, looking for a job in an industry where at the moment there aren't any and is completely broke so she does the odd 'under the table' work to pay the bills, I also give her money for the kid. A credit agency would look at her bills, look at the money the government is giving her and immediately raise the question: How is she actually paying those bills? Next thing she'll be investigated and her benefits will be frozen so she'll basically be up shit creek without a boat... never mind a paddle. 

I've spoken to her this morning and she's absolutely terrified that this is going to happen. Now I can imagine that this scenario is being mirrored up and down the country at present, there are a lot of people on the dole right now trying to survive after the last couple of years, there will be a lot more joining them over the next couple of years after all of these 'cuts' kick in. 

Which leads me to the question: Is trying to keep your head above water an act of fraud? Surely this system could be updated to accommodate these people instead of investigating them with a ruthless performance based credit agency.  

Now I'm not saying that there aren't genuine dole cheats out there, of course there are, but seriously going after people who get £60/week when the banking industry has just got away with absolute murder. That's just fucked up.

I think Torchwood is the type of show that works well having one story arc over a several episode span. I also liked how in CoE it didn't have a happy ending. Everything didn't magically just come together at the end. I think that says a lot for RTD writing style. I can imagine seeing a similar course of events in the new series, RTD has shown that all ending do not need to be happy ones. 

Only thing I am not sure about right now is the CIA agents. I have faith in RTD to make the characters work. I am worried the CIA will try to pull a similar even as in CoE and kidnap/try to kill Jack because he is a threat. Or take him for tests because he cant die, etc.. The way it sounds now, that won't happen but who knows what the future will bring.

I see Scotland and England in many ways like England and Germany in football, England have a massive rivalry with Germany and think they're better, but really Germany know they're better and have long moved on from giving a shit. 

What really brought it home was when it was the election and the BBC were interviewing people in Scotland who were annoyed that DC was going to be PM.

River's timeline is going to go like this:

* There's an adventure archaeologistwho longs to unlock the secrets of the legendary Time Lords. She lives far enough into the future that Time Travel is possible for humans, if risky. (See Talons of Weng-Chiang)

* She finds the journal of the adventures of a certain River Song with The Doctor, including the story of how they first met. 

* She goes to that location, dispenses with the ""Original River"" and follows the lines in her journal when the Doctor turns up. 

* The Doctor's already met her many times and implicitly trusts her which initially confuses River the Con artist.

* River uses her influence with The Doctor to change history, in the process killing the mysterious ""Best man she ever knew"" (fingers crossed that it's not Rory, although it would be hella sweet if Rory was Best man at a River-Doctor wedding)

* The Doctor's faith in her is shattered, and he vows to never travel with her again.

* River goes to Stormcage.

* Wracked with guilt River continues to meet up with The Doctor in his past to try and atone.

* Future Doctor makes an exception to his vow, meets River, gives her his modified Sonic.

* Silence of the Library/ Forest of the Dead.
