    Aberdeen Asset Management plc: Monthly ongoing payment of £4,166.67 gross

    Continental Farmers Group plc: Monthly ongoing payment of £3,750 gross

    Adam Smith International: Monthly ongoing payment of £2,916.66 gross.

    Unilever plc: Monthly ongoing payment of £2,719 gross plus 4,167 euros gross

On face value it does sound like a decent idea. Currently the low-end jobs are barely worth going for as they pay not much more than you get on benefits. This does not mean benefits give you plenty of money but that shitty wages are simply a disincentive to working those jobs.

In my house a minimum wage job pays little better than benefits since the council tax and rent take such huge chunks out of the paycheck. Those two bills alone account for half. Add on top utilities and then that's another 25% gone with the remainder spent on food and other essentials.

Also, if you fly into Belfast City or International a bus is about a tenner to Dublin, the bus from Dublin Airport to the city centre is like €7 so think about that if the flights are cheaper. A train is about a tenner if you book online too. Translink has the timetables for Belfast to elsewhere on its website. Bus Eireann runs a bus to the city centre from Dublin Airport, but I think Aircoach does too. The Dublin Airport site will have a list of operators on its site.

true,MissDM,tardis,TARDIS,"I agree Blink is a great episode, but it hardly has the Doctor in it. To introduce people to Doctor Who you have to cater to the audience with that first episode - do they enjoy more mystery and scary type episodes, serious deep episodes, or would they rather watch something funny? 

If they like the mystery/scary I would advise watching The Time of Angels. However, that is a two parter. Episode one of series five would be good because it is meant for catching first time viewers while keeping the old. Moffat made sure to make that one exceptionally good. 

If they like serious/deep than Family of Blood (two parter) or the Girl in the Fireplace (1 ep) or Vincent and the Doctor (1 ep) are all very good.

If they want light hearted/funny I would suggest half of the episodes in series 1 or 4, but off the top of my head I would say Partners in Crime or The Unicorn and the Wasp.  Hope that helps.

true,monkeypickle,mcgann,McGann,"For the sake of this discussion, let me use the following analogy (my apologies to any biology specifics I trample over):

Your physical being a composite piece of hardware made up of independent components (bacteria, cells, proteins, etc.) selfishly working towards a common goal (continued existence and the replication of DNA).  Your brain acts much like a processor, while your mind (your memories, your consciousness) is the operating system.   In this particular case, your mind is stored on a solid state device (the electromagnetic field generated by your brain) and while you control many of the overt actions of your body, the real work is done by your component parts (bacteria, organs, etc) all coordinated by your brain.  

When you die your brain is no longer capable of generating that electromagnetic field, thus that solid state drive is simply gone while the component parts go about their business as long as they are able.  Your ego, your memories, your sense of self are simply dissipated energy that is unable to maintain itself without the processor and drive. It's an unrecoverable error, that's for sure. 

*This* is what makes death scary for people: The idea that our ego, our personality, our very us-ness (so to speak) is simply gone like data on a crashed and destroyed drive.  This is exactly why people gravitate towards believing in an afterlife where not their body, but their personality and ego persist indefinitely.  

We don't believe our operating system is quietly chugging along when we power off the PC, but we'd like to believe that about ourselves.  The physical nature of our existence simply does not allow for it.  We are not immune to natural law. 

There is no ""something else"" out there coming to claim our drive-less, processor-less operating systems either for punishment or reward.  As the fellow(a?) above states, there isn't even any darkness because your mind no longer exists to process one.  

And yes, oddly enough this is rather comforting to me.

The burka and veil are an answer to a moral question, which is ""how do we deal with the *problem* of female sexuality and how men might be instinctively inclined to respond to this?"". I really don't think hiding women is the correct answer, and it isn't the answer in most cultures.

The burka and veil have only really become as popular as they are over the last fifty years, they are not an intrinsic part of Islam. The highly influential Islamic philosopher, Sayyid Qutb was wholly instrumental in its rise to popularity, his writings were highly influential on the laws of Talibani Afghanistan and especially Osama Bin Laden for example.

Here is a quote from Qutb.

""The American girl is well acquainted with her body's seductive capacity. She knows it lies in the face, and in expressive eyes, and thirsty lips. She knows seductiveness lies in the round breasts, the full buttocks, and in the shapely thighs, sleek legs — and she shows all this and does not hide it.""

Surely the universities are just another extension of the public-school system. 

If you could design a system where people had a fair chance of learning valuable skills they can use in their lives as well as gaining social skills and other general wisdoms, you could reduce the institutionalised privilege of the already privileged. 

Are you suggesting such a system is unfeasible?

Of course, rich people will always live in rich neighbourhoods and have rich people's value systems and hang out with other rich people but the bit where the state is involved can help minimise the inequality by making sure all schools offered the same gamut of opportunities so that when you live in the shitty part of town, you still get the best possible schooling.

I think ""education"" should be a lot broader than it is now. Book learning is good for some but useless for others. The entire value system of our society is fucked up so that everyone is chasing grades and high-status careers. People have learned how to regurgitate information. 

The concept that the bozos in ""power"" have about education is bullshit. I think they are happy to allow the education system to create a society of ignorami who are fixated on achieving material comfort. 

I think by eliminating public schools you might motivate the powerful to improve the school system so their precious little terrors will learn more than how do disembowl each other and smoke Skunk. 

&gt;Um.. could you define what you mean by ""anarchist"" for me? Sounds like youre arguing for a system in which the government has an awful lot more control over people's lives and choices than they have right now.

Anarchist means having no government. This is not going to happen. I ideologically would like to see a society in which people learn how to get on with each other and control their own lives and live in cooperative communities without money and without rigid power structures. I think capitalism is a disease and most of us are just fodder for the wealth creation needs of the tiny elite. 

Until such a thing becomes feasible to make real (I think it might happen when people change their minds about what's important or off the back of a catastrophic social collapse), I would like government to limit the power of the elites and do their best endeavours to facilitate reasonable equality. 

I think the school system should be a great deal freer. There should be a system which allows kids to find the stuff they are good at and like and allow them to get in to it. After reading and math, everything should be free and open, creativity should be encouraged and the benefits of grades and being a lawyer put in to perspective. And other hippy shit. 

I think this is just is all just ideas. The country is run by cunts and they are going to destroy society before doing something fair and reasonable.

You wouldn't.

So, until we have this awesome social change in which everyone abandons all hierarchical power structures and learns to love each other we should have the government exert greater power over people to tell them what they can and can't do?

Reminds me of that Banksy line; ""We can't do anything to change the world until capitalism crumbles. Until then lets all go shopping to console ourselves"". 

I totally accept that when the oil runs dry and East Anglia is completely underwater and we're all stabbing each other with plastic forks for the last tin of baked beans that it might be a good idea to try and rebuild the new world in a drastically different way from the old one, but having a hardcore authoritarian government in the mean time that doesn't allow you to educate your children the way you want them to be isn't going to help.

It sounds like you're arguing for the total opposite of what your ideology wants.

Because currently people have the the right to send their children to Eton (and other such schools) if they have the money to send them there, and the kid is considered bright enough to get in. You're proposing removing that choice from people, and forcing them to send them to a school controlled and funded by the government. You're proposing taking away that freedom that people currently have, and forcing them to be educated the way the government says they should be educated. That's authoritarian in my book. 

&gt;The public school system is institutionalised corruption. 

No, the ""old boy network"" is institutionalised corruption. There's a difference. That's a totally separate issue from whether or not people should be allowed to send their children to private school in the first place. 

&gt;Why is it the opposite of what I think would be best to make all schools equal in resources and strive for a fairer system by outlawing an elitist system?

This comes down to the difference between freedom and fairness. You can't have a society in which everyone is equal and has the same opportunities without a shitload of goverment control enforcing said fairness, shitting all over your lovely freedom. This is why I think your desire for anarchy (freedom from control) is incompatible with your desire for fairness (which requires lots of control to maintain). 

Just out of interest, where do you stand on selective state funded schools?

This isn't Saudi Arabia (thank Yahweh) but I do think that a decent fraction of the women wearing veils are doing so because their husband's/father's word is law. On this point it's impossible to know what the truth is.

If I had my way, everyone would dress like they were auditioning for Mad Men, they'd speak seven languages and know The Elements by heart, but thankfully I don't have my way so everyone is saved from the labours of Pantagruel.

""Will people like you..."" is the start of an ad hominem attack if ever I read one; I shall answer this charge below, however.

Entering any religious building is on the grounds of the people whose religion it is. If the requirements were to be tarred and feathered, or egged and floured, so be it. The argument is of veils in public places, I wouldn't count a mosque as a public place (I may be mistaken from a legal perspective).

""This entire debate is nothing more than thinly veiled racism, used to sell our wars to the public."" Even if the first point (before the comma) is true, getting to the second claim from it is quite a leap, though I'm somewhat inclined to believe it. On the first point, there's no doubt that some people will have this argument because of racist tendencies, but I don't believe that that's the case for everyone. The reason lokithecomplex convinced me that a ban is out of order is because they convinced me my motives were not pure. Like as I may the argument that women are unfairly being subjugated by men I think that the root of my unease is the hiding of the face. This is why I don't have a problem with nun's habits. I think that in the U.K. we care about the equal treatment of others, and either by hiding your face or jumping a queue you are treating others unfairly, partly because people falsely believe that by watching someone's face you can spot a liar ([interesting reading](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3743448.stm)). If I were to ban wearing a veil I'd have to be for a ban of talking to someone whilst you have earphones plugged in (come to think of it, I am).

""No one was talking about this stuff prior to our recent wars."" I can't really say anything on this, I was 19 when Iraq was invaded for the second time and didn't pay much attention.

Great scenes at the end with the players and the fans! Hopefully it's on the highlights.

Series 1

Children in Need Special (short 7 minute episode)

The Christmas Invasion

Series 2

The Runaway Bride

Series 3

Time Crash (another short episode)

Voyage of the Damned

Series 4

The Next Doctor

One of the main problems I have with comic adaptations is that the writers have free reign to make the story as epic as possible, as they are not constrained by budget.   Unfortunately, they generally go gung ho with this and the story is so massively epic that it no longer feels like a Doctor Who episode. 

However, the Comics in Doctor Who Magazine are rather amazing.  Much better characterization, great art for most of them and some fantastic story arcs.   Panini collects them in TPB form.  My comic store had a few a while back.  I'm sure you can order them online.

So the education system reflects the job market it provides workers for? Sounds like you need to change the latter before the former.

&gt; It's a fucking ridiculous idea, not just for the ethical reasons but because it breaks the law and guidance.

Agreed.  But my feeling is that all CCTVs in public places should have a live internet feed that *any* citizen can look at.

This is based on the fact that any person could travel to that place and spend all day watching/filming what's going on.  A CCTV is an extension of that right, BUT it must be openly accessible to all.

The problem with CCTV as it currently stands (and the scheme described in the article) is that we're all being spied on and only a few select people have the right to do the spying.  At the very least, we should all have the right to be the watchers as well as the watched.

Better still, get rid of CCTVs altogether.  It's little more than an elaborate scheme by the security/defence industry to transfer tax-payers money into their own accounts.

There is a real funding crisis in the university sector at the moment. This is about to get worse, possibly very much worse. 

The elephant in the room that has been plugging some of that gap is the large influx of overseas students. For many universities they are are *the* cash cow. The international trade in students has become huge business, so much so that our one real advantage (speaking English) is being wittled away by other first world universities that are now offering full courses in English to attract some of this business away from the UK and US. In addition to this, many universities in the countries that traditionally send large numbers of overseas students (China and India mostly, but also several middle east countries) are quickly working their way up the international rankings. So much so that there is increasingly less and less advantage to studying abroad than at home for many. Depending on the sector, coming here may already be a disadvantage.

The obvious temptation is to increase fees for overseas students. If you're from say India and from a moderately well off family then the fees for your education already constitute the entirity of your family's wealth and a good proportion of your projected future earnings. If you can get an equally good education at home without mortgaging the lives of several generations of your family to do it then the choice is obvious. 

The market dictates the money isn't going to come from overseas students, so if it's not going to come from domestic students either where will it come from?

No, not at all.  But in principle, there's nothing to stop someone from stalking me IRL, assuming that I'm walking around in a public place.  There should be (and are) laws against stalking, but we shouldn't restrict people's access to public places just because they could be misused.  Similarly, if (big IF) we are going to have CCTVs then they should be treated as ""remote monitoring of a public place"".  Anyone who has the right to visit that public place should, by extension, have the right to view the CCTV feed.

To clarify, I'm not supporting CCTVs at all.  Just saying that if we have to have them (and in some cases, their use may be justified), then they should be open access for everyone to view.

true,Mendota,tardis,TARDIS,"I went on a trip to the UK with my parents last summer, and did 2 days in London, 3 days in Cardiff, then two more in London again. I really enjoyed the trip, so I'll outline what we did and what I might change about it.


Fly into London and take a train to Cardiff, no car needed. Not only was not having a car easier and cheaper, it won't be terribly necessary. If you've got young kids who might not hold up to walking long distances, it might be wise to hire one anyways, but driving in the UK is not cheap and can be a large hassle. I personally love the London Underground, so I recommend using it as much as possible. There will be weekend closures though, so be aware that your travel may be complicated on the weekends.

Trains to Cardiff leave several times a day (from Paddignton if memory serves) and the trip is a lovely 3 hr  journey. You'll pass through Bath, Bristol, and towns of all sizes. I thoroughly enjoyed the train trip.

As for what to do:

In London, I'd recommend the British Museum, as its free and full of artifacts from all over, most notably the Rosetta Stone. The Tower of London is rather touristy, and isn't free, but I recommend it anyways. Very cool site of British history.

In Cardiff, you HAVE to go Cardiff Bay. It's featured prominently in DW and Torchwood shots, and is a lovely area to walk around in. It's fun picking out what is seen in which episode as you walk around. ALso in Cardiff are two other ""must sees,"" Cardiff Castle and the Doctor Who Exhibition. The castle is a neat mini fortress in the middle of downtown, and has lots of cool rooms decorated by the past owners of the castle. Theres alos a large park attached through which is a small river. THe BW Exhibition is perhaps the best way to tour DW history. It's situated in a mall near the Millenium Centre on teh Bay, and it has both a large collection of DW props, costumes and exhibits and a massive souvenir shop to get whatever DW trinkets you could ever want!

We now know that the kits take around 1 week to order &amp; recieve and
we are selling them at £28 each. 
However, until we recieved our first order, we were unaware that this did not include sponsorship printing (New College in the middle). 
So if you wish to have the sponsorship printing too, it will cost an extra £3.50 per shirt. However you can have the plain kit with just the Redditch United crest if you wish.
So as follows:
Redditch United Home/or Away kit plain (no sponsor) - £28
Redditch United Home/or Away kit with 'New College' sponsor - £31.50 (awaiting a text back to confirm this)
If you are interested in a shirt, please send me a message on here or e-mail me at abates86@hotmail.com. Please include size, long/short sleeved, sponsor/no sponsor, home/or away.
I'll also try and get some pics of the rest of the merchandise (mugs,pens, badges,car stickers, tax disc holders etc.) so you can all see what's available, and if there's enough interest I'll list some of that on eBay too.

The problem we have is that the cost isn't worth it now at over £3,000, and if the price is multiplied by five it's completely ludicrous. There's no way in hell that a CS student would spend three years being taught a bastardised version of their subject and trained to become Java code monkeys for £15K a year, in the same way that no one would pay for a sub-standard history degree.

Not suggesting that it's a penalty. Getting people into work sooner and dissuading them from getting into vast amounts of debt is a pretty good thing, actually. A knowledge and understanding of history can't be properly quantified by letters after a name, likewise with philosophy. Engineering, medicine, sciences... are quite inaccessible to the amateur, on the other hand. I don't know of anywhere I can learn to perform a heart triple bypass apart from working in a hospital or in university. But there are masses of places chronicling the last 2000 years and beyond, and being able to compare and contrast sources of information to come up with a reasoned opinion and understanding is a basic life skill we do all the time.

(Sorry, this isn't all in order)

&gt;You also need all the arts graduates who go on to be the happy little worker bees in the public and private sector middle management.

If I was a cleaner, I would prefer to be told how to clean floors by someone who used to clean floors and got promoted to middle management, than by a University graduate who left university without ever swinging a mop and who does not possess the skills to explain how they want their floor cleaned. I feel that many of the graduates who go straight from university into a middle management job in something unrelated to their degree are doing a worse job than someone who worked up from the bottom of the company would do, because they don't actually understand what it's like to be at the bottom and the problems that management can cause.

&gt; By your reckoning, the leaders of all 3 major political parties and the chancellor did degress that do not benefit the 'average joe' (whoever the hell that is), yet they're all pretty essential to a 'functioning society'.

This carries on from my last point. How can we have people coming out of University, which is reasonably sheltered from the 'real world', and going straight into a role of leadership (as an MP, say). They are not from the same world as the people they are trying to lead, so they're inevitable doomed to be crap at their leadership. Really, Cameron, Clegg and Miliband... aren't the best people to cite as successes from the education system who should be vaunted as great leaders. Cameron comes from the old school, Imperial age of public schooling. As an ex-public-schoolboy myself, who recently started at a college... the society in that school is about 50 years behind reality. It's remarkably false, and the people there don't have the problems that the other 95% of Britons have. How can someone brought up in that system possibly understand what it's like for ornery Joe, when they've never met ir *been* ornery Joe in a real life situation? The only person I'd trust to run this 'berg is someone who basically dragged themselves up from the bottom and has seen life at its worst, so he knows what to fix. Not someone who was told ghost stories about stabbings in the inner city by their live-in nanny.

Ok, a new tack.

&gt;If you prioritise only science and engineering, you end up with too many scientists and engineers and not enough jobs for them...

No, we need to be honest about what needs a degree and what doesn't. Some things are best learned via apprenticeships, BTECs and NVQs, or on the job, while other things are best learned in a lecture hall. Society needs to stop thinking that everyone deserves or even *requires* a degree. Universities should be for where people are pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, and the rest of us will learn of it as it filters down. At one point, only 4 people understood general relativity. Now pretty much every man and his dog knows the basics of it. Now the bleeding edge is... M-theory, I think. I have no idea what it is, it's a bit of a mindfuck, but one day I might know some basics beyond 'membranes' or whatever it is.

What you seem to be saying is that you don't 'deserve' a university education if you're not a scientist/engineer. You have no right to tell people that, no more than I have to say you don't deserve one unless you're a historian. You're using the current state of the economy to justify a hugely far-reaching education policy that will have repurcussions for the next fifty or more years. The economy is *not* always going to be this bad. What are we going to do when things get better and we realise we've told a shed load of young people that it's not worth them aspiring to anything? They can't all become plumbers and hairdressers. I suspect a lot of them will end up on benefits, and then you'll be faced with another problem all together. 

You say that putting people off from going to university is not a penalty because it means they won't rack up lots of debt. I agree that not everyone should go to university - if you've got 3 Ds at A-level, it's obvious that you're not suited to academic work and that university would be a waste of time. However, if you've got 3 or 4 As and you want to study English Literature or History, then you should be able to go on the same basis as someone going to study science. We already have a situation where children from poor families are not encouraged to go to university; we should not discourage some of them more based on the fact that they prefer the arts. 

I'm going to skip the argument that graduates know nothing about the 'real world' because it's just tarring thousands of very varied people with a label that means nothing. If you feel that the current leaders of the country know nothing about your personal situation, then vote for some who do. If you think none of them do, then go into schools and encourage more poor children to aspire to become politicians. 

What it seems to boil down to, in the end, is 'I don't want my taxes spent on X, Y, or Z'. This is an argument entirely based on your personal circumstances and your feelings towards people who you think have made them worse. For example, I never want to have children, so why should my taxes be spent on the local school. I think we both know that these are not arguments on which to found a society; they are knee-jerk reactions to current events.

Lastly, I'd like to clear up some misconceptions you have about the degree I studied. The history you were taught in school, or you hear about on the TV - that is not 'real' history. That is watered-down, often inaccurate, history. Degree level history is light years above this, just as degree level science is so far removed from those BBC programmes about the planets. Your vision of a society where a tiny portion of people hold all the knowledge and the 'rest of us' get what 'filters down' is just as dystopian as one where 5% hold all the wealth, or the army holds all the power. If you'd like to stay in the 'rest of us' and just take whatever crumbs of information the elites decide to give you, then that's your choice. If, however, other people would like to go to university, then that's their choice too, and you have no right to limit this because they choose to study a particular subject.

true,Julian1986,null,null,"I think the general public will agree with you (and your comment has more relevance unlike the unusually crazy Guardian comments)  

A couple of points:

* Credit default swaps are very simple.  They are also very easy to implement. 
 
* The ignorance argument actually related to the board rooms and a lack of transparency in CDOs.  Some executives didn't understand the loss of liquidity in CDOs so decided to buy the CDOs they couldn't sell.  Bear Sterns, the most notable bank to do this, lost billions from this (in fact they lost an amount comparable to how much they had made in their whole 40 year history!!).

* Most banks lost money due to a liquidity crisis and not bad practise; they were borrowing from other banks.  When inter-bank lending ceased their business models become fubar.  Notable example is Northern Rock.

* It almost follows that recessions are naturally occurring events.  I do feel this one was worse than it should have been due to lapse regulation, lack of transparency in products (and the fact billionaires and institutions were greedy[in the technical sense] enough to buy such things) and how cheap credit had become.  See credit cycles for a simple theory on why they are naturally occurring.

* The average person in a bank will not get a large bonus, have sports cars and multiple homes (even first homes!).  They are hard working, pay taxes and are normally the top graduates.  You got to get into the top percentiles before you are seeing massive bonuses (and with such a pool of talented people all chasing after a few positions it is near impossible).  You get that in many industries (art, music, programming, film) so it shouldn't be a point of contention.  I think the average a few years back was in the £70,000 mark, which isn't that good for London and the calibre of graduate they attract.

* Back room staff do get bonuses (I did).  Hell, even secretaries get bonuses.

* The lack of regulation was due to an unsound process.  CDOs were made in America then sold in London.  The FSA did near zero regulation because that was the SECs job.  The SEC had a much more Laissez-faire attitude than we would ever have.  You could argue it was set up like this to have the least regulation as possible, but then that is also the responsibility of the regulators and not so much the banks (unless they did it knowing the products were shit).

JFTR: What are your thoughts on the fact that this was actually designed to happen. I heard this from a few different LSE professors whilst working there over the years.

The theory goes: Cheap credit is injected into a market up to a saturation point causing a boom, then the central banks pull money from the system, effectively removing the ability of debtors to pay causing their credit to default and the system to crash. They then move in and buy back the assets at pennies on the dollar ( as the Americans are so fond of saying ) thus profiting massively. Seemingly it's happened a few times in the US i.e. the Great Depression and the story of the Greenback.

There are many reasons he may have wanted to encrypt his drive, and many reasons he wouldn't want to give the key to the filth, but as you say: ""what the hell it's a free country""

&gt; the police arriving at his door probably means that they have evidence that child pornography was purchased in the house

You might think so, but you'd be wrong. There is no suggestion in the article that kiddie porn was payed for. More importantly the amount of evidence the filth need to get a warrant rubber stamped by a magistrate is practically nil. If someone were to find out your address and make three anonymous tip offs of drugs being dealt from your house from three phone boxes near by, that would be enough ""soft intelligence"" for them to get a warrant to raid your house on suspicion of drugs (that  example comes from a police man by the way).

I am strongly sceptical because everyone has lost out.  The rich, the middle-classes, the poor and those in charge; the same is typically said to have happened in the great depression.  

The cheap credit explanation I favour is something called the Greenspan put.  Greenspan essentially tried to keep the market rising with cheap credit.  I see recessions as a natural thing so I would be more pre-occupied with the amount of credit available and where it is going, to avoid deep recessions as opposed to avoid shallow recessions and causing a deep one.

I am still waiting for a definitive research paper to come out on the causes (and possibly going to start one if one does not appear soon).  I am particularly interested in the effect consumer confidence and our increased information sharing abilities have.  Overall I would say we still don't quite now the cause of the crisis; although a lot of people would rightly disagree with what I have just said :D.

Credit definitely got too cheap and CDOs definitely need more regulation.  CDOs at minimum should include enough information to calculate their worth, which they shockingly didn't!  They have credit risk but people thought they had abstracted around it (technically they had with their initial data, but life doesn't conform to initial data).  Unfortunately it and cheap credit led to loans given out to people who had absolutely no way of paying them back, yet the assumption that the top tranche was worth something still existed.  

I can't find the psychological condition I like to use to explain what happened, but it occurred when an America ship shot down a Iranian plane.  They were trained to see something (a missile laden plane or loan opportunity's) that weren't there.  With the banking crisis this occurred at all levels in American societies - people got more and more loans from companies that could sell more and more collateralised(sp?) loans to more and more customers who could buy better and better debt.  Clearly the debt couldn't be getting better and better but it appeared it was.

With the gambling comment it is fair to say it is similar to roulette in good times and poker in bad times - although the odds are so wildly different that all the talk of gambling is maybe not the most appropriate terms (risk is taken, but there is such a low level of public understanding on risk it should probably just be called investing).  This discussion has spurned me on to start my paper so I can show the risk/reward ratio of casino games :D.  Essentially with stocks and bonds you can calculated the value of what you will get in good times.   In bad times you have to put on your poker face as you realise you have no idea if your cards are good or not.

right, and what happens arround this time and the few months before every year?
oh yes, people graduate university.

this is like me publishing articles saying *permanent jobs fall during december!"". That also happens every year, once a year, and it's because many companies arent working for 2-3 weeks and so don't take people on then. You could say the same about temporary jobs falling after the christmas period as well.

really, this seems like scaremongering, my own experience is that companies are upping their advertising budgets, taking more risks, and thats resulting in more jobs.

&gt;It can be argued that the law which allows the filth to do this breaches article 8 of the human rights act: ""Right to Respect for Private and Family Life"", and Article 1 of the First Protocol: ""Protection of Property"".

I'd like to hear that argument. Any argument that forbids the investigation of an individual on the grounds that it breaches their right to privacy would interest me.

That said, 

Also, section 2 of ""Right to Respect for Private and Family Life"" states:

*""There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.""*

This says to me that ones right to privacy is not universal. As for the burden of proof, saying that evidence can be faked is no argument at all. Of course it can, but just because it can doesn't mean that all evidence should be dismissed. Neither of us have any idea of the quality of the evidence used to obtain the warrant.

Aso the rest of your post - I can't argue the legal details. However there are lots of good arguments on the web elsewhere about why that specific law potentially breaches the human rights act in various ways, not limited to the requirement to hand over passwords. I fiundamentally disagree with the nanny-state big-brother ideals that New Labour subscribed to when they brought in a lot of laws (not just RIPA), and believe they should be scrapped, or at least seriously reconsidered. I have great hopes for the Great Repeal Bill, which should be coming at some point soon. 

And my original point was that we don't know any details of this case other than approximately what this guy has been accused of, and that he wouldn't hand over his password. We cannot jump to conclusions in either direction about what he has or has not done. For a variety of reasons I am not inclined to trust the filth and assume they are in the right until it can be shown that they are in each specific case. 

Oh, and for the record, I am not trying to defend this guy, I am trying to attack this law and the assumptions of guilt that people have made because of it and some shoddy reporting.

This is a very simple that you DO NOT SEEM TO FUCKING GRASP: it is encrypted. If the encryption cannot be broken, then NO. No-one can ever see what it was.

Just because some people who sit in a building pass some rules that suits them and their way of life, does not mean for one second that they should be obeyed by people who feel that those rules contravene, discriminate or contradict their own internal morality.

In the language that you have used: no, they do not have any **rights** whatsoever to make any such demands on anyone for anything. 

You do not seem to grasp that if enough people choose to ignore or even flout a specific law, it is rendered beyond useless. It is unworkable, unenforceable, completely dead and irrelevant. It is not a case that the sky will fall or the universe implode if it is broken.

Just as homosexuality was considered a crime up until the late 1960's in the UK, it did not stop people 'breaking' those laws, despite what the threats of consequence were. Attitudes that those laws were immoral and contravened modern thinking reached critical mass and they were eventually repealed. 

Just because a certain law exists on the statute books, it does not mean it is morally correct, defensible, a universal axiom or just. It is a rule that has been decided between people who usually can be quite out of touch and not have any ones interests but their own, or their sponsors, in mind.

I will leave this like this: you are a sheep who cannot see past your pen. You are fenced in by your own mental limitations. You are a slave to a morality that has been given to you and you have blindly accepted. Not one that you have fought for, sweated over and forged out of your own convictions and fortitude.

It eventually failed because it was shown the Government could do a better job and encapsulate more people if they put the effort in. I don't think the values that eschew the virtue of voluntary work really apply in modern days and it seems like a huge pipe dream to expect new voluntary organisations to take over roles in society from government and be remotely efficient.

I don't think now is the right time to try develop anything like this. So far, the Coalition has been firing salvo after salvo into the support infrastructure keeping some people alive since the recession - they are negatively impacting the public opinion of them by their insistence that the Welfare State needs significant reforms that cut people off from benefits at a time when there is a lack of jobs to support them.

They are doing too much too fast and I can't see any amount of political spin being able to help them if this remotely starts to go to pot.

I use throwaway accounts for EVERY post I use.  I'm sick to death of the extended arguments on Reddit.  My old username (which I've been using since Reddit was first launched) was a sad mix of wonderful conversations punctuated by the most ridiculous, virulent arguments you could imagine.   

When people respond, they often look at your comment history and I wasn't prepared to have those comments associated back to me anymore.   So now I use throwaway accounts... same password, different username - keeps it REAL simple and my comment history is zero, apart from the article I'm commenting on.

People make the same mistake over and over again - I had one guy take a shot at me and simply by looking at his comment history and (Wait for it) searching for his username on Google, I found out where he lived, his marital status, his employer, the names of his children and dog etc.   He was a real prick but basically he was stupid.  I prefer to remain anonymous on Reddit and other sites, hence the geosweeper pseudonym I used for this comment.  I must have created 4 usernames in the last 24hrs on 4 separate posts.

So whilst I understand what you are saying (and I can't change your mind or your opinion) my explanation above is the best I can do.   I've been on Reddit far too long and whilst the articles are amazing, the comments section can turn into a pile of rubbish far too quickly these days.   I'm not getting paid for shit.

Before you start arguing with me, take a look at the following - I got this in under 3 minutes because YOU have made the same mistake - I sincerely urge you to STOP using your username cross-site:  (I've left out the more personal stuff).

My quick summary: If it's a sensible encryption like AES (and given that they've been trying to crack it for over a year now, it sounds like it is) and if the passphrase is 50 characters (I suspect this is roughly how large the key is in bits, converted to bytes), it's gonna take forever. He'll be dead before they work it out.

Memorising a random 50 character string is not only possible but pretty easy, if you put your mind to it.

Someone made the point that they might know some of the contents based on ISP snooping and other data. This is a step removed from a simple ""known plaintext"" attack, and even then AES is secure against such an attack.

However, the cause of Britain's *real* financial problem is not the global recession (and the subsequent banking bailout), which exacerbated the situation and made a future problem a present problem.

The root problem is the deficit, for while we continue as a nation to exceed our income, we are creating more debt and at the levels of year-on-year spending that Labour took on post-2001 [(when they actually had the deficit under control)](http://www.debtbombshell.com/images/uk-budget-deficit.png) we are crippling our ability to clear our debt (hence why the bailout has only exacerbated the situation).

So while the Tories in the past haven't been much better, after successfully getting it under control, Labour promised the world at no extra costs and proceeded to spend, spend, spend.  Presumably the Iraq war was the catalyst, with Labour discovering that irresponsible spending appeared to have *no* negative consequences, especially once they were re-relected in 2005.

For a while, a couple of years really, I couldn't ride in cars. 

Yep, I totally couldn't. I'd jump in the passenger's seat and whatever friend was taking me somewhere just wasn't cautious enough for me. I'd calculate the directions, braking, traffic and was sure we'd snuff it at any moment. The odds, you see, the odds weren't with us.

They never are.

But now I'm so over that irrational or not fear. Why, just last year I rode with a friend on a dry lakebed at 100mph while doing a hit of nitrous oxide. You know if it's going to be your moment to die, your day, your second -- well make sure you've had a great day.

Make sure that every day is a good day to die and you'll find you no longer worry about death at all. Considering the amazingly brilliant odds of even your self awareness, let alone your geology, biology or the sociology that got you here, the cultures and ancestors that made you -- why you should be grateful for each second you've drawn a breath, and made a prayer of every song. And this is what always makes me smile; you are here to go. You were born to have an end. You were started and you will die. Be thankful for it, and have a nice... no, have the best day possible.

From a quick Google.  I get UK's GDP at $2.67 Trillion, and India's at $1.16 Trillion.   

Draw your own conclusions about changes in GDP in the near future.  At the moment the UK is still above India in raw spending.  It waits to be seen if India can achieve this increase in spending as % of GDP though.  At the moment its just the word of a politician.

We seem to have the ability to punch above our weight when it comes to science.  However the UK does not have the divine right sit above India in anything.  If we don't start paying attention, then in the near future we might be the manufacturing base for the Indian middle classes.

And I was just so, so fortunate to have such a *tremendous* fanbase behind me- of course Christopher did a fantastic job of getting the ball rolling and re-introducing people to the Doctor - he'd done most of the work to make people willing to support me, willing to...well, *believe* in me...well, from the start actually.

And Matt...he's just doing a *tremendous, tremendous* job and I know he's feeling that wonderful, *wonderful* support from the older fans and of course the young ones, the newer ones, who have no real understanding of the enormous, *enormous* cultural history that Doctor Who has...the Doctor has shaped British culture for, well, *generations*...and those are enormous shoes for anyone to fill...I think Matt will really get to feel that fantastic *rush* one gets as the fanbase swells and he grows into the role that so many have made their own before him.

And he's in a very tough spot. Chris started the ball rolling and, when I was the Doctor I think the...the...international *obsession* with the character peaked. Now of course people are settling in, the Doctor has more of a...comfortable place in the British consciousness...like an old shoe...and I think it's going to be Matt's job to keep things on an even keel...rather than attempt to keep up that magnificent creative explosion that the show experienced when I was the Doctor.

I was fortunate to get to work with Russell - Russel Davies - who was really responsible for breathing new life into this phenominal series - really it was his...his...*vision* that made all this possible - that made my job just that much easier.

Matt would have loved working with Russell. I think Russell, perhaps more than any of us, has a *true* feel for who the Doctor is, and who he should be.

I think Steve - Steven Moffat - who wrote three or four of the most *daring* episodes under Russell -  really learned a lot when we all worked together.  And I think he'll surprise us all - he's really got his best before him - as does Matt - and I'm really, *really* excited to see where they take this next.

But yes. The Doctor is...well, eternal. And the beauty of him is that he always changes. It doesn't matter if one particular incarnation lasts several years, like Tom Baker's, or only a series or two, like poor Colin's.

Virgin Media is set to extend its super-fast broadband network by using infrastructure owned by BT, in a move that will underline the escalating battle between the two internet access providers.

Virgin, the UK’s third-biggest broadband provider, is interested in providing high-speed internet access by running fibre optic cables along BT’s telegraph poles so as to reach homes.

BT to let consumer demand shape superfast broadband - Oct-04

Such arrangements could help Virgin to expand its network coverage to as many as 16m of the UK’s 26m homes.

Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, on Thursday unveiled plans to require BT to let rivals gain access to its telegraph poles, so as to string fibre cables between them.

Ofcom also said BT should let rivals have access to its underground ducts, so that they can run fibre cables through the tunnels.

The duct and pole proposals by the regulator would enable BT’s rivals to reduce the substantial cost of building high-speed broadband networks to homes, because they would not have to dig up roads to lay fibre cables.

Ed Richards, Ofcom chief executive, said its proposals struck a balance between promoting competition and investment in super-fast broadband services.

Virgin asked BT for access to its ducts and poles this year, but the two companies were unable to reach an agreement.

Virgin therefore welcomed Ofcom’s plans to require BT to let rivals have access to its ducts and poles, saying: “This is an important step that rightly focuses on opening up areas of the country not already served by super-fast broadband, removing one of the hurdles that make such developments near impossible at present.”

Virgin’s high-speed network covers 12.7m homes, mainly in towns and cities. The cable television operator is planning to run the network past another 400,000 homes by the end of 2012. It is also considering extending the network further by running fibre cables over telegraph poles, notably in some rural areas.

Ian Watt, analyst at Enders Analysis, said: “We expect Virgin Media to expand its existing network footprint to about 15.5m households.”

BT, the UK’s largest internet access provider, is building a super-fast broadband network that will cover 4m homes by the end of this year, and 17m by 2015.

It welcomed how Ofcom had concluded it should not impose price controls on its wholesale high-speed broadband products.

TalkTalk, Britain’s second-largest broadband provider, is planning to use BT’s wholesale products. Some analysts say TalkTalk lacks the resources to build its own fibre network in the short term.

I yer looking for landscape then the road from Glasgow, up through the Trossachs and Loch Lomond, over the Rannoch and up into Glen Coe. Go on to Fort William. That would be a great Day 1 with stops. For Day 2 you can go up the Great Glen to Inverness and take the East coast back down to Edinburgh.

An alternative on public transport would be to go from Glasgow to Gourock and over to Dunoon on the ferry and get the bus up to Castle Carrick and Argyle.

The EDL were clearly out for trouble. The UAF and other locals were peaceful ( reports of a few locals angrily having a go at coaches) and were  generally reclaiming the streets and not being forced to do as the EDL told them. There were Nazi salutes for the EDL leader, there were racist taunts and attacks. Sky shockingly tried to suggest the UAF were antagonizing ( still had to hide in their vans from an EDL attack though). Following tweets of eyewitnesses this was just not the case.

Meanwhile, the EDL bussed in 1000 ""people"" who just so happened to have firecrackers ( saw a video, looked more like a fucking stick of dynamite/ Sherbet Fountain ), smoke bombs and other assorted weapons. Now where did those come from? Were they just laying about the place or was a branch of Thugs 'R' Us nearby? They clearly went to stir up trouble. Police reports were at odds with what people were posting. A KFC got attacked as well as a Primark? Huh? Main media reporting of this has been piss poor. Meanwhile, they don't like burkas but do like balaclavas.

The police (despite the reporting they gave) seemed to do a good job. The EDL gave up any pretence of being peaceful, fighting for rights and not being racist. But we all knew that anyway. They came, they saw, they wasted people's time and money. And they achieved bugger all.

Seriously though I'd personally stay in Glasgow and use that as my base for exploration. It's an interesting city- old with a long and convoluted history that's worth reading up about if you're going to go there. It's the UK's third-largest and suffers somewhat as a result of bad urban planning but there's a lot of stuff to see and do there. It often comes across as being a poorer cousin to Edinburgh, but I think that does the city a great disservice. 

From there it's convenient to visit Stirling by train- takes about 30 minutes to get there- to see the castle and the (William) Wallace Monument.  

For scenery your best bet might be, and I say this somewhat reservedly, a day-trip by coach to Aviemore in the Cairngorms National Park. The downside is that it's quite touristy- you can buy all sorts of *authentically Scottish* tat such as haggis in a tartan can and Scottish Piper souvenir dolls (honestly- who the hell buys that crap?) at inflated prices- but that doesn't detract from its setting in a beautiful part of the country, plus it's one of the easier places to get to on public transport- still a 2½ hour train journey each way from Glasgow- and deliberately designed to cater for tourists as well as part them from their money.

If you were staying longer I'd recommend going to Skye or any of the islands but the problem is that the most picturesque scenery is in the remotest areas, which are difficult to get to on public transport and wouldn't really be suitable for visiting if you're only staying for a weekend as nearly all your time would be taken up with travelling.

Nor did the UAF have gas cannisters , fireworks and other missiles. They did not attack an art center in the name of anti-fascism. As a whole, the vast majority standing up against EDL did so with a manner that made the anti-fascist movement and Leicester proud.

Better a pratt than an apologist.

The onus is on you for evidence. Your assumption is not logical. It's an assumption. There are people that have been involved with the UAF that have used non-legal means. Absolutely granted. Same with any organisation. But to say this means the EDL are comparable is ludicrous. There are fishmongers who have engaged in bad activity. And priests. OK, the last one was a bad choice. I also have plenty of gay and black friends. Hey? What?

Did I mention Stalin and Hitler. Uh uh. No no no. I mentioned Cable Street. And people fighting the fascists were pulled up before the beak. But since you mention unsavory people, I will not call Godwin, but will say there was a slight conflict afterwards. And of course anyone slightly lefty is a soviet demagogue of this period too. Obviously the UAF that has support from the current PM is a great comparison. I said no lazy thinking.

The UAF have no point..except..er...standing against racists and fascists. Not important to you? Then you say how having a different perspective is not a perspective and they are disgraceful. So there is now the universal truth of cem22lp? Didn't call you a hypocritical idiot. Probably even bright enough to do something at degree level. Doesn't make you a star. I suggested you were masking opinions and were a lazy thinker.

income tax works here in 'bands' so what happens is say the first 9k of your wage, isnt taxxed at all (this amount varies per circumstances). 

up to 37,400 above that, you pay 20% tax on it (except for the 9k, which you pay on on).

from £37,401-£150,000 you pay 40% on the amount above 37,400 , plus the 20% on the 9-37400 bracket.

anything over 150k is taxxed at 50%, but again, below it, you pay the lower rates. (so, 20% on 9 to 37400, 40% on 37401-150000).
