It's not only the Doctor though if you look at British icons like Bond or Sherlock Holmes or Hamlet they are all imperfect. We really don't have many very black and white characters in our fiction.

The Doctor has never been perfect, ever. He has always been flawed and not only has he lied but sometimes he gets people into trouble or his principles disallow him from doing the right thing. He has got people killed, got a lot of people hurt and created bad situations through his own meddling.

Doctor Who in some ways is incredible. The man is a genius and he cares about those around him but at other times he lets his emotions get the better of him, he won't do whats necessary for the greater good due to his own inbuilt principles and he deceives people around him including his own companions often times. 

Honestly my advice to you is if you are offended by the doctor decieving people then stop watching Doctor Who because these themes have been around since the first doctor, in fact look at what wikipedia says about the first Doctor:

**He also harboured a streak of ruthlessness, being willing to lie — and in one case attempt to kill — to achieve his goals.**

Normally I would say that anything not directly related to the cracks in time happened.  I.E. The Daleks still appeared in Churchill's bunker, The Silurian incident still happened, etc.  The crack was merely a threatening detail in the background of those events, but did not serve as the catalyst for them.  

The atraxi/prisoner zero incident had the time crack as its catalyst, so it's possible prisoner zero is locked up and never escaped (Though the incident still happened for The Doctor and his companions of course, though the rest of the universe might not have experienced it).

I think the alliance may have never actually formed, and that's where it becomes hard to unravel thing.  The alliance only formed because of the cracks, so if they were all sealed, all the races probably never joined.

The sea vampire race (can't remember their name) probably never even came to Venice, and every member of that race that died in the episode would be safe on their home planet never knowing what had transpired for The Doctor.

And the same reason that they were able to catch the Doctor was because of the crack in Amy Pond's wall.  The cracks poured memories into her head and changing the way she remembered(she didn't know about daleks).

Ok.  1)  Rory didn't remember because up until the time that Amy remembered and brought the doctor back, noone remembered him.  Sort of like a kick start.  By same logic, Amy wasn't the same Amy because she lived her adult life without meeting the doctor, but she had memories of him too when he came back(also the nestene rory and young amy in same verse never happened either).  Once she brought back the doctor the universe corrected the memories of the inhabitants.(Think of it like the opposite of the Pandorica. instead of the Doctor being remembered but the universe is destroyed, the Doctor is forgotten but the universe stays on).

2) Same as one, the strange part about Amy remembering was that she could see the Doctor as he went backward, but she could hear him(the angel thing).  I figure dream within a dream, blah blah, television.  I do posit that he was only forgotten only during the relatively short time period that the time-cracks were around(from Amy as a child or WW2 episode to...I guess spaceship UK).

3)  River is something I don't wrap my head around, but here's my thoughts.  Since she and the Doctor continually meet each other in opposite directions of their respective timelines, she would technically be out of the neuralizer waveform 'radius' so she could be there to set it all in motion.

So, all of them have two sets of memories: The Series 5 universe with cracks in the walls, and a different Series 5 universe where there were no cracks.  From what we can tell, most of the stories still happened in the rebooted universe without cracks, just in a different way.  For example, with no cracks, Rory doesn't die.

1. Rory may have met a plastic Rory in another context in the rebooted universe, since he never died, in an unrecorded adventure.

2. The ragged doctor still exists because The Doctor and Amy still met at the early age, etc.  Only without a crack in the wall, one wonders what their first adventure really was.

3. We don't really know why River remembered anything but if the Doctor left clues for Amy to remember he could have easily done the same to River.

It makes part of it bad.. but I can forgive that. It's only TV after all; while I do find many plot points to be downright lazy, I really enjoyed the episodes all the same.

*1) The Pandorica is known to everyone except humans: It's a trap for the Doctor, everyone knows that the Doctor loves Earth and Humans, so don't tell them (easy, they don't have much contact friendly contact with aliens), and hide the Pandorica on Earth, somewhere that they can easily lure the Doctor to*

Do we know this for a fact? Or are you just theorizing? Good theory, don't get me wrong, but I don't remembe hearing anything about its origins being off of Earth.

*2) Guarded by a lone cyberman. ""Skin of metal and a body that never ages"", seems like a good candidate for a guard where the prisoner could show up at any time.*

Doesn't seem like much of a guard to me, given the gravity of the Pandorica and what goes inside, but sure. (Remember, too.. the Pandorica is empty at that moment... so what's he guarding?)

*3) The Judoon. a) He did piss them off during, he ran away when they ordered him to help them (The Stolen Earth), b) they are police for hire, c) they were told that joining the alliance would save all of existence, of course they would join up.*

Well, there are pissoffs and there are pissoffs. He ran away from a handful of Judoon once. If they're pissed off about it, okay. On the other hand, he killed every Dalek in existence (except for those that slipped away). Those guys have much more reason to be peeved.

*4) Putting the Doctor in the Pandorica fixes the crack. No, it causes them, and it causes the end of all existence, a self fulfilling prophecy, and the reason that they didn't try to take over the earth.*

What I meant was that his enemies believed putting him in the Pandorica would fix the crack. Not that it actually does.

*5) Working together with mortal enemies. They care about self preservation above all else. If it's a choice between working with mortal enemies or ceasing to exist, they choose working with mortal enemies, that's why it's called an alliance.*

**Keeper**: Is *anyone* at all confident in either Hilario or Turnbull based on their performances during pre-season or the Carling Cup? Hilario did admirably last year but he looked terrible in the Community Shield. I think we should chase Begovic once more.

**Centre Back**: We're solid here. Terry and Alex are tough customers, although a bit injury prone. Solid, solid cover provided by Ivanovic though, and we do have Bruma if need be. I wish Chelsea would keep Mancienne around and give him a chance though.

**Side Back**: Solid here as well. Cole and Bosingwa are world-class, Zhirkov, Ferreira, van Aanholt, even Malouda can provide cover if need be.

**Central Midfield**: Tough call. Starters are Lampard, Essien, Mikel. If Mikel goes down, we can shift Essien back and throw in Ramires. Zhirkov and McEachran are both excellent covers for these positions. Maybe another youngster would be good here though. Unlikely to happen, but Rodwell or some other player who is capable at either holding midfield or as an all-action midfielder would be nice.

**Wide forwards**: Solid. Malouda and Anelka are excellent compliments for Drogba, with Kalou, Zhirkov (again!), Sturridge, Borini and Kakuta able to slot in as well. Good mix of experience and youth.

**Centre forward**: We need to look to the future with this position. Drogba is world-class, IMO the best striker in the world, hands down. But he's 32.

true,not_nathan,rory,Rory,"This season put a lot of focus on memories. Despite the fact that in the Doctor Who Universe, time is shifting constantly, and your past isn't always going to stay the same, apparently memory is partially disassociated with actual history. That actually covers a lot of ground viz a viz avoiding time paradoxes.

Anyway, in the end of The Big Bang, a seed the whole universe is remembered by the Pandorica, so it can be restored, except for the bits that involves The Doctor, since he'll be on the wrong side. But *Amy* has especially powerful memory, so she had a seed of The Doctor and his influence on the universe, as well as her parents, so they can be restored, too.

Think of it like wiping a hard drive and reinstalling the operating system (the universe from the Pandorica), and then adding some of your favorite programs (The Doctor and Amy's parents from Amy's brain). Since Amy had such a strong effect on the universe, she could restore Rory's experiences with The Doctor as well.

One last thing: apparently when something gets brought back by memory, the entirety of it comes back, not just the remembered parts. Sort of like Gallifrey in the End of Time. Once a significant portion of a timeline is restored to the universe, the rest follows in a cascade temporal event.

tl;dr: How many times do we have to say ""wibbly wobbly timey wimey"" before people realize that this series plays fast and loose with time travel logic.

It'll be interesting to see how we handle it, if Drogba and Anelka were to retire today, we have 3 left foot forwards and 1 right foot. I don't think Sturridge is strong enough to play in the CF role that Drogba does, so I'd probably put Kalou in that position and on the left Malouda, which leaves a blank on the right. Sturridge might work there, but I think Kakuta is more likely to be a long term prospect than Sturridge. Having Kakuta to cut inside and take shots (somewhat in the mould of Arjen Robben) would be great, however I'm not sure it's his style. He seems more likely to look to want to dribble past players and finish one on one than shoot from distance. That's just what I've seen of him though.

On the topic of youth, I think what Carlo is doing now with McEachran is great. He's getting 15 minute cameos at the end of games and that's surely going to be great for his development. I don't want to go as far as to say he's the future of Chelsea, but he's a bright prospect nevertheless. The fact that he's only 17 and is the most promising of our youth is brilliant too. Would be great to have someone with the passes he has in him playing first team.

2.) TARDIS? (a big stretch, but River does know how to pilot the TARDIS better than the Doctor and she did tell him that she ""learned from the best... unfortunately [you] were busy that day""... also, the Doctor always refers to the TARDIS as a ""she"").

CCTV *can* show the entire story, but most of the time it doesn't, and I'm even talking from experience on one particular occasion where I got assaulted, but the CCTV was only facing a part of the street that showed the guy running off and me and my friends running after him (putting *us* in a bad light).

People are convicted based on the crimes they can be proved committing. Whether or not CCTV shows the full story or not, if you're shown to be breaking the law, regardless of the scope of the situation, you will be prosecuted for it. Regardless of media coverage, this is exactly what will happen when/if it reaches court.

Further to this, the video footage isn't quite clear and that is either because BBC prefer to convey it in as much of a mysterious/controversial manner as they can (or the individual journalist prefers, perhaps) in order to receive the most attention. Or the CCTV is just inconclusive and doesn't show clearly whether or not the officers were acting in defence.

That said, I can't imagine what this guy could've done to make that officer feel that punching extremely hard to the head several times was an adequate response.

If you have to suffix a statement with ""not to be a dick or anything"" then that should be a warning that you are, in fact, being a dick. Just as ""I don't like to complain"" and ""I'm not racist but..."" are never a good sign.

Anyway the bulk of your post seems to be vaguely contradictory, with a paranoid swipe at the BBC thrown in for good measure. Ultimately you conclude that:

Essentially agreeing with my (admittedly not hugely eloquent): ""Doesn't look great tbh.""

My overall point was that the Superintendent using the particular argument that ""CCTV never shows the whole story"", wasn't particularly compelling. The footage shows someone buried under 3 people, and being savagely punched in the head by one of them. It seemed a little hypocritical to me to have cameras all over the place but then to dismiss them when they show one of your guys in a less than positive light.

Because if you're paying the same as waiters, they'll do something else instead. The best CEOs have multi-disciplinary skill sets, involving leadership, finance and sales. If a sales-focused CEO was faced with a waiter's salary, they'll go back to being sales managers. If a tech-oriented CEO was faced with a waiter's salary, they'll go back to a high paying technical job.

I'm not saying there aren't shit CEOs, there are, and far too many.

*Citation needed*. There are a shitload of doctors in various fields that went into it because it's a well paying respected job. I know at least 2 different Indian doctors and 3 nurses who studied for exactly that reason. It costs an absolute fortune to study to be a Doctor, so you do expect to be well paid at the end of it.

Corporation tax in France is higher than the UK. 

There's less tax avoidance in the US due to better enforcement and the fact that *worldwide* assets of US corporations, citizens and residents are taxable, so shifting it around won't get you very far (you can lie, but that then makes it evasion rather than avoidance).

Corporations (e.g. Cadbury Schweppes) are already funnelling their profits from the UK into Irish subsidiaries to avoid paying any UK tax.

Other than probably being legally impossible, those renting to the state sector while not being in full ownership of the property should be forced to take no more than the payment to cover their pre-agreed mortgage repayments as that's what the unemployed who claim mortgage relief get.

It would drain the profit from the buy to let sector, dampen down house prices, and perhaps encourage a reduction in rents across the board.  

There is an obsession in the UK with home ownership, as if tying yourself to 25 years worth of debt is something to aspire to.  
In countries with higher rates of renting, the trend is for unemployment to be lower as if nothing else structural unemployment is lower when the barriers to relocation are less arduous.

I don't really see how our economy can be fixed until all of us accept that much of our housing stock is in need a painful devaluation.  Maybe everyone will be plunged into negative equity, but that's moral hazard for you.

The reality is the BBC has to tie itself in knots trying to please all the people all the time. They need viewing figures to justify themselves so they have to compete with the commercial channels, and that means finding ways to hang on to viewers. Every commercial channel has been using those methods for years. If the BBC loses viewers it loses it's justification to get the money it survives on. So they show crap at the times when no one with any choice, or any braincells left, is watching. They get good viewing figures, they get the money, they make a few hundred hours of the best tv you will see anywhere in the world, and they show it as often as they can. 

Sorry if this comes across argumentatively, I just think almost all tv is shit and the BBC is absolutely the best thing around. But it's under a lot of pressure right now from the government and private sector, and I think it needs all the support it can get so it can keep making the fantastic programmes it does, even if it does have to fill endless hours with viewer baiting crap as a trade off.

Also, think of it this way: 18 weeks is about a third of a year, and I read somewhere that sticking someone in the clink costs 40000 a year. That measn that the state is spending about 13 and a half thousand quid on this abhorrent bollocks at a point when the entire country is supposed to be tightening its belt.

The idea that Scotland would somehow be expected to meet the full cost for the bank bail-outs the Scots Parliament had nothing to do with is complete propaganda nonsense. What's the unionist alternative? Dependence? Being told that we are too poor to go it alone? If we are too poor to go it alone, then that doesn't say much for 300+ years of London rule.

They can take pressure off when times are tough by lowering taxes and when times are good they can implement measures to limit inflation. However, it's up to companies where they choose to conduct their business and a large number of influential businesses are directed from a European/global level these days. So in terms of big money business, they're looking to work in long established commercial areas which Wales has never had. Simply put, Parliament did not say ""fuck Wales"", people seeking profit did. A good example of this in work is how there are very few mines or large scale ironworks in England any more since the smart businessmen go overseas for cheaper labour.

Secondly, I can't see how Wales would be any better off if it was truly independent. Your share of government funding may appear quite small, but then how much does Wales actually contribute in taxes (and remember a lot of tax comes from the commercial sector)? There are many areas of England that contribute very little to the economy and trust me we get no better treatment than the Welsh.

true,norwegianwood,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"As a Brit (English) who has spent five years living in Scotland and another six years living in Norway, my view is that smallness of the country has relatively little to do with it. Actually, neither does oil revenues - which only applies to Norway - yet the other Scandinavian countries also seem to be 'pretty awesome' places to live.

I think it has far more to do with the national character and attitudes towards society. Although I don't doubt that Scotland has a national character distinct from that of the English, both characters are far closer to each other than they are to Scandinavian attitudes. This closeness of character is what you might call Britishness.

You could give Scotland independence and allocate most of the North Sea oil revenues north of the border (some of the North Sea is offshore from England) and it would still remain much closer to today's Scotland in character than today's Norway.

To learn more about Scandinavian culture read about [Janteloven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jante_Law) which does much to explain why Scandinavian societies are the way they are.  The Scots aren't going to change their national ethos any time soon and so Scandinavian lifestyles will probably remain an unattained aspiration in Scotland.

1. The need to create and pay for an Army/Airforce/Navy, a healthcare system, an education system, and the other systems that we rely on but are taken care of by being British.

2. The possible economic ruin we would face if the economies of the world took a down turn (again) and we did not have the rest of the UK to help us weather it (See Ireland).

3. The decline in importance in world politics, right now as part of Britain we are one of the most important countries in the world and we get a say in a lot of things, with independence we would lose that completely as nobody would really care what we thought or wanted.

4. The effects of the North Sea oil running out (which is due to happen within 50 years) and the impact that will have on the economy (should we be independent) and the job market.

5. The more than likely trend towards living up to stereotypes on an international level to appeal to more tourists (Kilts, Orange wigs, haggis, the whole lot of it) and the utter annoyance that will bring when people expect you to be something you actually are not. 

When i consider those things i see no actual benefit that would be worth independence.

Not to mention i actually quite like being British, and i have no hate the English.

It's a waste of their time/money and my time if I carry out treatment on them if they're not going to even brush their teeth properly. 

I actually enjoy watching people turn their lives around when they listen to you and take advice on board. I enjoy treating those kinds of people.

It isn't up to us to force them to change their ways or suffer. It seems more agreeable to force those who refuse to change their ways to pay a greater amount towards the cost of their care in proportion to the level of effort a dentist has to put towards helping.",0,1288569480,null,0,false,0,c1419nv,t3_dz8p4,t1_c1419nv,t3_dz8p4,null,1426545882,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3
