So that really only leaves Education, Defence and Social Security. (I don’t know where roads and rail come from!?)

I for one would like to hear the details from both main parties of what is spending is going up, down or sideways.  If Vince Cable can give it stab why cant they?

Until then, when they (Tories or Labour) say ""Ill cut spending but not cut XXX"" Ill assume that is a promise to cut W, Y, Z and probably A and B as well.

When asking fans of their favorite sixth doctor episode the answers were much more arbitrarily chosen. Interesting contrast between asking about, say, the fifth doctor's best episodes (by all accounts a much better and more popular doctor) they were very enthusiastically uniformed in their answers.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The idea (of having educated people run the UK in an iterative fashion) is a nice one.

However the manifesto seems to make some pretty bold statements which probably should be a matter for the iterative process rather than written in stone from the start.

Furthermore, the proposed structure is flawed. Why is the ""Prime Minister/Cabinet"" even on there? You have the top UK universites to create strategies, logically able paid volunteers (I guess (in theory) these relate to our modern MPs) to vet the strategies. What benefit does maintaining the prime minister and cabinet have? It seems to me that they add nothing to the process other than an extra layer of bureaucracy, which you'll have plenty of if your involving universities. The only reason for keeping the prime minister I can see are:

a) to give someone/people a position of power
b) to maintain the UK political system

In my mind both of these are not only unneccesary but detrimental.

Finally, from the manifesto it seems to me that the party is seriously hedging it bets. I guess in order to attract less radical voters. I can see the logic in that, but if your going to try and remold the political system in the UK why stop halfway? Make the manifesto the ideals not a collection of weasely statements that tries to appeal to a broad spectrum of voters. Isn't politicians pandering to the latest craze/fear instead of thinking rationally and in the long term the cause of most the problems in the UK?

In short, brilliant idea but I think the proposed implementation is lacking and that the manifesto should be ruthlessly culled, leaving all matters of policy upto the iterative process.

Normally I'd totally agree. Indeed, I usually mention this when people talk about human death. But there's a difference in that with people it can harm. With this cat, I really don't think that's the case. As I said, let's let them have this one.

The ""exploring heaven"" comment was probably a spur of the moment thing to reassure old people and kids and slightly lessen the blow. When my cat died, I had a resurgence of faith and a hope that he was still in existence in some form, in some kind of Heaven or otherwise. Of course it's silly, but I honestly don't think it was meant to be overly religious and I think we should accept that the statement was probably meant in a very innocent way, factually incorrect or otherwise.

&gt; you put no limits on how those choices can be made

There is an incentive, which you could think of as an implicit limitor, that would reduce the types of likely-negative behaviour you described: the competition is to create strategies that best fulfil the goals. If a university decided to create a less effective team, for whatever reason, they would be less competitive, and so theoretically they would have less chance of winning the competition.

How the universities choose their teams, and how they develop their policies is deliberately open to whatever methods they think are best to win the competition; we don't know why we should to restrict them.

&gt; arbitrary selection of universities

The selection is not arbitrary, but may be inaccurate to a greater or lesser degree. This measurement was chosen because some fairly reputable academics think it is one of the best rankings for research. Ultimately, my aim is to pick universities that are highly competent research institutions, and could manage teams. I am not particularly concerned that they are literally the best, since the distribution of earnings should, theoretically, go to better team members (from anywhere) over time, because universities will seek talent to win the competition.

&gt; You need to be much more specific
&gt; Why should we want to make these changes?

We have goals to set boundaries and trajectories on what we want and do not want to happen -- to achieve our aim. The specifics beyond these boundaries are deliberately undecided because apart from the goals, we don't want to unnecessarily constrain or promote particular behaviours.

For that specific example ('may never prevent anyone from conveying information to the public, except when necessary to fulfil the goals of protection'), I have tried to make a reasonable choice of how to create a boundary on government intervention on people's lives. I reason that when we can share most information freely, we can make more informed choices, both for our productivity, and our contentment. I think people can and should discuss whether this is a reasonable choice, and I want to help cultivate, and be part of that process.

I have not yet provided similar explanations for other goals in the manifesto or elsewhere on the website, because I could not predict what further information for people I should provide about the goals, and how I should distribute it. These Reddit conversations are the start of public discussion about the party.


&gt; Current laws, and the way government functions, are highly complex

&gt; handwaving platitudes

The approach of using goals and universities is designed deliberately for this complexity. Maybe the above explanation helps to convey why I think the goals, and the system are not handwaving platitudes. But please ask any more questions on this topic.


&gt; I don't understand

&gt; something different

If someone was working for a company, and they were told to work with carcinogens, and that style of work was stated (as described in the manifesto) by the government as likely to cause specific forms of cancer, if they developed one of those forms of cancer, and it could be shown to have been caused by the work, the worker would have the choices provided in the manifesto regarding that disease.

He might, for example, decide that he wants to perform the work, but also takes out insurance against the chance of developing cancer. He might not be aware of the chance of developing cancer, but have an agreement with his employer that if he develops diseases related to his work, the employer will behave in a specific way. If his employer enforced that he work quicker than he wanted to work (against the any agreement by the worker), and because of this he overlooked that he was working with carginogens, the worker would still have the options given in the manifesto, but would also be able to request punishment of, and protection from, his employer for the treatment that caused him to work in that way.

Before going any further though, I agree that we should encourage healthier lifestyles, this includes encouraging good hygiene, diet and exercise. But we shouldn't **insist** that people conform to lifestyle norms.

I think that in a ""civilised"" society, where the standard of living is high, free healthcare should include treatment for conditions which may be regarded as ""self-inflicted"". Not a doctor, so don't know about the merits of weightloss surgery; my gut feeling (sorry) is that fewer pies, some salad and exercise should be the more favoured option. But there are people with conditions which don't allow them to loose weight in that way, so if the doctor says ""surgery"", sure, why not?

One problem that applies to ""self-inflicted conditions"" is that habits change. E.g. I smoked during my student years and a while after, then stopped (almost ten years ago). Should that affect my entitlement to NHS treatment when I'm older?

I've got friends who picked up injuries playing rugby, falling off motorbikes, paragliding etc. years before, which are becoming costly health issues now they're getting older. Arguably those injuries are as ""self-inflicted"" as stuffing burgers down your Gregory while watching Tricia.

And what about drug / alcohol addiction? Personally I think it's right that treatment should be funded by our taxes, not least because the addiction (sometimes) has social consequences in addition to the personal ones.

So: IMO denying treatment = moral quagmire; ""rich"" society (which this is) should err on the side of compassion.

So, the probability that the Doctor *will at some point* interact with any given individual is roughly 100(X/Y).  The people with whom he will interact in an out-of-order sequence is a subset of X, meaning that the odds are even lower that he'll meet someone for the first time after they already know him.

And as to your last comment, the odds of one of our leaders actually being arrested for war crimes is virtually nil, regardless of if they kill civilians themselves or send people to do it. With the connections a high ranking politician has, they're not going to be brought to justice.

Blair as head of the branch of government which exercises executive control is the one who decides policy and is held accountable as such.
Going to war was a decision that most crucially he made, those in the cabinet who disagreed were forced to resign.

Unlike today's show, the old stories are slower paced, the budgets they had were small, and production schedules were incredibly tight. To a newcomer, sometimes it may feel that you are watching a stage play as opposed to a mini-movie (particularly the first Doctor).

For classic Who recommendations for newcomers, there was a [recent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/aqwql/suggestions_for_watching_classic_doctor_who/) with a good list of titles. That should steer you right. As you've just watched The End of Time, I recommend you check out The War Games, The Three Doctors and The Deadly Assassin. It's the first three stories, over three consecutive Doctors, that heavily involve Gallifrey and show the Time Lords. Knowing what you know now, it makes their first appearance really ominous. All of these are available on DVD.

I am curious how you'll go though. As a long time Who fan since Pertwee's days, viewers of my vintage tend to observe that the Doctor is traditionally a senior or middle aged man who has been played by younger and younger actors over the years. You, on the other hand, will be moving from the regeneration of Tennant into Matt Smith and on to...well...[this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/gallery/mobile/288/william_hartnell.jpg).

Finally, here's a list of where *NOT* to start:
* K9 and Company
* The Horns of Nimon
* The Children in Need special called Dimensions in Time
* Warriors of the Deep

* Twin Dilemma
