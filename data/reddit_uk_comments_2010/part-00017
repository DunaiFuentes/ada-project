No.  Rory is just like the doctor in that sense since they're traveling in the same direction.  The first time River would meet Rory would be his last time with the doctor just as the first time River meets the doctor would presumably be the last time the doctor sees.  Alternatively, think silence in the library.  The last time River meets the doctor is the first time the doctor meets River.

So it's not ""every time is the first time"" but ""the first time is the last time and the last time is the first time.""

However, that doesn't mean I agree with the Order. It's a fundamentally sectarian organisation. The Twelfth is all about celebrating the outcome of a sectarian war which occurred 400 years ago. It has absolutely no relevance today. 

Those who protested and rioted yesterday from the nationalist community are worse. Some people did attempt to protest peacefully, but I think it was foolish of them to attempt to actually block the route of some parades. 

The Twelfth needs to be replaced with an event where ALL sides of the community can come out and celebrate their national identities together. 

The Orange Order marchers are stuck in the past and they badly need to move on. As do many republicans (and the dissidents) 

And as for the rioting kids? That's a failure of a divided education system and poor parenting. In Derry, the very last Protestant school on the cityside is moving out to a new building in the Waterside. Which means that all the Protestant schools will be in the Waterside and all the Catholic schools will be on the cityside. There's only one integrated school here! It's ridiculous!!

* Let's start with the outfit.  It's the only tie-less episode in which he also doesn't wear a t-shirt and multiple layers.  In at least one shot, this means that his shirt is low cut enough in the front to see the tiniest peek of chest hair (specifically an overhear shot in the TARDIS when he's investigating the scribble and then building a device)
* Hand!Porn.  He has some nice hands and between the device building and just a lot of close-up shots of him feeling the sort of energy remains after things vanish, there is just a lot of this.  Lots and lots of hand shots.
* Oral fixation.  There's the licking marmalade off his fingers (and looking adorable when he's caught!) and the general sniffing at things.  I feel it needs to be restated (I asked all of my fangirl friends and the first thing they said was something about the marmalade), he sticks his fingers into marmalade and licks them clean. And he kisses the device he makes.
* Running: He looks damn good doing it.
* Nerd sex appeal: A nice long scene with specs, my own personal weakness.  And doing the Vulcan greeting hand gesture. 
* Cute shippy things.  While I'm not a big Doctor/Rose person, they were damn adorable in this episode.  The hug, the being goofy together, and generally being all gooey towards each other.

MKV is really only useful for videos which have multiple audio tracks, subtitles, or both - This is the reason the format is so popular among Anime snobs, as it gives them the choice between Japanese spoken language with English subtitles (which they describe as ""the only way to watch anime""), and English spoken language with no subtitles (which they describe as ""sheer torture, and wrong in every possible way"").

Al Megrahi was NOT released under the PTA. The application was refused by Kenny MacAskill. Excerpt form his speech made on 20 August 2009;

&gt;It was clear that both the United States Government and the American families objected to a prisoner transfer. They did so on the basis of agreements they said had been made, prior to trial, regarding the place of imprisonment of anyone convicted.

&gt;The United States Attorney General, Eric Holder, was in fact deputy Attorney General to Janet Reno at the time of the pre-trial negotiations. He was adamant that assurances had been given to the United States Government that any person convicted would serve his sentence in Scotland. Many of the American families spoke of the comfort that they placed upon these assurances over the past ten years. That clear understanding was reiterated to me, by the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

&gt;I sought the views of the United Kingdom Government. I offered them the right to make representations or provide information. They declined to do so. They simply informed me that they saw no legal barrier to transfer and that they gave no assurances to the US Government at the time. They have declined to offer a full explanation as to what was discussed during this time, or to provide any information to substantiate their view. I find that highly regrettable.

&gt;I therefore do not know what the exact nature of those discussions was, nor what may have been agreed between Governments. However, I am certain of the clear understanding of the American families and the American Government.

&gt;Therefore it appears to me that the American families and Government either had an expectation, or were led to believe, that there would be no prisoner transfer and the sentence would be served in Scotland.

&gt;**It is for that reason that the Libyan Government's application for prisoner transfer for Abdelbasit Ali Mohmed Al-Megrahi I accordingly reject.**

Had Al Megrahi remained in good health he would have stayed where he was - in prison.

He was released, but this was on compassionate grounds, not because of the PTA.",0,1279108076,null,0,false,0,c0u8hwi,t3_cpeud,t1_c0u8hwi,t3_cpeud,null,1426379123,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

The great BP media blackout and lies. What media blackout eaxctly? I've been on their site everyday since this happened and it tells you in a daily reports *exactly* what they are doing to try and fix this and clean it up, they are holding nothing from the US public here as to what is being done. 

It even stated earlier on that the size of the leak in barrels was not known because they actually *didn't* know and couldn't calculate it so they were estimating it. 

The   coast guard and BP are stopping people going near the beaches, not because they don't want people taking photographs, but because there are some massive health and safety issues going on here, crude oil is pretty toxic stuff, you don't want people messing around in it.

Also: Just the other day I watched a vicious report on some huge cover up and BP trying to play down the scale of the disaster by pouring sand on the top of oil on beaches so the oil couldn't be seen. Of course they are, sand is one of the best ways to soak up oil,  has nobody in the US ever spilt oil on a garage floor?

If I illustrated your thinking was weak at best and you continued, to call you stupid would not be a problem as would be a ""fact"" and ""common sense"".

But then you seem to have a problem with facts, although you make sweeping statements like your version of common sense is backed by facts or that a lot of police work is to enforce taking people's rights. You couldn't even get the facts of this case right. Of course I oppose some laws, but that does not mean I believe all police are scum, that we should have no regard for police death, and regard such lives as lesser value. Society is a real thing, we are not a simplistic collection of individuals.

In the absence of argument, to propose some wild police fantasy as evidence is the realms of la la land and distraction. Hardly factual. Your superiority was unable to pick up on this when mentioned, so cue cheap insult that I was not conversing in English. Have you ever heard of the psychological term projection?

Eeking out answers from you proposes allowing a situation that would make the actual case in hand worse, ie, gun laws.

&gt;We've just been through a housing boom which saw 150k homes being built for the private market every year (according to statistics.gov).

Absolutely, but the population of the UK (by birth and immigration, excluding people who emigrate) increases by around 300,000 individuals a year.

The current rate of completing 'dwellings' is about 150k a year, peaked at 210k a year in 2007 and on average is about 180k a year (according to the OFT's 'Homebuilding in the UK market study from 2008'), those figures include flats (which due to presumed profitability have become a large element of UK building, with not an insignificant number being single occupancy).  There are also a not insignificant number of houses that are not fit for habitation, not to mention that 20k houses are demolished every year.  In terms of demolitions by the way, the current rate is low, probably too low, for comparison, between 1965 and 1971 an average of 81k houses were demolished each year (both according to 'The 40% House project' at the University of Oxford ).

There is an issue of houses being 'in the hands of speculators' but then I would also suggest that quite a few are unfit for habitation, in areas that are economically depressed (you can still buy a house for 12k if you want, but it will be a tiny terrace in a pit village that was decimated by industrial closure...).

So in short, there isn't sufficient housing where people want it, nor is there likely going to be enough housing in areas where people want it in the future (due to supply reductions caused by the recession and land restrictions etc..).

On 23 September 2003 Megrahi applied to the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) to have his conviction investigated.

On 28 June 2007 the SCCRC concluded its four-year review and, having uncovered evidence that a miscarriage of justice could have occurred,  granted Megrahi leave to appeal against his conviction for a second time.

**While that appeal was ongoing Al Megrahi could not be released under the PTA.**

In September 2008 Al Megrahi was rushed to hospital where it was found he had advanced prostate cancer.

On 12 August 2009 Al Megrahi wrote to the High Court in Edinburgh to withdraw his appeal (making his release under the PTA possible).

On 20 August 2009 Kenny MacAskill denied his application for release under the PTA.

The question is embarrassing to whom? Certainly not the current Scottish government.

*""It was a noise I had never heard before but it was a noise that was so painful. My first assumption was it was the noise that was ripping my face off.""*

*Mr Rathband said after a second shot was fired to his shoulder, emergency crews arrived at the scene.*

*He added: ""I asked a paramedic to tell my wife that I loved her and to tell my children that I loved them.*

*""I knew I was going to die.""*

*Northumbria Police have said they would not comment on the story in the newspaper but that Mr Rathband was interviewed as a victim of a crime, not as a police officer.*

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-10633297

Of course you have no sympathy for him though. Poor Raoul Moat. He was only defending his freedom. When I get my gun, my agency is taking out that neighbour I dislike. Their loud music and the balls from the kids in my garden have violated my property rights. If their corpses try to sue I will shoot them again. The courts will back me too because I AM THE LAW! My agency will be sane, competitive, and destroy them. Of course you would agree with this as my views of law may agree with yours. We can't have opposing views of your common sense or ""facts"" can we? Or are rational facts open to the free market now? Maybe scientific facts could also be decided on a local opt in basis? Don't like gravity? Opt out! Don't like evidence? The private market will burn those books. Feeling stupid yet?  It's disgusting everyone should pay for a paramedic for Mr Rathband too.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;This is the first reference I can find to the single occupancy issue, but it was something that was covered somewhat heavily before the crash (as contributing to demand).  


That's interesting, but although that would produce an increase in demand, it's effect on house prices would be offset by the lack of buying power of those individuals. What I mean is, the average house price is 6.4 times the average salary, therefore how many of those single occupants would be able to afford to spend that salary multiple, especially now that credit at that salary multiple has evaporated?  


  
&gt;Absolutely, but the population of the UK (by birth and immigration, excluding people who emigrate) increases by around 300,000 individuals a year.  


That's a very valid point, and one that will eventually have an effect on the price of housing, but it's having a limited effect on current house prices because most new immigrants tend to rent before they buy (if they do buy), but this annual influx of immigrants has not led to greatly increased rental yields. I definitely agree this will have an effect in the coming years as those immigrants who choose to remain in the UK look to buy, as do an increasing number of parents who have growing families that are looking to upsize.  
  
&gt;but then I would also suggest that quite a few are unfit for habitation 


I actually wonder how many in fact are, after years of property porn on TV urging people to buy dilapidated properties in order to 'do them up' for a profit. Personally, that's the type of house I'm looking for as a FTB, and I can't find one that hasn't already been either hacked into flats, or had a lick of paint and some fresh pebbles in the driveway with a nice 100% increase in the property price.
  
&gt;you can still buy a house for 12k if you want, but it will be a tiny terrace in a pit village that was decimated by industrial closure...  
  
That's part of the same problem of income being vastly inadequate compared to property price. A property at 12k is still no use if you don't have 12k to hand and a bank won't lend you the 12k. It might be easier to get a job in more affluent areas, but then the income multiple needed to purchase a house in that area still leaves you out of luck.

&gt;So in short, there isn't sufficient housing where people want it, nor is there likely going to be enough housing in areas where people want it in the future (due to supply reductions caused by the recession and land restrictions etc..). That will push up house prices in areas where people do want them.  


I fully agree. But, like I said, it's all dependant on credit, which has now gone. Ditching self-cert mortgages ('liar loans') is just the next stage of the banks trying to rebalance their books which began with interest rates dropping to nothing and demands for massive deposits. Despite how many vested interests it has in government, the UK property market is not special, it's not invincible. It's subject to the same forces as other markets which have been through correction, the difference with ours was that the crash came just before an election, and since repossessions tend to be bad for votes, they delayed it until it can blow up in the face of the Tories.

true,ajehals,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt; What I mean is, the average house price is 6.4 times the average salary, therefore how many of those single occupants would be able to afford to spend that salary multiple, especially now that credit at that salary multiple has evaporated?

They don't have to buy the houses to impact on demand, they could well rent them.  After all, renting a house at £4/£500/m isn't unheard of in areas where there is decent employment (outside of London where it gets substantially higher..).  That means that those houses are not available to others who might want them or the family/couple that would normally have rented/bought them.  Not to mention that someone with a decent credit history can easily get hold of a mortgage at a 3-5x multiple (even now) which with a salary of 25k (just below average for men) is  sufficient to purchase a house quite easily in places like Sheffield, Leeds and Manchester etc..

&gt;That's a very valid point, and one that will eventually have an effect on the price of housing, but it's having a limited effect on current house prices because most new immigrants tend to rent before they buy (if they do buy), but this annual influx of immigrants has not led to greatly increased rental yields.

Erm, it is having an impact now because building hasn't been keept in line with population growth for a rather long time. I agree that some segment of the market is buy-to-let and some of it is speculation, but I don't think that it is responsible for most of the price increases we have already seen, much of that is people paying a premium for housing that they want.  Of course expectations and so prices have been increased by the availability of cheap credit, largely on the back of low interest rates, but again there is an underlying demand and a supply issue.

&gt;I actually wonder how many in fact are, after years of property porn on TV urging people to buy dilapidated properties in order to 'do them up' for a profit.

There is dilapidated and then there's dilapidated, I can point you at about half a dozen that are fantastic (I made enquiries as to ownership of a few before buying a while back, mainly because they were fantastic houses, but I digress) but not for sale, but would also probably be expensive to repair (re-roof, replacing most of the interior woodwork etc..  In short, houses that are deemed uninhabitable don't tend to simply lack a nice paint job, or some plaster, or even electricity, but rather are unsafe due to some serious deficiency.  

&gt;That's part of the same problem of income being vastly inadequate compared to property price. A property at 12k is still no use if you don't have 12k to hand and a bank won't lend you the 12k. 

A bank would lend most people 12k, even now, especially secured.  The problem is most people don't want, or cannot afford to live where those houses are.
 
&gt;It might be easier to get a job in more affluent areas, but then the income multiple needed to purchase a house in that area still leaves you out of luck.

12k amounts to a 1x multiple at minimum wage, bizarrely the mortgage would be cheaper than renting (take a look at Holyhead for some real out of kilter house prices and rental costs..), the issue there isn't unavailability of credit.

&gt;I fully agree. But, like I said, it's all dependant on credit, which has now gone.

It has been reduced, this has had an impact of reducing house sales, although you will note that there was a mild increase in house prices in some areas over the last two quarters and indeed that even where house prices have fallen, the falls have been less dramatic than rises in period running up to 2007.  In short, a 5% or even 20%/pa drop in house prices isn't that dramatic when compared to 7% per quarter increases... (which were ludicrous of course).

&gt;Ditching self-cert mortgages ('liar loans') is just the next stage of the banks trying to rebalance their books which began with interest rates dropping to nothing and demands for massive deposits.

In part it is, although it is worth noting that the UK had a far stronger regulatory framework than the US did and much of what we see in the US simply doesn't apply in the UK (from foreclosure and bankruptcy rates through to what we in the UK would see as mis-selling).  Yes banks are more cautious about lending and that is putting a crimp on buyers, but if you go to a couple of banks and have a job plus a deposit, you will still easily pick up a mortgage at a 3-5x multiple of your salary (I have a relative doing just that now, his problem is finding a house he likes and can afford).

&gt;Despite how many vested interests it has in government, the UK property market is not special, it's not invincible. It's subject to the same forces as other markets which have been through correction, the difference with ours was that the crash came just before an election, and since repossessions tend to be bad for votes, they delayed it until it can blow up in the face of the Tories.

I disagree, I think that the UK housing market is rather more vulnerable to interest rate hikes than one might want, but it isn't in the dire straights that some have suggested (with it largely being investors, speculators and people claiming inflated incomes buying).  A large swathe of those who own houses both live in them and can afford to pay for them.  That is only likely to change if we start seeing the bank rate up at 15-18% again.

The government should have a policy of encouraging economic development outside the south-east in those areas where these disused houses could be brought back into use, or redeveloped. This should be in the format of industrial development zones and perhaps additional funding to help skilled employees relocate. There should also be strategic development of transport networks to facilitate this.

It doesn't really work like that.

Because we have fiat currency, debt is only really an issue if you make it an issue. The amount of money going in and out of the system is controlled by the Bank of England, and when they inject the money into the system, the money never existed in the first place.

It's exactly the same as when they loan you money to buy a house - they never had that wealth to start with, they just create an IOU for it and then hope you go out into the world and create £200,000 worth of something to pay them back.

Essentially, the debt does not matter. It is a curtain of confusion that has surrounded us for generations. The money doesn't really exist, and neither does the debt, because they never had it in the first place.

The difference is, when you get into debt, as long as you spend the money on decent things, like schools and hospitals, you've done a great thing, because you've turned imaginary wealth into real wealth, things we can see and touch and use.

Now it might be that we can't pay of £5 trillion of money, but think of it this way, who do we owe that money to and what will happen once it's paid back? Where will it go? 

The whole thing is nonsensical from start to end.

Money is just a convenient way of giving people the confidence and motivation to build things. If we start to get all precious about it and tighten our belts, we'll knock our country back 30 years in development.

Sounds like my career plan :P

I would not say it helps the people who treat university as a three year drinking contest.  I think you are more interested in the prospect of graduates, not how graduates pay for their education.

On this we are on agreement.  I definitely think there should be more transparency with degrees.  Too many history of art students, not enough female mathematicians\physicists\comp scis.  What about having the likelihood of getting a job and the salary you will earn at the end of it?  Every application you make will have to more directly state this expected value and the quartiles of their graduates - then everyone at least knows what they are getting into.

Or a meeting with the university careers advice before attending the university?

Hey, why not the amount a graduate earns partly goes to the university you graduated from.  Then universities then have an incentive to create quality and not quantity graduates.

I am with you that we need a more market focussed approach.  My mum used to work at a uni which would oversubscribe students, as they got money from students who dropped out due to hating the course or general lack of drive.  This is a ridiculous quantity over quality practise that probably still happens today.  Anything that tailors our student population to the workplace and the career they want is a good thing.

This is a good idea. The only problem is that it could lead to the closure of science/engineering departments etc. as they are extremely expensive yet the return to those working in technical roles is quite small (City excluded of course :P ) and you would see an explosion of Accounting/Finance degrees but I guess if that is what the market wants...

That is actually a very interesting idea, and although it would be painful at first (like how would you train science researchers?) so long as the salaries for engineers and scientists rose in response then eventually we would have a market-receptive and fair system with less bureaucracy.

What about student maintenance payments though? Surely those must be expensive too, and those tend to seriously effect the lower middle class that are too rich to get government support yet to poor to just pay their way through.

Also, although I personally disagree that the proposed graduate tax would be fairer, you make a good argument :)

On further thought, I think your idea is actually the best solution. One amendment I would suggest would be that a proportion of the graduates salary is paid back to the specific department at the university they graduated from, so if you get a degree in Maths you pay the Maths department etc., this discourages the university from subsidising failing departments. Although it still seems unfair as the more successful maths students would subsidise the less successful, it would give the universities an incentive to increase the number of successful graduates and so hopefully this problem would go away within a few years.",0,1279192639,null,0,true,0,c0ubm5x,t3_cps0i,t1_c0ubm5x,t1_c0ublul,null,1426380576,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Tom Baker was my first, watching on public television back in the eighties, with single episodes running nightly at 11 and whole storylines stitched together to make a movie on Saturdays around noon.

Licensing was different back then, much harder, and when the station ran out of Baker episodes, they went back to Pertwee and started over. I can barely describe, having watched Baker for so long, how much I loathed Pertwee on my first few viewings. But the heart that was there, and still is, won me over, and by the time I saw -my- Doctor fall and die, I greeted Davison with a much more open mind. 

I knew Eccleston was just bait, meant to draw in a new demographic, and wasn't terribly disappointed when he went his predictable way. David Tennant was brilliant, completely unlike Tom Baker (still my archetype,) but brilliant. His regeneration was emotional. 

Matt Smith's first season, in everything I heard leading up to it, scared me. I feared for the sci-fi integrity of the show at every leaked bit of info I heard. 

And I was in serious doubt, still, the first few episodes. By the time the Pandorica opened though, the vision of the new Doctor was complete, and this new ground is fertile, I think. Dunno if Matt Smith will ever replace Tom Baker as my archetypal Doctor, but his quirk factor is right up there, for sure.

Yet the largest economic disaster on record, the Great Depression, and the hardest to hit the working man, occurred under the Gold Standard, and most economists believe the rigidity of the gold standard led to the spread of the depression.  We've enjoyed unprecedented stability in our economies since switching to fiat currency.  What we're experiencing now is *nothing* compared to the GD, or the various other depressions during the 19th century.

&gt; That there isn't enough gold/silver/whatever is a complete nonsense, since whichever is chosen can be (more-or-less) infinitely divided according to how much paper currency is required.

Huh?  Then how is this different to central bankers fiddling with the money supply?

&gt; In a totally free market, gold always wins out and there's a reason for that. The only problem today is that a huge amount of the world's gold has already been secured by the world's plutocrats, so silver might be a more egalitarian choice if we wish to start returning power to working people. But either one would immediately begin to rein in the games by which the people are shafted by the banksters of the world.

Are you American?  Suggesting a return to the gold/silver standard is complete and utter lunacy, and seems to be an American fixation.

At the moment my loan repayments are effectively a tax, they come off my pay slip as a tax. I needed the loan to get my education and now I am taxed until I have repaid it. 

I pay the maximum amount as my parents are pretty well off and I didn't get a grrant. I know other people who have much less to repay as they have parents who are less well off. Effectively we all got the same education, but are being taxed different amounts now based on how much our parents earned at the time when we applied to university. We are also all paying the same amount despite the advantage the degree has given us in terms of earning potential, i.e. a city banker pays the same as a teacher.

Under the new system everyone would go to university without paying fees which is great.

Then, people essentially repay the cost of their education based on their ability to repay it and the benefit (in terms of earnings) that they received from it (not based on how much their parent earned 5 or more years ago)

This is a fairer system in every conceivable way, its not ideal but as long as there is a maximum length the tax applies for (20-25 years seems quite good) and a realistic minimum threshold I can't see a much better option. (Personally I'd also cut student numbers)

Old Doctor Who - You can get a torrent of classic episodes.  A lot of Doctors 1 and 2 are missing, although there are partial reconstructions with full audio tracks available.

Well, I think you're naive to assume that every decision made at government level is based purely upon party interests, regardless of the party in power. 

The mines were gigantic nationalised money holes, leaving them vulnerable to any government that wanted to make cuts. Desire to curtail Union power was not confined to the Tories. The Unions had held the country to ransom repeatedly (and still do, where it comes to the London Underground), costing the nation large sums of money.

In addition, to the extent the gold standard was involved, it wasn't a classical gold standard, and indeed it was the fact fact the Europeans had fled the gold standard to fund WWI and then tried to return to it on pre-war levels having hopelessly inflated their currencies.  Also, most joe-public economists these days are neo-Keynesians (aka - wrong on so many points), professional and academic economists have in large part changed their views considerably.

[For example](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/GreatDepression.html): ""One of the most coherent explanations, which pulls together several of these themes, is what economic historian Robert Higgs calls “regime uncertainty.” According to Higgs, Roosevelt’s New Deal led business leaders to question whether the current “regime” of private property rights in their firms’ capital and its income stream would be protected. They became less willing, therefore, to invest in assets with long lives. Roosevelt had first suspended the antitrust  laws so that American businesses would cooperate in government-instigated cartels; he then switched to using the antitrust laws to prosecute firms for cooperating. New taxes had been imposed, and some were then removed; increasing regulation  of businesses had reduced businesses’ ability to act independently and raise capital; and new legislation had reduced their freedom in hiring and employing labor.""

The dollar has lost more than 95% of its value is less than a century, and many other fiat currencies have been devalued to nought, that's hardly stability!

On how it's different to have gold valued at whatever amount of currency is needed _at the outset_ from the situation now, well I'm frankly surprised that a non-neophyte economist would need this spelt out.  The point is that it can't be inflated, the amount of gold is flexibly divisible but limited and grows at a predictable rate.

But what is a ""classical gold standard"", and in what respect were the major currencies in the early twentieth centuries not ""classical"" gold standard?

&gt; Also, most joe-public economists these days are neo-Keynesians (aka - wrong on so many points), professional and academic economists have in large part changed their views considerably.

Neo-Keynesians?  I suppose so, in the sense that Keynes theory is now part and parcel of mainstream economics.  And, with all due respect, Robert Higgs and various other Austrians are not part of mainstream economic thought.

And?

&gt; On how it's different to have gold valued at whatever amount of currency is needed at the outset from the situation now, well I'm frankly surprised that a non-neophyte economist would need this spelt out. The point is that it can't be inflated, the amount of gold is flexibly divisible but limited and grows at a predictable rate.

But the fact that the gold supply *cannot* be inflated is part and parcel of the problem with the Gold Standard!  Sometimes it is useful to inflate your currency, and this is precisely why the GS was abandoned in the first place.

Yes of course, but the gold standard is not generally blamed for causing the _onset_ of the depression, but merely for extending it in countries which stuck with it.

&gt; But what is a ""classical gold standard"", and in what respect were the major currencies in the early twentieth centuries not ""classical"" gold standard?

It's in the blog article I linked to: ""To be technical does the government run a fractional reserve gold standard or a 100% reserve gold standard. In layman’s terms if the government promises to give an ounce of gold for every thousand dollars does it have gold to pay out one thousandth of an ounce of gold for every dollar in circulation

If it doesn’t have the gold to pay off all its obligations then it is operating a fractional reserve system which is indeed vulnerable to attacks by speculators. This is because the value of the gold the government is willing to pay for its notes is greater than the value of the notes. The government in such a situation is in fact systemically bankrupt, it does not have the gold to meet its obligations and it has no prospect of getting enough gold to pay off its obligations. That such a system is highly unstable goes without saying. The government or other issuer under such a system is in the same position as the government of Argentina under its dollar peg.""

Well, yes.  But I don't see your point.  Nobody claimed that the GS caused the Great Depression, merely prolonged it and caused it to spread as widely as it did.  As I said, being able to manipulate the money supply is *vital* to a stable economy.  We saw it in the GD, and we're seeing it now in this latest recession.

Keynesianism has been absorbed into mainstream economic thought.  It is simply no longer disputed by anybody that the massive government spending in the US as they entered WW2 led to the end of the Great Depression.  You simply *cannot* explain why we came out of the Great Depression without some element of Keynesianism.  Austrians love to make out that Keynesianism is some sort of voodoo economics (that, naturally, would be Austrianism itself), but it just isn't.

There have been many exceptions to this rule, many summarized well in [this website](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord#Regeneration)

""It was first stated in The Deadly Assassin[20]  that a Time Lord can regenerate twelve times before dying (thirteen incarnations in all). There were exceptions to this rule, however: when the Master reached the end of his regenerative cycle, he took possession of the body of another person to continue living. The Master was also offered a new cycle of regenerations by the High Council to save the Doctor from the Death Zone, which may indicate that there are methods to circumvent the 12 regeneration limit. The Master says in ""The Sound of Drums"" that the Time Lords ""resurrected"" him to fight in the Time War, which appears to support this. It was revealed in ""The Brain of Morbius"" that the Time Lords also use the Elixir of Life in extreme cases, where regeneration is not possible. This may be the reason for additional regeneration cycles being granted.

Also in The Deadly Assassin, several Time Lords including the President are stated to have been ""murdered"" and are not stated to have regenerated. Although it is possible that all of the Time Lords killed were at the end of their regeneration cycles (somewhat more likely with a retiring President: potentially his reaching the end of his regeneration cycle was the very reason for his retirement), it is also possible that regeneration, regardless of how many regenerations the individual Time Lord has already undergone, is a conditional and non-inevitable phenomenon. This is stated in The End of Time when the Doctor explains to Wilfred Mott that a Time Lord can die before they have a chance to regenerate, in which case they die outright. In The Deadly Assassin at least one of the murders was carried out with a 'staser', possibly a weapon designed to both kill and prevent regeneration (stasers are also stated to have little effect on non-living tissue).[20] Some victims, such as Runcible, were possibly ""just Gallifreyans"" and not Time Lords (see above), and so may not have had the ability to regenerate.""",0,1279300370,null,0,false,0,c0ufi1j,t3_cq964,t1_c0ufi1j,t1_c0ufgr9,null,1426382408,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

There are other problems with the TV movie; for instance, what the Eye of Harmony was doing there, and why in the world it would only be opened with a human eye.  Other books try to explain these facts, and the book Lungbarrow helps bridge the gap between the last year of the Seventh Doctor and the movie, but it is also quite controversial and not considered cannon.

Given everything else we know about The Doctor, he cannot be half-human, especially not on his mother's side, since we saw his mother as Gallifreyan.  One could construct an elaborate semi-explanation involving genetics and changed forms but either invoking a Chameleon Arch or simply saying the Eight Doctor lied (Rule #1) is a lot simpler.

When I questioned him further he told me he believed in the ideology of the NHS, care free at the point of use and it was a major accomplishment but allocation of resources was criminal and if the general population knew of the level of wastage in the system then there would be riots.

The symptom was that waiting lists were growing too long. So, to shorten the lists, the labour government paid consultants huge premiums to encourage them to work out of hours, perform extra procedures etc. This has brought the waiting lists down, albeit at great cost. But there is now a new problem. Very little of the money was allocated towards increasing the actual structural capacity of the NHS. Instead of increasing capacity, the measures the labour government took stretched it to its limits. Instead of paying 3 consultants a base fee, they paid one an extortionate amount to do the work of 3. There was a tiny amount of future investment in terms of staffing.

Waiting lists are beginning to creep up again, and this doctor believes that they are only going to get worse. He said that it would not be so bad if it was the doctors allocating the resources, spending the money on a case by case basis, but doctors have been stripped of their independence by targets and NHS managers, which has resulted in patients being denied a treatment because it is too expensive or it cannot be budgeted for. Doctors were not trusted to use their best judgement, and are now trapped in reams of needless paper work, surrounded by the stricture of politics beyond their control.

The thing was, it was not just this doctor that held this opinion. Every other doctor, nurse or technician I spoke to agreed the same: that the NHS is bloated with managers and targets resulting in an increasingly detrimental service. With the sheer amount of learning and skill needed to be a doctor, you should not be paying doctors to chase patients to sign consent forms, to shuffle paperwork or mess with IT.

In the master used energy from the eye of harmony to gain a little extra life due to wearing the sash of rassilon, and he took over Tremas (anthony ainley) in The Keeper of Traken using power of the keepership. This was not a new regeneration. It was just a tactic to extend his current remaining life. 

In being offered a new set of lives to rescue the doctor from the death zone, I always took this to mean, we'll physically give you a new body with and keep your mind intact, and thus have 13 new lives. They weren't just being nice and ""granting"" him the ability to keep regenerating. 

I always took ""ressurected"" to mean they used his bio-data extract to essentially create a clone of the master, in which case he probably started off at his first life and had 12 ""new"" regenerations. 

I never understood the idea that not all galifreyans are time lords. Any link as to were that is suggested? I would imagine that Runcible is indeed a time lord, as he was at the prydonian academy with the Doctor. I think he just got killed outright. I mean if you cut the doctor's head off, he wouldn't regenerate. I believe there is an episode, can't remember which, where the doctor explains that he can't be too seriously injured to regenerate. 

The new series has already screwed up the concept, by letting tenant ""regenerate"" after getting shot by the dalek, but not actually changing bodies, so who knows.

I for one had to get out of the place and meet some people that weren't a) white, b) racist, c) homophobic, d) contemptuous of anyone who doesn't conform. I got a lot of shit when I lived there, because I didn't fit in with any of their 'norms'. And the last time I visited, I got nasty abuse in the street from a bunch of drunken lads just because I was wearing a vintage coat and looking different (i.e. not like a cheap slag). I also had to sit and listen to my friends spout racist nonsense about immigrants (a night which ended in me shooting down all the crazy theories using the information I gleaned while doing research on race relations in my (highly diverse) local area.)

There's also a good reason why many people I know didn't come out until they left they bay. Namely, their lives would've been made a misery if it/they had come out.

If Torbay wants to turn itself around, it needs to inject more youth and culture in. There needs to be something in the museums and galleries other than fucking landscapes and seascapes. There needs to be a college/small university or something which attracts youthful, intelligent, broad-minded people, something to counteract the horrible chain bar culture (Do you remember the Piazza? That place was so much fun!) and the blinkered thinking that goes with it. There needs to be something more than mindrotting Gemini to listen to, and more diversity when it comes to live bands, theatre, etc. 

Also, there needs to be more affordable housing, and all these 'weekend home' types from London need to fuck off. If I'm not mistaken, people are being priced out of the places they grew up in because of these folks. And don't you guys miss out on valuable council tax because of them?

Sometimes I dream about going back to live in the bay. I miss the beaches so much. I miss swimming in the sea. I don't miss the small-mindedness, or the abuse, or any of the other bollocks that made me want to die inside when I lived there.

true,sirbruce,null,null,"You're right, he did say that.  But it's not true (the Doctor lies).  He does age (remember what The Master did to him), just much more slowly than humans.  We're talking individual body age, here.  This is not retained across regenerations; the new bodies have a new ""age"" (generally considered to be the actor's age).  The trend over time has been to increasingly younger doctors, although this is partly influenced by the fact that the first time we see the Hartnell Doctor he's already ""old"".

&gt; If he did age within a regeneration, then shouldn't he regenerate into a child, so he could have the longest lifespan possible?

Time Lords usually have limited control over their regenerations and usually can't choose their form.  The most control we've ever seen over regeneration was Romana (she was actually able to ""try on"" different forms before deciding on one she wanted), but this may have been because she chose to regenerate after her previous form was injured (presumably terminal, but not immediately so).  She also had access to the TARDIS' Zero Room, which helps with regeneration; sadly, The Doctor lost his Zero Room in *Castrovolva*, although in the books he had a new one constructed.  It could be that The Doctor is just bad with regeneration, or perhaps he likes not knowing.

Edit: The Second Doctor was also given a choice of bodies when his regeneration was forced on him by the Time Lords, though he did not pick one.

The style and quality of writing has changed somewhat since the old series. Now, like so many other shows, logic can sometimes go out the window in favour of cutesy writing. Quickest examples in that episode alone? The Doctor's escape from the Pandorica, Amelia's thirst, his shot-self's message to the twelve-minute-earlier-self... these were all examples of *paradox*.

With multiple parallel future universes, time paradoxes stop being paradoxes and can be possible. *Without* parallel future universes - the very ones Doctor sealed off, the ones the Time Lords managed, the ones Russell Davies got rid of and Moffat had to make into a single, changeable universe - paradoxes are flat-out-impossibilities.

But the writer threw one in because there was no other way for the Doctor to be rescued; and another because he wanted a cutesy five-second throwaway laugh.

I miss Tom Baker's nods to science. I miss Davison's ethical dilemmas. I miss McCoy's majesty. I miss Pertwee's elegance and action. I miss Troughton's unassuming comic-hidden power. I miss Colin Baker's bombastic fallibility. I miss Hartnell's arrogance developed into a love for the human species. I miss the imagination that went into McGann's novelised adversaries.

I also miss the fact that the universe **didn't get destroyed every year**. I mean... *Terminus* risked a new Big Bang. *Logopolis* destroyed a **part** of the universe. *The Three Doctors* **risked** draining the power of the Time Lords and a catastrophic anti-matter explosion.

Eccleston, Tennant and Smith have many positive features. Beautiful additions to much of the canon. But their writers threw out of a lot of baby in their urge to throw out still valuable bathwater. And replaced it with over-fluorided content, because that's what **a lot of other shows** are doing too.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;They don't have to buy the houses to impact on demand, they could well rent them. After all, renting a house at £4/£500/m isn't unheard of in areas where there is decent employment (outside of London where it gets substantially higher..). That means that those houses are not available to others who might want them or the family/couple that would normally have rented/bought them. 
  
Yes, they could rent them. But the number of properties up for rent is skyrocketing due to houses being taken off the market that didn't sell, and instead being put up for rent. With such an influx of properties up for rent, people can afford to be picky and rents will not be increasing. This situation will work for some forced landlords who are not overstretched, but many are and probably won't get the rental yeilds that will make it a viable option long term.  
  
&gt;Not to mention that someone with a decent credit history can easily get hold of a mortgage at a 3-5x multiple (even now) which with a salary of 25k (just below average for men) is sufficient to purchase a house quite easily in places like Sheffield, Leeds and Manchester etc..   
  
Yes there are mortgages available, but as I've said before, there is a sizeable number of people who either have bad credit history, or too small a deposit to be able to get approval. Plus those areas you have listed are quite dependant on the public sector and will be hard hit when cuts are made.

&gt;Erm, it is having an impact now because building hasn't been keept in line with population growth for a rather long time. I agree that some segment of the market is buy-to-let and some of it is speculation, but I don't think that it is responsible for most of the price increases we have already seen, much of that is people paying a premium for housing that they want. Of course expectations and so prices have been increased by the availability of cheap credit, largely on the back of low interest rates, but again there is an underlying demand and a supply issue.  
  
As I've said before, and I think we partly agree on this, that the supply and demand problem is one of suitable housing rather than volume of housing available. Much of the housing built in the past 10 years has been of generally poor standard, new-builds, flat conversions etc. Access to cheap credit meant that people were able to 'afford' these, which had the effect of pushing up prices of more decent housing. Now that the credit honeymoon is over, prices will crash. It won't happen all in one go though, first the new-build flats will drop, then new build houses, and then your average Victorian terrace. Whatever way the pain happens, it will still happen.

&gt;There is dilapidated and then there's dilapidated, I can point you at about half a dozen that are fantastic (I made enquiries as to ownership of a few before buying a while back, mainly because they were fantastic houses, but I digress) but not for sale, but would also probably be expensive to repair (re-roof, replacing most of the interior woodwork etc.. In short, houses that are deemed uninhabitable don't tend to simply lack a nice paint job, or some plaster, or even electricity, but rather are unsafe due to some serious deficiency. 
 
We can both pull out experiences that may match, or contradict each other, but it still remains that those dilapidated properties have decreased in number over the past decade which would have been prime stock for a first time buyer looking to get onto the property ladder.  
  
&gt;A bank would lend most people 12k, even now, especially secured. The problem is most people don't want, or cannot afford to live where those houses are.
  
If they can't afford to live where those houses are, then they can't afford to service the debt on that 12k. If they can't afford to service that debt, then a bank won't lend to them. Which certainly contrasts to the past decade thankfully.

&gt;It has been reduced, this has had an impact of reducing house sales, although you will note that there was a mild increase in house prices in some areas over the last two quarters and indeed that even where house prices have fallen, the falls have been less dramatic than rises in period running up to 2007. In short, a 5% or even 20%/pa drop in house prices isn't that dramatic when compared to 7% per quarter increases... (which were ludicrous of course).  

I agree, but that came at the same time as much government interference to avoid repossessions, and a drastic drop in the interest rate which now has only has one way to go.  
  
&gt;In part it is, although it is worth noting that the UK had a far stronger regulatory framework than the US did and much of what we see in the US simply doesn't apply in the UK (from foreclosure and bankruptcy rates through to what we in the UK would see as mis-selling). Yes banks are more cautious about lending and that is putting a crimp on buyers, but if you go to a couple of banks and have a job plus a deposit, you will still easily pick up a mortgage at a 3-5x multiple of your salary (I have a relative doing just that now, his problem is finding a house he likes and can afford).

I fully agree there's a massive difference between regulation in the UK and the US (thankfully!), but Ireland has similar regulation to us, but went through a massive correction (admittedly it had a bigger bubble, but my point still stands). I think this comes down to how optimistic we are about the current state of the economy. Your relative is fortunate in that he has a job, a deposit and a good credit rating. I'm not optimistic that there are enough people in the current housing market with those 3 characteristics to sustain current prices.  
  
&gt;I disagree, I think that the UK housing market is rather more vulnerable to interest rate hikes than one might want, but it isn't in the dire straights that some have suggested (with it largely being investors, speculators and people claiming inflated incomes buying).

&gt; He's fire and ice and rage.  He's ancient and forever.  He burns at the center of time and he can see the turn of the universe.

about a goofball like 10?  He didn't!

Have it set during the time war.  Paul McGann takes up the role, and amasses an army of regular people, who he fashions into weapons the likes of which we have never seen before.  Every week we'd get to see a new suicide-bomber-with-a-doomsday-weapon, going on his adventure with the Doctor, and then forced to take out a major Dalek installation, killing millions on both sides.  

This could be anything from epic space battles, to virologists with terrible plagues, and the Doctor makes it happen whether they do it voluntarily or not.  The Doctor openly manipulates his companions, and treats them more like pets than even #10 did.  

You could follow the development of McGann's Doctor from the generic american scifi hero guy into something monstrous, inch by inch, week by week, for the sake of winning against someone almost as bad as he becomes.

Make the Doctor into a terrifying protagonist, who lives long enough to see the horrors he's created destroy great and beautiful things in the name of the higher purpose.  Show the Doctor the true face of his favourite species.  

When it's all over, just leave off where Eccleston picks up, with the man who can't trust himself or anyone else, and hating humanity and it's abject stupidity.

Edit: Also, to get past how idiotic Daleks will look to American audiences, just make sure you never see a whole Dalek on camera.  Close-up shots of chrome and lasers, with those horrible voices, steam everywhere, and a path of destruction in their wake.  Americans are, at least, afraid of flying saucers if they're done right, so you can show their ships.",0,1279487855,null,0,true,0,c0ukwgo,t3_cqyik,t1_c0ukwgo,t3_cqyik,null,1426384945,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

They stopped and started whispering together, and then I heard someone come closer and felt a hand touch the 'stone' of my dress. I instantly spun around into 'attack' mode, whereupon the pretty woman who had been touching my dress let out a shriek and jumped back about ten feet. She and the man started laughing uproariously, and the man said that she was absolutely terrified by that episode would probably have nightmares now. They asked if I could pose with her for a picture like I was attacking her. I said sure and posed. They shouted, ""Strangle her! Strangle me!"", so I did.

In practice it is an awful idea as we've seen in the past decade or so. Consensus is what robs the public of its voice and power. Politicians agreeing is the one real threat to democracy that has become apparent in recent years.

We was VERY unlucky not to grab a late equaliser when a lovely floating cross provided us with a one-on-one chance, but the keeper saved the first shot well and the rebound (which beat the keeper) was cleverly blocked on the line by their defender.

Ontop of this every time you get promoted, all of a sudden your star players will probably be mediocre in the new league and you will once again have to work out how you can sign/loan players of suitable quality without going massively into debt.

 * Use the ""Load all players from"" feature when you setup the game. Including the players from a country like Portugal will give you a lot of cheap players to choose from

 * Keep the player flow high. You need to sell your expensive players when given the chance in order to have enough money for more talented players with lower reputation for the future and to have enough money to increase salaries over time so you can get better players

That's a ridiculous jump. Governments already demonise smokers, and probably call people who smoke 'stupid', but at no point is the government going to round them up and shoot them - that's really not a logical extrapolation.

&gt;A government which thinks it can opine on or interfere with subjects that are none of its business.

Smoking is a good example of this actually. Smoking is banned in pubs and in public places, work places, etc - this is because it is harmful not only to those who do it, but to those around them. You can draw parallels with religion in that respect, and in fact I think religion should be treated exactly the same as smoking.

Just like cigarettes, religious texts should come with a warning on the front warning users of the dangers of such things, much like that [old internet picture](http://sciencenotes.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/holy-bible-warning.jpg).",0,1279637038,null,0,false,0,c0upqai,t3_crj5c,t1_c0upqai,t1_c0upoky,null,1426387229,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Actually it was an analogy.  You don't advocate this because although some things (like religion) are bad or annoying, sometimes the cure is worse than the illness.

The government interfering in people's lives unnecessarily is an evil, and *in spite* of the fact people sometimes live their lives poorly (don't exercise, smoke, eat junk foot, believe religions, etc) you *really* don't want to set the precedent of the government interfering because it thinks it knows best.

&gt; Governments already demonise smokers, and probably call people who smoke 'stupid'

Fair point... but do you think that's a *good* thing, or part of the same trend I was criticising?

(Hint: What happens in -say - ten years' time when someone votes a staunch Roman Catholic cabinet in, and the government decides homosexuality, abortion or premarital sex are ""bad"" for you?)

&gt; Smoking is a good example of this actually... I think religion should be treated exactly the same as smoking.

It's an interesting point, but frankly I'd rather get away from thei invasive, interfering, eminently corruptible ""Father Knows Best"" style of governing, and back towards valuing personal freedom (*even where* people use those freedoms to do or believe stupid things).

Once you give a government power, it rarely gives it up short of a revolution or regime change.  And while today an invasive, interfering, opinionated government might be taxing churches and calling religious people stupid (yay!), in a decade's time we could be imprisoning atheists and indoctrinating our kids with Scientology gibberish in schools, *and you won't have a leg to stand on to object*. :-(",0,1279638414,null,0,false,0,c0upsf2,t3_crj5c,t1_c0upsf2,t1_c0upqai,null,1426387255,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

You're implying that if Sherlock Holmes was transported into the future, say via a TARDIS related incident, he would be unable to compete with modern, refined forensics and CSI professionals when trying to solve a murder/conspiracy/mystery? 

While I agree with the sentiment that Sherlock was a shining beacon of hope and Justice amidst a sea of opium addled, ineffectual Detective Inspectors, I don't believe that fact is essential or even relevant to Sherlock or his characteristics. 

Sherlock is about detail. Reason. Logic. And above all else, he is about getting to the bottom of things regardless of who stands in his way, be it fiends or the Law itself. If anything, the conflict of working within the rule of law and doing what needs to be done is more pronounced in a modern setting.

Your chances of signing a player drastically improve if you have a positive relationship with them, the positive commentary may also influence to move to a team where they feel they are appreciated more.

A very slow start saw us two down after 15 minutes. Poor marking from a free kick for the first, and a quickly taken free kick for the second when someone should have been really stood on the ball whilst Meridith organised his wall. 

Played okay for the rest of the second half, Fitzpatrick and Quaynor standing out. Agger, Cornes,Walters and Sheppell though all posing question marks over whether they can make any kind of an impact in the Conference North next season. 

Various substitutions during the second half, most of which improved things. Benji came on for Adaggio (who didn't look 100%) and scored two well taken goals. Danny Campbell and Dan Carter took up wide positions in the midfield and caused problems with their pace. Nathan Jukes moved from right back into the middle of the park and looked far more accomplished than anyone else who has played in midfield so far this pre season. They scored a good third with probably their only shot on goal. 

Trying to remain positive. I think the defence is sound, Spencer and Jones both had decent games and their partnership will get better and better. Up front for the first time in a long time we have options in Benji, Adaggio, Campbell, Carter and Ravenhill. Midfield is a massive worry though. Fitzpatrick will do a job and is in a similar mould to Jack Byrne, and as previously mentioned Jukes looked okay, but that is it. With such a young squad we are crying out for a Palmer/Downes type of player, a ball winner with an old head to organise things on the park. Sheppell may have been given this job but he isn't good enough.

Tennant?   Well, the thing is, most people who love Tennant, that I've talked to, never saw the ""pre-Eccleston"" Who.  And really never ""caught"" much of the Eccleston Who.   So to them, Tennant was -their- doctor, and how the character Should Be.    People fear change.

They are very misguided, and pretty pathetic in their views, but they aren't evil.  They are just trying to help people, as horribly misguided as their ""help"" might be.

The Borg are basically evil, they are a virus.  The Cybermen aren't the virus of the Borg, they are too pathetic to be a virus.  Just look at how successful they are in their goals.  They Cybermen lose.  They lose time and time again.

The day in court is basicly a formality to aprove the record created by that due process. Objecting at this point is futile.

First thing to do in situatoins like this is to go on the record, fill the case with relavant facts and demand substantive evidence for any facts the council rely upon. That is to say file your case with a notary and have them service the court, the council and the crown before the date of court. There in creating a superior record.

By waiting until the last minute your inaction is creating a situation where the council is already past the post, they've won because you let them, not because they're right.

Winning in a case like this is about levying the application to the court substantially, make it such that if there is no written surety of a fact, signed and sealed, then it's understood it's a falsehood. Otherwise spoken words in the court room are just deception, on the respondant, the court and the crown, via the magistrates.

I'm not quite sure how far beyond the Ninth Doctor that sentiment extends, though. I know previous Doctors have typically had more than one Companion at a time, but whether or not those Companions had interaction with friends and family is quite unknown to me. I haven't seen enough of the old series to make a judgment on that account.

However, it is certainly true, every Companion in the new series (Rose, Martha, Donna) had interaction with people outside of the TARDIS from their regular lives. But I don't think that's necessary for character development nor do I think it actually helps anything.

Amy had no one besides Rory, and he was brought on as a Companion halfway through the series. Of course, he only lasted three episodes before he was killed, but even the death helped his and Amy's character development. Even when Amy couldn't remember him, she was still crying over him, and that expressed how she truly felt about him.

So I don't think that interaction with people (friends/family) outside of the TARDIS really matters at all. We have exactly what we need to see the development of the characters.

Dear MP,

I saw Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt threatening to cut the BBC’s licence fee this weekend. The BBC isn’t perfect (yet), but it’s worth protecting, and it is a shining example for TV worldwide. It is worth every penny of the licence fee. The BBC is something that every Briton should be proud of, and internationals envious of, it excels in reporting, drama, documentaries, radio, TV, entertainment. It is innovative and creative with iPlayer.

I love their TV dramas, investigative reporting, politics shows, comedy on both TV and radio.

To cut these services would do a great disservice to the unbiased media and reporting within this country. Something which is important within this modern society where the news media can manipulate what the public hears about and believes so easily. The public needs unbiased news, both local and global, and the BBC provides this.

I’m worried this government may be putting ideology and the interests of rival media barons like Rupert Murdoch before the interests of ordinary listeners and viewers. The BBC serves us, he serves himself.

Please will you:
1. Raise my concerns with Jeremy Hunt and tell him I don’t want cuts forced on the BBC.
2. Tell me what you’ll do as my MP to stand up for the BBC and protect it from cuts.

Thank you,   
animorph

**The reply:**

Dear animorph,

Thank you for taking the time to contact me regarding the future of the BBC. The Government fully supports the BBC and wants it to remain the cornerstone of UK public service broadcasting. I know that my colleague Jeremy Hunt MP, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has described the BBC as a “huge national crown jewel” and is committed to sustaining the BBC’s position as the nation’s standard-setting public service broadcaster.

However, I also strongly believe that the BBC can and should be doing more to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.  To this end, the Government will give the National Audit Office full access to the BBC’s accounts to ensure transparency.  I believe that this move will make the Government work harder to achieve value for money.

As Jeremy has also made clear, the Government will be discussing the future of BBC funding with the Corporation in detail during the licence fee settlement and BBC Charter Renewal.  One of the issues that the Government has made clear needs to be addressed is the lack of transparency surrounding pay for top executives and highly paid stars.

I also think that in the long term the BBC’s governance structures need reforming. The Government is not convinced that, in the long-term, the current BBC Trust represents the best model. I believe that it would be better for there to be a genuinely independent regulator of the BBC that ensures licence fee payers’ interests are best heard.


Thank you once again for writing.

**My further reply:**

Dear MP,

Thank you for your reply to my email. However, I have a few further responses to it:

&gt;""One of the issues that the Government has made clear needs to be addressed is the lack of transparency surrounding pay for top executives and highly paid stars.""

This I can agree with. However, I do not see why the government is making it its business.

&gt;""I believe that this move will make the Government work harder to achieve value for money.""

Again, why is the government making this its business? The BBC is funded by the licence fee, whilst admittedly set by the government, they have no place in dictating this ""value for money"". The BBC has no place in the current need to save money and recover from the national debt. It is a separate tax from others.

&gt;""I also think that in the long term the BBC’s governance structures need reforming. The Government is not convinced that, in the long-term, the current BBC Trust represents the best model.""

This I cannot agree with. **You** believe? Well **I** believe that the BBC Trust does represent the best model, they seek advice from viewership and listen and adhere to the majority of views that they receive. Every time I have contacted the BBC or the BBC Trust I have felt my views were listened to and acknowledged.

Another independent regulator is asking for excessive red tape shackling the BBC's creativity and risk taking. There is the BBC Trust and Ofcom available, and not only that but Points Of View offers a broadcasted forum for views and opinions.

I appreciate that your duty requires you to represent the majority of views in our constituency, and not your own. Thank you for replying to my e-mail promptly, it is reassuring to know that my views are being sincerely acknowledged.

Thank you for your time,

I did not like the Weeping Angels two-party, which trashed a good monster, but I thought the Pandorica two-part finale was much better than last season's two-part finale The Stolen Earth, maybe even better than the End of Time, and in some ways better than The Master's reintroduction as well (remember super-old Gollum doctor?

Mark Gatiss seems to write some of the worst episodes (The Unquiet Dead, The Idiot's Lantern, Victory of the Daleks) but perhaps he simply doesn't have a knack for television scripts considering all of his other diverse work.

true,Judy-Lee,tennant,Tennant,"I don't find the quality of the writing to be much different - its the choices the writers have made, or to be fair it may be directorial choices, which made this season feel less connected.

The advent of the 9th Doctor saw a far greater emotional quotient than we had ever had with the Doctor previously, is this case grief, anger, a certain longing to be grounded after such disassociation. This flowed smoothly into the story arc of redemption through love which meant the 10th Doctor was even yet more emotionally reachable for the audience. Tennant's performance and the directors' willingness to use his ability to emote without dialogue was used to brilliant effect so the audience watched the play of feelings across the characters face and just went ""Oh I know how that feels"" and instantly connected to the character. A prime example was The Runaway Bride when at the last Donna asks him the name of the woman he lost and although his response is limited (""Rose, her name was Rose."") The directorial choice made for it to be an emotional transition from enthused and happy by the days events to grieving as he remembers was a powerful one. The same dialogue could have simply been factual, or even done as a courtesy (Lesson learned from never mentioning Sarah Jane). I think in the fifth season that's what we would have got. The 11th Doctor by and large is far more akin to his Classic Who roots, than his 2 most direct predecessors. 

While I have loved the 9th and 10th Doctors there was little left they could do on the love, requited and otherwise front, that didn't risk damaging canon, and therefore the longevity of the show. Poor Matt Smith was always going to be pushing it uphill to have the viewers love him, certainly in his first season, and I think he has done well. Going forward I hope we will see a clearer character arc for the Doctor as well as his companions. That is my only criticism of the writing of season five, the set pieces and long terms mysteries are in play and very engaging, the companions and guest stars an intriguing and developing but the Doctor is just the Doctor, the same 11th Doctor as he was when he regenerated, he has yet to begin a character evolution. Most likely so Matt and the audience could acclimatise to him as Who in the first place, in which case, fair enough.

There are those who say that this is a good thing. You have to pay £11 a month for the BBC if you own a TV. Proving you don't own a TV is very difficult. See a post about this further down the thread. This annoys a lot of people but not me personally.

Then there are those who say a Conservative Government supported and in part financed by Rupert Murdoch (Fox News, The Time, Sky) cannot possibly be impartial in deciding the fate of the BBC when they are actively supported by it's biggest opponent.

The BBC is an independent organisation managed by a Trust. How can a news organisation deliver reasonably balanced news or criticism of a government if it is constantly looking over it's shoulder? IMO this government is out to get the BBC. US Redditors are often complaining about how US commercial news organisations lack impartiality. As a British person, the difference between the tone and content of the output between the BBC and Sky News or Fox News is often staggering. 

In my view, you can argue if the BBC tells the truth, however, it's hard to argue that it doesn't present both sides of an argument with reasonable impartiality. This is a rare thing that needs to be protected.

Timey-wimey is shorthand for the following: Look, yes, there are many plot holes but in the end it was great fun to watch. I had fun. Doctor Who is not hard sci-fi. It is a show that *through canon* revels in the fact that it has a loose reality and a loose continuity.

When someone says to you ""if the plot holes filled with silly putty bother you too much, then you should probably move on,"" they aren't telling you ""love it or leave it."" It just doesn't make sense to subject oneself to something one thinks is bad.

* Season 1's finale was the definition of *deus ex machina.*
* Season 2's finale was over-emotional tripe.
* Season 3's finale was a bloody paradox thrown right in your face.
* Season 4's finale didn't make any sense.
* Season 5's finale was a whole mess of paradoxes.

But we enjoyed them even when they didn't precisely make sense. And that's why we keep watching. Not because we trick ourselves into thinking these issues don't exist, but because these issues don't hamper our enjoyment of the show. So when someone tells you ""dude...maybe you shouldn't be watching it,"" they aren't telling you ""love it or leave it."" They're telling you that maybe if your enjoyment of it is being hampered by the issues, then maybe you should watch something else.

Someone else mentioned that Doctor Who is akin to MST3K. I wouldn't go that far, but the sentiment is clear. Doctor Who is *not* hard sci-fi. It's the near definition of loose sci-fi. It's fun.

Plenty of other channels manage without having to skank its customers out of money, what the BBC does is provide a massive range of services and programs, most of which just don't revolve around, or are relevant, to me.

I can reconcile this claim because I do not think it is currently either state run or private and it needs desperately to be one or the other and my preference is, that while it seeks to make me pay for it and makes a profit and pays disgusting levels of wages to people who really do not deserve it while others sit in poverty, it should sit firmly in the private sector.

If I recognise a plothole, I'll laugh, point it out, wish they hadn't done it, but then move on.

I did not think Victory of the Daleks was that good an episode. So I'll say: lordy, that Bracewell bomb thing was stupid, wasn't it? And then move on, because I don't expect perfect solutions every time. I'll be disappointed that it was a bit hamfisted, but then appreciate those times where everything is perfect.

There are always going to be good and bad things, but criticism does not always have to be approached negatively, which is what you seem to do. And it's annoying. So yes, it does lead people like me to wonder if you enjoy the show at all.

Catch up on what? There is *nothing* worth watching on TV. And in the event I do want to see a show, I head into London for the stage with my wife and we spend quality time together, we end up talking about the show for days - that is a show.

I have actual hobbies and interests; I  love gardening - my wife and I, grow most of our own food, exercising, cooking, and educating myself. Life is just way to short and interesting to waste it sitting in front of the TV.

I am very serious, I get much, much more out of a book and the outdoors than I could ever get watching the TV. 

Hell, even the internet has become a time and money sync that I can do without, just to much noise and not enough signal - like the TV; and I am seriously considering getting rid of this as well.

true,Tezcatlan,null,null,"&gt;The figures show that 18 per cent of girls who said they were sexually active had been pregnant by the age of 18.

It's a fifth of sexually active girls get pregnant. That's probably 18% of  a figure smaller than the percentage of males and females who are sexually active before 18, which is 83%.

If we take 100 boys and 100 girls and assume both males and females have similar pre-18 sexual experiences (probably unjustified), then we have 83 sexually active boys and 83 sexually active girls. Of those girls, 18 will get pregnant. This is effectively a pregnancy scare, which can become a real baby. Perhaps they keeping it in a loving relationship, perhaps on their own, perhaps having the morning after pill or an abortion.  

Anyways; Of those 18 girls, 15 of those just have one pregnancy 'scare' or event.


This means out of 100 teenage girls (including all those who are entirely legally entitled to marry and start families), there are only 3 girls who have either more than one baby or more than one abortion.

Red (Home) No.5 Shirt. Given to me by Mark (?) Creighton at end of 2006/07 season I think. He then made an upward move to Kidderminster Harriers. Not sure where he is at the moment.

Bear in mind that these shirts were well used over the course of the season. Certainly the Yellow GK shirt saw plenty of mud that year!

Any guys from New York City on here? I'm over there at end Nov/Early Dec. Maybe I could drop off a shirt off for someone?

I am a Vet (in a small practise, not Medivet). Personally I was appalled by a lot of things in the program. Some of it was due to inexperience and bad supervision, and some of it was a lot worse. It is important to remember that this is exceptional (panorama were filming for 9 months undercover to get the footage shown). I do think some of the footage could easily have been taken out of context to make it look as bad as possible, so try not to take the whole program at face value. However, I'm not going to defend the indefensible.

Although Medivet can be quite an impersonal type of practise, I seriously do not believe the program reflects the vast majority of Medivet's employees. The vet at the end has already been struck off (no one apart from the BBC had seen the program before last night) - we do have effective mechanisms to keep our house in order. But evidently Medivet has some work to do to sort out their bad apples, and the rest of the profession likewise.

I don't live in NY but it's only an hour away and make a trip to the city a few times every year to visit. If no one else is closer, let me know and I'll see what the schedule looks like a little closer to the date. Maybe I have a NY hockey jersey to swap or maybe the **reddit admins** might find some money in the coffers for some reddit futbol jerseys! (lol, like that would happen!)
