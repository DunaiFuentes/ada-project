Firstly, because there is a cost - I have some old council tax debts, and if I'm not on the electoral register here it is harder to find me.

Secondly, because I feel it would be legitimising to an illegitimate system. Britain has never been a democracy, for all that it has had some inspiring democratic moments. It has always been by and for the rich.

Instead of voting, I believe in taking action to effect political change. 

There was an interesting study a couple of years ago that found that the odds of environmental legislation being passed in the US did not correlate in any way with the party in power, but did correlate with the amount of environmentalist direct action at the time.

I used to be active in various bits of politics. Anti-war stuff back when Iraq kicked off, couple of summit protests, couple of years of helping to run politicised social/community centres, work in the housing struggles in Glasgow. At the moment I'm not active, so instead I donate.

I have great doubts about the ability of the various movements (stuff I mention + unions, other causes...) to make real changes to our political system. Not because they don't have power - they have huge potential power - but because they lack any real vision and are often tactically naive.

Therefore, I am currently donating to and may join http://www.libertyandsolidarity.org .

Two points I can share - 

1. I don't have to have a solution to be allowed to criticise. 

2. What I have by way of an alternative will have to be arrived at through some sort of voluntary movement by the citizens of a given state. I find it hard to see how a better society will come about by people being sold ideas or cajoled. 

Having said that, I am pro the dissembling of the nation-state and devolving society into small autonomous communities where coercion and the accumulation of material wealth are frowned upon. Small communities could cooperate with each other in order to deal with larger scale problems but in general there would be no large-scale government. As far as I understand it, the natives of America existed in this way before their society was destroyed. 

I am not really the best person to go into much depth about this since I don't have the skills required or the time it would take to lay out a whole philosophical and political theory.

If I saw a party with a real feeling of honesty so that from being completely uninformed you could understand their principles within 5 mins of going on their website then I would vote.

1. For every person that votes, it adds credibility to the winner. Even if many of the voters wasted votes by voting for completely useless entities. If less than 1% of people voted, we might change the system to something more useful than a popularity contest for unpopular people. 

2. Even if only a million people vote, my opinion is worth 1% of 1% of 1% of the whole. People would agree that playing the lottery is a stupid waste of resources, however an election offers an even lower chance of me noticing any difference in my life, and the rewards are pathetic in comparison.

You either vote for all of a party's ideas, or none of them. Everyone who votes chooses *none of the policies* from almost every party, I go 1 party further. 

Until democracy becomes more fine grained and we actually get a say in *things we would like the government to do on our behalf* or more importantly *which things we never want to be done in our names* there is no point in selecting one of the bloated collections of policies that are constructed mainly to attract votes.

You have to decide which of your views you are prepared to negotiate on. You may agree with candiate 1 on 70% of their policies, candidate 2 50% and candidate 3 20%....simple really, you vote for the best fit.

Then again, you may decided that the 30% of candidate 1 you dont agree with contains your one big issue, the one you will not negotiate. But candidate 2 supports that issue and the other 50% you dont agree with you can live with....so vote candidate 2.

Not voting is NEVER an option, although a 'None of the above' box would be an important compromise. If NOTA gets more than 50% of the vote it triggers a reelection.

No, but I have no idea what is the correct term.

&gt;I refuse to accept that we have to tolerate the principle of dog-eat-dog or might-makes-right. The whole point of evolution is to evolve. The baddest cunt getting his way by punching someone else harder is not the part of our nature we need to be defending. We need to look to the part of our nature that is cooperative and tolerant.

I wasn't saying it's the way It should be, or the way I would like it to be, I was saying that is the way it is, regardless of the philosophy you adopt might may not make right but might will beat right.

&gt;Erm, you mean if they were more like us? We have destroyed the ecosystem in 200 years. Where is the inherent advantage in that? You might think it's brilliant driving your car and playing on your computer but the poor impoverished people who labour to provide all of this don't and your progeny will not be thanking you as they starve to death or whatever it is they have to look forward to.

In that money and goods are power, it might be terrible in the long term but that's not what I'm saying, i'm saying in the short term (short enough to win influence over your neighbours) being materialistic is a stronger strategy.

&gt;Let's not give in to the temptation to promote the righteousness of a dog-eat-dog mentality. Surely it is worth aspiring to more.

By not voting?

Also I haven't said what I consider that it is or isn't worth aspiring to, my argument concerns what is practical.

&gt;I think Anarchism offers several plausible alternatives to the current way of (mis)managing the places in which we live and our relationships with other living beings.

He was engaging because he was honest, truthful and most importantly he seemed like he really understood what he was talking about.

Voting just props the whole system up by making it look democratic.


Not voting or spoiling your ballot paper is a symbol of wanting something better. The millions and millions of us who won’t vote will be doing so because we don’t believe the lies the politicians come out with, because we recognise that they’re a part of our problems, not the answer to them, and because we want a better world.


Instead of voting for some politician’s empty promises to solve our problems, we’ll be talking to the people around us – our friends, families, neighbours and workmates – about what we can actually do to solve our problems ourselves.

There are local councils, and they are represented by members of political parties, but the changes they make are things like whether to build a road, demolish a building, and how to collect rubbish not how to fund the NHS, the police, and education, although they might decide to close a school or build a new one.

That's why they kept on saying things like 'when I visited Burnley' because they want to appear (whether they do or not is another matter) to care about the whole country.

I know about education, and in the case of that the curriculum is prescribed nationally (which I actually disagree with), pretty much every lesson is planned out, or at least the topics that need to be covered are, school funding is also determined by central government (to a region and then in that region's local government get a bit of control on what they do with it). 

I know in the USA individual states have a lot of control, well basically, just imagine that layer didn't exist (as obviously the UK is a lot smaller), and that power was given to central government, that's basically the power that the government have.

Wales and Scotland are a bit different, they have their own parliaments, and they have a lot more control (but they still answer to Westminster).

Ironically they were introduced by Thatcher, when she was busy privatising everything, personally I don't think they're as bad as they're made out to be, and they're easy to vilify, but they do perform some important roles.

Maybe they just won't decommission nuclear reactors quite as well.

It all stayed well within the accepted boundaries of mainstream political debate.

(then each of them performed a modern dance to express the sentiment: ""I'm not a racist BUT I'd quite like the vote of the unreconstucted neanderthals in our urban marginal constituencies..."").

The most significant thing about this debate IMO was that it puts the Liberals on a more level playing field with the other two parties. It's been a two-party state for so long that in many constituencies with a historically small LD vote, people won't vote LD because it's seen as a wasted vote. The Liberals have been arguing for proportional representation because of this; not surprisingly the other two won't hear of it.

If the election is close (and it is likely to be), we get a hung parliament, in which the winner - tory or labour - would be seeking the support of Lib Dems to get legislation through. And do deals &amp; introduce other legislation in return. So there's at last a *chance* that we'll see some meaningful electoral reform in the forseeable future.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I wouldn't, we all would :)

I get the question, you want to know what I'm advocating. I can't give you a blueprint for the new society, because the process of its creation has to be participatory and democratic.

That said, I can describe how these things have been done before, or even are being done now, on various scales and with various degrees of ""purity"".

Broadly speaking, I seek a highly democratic classless society. The power granted by controlling either the state or productive property would be abolished. Firstly, by the creation of workplace democracy. Secondly, by the creation of a participatory state (most anarchists would argue that it is not a ""state"" at all at this point) - essentially a decentralised federation run by mass-meeting democracy.

Usually this has functioned by mass meetings (tens to a couple of hundred people, depending on context) appointing mandated recallable delegates to accomplish specific tasks such as coordination across a wider area, or taking day-to-day executive decisions. The existence of mass meetings, a written mandate (composed/approved by the mass meetings), and a recall clause prevents these positions from becoming new centre of power.

Examples:

* the Paris Commune
* Factories and Soviets early in the Russian revolution
* Peasant villages in Ukraine during the Russian revolution
* Factories and peasant villages in the Spanish revolution/civil war
* The Zapatistas (southern mexican rebels)
* Workplaces in Yugoslavia under Tito (imperfect but important example of combining workplace democracy and a market)
* Mondragon (giant multinational worker's co-op thing)

It's one of the few things I didn't like about Tennant's Doctor--even though I know other writers were writing the part.

1) Built an army of evil smiley robots that can somehow be people.

3) Created a voting mechanism whereby anyone who dissents is fed to the beast.

Well, the system is pretty fucked up. However, work is such a scam. The majority of the population have been sold the idea that there is dignity in slaving away performing meaningless tasks in the service of the rich company-owners. I applaud anyone who shirks from this. 

&gt;The bank bailouts are a completely seperate issue. I don't see that one arguably innapropiate distribution of tax payers money justifies another.

I agree. And disagree. The bank bailouts are justified on the basis that allowing the mega-rich to prosper without risk of loss somehow helps everyone due to the ""trickle-down"" theory. I think this is nonsense and why not just give money to those who need it directly?

It's a system, it's not perfect, but it works quite a bit better than everyone trying to ""shirk"" work.

I'm still going to stick with the bank bailout is irrelevant to the points here, though I find it interesting you mention giving ""the money to those who need it directly"". Does this family need a Mercedes people carrier and a 42 inch plasma screen tv? Is providing benefits to pay for their Sky subscription and Nintendo game consoles the best way to use our money? I'd have alot more sympathy if they had a Vauxhall Zafira and a 28"" crt, as my family does.

I think this family represents exactly what is wrong with the benefits system. The father quit his job because he was better off on benefits, and now will probably always be better off on benefits because since then he's had no career progression, only more children.

There was much more color than I expected. Even in the bunkers there were a wide array of colored things brightening things up from the dull walls. The phones were especially a nice touch. There were lots of colors happening in the Dalek ship. Lots of reds and blues on the hull of this ship. And of course the Rainbow Daleks.

The rainbow Daleks were cute, but aren't they supposed to be scary? I can't help but whisper ""Aw, who's a cute Dalek? You are! It's you!"" when they are on screen. They looked cool, but I don't understand the choice for brightly colored Daleks. It's easier to be afraid of dark, dirty Dalek's than it is to be afraid of the Dalek's cheerleading squad. 

I think the Doctor and Amy are ending up in the kind of relationship I'd like them to have. There doesn't seem to be too much sexual tension. The Doctor calling Amy ""Amelia"" when he didn't want her to do something was very fatherly, as was the kiss on the forehead for a job well done. Much better than Amy pining over the Doctor or the two dancing around eachother like both Rose and early Martha did.

Yeah, I was not a fan of this one. It had a few good moments, the Jammy Dodger was funny but there were too many bad points. 

For a start, I really don't like the new Dalek design. I don't care about the colours so much, but they're a weird shape. They look like hunchbacks. 

More seriously though, how many times do we have to see the same Dalek story? There was already an episode where the Daleks were all destroyed but One Ship Survived, and the Daleks used a stray bit of DNA to bring themselves back and the Doctor had to choose between destroying them forever and saving the world. It was the first Dalek episode with Christopher Eccleston. And the first season finale. And, minus the ending, the Second season finale. And the fourth season finale. And possibly that episode in New York, but I'm not sure. That shit didn't even make any sense. 

I likes me some Dalek episodes, but they really need to come up with a new spin on it. I also think we are long overdue for a Steven Moffat Dalek episode, so I won't complain if they come back for the next finale. I wish they could ditch that new design though.

EDIT: Oh, and did anyone else think you could lift the Robot Guy right out of the story and it would make no difference? Just have The Doctor invent something instead.

I am in 100% agreement.

&gt; They're trying to play with a lot of big thematic elements, and the last couple of episodes could have stood to be two-parters.

Perhaps, or perhaps they could have focused on ONE or TWO elements instead of so many.

Yesterday, we had :

 - Daleks being soldiers
 - Winston wanting to steal the TARDIS
 - A scientist ""inventing"" the Daleks on his own, but who was built by the Daleks
 - The scientist is also a bomb
 - The Daleks want to first destroy the WORLD by lighting up London
 - But the scientist invented a gravity bubble
 - which allows for WWII planes to go in space to destroy an emitted
 - But the Doctor needs first to turn off the shields
etc..

Compare to ""The Girl in the Fireplace"":

 - The Doctor, Rose and Mickey arrive on a deserted spaceship in future which has a portal to 17th century France
 - Mechanical robots used the crew for parts to repair the ship
 - They opened the portals to steal the brain of Mme de Pompadour
 - The Doctor and her fall in love while he tries to protect her

That's pretty much it...

And The Beast Below was just as overfilled !

&gt; They're trying to play with a lot of big thematic elements, and the last couple of episodes could have stood to be two-parters.

Perhaps, but were the subjects interesting enough for a 2 parter ?

It doesn't just fund greedy MPs. It funds the NHS, roads, state schools, housing, etc. - public services have to be paid for. You really need to re-evaluate the scale of expenditure, yes the scroungers and expenses were bad, but it is negligible compared to the cost of Trident, etc.

And since we've already accepted the violations of what we believe to be the fundamental laws of physics (remember, gravity is still not well-understood), I see no harm in accepting that planes can fly in the bubble.

Frankly, it seems a bit silly to me that you're willing to accept the idea of a generator that can produce gravity from nothing, but refuse to accept the idea that the gravity it produces doesn't act like conventional gravity (i.e it only pulls objects one way).",0,1271593096,null,0,false,0,c0ocygn,t3_bsd2m,t1_c0ocygn,t1_c0ocybf,null,1426279433,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,essjay2009,cnty-wales,Bristol,"The current electoral system is fundamentally broken, but fortunately the Lib Dems have a real opportunity to fix it (through negotiations on electoral reform with whichever party they end up partnering with in the eventuality of a hung parliament).  The problem has been that constituency boundaries are generally drawn up to favour the party that's in power.  So, at the moment, Labour have many small constituencies (mostly Town &amp; City) whilst the Tories have much larger constituencies (mostly country folk).  These are their so-called safe seats.  Labour remained in power despite having a smaller share of the popular vote than the Tories in 2005.  Any system in which that can happen is, in my opinion, undemocratic.

The plus side is that I'm incredibly powerful.  I'm an undecided (Lib Dem leaning) voter living in one of the most marginal seats in the country.

It's not work, I'm a freelance writer so I can work from anywhere with an occasional internet connection and my trusty netbook.

My dad lives out here, so I'm kind of visiting him.

But really it's a precursor to a bit of a jolly around Europe. I worked for a company in Brighton for the last 3 or so years that hired a lot of foreign interns for 4-6 month periods, and I made a lot of friends there. Quite a few have offered me places to stay in Germany, Austria, Spain, Belgium, France, Portugal, Poland, Russia, and a couple of other places. So I'm going to go sofa surfing and try and find a country in which I'd rather live. I fucking hate living in the UK now. It's expensive, it's shit, the majority of the people are fuckwits, and it's getting worse every day. I don't really feel like I belong there any more, and I don't want to work my arse off for a mediocre existence.

Plus I never travelled much before last year. Just Amsterdam quite a lot. I'm 26, single and freelance so it's a good time/situation to start. Last year I spent a little time visiting friends in Spain and Shanghai after I went freelance and it kind of opened my eyes... I have no idea why I've been in England for so long, the only thing keeping me there is my friends and family. I should have pissed off years ago.

Why Ukraine... well, it's really cheap here, I can live rent free with my dad and his lovely new family for a couple of months (he remarried 5-6 years ago to a Ukrainian girl nearly half his age and came to live here (he didn't buy her online, haha)). Allows me to save up money for travelling pretty quickly since I've got barely any outgoings (beer is 30p a pint in pubs, instead of £3.70 in Brighton. I bought a decent pair of shoes for £11 today. Cigarettes are about 35p a pack. I don't even smoke any more but damn it it's suddenly very tempting.).

Plus it really is kinda nice here, despite most people's preconceptions of the country. It's quiet. A bit backwards, a bit bleak in places... soooo many mullets. Holy Jupiter, the mullets. But there's everything I need, and it's about time I wasn't spoiled for choice. And all the produce and meat is all fresh... no battery farm eggs or pasteurised milk, it's all straight from the farmyard. Sure the maximum internet speed is 2Mbit, they don't even know what cashew nuts are, and I'm the only Englishman for about 200 miles so I get stared at in public... but hey, I can deal with all that. It's good times for now.

Plus the girls are hot, far better sorts than the cheap dirtboxes that are all over the UK. Which is nice.

Sorry for the length. I suck at pithy.

The only reason I haven't done it before is I moved to Manchester in January 09 (and quickly came back) and hated being away from my friends and family. I got used to it eventually, but I'm 22 and my mum lives nearby so I'm not sure I'm emotionally mature enough to live abroad yet. Plus I always harboured a desire to be a writer too... Although I'm too lazy, so if anything I'm more likely to become a sub-editor. Anyway, I disgress. I totally know what you mean. I do love Brighton though.

(Or I'm completely off the mark and you don't smoke at all... in which case, sorry :D)

My advice (if the advice of somebody who hasn't quite done it but at least has decided to do it is worth anything to you) would be to start saving now. At least visit some places, even if you have no plans to move there. I'm sure you have some places in mind already. Make friends in foreign countries who will put you up for a couple of weeks. I guess 22 is still pretty young but I honestly wish I'd started travelling earlier.

Shanghai was so amazing for me, a real eye-opening experience. It cost me about £400 to get there and back by plane, and another ~£50 for the visa, but once you're out there it's pretty cheap to live and eat. I had one of the best months of my life there. Met some amazing and interesting people, the food is just *incredible*, and it was just an all round brilliant cultural experience. I feel like I learned a lot from living in a totally different culture, even for just a month. I've always had a hard-on for Asia, Japan is the ultimate goal really but it's even more expensive over there than in the UK, but I'm kind of hoping that at some point money won't be my main worry and I can go out there and do Tokyo/Osaka/etc.. I'm a linguaphile, too (Latin &amp; Greek at uni with extra Japanese, also fairly fluent French and German), so I'm hoping to get semi-fluent in a few languages while travelling.

It was also a really creative atmosphere too, my writing thrived and I was able to make a lot of money while being out there, and living costs are very cheap. Beer in supermarkets is about 25p a can, about 75p to a pound in local bars. Yeah, I tend to measure the living costs in each city by how much a beer is... probably should get out of that habit.

I think with the way the UK is going these days, we're not in the minority of people who would like to live abroad. I consider myself really lucky to have been given the opportunity to work as a freelancer. It allows me to earn money while travelling, so as long as I keep working, I can do it indefinitely.

I do miss Brighton a little bit... not nearly enough to want to come back yet, though. I lived there all my life with a 3 year stint at Nottingham for university... nice enough city, shit people.

The only difference between the two broadcasts is that the tv viewers got the impression that Kenedy was ""nicer"" purely on visuals.

The food at the Windmill is excellent, though. Don't really go there that much since I've never lived in that area. Grew up in Hove, went to Nottingham, came back and moved to another place in Hove, then to Portslade, then near Fishersgate, back to Hove, then to Kemp Town.

Re: the language books, I never had much success from them unless I was really motivated. Enrol in some language classes if you can afford it. Or if you really want to learn, put an ad on Gumtree or something and find a native speaker you can go out and meet for a drink every week or so, and spend half the time speaking English, and half the time speaking their language. There are so many foreigners in Brighton looking to improve their English, they'll be glad for the opportunity to practice and to make friends. I was really lucky to have met all those interns, hanging out with them inside and outside of work and encouraging them to speak their native languages with me really helped me improve my French/German, plus I learned to swear in about 8 different languages, which is always useful. Unless you're seriously motivated to practice regularly and force yourself to learn through your free time, you're never going to get much from 'teach yourself' books and audio courses.

This is coming from someone who worked at a language teaching company for 3 years... so... yeah. Honestly, hands-on 1-to-1 conversational/immersion learning beats the book method hands down.

She she'd rather ask for forgiveness than permission. Being exposed to space, time travel, and alien life forms hasn't changed that. 

The Doctor seems surprised at this. I think he's not used to having his authority overriden, decisions being made without his consultation, actions being taken without his permission. 

And the fact that Amy is completely unapologetic about it, makes her all the more lovable. She has deep respect for the Doctor, but she's not completely in awe of him like Martha was. He's just a guy. A guy who doesn't get it right all the time.

And you're right, I suppose. Episode 2 wasn't necessarily about being human. The fact remains, though, that the doctor has now twice in a row come up short in some way, and Amy has to be the one who solves the problem.

He's going to make a mess of things, which will necessitate going back into Amy's timeline to patch things together.  It just hasn't happened yet for him.

Then I considered what it might all mean (granted, I was very stoned) and I thought of his relationship with River.  Maybe they had a child.

Eventually, the Doctor will have to give a sonic screwdriver to River, and in his grief will go back to their child, perhaps not even knowing what he's doing until it's too late.  Then he has to seal that time closed so that Amy can't remember it, and that crack in the wall signifies that lost time.  Maybe this is even when River is still alive, and the only way the Doctor can preserve the proper chronology is to erase his daughter's memories of her parents.

In a way, even that sonic screwdriver is reaching back and messing with his own chronology.  I may rewatch the Library episodes later, looking for a crack.

*edit - and in this case my explanation **certainly does** make sense. Yes, the Doctor and the TARDIS have been established to be symbiotically linked, yet for centuries he has needed a key to enter it when the door has been locked. Ten had a keyless entry system as revealed in the first part of the End of Time, and now Eleven can snap his fingers to enter, but it sure as fuck makes sense to me that he needs a physical link **(like maybe a KEY, also established to be a part of the TARDIS in the Sound of Drums)** to the TARDIS so that the TARDIS knows it is him who snaps and doesn't open up for just anybody who snaps his/her fingers like the kid's head in The Long Game.

Before now Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats have said whatever you want to hear, and been able to get away with too little scrutiny. In 2010, nothing's changed. They'll still say anything to get your vote in the hope they wont ever have to deliver. Just take a look for yourself (sources can be found at the bottom):

-Flip- flopping on the Euro: Before the recession, they wanted us to join the Euro. Now it appears they don't (Or at least aren't prepared to say if they want us to join or not). Is this confirmation that where before, they were blinded by an ideological commitment to further integration with Europe, they have now realized that surrendering control of our interest rates and our own independent exchange rate most appropriate for the UK economy would have been wrong? In a recent radio interview, he admitted that joining the Euro would have weakened the UK economy even further in the recession, yet he still hasn't ruled out future membership. Can we afford this kind of indecision?

-Vague on defence: They stand for abolishing Trident, but refuse to say whether this means removing the nuclear deterrent. Presumably, they acknowledge a world where Iran is marching towards a nuclear arsenal (as well as North Korea) is not a world which is moving towards mutual disarmament. But what is their stance? Do they want a proper deterrent, or do they want to do it on the cheap?

-Indecision on tuition fees: After admitting they cannot afford to enact their original plan to let students got to University for “free” (someone, somewhere, picks up the bill) after a month of dithering, Nick Clegg and the Lib Dem's eventually said they would plan to phase them out ""over 6 years"". Ignoring that this vague commitment sidesteps the fact a term in Parliament is 5 years, they are yet to say where the £7.5 billion cost of this would come from. Presumably, through increases in tax. The party of fairness?

-Giving criminals the vote: Nick Clegg believes that people serving time in prison deserve the right to vote in an election. Do you?

-U-turns on the economy: This needs a few points in itself....
1) On September 19th 2009, Nick Clegg said we need bold and even ""savage"" cuts in government spending, which will be necessary to bring the public deficit (standing at £168 billion) under control. On April 11th, 2010, he warned of ""Greek style"" unrest and ""serious social strife"" if tax increases and cuts in spending were enacted. Indecision a fragile economy can afford?
2) Clegg says the Tories are being naive taking the government’s projected savings on waste into account in their NI calculations, and then takes the same figures on for the benefit of his own deficit-reduction calculations. 
3) Despite the fact we face a £168 billion budget deficit, Nick Clegg has only identified £10 billion in savings. And they say they're being honest with you?
4) Promises to raise the income tax threshold are based on hypothetical calculations of revenue from tax increases elsewhere. According to the Institute for Fiscal studies, “Whether the revenue raising measures would yield what they expect is... uncertain” and that it is feasible they “Could raise less” than expected.

-Flip -flops on property tax: Before, the Liberal Democrats wanted to abolish property tax in favour of a ""local income tax"". In 2009, they made a calculation that meant they now supported tax on property in the form of their ""mansion tax"". Within a month, they had already fallen into disarray on the policy, and doubled the threshold for property to be affected by the tax. The idea may not be wrong, but such indecision is hardly a ringing endorsement for a party to wield significant power in Westminster.

-Dodgy donors: They like to pretend they're whiter than white on this. Their 2005 campaign was supported with a £2.4 million donation (at a time they said no party should take donations of more than £50,000) from a man later convicted of fraud. One of their other major donors, Sudhir Choudhrie, has been accused of taking kickbacks from foreign governments for arms deals. When they criticize the other parties, you should ask: Is this just a case of hypocrisy, or just a naive belief that they are free from scrutiny?

-Dubious expenses: In one four month period, Nick Clegg claimed a staggering £1,657.32 on groceries. When he was an MEP, he travelled economy class, but claimed for Business class, claiming the difference for ""office expenses”. Not to mention the four Lib Dem MPs that were ordered to repay £16,500 for over claiming on expensive rent for Dolphin Square apartments near Parliament.

-No commitment on the NHS: They are the only major party with no commitment to protect spending on the NHS. Their commitment to protect ""key services"" is based on ""efficiency savings"". All well and good, but why can't they say they'll keep the current levels of investment for the NHS? What's more, they refuse to commit to protecting A&amp;E and Maternity services, saying it would be left to a ""local health board"". A convenient way of avoiding any accountability for cuts?

-An immigration policy for you?: They sure are different from the main parties on this one. As well as wanting to reward around 600,000 illegal immigrants with citizenship, they don't want any limit on inward migration. Instead, they simply want to move them around to different regions.

Everything the Liberal Democrats say is shrouded by uncertainty, vague ""commitments"" and U-turns. Is this a party which can be trusted in times of uncertainty? Do you think a time of crisis and uncertainty needs serious leadership, or Nick Clegg with his flip- flops?

According to the Institute for Fiscal studies, “Whether the revenue raising measures would yield what they expect is... uncertain” and that it is feasible they “Could raise less” than expected.

-Flip -flops on property tax: Before, the Liberal Democrats wanted to abolish property tax in favour of a ""local income tax"". In 2009, they made a calculation that meant they now supported tax on property in the form of their ""mansion tax"". Within a month, they had already fallen into disarray on the policy, and doubled the threshold for property to be affected by the tax. The idea may not be wrong, but such indecision is hardly a ringing endorsement for a party to wield significant power in Westminster.

-Dodgy donors: They like to pretend they're whiter than white on this. Their 2005 campaign was supported with a £2.4 million donation (at a time they said no party should take donations of more than £50,000) from a man later convicted of fraud. One of their other major donors, Sudhir Choudhrie, has been accused of taking kickbacks from foreign governments for arms deals. When they criticize the other parties, you should ask: Is this just a case of hypocrisy, or just a naive belief that they are free from scrutiny?

-Dubious expenses: In one four month period, Nick Clegg claimed a staggering £1,657.32 on groceries. When he was an MEP, he travelled economy class, but claimed for Business class, claiming the difference for ""office expenses”. Not to mention the four Lib Dem MPs that were ordered to repay £16,500 for over claiming on expensive rent for Dolphin Square apartments near Parliament.

-No commitment on the NHS: They are the only major party with no commitment to protect spending on the NHS. Their commitment to protect ""key services"" is based on ""efficiency savings"". All well and good, but why can't they say they'll keep the current levels of investment for the NHS? What's more, they refuse to commit to protecting A&amp;E and Maternity services, saying it would be left to a ""local health board"". A convenient way of avoiding any accountability for cuts?

-An immigration policy for you?: They sure are different from the main parties on this one. As well as wanting to reward around 600,000 illegal immigrants with citizenship, they don't want any limit on inward migration. Instead, they simply want to move them around to different regions.

Everything the Liberal Democrats say is shrouded by uncertainty, vague ""commitments"" and U-turns. Is this a party which can be trusted in times of uncertainty? Do you think a time of crisis and uncertainty needs serious leadership, or Nick Clegg with his flip- flops?

Voting for Labour will not keep the tories out. Voting conservative will not keep Labour out. No matter whom he votes for, his one single vote will have zero impact on the outcome of the election.

This does not matter, however, since **that's not what votes are for**. An individual vote is not a chance to influence the outcome of an election, but is an expression of your own political viewpoint. Politicians will change their position to attract more votes, and they will attempt to do this based on how everyone voted, not just on the people who voted for the winner, or for the first two places. Therefore you should always vote for whichever candidate most closely represents your views, since all candidates (including whoever gets in, and whoever stands next time round) will look where votes are going and change their behavior accordingly.",0,1271784917,null,0,false,0,c0oi1xv,t3_bt1rm,t1_c0oi1xv,t1_c0of1wn,null,1426281812,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
true,mjpboi,null,null,"Tricky Nicky and his U-turns, flip flops and budget black holes is hardly something we can afford. Before now Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats have said whatever you want to hear, and been able to get away with too little scrutiny. In 2010, nothing's changed. They'll still say anything to get your vote in the hope they wont ever have to deliver. Just take a look for yourself (sources can be found at the bottom):

-Flip- flopping on the Euro: Before the recession, they wanted us to join the Euro. Now it appears they don't (Or at least aren't prepared to say if they want us to join or not). Is this confirmation that where before, they were blinded by an ideological commitment to further integration with Europe, they have now realized that surrendering control of our interest rates and our own independent exchange rate most appropriate for the UK economy would have been wrong? In a recent radio interview, he admitted that joining the Euro would have weakened the UK economy even further in the recession, yet he still hasn't ruled out future membership. Can we afford this kind of indecision?

-Vague on defence: They stand for abolishing Trident, but refuse to say whether this means removing the nuclear deterrent. Presumably, they acknowledge a world where Iran is marching towards a nuclear arsenal (as well as North Korea) is not a world which is moving towards mutual disarmament. But what is their stance? Do they want a proper deterrent, or do they want to do it on the cheap?

-Indecision on tuition fees: After admitting they cannot afford to enact their original plan to let students got to University for “free” (someone, somewhere, picks up the bill) after a month of dithering, Nick Clegg and the Lib Dem's eventually said they would plan to phase them out ""over 6 years"". Ignoring that this vague commitment sidesteps the fact a term in Parliament is 5 years, they are yet to say where the £7.5 billion cost of this would come from. Presumably, through increases in tax. The party of fairness?

-Giving criminals the vote: Nick Clegg believes that people serving time in prison deserve the right to vote in an election. Do you?

-U-turns on the economy: This needs a few points in itself....
1) On September 19th 2009, Nick Clegg said we need bold and even ""savage"" cuts in government spending, which will be necessary to bring the public deficit (standing at £168 billion) under control. On April 11th, 2010, he warned of ""Greek style"" unrest and ""serious social strife"" if tax increases and cuts in spending were enacted. Indecision a fragile economy can afford?
2) Clegg says the Tories are being naive taking the government’s projected savings on waste into account in their NI calculations, and then takes the same figures on for the benefit of his own deficit-reduction calculations. 
3) Despite the fact we face a £168 billion budget deficit, Nick Clegg has only identified £10 billion in savings. And they say they're being honest with you?
4) Promises to raise the income tax threshold are based on hypothetical calculations of revenue from tax increases elsewhere. According to the Institute for Fiscal studies, “Whether the revenue raising measures would yield what they expect is... uncertain” and that it is feasible they “Could raise less” than expected.

When he was an MEP, he travelled economy class, but claimed for Business class, claiming the difference for ""office expenses”. Not to mention the four Lib Dem MPs that were ordered to repay £16,500 for over claiming on expensive rent for Dolphin Square apartments near Parliament.

-No commitment on the NHS: They are the only major party with no commitment to protect spending on the NHS. Their commitment to protect ""key services"" is based on ""efficiency savings"". All well and good, but why can't they say they'll keep the current levels of investment for the NHS? What's more, they refuse to commit to protecting A&amp;E and Maternity services, saying it would be left to a ""local health board"". A convenient way of avoiding any accountability for cuts?

-An immigration policy for you?: They sure are different from the main parties on this one. As well as wanting to reward around 600,000 illegal immigrants with citizenship, they don't want any limit on inward migration. Instead, they simply want to move them around to different regions.

Everything the Liberal Democrats say is shrouded by uncertainty, vague ""commitments"" and U-turns. Is this a party which can be trusted in times of uncertainty? Do you think a time of crisis and uncertainty needs serious leadership, or Nick Clegg with his flip- flops?

true,mjpboi,null,null,"Tricky Nicky and his U-turns, flip flops and budget black holes is hardly something we can afford. Before now Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats have said whatever you want to hear, and been able to get away with too little scrutiny. In 2010, nothing's changed. They'll still say anything to get your vote in the hope they wont ever have to deliver. Just take a look for yourself (sources can be found at the bottom):

-Flip- flopping on the Euro: Before the recession, they wanted us to join the Euro. Now it appears they don't (Or at least aren't prepared to say if they want us to join or not). Is this confirmation that where before, they were blinded by an ideological commitment to further integration with Europe, they have now realized that surrendering control of our interest rates and our own independent exchange rate most appropriate for the UK economy would have been wrong? In a recent radio interview, he admitted that joining the Euro would have weakened the UK economy even further in the recession, yet he still hasn't ruled out future membership. Can we afford this kind of indecision?

-Vague on defence: They stand for abolishing Trident, but refuse to say whether this means removing the nuclear deterrent. Presumably, they acknowledge a world where Iran is marching towards a nuclear arsenal (as well as North Korea) is not a world which is moving towards mutual disarmament. But what is their stance? Do they want a proper deterrent, or do they want to do it on the cheap?

-Indecision on tuition fees: After admitting they cannot afford to enact their original plan to let students got to University for “free” (someone, somewhere, picks up the bill) after a month of dithering, Nick Clegg and the Lib Dem's eventually said they would plan to phase them out ""over 6 years"". Ignoring that this vague commitment sidesteps the fact a term in Parliament is 5 years, they are yet to say where the £7.5 billion cost of this would come from. Presumably, through increases in tax. The party of fairness?

-Giving criminals the vote: Nick Clegg believes that people serving time in prison deserve the right to vote in an election. Do you?

-U-turns on the economy: This needs a few points in itself....
1) On September 19th 2009, Nick Clegg said we need bold and even ""savage"" cuts in government spending, which will be necessary to bring the public deficit (standing at £168 billion) under control. On April 11th, 2010, he warned of ""Greek style"" unrest and ""serious social strife"" if tax increases and cuts in spending were enacted. Indecision a fragile economy can afford?
2) Clegg says the Tories are being naive taking the government’s projected savings on waste into account in their NI calculations, and then takes the same figures on for the benefit of his own deficit-reduction calculations. 
3) Despite the fact we face a £168 billion budget deficit, Nick Clegg has only identified £10 billion in savings. And they say they're being honest with you?
4) Promises to raise the income tax threshold are based on hypothetical calculations of revenue from tax increases elsewhere. According to the Institute for Fiscal studies, “Whether the revenue raising measures would yield what they expect is... uncertain” and that it is feasible they “Could raise less” than expected.

-Flip -flops on property tax: Before, the Liberal Democrats wanted to abolish property tax in favour of a ""local income tax"". In 2009, they made a calculation that meant they now supported tax on property in the form of their ""mansion tax"". Within a month, they had already fallen into disarray on the policy, and doubled the threshold for property to be affected by the tax. The idea may not be wrong, but such indecision is hardly a ringing endorsement for a party to wield significant power in Westminster.

-Dodgy donors: They like to pretend they're whiter than white on this. Their 2005 campaign was supported with a £2.4 million donation (at a time they said no party should take donations of more than £50,000) from a man later convicted of fraud. One of their other major donors, Sudhir Choudhrie, has been accused of taking kickbacks from foreign governments for arms deals. When they criticize the other parties, you should ask: Is this just a case of hypocrisy, or just a naive belief that they are free from scrutiny?

-Dubious expenses: In one four month period, Nick Clegg claimed a staggering £1,657.32 on groceries. When he was an MEP, he travelled economy class, but claimed for Business class, claiming the difference for ""office expenses”. Not to mention the four Lib Dem MPs that were ordered to repay £16,500 for over claiming on expensive rent for Dolphin Square apartments near Parliament.

-No commitment on the NHS: They are the only major party with no commitment to protect spending on the NHS. Their commitment to protect ""key services"" is based on ""efficiency savings"". All well and good, but why can't they say they'll keep the current levels of investment for the NHS? What's more, they refuse to commit to protecting A&amp;E and Maternity services, saying it would be left to a ""local health board"". A convenient way of avoiding any accountability for cuts?

15 or so comments down, Evan Harris himself responds and completely rips apart whatever semblance of an argument she thought she had. Brilliant stuff:

&gt; I have met Christina on several occasions and she has always – at least to my face been polite and civil. How sad that she resorts to snide personal comments which she has publicly condemned in others. Why not just stick to the issues?

&gt; On the issues, it is true that, in common with 80% of the country and a majority of Christians, Lib Dems support – on a free vote for MPs and peers – the legalisation of assisted dying for the suffering terminally ill of sound mind. This is very different from “euthanasia” which would include involuntary and non-voluntary euthanasia (non-consenting or where no capacity to consent) which we of course oppose.

&gt; On abortion, there is no party policy. I support -a s does 80% of the population and the Church of England – the right of women not to be forced to go through pregnancy and give birth against their will. Abortion, when it happens, should take place as early as possible and our current laws should be amended to make access to early abortion easier to prevent delays.

&gt; I have never said that that the current abortion rate is not of import (you just made that up Christina!) and indeed have argued for more effective sex and relationships education as other countries manage and which also delays first sexual intercourse. And for better access to effective contraception. We can disagree on that too but best to have a rational discussion rather than a distortion.

&gt; I have never said “God is bad, his followers mad”. You made that up again Christina! I respect the religious view actually but believe that the state should be neutral on religion and it should not be privileged by the state above other beliefs.

&gt; Christina confuses secular policies with atheism. There are plenty of religious people in the Lib Dems eg Steve Webb, Tim Farron, Alan Beith, Simon Hughes, Charles Kennedy, Vince Cable, etc but many of the religious in the Lib Dems agree that religion should not be sponsored by the state and that we should not allow public authorities to discriminate against gay people in the name of religion.

&gt; The personal remarks are not worthy of response. I am genuinely surprised and disappointed with Christina’s shallow, personalised approach.

&gt; Not very Christian of her I would say.

* He ""stole"" a new set of regenerations before sealing the time lock. Or with the Time Lords sealed away, they are unable to enforce or control a regen limit

* The thirteenth Doctor will live a long life until he resembles Hartnell, and we realise his lifetime is a continuous loop

* He splits into two people for his last regeneration, as foreshadowed by the Valeyard. His foe in this regeneration is a ""dark Doctor"". The victor wins twelve new regenerations

I totally agree with your point about the middle classes. I believe there is a notion amongst politicians that the middle classes can look after themselves and that they contribute more to the economy then take. The reality is some middle class earners are just over the upper tax threshold paying 40% on their income. I firmly believe only people earning above ~£60k should be forced to pay the 40% higher rate, £37,400 (what it currently is) is not a massive salary, especially for middle management.

But there was never any question of him brandishing it or acting in a threatening way.  Nor did the Police suspect him of using it as a dangerous weapon.  The reasons that he gave for having it (cutting up fruit on a camping trip and for car maintenance) seem valid, even if the law doesn't consider them valid enough to warrant having a knife with a blade longer than 3"".

The article (and various others reporting it) suggest that he would never have been charged if he had agreed to surrender the knife on the spot.  It was because he believed in the principle that he *should* be allowed to have such a knife in his car for non-violent purposes and not be ""fined"" £30 on the spot (the value of the knife) that he chose to go to court... and lost.  

He fought the law and the law won.  But it demonstrates (to me at least) that the law can be an ass sometimes.  Tackling knife crime is one thing, but mistaking pensioners with a Swiss Army Knife for knife wielding criminals makes a mockery of the process.

&gt; there is more to this than the article is letting on.

Your point is valid, but I disagree with your conclusion. 

I saw the tail-end of some real-life cop show last night.  A car got pulled over because it flashed up on the police computer for a previous offence (once on the list, always on the list).  One of the first questions they asked was ""Have you got anything in your car that you shouldn't have... any drugs or weapons?""  

Now I imagine that this is fairly standard operating procedure.  They can't search the car without reasonable suspicion, but if they can get the driver to volunteer something like ""Well, I have a penknife in the glove box"" then they have what they need.  It's quite plausible (and I would say, likely) that this is the reason they ended up searching his car.  

Furthermore, they can't search a car without *permission*, but if the guy didn't believe he had done anything wrong and didn't want to appear to have something to hide, then it's very likely that he would have answered ""Yes"" when the officer asked ""Is it alright if we have a quick look in your car?""

A couple of weeks ago it was ""**Labour** are trying to play down **Gordon Brown**, and get away from the idea that **a vote for labour is a vote for Gordon Brown** (hehehehe)...

How do you justify this?

A: 'The question is so full of misapprehensions that I don't know where to start. The Conservative Party is allied with parties that share its view about Europe. It's not about backing someone's social policies, it's because we think Europe will be more open, more dynamic. We are allied with other parties that want that.

That said, they DID mention it a few tens of times in the classic series, so it should be addressed, hopefully in a way that will be cool to new fans and not piss off old time Whovians like me. The only way around it I can grasp at does have something to do with the Time Lords being gone, and sort of explains why he has a glowy effect now when he regenerates and didn't in the classic series. Since the Time Lords are gone from the universe then all the Artron energy in it is now soley used by the Doctor and his TARDIS. As this energy was used by hundreds (thousands?) of Time Lords and their technology then this basically gives the Doctor limitless resources to draw upon that are not managed anymore by the Matrix or Galifrey, therefore he can regenerate indefinitely, pilot his TARDIS wherever and whenever he likes and generally be a God of Time which is pretty much where they were going with Mccoy anyway just instead of being special in some arcane way he is now special because he is the Last and Time will not allow him to die which ties in with the Time's Champion theme we've seen with the 7th and 8th Doctors. I say they have the Doctor expect to die at the end of his 13th life and he doesn't with Time itself anthropomorphized telling him ""No, Doctor, you can never die, not ever.""

* edit - Just so you New Whovians and RTD fans will really hate me, I think the entire Time War idea (alongside the Human-Timelord jokecrisis and Donna Noble's entire character) was the worst mistake ever written into the show because it has caused more problems and continuity fuckups than it has fixed and basically fuck Mcgann, his Doctor should never have been written to have done something so large when he is largely unknown to fans and generally hated by me. Doctor Who has enough lore and mythos without it and now it's a fucking cancer on the whole show, even though I did like the End of Time. Without the Time War there would still be Galifrey and other Time Lords who could be used in MANY directions as plot devices, but trapped as they are they can only be used as they were in the End of Time and then only once.",0,1271883081,null,0,true,0,c0okwh1,t3_btu46,t1_c0okwh1,t3_btu46,null,1426283154,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,stronimo,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"&gt; Can someone explain to me (from US) the diff between Labour, Torries, and Lib Dem?

The Conservatives/Tories are the right-wing element in parliament, have filled that role consistently since the 16th century.

The Liberals (previously Whigs) have been on the progressive side of parliament for about the same amount of time, and can be thought of as the middle-class left-wing party. 

Labour entered parliament at the start of 20th century, representing new working class voters, advocating support for socialism[*] and the trade unions. They can be though of as the working-class left-wing party.

However, the strong class distinctions no longer exist in modern Britain. And, thanks to Tony Blair's reforms in the 1990s, Labour is no longer socialist and has separated itself from the trade unions. This removed the lines of separation between them and the Libs.

[*]In the 20th century European use of the word, not the modern American usage.

&gt; Why the shift to LibDem?

There are many opinions on this. Labour have been in power for 13 years, and people are ready for a change. 12 months ago it looked certain to be Cameron's Tories. But it is becoming clear, the Tories were benefiting from a vote against Labour rather than an endorsement of them. When people think there is a choice in opposing Labour, it seems they prefer Clegg to Cameron.

Clegg says that people are becoming less tribal about their politics, identifying themselves with political parties less, and being more willing to shop around for a representatives than in previous generations.

Another possibility, the Libs have actually enjoyed this level of  support for sometime, but have been suffering under a policy of carefully exclusion by the Murdoch-owned press (70% of the British market) as a matter of deliberate policy by the billionaire tyrant, and that has harmed their support at the polls.

People haven't been really happy with a government going back as far as the 70's (an exception is the first term of NL). However the historical 2 party lock in (in the 60's less than 2% cast a vote for anyone other than Labour or the Tories) has made it difficult to change anything.

The LDs were the first to really set out to change things. They were originally formed from the remnants of the old disenfranchised Liberal party (who were pushed out of power by Labour in the 20s) and a break away faction of Labour who were fed up with the far left element of the party. Their best campaign so far was actually their first where they took 28% of the vote but only managed a handful of seats.

Following this a lot of people gave up on breaking the monopoly and went back to least evil voting. However the LDs stayed alive just enough that they had some support. They held their seats and with tactical voting between Labour and LDs voters* they've slowly made gains. Knocking off a lot of the more moderate Tory seats.

What has held them back is the constant media message that they aren't a real political party and aren't going to ever win power. This has stopped them really consuming the Labour vote. The fear of a Tory government allowed in by a split Labour/LD vote has kept people in place. The debate has really blown that open. Firstly dissatisfaction is at its highest point ever. Secondly the debate has made people believe they have a chance.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Torries (conservatives) are your standard right wing affair (although probably no more right wing than the democrats in the US i.e. they don't want to ban abortions or have the death penalty). But they want us out of the EU and to cut immigration massively, their policies are generally built around cutting taxes (particularly for the rich) and cutting back public services.

Labour are historically left wing, sticking up for workers rights and what not, a lot of people vote for them because they were against all the cuts that thatcher made in the 80s. Having said that, that was old Labour, in 1996 Tony Blair dramatically changed the policies of the party and re-branded them 'new labour' to make them much more like the Tory party except generally they don't favour scrapping public services. They are still pro-europe, but they've done a lot of things recently to screw over the working classes, such as increase income tax for people on low incomes.

The Liberal Demorcrats are 'the third party', they could probably be described as 'centre-left', they have never been in power. Their polices are generally pro-eu, more open on immigration, encourage higher taxes for the rich, lower taxes for the poor, more public services, high investment in education, the environment, healthcare and having a smaller military (they were the only party to oppose the iraq war). They also happen to be the only party with any common sense when it comes to things like science funding, the digital economy bill (which they opposed and would repeal) and drug laws (they would separate them from government so classification was determined by experts and not politicians).

The lib dems have always been fairly popular, the percentages in the 2005 election were L:35.3% C:32.3% LD:18% but due to the way the voting system works and some tactical constituency margin changes by labour they get very few seats, in the last election it was L:356 C:198 LD:62 in terms of seats.

Lots of people don't vote for the lib dems because they 'tactically vote' there was a video on here a few days ago that said that at some point in the early 90s if everyone who wanted to see the lib dems in government voted for them they would have got 50% of the vote. I've always been voting for them, like a loser, and they never get anywhere, but this year a lot of people seem to be believing that they can get in and so are planning on voting for them.

A few reasons for this that I can think of:

* Nick Clegg is the first really good leader they've had in a while
* The TV debates (which are new) have given them a lot of exposure, most of the press don't cover the party as its easy to ignore them. - Only the Guardian and the Independent really cover them.
* Labour have been shambolic in many ways, but a lot of people voted for them because they didn't want to vote tory, but now the lib dems are looking like they could force a hung parliament, so people think they should give them a go.

Personally I'm not really sure why its taken people so long to start taking them seriously their policies are in my opinion excellent, the only thing I don't agree with them on is that they don't want to invest in more Nuclear Power, that said, they take a realistic view with regards sustainable energy and their energy policy is much better thought out than either of the other 2 parties, so I can live with that.",0,1272011681,null,0,true,0,c0oos6z,t3_buret,t1_c0oos6z,t1_c0oo9w7,null,1426284965,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Oh, *really*?

Go check out the long raging canon debate on the GallifreyBase forums sometime.  After hundreds of pages, they can't even agree on a definition of the word, much less what fall inside (or outside) it's purview.

By the dictionary definition of the word ""canon,"" Doctor Who doesn't have one - the BBC specifically refuses to declare *anything* canon or not-canon, and the fanbase can't agree enough to form an authoritative consensus.

RTD went on record multiple times as stating that he didn't really give any thought to the word, but some have cited one interview (in which he said, ""I couldn't make it *canon*!"") to conclusively imply that he believes that there is a canon.

I think there are a lot of people who would be surprised to hear someone discounting the cartoons (unless you're just referring to the never-made Nelvana series) - Both The Infinite Quest and Dreamland were made by the BBC, broadcast on TV by the BBC, and starred the main cast of the live-action series, and are marketed on DVD by the BBC as part of the TV series.

Not to mention that it might get up [Big Finish's](http://www.bigfinish.com) nose to say that their output ""isn't canon.""

Remember, just because one story contradicts another, doesn't mean that they can't both be canon.  Doctor Who is a time travel show, where history is presented as being malleable and in flux.  There is no such thing as a contradiction in such a narrative model.

The Liberals and Social Democrats merged eventually to become the Liberal Democrat party, who as far as I know traditionally represent the Centre-left/Centre people, whilst Labour are Centre-Right and Conservatives are almost the same as Labour but slightly more Right.

As far as history goes, Labour and the Liberal Democrats/original Liberal party had very similar grass roots foundations. Both represented the same people.

The current wildcard is immigration. People across the country have an opinion on it and however you play it will make the extra votes count. The War and the troops is a second wildcard.

Ashdown - Before my (voting) time so I don't really know that much about him,

Kennedy - His popularity was generally because the the Lib Dem's stance on the Iraq war rather than him personally, having said that he was a good leader I really liked him but being an alcoholic is never going to make you do amazingly in an election.

Campbell - People thought he was too old, didn't have the support of the party, was never going to go well.

Clegg - What you seem to need in a leader to win an election, basically a Tony Blair. I don't really like it but it seems to be the way it is. The Tories got Cameron in to be like Blair (young and 'fresh faced' oh ha!) and Gordon is looking pretty out of it in terms of percentage at least, so it appears to get the public to like you, you don't need good policies, you need a Tony Blair clone.

I've had a fair bit to drink here so I apologise in advance for any mistakes I make.

Economics is not a pure science no. Nor is any number of topics which I imagine you would happily believe that the 'experts' know what they're doing.

I consider myself a mathematician. In this respect even the pure sciences are 'inferior' if you were to rate their logical 'purity'. Economics is just further along the scale but no less valid; it is impossible to generate meaningful conclusions regarding the subject using the scientific method just as it is impossible to generate meaningful conclusions in, say, Physics by just taking arbitrary axioms and applying logic.

I apologise for being possibly rude and insulting, but it seems that the groupthink effect in Reddit leads to the belief that *science* is somehow superior to all other academic disciplines. The scientific method is merely the approach of finding the theories which maximise the accuracy when predicting future events using the same initial conditions. This *cannot* be applied to economics because we cannot have control experiments.

Your assertion that economists are somehow inferior because they are not science is absolute shit. Its less pure, yes, but that is a problem with the nature of the problem, not the technique. Economists are some of the most intelligent people I have ever met. Economists are not idiots, in fact I'd hazard a guess that most postgrad level economics students are a damn sight more intelligent than yourself. I apologise for being rude, but I honestly feel you've been deeply unfair here, based upon some kind of false superiority complex.

Economics is what is termed a social science. Its much *harder* than a true science because you cannot enforce the same kind of rigid initial conditions in your experiments which enable you to make rock solid conclusions.

Things to consider:

It is assumed that each colour represents a role (science, tactical, etc) with more specificity than previous Daleks which implies an even more rigid stratification of Dalek society. Is each colour a separate 'race,' genetically designed for one discipline? Are the new Daleks even more incapable of adaptation? Are they even organic, anymore?

But, after waiting in the most disorganised queue system I have seen for three hours, Jet Airways told us we'd been bumped to the next flight. Gave us our boarding passes and told us to come back tomorrow morning.

I appreciate that we were incredibly lucky with the booked flight, but they offered us absolutely no incentive to accept this, no apology, no offer to pay for the taxi back into the city and back to the airport later. Nothing.

So I complained and shouted at every Jet Airways official I could find, demanding an explanation as to why they'd stolen our seats and, just for fun, accusations of them being bribed. Pretty much just hedging for free stuff like borez said.

Instead, half an hour after the flight was supposed to have left, they took me aside, ripped up our boarding passes, issued new ones for the flight we were meant to have got, hurried us through security and on the plane.

And there were still two other free seats that we noticed on the flight.

Whilst getting the next flight, ordinarily, I would have been happy enough to.

&gt;Clegg was born in Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire, in 1967, the third of four children. His half-Russian father, Nicholas Clegg CBE, is chairman of United Trust Bank,[1]  and is a trustee of The Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation,[2]  where Ken Clarke was an advisor.[3]  Clegg's paternal grandfather, Hugh Anthony Clegg was the editor of the British Medical Journal for 35 years.[4]  Clegg's great-great-grandfather, the Russian nobleman Ignaty Zakrevsky, was attorney general of the imperial Russian senate.[5]  His great-great aunt was the writer, Baroness Moura Budberg.[6]


&gt;Clegg was educated at the private Caldicott School at Farnham Royal in South Buckinghamshire, and later at the private Westminster School in London


&gt;He spent a gap year as a ski instructor in Austria, and as an office junior in a Helsinki  bank, before attending Robinson College, Cambridge.

She strikes me as close, but not *too* close. It might be just a feeling, between the way she documented their time together and the information she doesn't have...

&gt; It is not the Liberal Democrat policy to decriminalise drugs but to follow scientific advice as the Telegraph article makes clear.

So the story is actually spinning up the fact that Clegg, as an MEP was supportive of some aspects of drug decriminalisation. Good for him, and fuck the Tory press for making a mountain out of this particular molehill. There are plenty of sound and rationally-based arguments for decriminalisation. For one thing, you end up with less criminals, and for another you can move the supply of drugs away from gangsters, the Mafia etc. Moreover, as enthusiasts of the decriminlisation of Marijuana and ecstacy never tire of telling us, these drugs are demonstrably less dangerous than tobacco and alchohol.

The thing is that it can be spun in the press to *look bad* and these bastards will do *anything* to fuck Clegg over. They are really panicing.

There are far bigger issues at stake anyway. In particular the illegal and outrageous way in which we were dragged into a war in Iraq, which was supported by both Labour and the Tories. We're now at war in Afghanistan and if that has nothing to do with controlling opium production (which was more or less shut down by the Taliban) then I'll eat my hat.

I am utterly disgusted with the corruption, lies and filth that is endemic in the ranks of both Labour and Conservative. I am appalled by the corrupt and sleazy way in which Murdoch and his drones are attempting to sabotage the election in favour of their new puppet Cameron and the duplicitous manner in which they have parted company with Labour, who they are largely responsible for placing in No.10 in the first place.

So, while I'm sure Clegg would turn out to also be a fucking poiltician if he won the election, I support him 100%.

Next they'll say he fucks babies, just you wait.

She's so convinced that she knows and loves the Doctor and that she was meant to meet him that she's willing to get on that ship and carve a Gallifraen message into the black box... because if she's wrong, if she fails this job, she'd rather die in space than return to prison.

She's pot committed.

If you're the Doctor, and you don't love her, you still have to follow her summons because she's screwing up time JUST so you will come to her side.

In that manner, she could be his Nemesis who eventually does become his lover.

By your last point, even if she was purely his nemesis... she couldn't have had the life and adventures she did if the Doctor dies at that moment.

true,citizenfaith,scottish,"Edinburgh raised, Glasgow residing","I don't take any illegal drugs but I do believe all drugs should be legal for pragmatic and also ideological reasons. 

On the pragmatic front legalisation and control would eliminate many of the medical risks associated with drug taking, take away a huge amount of power and money from organised criminals, prevent a lot of petty crime associated with drug addiction, make it easier to keep drugs out of the hands of minors, stop the criminalisation of huge numbers of otherwise law abiding citizens and give the police and courts enormous amounts of time to focus on more important matters. 

Equally importantly, ideologically I am completely opposed to the government, or any other authority for that matter, deciding what I can and can't do to my own body so long as I'm not harming anyone else. That they would ban me from and chase me and punish me for choosing to do something to myself in the privacy of my own home which affects nobody else at all is unfair, unreasonable and unjust. 

I realise however that for some unfathomable reason this is a deeply unpopular view and it would be political suicide for any politician to hold it. So yes I still support Clegg as his policies on drugs are sensible and achievable in the short term and come the closest to my own.

Legalising some drugs will put the responsibility back into the hands of parents and adults to teach their kids about drugs and how to use them safely and responsibly, instead of sitting back and letting society raise their kids for them. It's a step in the right direction. Instead of getting 50% drugs, 50% who knows, you can guarantee a safe supply and wipe out organised drug trade overnight.

Seems like I'm alone in rating ""The Beast Below"" higher than ""The Eleventh Hour"". While I could've voted either way (they are pretty close to one another, after all), ""The Beast Below"" had one of the two best Doctor scene of all four episodes (where he's furious for having to kill the space whale, and his realization that he couldn't call himself ""the Doctor"" anymore), and Amy finally proves to be a good companion (after severely disappointing the Doctor, no less).

The Dalek episode was surprisingly clever (Daleks building the scientist, Jammy Dodger, ...), especially for a Dalek episode, so although it's rated last, I still enjoyed it quite a bit.

""The Girl in the Fireplace"": Good one shot episode that has good monsters, deals well with the use of time passing, has a nice love story, and the ending nicely ties up the story but still sort of doesn't, which I like.

""Fear Her"": Another good standalone story that doesn't link to much else, has an interesting monster, properly scary, good foreshadowing ending that might pique curiosity.

It is very likely that only pushy middle class parents are going to have  the time, skill and inclination to set up their own schools. It's doubtful that very many children on free school meals will attend such schools. And even worse, the money for these schools will be taken out of the local authority budgets, so the remaining schools (with the free school meal children) will wind up even worse.

It's hardly surprising considering a large section of the Tory party is hard-core Thatcherite with fairly illiberal social views that an attempt to appeal to move towards the centre ground in tone, while not in substance was going to please no one, and appear hollow.

The ""Cameron Project"" if it could be called something so grand, was to attempt to mask the general unelectable nastiness of his party with a charming PR gloss, and rely on the justifiable loathing of Brown and his government to drop the country into his lap.  

The trouble for the Conservatives is that the Tory parliamentary party is far to the right of most of the country, and if their true political views are expressed too loudly, they get the sort of vote that William Hague or Michael Howard achieved.

I spend maybe 4-5 hours a day studying and my friends do double that, I have a quality of life here which is amazing and the facilities and location to do pretty much anything with some great peoplee. 

I think I'm trying to say that, if you feel very career motivated, you really want to be the best of the best and work hard and then leave uni straight into a top company then the best degree is probably what you should go for, remember though that what you think you want for yourself and your future now (such as your thoughts on law courses or graphics) are probably going to be different when you graduate in a few years time. For myself though I chose to pick a more balanced lifestyle, where I can study and enjoy myself without too much stress or pressure. It might just be me but I find Manc to be special, the people and the nightlife are something you won't find anywhere else, and a few years down the line it's my friends who always want to come to Manc to meet up, rather than me going to visit them.

I think part of enjoying Doctor Who is knowing the whole narrative, even if you haven't seen every episode.  I've seen all of Tom Baker - well, almost all because I can't bring myself to watch Logopolis for sadness to see him go - and all of the new series so far, but the smattering of other episodes from the various doctors adds so much depth.

If she decides she likes the show, in spite of your second update, you should encourage her to watch old series episodes containing his major enemies - Daleks, Cybermen, Sontarans, The Master, etc - and a couple episodes based on Gallifrey.  

You might also want to expose your friend to some of the doctor's best companions and allies.  I know we all often differ in opinion about who they were, but I suggest a K9/Romana arc.  While campy, K9 is cute and often saves the day.  Romana is a far more useful companion than SJS, but doesn't fall into the strong and stupid stereotype that Leela does.

An enormous deficit which if ignored will turn the UK into Greece with its public sector wage cuts, pension cuts, strikes and civil disorder.

From the article:

&gt;By 2014-15 the Conservatives would need to find cuts of nearly £64 billion a year, Labour almost £51 billion and the Liberal Democrats almost £47 billion. 

&gt;But no party had come ""anywhere close"" to identifying where these savings would be made. The Liberal Democrats had identified about a quarter, the Conservatives less than a fifth and Labour about an eighth, according to Mr Chote. 

&gt;The IFS also criticised the parties for making ""misleading"" claims that spending reductions could be met through efficiency savings. 

All the parties need to be honest about the need for deficit reduction and what they would do about it. Otherwise after the election, when the tax rises and cost cutting hit home, voters will feel conned. 

Rather than misleading the public about the huge task ahead, the election should be an opportunity to engage the public in this issue. Now is the time they should be able to choose between alternative strategies to deal with the problem, rather than being presented with a collusion of silence on the issue.

The move takes 3.6 million people out of tax and gives savings to all other income tax payers. If we are entering the toughest round of public spending cuts for decades, he says, you have to “sugar the bitter pill”.

It’s just not on to constantly tell people it’s pain, pain, pain without some fairness and gain on the other side.”**

This is the best attempt I've seen by any of the parties to warn the electorate of the pain ahead and to try and engage the population in the enormity of the problem. If there must be an enormous program of tax hikes and spending cuts, the public must be forewarned and onside. To do otherwise in an election before hand is just plain dishonest, and risks the unrest we had in the 1980s and Greece is going through now.
