I have issue with this:

&gt;The other contrast is between Assange and the marine from Hue. We don't know the marine's name or whether he survived the battle and went home to Michigan or Minnesota or Maine. We don't know whether he was against the war or for it.
We do, however, know that he fought with honour for his country, a noble and edifying act. The US marine in 1968 and the British chaplain in 2009 offer examples of behaviour that Assange and those who worship him might do well to contemplate.

From Wikipedia

&gt;The Battle of Huế during 1968, was one of the bloodiest and longest battles of the Vietnam War (1959–1975). The Army of the Republic of Vietnam and three understrength U.S. Marine Corps battalions attacked and defeated more than 10,000 entrenched People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF, also known as, Viet Cong) guerilla forces.

For what gain? For whose benefit? He fought with honour for what? A war that achieved exactly nothing good, and destroyed millions of lives. What honour is in that?

Assange is just as brave as that soldier, and this article is just trying to discredit the power that Wikileaks is wielding.",0,1282516308,null,0,false,0,c0xfwgn,t3_d46v0,t1_c0xfwgn,t3_d46v0,null,1426433418,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

A tactic learned from the Israelis, who have more experience dealing with suicide bombers. Repeated shots to the head prevent the suicide bomber from detonating his device upon arrest.

The fact that Menezes was not running away, was not challenged, and was shot several times at close range, in the head, with dum dums is all completely immaterial. It is the right thing to do when you have someone you believe to be a suicide bomber. 

The real fuck-up was that Menezes had been mis-identified by someone else. Had this not happened, or had he not gotten on public transport that day, he'd still be alive. From your link:

&gt; An officer on duty at Scotia Road, referred to as 'Tango Ten' in some reports on the incident, and as 'Frank' in Stockwell One, compared the suspect, Menezes to the CCTV photographs of the bombing suspects from the previous day, and felt he warranted further attention. However, as he was answering a call of nature, he was thus unable to immediately film the suspect to transmit images to Gold Command, the Metropolitan Police (""Met"") operational headquarters for major incidents. It was reported at the time,[6]  and later confirmed in the inquest transcript,  that 'Tango Ten' was an undercover soldier. On the basis of Tango Ten's suspicion, **Gold Command authorised officers to continue pursuit and surveillance, and that the suspect was to be prevented from entering the Tube system.**

So basically, he was killed because someone had to take a piss.

&gt; They occurred over a 30 second period.

And from your wikipedia link..

&gt; One witness claimed that the shots were evenly distributed over a timespan of thirty seconds. However this has not been substantiated by other witness reports or the leaked IPCC documents.

I think doing bad in your First Year will only really affect your internship possiblities in 2nd year, but still recommend you try to do well in them.

Oxbridge degrees work differently to other places. You don't get an overall grade for your degree; you get graded each year. This means that most people probably only quote their 3rd Year result on their CVs. Despite this everyone is far more competitive here than at any other uni where their 1st year grade matters.

Also, apply for an internship ASAP - get your CV written now while you still have free time. [Guide on how to write it and some examples](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/teaching/indexp/current_ug.html). Do all the prep problems in the blue booklet you've been given before getting to Cambridge too. I did a UROP and thought it was amazing. They only start appearing in Easter term though, so will only be an option for if you don't have a job sorted by then.

Make sure you get enough sleep each night. I thought I could get away with 6 hours per night for a long time, but it meant I wasn't able to pay attention in lectures. I need 8-9hours sleep to be able to learn properly the next day. I still don't get 8-9, but I try my best and maybe get 7-8 most days, 6 hours one night a week, and have a lie in on Sunday.

If you have a desk facing out of a window in your room, and you want to get work done in your room, then move the desk so that it faces a blank wall. 

In term time I probably will limit internet/reddit activity to 15mins a day. Priorities are work, rest/sleep and social activities.

This can be solved by working on a library computer or by downloading all the files you need and then disconnecting from the internet.

Then if it hits someone it dumps all the energy into *that* person, instead of passing through them and hitting two or more people who were not targets.

Look, there are a number of choices here, think about it logically.

1) Do not use hollow points - worst case scenario for a single bullet; a suspect is shot at, the bullet misses and strikes a bystander, the bullet then passes through that bystander (killing them) and hits another bystander (killing them), and so on until the bullet either runs out of kinetic energy or hits no more bystanders.

2) Use hollow points - worst case scenario for a single bullet; a suspect is shot at, the bullet misses and strikes a single bystander, killing them. 

You're telling me you'd increase the likelihood of killing bystanders by picking the weapon most likely to hit as many bystanders as possible?

&gt; The first conclusion that a hollow point bullet is designed for maximum damage not collateral damage is not erroneous.

It is erroneous because your conclusion was that a hollow point was **selected for use because it is deadly**. This isn't true. The hollow point was **selected for use because it doesn't pass through the target**.

This problem gets worse when your using SS109 rounds. A JHP round lacks a jacketed tip, so when it hits something it will deform and energy the round is carrying will dissipate into the deformation rather than maintain its velocity. So if you miss with a JHP and it hits a thin wall its far more likely to be stopped, or loose a lot of its energy (thus rendering it less lethal) than a FMJ round which will travel beyond the wall. This is simplified but basic ballistics. 

What your getting wrong is your understanding of how bullets cause damage. A JHP round is designed to deform when it hits a person, which causes more cavitation in the person as the round expands. This means the bullet is less likely to exit the person, and more likely to dump its entire energy into causing a wound. Thus, it has more stopping power as the wound is more serious. A FMJ round will retain its shape (to a higher degree) and loose less energy, thus it is more likely to travel through a person and over-penetrate.

The Met basically tried to shut out the IPCC. Something they have absolutely zero right to do. Lets be clear, they tried to obstruct the mechanism of justice in this country. Their wilful failure to co-operate with the IPCC is equivalent to me refusing to co-operate with a police officer with a court warrant in an investigation. Their tampering with the crime scene is like me going to a crime scene and playing with the evidence. As far as the police are concerned the IPCC are their police. The principles that apply to us when working with the police apply to the police when working with the IPCC. They did not co-operate with the investigators and tampered with evidence they had no business touching.

The labs are mainly to illustrate principles from the lectures, so pay attention while you're doing the practical work but don't spend much time on writing up.
3. Always remember that even though you'll probably have four or five 9 a.m. lectures a week, it could be worse; you could be a NatSci and have lectures on Saturdays as well. Don't skip the lectures; you'll regret it. I skipped some, and I regretted it.

One thing I'm always fascinated by is the different understandings of something like Monty Python that Brits and Americans tend to have. Obviously I'm generalising here but many American Python fans seem to mainly notice the silliness and zany surrealism of Python. Brits love that too, but we also love the deep satirical intent of Python - something which seems to fly right over many Americans' heads. Evidence for that? See how often an American Python fan says ""Oh, I love British humour... Python, Benny Hill, Are You Being Served...""

And when we Brits see that, we roll our eyes. Because we wouldn't ever think of lumping those three together. It's like all such fans see is that Python, Hill and Are You being Served are all a bit silly, a bit whoops-a-daisy that's-a-bit-naughty, vicar. They've missed the point. Most British Python fans HATE Benny Hill for the sniggering, dated, naughty-postcard smut-peddler he was.

Python was clever, multi-layered and satirical. Take ""The Ministry of Silly Walks"". Oh look, a city gent, all bowler hat and pinstripes, walking down the street like a clown.  Very silly. Very funny for being so silly and incongruous and clown-like. But that seems to be about as far as many non-Brits get. They totally miss the point that the sketch was satirising pointless, costly, wasteful government spending.

I'd say that would be one useful avenue to pursue. Another would be to look at why Brit humourists like to be outrageously, ironically offensive.

It doesn't matter what happens in the world - tsunamis, Katrinas, 9/11, bombings on the London Tube... without fail people are in the pub that night cracking terrible jokes about it.

The maintenance loan doesn't even cover rent (at least not in a reasonably expensive city like Exeter).

I too hate the idea that I'd be paying an indefinite tax to pay for those who studied useless degrees.

A slight issue though is that research is also funded from public funds and as such the funding is very low (due to hostility towards taxes, it isn't as bad on the continent) this means that the money is needed for the science to get done and so the salaries for researchers (and often the job security also) are extremely poor relative to the amount of work and education required.

This could perhaps be better solved by increasing funding and perhaps restructuring how research is funded and carried out than merely subsidising degrees. But if you have people with science degrees and interest payments to meet (albeit extremely low interest) then why would they take a PhD stipend of £12k which will leave their debts to grow and them to work long hours for little financial reward when they can just as easily work in the City if they did Engineering or Maths or Physics etc.?

If you have trouble finding work in the USA, expect it to be much more difficult here as you can not even fall back on your social network for help, as you will not know anybody.

Outside of London, where the cost of living is ""low"" (where low is actually much more expensive than in the USA) - is a 2 hour commute each way to London, expect to spend 4 hours on the train each day. 

However, housing is much more flexible here than in the USA. Things are furnished by law if they are for rent, and getting one unfurnished is a bit more tricky. It is quite common for people to split up a house with 4-6 rooms, and share the house. Not great when you are a couple - but a great way to meet people and save a lot of money if you are single or flexible. 

Life here is so radically different that it is quite difficult to compare really. For example, in England you get Healthcare, and 132 days off from work per year. I really love it here. People are much more friendly and there is so much more culture everywhere. 

I took everything from the USA with me, I wish I had sold everything and only taken some clothes and maybe a laptop. Everything else is better purchased here; since most things from the USA are to large for the small houses, and the electronics work but require adapter. TV's don't work and neither do the DVD players (wrong region) - rip the DVD's you want to keep and reburn region free / same with music and video games.

true,Elanthius,english,London,"If you're looking for jobs in the UK investigate British resumes, they are quite different from American. For example an American resume will be one page or maybe two at worst whereas a British one can go on for 5 or 6 pages. Also in Britain you should use proper sentences and paragraphs in your resume rather than clipped bullet points.

You might find cultural differences make it difficult for you to interview for a job with a British firm. Try to be less boastful and more self deprecating. Try to avoid being funny because you might find your jokes don't go down as well as you expected. British people already find American accents kind of annoying so its an uphill battle before you start. I've known several Americans who moved to the UK and they had a terrible time trying to get jobs here. That said, they do all actually have jobs now so it's not impossible.

As mentioned elsewhere don't bring much stuff, your furniture won't fit in your house and its usually easier to rent furnished than unfurnished.

I would not suggest living too far outside of London since travel times will be miserable. Someone below here said that you could get a place for 150 a week. I guess it depends if you want to live in a tiny shithole or not. If you want a 2 bedroom place within about 10 miles of the center of London expect to pay at least £250 per week. Londoners typically spend 50% of their take home on their home. 

Having said that there are some typical commuter towns you can live in like Ashford or Brighton where your journey time will be about 90 minutes or less if you work near the right train station. If your office is on the other side of London and your train comes into the wrong station though you're looking at 2 hour commutes.

Learn to drink. British people socialise around drinking where Americans socialise around food. Americans generally hate British food but you just need to embrace pub grub and accept you'll never get a decent steak again.

As mentioned don't buy a car, the underground in London is truly amazing and by far the most convenient way to get around.

Be prepared for it to get dark super early, like 5pm in the winter. You'll pretty much never get home from work during daylight for about 2-3 months. Depending on where you're from you might find this depressing.

If you go to a hardware store take a friend because almost everything has a different name.

Bureaucracy can be pretty frustrating. You'll find British companies aren't that interested in helping you. Even when you beg them to take your money in exchange for the service they are selling you will often find that ""the rules"" or ""the system"" block you. Getting a phone number, dealing with the mail, getting an ISP, buying any large item - you will probably find all these things incredibly frustrating. It's probably best to just remain relaxed and let things grind along and not get too upset when you get ripped off and no-one gives a shit.

Take your holidays. Americans get 2 weeks vacation and tend to not even take all of that. Here you'll get 4 weeks at an absolute minimum. Use it all and travel to Europe with it. Best thing about living in England is you're only a couple of hours away from France, Italy, Germany, Spain etc etc etc. You can literally get on the train and go to Paris, Brussels, Bruges, Amsterdam for the weekend.

Again, no. As with any job interview anywhere else, employers will favour confidence - a job interview isn't the place to be self deprecating. While 'boasting' is going too far (as it would do probably anywhere), don't be afraid to talk yourself up, because no-one else is going to do it for you.

The poster seems to be under the false impression that you can only eat out at pubs. There are plenty of great restaurants around, that are more than capable of cooking you a decent steak. 'Pub grub' are the meals sold in pubs. They're meant to be cheap, cheerful and plentiful - not fine dining.

'Dealing' with the mail? It's just stamps and postboxes, hardly something to 'deal' with.

I have had a number of clients freaked when giros went from weekly to fortnightly and they were scared that the could not budget for the kids over that stretch, but they soon learned and calmed down. 

On the other hand I spent 4 hours interviewing a guy on Monday who wandered in off the street, trying to untangle his benefits. Turned out that he missed a medical because of his mental health problems (paranoia and hears voices so cannot use public transport) and they stopped his Incapacity Benefit/Income Support without listening to his explanation about why he had missed the appointment. He then lost his Housing &amp; Council Tax Benefit as a result and owes them money. He now has rent arrears and a notice that they will be seeking to evict him. He has been living on what he can borrow since May with no income and was unable to challenge the DWP to prevent this whole cascade in the first place. Hopefully I can untangle it for him. He may be an extreme example but there are plenty of vulnerable people out there that can barely manage their benefits, whether through mental health problems, learning disabilities or just very poor life skills.

Firstly, your CV advice is flat out wrong, if you want to get a job, keep the CV to 2 pages, unless you're actually fully awesome and can fill 4 pages with amazing jobs. Also, bullet points all the way, maybe a paragraph here or there, saying why you want the job, but skills, experience etc. All bullet points.

On the interview front, don't be self deprecating, I have never been to an interview in the USA, but basically in the UK, they're looking 1. that you know your stuff 2. that you can learn more stuff 3. that you're a good guy to work with. So if you go in all arrogant and twattish then of course they're going to think 'this guy is a tosser' but just point out what you've done, and move on to your next achievement, if its relevant to the job they will be able to add the superlatives themselves. - But yes the job market in the UK is proper shit at the moment. 

Secondly, I don't like your food remarks.
I was in California for several months, and I thought the food was pretty bad, well actually, it started off great, burgers and steaks are wonderful, but aside from 'the grill' and mexican there is nothing interesting, and almost every restaurant is a chain, which seems to only drive down standards, and every restaurant that isn't a chain just sells the same food. Maybe its that everyone likes the food from their home, but to be honest, I don't even eat any 'british' food, find me a good curry in LA? In the UK there's a curryhouse on every corner!

*Under-claimed Benefits &amp; % of people who do not claim*

- Incapacity Benefit &amp; Jobseekers	£1,350 million	45%

- Pension Credit	£130 million	1.9%

- Housing Benefit	£100 million	0.7%

These were official DWP estimates.""


This may not be a popular view, but I believe that having a certain percentage of fraud is one indicator of the effectiveness of a benefits system. At zero percent fraud then the system is so restrictive and draconian that too many genuine claimants will be put off or will be unable to claim and the financial overheads per claimant in terms of administration and policing will be intolerably high. At too high a percentage of fraud people lose faith in the system and politically it starts to collapse.

The current problem is that at the moment the right wing press, fed misleading stats by the government are driving us to the belief when we are in the latter position, when in fact we are not. Fraud is not the massive problem it is made out to be, and the figures have been dropping.

true,Kim147,uk,British Sandgroper,"I'm a contractor - a Brit who grew up in Oz and came back 18 years ago . I have lived in London and have worked all around Britain and on the Continent . So here's my tuppence worth :-
C.V.'s - I suggest you look at my web site for a good example :-
http://wrldcomp.com/staff/kl/index.html - particularly look at the .doc version - it's basically the same but it's what the agents ask for . The thing with the C.V. is that it must , basically , have :-
1) a summary of you as a person .
2) a summary of your skills .
3) a list of your work , dates , where you worked , what you worked as , what you worked on - what you achieved , the technologies that you used , and for Continental purposes - whether you were extended . Don't be vague !
4) a particularly British requirement - details of your interests - I always found this went against my professional grain .

Ref. the village pub - yes the life of the village does revolve around it - go to the pub - meet the people - generally they will be warm and accepting . However avoid the few places - usually in the city centers - where it's just drunken louts .

Ref. the food - can be ghastly but can often be good - just a matter of going to the right places . Britain tends to be more of a lamb country ( beef too expensive ) whereas France tends to be more of a beef country . France is certainly good for food but as with anywhere - get off the beaten track , explore and find out where the good cheap places are . I would strongly recommend avoiding the McDonalds , Burger Kings , Pizza Huts &amp; KFC's - the good local food is always so much better and usually cheaper - especially like for like .

London - use public transport . Out of London - a push bike or a car or public transport - depending on where you are and what your finances are like . The Underground is often the only practical way to travel around London .

Britain has changed a lot over the last decade plus and it is not necessarily all good - you will find much discussion about that . However generally speaking :-
1) as far as I know - the Brits think for themselves more than the Americans - they expect the brain to be engaged .
2) they expect subtle - civilised - behavior - not loudness . Politeness and civility go a long way .
3) they look at the facts rather than the PR &amp; spin . Understatement and self deprecation are important .
4) they expect reasoned argument and differing opinion .
5) it is not a conforming society - as I understand the USA is .
6) they believe in quality and depth of character .
Having said that the country is diverse - many different types of people and different landscapes - so like any country - explore and find out .

London is different than the surrounding counties and further out - it is much more international . London also has many localised areas .

Crime wise - keep your wits about you and be sensible . But don't go armed - get to know the local laws and mores - and it's different on the Continent . There are things that you can get away with as precautions but be careful . Crime is usually not a problem . It's mainly robbery . Certainly not gun crime .

Work is spread throughout Britain . With the exception of the financial industry most work is located in many places throughout the country .

Petrol costs a lot £1.20 +\- 0.05 pL typically . Wages are down and prices are up . The economy is picking up however we are not completely out of the woods yet .

Personally - I hate the corporates - the Tescos of this world . Consequently I find a lot of good suppliers - shops etc. - and a lot of good places to eat and drink . However I have traveled a lot and built up this knowledge over the years .

Mobile phone - very important - you can buy outright and pay as you go . Alternately if you have a UK account set up you may be able to set up a direct debit , take out an 18 month contract and get a phone included . http://vodafone.co.uk .

Post - I use a redirection - mail forwarding - service . There are many around . https://www.4business.com/ .

You can get cheap accommodation in Paddington and Bayswater . However it's often much cheaper out of London for most things .

Bring a laptop . The radio is going over to DAB - digital - but there is still plenty of FM ( with RDS ) and some AM . T.V. is largely digital - Freeview . These , except small devices , are best sourced locally . DVD's are region encoded but you can get non region restricted DVD players quite easily - Argos is certainly a good place to go . Also - a high capacity ( eg. 1TB ) HDD or SSD is another way to go - but photograph the sides of the DVD's for customs ( if they ask ) . A USB stick is a very useful thing to have - I , like a lot of contractors , take one with me onto the client's site for bringing my various private and company details - email addresses , time sheets , correspondence etc. - with me .

Agencies - there are many of them . Jobs :-

PS - and use 's' not 'z' and it's zed not zee . But like a lot of things it will be a learning experience .

And - on a completely different note - be aware that Europeans , particularly Continentals , have a different set of views and approaches to morality issues and relationships . It's all very well reasoned out . On my part I largely prefer the Continental approach - it makes much more practical sense than the Anglo approach and it deals with the issues rather than ignoring them and sweeping them under the carpet . However take it easy - get to know things first .

true,StormingPolaris,null,null,"I was once watching a cop show on television (it might have been The Wire), where a more experienced cop was telling a less experienced one that it was far better for a cop to be all business and emotionally disengaged from crimes which resulted in human tragedy: that the family of the victim didn't need a friend in the cop, nor was it in the cop's best interest to become involved that way.

Instead, the idea was that the cop could do his job dispassionately and scientifically, which would lead to the best possible resolution.  I thought about this for awhile and it makes a lot of sense.  At least, this is how I want police to conduct their affairs.

Joe Arpaio is a treacherous menace to law and order, no matter how he markets himself.  I would say that he appeals to the basest instincts in Americans, but this is unfair to Americans.  Rather, he appeals to the basest instincts of the type of Americans that make up the redneck stereotype.

What I would like, is to see a lot more checks and balances on people like him, and however you feel about democracy, categorizing anything Arpaio does as ""democratic local policing,"" while in some sense objectively true, is a lot like describing a toilet as containing ""organic matter.""

Democracy only really guarantees majority rule.  It guarantees nothing for minorities.

I am not British but as an American, if I ever moved to Britain, I would counsel people in earnest that while democratic local policing is a nice sounding thing, it is fraught with considerable problems if having an objective, businesslike police force (you want this) is a goal.

Law enforcement, like war, is one of those things I wish was treated with reluctance - how terrible it is that we need to have people empowered to do this, and that it is indeed a tragedy that we need police at all.  Arpaio, on the other hand, postures like a rock star, gaining points with his followers the more abuse he heaps on prisoners.

Not good.  Not good for America.  Potentially (though less so) double plus ungood for the UK.

This costs me £20 a month. What I like about this deal is you can go into the store and haggle an upgrade. The contracts can be terminated with a months notice so when I see better offers from either my provider or a competitor I threaten to terminate the contract (not in any kind of threatening or aggressive way) and it seems to be very easy to get your contract upgraded to match. The guy/gal just clicks away and things happen.

I think because you can cancel the contract so easily the providers would rather you paid them less than you do now than pay them nothing and help the competition.

18 month contracts are a rip off, 6 months in it's out done by new contracts, the phones out dated and you're still paying premium for what is now second rate service/hardware.

[When the Doctor arrives at the base, he is trying to get out, while the captain of the space station wants to know everything he knows, and presses him to help save them, unless I am much mistaken. Then, when he does save her and the remaining members of the crew, she becomes holier-than-thou, telling him ""A Time Lord Victorious is a Time Lord Wrong!""](/spoiler)

[Besides, maybe it's just me, but I really felt the Doctor could have saved them without violating the fixed point in time by sneaking around it. He's bent a number of unbreakable rules in the past, so why outright break this one? He could have taken them a couple centuries in the future, or gone to a different planet, or dropped them off anywhere at any point in space and time where the earth at that time would believe they were dead. But his whole plan for solving the problem was to take them back to the Earth at that point in time.](/spoiler)

The best things that last are built on solid foundations, after a few meetings with the networking people identify the members who are doing the same as you (looking but not buying) and start to arrange your own 'mastermind' group and replace meeting with the networking people with this group, try and become the leader but defer if you find you can get someone on board who obviously has more gravitas than yourself (which you will find is the case, as long as your proposition is good).

Find a niche, fill it and learn to never spend money on anything you do not need to make more profits from what you are realising. Use these niches as building blocks.

as bowling4meth and others say, first step is knowing what you are hoping to accomplish, a walk without a map is fun, but knowing what you will see when you get from A - B is better encouragement to make the journey IMHO.

Here's what I envision: Tor is not a useful model because every exit Tor node, as long as they allow your type of traffic, becomes a valid exit point for any transaction - plus the number of Tor exit nodes are small and easily blacklisted.

But here's an alternative:

* Two flavors of the program: UK and US. The way it works is similar to at least the proxy portion of Tor: it runs in the background and for certain types of traffic, it will automatically forward your connections through a proxy to the opposite side.
* By running the program, you automatically enable connections from the other side to come through your computer - it's bi-directional traffic. (In other words, to get the benefit of watching Hulu/BBC, you have to be willing to share out BBC/Hulu to the other side).
* There would be a short whitelist of domains that the proxies would only carry traffic for those domains - just enough to get BBC iPlayer / Hulu working.
* When you fire up your program, it connects into a central tracker - similar to a torrent, registering you as an available resource for the other side to connect through. If central is a problem, can also do decentralized.
* Unlike Tor, your machine will do some quickie speed checks when connecting to a resource and attempt to ""pair"" you with one, which you'll use for a short duration (4 hours or so) before looking for another node. You will be matched with a machine with roughly the same speed as what you have to offer.

The only drawback to this method is that it relies on the downlink and uplink of any participant - which for most broadband providers are completely different speed levels. I have 16Mbit download at home, but only 1.5Mbit up - so someone proxying through me would at best be pulling down a 1.5Mbit connection to Hulu.

true,pudquick,null,null,"For the BBC, this would work. For Hulu, not so much.

The BBC iPlayer has an MP4-based interface that's accessible. If we spoof our client as mobile, we get standard http://-style content handed to us that we can do partial GET requests on, cache content, etc.

This would lend itself to the P2P method of watching very well, plus actually lower bandwidth demands on the BBC's own site.

For Hulu - they also offer MP4 ... if you're using Hulu Plus on a mobile device ... which is a paid-for service, where they track your login, etc.

For the standard free interface they use RTMPE streams through Flash Player that wrap around .flv video content (which is usually MP4 video + AAC audio).

There is a free project out there called get\_flash\_videos which is a perl wrapper around the rtmpdump command-line binary, which with the Hulu.pm plugin can actually connect to Hulu, simulate a copy of Flash Player, then download Hulu content as .flv files - which you can then re-wrap using ffmpeg + mp4box / mp4creator into standard .mp4 video files that could easily be played by any media player.

So ... it's kinda possible, just a hell of a lot more difficult. We couldn't actually do partial GETs from multiple clients to build the p2p-distributed .mp4 versions of Hulu shows/movies, but a single client could pull down the whole episode, convert it to .mp4 (no transcoding, just a container change, so no loss in quality), then the p2p side could kick in.

(If it sounds like I know too much about converting Hulu TV shows to .mp4, it's because I do.)

Not British, but check out Chopper. 

Or check out things like A Long Good Friday, Get Carter, &amp; Layer Cake. These aren't that close to Bronson, but they're quite violent in some ways. The closest film I can think of to Bronson is A Clockwork Orange, which you've probably seen. 

Comedy stuff:

In Bruges - I think this was a British/Irish production, but close enough.

Son of Rambo.

Death At A Funeral.

Horror (&amp; similar-ish):

Hush.

28 Days Later.

Hearltess.

If you want darker gritty drama type films then check out films by Ken Loach, Shane Meadows &amp; Mike Leigh. 

Kidulthood &amp; Adulthood are worth a watch too. I think Adulthood is a lot better, but you need to watch them in order. Both about teenagers &amp; their lives around London.

As for TV you should check out Blackadder - but AVOID the first series. &amp; Red Dwarf, for comedy sci-fi.

true,palehorse864,null,null,"Matt Smith is brilliant, though I kind of wish we got to see one season with Tennant and Moffat at the helm, especially if Donna came along. The warm touching scene at the end of The Beast Below would have been a bit more meaningful with The Doctor and his proclaimed ""Best Friend"". I just always liked the Doctor and Donna dynamic.  It was especially good in Midnight, even though they were separate for most of the episode. That, or the exchange after the Ood planet, where Donna talks about how horrible it was what people were doing, and the Doctor asks her if she wants to keep adventuring. She just gives a simple affirmative and they go off on their next adventure after setting things right. It reminded me of the way The Doctor always carries on in the face of terrible things. 

Though, before watching Series 4 though, or The Runaway Bride, I was thinking that  a ""best friend"" character for the Doctor would be interesting.  I had initially envisioned the character as a guy pal similar to Sam Axe from Burn Notice, Daisuke Jigen from Lupin the third, or other similar characters willing to sacrifice themselves if need be to save the hero, but also more on an equal level, perhaps getting in a fight on The Tardis (Think the ventilation shaft argument and fight on Boondock saints). If they brought the master back with his inner demons controlled, he could fill the role brilliantly for a season or so before going off on his own adventures, or leaving in some hopes of controlling his insanity.

Still, that would have probably meant Smith wouldn't get the kick off he deserves, and he's been brilliant as the Doctor.  It's too bad we can't pilfer episodes from an alternate universe or something and keep ours the same. :) Don't think I'm saying that 10 should have stayed forever, Smith is doing wonderfully in the role.

When you pass remember that indicating 2 yards from your turn it entirely pointless. Early indication is useful, late indication is about obeying the letter of the law while bypassing the intent. We'd rather you not indicate at all than do so in an entirely pointless manner. Also that not indicating at a roundabout exit during rush hour is douchebag behaviour that deserve all the pain and suffering that can possibly be applied to somebody.

True, but there were about  a million empty properties in the UK in 2007 as well, a not insignificant proportion are not considered habitable so they don't count toward supply, it would be costly to get them into a salable condition and so have a meaningful impact on housing availability and prices.

&gt;People are prepared to spend as much as they can afford because houses were going up in value. Banks offer ever more money which causes people to be able to afford ever greater amounts which causes house prices to go up.

True, but lending has dried up quite considerable, cheap mortgages (like those available in 2005-7) simply aren't as available anymore, meaning that the barriers to entry are higher, yet even with that in mind there is a significant undersupply.  Don't get me wrong, you can buy cheap houses in many parts of the country, the issue is that there hasn't been much demand in those areas for some time (usually due to local economic issues, look at parts of the North).

&gt;If we had market based interest rates the average house price would be about £70k.

I'm not entirely sure what you mean by this.  Bank of England policy has been to try and hold interest rates low and steady, but it does so through market mechanisms, no-one is dictating them.

The BOE does not do this. It mandates that basic interest rates are kept below the sensible C/S ratio. Instead they use a broken measure of inflation (one that doesn't include the primary costs of living for most families) and set interest rates to keep a fiddled metric under control.

true,ajehals,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;It isn't possible to simultaneously dictate a position and use market mechanisms.

The BoE only controls the Bank Rate.  It cannot dictate interest rates other than for BoE related interbank lending.  The idea is that if it holds interest rates down then other lenders will do the same, which in turn keeps inflation low and so on.  That isn't the only thing it does but it is one of the BoE's key roles.  That is an influence on the market, it isn't a dictat. 

Given that the Bank is independent and pulicly owned, with a mandate to provide monetary and economic stability, it would be odd if it made it's decisions based entirely on the state of market,  direction and profitability, it is supposed to be in a position to influence, and if necessary dampen moves on the markets albeit usually in a very indirect manner (although it can intervene quite directly too.).

&gt;Instead they use a broken measure of inflation (one that doesn't include the primary costs of living for most families) and set interest rates to keep a fiddled metric under control.

Yeah, this is quite daft.  I can see the point in a sense (maintaining confidence by using a tame measure..) but it harms information flow.

&gt;Regardless if there was a restriction on the amount banks can lend in mortgages the housing market would drop to a sensible value pretty quickly. 2.5 times salary seems a reasonable position.

There is something of a restriction, it simply isn't expressed as you would like it. Loans can only be made if there is a reasonable expectation that the borrower can pay.

In any case, mandating loan multiples would be just as much a non-market based intrusion on the housing market as any of the other actions we have referred to here, if not more (because it would mandate all lenders to act in a certain way).",0,1282994184,null,0,false,0,c0xwz3z,t3_d69yl,t1_c0xwz3z,t1_c0xwyk9,null,1426441478,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

As a single parent of two children six and seven I'd say that what happens on TV has little to do with reality.

As a side note there is a very popular parenting program here in the UK called The Incredible Years, I believe it's based on some American research, I attended it, it was good, all the little vignettes that they showed were of American children, all rather well behaved and precocious I might add.

I'd say that most of the children that appear in BBC programs come from middle class backgrounds, but then aren't the middle classes the new working classes, I dunno.

Personally I think it's good to bring up children to be gentlemen and gentleladies (spell checker says there is no such word.. ha!), if that means being nice to other people, treating them as you would like to be treated and all that, but then maybe I'm just a product of what you are seeing and can't see it myself what with being in it so to speak.

true,mistyriver,null,null,"I haven't heard about the ""Incredible Years"" program before. However, I just watched a ½ hour segment [here](http://www.incredibleyears.com/index.asp) about their program at work with New Zealand parents. It looks to me as if in that Kiwi program, they're taking with families where parents have lost their authority in the kids' eyes because of corporal punishment, and working hard to suggest to the parents other ways of disciplining their children - such as through setting limits. Perhaps the British version of the program was targeted at a different set of parents?

If you really want to know about academic ideas in the USA about parenting and childcare, these are two very good websites to visit:

http://loveandlogic.com/

There are generally three categories of child discipline style talked about by educators in the USA: Authoritarian, Laissez Faire, and Authoritative. Child care providers and parents are warned against the first two, and steered toward the third. The loveandlogic site talks about these.

http://www.naeyc.org/

This is a trade association website for early childhood education teachers in the USA.



&gt; In all honesty I don't quite understand what you are saying. Sorry.

What I'm saying is that this well-intentioned British idea about strictness with groups of children might actually create bad developmental effects. In the ""Evacuation Manor House"" episode, the kids have a different set of mannerisms when the videotographer is interviewing them one on one, as compared to when they are in group situations. The filmmaker seems to have taken a more disarming approach to them. There's one scene where the kids are thrushing out pheasants, and they're really hating it - they're getting briers in their clothing. The narrator blithely talks about the idea they should have a ""stiff upper lip."" In another scene, some of the kids are chosen to have a posh dinner with the neighbors of the rich couple, and the other kids sweat away in the kitchen, and are given only a baked potato for dinner. The kids who are at dinner are given a training session in very genteel behavior. However, what results from that is a very strained and artificial way of interacting. 

So, my intention of this invitation to a Reddit discusssion was to address this very British way of doing things with kids. Is it a good ideal to give children object lessons to think about in this manner? Is it good to set children out in the field and watch them scratch themselves up in the brier patch and watch them cry - and hope they take a lesson away from that? Is it good to set up a competitive environment where some kids are rewarded and others left out in the cold?

I understand that ""Evacuation Manor House"" is a program about history. However, it does illustrate that British ideal about child-rearing that parents and caregivers and teachers still think about, today, doesn't it?

I've been dismayed at watching programs like ""Young Apprentices"" where the competitive atmosphere of the situation seems to encourage arrogant outbursts from children who are simply trying to make themselves look better at the expense of how their peers are seen.

A few weeks back, I watched a reality program about British teens being sent abroad to spend a week or two with an Indian businessman family.  In that program, the kids who were chosen had a really sour attitude toward their own parents - and were very obdurate. It seemed as if in those households the parents had eventually chosen to adopt a laissez faire discipline style - where the kids are not given the kind of support and guidance they ought to have been offered. It was a shock for them to step into the authoritative household of the Indian family.

 &gt; As a single parent of two children six and seven I'd say that what happens on TV has little to do with reality.

My point was that as a person who has worked with children's theater, and has worked in many different situations with groups of kids, I can see the social dynamic which plays out in the kids' attitudes as they act. Given how the kids held themselves while they were acting, I can tell that there were a very different set of directors and producers working on series four of MI High, who had a new set of ethics when it came to working with groups of kids than those of the people who had created the earlier series.

&gt; I'd say that most of the children that appear in BBC programs come from middle class backgrounds,

Yes. In the USA, I see that people who intentionally adopt one of several parenting techniques are middle class folks. There's perhaps a more controlled observation to be had when looking at these types of families because of that. Poorer families often tend to do the best they can, and many don't have any real game plan when they start out as young parents.

&gt; Personally I think it's good to bring up children to be gentlemen and gentleladies

Yes. The question, though is how? Do we treat kids like clay to be explicitly molded on the potter's wheel, or as plants in a garden which need to be nurtured and watered and protected, but which will grow according to their own nature.

I don't think I can do anything over the counter at my local branch, or at least, that's the impression I get... as every month or so I get a letter telling me ""Our services are changing..."". 

Normally these changes mean something along the lines of ""Something you expect to be able to do in branch, you now can no longer, unless it involves £40,000,000+ or taking out high interest loans. You can of course continue to do this on-line.""

Except I can't continue to do this on-line.
Because every time I've set up my on-line banking (involving three passwords, three memorable bits of information, and a mirror to read them with), they've disabled it after 4 weeks, in case unauthorised people access it.

So then I have to go on-line again to get them to send me new passwords. Fine. Oh what's that? I've requested passwords unusually often? Well, sure I'll come in and confirm my identity and re-set my memorable information. Whilst I'm there I'll do the original transaction I wanted to do! Oh wait, no, still can't do that. I'll just go in with my driver's license, and set up my on-line banking again. Then wait a week for the new passwords to arrive.

Then my birthday comes around, and I get sent a cheque! I'll pop that in on my lunch break. Except I don't have time to do it on my lunch break. Because they have one window open, and a queue of 40 customers.

Yes I would like to use the paying in machine. If the paying machine wasn't out of order seven out of the ten times I've been in this month.

Sure it's working *now*, but I don't want to use it for the same reason I don't want to give cash to a bank teller that gets too confused to work 7 days out of 10.

I now no longer trust the machine.

true,Toffeeapple,welsh,Wales,"I don't think TV programs are a good way of looking at this, they are all about making something for people to watch, appealing to the lowest common denominator with something extrema.

Most people parent as they were parented, it is now generally accepted that hitting your child is wrong though many people still do, not may years ago it was perfectly acceptable and seen as wrong if you didn't, there is no perfect way to parent children, we don't need a set plan designed by think groups after doing a whole load of studies as they will just produce lots of people the same, or similar.

You can't let children just do what they please, I think and try to anyway, allow them to express them selves and develop within the confines of what I feel is right and wrong in a not to dissimilar way to how my parents were with me, I think this is probably true of most people even when they go out of their way to not be like heir parents, there will be many similarities I'm sure, no matter how much they deny it.

That stiff upper lip thing you mention, I think children should be made to do things they don't want to do, it's a valuable lesson in life and crying, If I didn't do all the things my kids cried about then they would eat nothing but sweets, never wash or clean their teeth and go out the house in their pyjamas or something else unsuitable. They can cry quite convincingly at the drop of a hat : ) and then be perfectly happy ten seconds latter : )

I can't really comment on any of the programs you've mentioned as I don't watch TV the little that I do is what I see on iplayer and non of it bears much resemblance to the reality of my life.

Incredible years here is generally something you are refereed to by your health visitor or social worker if you are having problems with you children. I asked to go on it as I was going through a separation and my solicitor said it would go in my favour as I'm a bloke and generally residence is given to the mother. I was initially unsure because as most parents believe I though I don't need to be taught anything about parenting and I didn't want to be lumped in with lots of parents with out of control kids as mine are quite well behaved, having gone on it I recommend it to everyone I can as it was very good and I learnt a lot.

Children are all different and all respond in different ways to different parenting methods, they basically want attention and to be in control and as a parent you have to hit some ever moving mark where discipline and freedom meet to mould them into someone who can happily function in society, there is no perfect way to do this and there is no set product to aim for at the end really, so long as they are happy and nice to the people around them, I suppose.

I don't think what you were watching on TV is something to go by, for a start it takes a certain type of attention seeking parent to push their child into being on TV in the first place and that's probably something to do with the culture of TV at the moment and all those programs where everyday people try to be famous, reality TV programs and 'talent' seeking contests that sort of stuff.

Also the people on the program, are they parents them selves? it's very easy to observe and comment on someone elses parenting when you haven't had kids your self as living with and dealing with children twenty four seven is a world apart from dealing with them for a a few hours here and there even as a teacher if you don't have kids your self you can't know.

Here too it's very middle class to adopt some mode of parenting seen on some TV program or read in a magazine, there are a few programs, one about a nanny I've heard mentioned but when I have seen them it seems to me that the child's problems stem from the parent, lack of clear boundaries not responding to inappropriate behaviour and letting it continue, children need to be shown in a way that they understand that any inappropriate behaviour is not acceptable and that there are consequences.

I've lost track of where I was going : ) I just felt it polite to respond as you wrote so much : )

You say you work in children's theatre, that sounds like fun as I'm sure watching them interact and have fun must be rewarding, much like parenting can be if you let it : )",0,1283019087,null,0,false,0,c0xxl4w,t3_d6exl,t1_c0xxl4w,t1_c0xxdsy,null,1426441766,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

_The Elm Tree_, out near the Grafton Centre, is a brilliant pub which specialises in Belgian fruit beers and lambics, but generally has all kinds of great beers going. They also have live music and story nights, and all the guys that run it are excellent. It's right next to the Cricketers, which is much less good but is open a few hours later, so we frequently start off in the Free Press or the Elm Tree and then move on to the Cricketers at closing time, when we're drunk and care less about the quality of the pub.

There's a great shisha bar called _Jaffa Net_ or something on Mill Road which looks proper sketch from the front but is actually really good, if you like shisha, which you should. It's illegal to smoke it indoors, but they have a big covered area out the back, so if it's not too cold, it's really enjoyable. They also do a line in mint tea and weird pastries.

The _Arts Picturehouse_ should be everyone's first stop for cinema in Cambridge - it's streets ahead of the Vue or Cineworld in terms of price and movie quality. It's located opposite Emma, a little further down Regent Street. The entrance is to the side of Wetherspoons, kind of tucked away. There's a nice bar, and they'll let you take booze that you buy there into the theatre with you. When I went to see Moon with my girlfriend, it turned out Stephen Hawking was in the same showing, and we passed him as we went out through the lobby.

There's a partner to CB1 out on Norfolk Street, just off east road, called _CB2_. It's more of a restaurant than CB1, but keeps the same atmosphere, has great food and live music, poetry, art and cinema. And free wifi.

I like to go sit by the pond in Emma and watch the ducks fuck about while I eat my lunch sometimes, but be warned: the porters can be dicks. Colleges with nice bits inside where I've never been hassled by porters: Downing, Trinity, King's. I'm sure there are more, but those all have nice areas to hang out inside.

The _Cambridge Waffle Company_ does delicious Belgian-style waffles, with savoury and sweet toppings, and if you're a student you can get a discount card at the little convenience stall next to it by flashing your university card. It's right next to Soul Tree.

_Nanna Mexico_ (previously Manna Mexico, until a douchebag sandwich guy in London hassled them about trademarking the word 'manna') is on Regent Street, just opposite the entrance to Downing College. It's run by a guy named Mane, who is incredibly friendly and nice, and they do fresh, delicious Mexican take-out, although they have limited seating now. I fill up a 10-item loyalty card there maybe twice a term. The burritos are the best, but the quesadillas are excellent too. Get guacamole.

Also on Regent Street, a little further south, is _Bella Napoli_, who do fantastic artisan sandwiches for reasonable prices. Very limited seating, so go eat your sandwich on Parker's Piece or on the paddock in Downing.

The _Portland Arms_ is a pub which is a little further out but is a really great music venue. Other fantastic music venues in Cambridge include the _Junction_, down towards Cherry Hinton, which has a really good line-up of bands, comedians, and other performers (including burlesque nights, occasionally). The _Corn Exchange_ has some good acts from time to time, but tends to be quite pricey.

true,spitonpigeons,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"I was at the demo yesterday (stood with the Asian youth). Right from when the first 50 arrived they were taunting swearing and chanting racist comments at us. After 30mins or so the other 700 turned up and were very effectively penned into the grass area that had been designated. There then seemed to be a steadily increasing amount of anger in this area which was let out when the smoke bombs/bottles/stones were thrown. The police then acted very quikely, they sent in riot police to push back the EDL and the lines of normal police in front of us moved us all back.

From my POV (and my large lens on the camera) I would say that 90% of the crowd of the EDL was very angry, it wasn't a peaceful protest at at all and if it wasn't for the police numbers it would have been a repeat of 2001.

For the makeup of the other side i would say it is as follows, 30% angry Asian youth, 50% Calm Asian (30+) and the rest were white English either leftist groups or middle class that cared enough to show their faces. 
Now I can pretty much see why the Asian youth was angry. Can you imagine if you were to have a group of people show up call you all the names under the sun (including paedophiles which I have no idea were it's come from) in a protest of you being there? I wouldn't be too happy about it to be honest.

There was no break in the lines from the police and when the stuff was thrown the police lines were reinforced.

I'm all for democratic protests but I believe that it should be democratic and not fascist. Their ideas are unfounded, brought on by fear, lack of education, anger and down right racism. Any right thinking individual knows that you cannot base ideas on race, religion, sex etc. 

Please don't read this as me saying extremism is ok, but you have to understand that this is a minority within the Muslim community. There are extremist christains and although they have not committed such atrocities as 9/11 I still don't brand all the Christians as idiots.

leaving the above out of it they were given the right to protest but in a manor which the police could could control, if they were left to march around town I would not have liked seeing the aftermath and would have avoided Bradford for the day. After seeing what happened in 2001 I think the police/government did the right thing.  

As for the aggressors well from my POV it was the EDL. The Asian youth were chanting back but they never moved to violence, even when the EDL threw things at them they very very easily moved out of range (with normally dressed police men and women) whereas the EDL it took Riot police.

I think you have to draw a line (as was done) when it is going to cause riots.

I've just got off the phone with a mate who stayed longer than I did (had a meal to get to). Anyway when it was time for them to go they jumped the fence and started further antagonising both the police and those demonstrating against them. Now if I wanted to get my message across on a point I'm not so sure throwing rocks and such at the police is such a good idea. It doesn't really say much about your ability to rationalise your argument and it doesn't really say much about your peaceful marches. Imagine if they were able to march through the town, I'm pretty sure now that the 2001 riots would have been re-created and as someone who has lived in Bradford since I moved out from my parents I really don't want to happen.

The really interesting point is I'm pretty sure I was visible from where they were standing along with alot of other white faces, would I have been a target for their anger? I'm not a Muslim (which is apparently what they are standing against) and yet they threw stiff at us, although maybe I would be collateral damage, or fraternising with the enemy!

Also as someone who works in online marketing I wouldn't necessarily put it all down to organised spin. I would think that some of those comments are supporters of the EDL and some just those who are just swept up in the movement. 

One thing to note. The UAF are not at all extreme. I used to be a fairly active socialist (grew up and realised this wasn't a workable solution and was even considering voting in conservatives last time round, if only the young me could see me now!) Now the old group I was in was about yesterday and they wanted a more direct approach to the EDL (not my view). But in comparison the UAF simply held a peace protest up he road, No violence, not even any contact with the EDL. It was just a gathering of people from all of Bradford with speakers and music etc. Hardly the picture given by this comment: ""I also stood for local elections as independant and when in town drumming support up for myself saw the UAF were out against the BNP. There were more frightened pensioners of the LOUD mouth, aggresive UAF than the BNP, this totally changed my view and rather than believe the daily mail clap trap who jump on the bandwagon researched""

But point one is not. The Stig is a character. Just as you can write a book and talk about Sherlock Homes or Harry Potter. As long as you do not damage the revenue of the original. The work must be significantly original but it can be about the same characters.

And a biography is a factual work. If you go to the studio and spend time working with the stig you are allowed to write about your experience. Unless you have signed a contract stating you will not.

UK libel laws are a little messed up. But truth is still considered defence.

If I write a biography saying the stig fucks minis on sunday mornings the BBC would have grounds to sue me under libel, for the damage to its revenue that the story would cause. 

But if I have a Mechanics report with the Stigs DNA in the exhaust pipe its gonna be hard for them to win in court.

The stig is a character as such cannot be IP. he can be a trademark (and the simplicity of his character makes him perfect for this) and his stories or events can be IP but the character itself cannot.

&gt;As long as the ratings benefit of Doctor Who is greater than the difference in viewership, it's a win to produce more Doctor Who over more Merlin.

But it's not a win, the BBC has to try and cater for everyone, that is to say, that some programmes might not be contrastable. They may be based on their own merits/ratings/budget.

true,Orbixx,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"I used to have some form of social anxiety, but this was due to a horrible life through secondary school; I went to the worst school in my city, and my city isn't that great. Coventry.

I'm pretty sure I also suffer with some form of clinical depression, but it could also just be that I am the way I am, it's difficult to know the difference.

I deal with it, though. I hit breaking point with social anxiety about 4 years ago when I was 16 and simply stopped caring about people and started to be myself, but in a much more extrovert manner. People still annoy me as much as they used to, but I tolerate it far better. That and I'm able to socialise with lots of people I wouldn't have normally socialised with, even if I don't really like them that much, or I don't find them interesting.

All these conditions seem to have a correlation with people who are into IT in some manner, whether or not they get into IT because of these conditions, or whether being into IT causes these conditions is really unknown to me, though.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"What subjects did you take at A Level, and when you say you haven't done well, did you still get a grade that isn't a U?

If you get a doctors diagnosis and a letter from your doctor, go to your local University and speak to the course leader for the course you want to do. They won't be able to admit you, but you'll have an idea of what will be expected of you if you choose to go.

After that, go to see the admissions tutor for the course. There's a good chance you wouldn't be able to start this close to the start of term, but you can ask still. Talk to them about your current A Level grades and explain why you want to do the course and your situation.

Chances are you will have to enter to start next year if they let you in, but you can apply for a student loan online. You don't have to apply through UCAS, most universities operate an applications system that works outside that, so if you really are set on going to University, you need to talk to the University you wanted to go to on a face-to-face basis. Arrange any appointments you need and jump through the relevent hoops.

If you feel University on a campus isn't for you, look at the Open University. I have been told you can get student loans for them too, but I have no way of verifying that. They offer plenty of courses that could be of value to you, although if you want to meet people to make friends like at University, you'll be a bit stuck.

I can honestly say the best place to start is by talking to everyone. Ring up Universities and make appointments to see people and do what you can. The only real obstacle that can stop you from being able to do it is yourself, and sometimes it can be rewarding to just go against that sinking feeling of hopelessness just to prove you can do it.

I've been on and off anti-depressants for the past few years and I have social problems - I don't like to talk to people I don't know or don't feel like getting to know, and the education system had a tendancy to try force me to talk and integrate, and I used to take days off just to skip lessons I hated. I tend to have to go against my gut feeling to prove that I can do the things I want, and it's pretty hard.

true,mistyriver,null,null,"&gt; You say you work in children's theatre, that sounds like fun as I'm sure watching them interact and have fun must be rewarding, much like parenting can be if you let it : )

It's not really bona-fide work. It's just volunteering. I am on the board of my local theater company... and we do at least one big kids' production each year. 

I was enrolled in the education department at the local university last year, and had the opportunity to study the education systems in different nations. I also often go scraping up Youtube videos and whatever other documentation I can find about kids in real situations in various anglophone countries - at home and at school. 

I have seen that there are many fundamental differences between various nations in how people live and how they think. One of these areas is how kids are raised and how they are schooled. I think that kids grow up to be smarter adults in Britain than they would if they were raised in the USA. However, I wouldn't give credit to the essentialist school pedagogy that is so common in Britain - but rather to the way kids are perceived by adults. 

Kids in the USA are not respected. They're seen as little flurries of nonsense; they are thought not to have the ability to reason, because their minds haven't developed yet. And I think that this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy over here. If kids are raised for twenty years with everyone around them believing that they cannot reason things through - they won't ever learn how to do that. In the USA, children are kept in little bubbles their whole childhood - so to speak.

Kids in Britain seem to be allowed to test their wit against real situations more often - and they're allowed to suffer the consequences of their own decisions to a certain extent. I think that we over here across the pond would do well to do this more often with our kids. You Brits seem to understand that children do think and reason - even if they're being silly, and even if their perspectives on the world aren't mature yet.

&gt; I  don't think what you were watching on TV is something to go by, for a start it takes a certain type of attention seeking parent to push their child into being on TV in the first place and that's probably something to do with the culture of TV at the moment and all those programs where everyday people try to be famous, reality TV programs and 'talent' seeking contests that sort of stuff.

I know what you're saying... but I can't spend an extended period of time in Britain. The best source of information I have to research and learn about your country is video. I think I can control somewhat for the fact that a particular kind of kid gets on television.  I have also studied child actors in Disney films in the USA - and I can compare that with what I see in the personality of ordinary kids in my community with whom I work.

&gt; they basically want attention and to be in control 

They want the right to self-determination. They are their own people - and of course they will very wilfull in pursuing those experiences that they want to have. I wouldn't agree that kids want to walk all over their parents and caregivers. No kid flourishes when that happens.

&gt; That stiff upper lip thing you mention, I think children should be made to do things they don't want to do, it's a valuable lesson in life 

It's fundamental to being a parent or caregiver that you step in, be in control, and do what's in the best interests of the child - regardless of the child's wishes. Kids who are particularly troubled might throw a tantrum when they are not allowed to run out and put themselves in danger when they had a goal in mind. Of course, an adult needs to maintain a firm stance, and is in his right to feel quite smug about protecting the child. 

However, there's a difference between that, and doing what I've seen in some of these BBC reality shows where kids are put into situations that are inherently unfair - or where because of their lack of preparation for the event, the children will get hurt and scratched up. An adult needs to provide a nurturing environment - and needs to socially engineer situations with groups of kids so that each kid gets a valuable and enjoyable experience.

&gt;  there are a few programs, one about a nanny I've heard mentioned but when I have seen them it seems to me that the child's problems stem from the parent, lack of clear boundaries not responding to inappropriate behaviour 

I've watched an episode or two of that ""Super Nanny"" program... and my impression is that again, the thing that causes kids in those families to act out so much is something that the cameras will never catch, and that parents won't talk about - and that's corporal punishment. It can appear that the parents are being too laissez faire with the children - but from my experience studying kids and families, I can say that invariably kids who have become wild and unmanageable have been hit quite a bit.

This has been a delightful conversation Toffeeapple! Thanks for taking the time to chat with me. 

I'm fascinated to see that other Brits here at Reddit came to believe that I was trolling. I wasn't. I'm a dilettante, and I study people and sociological systems on my own. And this is exactly how I do it. I gather all the information I can about a topic and start musing. I have learned something today about the British style of intellectualism - from seeing how averse some of your countryfolk are, to this kind of conversation.

It sounds as if you're a very conscientious and loving dad to your children. I wish you and your kids all the best. Kids do need their fathers - that's for sure. Good male role models are extremely important - especially for boys.

* Check out thestudentroom.co.uk, it's all in the name really, a website for students mostly by students, but there's plenty of university-level and older demographics pottering around in there. There's forums and info for different courses from GCSEs, A Levels, to NVQs to IB, uni and choices, undergraduate courses, and even a section on alternative ways to go to uni, even gap year. You can get help on pretty much everything, from uni choices to UCAS to where to go on your gap year. BONUS: They also sometimes list scholarships, openings on apprenticeships and jobs.

* Have a look at notgoingtouni.co.uk, they list out vacancies for apprenticeships and also have a section for foundation courses, etc. 

* Open University? It's distance learning, so it might help your social anxiety. Check out the website.

* If you want to retake your A Levels, you can save money by going back to your old school/sixth form (preferably with a doctors diagnosis, might help your case) and work out a way for you to be able to get back in class. It will be free (I can't citate, but I had a friend that's a similar case like you before and apparently you are entitled to free education up to A Levels or equivalent until you're 23, but check first) but the downside is that it *might* make you feel even more socially awkward as you're older. But guess what, its not about them, its about you, and you're still within the age range that is typical to do A Levels, so walk in that class like a boss.

* Stop doing drugs excessively. I'm saying this on assumption, you may as well not be but with a history of depression and you're also verging on being on the margin, so stop doing it. I don't care if it's just weed, or the whole cocktail, end it now. 

* Get your shit together. Living in the UK has given you amazing educational opportunities at a low financial cost, and even more, the ability to do it again and again.

There simply isn't that much to learn on art degrees. Deal with this fact.

Secondly STEM subjects are useful to the economy. Art subjects are not. This is another fact people should learn to deal with. If anything we should be subsidising the useful degrees. Not penalising them for the fact.

If we want to start going down this path then I propose we get rid of all state funding for degrees and fund them directly. This way STEM students can pay £15k a year and art students £12.5k. Then we reduce taxation to compensate. I'm sure the art students will manage a £37.5k debt just as well as the STEM students will manage £45k. If you want to play capitalist then lets do it properly.

It takes us 7 days to order &amp; recieve through our supplier so there maybe a short wait of around 10 days after purchasing until you recieve it. Would this be ok?
Cheers! Andy

First of all, you have to play the waiting game. Every-so-often they have  a sale online with tickets going as cheap as 1p, so you have to keep your eyes pealed. Next, pay the booking fee (which is often waved for sale tickets), make some sandwiches before you head off so you don't have to buy anything onboard, weigh your bag before you set off and wear extra layers of clothes. Finally, take a shit before you board the plane.

There was an entire episode of Panorama about Ryanair on BBC a few months ago.

Really though, the wider issue here is the fees themselves. Ultimately ""value for money"" is incredibly difficult to measure, especially when the only alternative to higher education is sitting on the dole.

But it's insanity to suggest that the government should do anything more to disincentivise science. Alongside cutting the science budget, we really will just end up as an insignificant backwater.

Now, in a way to cut corners and save money/stay on budget, universities are doing their own austerity packages (maybe that's a little too severe a phrase) and as a result some degrees, especially ones where it does not need specialised equipment, vocational training or lab space is whittled down to make up for the costs taken up by other degrees. Humanities degrees are losing out in the competition for a cut of university budgets, and that's thanks to the current government and the last government's mistakes.

I'd decided my 2 children and I needed only one checked bag for the long weekend (£8 per piece of checked luggage, both ways), we'd suck up the checking in charge (£4 each, both ways - that's fair, we're all checking in, right?), but at the payment page, despite having a Maestro card, they wanted an extra £4 per person per direction just for the booking charge.

The ""purchase price"" of the tickets being originally £0.01 for one direction and £9.99 for the other, I decided that ending up paying well over £100 to be left out in the middle of the German country side at 1am was just plain daft.

Edit: Another comment I find quite interesting:

&gt;Well, if all of these people have nothing better to do than attempt to corrupt the youth of today into a continuation of the ASBO teens that plague society believing they ""don't have to conform to rules and regulations"", then what a giant waste of time. Go out, get a job, do something constructive with your time and help your country.

Completely proves the point of some people not understanding 4chan in particular and the internet generally. I think if you asked the average ""ASBO teen"" if they visited 4chan, and then explained that it was an internet message board, you'd probably get a response along the lines of ""that's for geeks/nerds/whatever"". I would suggest that the kind of people that visit 4chan and, indeed, Reddit, do have jobs and are not the people ""Sophie"" presumably sees hanging around her street corner.

Because the show bounces back and forth through time, it's really unclear how the development of daleks occurred chronologically. In the early seasons they could only move on metal surfaces and could not climb stairs. Now they can fly and travel through time! Of course their own use of time travel now makes things even more complicated. Why does the Doctor constantly keep running into contemporary dalek models, why hasn't he met an old model recently? Or, perhaps a better question, why hadn't an old Doctor met a newer dalek?

Then there's R2D2, a robot that could fly during the time of Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader. But later when Luke was learning the Force and working against the Empire, R2 acted as if it had no idea how to fly and never did. What's going on there? Is R2D2 capable of time travel as well? Perhaps it developed its own temporal shift mechanism like the daleks, or it could have stolen a TARDIS from the Time Lords like the Doctor did, or maybe it stole a vortex manipulator off the wrist of a handsome time agent?

[The Doctor and Amy arrive on a human colony ship returning to Earth after it was rendered uninhabitable by solar flares. Without provocation, they are attacked by the ship’s maintenance robots and become separated in the struggle.](/spoiler)

[The Doctor is eventually led to the ship’s Head Quarters, where he discovers a Cyber Leader has connected himself to the ships AI and is blackmailing it into doing his bidding, or else he’ll kill the crew.](/spoiler)

[Meanwhile the Cybermen that were hiding in the ship ambush Amy and chase her out into space. Guide the Doctor and Amy as they face their biggest adventure yet!](/spoiler)

[Evacuation Earth Nintendo DS -- Released October 29th -- MSRP £34.99](/spoiler)

[When the Doctor and Amy arrive at the Lake District to watch the humans leave the planet, the TARDIS suddenly gets lifted from them and bolted onto the evacuation ship. They have to make their way onto the ship before it leaves.](/spoiler)

[As the ship launches, it has technical problems and they realise the Silurians have built a ship underneath. The Doctor finds a solution to make the ship work.](/spoiler)

[Suddenly, the Dalek ship smashes into the human one and splits the Silurian half off. It’s the Dalek ship that chased the Time Axis into the sun - they weren’t destroyed, they actually made a random jump several hundred years into the past.](/spoiler)

[The Daleks are pleased that they can exact revenge on the Doctor but first they make him fix their ship. The Doctor goes along with their plan but tricks them into bolting the TARDIS onto their ship, which he promptly jumps into and uses to fling them into the nearest black hole.](/spoiler)
