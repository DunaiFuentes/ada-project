true,soundacious,null,null,"I've actually held a very similar theory for a long time. Well done!  :)

On a practical level, I doubt this idea was part of the process when the show was young, but by the time producer John Nathan Turner came around (Doc 4's last season and Docs 5-7) I suspect that something very like it was used to make those casting decisions. 

TV Movie 8 was sort of his own beast, an attractive, young mix of attributes from various Doctors. Then, when the new series started up, you had Russell Davies, who started his run with a shell-shocked Doctor in personal crisis after losing the rest of his race in a brutal Time War, and very conflicted about his own role in the proceedings. When we first see him, he's about to blow up a building! What an un-Doctor-ish thing to do!

But then he meets up with Rose, and is reminded of the simple pleasures of travelling the cosmos with a hot human (or humanoid) companion, and how they tend to surprise and delight him. Rose nearly sacrifices herself for the Doctor at the end of NuSeries 1, so it's no surprise that the newly regenerated Doc 10 is all wrapped up in Rose and all things human.

When Rose leaves at the end of NuSeries 2, Doc 10 is at a loss. He goes from lovesick giddiness to an almost suicidal outlook (remember that he begs the Daleks to kill him in Manhattan).  At the end of NuSeries 4 (before the specials) Doc 10 has a tearful and satisfying reunion with all his own chums, but abruptly turns his back on all of them and goes off to travel by himself again for who knows how long. 

In the midst of this period of both denial and self-recrimination, he receives portents of his own impending doom. Of course, he reacts with yet more denial, and when the moment of his fatal dose of radiation finally comes, he holds back on the regeneration process for as long as he possibly can, just to make some level of amends with his past.

All that bottled up pain and radiation poisoning makes for an explosive transformation and a primal scream that brings us to a much more self-satisfied and alien Doctor, still nurturing one hell of a dark side (aka The Dream Lord).

However, If I do a masters I might be forced to pay higher fees which is a disincentive to sign up, even though it should better my job prospects.

The second link is an anecdote hence irrelevant.

The third link attributes all reductions in accidents over the time period to speed cameras. Over the same period we have seen a drastic increase in the quality of vehicles in terms of safety. Over that time period ABS has gone from a luxury to standard. Massive numbers of cars have traction control and ESP today. The compounds used in brakes are dramatically improved today as in 2000, brakes simply work better. The introduction of better science around airbags, crumple zones, side impact bars and other safety features has also change motoring beyond recognition. We also have the fact that the standard of the actual driving test has been improved dramatically during that period so that younger drivers are hitting the roads at a higher standard that previously. Also the vast increase in insurance costs means that the number of 17 year olds on the road have actually decreased.

[They're doing it through the back-door](http://liberalconspiracy.org/2010/11/30/worried-about-nhs-being-privatised-you-should-be/).


As I've said elsewhere, these cuts are inevitable. For global capitalism means the multinational corporations can play the nations off against eachother to get lower taxes and lower wages, and the nations have no choice but to play along as no nations are self-sufficient anymore, so the nations cut their taxes and repeal labour and environmental protections in an attempt to attract international business, but this loss in tax revenue means cuts in services _must_ be made or else the national debt will increase.

And so this leads to a loss in national sovereignty either through direct intervention by the IMF, etc. or indirectly as the neoliberal parties are elected as unemployment and the national debt rises and they claim these are examples of the failure of government intervention.

This race to the bottom between nations will lead to all nations having to cut their services in an attempt to make their labour cheaper than elsewhere (and automation), and we can already see this with the cuts being made in so many nations, here, France, Sweden, Ireland, etc. - and the majority of people welcome it, for they say it is necessary to lower the national debt, and soon that repealing the minimum wage etc. will be necessary to combat unemployment.

Who do we protest to when the decisions are forced from afar in this manner?

The only solution is to unite the protests across all nations, and radically reform the economic system to abolish the private monopoly system that has created such inequality, to make it such that increased automation leads to the relief of the work burden on all rather than increased concentration of wealth and unemployment, and provide free education for all so people are liberated from menial work and can lead meaningful lives, rather than being degraded to cheaper machines in the struggle for employment.

If you're willing to focus your life into research (and most research positions I know of, it is a major life decision - get into it, and if you leave, you've left - no coming back), then I'd say investing in a degree is worth it.

Computing, I wouldn't be so hasty to dismiss it if you're interested. People will disagree, but web design is easy to get into - you already have the tools available on your computer. There's a definite period of of learning, and I think it's dishonest to try to gain money during that period, but if you feel you have an interest and an aptitude in it, you'll be able to move onto freelance. Won't take long to build up a portfolio, and then you're in - degree be damned. During that time you'll also find yourself coming across other technologies - web development/programming, sort-of system administration - you might really enjoy one of those. Not many pre-requisites - being able to search for information and tutorials, and being able to type - you're posting here just fine, so I'd say you can already do these!

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"To be honest - I don't know. There may be less students, I can certainly say it's believable that will be the case in future. Without a HUGE overhaul in the education system though, that will become a problem.

I think the value of a degree is relative to whether or not you want to do it - I can say some people would probably be upset paying for a student to attend a degree with no real job prospects after. I would suspect your desire to have what you consider 'real subjects' are those which have direct application to an employment role, and you can't really fault that. Those are essentially always going to be present.

I see subjects such as History to be of value culturally, in teaching or other such roles, but I suspect every department could defend itself quite adequately.

Without an overhaul of the education system, the potential outcome is - less students, less graduates, no schemes to help develop skills outside University and ultimately a significant detrimental knock to the economy in the long-term.

I also would like to know how the government plans to fund the increased fee loans. If this is still taxpayers money, then they are being fiscally irresponsible promoting the '30 years and it disappears' line as it will initially cost a lot more to provide loans with no guarantee it will ever return.

On this count, a graduate tax would result in a return by every graduate towards the cost of the degree - even if it wasn't enough to pay for the cost of the tutoring, I suspect it will be more than some of the graduates will return under the new proposals.",0,1291937649,null,0,false,0,c18hecc,t3_ej1a6,t1_c18hecc,t1_c18hbw0,null,1426621656,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Back to the violence thing - there wasn't much violence, more just aggression and destruction which is different.

I'm kind of crossed between the mature option, and my actual experience of today -- Parliament Square was like something out of Fallout - post apocalyptic with people gathered around fires to keep warm.

That was so awful, I was being detained for doing nothing wrong.

There was a distinct feeling that the idea behind kettling is essentially to make people so miserable that they don't want to come and protest again.

If the police at the peaceful side of the demo are really nice and chatty and just basically normal people, then you get a bunch of demonstrators leaving saying ""yeah, the police were great"" and then they get stopped by news crews and are asked ""so what were the actions of the police today?"" and they say ""yeah, they were great, really nice"" and the news crews say ""so how do you feel about the protestors who were attacking the police with stones and metal poles?"" and because their last memory is of a policeman saying ""make sure you have a safe journey home, mate"" they say ""yeah, that's awful"". 

I think you are entirely right about militarising the protestors, though. The biggest problem with protests like this is that there are so many diverse groups that an effective command and control structure is stupidly politicised. Effectively, you need a group of people both within and without the demonstration - on the streets inside the demo, outside the demo, on surrounding streets, and watching live helicopter news feeds, who can direct ""group commanders"" inside the demo, each of whom is in touch with maybe 20 or 30 people, who have 6 - 12 friends with them.

The Open University is an effective and cheap option (especially if your income is low - they have some great benefits, could even be free) and it's a little known fact (that universities will not share with you) the *last* place you study is pretty much the kicker in every case (consider a student who did a BA at Leeds then a MA at some cheap dump, vs a student who did an OU BA but then had a MA from Durham!).

You could do an Open University degree in a social science of some sort, kick ass, then go and do an MA in Anthropology in a more prestigious institution. Why? You end up with a *better* qualification for less money! The MA only takes a year, frequently has bursaries, and MA Anthropology courses do not typically require an undergraduate degree in the same subject..

There are a lot of legitimate ""hacks"" around the standard system. It's key to remember education is an industry and the traditional route is pushed so hard because it makes money. With ingenuity, though, you can get some serious qualifications in your field without breaking the bank.

Just while I have your ear, if you take a route like this, ensure that you're blogging or otherwise putting together a solid public record of your work, insights, and so forth along the way. It will prove invaluable to get into a good MA or PhD program and potential employers will also be impressed (and may even find you through this way if you end up running a really good anthropology related blog). It's also a good idea to start doing your own anthropology related research, going to conferences, and (carefully) communicating with anthropology professors in the last year of your undergraduate - these can be the cherry on top when applying for the MA.

He was the first Doctor in a long time who wasn't part of the costume brigade, so no really outlandish dresses, nothing quirky, just a very nondescript traveler. At first I hated that. The Doctor should be quirky! Long scarves! Overcoats! Something memorable! 

The second time through, I started to realize that the Ninth Doctor was more of a low-key traveler. He wasn't exactly the madcap world-saver that other Doctors had been, and the more I watched, the more it grew on me. Heck, I even liked his Slitheen episodes, although I think the Slitheen are a pretty juvenile character concept (Stupid gross-out humor...).

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"Implementation is the weakest point. I don't know of anywhere that has such a system in use. When it is brought up, it is dismissed as being more expensive for the lowest earners than the current proposals will end up being, but I would personally find it to be much more fiscally responsible.

I imagine it would be an extra amount on top of income tax, most likely if you earned over a certain amount and probably only for a certain length of time - let's say 2% off of everything you earn over £21,000 for the purpose of this comparison for 30 years. It would probably cost more than these proposals but you would generally be contributing towards the system. It's just vastly awkward to implement - especially if you consider the issues we've already seen with PAYE income tax.

An alternative would be a hybrid system - perhaps have a one-off tuition fee loan of £1000 - £2000 per year with a graduate tax applied for a shorter period of time after graduation - the end result is you would be guaranteed to be returning money into the system, but it returns to the possibility of leaving a void that is never repaid.

You could perhaps have every graduate paying 2% extra income tax for 30 years regardless of income without a minimum earnings limit. I've not done much working out, but the point would be that it would affect all earners and people of all backgrounds and provide a return to help fund the system.

High unemployment was the bane of the Thatcher government.  ""Maggie's Millions"" was the cry of the day.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Established classic series canon: The regeneration cycle is not a natural ability of Galifreyans, it is bestowed upon a timelord when he/she graduates from the academy. All Galifreyans are *not* timelords. ALL timelords have the regen cycle bestowed upon them. MOST timelords *do not* have a personal TARDIS they can bond with and travel about the universe as they please. Therefore (as I see it), TARDISes have exactly ZERO things to do with the regeneration cycle except that they provide a good environment for a timelord to do so in away from Galifrey and other timelords. Now, yes, the **hard limit** in the classic series was 12 regens, 13 bodies. ""After the 12th renegeration it is *impossible* for a timelord to continue"" -The Castellan in *The Deadly Assassin* However, the Castellan in *The Five Doctors* states that the Master's reward for helping the Doctors will be ""Regeneration. A complete new life cycle"", which indicates that it isn't *impossible* at that point. So now we leave established canon and come to the time war, which has not been seen onscreen and the only canonized events in it are what is mentioned onscreen in the new series. SO, ""the timelords went to war and they changed."" So now maybe they don't limit the renegerations of their operatives (The Doctor was a (sometimes unwilling) operative for the Celestial Intervention Agency in the classic series and I assume continued as one to some degree into the fuzzy world of the 8th Doctor and the time war). I mean think about it, quite inconvenient to have a complex and difficult mission fail because your op uses his last body but would have survived and been able to complete it had he had another regeneration... so maybe they extended it, maybe to an almost infinite degree. Someone mentioned the Minyans from the story *Underworld* elsewhere in this thread and *they* could regenerate (with the help of machinery) ""1000 times 1000 times, going on and on..."" for 100,000 years! They weren't time travellers but they were given the technology by the timelords so they literally lived every second of that 100k years. Anyhow, the timelords were way better than the Minyans at technology and regeneration so maybe they found a way to give infinite regen ability to their operatives or all timelords even without the need to lug around machinery and maybe the Doctor HAS such machinery aboard the TARDIS because he is the only one left and someone has to keep the web of time intact and maybe the show will get cancelled before it's actually an issue :P But in any case the TARDIS is an amazing machine and does many things for and sometimes against the Doctor but it has fuck all to do with his regen cycle...

Calling something a fallacy and it being so are two rather different things. 

You claim that competitive tax rates attract investment as if this argues against my point. However, your use of the term 'competitive' in fact proves it. A ‘competitive’ tax rate is by definition relational. It is only competitive if it is lower than other states. The same incentive applies to others thus: When Country A follows your rationale and reduces corporation tax in order to attract investmen it compels oh-so rational Country B to do the same and reduce its corporation tax. The result? A race to the bottom. A wet dream for wealthy investors; a rank nightmare for the public at large. 

This is quite clear...

The tuition fee debate is, of course, a separate one from the relative merits of state business taxes. However, I personally believe education is a public good which should be supported out of public taxation.  If we had a truly progressive income tax system then your concern about the fortunate parts of society not paying their fair share would presumably be resolved. Moreover, my fear is that by saddling all and any child interested in taking up further education (excepting those from sufficiently privileged backgrounds to have that debt paid off immedietly) with at least £27,000 worth of debt we massively retard the options for what they do with their new found knowledge. Not to mention it will disincentives kids from going to university at a time when a skilled individuals are of paramount importance to the future knowledge economy.

&gt; The UK is dominated by the public sector economy and is a basket case for it. What services? Crap schools and hospitals?

Hyperbolic nonsense which I won’t bother with. Could it be better? Yes. Is it ‘crap’? No. That those hospitals have far better health outcomes for less cost than the private alternative as employed in the US, which you would presumably espouse, says it all really.

&gt; The private sector is riskier, lower paid,

Lower paid?

**Lower Paid?**

**LOWER PAID?**

I am a commercial director for a small private business. I have zero vested interest in defending the wages of public sector worker beyond that of any sane, fair minded citizen. However to erroneously claim that equivalent public sector remuneration is higher than the private sector is really quite remarkable.

If you want to look at thugs then look to to the police.

I am a girl of 5 foot 2, I was pushed several times in the face, dragged on the floor and laughed at by police when I told them I had asthma. This is why people get angry, because people were being trapped and wanted to get out.
All afternoon we were told people were able to leave from various places but this was just not true.

I asked a policeman were I could go to the toilet, he pointed at the floor by his feet.
Another shouted 'move bitch or i'll squash you with my horse'.

Eventually, when the protests had died down and people were desperate to go home, a group of around 1000 protesters were finally escorted to westminster bridge to exit, however this was a trick. What then happened was we were held on the bridge for hours in the freezing cold. The crowd remained calm, but after hours of freezing people began to chant 'let us out' and then the crowd pushed forwards. Being small I was carried by the crowd and ended up by the police line. I was tired and cold and hadn't eaten for 12 hours of had any water.
I screamed at the police not to hurt me because i was being pushed but they still went for my face almost pulling me to the floor. A man to my right put his arms over my face screaming ' Leave her alone, she's a girl, she's not harming you' but the police began to hit him several times on the head.

When we were finally let off the bridge it was one at a time through huge crowds of jeering officers. We were told we were being photographed incase we had damaged royal car. But how this could have happened whilst we were kettled in parliament i don't know.

Seems inconclusive at best to me. I think I’ll pass.


Plus, presumably once corporation tax is zero the next area requiring a 'competitive' tax regime will be capital gains. The good news is that after this reckless race to the bottom we won’t have a tax base other than citizens; leaving us with the unenviable choice between punitive income taxes and a paucity of state provision. I am sure we’ll all be delirious about our quality of life when healthcare, emergency services, public transport, road contruction and maintanence, unemployment benefit and all the rest have safely become either privatised monopolies or disappear dependant on profitability.


&gt; You tuition argument is erroneous given your support for progressive taxation. Even funded another way, would it not be the high earners paying for it? Besides the debts would be at least 18k, not 27k.


I don’t even... Yes I think people with more money should pay more proportionately in tax. No, I don’t agree with the rise in tuition fees which indebts individual students. These two positions are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, while you are welcome to disagree with my position, it is not inherently erroneous.


&gt; Regarding pay: http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_labour/ashe-2010/2010-gor-pps.pdf
Accounting for pensions, holidays, sick days, perquisite consumption, and employment risk the total benefits and rewards of the private sector are significantly lower than public sector workers.


Firstly, the source you provided is a contents page PDF without any figures at all. However, even if I accept that the document is as you say, it still wouldn’t support you original claim:


&gt; The private sector is riskier, lower **paid**


Paid: To receive money to in return for goods or services rendered 


Other benefits usually available to the public sector may mitigate the lower pay they receive but it is inaccurate to claim this means they are higher paid. Take for example intangible benefits like ‘employment risk’ which you cite as evidence that the public sector is in fact higher paid. Why not go the whole hog and factor in the altruistic gratification a nurse feels in helping her fellow man, ascribe an arbitrary financial value, and add that to her ‘pay’.


Yes there are some non financial benefit, ceteris paribus, to being employed in the public sector rather than the private. But to pretend that is the same as pay is disingenuous.

In the UK we have the NHS, and until fairly recently a grant system paid for University education too.

As a society we pay taxes to the government in return for the protection/promotion of our basic needs and rights. It is not such a strange thing to demand that our rights and needs be taken care of first when government is spending the money we have earned ourselves!

The standard reply from lib dems when asked about their free educations is 'we cant afford it now, much more people go to university now!' This is nonsense. The more people who go to university, the more powerful and educated our workforce becomes, therefore more income is created, therefore more taxes are collected. A well educated workforce pays for itself.

If someone gets a good job/salary because of their degree they will end up paying for their education in the long run anyway, they just won't be paying interest on the loan, or have the debt hanging over their heads their entire career.

Lots of pushing away with riot shields as they extracted metal fences that were being thrown at them. Saw sparse use of batons, tbh. 

Obviously I'm limited to what I saw on the news, however if there really were savage beatings they would be on the news too. 

They would make a great story. 

I just didn't really see them. The worst thing was probably charging the horses at the protesters to split them up, however then someone threw a piece of wood and it hit a horse in the head.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8750218

People who are either ''for'' or ''against'' what is happening are kind of missing the point - which is - it's happening. And I have been saying for ages on these boards that this sort of thing will happen - more and more frequently. It doesn't surprise me that on Newsnight last night - it appeared that from the footage many of those doing the actual rioting were young men. If you take away peoples hopes and chances of a job etc then you have to be prepared either to pay them enough dole or whatever else to keep them quiet, or you will face massive unrest.

Even Thatcher knew that! Cut JSA and ESA to the bone, cut EMA altogether, let the banks keep not lending to SME's, so more jobs go - and you have the perfect recipe for unrest and eventually social breakdown.

On france 24 yesterday there was a debate about Portugals debt crisis - people are also rioting in Portugal - they are angry and more than that they are scared. The report said that the standard of living for many in Portugal has collapsed in a way not seen since the 1930's. I am sure a lot of this is about more than fees for those who were running around Oxford street etc smashing things up - it is about seeing banks getting more and more money whilst whole community's are targeted for the second time by neo-liberalism.

First they came and took working class jobs and decimated industry and now they are coming for the benefits that have kept those people able to eat at least - and then they wonder where the anger comes from. I am not saying here that I think this anger is constructive -in fact it is possibly not as there is no alternative ideology like socialism etc driving it - it is just pure anger. And that is dangerous.

And yesterday in the US the banks payed out bonuses early so their staff could buy Christmas presents whilst thousands protested outside them asking for jobs. People can see that what is happening is the biggest gulf opening up between 'them' and 'us' since feudal times. Unlike the thirty's no bankers have thrown themselves out of windows in despair this time around - quite the opposite - the rich have got even richer.

And as one of the academics said on France 24 last night - ''this is now very serious and in Europe and elsewhere there is a risk people will turn to extremism''. Which is again something I have been saying for ages on these boards to those ultra-pragmatic, right wingers, who think like accountants with their 'there is no money left we have to cut' mentality. The problem with neo-liberalism is it is based on the cold, hard logic of Freidman - who never once understood that economics is not purely mathemtatical - it cannot be because it deals with human beings. We are now seeing those human beings react under the strain of this shock doctrine. As things get even harder for most people then we may see much more violence than this and we may see real bloodshed. The bankers and their puppets are playing a very dangerous game.

For all we know, the officer could've just been serious, but joking when he spoke of the 'consequences' of attacking David Cameron. The police officer may not have been clear about the joke, or the kid may not have perceived it well.

Or not. But my point is, don't make a judgement until you have the facts, and in a case like this, the facts are subjective as there is no evidence. You could all be getting 'outraged' over nothing.

So far the NUS has yet to fulfil this role, I don't think Aaron Porter has been on the ground yet, instead preferring to offer only tacit political support and dithering. If the NUS was to come up with a reasonable proposal that at the very least matched funding and most importantly was simple as an alternative, then this is something to rally around. (I'd suggest just taking the re-payment program of 9% of earnings over £21K, adjusted for inflation annually, payable until retirement, calling it a graduate tax and dropping the entire idea of debt as the best plan). 

If they have an alternative that is better than ""make it free"", and they stage mass peaceful protests with an eye for a long hard fight then they will get further than short outbursts of violence, which do nothing more than kill public support.

true,Sir_D_Chicken-Caesar,null,null,"There seems to be two issues you have somewhat collated; should poor people pay for university, and should people who don't go to university pay for it.

Sure, the poor pay the same proportion of their tax for HE, but why shouldn't this be the case? They benefit too, they use the inventions and improvements, they experience the art, etc etc etc. Perhaps they don't benefit as much, they are definitely funding them less. Not to mention the potential HE has to help people out of poverty. They can attend university whilst only funding a small proportion.

Should those who don't attend pay? Again, they benefit from all the societal advances made by those who did. I'd like to think having a higher educated population helps the country in a lot of crucial ways, aiding democracy, culture, medical advances, creating jobs, etc.

The thing that bothers me about the graduate tax idea, is that it would act to discourage those who feel they have the ability to make money with or without university from attending. The idea of having an extra portion of your income taken away indefinitely because you did a course when you were 18-21 I find very disconcerting. Whilst it probably wouldn't be a rational position, I think it would have acted to discourage me. It would also encourage graduates to emigrate.

As it was seemed to (just) work IMO; students payed more than those who didn't attend through the fees, but not 100% of the cost as there are big societal benefits.

It means those who study hard degrees like Engineering, Physics, Mathematics, etc. are effectively subsidising those who go for only a 3-year piss-up doing I.T. etc.

Besides, how do the NUS intend to fund the universities in the interim period between the abolition of tuition fees and the returns on the Graduate Tax? (I regret there wasn't any opportunity to ask this question first-hand)

Why isn't free education attainable? We have the best technology we have ever had and the highest productive capacity we have ever had, why should we face a _loss_ of opportunities?

Perhaps if the government stopped wasting so much money in letting Vodafone, Phillip Green, etc. evade taxes, waging two endless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and letting thieves like Fred Goodwin and Asil Nadir escape punishment (I doubt it's a coincidence that the latter donated half a million pounds to the Tory party), then we could afford to fund our nation's education.

Or you can be neither violent nor inconvenient and simply be ignored, which is what happened in 1997 with the original tuition protests and again in 2003/2004 with top-up fees and the Iraq War.

The students are not the greedy violent self-interested people the media are making them out to be - in fact most current students are not affected by these changes. They are protesting because it is wrong that those who are but a few years younger than us should have to pay three times simply because of unfortunate timing and the irresponsibility of the political class and the financial sector - and I believe that the public (and especially parents) would support the students in this view.

I believe many sympathisers would have no problem bringing supplies to occupiers and sitting with them for a time for solidarity but you will not see the majority of people siding with a protest that smashes windows and urinates on memorials to those who fought for our freedom. Now it is not the Fascists which threaten our freedom but the financiers who are forcing our children to pay for their excesses.

Of course not, but your question is completely irrelevant. Although there is due to be legislation such that if you are part of a gang involved in carrying out a murder, even if it can not be proved that you were the one who struck the fatal blow, you can still be convicted by association.

If you remain at a violent protest/riot, you are participating in the riot. That's how riots work, they require people to be present. If you disagree with the riot - leave immediately, do not participate and it'll fizzle out.

Ultimately, many of the universities _are_ running nonsense courses to increase their profits (and this will likely only increase with the increasing privatisation). I would recommend nationalising the universities to prevent this, the profit motive has no benefit in education (and I believe very limited benefit elsewhere too).

I think education should be free, and I think in the modern economy it must be a right, for without it the people will only face unemployment and hardship.

I think the government should also fund adult education for the same reason, and this would remove the perceived unfairness in the funding.

But the problem with looking at this is you can't take some views in isolation from others. I really think we need to fundamentally reform the economic system to a socialist planned economy across a union of nations. The whole reason we are facing a huge national debt and decreasing services despite the best technology and highest productive capacity we have ever had is because the multinational corporations can play the nations off against each other to obtain the lowest taxes and wages, this is leading to the same race to the bottom in all nations as we see in Ireland, France, Sweden, etc. The fact that automation only increases unemployment rather than relieving the work burden on all acts as a catalyst to this, since we must make our labour cheaper than other nations _and_ automation, to retain international business and so employment (since we aren't self-sufficient anymore).",0,1292066808,null,0,false,0,c18ntj7,t3_ejr5o,t1_c18ntj7,t1_c18nt3q,null,1426624675,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

&gt;Why isn't free education attainable? ... 

&gt;Perhaps if the government stopped wasting so much money in letting Vodafone, Phillip Green, etc evading taxes, waging two endless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and letting thieves like Fred Goodwin and Asil Nadir escape punishment (I doubt it's a coincidence that the latter donate half a million pounds to the Tory party), then we could afford to fund our nation's education.

That was my point. The government would never stop doing all that so it would be better to compromise instead of demanding everything.

You know who else has been saying this recently? Nick Clegg.

There is __no__ use in compromising when the _compromise_ is no better (or even worse) than the government proposals.

&gt;There is no chance of the NHS being privatised.

I'm not sure if this is optimism or naivety. They won't just come out one day and say ""sorry chaps, we've sold it!"" - they'll do it with subtleness such that they have public support. I think they will do it with these NHS reforms, when the NHS is burdened with the changes of the reforms and all the bureaucracy that has been introduced over the years, they will allow private competition to the NHS in different areas of the country, and then when the NHS is outcompeted people will say ""well the private healthcare is more efficient!"" and ""why are we paying twice?"" and so the public will turn against the NHS. [This is already happening in the name of free trade and free competition!](http://liberalconspiracy.org/2010/11/30/worried-about-nhs-being-privatised-you-should-be/)

My point is they do it slowly and carefully. It's like the famous [Nuclear Deterrent scene in Yes, Minister](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_d_vMKswE). There will _never_ be any one moment where you can say ""we must stand up now"", because they _know_ there would be a revolution if there was.

They'll use the same method to remove the minimum wage, already we can see this with the welfare reforms. They reform the welfare claiming it is necessary to cut the national debt and to stop scroungers, etc. - this means that those who are left unemployed will be truly desperate in the future, and so as the unemployment increases they will turn against the minimum wage (as any job is better than none!).

And these cuts are inevitable with globalisation, because every nation must compete for international business, and so they all have to lower taxes and wages. This means that we must cut services or increase the national debt, these are both much the same for the latter will eventually lead to direct IMF involvement as we saw in Ireland, whilst the former is basically the same loss of national sovereignty but just less direct.

This race to the bottom will lead to the loss of all benefits and the privatisation of all services and resources. Already they've privatised the utility companies, the mines and the land, and now they are privatising higher education and the forests and they have plans to privatise core education, and perhaps eventually social security, the NHS and the BBC.

Yes, but my point is that they'll use the reforms to cripple the NHS, until it becomes either close to a private system itself or cannot compete with private competition.

true,starspangledpickle,eng-GreaterLondon,LONDON IS BEST. KNOW YOUR PLACE.,"""Information Technology"" is about as wide a net as ""Social Sciences"" is. To say there are useless degrees out there is certainly true for some things. But there is plenty of demand for people with less rigorous training in the theory of computing than Computer Science, such as people who want to be system administrators but are disinterested (or lack the interest in mathematics) to pursue CS directly.

A degree's worth to the business world, for that is what most people care about, and there are plenty of takers for IT jobs. People with IT degrees aren't the sort of who generally go unemployed in large numbers, regardless of whether it is a formal, and good, CS degree from a good redbrick or not.

There's a need for most degrees though I do agree with your overall sentiment that there are too many degrees that do not enhance a graduate's job prospects -- but if you happen to not be interested in that, then so what? 

No, we should do a better job helping people determine what to study in University now that it is treated as a ""fundamental right"" to do so. It is unfortunate that you need degrees to do most jobs (especially ones that do not need it) but that is the only decent criteria companies have when they have to sort through 500 job applications.

If people are studying golf course management and then going on to manage a golf course then is it any less valid that engineering? I will say that there are far too many people studying art. I was one of them. 90% of my course was getting wasted on a variety of fun substances, then wandering in on marking day and getting an A. While at the same time my flatmates who were doing math or engineering spent far more time in lectures or studying. And while this will probally be a very unpopular view, I would suggest that far too many people go to university simply as a way of putting off real life and the requirement to get a job.

So I would say this, if less people go to university then make it funded by general taxation. But if we have 50%+ of the relevant age group going to university then I don't see how this will be sustainable, especially if a large chunk of those people do no better than people who haven't been which is what I am seeing with the people I know.

Usually when we think of non violent protest we think of Gandhi yet we neglect the brutal fighting that many Indians endured and the control of the salt that meant they had some powerful leverage. Or how we are taught about Dr. Martin Luther King and often neglect the fact that without the Black Panther Party as a violent alternative to Dr. King's civil rights moment Dr. King would have never gotten the backing he eventually gained, seen as the better alternative to the Black Panther Party

I think that violence is sometimes needed, to paraphrase what [David Mitchell wrote last week ""at least it gets you noticed""](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/nov/28/student-protests-tuition-fees-clegg). Also sustained attacks cause economic damage, for example, the cost of policing violent protests is significantly higher than non violent and the clean up operation is also very costly. This hits governments where it hurts, the pocket. The government simply could not afford to keep paying for this and would eventually have to have a rethink.

However. I do not believe, when a crowd is surging towards the police, the people at the edge, that are being pushed by thousands should be hit for not  being able to resist them.

I do not believe, hours of exposure, and imprisonment, of many innocents is justified. They aren't allowed to crowd police cells that heavily, and they aren't allowed to keep people in cells without any toilets.

I do not beleive charging is justified at any speed, horse are lethal (just ask Christopher Reeve).

The worst part about all this, is I've seen another video (http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xg26u6_student-demonstration-london-09-12-2010_news#from=embed&amp;start=4 - not sure when exactly in the video it is) which showed children of 11 being in these crowds (in the video, they were told to go elsewhere to find an exit, rumours suggest they wouldn't of found, of course we do not know)

You are right, the question is about justification. And I can't see how it was justified.

When the Millbank attack happened, I felt sorry for the police (the closest example I can give of my comments on her is http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/e40cw/30000_pissed_students_on_london_streets/c154beg). I thought the protest should of remained peaceful. When they started using kettling, even more so when they started combining it with horse charges (Which is designed to disperse crowds, which they cant do in a kettle). When the maneuvered the kettles onto pretty much the most dangerous location I can think of in this weather (in the vicinity).

Not only that, they were doing this to *children*, I am not only disgusted at our police, I am digusted the goverment allows it, I am disgusted the media don't mention it. I am disgusted that I have seen no comment from the NSPCC or UNICEF about what, as far as I can see amounts to abuse of children

true,inglorious_basterd,null,null,"""Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent"" Is how your quote should read.

It depends on the momentum of a the protest I suppose. 

I think it may be a little misleading to suggest a protest has never achieved anything on its own, various successful revolutions (not that I think this student debate is on any comparable scale) have been born from protests. I see what you are saying, not by just a protest alone, but a protests are usually a lot of things not just 1 or 2 marches.

A violent protest is likely to push public opinion away, correct, but from what I have seen/heard it is deeply polarising opinions and many are in fact in support. Just from asking around my peers and non peers the supportive view seems strong, it appears to have grown because of the numerous peaceful protest's failure such as ""Stop the Iraq war"".

Violence towards building and non lethal fights with the police is not true violence, it's a useful, costly and persuasive tool. There is a line, and I don't think it has been or will be crossed in these protests.

Edit: I see you changed your quote to be correct as I have typed above, It would be nice to get a thanks. Also I put the correct quote as it changes its meaning somewhat.

Perhaps it was a bad example, the principle of universities running sub-par courses just for profit is legitimate though.

&gt;In Vodafone's case, the £6bn figure was an urban myth, according to both VF and HMRC. It also isn't clear whether or not the bill is a one-off or recurring - if it was the latter, why would the government say ""it's alright chaps, we won't need the country to take its medicine for a year as those fine people in Newbury are going to pay up""?

Those might be single costs, but they happen every year. And the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the PFI costs, etc. are certainly recurring costs.

&gt;Out of interest, do you buy stuff from Amazon? Play.com? Do you have an ISA? Tax avoidance happens, and everyone does it, from the wealthy to the poor.

Well I don't have an ISA, and I thought we _did_ pay VAT on goods purchased online? I see your point but you _do_ have to take in to account the relative magnitudes. I mean Phillip Green paid his wife 1.2 _billion_ pounds in dividends, that money is just unimaginable.

&gt;Like how Labour has a lot of Lords (I wonder how they got there) and other wealthy people to draw from when are a bit short on cash?

I agree. New Labour are just as bad, this isn't tribal politics, I'd rally against all the hypocrites equally, be it the Guardian's tax dodging, the racism of Diane Abbott, etc.

&gt;Privatising the NHS is electoral suicide 

Not really, already many people are turning against it, to the point where Dan Hannan MEP can openly oppose it and retain his seat. And they won't do it in one go, instead they'll do it slowly and carefully to avoid any major flashpoints. I think they'll use these NHS ""reforms"" to saddle the NHS with new bureaucracy, and then as it is burdened with the changes, let private competition outcompete it and point out how much more efficient the market is being until they have public support.

Amazon and Play both ship from Jersey (Amazon doesn't do it for everything - basically if they say it is coming from Indigo Starfish, it's Jersey) to avoid paying VAT and/or import taxes, I forget which. But it makes it cheaper for you compared to buying it from a UK-based company.

&gt; I mean Phillip Green paid his wife 1.2 billion pounds in dividends, that money is just unimaginable.

I agree. But I'm not sure if the government could clamp down on it. I believe that his wife technically owns the Arcadia group, and she is tax-resident in Monaco. All above board.

One problem with tax avoidance is that if you turn the heat up too much, they'll all go elsewhere. It's better to get 20% of billions than 100% of nothing at all.

Now, now, let's not conflate Labour with ""the left"". Really I support the ideas of Albert Einstein's [Why Socialism?](http://www.monthlyreview.org/598einstein.php) and the Communist Manifesto.  

The problem of hypocrisy and weakness is huge on the ""left-wing"" though, with people like Monbiot comparing Air Travel to child abuse and yet giving no real alternative, and all the bureaucratic unions and student parties not really presenting any viable ideas for change, the NUS, for example, is just as bad as the government, and the RMT is little better where Bob Crow makes a fortune whilst the workers have few benefits.

&gt;I think it's a little too soon to see what these reforms might do. I'm not a doctor or involved in the NHS, so I don't have enough knowledge to form an opinion.

Maybe, just the whole idea of reform is worrying though. Throughout the past 30 years it has only meant one thing: privatisation.

you invalidate any argument of yours by showing your lack of care for biodiversity. If you don't believe biodiversity to be important you shouldn't bother commenting on a topic like this under the pretence of environmentalism.

As an Earth Scientist long term thinking may be your forte but this issue requires short term assessment as well. Whilst you may think in the 1000s of years animal's life times (including my 'precious waders') are significantly shorter. A species that utilises the Severn Estuary in important numbers is the Eurasian Curlew, a near threatened species. The longevity record for Eurasian Curlew is 31 years. The species could easily become extinct over much shorter time periods than you are used to working with. It's relative the Slender Billed Curlew is another European wetland bird which is now suspected to be extinct. If in 1000 years there are no Curlews left due to destruction of their habitat (a real prospect) as well as many other animals in the ecosystems at risk by the barrage the question has to be asked should better alternatives have been sought, and I believe they should. A decision to allow the barrage could mean many more of these 'sacrifices' of species could be made in other controversial decisions about the energy future of the world.

The second protest they were only trying to keep the protesters to one side of the road so traffic could go down the other side, but students thought that they were gonna get kettled again and changed route and caused more chaos.

The third time they had to step it up because clearly people were looking for a fight (you don't just find fireworks in your pocket) and the crowds were much larger.

What I'm getting at is that the police have approached it differently each time, but the protesters (usually a minority) always seem to find an issue with authority. What people needs to happen is realise that police are always going to be there, as their job is to keep order and protect the public (including property etc) and that violence just leads to bad press.

They do achieve the desired effect which is crowd dispersion, and as you alluded to above if they had wanted to hurt people with horses they could have hospitalized many people.

I think we'll see a lot more intelligence based action taking place, people being nicked on their way to a protest etc. I'd like to seem more plain clothes police actually in the crowd myself, so the second someone opens up with a paintball gun or throws snooker balls they are taken out then and there, rather than being allowed to incite the crowd.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"If you look at Milbank they kinda kettled themselves in the courtyard area. People at the back were trying to push forward to get into the building and a thin line of police at the front vainly trying to hold them back. I think in that particular instance they police just wanted them to leave. 

The best example of how kettling works was during the 2nd march. The initially started by blocking some routes the protesters wanted to take, which resulted in a mass of police in choke points and a crowd that tapered away from closed packed fighting to nothing at the other side. Once the trouble had started they just methodically sectioned the protest into blocks. After that it all breaks down. Kettling is supposed to be a case of you just keep them in one area until they calm down and slowly let them out, and in some cases it does work. However when the crowd just gets more angry they can't just let them go because the fear is they will just walk around a corner and start up again. Maybe because it was mostly teenagers and young people this didn't work because they simply have more energy and a teenage air of invulnerability? When it's used against football violence it seems to work far more often.

So the big problem with kettling is now you have everyone penned off, what do you do with them? If you just let them all go at once then you run the risk that they will just carry on with whatever they were doing. They need to find a way of dispersing the crowd calmly. How they do this beyond free cannabis smoke grenades I don't know, but this is where the problem is, not with kettling itself.

Also, Konchesky..... christ. At the very least, he needs to be given a spell on the bench so he has some time off from the criticism. I've never been a fan, but he must be better than this.

Democracy is not about leaving the government to do whatever they want once the polling stations close, and not saying or doing a thing about it until the next election.

Violence on the part of a minority does not invalidate the entire argument, in fact to even suggest it does is highly undemocratic. That violence did happen shows how badly this issue has been dealt with by those voted into parliament.

I am very used to seeing the actions of a few used to tarnish the arguments of a larger number, it is a common tactic to dismiss valid arguments, and it appears to work very well. The danger is that as it is used more often, those excluded become larger in number, and as they continue to be ignored, their anger gets worse. The violence gets worse.

Much better to engage with the disaffected now, to show them that their concerns are being heard, and to try and work with them.

It's a very very long story. The overview of which is I used to be very christian republican like my mom (used to listen to Bill O' Riley, even read his book when I was 16 or 17) and as such had just assumed that, well, since I didn't like men *the way I was supposed to* I must be A. sick or B. asexual.

Then I met Kelly. We used to draw together with 6 other artists every night on this java applet where people could collaborate in real time. I'd always been gaga over British accents, her [work](http://marinayoshi.deviantart.com) was amazing and we hit it off as close friends right away. We went on like that and through skype for a good year before I started to realize I felt different about her. Without getting into details I called her through the international operator (the call would later cost me about $500, oops, I didn't know better at the time) and asked her if she could wait for me. She had been dropping hints she was interested for the last few months and thankfully for my confused ass she said yes.

Ever since and all through university I've worked part-time at ridiculous hours so we could have a few weeks or months together now and then. We talk and draw together most every day and the times we spent together have been the best of my life. The transition here was... difficult to say the least, but even after 4 years of fighting to stay close I'm very thankful and happy to have her in my life. 

She makes me very happy, spoils me, kicks my ass when I'm being an idiot and forgives me for it when I come around, and that's the kind of person I need in my life. I'm willing to leave my country behind for it. (though our recent elections have made the choice that much easier, plus I've just always loved England and the UK)

FTA:

&gt; And this ""solution"" is, of course, nothing of the sort. The idea that you solve a deficit caused by unemployment by cutting jobs is economically illiterate.

Well, un-needed jobs (5-a-day coordinator for local councils?) will be cut as part of a wider set of cuts, and it's probably fair to say that some ""wanted but not vital"" jobs will go too - but that's not the core of things, it's just one part. Furthermore, given that - say - cutting 10,000 non-productive civil service jobs and having those people being forced in to productive jobs (e.g. the bloated MOD purchasing department bodies moving in to working at tescos) actually *will* have a positive effect on the economy, and therefore you and I.

&gt; I've tried explaining that the Treasury's debt really isn't that big: it was bigger for most of the 20th century, and, compared to the size of our economy, is one of the lowest on earth.

Well, that's because it was the deficit (PSBR) that was the bulk of issue, not the debt, well that and the fact that the world entered a recession meaning that we, as a country, had a lot less cash to spend due to cratering tax revenues. Add to the mix that no-one *has* to lend us money, we rely on purchasers of bonds to want to buy them and the proceeds from selling them are the equivalent of our bank loan. If there is any doubt that inflation may erode bond coupon or principal payments then the coupon price (the bit tied to interest rates) will have to go up to make the bonds more attractive again and that lands us (the UK) with a much higher cost of borrowing. Not a good thing when money is tight.

&gt; I've tried to explain that most of the debt is owed to people in the UK: our pension funds buy government bonds. If, as the Tories predict, borrowing did get more expensive, that would just mean that Britain's pension funds would get fatter - money the Treasury could tax back.

Two parts on that one. The debt isn't mostly held by UK bond-holders, a big chunk is but (from the last conversation I had about bonds with someone in that game) the majority are foreign held.  Japan represents one extreme (mostly domestically held) and the USA the other extreme. 
The second bit, if you re-read the the article lines again, you'll see someone making cash out of thin air (the [No Free Lunch principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_ain't_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch) applies everywhere).

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"Gusfoo has it pretty much spot on. To add to what he said, there are two schools of thought on cuts. There's the 'trim the fat' view, or 'hack and slash' if you want to take it to an extreme, that reducing the costs when money's tight so that you spend less than you borrow is generally a good thing, then there's the big state view, that the state can create things (jobs, money) out of thin air, which to some extent is true but not without acquiring resources (either through taxes or borrowing money).

What's happened since 1997 is that Labour have gone down the big state route, and used that to push a particular ideological agenda. The tories have always been small state and are effectively trying to reduce the cost while at the same time cutting out the labour programmes they don't like. There's also an ideological need for the tories to reduce the size of the state as they know they're only going to be there for so long before they're kicked out, so you may as well make hay while the sun shines as far as they're concerned. To some extent, the lib dems are acting as a brake on all of this, but looking at the tuition fees debacle what could've been used as an opportunity to create leverage against the tories for use elsewhere is now resulting in a negative reaction to (and within) the lib dems that could destabilise them. Ultimately this benefits the tories in some ways and works against them in others. If the coalition collapses, it's unlikely that Labour will get back in (although not impossible) but there'd also be a collapse in Lib Dem support as they're seen to have sold out to the tories. The tories will also see some people support them and others leave them for various reasons, but you know what you're getting with the tories (whether you like it or not, you know what to expect), it's the lib dems that are uncertain.

I'm not suggesting one approach is better than another (although personally I'm in the trim the fat camp rather than the big state camp, but there are benefits and drawbacks with both approaches).",0,1292169798,null,0,false,0,c18rymd,t3_ekhkr,t1_c18rymd,t3_ekhkr,null,1426626650,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

Entire services will have to be got rid of to accommodate these cuts. Policemen, parole worker, social workers will all lose their jobs. 

This first part, I completely agree with. As I said, the cuts *will* fall on some wanted-but-not-vital jobs. A damn shame too. Not enough of a shame to stay the executioners hand, though. *shrug*

&gt; This is not about efficiency, this is a deliberate attempt to shrink the state and hand large sections of the economy over to the private sector in the belief that the market will deliver the goods because the market can never go wrong.

Well, yes - but in fairness this is at the end of a time where the state was expanded massively by the previous Government and decision making was centrallised across the board. It's bound to look like a slash-and-burn without that key element of contextualisation.

And yes, also, the markets screwed up - the world entered a recession, the US housing crisis occurred and it's been hell since then. I'm not sure though that that is damning enough to completely lose faith in capitalism though. Everything has problems from time-to-time and (hopefully at least) we learn from our mistakes and don't repeat them.

&gt; The real point though is that debt is not the big problem in our economy at the moment - it's unemployment. To try and solve that problem by simultaneously making another 1 million people unemployed and cutting services to help people find work is astoundingly dumb

Is it though? I'm not belittling unemployment but I question that it's No1, and having just come out of a short-ish period where I was living on Job Seekers allowance then I have a firm respect and sympathy for people in those circumstances - but we (the British) have become dependent for the structure of the state, on borrowing from the markets. Nothing, *nothing* takes precedence over that. Normally, of course, it's so business-as-usual that no-one takes any notice. Come recession time and a plunging pound then the Bond Vigilantes come out to play. We have very few guiding lights to follow this time around, this recession around. Should we follow the USA and try to spend our way out of the recession, but risk becoming like Japan with a decade of QE and little to show for it. 

What would you do differently?

&gt; Finally - on the bonds - aren't you simply repeating what the author describes as Osbourne's mistake i.e. the idea that foreign investors would be put off from buying our bonds unless we made massive cuts when in fact they were keen to buy them long before any cuts were made?

I don't know if I'm just repeating - I hope I've added at least a little. That aside, what you have is the issue of asymmetric information, they were buying our bonds without knowledge of how fucked we were. As soon as it became clear just how fucked we were then prices ticked up and needed to be brought down. Hell - people were buying 10year Greek notes for years and demanding just a few basis points above Bunds. Now we know what we know, would *you* lend Greece money at Bunds + ?bp - and what is ""?""

true,essjay2009,cnty-wales,Bristol,"Two things strike me about this article. 

Firstly, the implication that a director of ICT means that development will be done in house. Even if hounding have developers on your payroll, you still need someone to oversee ICT. The fact that they are asking for someone with public sector experience implies to me that they want someone with experience of an environment where outsourcing is common. Managing ICT in an environment where most things are outsourced presents all sorts of challenges. 

The other thing is the fact they are complaining about the wage. Without knowing exactly, roughly Market rate, probably a little under based on the baseless assumption the author made that it will be similar to David Cameron's. Considering how badly SLC has performed recently, with IT issues being particularly common, why would you not want to get a competent person in to sort it all out. Pay peanuts, get monkeys and all that. 

And something else which really annoys me is this idea of comparing people's pay to that of the prime minister. The prime minister position is underpaid substantially. Even considering the fringe benefits. You couldn't imagine a mid level manager at a company of a comparable size to the UK's economy being on that little pay.

On Christmas Eve, we'll go down town and walk through the park, taking in all the lights and hanging out together. Then we'll come home for some hot apple cider and the kid will open one present. That present is traditionally always new pajamas. After she's in bed, hubby and I will watch *It's a Wonderful Life*, after which, the kid will be out cold, so we'll set out the presents before heading to bed ourselves.

The kid will have us up early on Christmas morning and we'll get a fire going in the fire place while we make some tea and wake up a bit. Then we all sit around the tree and pass out presents to each other-they get opened one at a time. The dogs will try and help and there will be much yelling of ""Elvis, leave it!""

After that, we clean up wrapping paper and boxes and then we all cook a big breakfast together.

After Breakfast, we'll take the dogs out for some play-time/walks, and then we'll play games together if we got any new family games (we generally always get one), and the kid will play with her toys for a while, etc.

Then we'll watch a movie - having decided on *Star Wars: A New Hope* for this year. 

After the movie, it's time for Christmas dinner, so we'll head over to my dad's house and have dinner with him, my step mom, step-brother, niece, and 2 nephews. Outside of immediate family, we only do gifts for the kids, so we'll watch the four little ones open up another present or two apiece. 

After we come home from that, it's Doctor Who time! I will have, uhm, acquired the special while we were at my dad's for dinner. We'll turn off all the lights, watch the Christmas special, and then watch it again, then collapse into bed.

I think it's much more a case of holding government etc. accountable .

However I would like to point out that people who base themselves externally are people who are easily manipulated by the authorities . Google is certainly a means to this end . However social networking sites such as Facebook , Twitter etc. - are very much at the forefront of this . The authorities have been changing the culture of the last three decades to produce exactly that such situation .

So when you go on about Google , Facebook , Twitter etc. - just remember that the establishment - the authorities - may be very strongly pulling your chain .

My personal opinion. I find water cannons pointless and explained my method of containment would involve a larger perimeter with a two line system. The first assessing those within the crowd, letting small groups of co-operative protesters through who can then filter out the second line. The idea of this is, it eases the pressure on groups and separates the thugs from actual protesters.

The BBC reporters ‘embedded’ with the students/protestors (Iwas waiting for them to use that word) are hardly impartial – they are a disgrace. At least SKY focused on what the police officers were actually facing.
Surely it is NOW time for water cannon. The violence of the ‘criminal scum’ at Victoria St/P-Sq – scene of the mounted charge is staggerring and the barrier tactics and positioning failed.
Police officers clearly do not have a mandate nor the ability to perform properly with a reporter/camera-person, CITIZEN JOURNALIST, film crew or LEGAL OBSERVER/Human Rights Lawyer on every side.
I understand that the MPS are looking to be dealing with these parasites well into the night and possibly tomorrow.
I hope these scumbags die of exposure in the meantime AND that the PC who has a ‘serious neck injuries’ is ultimately OK.

It wraps up somewhat nicely with the fact that the Time Lords were almost exclusively non-interventionists so there isn't much to be undone.

But, from the clues we've seen I don't think being time locked is quite as permanent as the cracks in time. Jack still remembered the Daleks, although that could partially be explained by the fact that he's a time traveler. In Flesh and Stone the Doctor tells Amy that she can still remember the soldiers that were lost because time travelers see the universe in a different way.

However, the asshole that Rose lost to on The Weakest Link in The Parting of the Ways has heard of the Daleks (...they disappeared thousands of years ago...). A handful of people remember the Time Lords, for example the Shadow Proclamation, the Krillitane (School Reunion), and the Sontarans. 

If I had to guess, ""time locked"" means past versions of each participant is removed from time and space (so the Doctor couldn't go back and find Romana while she was traveling with 4, for instance) but the effects of all the participants aren't removed. Any civilizations the Daleks destroyed are still gone, any paradoxes the time lords fixed still didn't happen.

In light of the recent 'attack' on the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, you have cleared the use of water canons by the Police to deter 'rioters' (AKA, 'Protestors').

First of all, the 'attack' would not have happened had who ever was stupid enough to direct an un-armoured Rolls Royce into a pack of protesters not done so.

Why have you cleared the use of water canons for the police? Are you willing to bring these kind of occurrences into our country?

I've liked a few acts that have come from The X Factor, and I think that Matt Cardle has a heck of a voice, but what I really appreciate from The X Factor is its response. If The X Factor didn't exist then people wouldn't feel the need to support other, genuine acts during Christmas. As the article suggests, it produces a strong underground resentment, and if anything I think music brewing from that underground could have the potential to be very good.

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"This argument, in context, falls down for me for quite a few reasons. ( FTR I work in this industry ) 

1. Primetime TV programming slots will always be watched, so it's a ready made audience. 

2. Drivetime radio slots will always be listened to, it's also a ready made audience. 

3. A complete monopoly over the British press Red Top entertainments sections.  FTR my GF is an editor for the Mirror ( so kill me, she's hot ) and we've had lengthy conversations about this. Now the Mirror being the kind of paper it is,  if they don't put x-factor on the cover, they don't sell papers. End of. It's too ingrained in the publics perception of what family entertainment actually is/should be that if you don't cover it, you're seen to be 'not in the fold,' you therefore lose sales. 


4. Kids will assimilate anything musically that's force fed to them in such a massive way, especially when it's from a catalogue of already proven and road tested Sony Music hit records, the parents in-turn will buy the shit created to satisfy the demand from their nagging kids. Music business 101: if you get the kids involved and liking your product, everything else thereafter falls nicely into place. 

5. And this is the key to how it all works. The whole x-factor/pop idol/Britain's Got Talent etc etc formula plays to a very calculated methodology i.e. normal everyday person gets a break, is flung into the limelight and becomes a star. It's classic fairytale stuff and people suck it up by the bucket load. The catalyst I will add is always the prize money or the chance of winning £1million and a sorted life, which FTR is a complete bullshit force fed lie, the winning artist get nowhere near this amount on signing, in fact they get ripped off, used and flung in the gutter once their natural shelf life has been milked for all it's worth. 19 management, Syco, Cowell etc etc know this to be a fact and are going to continue playing this card for their own financial gain till it's worn out. It's media saturation and brainwashing to a scripted formula of the highest order, using Sony's collection of back catalogue already road-tested ""hits"" to facilitate the job. 

And that's about the size of it really. It's basically an entertainments scam and media monopoly.

I agree.  I think crouch shines at set pieces and being at the end of crosses.  The only thing that makes sense, I think the announcer said, was that he was being brought on to block Drogba on set pieces.  Either way, it was a bizarre move because Crochs offensive strengths were not of ultimate value this weekend, as most of our threatening attacks came right down the center of the pitch.  

I can sort of see where Harry was coming from, but at the same time we all knew we would see Drogba eventually and with Spurs record of conceding goals a more offensive minded approach would have been helpful because we all knew that we were not going to hold onto a clean sheet.

I personally like BAE and Hutton running up the flanks getting into the attack, I think Hutton is a better attacker than BAE but it still makes the game that much more entertaining, which is one of the reasons I watch soccer.

It is interesting to note that during the high of the riots in the 80's, Thatcher considered banning re-enactments as it was training people to fight as a unit. Never came to anything though.

As for the ring of rope, I think that would be a disaster as well. You see black bloc people in the videos from the Pittsburgh riots trying this with some sort of mobile protest enclosure. It just reduced mobility and they couldn't run away when the cops tear gassed them. 

At the end of the day, if you want to go out and fight the police you need to keep mobile and in small groups. If you try and go in like something out of Gladiator you will not win, and most likely the people who will get hurt will be the people who had nothing to do with the violence.

What is your point here anyway? Why don't you explain why I am wrong?

If you want to earn more over your life, or attempt, you have to _invest_ in yourself. Similar to a business investment. There is _no_ such thing a free lunch and students are deluded into this fact.

Protesting at the increase? laughable... wait until they enter the real world - the difference from the new system to the old is _peanuts_ in value. Absolute peanuts. *Students* all over the world would kill for the chance to study and incur debt which is paid off _when_ you're earning.

You will not make a difference to the way policing works or the student fees by going to protest. Do it in a more constructive manner, without exchanging blows.

However, here's some food for thought if you still plan on protesting...

Instead, focus on **peaceful** mass occupations of parliament square. Look to Ghandi and MLK as examples, not black bloc tactics. One of the core tenants of MLK's approach was to be peaceful at all times, no matter what. This was to prove that no matter what was done to black people they would not rise to it. In the context of the student protests, 20000 students doing nothing more that sitting down around parliament will cause chaos, but if the police use any force it looks disproportionate. And if they just leave you alone then it's 20000 students slowly freezing to death live on TV.

I grew up watching Tom Baker and remember him fondly, but last year I rented a DVD of one of his episodes and I simply couldn't sit through it because it was so bad, and not because of Tom Baker. What we expect from a TV show is so much more now.

While the three latest Doctors are all great in acting ability, David Tennant's character was one people connect with better because of the dialogue and character he presented. 

Eccleston's mantra was, 'Everything has its time. Everything dies.'  Tennant had many memorable opposing lines, such as, ""You want weapons? We’re in a library! Books! The best weapons in the world!"" 

Even when Tennant turned dark in The Waters of Mars, when he's talking to Adelaide Brooke, he remarked that she could have shot Andy, and potentially saved the Mars base, but she didn't. ""I loved you for that,"" he said. Tennant's anti-violence talk and emphasis on always giving his enemy a last chance are things that Tennant fans *really* like, especially parents wanting appropriate video content to show their kids.

Edit: And I'm sure there's something to Tennant's Doctor falling in love and losing that love that plays into fan sentimentality.

I'm not sure what Matt Smith's Doctor is about yet. Moffat has to find character elements that really resonate with people besides the Doctor being a nice guy.

Throwing a piece of wood at a horses head is just cruel and cannot be condoned.

Some other things which can't be condoned:

* Beating a man around the head so that he requires brain surgery;
* Pulling a disabled man from his wheel chair;
* Charging horses at unarmoured and mostly unarmed crowds containing children;
* Having skittish animals such as horses and dogs around an angry crowd at all;
* Dragging people out of a croud, manhanding them to the ground and then holding them down while they are beaten about the legs and back with batons;
* Attacking people on the ground as they are trying to stand up and get away;
* Forcing the peaceful demonstration up the road to join the angry, kettled demonstration in a more sensitive place (parliament square)

Equally:

* Bringing snooker balls and flares with the intent of throwing them at the police;
* Throwing those things and broken breeze blocks and barriers at the police;
* Causing large amounts of property damage, including graffitiing a statue of Winston Churchill
* Breaking windows on the treasury and supreme court

Also:

* Passing unfair, damaging and economically unsound legislation regarding tuition fees when there is a 30,000 strong protest against precisely that outside;
* Introducing a bill on and then voting for something which directly contradicts a pre-election pledge made seperately and specifically apart from the manifesto because it was believed to be so important;
* calling people who beat unarmed and unarmoured citizens with sticks ""heroes""

I saw all of these ~~last night and this morning~~ at the time on the news. I was watching the BBC not sky, but the footage was probably fairly similar.

Most likely not intentional, no one likes a body count.

&gt; Pulling a disabled man from his wheel chair;

It looks like a dick move, but I want to know more about the incident. Technically you can be arrested for as little as swearing at a cop, and being in a wheel chair doesn't give you a pass on this one.

&gt; Charging horses at unarmoured and mostly unarmed crowds containing children;

I don't have a problem with using horses to disperse a crowd. Unless they actually do a proper cavalry charge, which so far we've not seen.

&gt; Having skittish animals such as horses and dogs around an angry crowd at all;

Horses and dogs have been used for crowd control for centuries, again I have no problem with this.

&gt; Dragging people out of a croud, manhanding them to the ground and then holding them down while they are beaten about the legs and back with batons;

If your causing trouble in a crowd, I don't have a problem with snatch teams removing the trouble makers. Usually before they incite others is the best time to do this. Additionally, protest being arrested before or after you are arrested, but during the actual arrest process is going to cause you grief. If the police are trying to arrest you, go with it unless you have a very good chance of getting away.

&gt; Attacking people on the ground as they are trying to stand up and get away;

Not seen this one on the news I've seen.

&gt; Forcing the peaceful demonstration up the road to join the angry, kettled demonstration in a more sensitive place (parliament square)

Got any more info on this?

&gt; Passing unfair, damaging and economically unsound legislation regarding tuition fees when there is a 30,000 strong protest against precisely that outside;

I disagree with this. Although the debt is higher than before, the way it's repaid is better for graduates. As I've said elsewhere, as an ex-student I don't really know how much I owe, but I do know how much they take each month. When I was starting my career (and I'll be honest, now), repaying less per month over a longer period would have been far better. The way the loan is repaid is much fairer than it was under the system I am beholden to. 

&gt; Introducing a bill on and then voting for something which directly contradicts a pre-election pledge made seperately and specifically apart from the manifesto because it was believed to be so important;

The pre-election pledge was a stupid idea made from the luxury of never having anything to do with something we all knew was on the cards before the election. (There was a reason the Browne report was commissioned by labour prior to the election.) My biggest problem with the pledge was that it was an utterly stupid thing to promise people when they knew it was unaffordable, and the only reason it was done was because they thought they would come 3rd as usual.

&gt; calling people who beat unarmed and unarmours citizens with sticks ""heroes""

Using animals to control a crowd for centuaries is not a good enough reason to do something. Using a crowd dispersal tactic on a kettled crowd is just stupid - it is a wonder people were not trampled! Dogs are dangerous carnivores. Horses are large, powerful, skittish animals. Being on a horse gives you more mobility and a better viewpoint - a helicopter and a raido will achieve both far more effectively! The police do not need to use these animals and it is not fair on either the potestors or the animals to do so. It was clear from some of the news footage that the horses were not comnfortable in that environment. 

Dragging trouble makers out of a crowd is not unreasonable. Holding them down and beating them is. I saw this specifically happen on the BBC coverage. Likewise attacking people on the grond as they tried to stand up and get away from the crazed lunatic with a baton and a police uniform! 

As to forcing one kettle into another: 

&gt; A group of marchers remain ""kettled"" on Whitehall, where police are seemingly trying to push them towards Parliament Square. There is no telling when they might be let out.

from [here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/blog/2010/dec/09/student-protests-live-coverage) at 6:34pm. Best I can do off the cuff I'm afraid. 

I am well aware of the arguments for and against this bill. The perception of the huge debt will likely put people off, even if the lower repayments and earlier writeoff are actually a benefit. If they do not they condition people to having huge debts, which is part of what cvaused the financial meltdown in the first place! In the short term the plans will do nothing to reduce government spending, in the medium term more debt will be written off meaning less in the education budgets, and in the long term there will be less well educated people because less people will have degrees. Add to that the dropping of the EMA meaning that people currently in further education will have serious probloems (there are a significant number of families where that 30 quid a week is literlally holding the family together!) This is why I feel is it unfair, damaging and economically unsound, I am not basing my opinings purely on the headline figure. 

The pre-election pledge may or may not have been stupid, but it was made and it did win them voites. Those who voted for the lib dems based on those proposals feel agrieved, I think justly.

EMA was put in place to encourage people to stay in education, but since staying in education will become mandatory in 2013 anyway it no longer has to encourage people to stay in education. What is being done is learning support funds are being increased to help those who as you pointed out are reliant on the £30 a week extra. The only debate is around how many people actually need that £30, and how many people just like to have it.

As for education and degree's, since tuition fees were introduced the number of people attending university has increased from 10% to near 50%. The only issue is that this has massively devalued the degree, and formerly degree only jobs now require masters while jobs which don't really require a degree level education are asking for one. Simply having more graduates isn't an answer. We actually need more vocational and trade skills which were provided by polytechnics, while academic courses don't always provide the best training for the skills people need in life. Education for educations sake is nice, but for the majority of people education is a path into working and I don't think the current system is working for that end.

No, I don't universally view colorization as improving on the creative intent of the original minds involved.  Citizen Kane should probably stay as it is, and the various Special Editions of Star Wars are various layers of crap.  But those examples are cases in which the original work was a carefully crafted, highly polished work.  This was never the case with early Doctor Who, and hardly ever the case even right up to 1989.

The earliest episodes of Doctor Who were as-live pantomime theatre for children who were used to summer repertory theatre.

It would serve as another layer of imagery for the public face of the non-violent contingent of the demonstation, and make the inevitable stand-off-til-nightfall more bearable for those caught up in it.

I'd even advocate the use of high-back comfortable leather chairs, newspapers, cigars and brandy, such as in a gentleman's club. All in a circle, backs to the front line.

Hell, why not bring text books and organise the largest sit-down study group ever?

Violent protest is of course weighted heavily in the police's favour. Taking on any army that possesses (or is allowed to possess) superior weapons technology on thier own terms is futile. Engaging the media and making the public look upon kettling as ridiculous takes the initiative from the police tacticians and into the protestors'. Heads will still likely be bloodied, as shown in the G20 peace camp breakups, but the impact on external observers would be significant in the student's cases.

Strength of public opinion would be my weapon of choice.

true,lackofbrain,cnty-uk,Nowhere in particular,"Okay, I watched the rest of it. My assesment of the programme:

It was very biased. It showed several arrests from the UAF side, most of whom were complaining about being arrested, not least because they were being treated extremely roughly. One guy was being held, pinned against a pillar so he couldn't move and was told to stop struggling repeatedly, then told to stop crying. They showed one arrest from the EDL side which was of someone who pretty much came quietly. It did not show anyone in a good light with the possible exception of the EDL who didn't come across as whiney like the UAF or briutal like the police. But then the EDL understand the media better than the UAF or the police - The spokespeolple they shose for the UAF were whiney or out of touch; The spokespeople for the EDL knew what they wanted to say and looked more ""normal""

My opinion of the police after that:

If anything, worse. They were without fail arrogant and self-riteous. They were actively aiming for violence in some instances, and seemed to enjoy the power they had, and worse, seemed to enjoy hurting people. They considered themselves better than either side. 

My opinion of the tactics used there from that film:

They made reference to just how dangerous the dogs are in that film. They should be allowed to use dogs. Their tactics were tame compared to what we saw last thursday. There were some aspects shown which seemed to be verging on excessive force, but I would need more information before I could say otherwise. However it was very clear that what any normal perswon would consider excessive force the police involved would not, and the law may inexplicably back them up on that (they certainly believed so). 

Final conclusions: 

That show did nothing to improve my opinion of the filth we call riot police, if anything it worsened it.

If I may, there is no ""perception filter"" on the TARDIS.  The TARDIS appears to anyone that cares to notice it as a Police Public Call Box from the 1960's.  The exterior is not hidden in any way.

The TARDIS has a Chamelion Circuit which is supposed to disguise it as something appropriate for the era and place, but is broken and ALWAYS take the shape of a Police Public Call Box.

&gt;Three TARDIS keys, all with low level perception filters, because the TARDIS is designed to blend in. 

Also, a leftover bit of the TARDIS's perception filter is used to hide Torchwood's elevator. [Quoting from wikipedia:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Changes_(Torchwood\)#Continuity)

&gt; The spot in Roald Dahl Plass where the TARDIS landed in ""Boom Town"" possesses a ""perception filter"" that prevents anyone outside from noticing anything inside. Jack's explanation is that ""a dimensionally transcendental chameleon circuit placed right on this spot… welded its perception properties to a spatio-temporal rift""

As far as why Ian and Barbara didn't notice, if I remember right the trip to the stone age in Unearthly Child, ""...why didn't it change this time?"", is when it first broke. It's possible the chameleon circuit and the perception filter were both broken and the Doctor hadn't noticed yet. Post-Unearthly Child he manages to fix the perception filter but not the chameleon circuit. Like anything Doctor Who not stated explicitly though, anyone's guess is equally to be right.

It was showed from the police persepctive and yet still showed them as contemptible, arrogant bullies. From that and other experiences with the filth it would appear that the general culture in the force is to encourage that.

I can see why it happens - they are surrounded every day by the worst people in society (and for a change I am not referring to the poilice here!), those who cause large amounts of harm to themselves and others. They are tasked with protecting society from these people. These people don't want their help. It is therefore very easy to take an ""I know best"" attitude, and when you couple that with the amount of force they are legally allowed to dole out, and the relative  difficulty of prossecuting a policeman for anything he does (up to and including assaulting unarmed, defenceless people in police cells) it is very easy to get arrogant. 

The fact it can easily be explained, hopwever, does not excuse it. The fact is it is so god-damned obvious means something should be done to try to *prevent* it. The easiest thing to do would be to make them accountable to the people they are supposed to be serving, and that means not rendering them immune from prossecution, and removing the protection from being prossecuted for incompetence (the police cannot be prossecuted for incompetence in the same way as any other professionsal). The otehr thing that desperately needs doing is to actually fund the IPCC properly. I happened to come across their annual report earlier this year - they directly investigate less than 1% of all cases referred to them, the remainder are either dismissed (some should be no doubt), or sent back to the same police force being investigated to investigate, with varying level of IPCC oversight. 

I therefore suggest the following to help aleviate the problems:

* Remove the protections from incompetence prossecution 
* Masssively reduce the number of crimes so the police have less to do
* Massively reduce police powers so the police can do less
* Cut the national policing budget by 10% and give that money directly to the IPCC",0,1292330743,null,0,false,0,c190mid,t3_ejgkz,t1_c190mid,t1_c190e5h,null,1426630757,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

When the police fail to act through incompetence or cause harm through incompetant actiosn then, like any otehr profession (e.g. doctors, lawyers, firemen) they should be prosecutable. They are not. This was decided by the house of lords (before the supreme court came into existance) on the grounds that everyone who ever had any contact with them would complain about their incompetence. That is a near-direct quote from a lawyer by the way. 

Most of the time the IPCC do not have the resources to investigate things directly themselves. They pass the complaint back to internal affairs of the force being complained about, with varyiong levels of oversight from them taking a look at the complaint afterwards to see if any investigation was done up to having one of their people reviewing things as they happen. However as they are massively underfunded they almost always go for one of the lower oversight options because it's cheaper rather than becasue it's the best option. 

The police should be stripped of all stop and search powers, partularly those that do not require suspicion (yes Thersa May has stopped granting it in areas, but the law needs repealing, and the ""acting suspiciously"" is still a good enough reason). 

They need to stop being able to take DNA from all arrest victims, and be limited to only those cases where it is directly relevant (preferably requiring a warrant to do so). They need to dispose of all innocent people's DNA from the database, and the DNA of anyone convicted of a crime where DNA was in no way relevant (e.g. computer fraud). The power to charge people of some minor offences Theresa May granted them also needs to be removed from them again. 

Those two things would be a good start and might help to restore trust in the police service. On that note, stop calling it a police *force* and start calling it a police *service* becasue that is what it should be. Also stop calling them officers because that implies superiorirty which is not deserved.

His spirit was a way of coping with his dark side, where with 11 I get the feeling his spirit is in spite of his dark side.

However, it seems now he has changed his tactics/mindset but the players are in such poor form. Against Newcastle Roy did nothing wrong..hmm except for waiting to long to make a sub, but tactically it was fine. It was the players fault we lost that game.

So maybe more time is needed?
Or just get someone who has flair and wants to play attractive attacking football....

So far I've been incredibly disappointed with the organisation of these events, there's been little structure at all, I've been part of many demonstrations over the years as I was previously a pretty active  punk/anarchist/whatever you want to label me as, these protests have been some of the worst organised I've ever seen. Had these events been properly managed and organised in the first place there probably wouldn't have been much if any violence at all.

Not that I'm saying the police response has been right here at all, they've handled it just as badly and I'm very surprised that nobody has been killed yet.

I would not recommend anyone to allow any relatives that can't handle themselves or have the foresight to get out of a situation that looks like it's going to explode to not allow them to attend. I'd say if you're under 17, pregnant, disabled in any way or unfit, you shouldn't be attending. The protests to come are only going to get more violent as anger with the police rises.

If things aren't handled and organised properly soon there's going to be real violence with proper police clashes, so far there's only been small minor scuffles. Police lines having projectiles thrown at them and small bands of protesters trying to stop them advancing a kettle.

On the day the invasion started, there should have been organised civil disobedience to block roads, offices, schools, city centres and economically bring the country to a halt.

Once it was seen that British involvement, despite such a huge public mandate against it, would cost the country more than it has to participate and inspire disobedience on such a large scale, the govt would have been pulling troops back to the UK faster than seen at Dunkirk.

Instead, the military complex got its war, the oil companies got control of Iraqi resources and a couple of years back, the bankers got their bail outs yet there are now massive cutbacks in public services which will directly effect all of the poor and vulnerable in society so that the rich can have more tax breaks on the little amounts they pay.

I suggest the reason violence has gradually increased is because the government is outright ignoring the people who are protesting - the people their actions directly influence. It is granted that not all protesters would stop if they did this, but there are many who are inflamed due to the ignorance of the government - they have a ""let's do it and be damned about the consequences"" attitude on the exterior.

If they ban marches, I would be interested to know if that is legal under EU law. I feel removing the power to demonstrate in a democratic system will pour petrol onto the flames already and almost certainly hurt the government on their civil liberties platform they boasted about while they were talking about being against ID cards.

even in the US this level of crime and risk of suicide gets you barred for owning firearms.

from what i have read his wife was sacked from the school which he had issues with along with his history of possessiveness with women.

its reported that he has been suicidal but in the video you hear the board member say:

""i dont want anyone to get hurt, and I've got a feeling what you want if for the cops to come in and kill you because you are mad, because you have said you are going to die today""

the man was a mental disturbed suicidal individual that was probably banned from owning a firearm due to his record.

Immigrants depress wages especially in the areas where working class men are most likely to be employed (building and construction for instance).

There is a perception that immigrants get more than locals in terms of government spending (for instance access to social housing).

ill start with the 64K incidence per year figure first. this seems very low compared with a many other sources.

http://gunowners.org/op0206.htm estimates 2.5million i know not the most unbiased source but with guns and gun control there are VERY few unbiased sources for either side.

http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcdguse.html list 3 studdies that have a range of estimates 

* 800,000 to 2.5 million 
* 1.5 million
* 108,000 DGU's annually

so the reports range greatly. and yes i can agree that the US has higher rates of gun related death/injures and crime but when you look at the stats its doesn't seem as mad as its made out in the press.

they have 90% of the population to gun ratio meaning there are several hundred million guns in the us bigger than any if not all army's in the world combined. they have had far grater racial discrimination and far wider ratios of wealth to poverty for decades. they also have a far lower standard of health care services for the poor of there society.

the standards of wealth and equality and now basic health care have improved over the last decade and the number of gun ownership has actually risen over the same time and as a whole they have a reduction in crime baring a few states which seem to have actually had stronger anti gun laws. so gun numbers allown are not the course its a much wider issue.

the comparison of Columbine V this antecedence also don't favor gun control at all.

Columbine was a gun free zone were no legal law abiding staff or student could carry a firearm. an area where a criminal with a deranged mental state simply ignored the law and went in with a gun. this is sadly why many schools and picked as targets as they legally cant shoot back.

the school board incident was stooped by a security guard, this is a citizen not police just a citizen payed to do a basic job who has a private firearm. the guard was not in the board meeting room but was notified when all the hostages came out and when the man started shooting he enters the room and stops any loss of life bar the gun mans own self inflicted injury.

lets make that clear the gun man would not have been stooped by police they were not there he has a criminal record for firearms offenses so would be banned from owning them he got of 3 missed shots before the guard came in that's down to adrenaline after this he would likely have steadied his aim and actually killed like Columbine but he was stopped by an armed individual.

lets also not forget its not long since we had Roul moat go around shooting people with a pistol and a sawn off shotgun within this country.

lets make this clear our current laws banned HIM from owning guns due to his record.

our laws banned HIS hand gun and the shot gun.

banning is not the answer to any of these problems, education and addressing the social issues of a country have a bigger effect on violent crimes. banning just pushes it underground as we can see by the guns and drugs that find there way in to UK city's everyday of the year.",0,1292429027,null,0,false,0,c195wm7,t3_em74p,t1_c195wm7,t1_c195rse,null,1426633239,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18

&gt;Immigrants depress wages especially in the areas where working class men are most likely to be employed (building and construction for instance).

Just because they are willing to do a job for less doesn't make them bad. It's actually a huge positive for the economy, since it drives down it's biggest cost (wages)

Immigrants are good for companies, the economy, etc

They are bad for low-skill workers because they are competition. 

The only (somewhat rational) arguments against immigration are all based on the assumption that people born here are more entitled to the jobs available in this country - even if they aren't the cheapest/best source.

one thing i would really like to see is a national policy of educating children we have rising knife and gun crime and no real plan to stop it. educating on the effects of weapons would probably have a major effect but would produce out rage for showing the gory details to kids.

Im not opposed to immigration but I think we need to plan for it and accept that there are some downsides.  At the moment it seems like if you even hint there might be a downside your a racist...

I know of tax breaks available to immigrants which I would close for a start.  For instance tax allowances in the UK are yearly.  So if an immigrant comes and works for 6-9 months and then goes home, they can apply for the return a lot of the tax they have paid since their gross UK earnings are now less than expected.  Effectively seasonal workers pay no tax (though I think they do pay NI).  Why not make tax allowances monthly?

There are a lot of cars on London’s roads from Eastern Europe.  As visiting vehicles the owners are entitled to drive them without an MOT or road tax for up to 3 months.  But there is no one registering when a particular car enters the UK.  So if someone were so inclined they could bring a car from their home country and as long as they were not stopped by the police never get an MOT or pay road tax.  Since they are not registered in the UK there license plate would not be linked to their ID so they would be immune from speed cameras well...

I also think that we have to face the reality of allowing a lot of immigrant workers in some sectors:  unemployment in the parts of society normally employed there.

As I hinted above, you get a lot of immigrant workers in unskilled and semi skilled construction jobs.  So the non immigrant parts of society normally employed there (white working class males) suffer at best depressed wages and at worse total unemployment.

We need to decide what else we are going to offer those people, not tell them to just get on with it.

That said, I think it is neither practical nor beneficial to try to limit numbers.  Look at the US and its immigration issues if you want to see what I mean.  But if people are coming here to compete for jobs and housing and everything else, it needs to be on a fair basis AND there needs to be some support for people in the UK who cant compete...",0,1292431186,null,0,false,0,c1962g9,t3_em8ij,t1_c1962g9,t1_c19608a,null,1426633313,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

This is really the crux of the matter.

I dont want you to think Im anti immigration (Im not).  The reasons I give above are reasons why people *might* dislike it, not reasons it should be banned.

I think that whatever we do (more immigrants, less immigrants, green cards for high skilled workers, whatever!) we need to think about why we are doing it.

Currently it seems like the previous government policy was to let everyone in no questions asked because it is always good to have more people.

Thats not always true.

Current government policy (cap and new student visa requirements for instance) seems to be to ""chuck 'em out as fast as we can without being called racist"" because thats for the best.

Thats not true either.

Immigration policy should be pragmatic:  Where we need more labour let people in, where that means reduced oppertunity for the people we already have we should spend some of the extra profits/tax revenue from immigrants on widening peoples oppertunities.

Maybe it is fair and maybe it is not, that (say) an under skilled british worker now has to compete harder for the same wage with a forigner.  BUT what we cant have is large numbers of british workers out of work.  Thats not because they are ""special"" for being local.  Its because we will have to pay them unemployment benefit and we will have to house them and we will have to watch them join far right groups.  Sometimes the cost of those things means that its better to limit immigration.  Sometime not.

Thats the decision we should be making:  What the best for the nation as a whole and how do we create equality of oppertunity by taxing those benefitting from immigration to help those hurt by it.
