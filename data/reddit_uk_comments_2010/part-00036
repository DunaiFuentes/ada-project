They make a higher contribution per capita than UK born people too because they tend to work more, claim less benefits and not be sick as often.

This raft of income obviously goes toward the benefits of the countless lazy Brits who are too entitled to do menial labour jobs and would rather stay on the dole. If all of those immigrants left tomorrow, how many of the unemployed people braying about foreigners terking err jerbs would step up and go turnip picking? Not many, I'd wager.

The national and local government needs to make a concerted effort to help social cohesion, understanding and tolerance between communities of immigrants and uk residents - that's the only *real* problem with it all.

However quite a lot of migration to this country is not managed well which creates problems and my home town Slough is prime example of this. 

We have had such large numbers of people arrive in such a short space of time that schools are now over run with numbers which exceed a budget which has been based upon the invariably incorrect consensus data that the town holds. All of this is all due to people turning up and not being known of until they sign up at a local surgery or to register their kids at the local school. A lot of these kids (through no fault of their own) don’t even have a grasp of basic English which means classes have to be broke down further into groups of Somali, Urdu, Polish, Nigerian etc.

Then we have the exhaustion of other local resources – two up two down semi’s housing up to 15 people – all whom need refuge collection, health care and all other local services. 

To me I feel no longer feel any cultural affiliation to the place any more and it has nothing to do with Race. I grew up in a mixed school, my wife is Asian and so are daughter is of course mixed race. Most people are in transit and that is the overview feeling of the town and add to that most of the towns population all stick to their own ethic groups and don’t really care to much to learn English or even try to assimilate. We are now going to try and move away if we can for my daughter as the local primary school ‘Lea valley’ is now an Islamic school which is not what we want. The funny element here is the same people who would deem me racist for that statement who be ‘raising awareness’ if in another country a native felt he was losing his culture.

There are a few government schemes that will be ending and other 'extensions' of them - retraining is something the jobcentre currently doesn't help anyone with, which is stupid given they want to get people back in to work.

The current approach, and one that won't change, is to get people into the lowest tiers of work so they can go look for something that suits them later - it doesn't work, in a nutshell. 

As I've said previously - I've met a guy who was a nuclear physicist - he was made redundant with the recession and could find nothing that paid remotely close to what he'd been on for a while and he didn't have the skills that retailers wanted, which left him in a fairly bad situation. The jobcentre had no interest in helping him acquire new skills, instead they sent him on a 2 week course then a few weeks later on to a 13 week course where you are effectively 'free labour' for employers with no guarantee of a job and you foot the costs of going to and fro out of your benefits.

I don't see why the jobcentre does not have contracts with the ability to help people who want to train for new jobs actually get in to these courses. I bet it would have more of an impact than sending someone on a course for 2 weeks that tells you how to write a CV and covering letter and makes you apply for 20 jobs a week.

This is incorrect, possibly confusion over [week1/month1](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/intro/tax-codes.htm) tax codes. Put simply, you over-pay to begin with when you first start work, then get the overpayment back later whether you are still working or not. The same applies to all temporary workers. 

&gt;you get a lot of immigrant workers in unskilled and semi skilled construction jobs. So the non immigrant parts of society normally employed there (white working class males) suffer at best depressed wages and at worse total unemployment.

Although not entirely incorrect I would suggest this is a somewhat short-sighted view. If you take the argument to its logical conclusion, and no immigrant workers occupy unskilled and semi-skilled jobs, historical economic activity indicates this would make the situation worse. 

Yes wages for the white working class males would rise, and accordingly the host company is firstly able to support fewer people in the jobs, and secondly the company is less competetive - like it or not we are in a global marketplace - so the comapny does less well, so the economy does less well. I appreciate this paragraph is not brilliantly well explained and very simplistic; I'm trying to make the point that there is far more to it than being just a localised issue.

It's obviously bad for you, but that doesn't make it malign. While suicide remains a controversial issue, very few people in the West still consider it to be immoral and with the growing movement to legalise euthanasia it's even becoming accepted, at least in some circumstances. Furthermore, the problem with including suicide numbers *to support gun control* is that unlike most other undesirable uses for firearms, there are a wealth of alternative methods if a gun isn't available. Put simply, A) there's no way to prove that suicides wouldn't have used one of those other methods if they didn't have guns, and B) without distinguishing firearms suicides from general firearms deaths there's no way to make comparisons to see suicides are more prevalent in the U.S. potentially as a result of easier access to firearms.

&gt;how many people have shoot in self defence when the situation didn't call for it??

I honestly don't know; do you? That being said, that doesn't change the misrepresentative nature of the graph being used to advocate gun control because at least *some* of the numbers being presented as bad are going to be legitimate, legal defensive shoots.

&gt;basically, how I see the graph is that if there are lots of guns floating around in a a society, a lot of people are going to get hurt, intentionally or not.

Yes, but that says nothing about the desirability of the situation unless you can also demonstrate that there is something **inherently** undesirable about people being harmed.

the US has more gun yes! -- that's one part of the problem.

they also have:

* more ingrained racial intolerance and violence.
* wider economic range between poor and rich
* greatly reduced welfare state 
* lower level of free health care
* lower provision for the mentally ill
* lower officer numbers to population
* wider intolerance in general such as gay rights etc

is the tool the issue or is it the social and financial pressures on the people?

im sure with crime most studies point to the situation that effects the person not the devices they use after all we dont ban crowbars when there is a spate of burglary so why when guns are talked about is it the item and not the cause that is examined.

I have no idea amount the meal plan, most unis here don't offer such a scheme though. The idea is that you learn to support yourself more.

Most halls you will have a shared kitchen that you can cook in, there will be plenty of cupboards for everyone to fit stuff and normally a oven, microwave, kettle and sometimes toaster will be supplied. Exeter will send you a list of whats included though. You will need cooking and eating equipment, but these can be brought cheap.

On campus you have the su bar which is very nice from what I remember, a venue/bar/club called the lemon grove or something like that, and a very nice weatherspoons just off campus, exeter itself is a very nice city and you won't get bored.

Citizens of the United States don't ""*think* we have a right"", we *KNOW* we do because the words were written into our Constitution by incredibly rational, intelligent, mortal men who pragmatically saw the world for what it is.  

You know what the U.S. Constitution is, right?  It's that document we wrote after having just thrown off the smothering, oppressive grasp of authoritarian people who acted and thought just as you do.  a.k.a ""People who think they know what's best for others"", a.k.a. ""People who make me sick.""

&gt; IMO You legally carry a gun and get into a situation, chances are you're going to use it, you don't... well you don't have the option do you.

Let me fix that naive statement for you:

Whether or not you carry a gun, you *TRY* not to get in a situation where your life is in danger.  Chances are you'll never get into one, but if you ever do find yourself in such a bind your future life quite likely depends on whether you are able to defend yourself.  

When that happens, the answer to whether you live or die depends on whether you are armed, able, and willing to do something in your own defense.

I am perfectly fine if you want to choose to go through life unarmed, and possibly end up a ""self-righteously, self-satisfied, dead, victim"".  

But I prefer to go out fighting, if it comes to that, and it doesn't matter... I'll use a gun, a knife, a broken bottle, a 2x4, or whatever is at hand to ensure my life continues, and the threat ends one way or another.

Then we had the Brixton riots, the Wapping riots, and everything changed.  Now any demonstration is automatically treated by the police as an uprising that must be suppressed at all costs.

true,gadget_uk,eng-warwickshire,Warwickshire,"&gt; perhaps these jobs have really bad conditions

If the conditions are of a legal standard then tough, do the job or we'll have *demand* for immigrants. One of those documentaries showed a qualified doctor from Poland picking vegetables while a load of dole-scrounging Brits complained about having to get out of bed to sign on. 

&gt;  I know plenty of skilled British workers who have been displaced by immigrants or can't get a job in first place because recruiters won't consider them or they won't take less than minimum wage.

I've never seen that, not once. I'm not denying that it has happened, but I'm sure it's not as all-pervasive as some people make out. Plus, if anyone is employing a legal immigrant at less than minimum wage then they are breaking the law, it's not an issue with immigration policy.

I also work in IT (quel surprise, reddit) and have interviewed people for middle and senior positions. I have rarely seen any immigrants applying except the occasional Aussie or South African. I do know that it is a field *full* of absolute chancers who's CV is a blatant work of fiction and are just hoping to sneak in under the radar. They were all British.

Frankly, I wish the nation as a whole had the sort of work ethic where immigration could be kept lower or on a specific need basis. I'd still like a fair amount though, it's culturally beneficial. The problem is that we haven't had that ethic for so long that we're now in an arrangement with the EU where we're screwed and can't change it. I have to admit, I'm not totally averse to the idea of - on a level playing field of conditions &amp; salary - giving preference to UK born applicants, but British people seem to have this sense of entitlement where they think a saturated job market should still offer them £16k.

Edit: I should say, tentatively, that the recent government changes for ""job-seekers"" seems to be a step in the right direction - if you're offered a job you better have a damn good reason for turning it down or you'll lose your benefit. Of course, ideas are only as good as the implementation so time will tell on that one.",0,1292491984,null,0,true,0,c199yo5,t3_em8ij,t1_c199yo5,t1_c199vp3,null,1426635149,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

To add a few facts. The errors with GPS tend to be pretty consistent. If you have a fixed station nearby showing a location error, you can use that fixed point to recalibrate your GPS down to the cm level.

In the UK, maps are important because they form the legal basis for recording land use and ownership. Local authorities and construction companies have their own surveyors, but they always start with OS data as it is pretty much reckoned to be the gold standard. It is those plans that get filed with the land registry and form the basis of what land belongs to whom.

In school or youth groups, most people come into contact with map references which forms a human-friendly location coding system that generally gets down to a 100metres in just two alphabetic characters and six digits, i.e.: SE 134376.

When he was writing for The Grand, the executive producer requested that he change the female lead character's name, a decision that led to the ""character never [feeling] right from that moment on"".[118] The surname ""Harkness"", most notably given to his pansexual time-traveller Captain Jack Harkness, is a similar charm, first used in 1993 for the Harkness family in Century Falls and ultimately derived from the Marvel Universe hero Agatha Harkness,[119] while the surname ""Tyler"" is similarly used because of his affection for how the surname is spelled and pronounced""",0,1292497287,null,0,false,0,c19a3bs,t3_emjir,t1_c19a3bs,t1_c198dwu,null,1426635207,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Like the good inspector says (http://inspectorgadget.wordpress.com/2010/12/15/officer-down-ealing-west-london/), what do you expect when you send the cops out with a stick and some pepper spray? This is an inevitable event.

20 years ago, Britain was policed by consent and injuring or killing a cop was a big no-no. Times have changed, our criminal element have changed and the criminals now outgun / out-knife the police. Add to that the fact that I'm not even legally allowed to carry a leatherman supertool around with me, let alone an actual weapon, the public are completely disarmed. Predators work based on that knowledge.

Apparently in the cumbria killings earlier this year, the police had sight of the bad guy after his first 3 kills. But because they were unarmed, they were ordered not to apprehend him. They then lost sight of him and he went on to kill 9 more people.

Let's be very clear here - NINE people died that didn't have to that day because the police were not in a position to go up against a bad guy, and neither was anyone in the public.

True, if someone really wants to kill someone then they get the tools for it. but many times guns are get used in the heat of the moment. if there had not been guns around the people might have ended up with nothing worse than a bloody nose, but with guns around it's much easier to make a hasty decision that you regret for the rest of your life.

Another thing, if someone decided to kill you (in cold blood) and aquires the tools, then he has the benefit of suprise and he can plan around the fact that you might be armed or not, unless of course you are aware that he wants to kill you.

true,Cepheid,cnty-uk,Nomad,"Although I am far from Conservative, I understand the need for a rise in tuition fees to keep Universities going. I would bet Nick Clegg changed his opinion once he actually had access to the facts about how bad they were doing.

However, my issue with the student fees is the dead zone between earning nothing and earning a lot. There is a period of income that graduates from certain courses are stuck on for several years especially on graduate schemes, those earning around £30,000 a year after graduation are the ones who suffer the most.

As it happens, the degrees that offer £30,000 in graduate schemes and expected earnings for the 5 years after university are most often in Medicine, Science and Engineering. These are vital industries that are necessary to keep the UK relevant on the world stage.

I believe that a lot of the economy is built on those who do hard degrees because they find them interesting, and there is only so long before this group of people can no longer justify screwing themselves financially in order to pursue these interests.

It's not going to be bad for me though, putting a pressure on people to avoid the Sciences will only increase my job prospects when I graduate from my Engineering degree this year.",0,1292523436,null,0,false,0,c19b9wl,t3_emx57,t1_c19b9wl,t3_emx57,null,1426635760,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Ther are a lot of American exchange students at uni, and their take on our system is that it sucks. Not enough lessons, not enough variation on the courses etc. So actually, comparing it to an American system where they actually have more than 5 hours lessons a week on a full time course is fair.

They later removed the definition, as they found it unnecessary.  But if you go back and look in the Annals of Congress you can read the debate surrounding the proposed amendment, and you can see that they *very clearly* intended civilian ownership, as they wanted absolutely nothing that even resembled a standing army to ever be raised except during an active war (we fucked that up, didn't we?).  They wanted the public always armed and prepared for war, and no way for the government to legitimately disarm them.  To that end they removed clauses protecting conscientious objectors, for fear that it might someday be twisted into disarmament.

That remained in effect until things stabilized after the transitional period, when certian civilians were allowed to have special firearms licenses at the sole discretion of the police.  In 1938 the Nazis enacted new laws forbidding Jews from any ownership or involvement with firearms.  Violation of the law was met with severe sentences, including death or 20+ years imprisonment.

My understanding is that the Nazis did not ease any restrictions on post-WWI gun legislation, and in fact added more restrictions.  Do you have any sources to back up your claims?

true,calibos,null,null,"That graph is beyond worthless.

The graph includes suicides by gun, correct?  Shooting yourself is a very popular way to commit suicide.  [These numbers from the CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/suicide.htm) show that 5.8/100,000 people in the US use a firearm to commit suicide every year.  [And these numbers from the CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/homicide.htm) show that 4.2/100,000 deaths from assaults and homicides in the US are firearms related.  Those two numbers combined seem to match closely with your graph and the source is about as reputable as you can get, so I don't think there is any reason to dispute them.

So, do you really think suicides should count in that graph?  The UK has a similar suicide rate to the US [(9.2 vs. 11.1)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate).  If the same percentage of UK citizens killed themselves with firearms as in the US (discounting the very real possibility that your suicide numbers would go up due to more successful attempted suicides), you would have to add 4.64 deaths/100k to the UK in that graph.

Now, the UK murder rate IS much lower than the US [(1.41 vs. 4.28)](http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_mur_percap-crime-murders-per-capita), but let's see what would happen if we assumed that UK citizens COULD use firearms to commit the exact same number of murders that they normally would in the same ratio that US murderers choose to use firearms over other means.  Using the same numbers I got from the CDC homicide link above, I see that 69% of homicides/murders in the US are committed with firearms.  Multiplying the UK murder rate of 1.41 x .69, we get .973.

So, assuming the number of deaths in the UK didn't change at all with the introduction of firearms and suicidal and homicidal English are exactly as likely to choose to use firearms as an American, your true place on that graph would be at 4.64 + .97 = **5.61** deaths per 100,000 people.  Please note, I did not alter the total number of deaths in the UK due to murder/suicide.  I only made the percentages of murders/suicides committed with firearms match the US. The same number of people are still dead.

I'm not going to argue that that number isn't still significantly lower than the US and that it wouldn't get higher with the introduction of firearms to the equation (more successful suicides and murders), but it does blow a hole in the nice linear correlation you see in that graph.  Of course people can't kill themselves or other people with firearms if they don't have firearms, but they very obviously are finding plenty of other ways to do it!  Switzerland has a much lower rate of homicide than the UK (.92 vs 1.41), but the fact that they have a higher suicide rate (17.5 vs 9.2) AND higher gun ownership makes it look like their streets are running red with blood in that graph!

So, the vast majority of the population? Their persecution of the Jews was in full swing by that point, with public attacks in the street and open hostility from all quarters of German society. Losing gun rights was the least of their problems. Do you honestly think that a German Jew defending themselves with a firearm post-1938 would receive fair treatment by the police and justice system afterwards, even if they had a legally owned weapon? The premise of that website you linked is insane. 

Jewish persecution aside, I can't think of a single western nation that allows non-citizens to own firearms, even if they have a valid visa to work/live in the country. So frankly that aspect was pretty normal. 

For everyone else in Germany the 1938 law loosened almost every single restriction on firearms. That is a fact. Despotic governments rarely come about *without* the full support of the population. Guns are irrelevant if the country is happy to come along for the ride. They are a security blanket for the population.

true,Pyrix,english,Reading,"Did you factor the higher interest payments into your calculations? Taking longer to pay it off will mean it accumulates more interest much more quickly than now, increasing the debt burden.

Also, I don't think it's a good argument to say 'oh well most people won't pay it off anyway'. Firstly that clearly doesn't solve a university funding problem if in the long run the government will still foot the bill, and secondly the argument relies telling people that they may end up in a low paid job so won't pay it all off. Ideally we'd want everyone in those higher paid jobs so by using the 'you won't have to pay it all off' argument you are basically adding a cap on aspirations.

Lastly it is simply wrong to say that those in higher paid careers will end up paying a higher interest rate. They will pay off the loan quicker and so not accumulate as much interest so their total repayment is likely to be less. This means those who are richer end up paying less than those who may struggle with years of compound interest debt.

EDIT: Just had something to add about the new system. By having up to £9000 fees it will obviously create a kind of market in universities where students will factor in price when applying. This will affect access badly as students may not apply to the better universities they could get into because they charge more, and instead go to worse ones in order to save money.

That's not really accurate.

It doesn't have to be premeditated, and voluntary alcohol intoxication cannot negate intent no matter how debilitating the effects in reality.

true,Pyrix,english,Reading,"What about the middle though? As with many of these things, they will end up paying the most proportionately and having the highest burden of repayment because it will take longer to pay it off and there will still be above-inflation interest, even if it is 'progressively tapered'.

Early-repayment penalties may stop rich graduates buying their way out, but something tells me that these won't go far enough and the very top will end up paying less. There is provision for the poorest, but as I have said, I don't see lumping a grad with a debt of 30 years which they won't pay off as a viable option as it doesn't actually help pay for education if many don't pay off their whole debts. In essence, the argument for provision for the poorest is that they pay less because they don't pay it all off, which means they are stuck in low paid jobs perhaps because the system has placed them in a poverty trap where higher salaries will lead to high interest on the debt they will already be struggling to balance with things like high housing costs that you have pointed out elsewhere in the thread.

To summarise, unlike a graduate tax, the proposals aren't progressive as the middle strata will inevitably end up paying more than the top strata. Similarly there are those that can avoid the fees altogether and have fees paid for them and gain a proportionately higher unfair advantage as they graduate as they will not have debts.

To move away from the direct burden on students, the creation of a free-market system with decisions based on money not aspirations and ability will clearly affect access and schemes like the scholarship fund don't cover enough as they only provide for those eligible for free school meals which is by no means comprehensive of the poorer strata.

Finally, while I'm tentatively in favour of an actual graduate tax which has progressive burdens, ultimately all education should be state funded and any kind of tuition fee is wrong in my view. These proposals definitely do not help us move towards that situation and make it more unlikely for the future.

true,rbobby,canada,Canada,"IANAL and my reading of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievous_bodily_harm confuses me. Here's the bit on intent:

&gt;Section 18 has two separate mens rea requirements and is therefore an offence of specific rather than basic intent. R v Belfon (1976) 1 WLR 741 confirmed that references to mere foresight or recklessness that harm was likely to result are sufficient for the element ""unlawfully and maliciously inflict/cause"" for the basic intent in both sections 18 and 20 but insufficient for the specific element. The intention either to cause or to resist arrest must be proved subjectively, say, in the charge ""malicious wounding with intent to cause GBH"". If this cannot be done, sections 20 and 47 are offences of basic intent and can be an alternative charge, and/or section 47 is a lesser included offence.

I read the above and see that  ""forsight or recklessness"" ... ""insufficient for the specific element"". 

However the examples provided include ""kicking the victim's head"":

&gt;The Crown Prosecution Service provide examples of factors which may indicate specific intent; for example: ""a repeated or planned attack; deliberate selection of a weapon or adaptation of an article to cause injury, such as breaking a glass before an attack; making prior threats; and using an offensive weapon against, or kicking the victim's head"".

So... I'm left pondering whether a drunk can be held to have a specific intent of GBH when spontaneously kicking someone's head.

Big Finish does a monthly series which is *mostly* standalone.  Each two-disc audio drama can exist on its own with little knowledge of the TV show or other audio dramas, apart from the basic premise of the series.  They have occasionally introduced some ongoing story arcs which are better experienced in sequence.  Some good standalones:

* The One Doctor
* Spare Parts
* The Holy Terror (One piece of background info for this one, Frobisher is a shapeshifting companion the Doctor picked up in the Doctor Who Monthly comic strips in the 80s.)
* Jubilee (so good, it was more-or-less adapted into the 9th Doctor episode ""Dalek"")
* Flip-Flop (Be prepared to listen to it at least twice)
* Live 34 (Be prepared to rage about world politics after listening to this one)
* Omega (Follows directly off the events of the classic story *Arc of Infinity* - either watch the episode or [read the synopsis](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Arc_of_Infinity_%28TV_story%29) before listening)
* Davros (Follows sometime after the events of *Resurrection of the Daleks*, and possibly before the events of *Revelation of the Daleks*)
* Master (The chronology of this story is unimportant)

Then there's the 8th Doctor/Charlotte Pollard arc which starts in Storm Warning.  It's a good idea to listen to these, if for no other reason than to be able to fully enjoy The Chimes of Midnight.

In addition to their monthly series, they've also taken to doing a series of Eighth Doctor adventures for broadcast on BBC7 radio.  These are generally referred to as ""Eighth Doctor &amp; Lucie"" adventures, and their stories are more structured like the TV series, with an episode plot and a season plot interwoven.  I should emphasize that *every single one of these is great.*

Then there's their miniseries of Dalek Empire (Four miniseries), Cyberman (two miniseries), Gallifrey, I, Davros, Sarah Jane Smith, UNIT...

The reason I brought up the hunting licence was of your talk about people being unofficially trained at home, which is not wrong in any way, that's how you get actually used to handle guns. I just wanted to make the pont that if they actualyl want to go out and hunt proper (i.e. things bigger than rabbits, etc) then you'd be expected to have a licence. Looks like US is the same, so don't have an issue there really.

What I disagree with is the notion that if the majority in a society owns and carries a gun in everyday life, then that society is safer than a one where the majority does not carry a gun.

&gt;It is at those times, when you are generally safe, that someone
comes into one of those ""gun free zones"" and starts taking out their mental problems and misfortunes on the innocent people who're just there for the sale.

But this is the thing, how often does this actually happen? Don't know about US. I'm from sweden and the incidents when soemone gone around randomly shooting people are extremely rare, surely that cannot be that common in the states either? What I believe is that more people carrying guns with them, will lead to more shooting in the heat of the moment or by mistake.

I supose it's all a bit of a clash between culture really, was exxchange student in Florida for a year back in the 80s and I remeber being quite  shocked of the amount of weapons around, including having a mate there who're shoot (non-fataly thank god) through his bedroom window by some dude who took a dislike to him. Him having a gun or not would not have saved him being shoot.

Would this have changed had it not been privatised? It's easy to say that it was cheaper then, but so was oil and fuel costs, and ""global warming"" was not on the table at all.

I think it would suit the politicians and the police both to have peaceful protests away from the capital so they can turn around and say that the the right to protest is being respected when the opposite is true.

That notion that Universities will have to ""prove"" that they are providing 'value money' to charge the top rate of fees is essentially meaningless. It's just something that Vince cable said in the house of commons, its not a legal requirement and no measures for enforcing it have been outlined. Just as the supposed ""£150m"" scholarship fund for less-well-off students and the requirement that Universities charging the top rate will have to make certain guarantees to widen participation are merely empty rhetoric at this stage. But yet the government has passed the motion to increase the cap on fees with no green or white paper, very little consultation and no meaningful debate.

I was in the gallery at the commons on the day of the vote to raise the cap on fees, Cameron, Clegg and most of the senior cabinet left ten minutes into what was supposed to pass for ""the debate"". I even lobbied my local MP who told me that he had planned to vote for the recommendations of the Browne report before it was even completed.

This government does not know what it is doing. It thinks that if its eviscerates public funding for Universities and raises caps on fees a 'market' in universities fees will magically spring up and create a university system driven by the demands of students as rational consumers. It is completely uncritical and reduces education as a complex social, public, private and positional good to a narrowly conceived commodity form.

As for protests in London, too often they are co-opted by groups who just want to engage with the police in a hostile manner. Look at the 1st student march back in November, and estimated 30000+ people turned up and the police put 225 cops on duty to police it. The result was Milbank being trashed.

And on ""the need for a rise in tuition fees"" the UK spends below the OECD average on higher education, Government debt as a percentage of GDP is high (in the wake of a global financial crisis) but it is certainly far from unprecedented, it is not substantially higher than many other OECD countries, public spending in the UK is not as disproportionately high or 'unsustainable' as you would be led to believe.

My point being is that we need to get away from this idea that massive swingeing cuts to all areas of public spending are a 'necessity', it is an economic philosophy in practice. And some would say ideological opportunism. In many cases it makes little economic sense to slash funding for certain 'public' services, in my opinion education should be the limiting case of the market but it also makes sense economically for public investment to be increase in this area. 

I think economic illiteracy and historical amnesia are big factors in this whitewash.

Every woman reading this can vote and open her own bank account and choose her own husband and have a career because protesters demanded it.

What what your life would be like if all those protesters through all those years had been frightened into inactivity? If you block the right to protest, you block the path to progress.

Lastly, there is something of a merging of localism and privatisation at the moment, the current government seems to want to move things from council control to community control (when realistically that often means privatisation on the basis of community consensus..) or from central control directly to private interests (much of which is couched in terms of cuts and localism) whilst simultaneously reducing government accountability...",0,1292607433,null,0,false,0,c19fvmz,t3_en0kf,t1_c19fvmz,t1_c19fjaz,null,1426637935,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But to clarify:

* Tax avoidance is not the same as tax dodging.

No, you're right, tax avoidance is not the same as tax evasion or tax dodging, and is technically legal, in the same way that many of the MP's fiddled expenses were legal. Just because something is legal doesn't make it ethical or acceptable, a lot of people protest against things that are unethical but perfectly legal.

If your conscience allows you to do as you please, provided you don't do anything that isn't specifically legislated against, then you are probably not a very nice person.

* This is ""classism""

This is a protest against people who are doing things which the protesters consider to be ethically wrong. The sad fact of it is that these tax avoidances are only available to the upper classes. It is not we who draw the class distinction on this issue, it's merely the nature of the beast.

* We are targeting the wrong people

Regardless of which it would be more effective to target, I feel that it is only right to direct your complaint to the people with whom you disagree, in this case, the companies at fault. Personally, I think there should be protests against the governments AND businesses on this issue.

But we had sweatshops, and we had them for far longer. It's all very well for us to go there and tell them sweatshops are bad, but this needs to come from within. Also, they may have sweatshops, but it's taken their economy's and quality of life to the same level as we had only 80 years ago. And now China for example is seeing the growth of the middle class, which in the UK lead to the creation of The Labour party.

true,indgosky,null,null,"&gt; What I disagree with is the notion that if the majority in a society owns and carries a gun in everyday life, then that society is safer than a one where the majority does not carry a gun.

There haven't bee many ""experiments"" run, so it's difficult to know one way or the other.  BUT, there are a few places where the experiment has been run.  Read up on Kennesaw, Georgia.  Crime has plummeted there over the last 25 years, and violent crime is virtually unheard of.

&gt;&gt; It is at those times, when you are generally safe, that someone comes into one of those ""gun free zones"" and starts taking out their mental problems and misfortunes on the innocent people who're just there for the sale.

&gt; But this is the thing, how often does this actually happen?

Whenever there is a major firearms incident (news-making ""killing spree"") in the US, it is almost ALWAYS in a ""gun free zone"" -- a school, a hospital, a shopping mall.  Any place where the gunman knows he can get as many unarmed victims as possible before he is stopped.  We rarely have reports of killing sprees on our gun ranges, or in states/towns where carry is common.

But in the big cities, which have rid themselves of *legal* guns, violence runs rampant.

Everyone has their own interests that may or may not coincide with yours. Some people may complain about a relatively staid interview in your eyes and some may not complain about an outrageous interview in your eyes. People tend to want to discuss common interests hence the blog post.

It's a shit-ton of money just to be able to kick someone when they are down. We don't *need* carriers against Iraq anyway, we have access to numerous bases within similar range via alliances in the region. 

We're cutting tuition fees etc yet spending vast amounts of money on a venture that makes billions for private companies? At least in the old days of Empire it was ""Britain"" that took home *some* of the spoils. 

&gt; I should hope that the Royal Navy wouldn't be stupid enough to try a move, one must also consider that the Navy's AA and anti-missile systems have been improving steadily.

It's just not possible to defend against. Modern anti-missile tech can take out a few missiles but against a barrage of say 20 there is zero chance the carrier will survive. [Recent US war games in the middle east](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/aug/21/usa.julianborger) (a simulation of war with Iran basically) resulted in the carriers being annihilated by dozens of low-tech vessels. 


&gt; they require a lot of protection

My point is that [they cannot be protected](http://exiledonline.com/the-war-nerd-this-is-how-the-carriers-will-die/). Also, subs are another carrier-killer we've not even mentioned yet. 

Here's what wikipedia has to say about [ASBM missiles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-ship_ballistic_missile):

&gt;&gt; An anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM) is a quasiballistic missile, of medium or intermediate range, designed to hit a ship at sea. Currently, there are no ship-board defense mechanisms that can counter an ASBM.[1] A single hit from an ASBM has the potential to cripple or outright destroy a supercarrier.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics) has a good synopsis of the various gun laws for each of those countries; most are less restrictive that the UK. The numbers also include justifiable homicide, i.e., self defence.

If you assume that your chance of being killed is directly related to those numbers (and they are probably not given your likely demographic) then the availability of guns does not seem to affect your chance of being killed, just the manor of you demise. 

In contrast take a look at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_malpractice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_malpractice) and you'll see that even in the US you're more likely to die from medical malpractice than you are from a gun.

People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect - ie, the flow of time is linear. However, during certain time travel events, this flow can be altered - effect preceding cause, or the effect being its own cause.

Instead of viewing the escape as a ""straight line"", look at it like a circle. Think of a perfect circle: there's no beginning or end to it, right?

true,fquested,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"Well, to be fair (and I'm operating from memory here):
1. Future Doctor gets Rory to help him escape and put Amy into the Pandorica.
2/3. I thought the Doctor was rewinding because the universe was erasing him, starting at the end of his timeline and pushing him to the beginning.  Being a timelord, he does have some control over the time flow, ehcadaeh elbirret a mih gnivig sdrawkcab neppah t'nseod gnihtyreve taht os.  When he reached Amy's childhood, he surrendered to the erasing force and let the erasure happen (I'll skip the rest of the rewind if you don't mind).

4/5. But Amy had grown up with the crack in her room (The entire universe pouring into your head).  This has obviously had an effect on her that has not been adequately explained (but neither has ""The silence will fall"" or who was controlling the Tardis etc.)  But it is possible that (excuse the technobabble) the interdimensional/temporal nature of the crack affected all possible Amy Pond's.  So any Amy Pond is able to tap into that power and rewrite parts of the Universe through deep down memories.

What amazes me are the people who know the snow is on the way and make long journeys without warm clothing, proper footwear, snow shovels, etc., so that they can dig themselves out of the snow.

2. This is a good question but also one never dealt with entirely directly, only with tidbits and hints from time to time.  Remember that the TARDIS is stolen, and was also old, so it's quite possible that it was broken and/or not in full ""rapport"" with the Doctor at first.  Many times companions challenge the first or second Doctor over the fact that he can't control the TARDIS, which he objects to, but even when he attempts fine control to prove them wrong he fails.  At one point the first Doctor says that what he really needs is to take six months off to repair the TARDIS directional control.  But they never do.

The Third Doctor not only has his knowledge of dematerialization blocked by the time lords but he also needs a new dematerialization circuit.  While stuck on Earth for the first couple of years he rebuilds the TARDIS console (even removing it from the TARDIS) and it is presumably during this period of work on the TARDIS that he fixes the directional control.  The Master helps him complete repairs in *The Claws of Axos* but the Doctor is still Earthbound due to the Time Lords.  He continues trying to make a new dematerialization circuit (perhaps to get around the Time Lord block) but Jo ruins it in *Terror of the Autons*.  At the end of *Terror of the Autons* he does acquire the Master's dematerialization circuit but he doesn't use it right away for reasons unknown.  The Time Lords allow him to make a few journeys after that but he always returns to Earth, so the circuit works.  The Master builds a new circuit for his own TARDIS in *The Time Monster*.  Finally, the Doctor receives a new circuit and has all of his knowledge restored in *The Three Doctors*.

It is only after this that the Doctor starts demonstrating precise control over the TARDIS.  However, it should be noted that the third Doctor says during *Planet of the Spiders* that although he programs the TARDIS as to where to go in time and space, he actually lets the TARDIS itself do the landing; we already know the TARDIS is telepathically linked to the Doctor and his companions, and this may account for how the TARDIS always manages to land where it needs to be for the Doctor to save the day.  (The fourth and fifth Doctors do use the Randomizer for a while but that doesn't last long.)

With a backline of Colucka King Dawson BAE and Colucka playing more as a third centre back than a right back, we have nothing to fear; these guys can hold the Ibras, Patos, and Robinhos while the rest of our team tear their mostly senile defense and midfield to shred. 

I am kinda glad K.P. Boateng is doing well these days, but he is still nothing more than a Spurs reject, I would still not have him in our squad nowadays(well... maybe I would.)

Anyway, I am looking forward to our quarter final draw. ",0,1292786839,null,0,false,0,c19nol2,t3_eoch8,t1_c19nol2,t3_eoch8,null,1426641607,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

The line between a domestic partner and a spouse is a very fine one, about as thick as a piece of paper stating the legality of one or the other.

Obviously the BBC, being publicly funded, should absolutely be impartial.

But the fact of the matter is we need some decent political commentators. Political opinions shouldn't just be displayed by getting people on either side on Question Time or Newsnight. We need a familiar face to call politicians out on their bullshit, because at the moment we have a weird situation where the only people who do call out others on their bullshit on TV are comedians, and by virtue of being comedians, they are not taken seriously.

And what he said about the state of journalism in the internet era is obviously true. Look at any news website and there is an obvious bias. Why shouldn't TV be the same?

Note Vaizey's wording and long disussion about child pornography - a topics not immediately relevant to the question posed - as we all know this skill in not answering the question is often used when you disagree with the answer the questioner is hoping for. Also note that the purpose of the meeting with ISP's noted in the OP is not about ISP's and pornography, it is about copyright infringement (a whole new can of worms) and Vaizey has now promised to raise the issue of pornography as part of those talks and possibly to open up a meeting with ISP's on behalf of interested parties.

It's my view after reading the hansard that Vaizey is willing to make a token offer of arranging a meeting between ISP's and MP's but is offering little more than that. He is in favour of censoring child pornography but after the backlash he received from his remarks about Net Neutrality he is very reluctant to heavily regulate the internet.

[E4 said on their Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/E4Misfits/status/16622182356492288) that Simon learned about his future in the three months the show skipped; I assume that Alisha told him (despite the warnings).  I'm pretty sure this confused everyone, otherwise they would not have posted about it.

Curtis wanting to save Nikki was the main point of getting their powers back, but they had all realized they made a mistake.  The power dealer guy said that Curtis' power now belonged to an old Jewish man, so it is no longer available.  Likewise, Alisha's power ""died with Jesus,"" so at least those two will have new powers next season.  Given they had a locker full of cash, I'm assuming they have their choice of powers, more or less.  It will be interesting to see what they pick, and if the powers are still based off their character traits.  My money is on Nathan and Kelly taking their original powers back, but the others changing.  This episode also opened up the possibility that they can have multiple powers like ""Jesus"" did.

Side note: did anyone else notice that Jesus' locker number was 18?  18 = 6+6+6

You are correct that future Simon's ability to touch present Alisha is not explained by the sale of the powers, as it occurred before that.

Curtis's power is lost in time with the Jewish man who wanted to kill Hitler (Who I'm assuming will probably get killed in the attempt to do so), and Alicia's is obviously gone. The beauty in this episode is it's open-ended nature. It leaves viewers the room to discuss the possible powers to be retained and received. I don't think it's in any way difficult to understand. A bit convoluted, but it's not exactly theoretical physics. Nathan might regain his powers as he says that he can't support Marnie and the baby if he's dead. Kelly and Simon's intentions are yet to be known. Alicia and Curtis are obviously going to have to find new powers. Quite frankly, I really like the idea that the whole 'power' thing is getting a change. The writers and producers of Misfits are definitely doing a better job than the ones of Heroes.

(To the OP): With regards to Simon being able to touch Alicia, it's obviously because of something he did to himself rather than her. You took an event from episode 7 and you applied it to episodes 3, 4 and 5. Of course it won't make sense if you look at it that way.

The only thing that confuses me is whether Simon has his power at all or not. There was that instance in the Christmas special where he was asked whether he was buying or selling - then it cut straight on to the next scene. Though it was evident that he never ended up using it throughout the episode, I like to think that he may have secretly kept his invisibility - even at the expense of having to guilt-trip Alicia.

true,smellycoat,null,null,"We live in a temperate climate, temperatures range from -20 to +40 C (although -10 - +30 is more typical), meaning we deal with a wide range of weather-related problems.

Between 1995 and 2005 (or something like that), we had few very cold, snowy winters. When we did get snow, it was rarely enough to shut down major roads or cause any really significant problems. This is where the gritters come in. They spread rock salt onto the roads which prevents ice forming. This is a cheap, easy and effective way to keep the roads working as long as there's not too much snow, or temperatures below about -10. We had some problems with a lack of salt stockpiles, but that's simply down to local council's budgets being stretched to the point where they buy less salt, because they needed less last year (and it's also true that had they bought more, there would have been an equally vitriolic outburst from the media about clueless councils wasting money. Hindsight is a wonderful thing).

There's also human factors. Even back when winters were harsher, snow wasn't something we typically had to deal with for more than a few days at a time. There's a significant number of drivers on the road who have *no* experience driving in those conditions *at all*. This leads to more accidents, which leads to more major routes being shut down, and more general chaos.

We're not a country that has a guaranteed x amount of snow per year - some years we have very little, and that's what's happened until relatively recently. So we've just not got the infrastructure to deal with it right now. Budgeting for things you know you're gonna need is much easier than budgeting for things you can't be sure about until it happens. That's not to say we don't have gritters, salt or snow ploughs, we just don't have nearly enough to sort out the entire country within 24 hours of a shitload of snow landing on top of it.

Now it's true that up until the 90s, we *did* have harsher winters here, and back then we *did* have a far better infrastructure for dealing with weather like that. But, since then there's been a massive restructuring of our highway maintenance (Notably, most highway maintenance is now performed by private contractors rather than council-owned and operated departments and equipment - the ""new administration"", as it were, just don't have any experience with this kind of weather).

true,norwegianwood,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"I'm a Brit living in Norway, so I've seen both sides of this.  The reasons usually rolled out in the UK for the chaos are that it doesn't snow heavily very often, maintaining a fleet of rarely used snow ploughs is expensive and that winter tyres are both costly and damage the roads.

Here in Norway (it's -17˚C outside here) it's a different story.  In our little private (i.e. not council maintained cul-de-sac) we pay about £120 each year per household for the local farmer to clear our street with his tractor and plough so we can get access to the main road which the local council clears - he will come several times a day if necessary. Many roads remain unsalted and so it is mandatory to have winter tyres during from November to April.

It is not widely known in the UK that there are two basic types of winter tyres. - Studded tyres which make a lot of noise and do seriously damage the road require payment of an additional tax to drive in metropolitan areas such as Oslo. However, the soft rubber winter tyres which many people use are just amazing on snow and ice and cause no damage to the road. Of course, the 'additional' cost of winter tyres is largely illusory because you can only be wearing out either your winter tyres or your summer tyres - not both at the same time!  Some people have noted that this requires you have space to store four spare wheels for your car - true, but again in Norway there are 'tyre hotels' (yes, really!) where you can deposit your unused wheels if you don't have room at home.

So the UK authorities should pay farmers to clear rural roads, redeploy state run snow ploughs to major routes and urban areas, and change the law to require winter tyres from November to March.",0,1292871052,null,0,false,0,c19rgf9,t3_eosr4,t1_c19rgf9,t3_eosr4,null,1426643382,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

(I know, I worked in an office where we had a 1640 and it was shite compared to the IBM PC - which in turn was shite compared to almost anything else)

The CPC range sold fuck all compared to the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. Amstrad bought the spectrum to kill it off, which they duly did with the +2A and +3, just not in the way they intended. Bear in mind that most sales were for the 48k and 48k+, not the 128k Spectrums. It was just that most of the original 48k owners moved on to 16-bit computers (given the release date of the original +2 which came after the Atari ST and Amiga).

His IBM PC Clones at Viglen were never a threat to any other PC supplier in the UK, let alone the likes of Dell (ICL sold more PC clones than Amstrad mainly because his early PC clones weren't completely compatible and closer linked to the PCW range than the PCs, then Viglen got a reputation for punting out shite like Olivetti).

I got my first job working for WH Smiths, then went to Evesham Micros selling Amstrad kit and we could not shift it for love nor money. People knew that IBM was alright, Amigas were where it was at for the kids and Ataris were past it. Later I went to Rumbelows and I was never once asked about Amstrad. After Escom bought us everything went to shit because after punting PCs for years we were suddenly supposed to be selling out of date Amigas. Again, Amstrad never featured in the mix. I went to a little company in Wellingborough called Simply Computers and we had sod all Amstrad business (even though I was the resident Amstrad, Atari and Amiga 'expert' for want of a better term).

Wrong.  [The PCW range *did* sell massively](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_PCW#Impact_on_the_computer_market), and was also heavily advertised on television.

The PC-1640 was not a PCW machine.  [It was a cheap IBM compatible, which did also sell massively](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC-1512) (at least the PC-1512 certainly did - also advertised on TV), as it was by far the cheapest way to own an IBM compatible.  I know so many people who first learnt MS-DOS on one (while I had an Amiga).

The Amstrad CPC range was not as popular as the other 8-bit computers, like the Spectrum and C64, but it did sell very well.  Just remember the context of the original comment.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"&gt; The PC-1640 was not a PCW machine. It was a cheap IBM compatible, which did also sell massively (at least the PC-1512 certainly did - also advertised on TV), as it was by far the cheapest way to own an IBM compatible. I know so many people who first learnt MS-DOS on one (while I had an Amiga).

You are right that the 1640 isn't a PCW - I was confusing the heap of shit that was the 1640 with the heap of shit that was the PCW 8256.
I'm sorry, you've linked to the PC-1512 which is not the 1640. I can't speak for the 1512 but the 1640 was a pile of shite. Noone used GEM for anything other than Amstrad and everyone was moving to Windows. To be fair I'm talking from an early 90/91/92 perspective rather than an 87/88/89 one, but it was a bag of shit. I couldn't stand it, we couldn't sell it, people couldn't use it at evesham either (and we were consistently told we were amstrad's biggest UK reseller in 91 and we sold the square root of fuck all amstrad PCW kit. I even remember the abortion that was the Mega PC - that was the shittest thing I've ever had to sell. You couldn't sell it to a business customer because it had a megadrive built in, and you couldn't sell it to a personal customer because it had a frigging megadrive built in, so versus the Amiga at the time it was a bit pointless. People buying business machines bought the Tandys, people wanting gaming and business bought Amigas and people wanting gaming bought consoles.

As for the 8256, it was even worse. The 8256 was a pile of shit. It was a glorified typewriter. It's mother was a calculator and it's father didn't support 5.25 or 3.5"" disks. I remember we were trying to sell them at rumbelows along the NC-100 and didn't understand why until I heard we'd bought a whole load of them that we didn't need because someone fucked up and now we needed to get rid of them. I remember at one point we were flogging them at cost (this was after we'd been told not to sell rental plans, then to sell rental plans, then not to sell rental plans).",0,1292892450,null,0,false,0,c19suzo,t3_eoq7f,t1_c19suzo,t1_c19sn4u,null,1426644037,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,janoo1989,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"It's ""adult Doctor Who."" It's very dark and nihilistic. The characters are very flawed and Jack Harkness is like an imperfect Doctor (his damning decisions are actually shown). 

Personally, I don't think the alien show format matches the tone of the show as perfectly as it should. There are some monsters that just look silly and on Doctor Who, it seems to fit just fine but it's weird on such a dark show. However, it's still a great show; it's a bit inconsistent and even on the great episodes, there are big letdowns (giant Godzilla death thing - wtf?) In that sense, I completely understand the love/hate thing. I also think that it is a show that takes time to get used to and appreciate. 

On the whole though, it's a fantastic show. Once you get through the finale of series 2, you can't deny how good it is. The series 2 finale and Children of Earth just rips your heart to shreds, steps on it then defecates on it. It's like a part of you dies (along with ... nvm). No other show has done that to me except maybe The Wire.

Finally, throughout the show (especially Children of Earth), I found myself going ""Where the hell is the Doctor?"" and ""If the Doctor were, here, this wouldn't be a problem."" The show plays with you in this way and in the end, you'll find yourself having a greater appreciation for Doctor Who.

**TL;DR** - It's inconsistent, takes a while to get used to, and is inappropriately silly at times; but Torchwood is the quintessential nihilistic show. Very few shows, just break you the way this one does. It also heightens your appreciation of Doctor Who.",0,1292911579,null,0,true,0,c19tw4c,t3_ep5n4,t1_c19tw4c,t3_ep5n4,null,1426644519,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

In the lower-leagues up to around League 1 the way to win games is to have a fantastic striker and a good, young goalkeeper. I had both of those and getting into the football league was a doddle, even though I almost financially ruined the club in doing it. I took West Brom as my parent club and a few of their loanees done a fantastic job for us in getting to League 1 (namely Reuben Reid). From there I got into the Championship and I just about managed a mid-table finish after investing heavily in upcoming youth players.

I've always been a fan of buying upcoming youth players, in the hope that some of them would turn out to be Premier League class. Thankfully I won the Championship playoffs with some good older signings and made a bunch of older signings in the Premier League that could still do a job for us, like Landon Donovan from Sampdoria and Arshavin for free. On top of the 4-4-2 I played two different 4-5-1 formations, one with two attacking midfielders and one with two wingers, aptly named ""Arrow"" and ""Barca Style"".

To cut the last part short as I'm in work. I was also manager of Paraguay at the time and I noticed a few good youngsters and bought them with a bit of luck in regards to work permits. I signed two Turkish defenders who have turned out to be world-class in addition to a great English keeper and a Canadian striker who is now by far the best Canadian in the game. We won the Champions League in our first year, thanks to an easy draw and a ton of luck in getting Arsenal and AC Milan, two teams that have become considerably worse in my game.

The biggest challengers in the Premier League are now Tottenham and Everton (who now have a rich owner).

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"Sorry, I was shitfaced last night (hence the immature response that I have no recollection of typing). Apologies all round. In the cold light of day...

You're right, I'm coming from an early 90s perspective. The 8256 was a bit of a nightmare (as was the 9256 and PCW10 - I don't think it was the 16 but I only ever saw one of them and it never sold). People would buy them because they were cheap and came with a printer, then return them because they were so limited. The 512's didn't have the memory problem but the CF2 disks were expensive and less ubiquitous than the 3.5"" equivalents (not a problem for the 9256 I think, this was about 20 years ago so I might be wrong about a few things) but ISTR the common issues were the disk drives messing up (something to do with the belt and the vertical orientation of the drive on the 8256 according to our techie) and the inability to share files because of the 3"" drive (as everyone else used 5.25"" or 3.5"" disks, this became a bigger problem as time went on). By about 1991 we kept the Amstrad stock away from people and steered them towards Canons and Olivettis that looked more like traditional word processors than computers so it was easier to set expectations. Then we ended up selling Olivetti PCs that were really shockingly built.

You're right about the ST using GEM, but people didn't want that either. I got roped into helping out in the computer section at WH Smiths in 87 and parents would come in and buy Atari STs because they were cheaper than Amigas, but by 1989 no-one was buying STs at all. I remember we sold out of Amiga 500s in 89 and some people bought STs but took them back in the new year and bought Amigas on order instead. I don't think the ST was a particularly bad machine for it's day, it was just that the Amiga was the one that the kids wanted and the prices weren't sufficiently different until later on. There was either a Falcon or a TT on display at Rumbelows, but it never sold, occasionally people would ask about it but they'd never buy it. We had it next to the Amigas when Escom bought us. The mail order bit at Evesham sold a few STs and STes, but nowhere near as much as the Amiga.

*(Bit of background, at Rumbelows you'd get commission based on rental agreements, so renting a computer made sense as it was a lot cheaper than buying one and you could upgrade at the end of it. I think it was 93 when everyone was told to stop selling rentals and start selling full price. None of us knew how to justify this stuff in terms of a one-off price instead of rental, so everything went tits up big time. We were then told that PCs were the future - although Commodore were supposed to be coming out with something big to follow up the A1200. We put Wolfenstein on all the PCs and we sold a few but nothing great, then Escom bought us and we ended up selling Escom PCs, then they bought Commodore and we were told to sell Amigas with the Quavers game, but by that point we were demoing Doom and Tie fighter on the PCs. It just wasn't going to happen)*

BTW - all this is based on my memory, which is as flawed and limited as the 8256's, so apologies for any errors or omissions, and for being an idiot last night. It might have sold better in the 80s, but in the 90s Amstrad really weren't shifting much by way of computers compared to everyone else, nor Viglen, at least in the places I worked around Wellingborough at the time.",0,1292928938,null,0,false,0,c19uhyy,t3_eoq7f,t1_c19uhyy,t1_c19syv4,null,1426644802,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Ideally I'd like to take Computer Science and German at a German uni, but there are few Unis who teach in English, and even fewer who would offer that course. In the entire of the UK, there are nine institutions offering Computer Science and German — factor in the course being in English and I can't imagine there are any such courses in Germany.

I originally intended to take a gap year in Germany and then study, but the rise in UK tuition fees put a stop to that idea. Studying at a German uni would allow me to take that gap year (and get some valuable experience in preparation for uni).

There are institutions that use a mixture of languages and that even allow you to write your thesis in English, but you do have to shop around.

The thing is there is the Erasmus programme and the Bologna process. These can allow you to go abroad and to take credits with you when you return. When you are on an Erasmus semester, you pay nothing for tuition whether at your primary University or the one where you study as an Erasmus student. You just pay for your keep (and may even get some help towards that). You may want to talk to your prospective UK uni to see if they have any partner institutions with whom they cooperate in Germany.

Note, that you should always be careful to ensure that when looking at German universities to ensure that you are enquiring as an EU student rather than non-EU. Even if you pay tuition for a full course at German level as an EU person, it is less than €1200/year.

Note that German universities are very different to British ones. Much looser structure which can be confusing with usually a fight to obtain your ""Scheine"", to show the course you have taken and the ""Noten"" at the end.

Absolutely. I'm at work now and I've yet to find a way to play FM at work without getting sacked so it'll be a few hours until I can get the screenshots ready. I'll edit this post (or post again) once I get the screenshots ready.

As it's 2018 and I tend to keep my teams young my team is mostly regen players, and more than anything my ability to mix and match tactics and my ability to find a world-class regen player at least 50% of the time is why I managed to win the Champions League in eight years.

Finally, I'm still yet to buy FM11 since I've had nothing but trouble over the past few years when I've bought FM on release day. I also didn't want to buy the new version without winning the Champions League with Redditch. Now I've got a new addition to my Christmas list.

true,EnderMB,null,null,"&gt; What's your usual approach? If there's on thing I love it's when I take a player from obscurity to meteoric heights, but for me it's always a bit hit and miss :/

I was landing a bunch of free talent up until I hit the Championship but then I hit the wall. After (luckily) coming second in the Championship I decided to start spending and noticed that there were a lot of upcoming players in certain countries like Turkey and the UAE. Two of my defensive signings at around £5M have paid off tremendously and a Spanish youngster that was okay allowed me to trade in with cash for a phenomenal Spanish youngster that signed for Spurs. I signed a couple of American players who came good too. I was signing and selling far too much and once I had found my team in the Premier League I stopped and started replacing holes in my team.

The best advice I can give to someone is to look at certain strong nations and see what they're producing. The scouts are more often than not completely useless, so it's best to ignore them when possible.

To be fair, the only reason I won the Premier League and the Champions League this season was through the old Harry Redknapp technique of overspending and bleeding the team dry. We had done really well, but many of my players were knackered out during the winter so I splashed the cash a bit in January and brought in two world-class wingers (4-5-1 always works for me in the Premier League) and the rest sorted itself out. The club is currently spending ridiculous amounts on wages, but at least I managed to win it.

I think I'll move onto the Club World Championships next and call it a day on FM10.",0,1292949612,null,0,false,0,c19vao0,t3_ep0vn,t1_c19vao0,t1_c19v5u3,null,1426645173,2,false,Redditch,t5_2rtiz,2

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"Nope. I've been on the inside of some of these types of organisations and even they don't know where or how much all the money is. There'll be team A squirrelling a few hundred million in this structured vehicle, team B stuff mattresses somewhere, team C selling empty mattresses to team B which were bought using money from team A's vehicle. Somewhere amongst all this would be a massive finance system that looks at the money, goes 'fucked if I know' and spits out a report.

One company I worked for reported earnings that later turned out to be £3 billion higher for the year than what they'd actually taken because their finance system automatically rounded up calculations that resulted in fractions of a penny being left over. Each 0.1p off a floating point VAT calculation was turned into 1p in an integer conversion. It took 18 months to find it. In the end rather than restate earnings (which is what was legally required) and claim the tax back they fiddled the books to avoid the embarrassment.

BP's a pretty bad example too as it usually pays dividends to shareholders (which is why it's the number one investment for pension funds). Dividends can only be paid on profits, and of course profits are taxable. Thus you can calculate the profits from the total dividends paid - or rather you can guestimate if they were lying on their tax return if you're HMRC. Because BP pay the dividends their share value is (or rather used to be) astronomic and they had to keep paying them to maintain their value and insulate their share value from oil shocks. Consequently BP were rather good for paying tax - I'm not saying they were a model company, no doubt a lot of their stuff never touched UK shores and I'm sure they'll have tried to get everything they could out of each company they were in, but they do at least make an effort to pay tax.

Perhaps Topshop is a better example. Topshop operates in 20 countries, one of which is the UK. So you pick a country to congregate your excess cash into with a decent tax regime (Switzerland would be good), then dump your profits into them. Lets say one year you want to take a big chunk of cash like £1.2 billion, you're looking at quite a hit on that tax-wise. When it comes to the dividend that's where you get unstuck. Not so. You make sure the company's parent group is privately owned by your non-dom wife (living as a tax exile in monaco) and get it paid to her. You then get the company to take out a loan in order to pay the dividend of 400-odd million (which remember could only be paid on profits) plus a general payout to make up the rest. This works because the interest on the loan offsets company profits but the principal part of the loan can be spread over the period (say 7 or 8 years if you're friendly with the people providing the loan, maybe the Barclay Brothers).

So you see, even though Topshop are a UK high street retailer, the guy taking money out of the top doesn't actually owe any tax because his wife (who legitimately owns the company and legitimately lives in a country where you pay no tax) gets it instead. It's genius and completely above board and if you change the law people like that will just find another one, because they will pay someone £200 million to get out of paying £300 million of tax (because then you pocket the difference).

In fact, in one of the companies I ran I remember taking home £65k in a year and paying about 2-3 grand in tax, and I wasn't making anywhere near the kind of sums Philip Green was making. I was just on self assessment with a decent accountant.

So I'm sorry, but unfortunately taxing the shit out of them isn't going to work, and if we impede their profits sufficiently they will leave or at least start to transfer new jobs to other locations.",0,1292962171,null,0,false,0,c19w6lv,t3_epawy,t1_c19w6lv,t1_c19vpn7,null,1426645603,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It didn't mean you were wrong, it was just my way of saying you're basing your argument on the logical fallacy that two wrongs make a right - which is a fallacy of relevance.  By pointing out internet mail order companies base themselves in Guernsey to avoid small orders incurring VAT, and speculating that some people here may order from these companies is irrelevant to whether it's ethically correct for companies to base themselves in a PO Box in some little town in Sweden just to avoid paying tax.  Saying that both are legal is also irrelevant to a question of whether it's ethically acceptable, or whether it should be legal.

The ""problem"" is that those with the most money, be they companies or individuals, are able to exploit loopholes in laws (BTW a loophole, by definition, must be legal) in order to avoid paying taxes, while hard-working people with modest incomes who are not able to afford high priced tax accountants, pay (broadly) what they're meant to, thereby incurring a disproportionate burden.

LVCR was never intended to apply to companies who export from the UK to the Isle of Man then import back to the UK. 
Corporation taxes were not set up with the expectation that companies would register their head office as being an abandoned flat above some old woman's house in Spitsbergen.
ISAs on the other hand, AFAIK are pretty much used as they were intended and are therefore not relevant in a debate about loopholes.

Two wrongs don't make a right.

Just because it's technically legal, doesn't make it right.

You're right that pressure can be brought to bear on governments to close loopholes.  However the lobbying power of big businesses, and the fear they'll move even more operations abroad make action unlikely, unless coordinated internationally, which is even more unlikely.  It is therefore perfectly legitimate to put pressure on the companies themselves and raise consumer awareness of these issues, so that these actions bring about such negative publicity that it becomes bad for business and they start paying their way legitimately.  Some companies may even start to use it as a selling point in their advertising (we are based in Britain and pay our taxes in Britain, so buy...)

Really?  I smell a red herring argument - namely a fallacy whereby the arguer brings up an irrelevant point that does nothing the either prove or disprove the conclusion.

Classic example: 

Driver:  You shouldn't fine me for speeding.  What about all the murderers and robbers going around free? Why don't you go after real criminals?

Here the accused has raised an irrelevant point that says nothing about the dangers of speeding, its damaging effects on society as a whole, nor whether they were actually speeding when they were pulled over.  It may be true that there are robbers who haven't been caught, but that does not stand as a valid defence or explanation for all other crimes.

Similarly you simply named a bunch of vague, aimlessly articulated grievances which said nothing about the exploitation of tax loopholes.  ""But... but... some teachers are bad I expect, things went wrong with a public service once... I remember reading something...""

I'm sure we'd all like a world where nobody ever died needlessly and everything worked with perfect efficiency and effectiveness.  I'm not sure any society or system's ever achieved that, but we should always press tirelessly to move in that direction.  I think a fair amount of political pressure is already brought to bear when serious mistakes are made, as it absolutely should, though I suppose it's always possible for outcries to be louder.

I would love to see more creative risks taken, but obviously - it isn't my money. Commercial product developers are too fixated with being a success, coupled with the huge financial requirements for advertising and mass production mean that small and new firms would have issues competing - there's only so many substitutes you can have in a market before you have to be truly exceptional to beat established brands.

I personally think on this basis that if the Government enacted policies causing firms to leave the country that it would open the market up for new businesses. Instead of effectively being able to hold us to ransom, we start to create for ourselves.

Even if they had, then no, it wouldn't be fallacious. If the premises of an argument are false you can call it unsound, but a fallacy suggests it's invalid (i.e. that the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises, even if the premises are true)

I would think protesters are responding to the cuts, hence why this has come up suddenly now, so they're probably thinking that the impact of the cuts would be lessened, rather than overall spending increased, if tax loopholes were either not present or exploited less.

No boycott could ever be effective, and besides, it's not our fault that they're operating in a totally immoral fashion, it's theirs.

I mentioned several companies and a couple of ways in which anyone can avoid tax. Those companies use Jersey-based warehouses to avoid VAT - passing the savings onto you. I bet that a lot of people who preach about tax avoidance by that evil Vodafone (whose tax bill **we still don't know**) and that vile Green, actually do engage in tax avoidance albeit on a smaller scale.

&gt; if something is utterly wrong but still legal

I don't think it is wrong (if a company or someone can do it, fair play to them). You might think it is. This is subjective - no one is correct or incorrect.

&gt; And that's tens of billions of pounds we're making up, and that could be spent on better public services and to create a better society. We wouldn't need tuition fees at all if big business and the super-wealthy paid what they owed, just like everyone else.

You might not be aware of that huge deficit, and the even larger debt that we have thanks to 13 years of Labour incompetence and waste - all due to the fact that Labour were spending far more than they were taking in in tax receipts. 

Assuming that you got everyone to pay every penny that they ""morally"" should be, it would probably be used to pay off the debt. Oh, and Labour tried throwing money at things, didn't really work, did it?

Unfortunately, it seems that many live in a lalaland where instead of living within our means, we'll just attempt to get the rich/large business to pay even more.

Yes, no law stops you from clearing the snow but any action on your part affecting the snow and ice outside your property means you are responsible if someone slips and injures themselves in a manner that could be suggested was made more likely by your actions.

Just because most people will see it as their own fault and just curse the snow and ice doesn't mean it definitely can't happen. 

Personally - I'm sick of the lawsuit culture that's developing over here. I think people should apply some damned common sense when walking on snow and consider the possibility they may fall on it and thus it is why it isn't considered safe to walk on.
If I want to clear the snow, I should be entitled to without fear of a lawsuit.

The only reason everyone hasn't lost their license is because speed cameras are noticed before they can catch people committing crimes. Road safety policy needs to reflect this.

Speeding (and driving too fast for the conditions - something speed cameras are unaware of) accounts for only 17% of road fatalities (and only 5% of accidents). That is, 83% of the 2,222 deaths last year were not caused by speed. The biggest killers were not visually checking the road for other users, careless pedestrians, and losing control of the vehicle.

Riddle me this: if you had a legislative wand, would you reduce the national speed limit, built up area speed limit, or school limit by 10%, 25%, 50% or 75% if it meant saving 10% of road deaths a year. So, for example; if reducing the speed limit on the motorway by 35 mph meant saving the lives of say, 25 people, would you do it?
