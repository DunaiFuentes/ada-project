I would like a more regional approach to voting.  I live near Derby in an election borough called something stupid like Mid Derby Central.  It is a random shape of geography with no commonality underlying it's electorate.  I fear it might only exist to gerrymander.  Derbyshire votes being pooled to elect multiple politicians makes more sense, as it can capture regional issues with greater representation.  I don't care if Derbyshire elects only 1 or 2 liberal candidates - the fact is it gives my vote representation.  Surely something our democracy should strive to do.

Thank you for all your answers.

What I consider as Central London is anything in Zone 1.  I'll be working near Covent Garden, I would like to live in a radius bellow 15km.  I calculated £600pcm after spending a few weeks on Gumtree looking at flats.  I noticed a lot of decent looking places for below £150pw.  
My employer is offering me 5 days to find accommodations before starting, is that a reasonable amount of time?

Ocularsinister2, I am an avid biker, would you consider cycling as a realistic alternative to busses and tube, or does the weather not support it?  I have my Oyster card saved from my previous visits.  I recently topped it up on TFL.gov.uk in preparation for my arrival.

_tweaks, I appreciate your welcoming spirit.  Beer sounds like a great idea.  How long have you lived in London so far?  What was your experience like upon arriving?
I like your idea of taking weekend trips, I thought of that too.  I am eager to explore the UK as well as the rest of Europe!  Easy jet seems to offer reasonable fares to other cities... hostels, are they mostly clean?

rbnc,  are there any particular areas I should really avoid?  I am not crossing the ocean just to get shot ;)

true,joethepro36,cnty-wales,The Valleys,"I'm glad defence is being cut but this is hilarious to watch. A conservative cutting the military no less.

We could go oh so much farther in defence cuts you know. All we need to defend the British Isles in practical terms is a smaller regular army (perhaps 60k soldiers), a much, much larger TA (perhaps 250k soldiers) and a well trained but small airforce that focuses on air superiority. Notice how I failed to mention the Navy? Well so long as we don't care about the overseas areas the armed forces can be very, very small.

The only nation with enough military force projection to invade us is the USA and I somehow don't think they want to invade anytime soon.

Difficulties come in balancing an ability to defend the overseas territories and perform peace-keeping missions while trying to have a military as small as possible. The Falklands with their across the world distance and need for a fleet is a particularly thorny issue.

Of course when in war or (surprise!) invaded we switch to a total war economy to assist the defence of our lands. our unique position allows us two benefits:

1) We are an island nation and amphibious assaults are incredibly difficult to pull off. You have to have air, army and fleet working in conjunction to attack, get more troops in the area in the area than your enemy and then supply them adequately. To put it in laymens terms, even without the Royal Navy, the Germans could have never invaded us.

2) An aggressor would not be within the EU or NATO. The only possible ones could be China (barely feasible) and Russia in the semi-distant future. And they'd launch campaigns through the rest of Europe first, they wouldn't pick us out first. This would give us time to prepare for invasion, summon troops and build war material while using our regular army as an expeditionary force within Europe.

We as a nation have possibly the best position to defend ourselves in wartime bar the USA (who have strategic depth).",0,1287557317,null,0,false,0,c12u9tp,t3_dtf9k,t1_c12u9tp,t3_dtf9k,null,1426525263,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

NB: Shoreditch and Hoxton are pretty much interchangeable, they're so close together.

Ye, Dalston is just north of Shoreditch really - just a mile or two really. Shoreditch is slowly being commercialised, although it's still a great area. Lots of people who used to live in Shoreditch (but can no longer afford to) have moved just up the road to Dalston which is fast becoming 'the new Shoreditch' and is what it was like there a number of years ago.

Dalston has lots of appeal insofar that it is central, has lots of young people and therefore lots of interesting non-chain bars / cafes etc. The other big appeal is that it has a good stock of housing, so rents are still pretty cheap. You'll find lots of artsy types around there, mixed in with a few city workers. It's a big mix.

There was a great article in The Sunday Times called ""Shoreditch is over let's go to Dalston"" - but unfortunately it's now behind the Rupert Murdoch paywall. Still, search around for 'dalston new shoreditch' and you'll get plenty of opinion about the characteristics of the place.

City are a definite threat, as are Arsenal and Tottenham, if we don't keep grinding out the wins. I think we need to pick up a few players ourselves this January, as we're looking thin right now. Our youth are very good, very bright, but we shouldn't be fielding a substitute's bench filled with teenagers.

It would mean we would probably have to give up on a couple of prospects that we've been chasing (Neymar, Lukaku come to mind). Kalou or Anelka would probably depart at the season's end I think, as there will not be enough room for them. 

On the other hand, Ancelotti has handled the personal lives of Ashley Cole and John Terry very well. He has managed the egos of Drogba and Anelka exceptionally well, and we can finally see the two of them play together. I think in terms of player management, he could do a better job than SAF did. Rooney is a proven player in the EPL, can definitely withstand the rigors of the league, and score a ton of goals.

My conclusion: With our front three each at least 30 years old, it's time we brought in a new, proven striker. Rooney fits the bill exactly, and while it may make it tough to rotate everyone for a season or two, or force an early departure, he will greatly benefit the team if he can fit in.",0,1287581191,null,0,false,0,c12uutf,t3_dttpl,t1_c12uutf,t3_dttpl,null,1426525534,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

Where were all those waders and wildfowl during said glaciation?  Not in the Severn estuary for sure.

Yet they survived.

The problem with the RSPB and many other wildlife protection outfits is that they view environmental and habitat changes on very short timescales roughly equivalent to a human lifespan.  Much larger local environmental changes happen continuously all over the world as a result of entirely natural processes. Witness the recent flooding in Pakistan.

The Severn barrage is inconsequential in local environmental and habitat terms on reasonable (thousands of years) timescales; it only has a design life of 120 years.

You'll note that although much of northern Britain is rising, but because the crust has a certain flexural rigidity, southern England is sinking.  This, combined with eustatic sea-level rise will cause much of what is currently tidal flats in the Severn Estuary to be flooded in fairly short order. Relative sea level rise in the area is up to 8.5 mm/yr, which may not sound like much until you realize that amounts to 8.5 *metres* in just 1000 years - or about half the maximum tidal range of 15 m in the Severn Estuary.

What hurt former industrial areas was not the removal of industry as claimed. What hurt them was the fact it went overnight.

true,Marogian,eng-essex,Essex boy in London,"All the reasons listed in that article about undermining the independence are based on politics, not technical requirements. The deterrent *is* independent. The fact that our Government would almost certainly never use it without America is beside the point. It is an entirely political consideration. As I said about maintenance, if the US decided to cut us off right now we'd be in trouble with respect to being able to maintain the technology for more than a couple of years, but that doesn't mean we're unable to fire them on our own.

I don't understand what you mean by this:
&gt;There simply is no money to be made by sitting on a fence, wouldn't you agree ?

The arguments in favour of the UK having an independent nuclear deterrent were from the Cold War perspective that the Soviet Union could have invaded Western Europe using conventional forces. NATO would not have been able to stop them and some people believed that the US would not be willing to use nuclear weapons first, inviting attack on mainland US which wouldn't otherwise be considered. France and Britain obtained their own weapons so that the Soviet Union would be disinclined to invade Western Europe.

I personally don't think the UK needs a nuclear deterrent any more because its primary justification was defence of Western Europe from the Soviet Union, which is no longer a risk. I do believe, however, that given the amount of time and resources required to build such a technology, it would be prudent to maintain a nuclear laboratory with the necessary skills and resources to rapidly construct nuclear weapons (in 6 months or so) if the geopolitical situation changed. Or just stockpile the warheads, whatever is most cost-effective.

I don't like the idea of something crazy going on in China/Russia and the UK not being able to build back a deterrent in less than 5 years.

All universities have a contract to supply education to the government for a certain number of students. In addition universities can offer additional places that are not contracted by the government. This is why UK students currently pay £3,290 whereas overseas students typically pay £15,000 per year. The UK student contract allows the government to stipulate the fee chargeable to the student and the government pays the rest. The Browne review proposal is that 80% of the current teaching contract funds will be removed, therefore a university would wish to raise their fee to compensate for the lost revenue. To fully compensate the university would have to raise fees for courses to around that for international students, eg. £15,000. Obviously there might be a reduction in students and this would lead to a reduction in courses or even whole universities, but they would still cost £15,000, only far less people would be educated and only those who can afford to pay. Selection by wealth rather than ability. But then, maybe that's what we want, only the rich few to go to university.

- sport.co.uk and tribalfootball.com (to name but two) are the rags of the internet; they post rumours and sensational headlines for the sake of page hits. 

- goal.com is garbage.

- vitalchelsea used to be good pre Roman. Nowadays the community mostly talks about fantasy football and signing the flavour of the month; the staff post rubbish entertainment PR campaigns disguised as content; the editor mostly copypastas transfer rumours for page hits, some of the (older) writers and commenters however do know their stuff and regularly go to games.

true,palehorse864,null,null,"I think the 2005-2009 era new series Dalek design was possibly the best ever, and that includes all the designs from the classic era that I have seen.

Extending the ear lights gave them a lot more character, and the blue eye stalk just gave them a very nice visual style.   

The only thing the iDaleks really had going for them was size. They were as tall or taller than the Doctor, and that perhaps made them a shade more intimidating... That is, if they didn't all look like plastic. I actually didn't mind that after seeing it. They looked very good from the front, and while the blue eyestalk was far superior, the added designs around the center of the eyestalk were kind of cool.  I just didn't go for the eyepiece that looked like it had a halogen bulb at the center. 

The main issue I had with the iDaleks was that their ""head"" looked so tiny compared to the body and they had that bit that stuck out in the back. It was more comical than anything. 

I would have loved to hear the Doctor comment on the iDaleks.  ""How do you expect to intimidate anyone when you look like Quasimodo's dustbin"" :)

Take the 2005-2009 era daleks, give them back their look and just build them taller and bigger, but with the same proportions. Add the really cool black bit of the iDalek eyestalk. If they combined the outer parts of this eyestalk http://media.photobucket.com/image/dalek%20eyestalk/Stranger_uk/Doctor%20Who%20Matt%20Smith/vlcsnap-2010-01-02-13h20m55s26.jpg  with the blue light design, they might have something interesting.",0,1287871070,null,0,false,0,c137oze,t3_dvarm,t1_c137oze,t3_dvarm,null,1426531652,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

I asked my father, an English Environmental Health Officer of some years standing, about this. He says, basically, if it's in a smoke control area they need to use an ""approved"" device and ""authorised"" fuel, and if you read the act breastmilkofdeath linked, having a broken device (or using it badly) is no excuse.

If you are outside a smoke control area, then it's harder. Assuming that the law is the same in England-and-Wales and Scotland on this (a big if :s), then it's harder. There might be recourse in that one must not cause ""a nuisance"", but it's been a while since he did this and he's had a drink.

Of course, there are probably more generic nuisance or other laws you might be able to use, but hopefully you can get them bang to rights under the Clean Air Act.

There was no beef with waterside when I lived there, everyone just minded their own business. Truth be told I envied Waterside because they had larger flats and were just more friendly to socialising, none of the heavy fire door and narrow corridor bollocks you get in Charlton. There's also supposedly a rivalry between Harington and Hiscock buildings up on campus but that's just idiots being idiots really.

I don't really have a favourite place to go out to in Bath really, they're all mostly the same but my and my friends generally go to XL because it has (or used to have) very good value for money on a student night. However they seem to have stopped the 1 quid entry this year and the drinks prices have gone up as well :( I suppose my favourite night out is Discord on a wednesday night because I am a metalhead at heart. Not that Discord plays what I consider proper metal but I can turn up drunk, keep drinking and just throw myself around and nobody will give a shit, compared to other nightclubs where I will have to try and actually dance well and I can't be bothered with that shit.

It's not exactly beef in the sense of hating them, it's just annoying. I'm glad to live in Charlton - dunno which part of Waterside you've been in but all the rooms I've seen are smaller and wearier, smaller beds etc... They've been having problems with running water and stuff this year as well.

Beau Nash does cheap drinks on a monday night (pound a pint for Foster's and Strongbow) and you can get a special student discount card called a Barry card which gives you pretty awesome deals on food and drink in there but the place is full of itself on a monday and saturday night. I'm very suprised to hear that they turned you away because you didn't have your passport with you, they've only asked me for student ID and a driver's license. Maybe they don't like your accent? :P But in all seriousness if you're having trouble getting in through the main door ask one of your friends to open up the fire exit door opposite the stairs to the toilets, they usually open that up for smokers to use anyway.

Moles is ok, an expensive night out and the music isn't to my taste but I generally like the class of people that go in there. Weir Lounge is only really worth going to because it has the most incredible urinal in England. Second Bridge is expensive and pretentious, Blue Rooms is worth it if you buy a year pass for a fiver and go on one of the nights you can use it on (monday and thrusday/friday I think) but because it has no student nights it's full of lecherous middle-aged men looking for a cheap student gash. Gives me bad vibes that place.

The  truth of the matter in the decline of our economy, as I see it, was the bank bubble collapse and bailout.

Right from Thatcher and Reagan with the liberalising of the financial markets and self regulation, laissez-faire was the way to go. Unfortunately the lack of oversight and regulation has ultimately led to massive fraud and corruption with the inevitable start of a correction to the system. For various reasons governments decided to intervene not allowing the system to fully correct, those which caused the collapse through their criminal enterprise didn't go to jail and kept their jobs. 

Now the least wealthy and less well off will have to pay for it because they are an easy target and are in no position to refuse to hand over their money. Whilst those who caused it failed to suffer the consequence of their behaviour, a recipe for future trouble.

true,afty,null,null,"""Paul McGann is currently in New Zealand, a guest at the Armageddon Pop Culture Expo (Auckland, New Zealand) this weekend. On Saturday he appeared on a panel and revealed what is to be the 'new' costume for the Eighth Doctor.

The costume consists of a double-breasted black Naval jacket, with gold buttons. Part of of the ensemble is a courier pouch bag. However, the shirt and trousers were actually McGann's own and not part of the costume.

Also revealed is a new sonic screwdriver, courtesy of Weta Workshop, the wizards behind the effects on The Lord of the Rings. The screwdriver is similar to the one used by the current Doctor, Matt Smith, but has a wooden handle.

The revision comes some fourteen years since the original Eighth Doctor image was established for the 1996 TV Movie; this is now felt to be a little out of date and the new costume - still a work in progress - is said to be used for future promotional purposes.

No other information in known at present, other than this is an unofficial costume - but it is believed to have the blessing of the BBC.""

I definitely agree that appearing in ""The Hobbit"" can only be good for Freeman's career, but I too have been unsure about it especially since Del Toro decided not to direct it. I think he would have done a much better job with it than Jackson, who handled some of the script and direction in the LotR trilogy rather ham-handedly, despite the overall product being quite good.

Whilst obviously anyone here would object to being 'spied' on by our government, it'd be appreciated if we knew what 'snooping plan' this is, what legislation has been obviously slipped under our nose that you're referring to, and possibly better defined petitions. 

Your present petition; 
&gt; * 
Don't spy on our e-mail, phone and internet
* Don't break your election promise to ?reverse the rise of the  surveillance state?
* Don't waste billions on Big Brother projects


Obviously there still need to be occasions when the Government can look at personal data, such as to prevent terrorist action. What we need is a set limit to what the government can and cannot do, and a fair level of justification for each action. 

What justifies a Big Brother 'project'? To install more security cameras in areas with frequent crimes, or to actually move cameras into people's houses? Already the [first](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1205607/Shock-figures-reveal-Britain-CCTV-camera-14-people--China.html) will be referred to as a [slippery slope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope) towards the latter, even if the first will genuinely protect you, whilst the second is obviously unfavourable. 


I'm sure your influence is noticeable in this, but when you say the blatantly evil government tried to;

Hell, you even mentioned it on your [article](http://www.38degrees.org.uk/page/speakout/extremeinternetl), so I'm not quite sure why you're not mentioning them here too.

And two, they stop charges accumulating after ten days, so there's no way she's still being charged £10 a day for this overdrawn account, no fucking way.

Unless of course she's still paying the £8/month for the account, and if she is then it's her own fault for not downgrading the account as soon as this happened, 5 mins with the bank manager would have sorted that out.

To me, this adds dimension to the character.  He's not just some aloof Time Lord who is too perfect.  He has his character flaws, and is more interesting because of them.

As much as I loved Dalek as an episode, (And actually enjoyed the idea behind Dalkes in Manhattan if it weren't for the stupid pigmen plot, and Dalek Sec looking so dodgy. Depresion era New York was a great idea for a Dalek episode to be set in.) involving Sarah Jane, Davros, and the Daleks in one episode made it something extra special for anyone who watched Genesis of the Daleks.  

People criticized it for saying that the whole spinning Daleks made it too silly, but the Daleks have been far sillier in the classic series.  Dizzy Daleks anyone? 

One criticism that never really settled right with me was the idea that the Daleks weren't scary because they were more numerous and much harder to kill.  I actually prefer them this way. Watching four of them obliterate a number of cybermen without taking a scratch was thrilling. Plus, having them cause the companions to quake in fear was also a moment of awesome for them.

They has a sort of dangerous factor in the classic series, but they were destroyed too easily to really make them overly intimidating.  The fifth doctor blinded one and managed to shove it out a second story door.  The dalek fell about 8-10 feet and exploded on impact with the pavement. The dalek inside the armor survived and went on to attack a few other people without its shell, but it was ridiculous to see its armored exterior break into so many pieces after such a little fall.  

There was also the chase where a Dalek chases the crew off of a wooden ship, falls in the ocean from the edge of the boat, and the armor breaks open when it hits the water. I think this may have been more of an unintentional snafu with the prop though so it may not count.  

Granted, its' more annoying when they have to be deus ex machinae'ed more or less (not sure if it counts as a deus ex machina though in anything but the s4 finale, since the whole void thing was set up in advance and such.)

Yes, true. Most of the references to it have been out-of-universe by the writers, which moves onto your *next* point.

RAFO/WAFO are cover lines. (They mean ""read and find out""/""watch..."" if you didn't know.)

""He lies"" is a look into how Moffat sees the Doctor. Referring back to it time and again develops, as I said before, a certain amount of untrustworthiness in your (and the characters') perception of the things the Doctor says.

Also, your cover line explanation doesn't really fit in the context of the questions of how many regenerations he has and how old he is.

I actually don't think they've made him any less trustworthy. That's part of the problem. I know I've said he's becoming more untrustworthy, but I want to clarify here. When I say he's become more untrustworthy, I'm referring to what we as Whovians can believe when he's talking. As a *character* however, I think he's remained the same trustworthy Doctor as the past two (obviously not for every Doctor, especially not 1). Everyone still trusts him absolutely by the end of the first season.

Amy goes through a weird transitional phase as well. Which was quite awesome and well done, but odd in how it pairs with the untrustworthiness I think they're trying to develop in the Doctor (but not particularly well).

In ""Flesh and Stone"" the Doctor and Amy have the following exchange:

&gt;Doctor: Amy, you need to start trusting me.

&gt;Amy: But you don't always tell me the truth.

&gt;Doctor: If I always told you the truth, you wouldn't have to trust me.

But prior to that point, I can't really think of any lies that the Doctor told her outright (I'd really love to hear some; I don't doubt there are, I just can't presently remember any). Despite her vocal distrust for the Doctor, Amy continues to do what the Doctor tells her to (excluding standard Companion disobeying whenever he tells her to stay) culminating in a dilemma for Amy in ""Amy's Choice"" about whether or not to trust the Doctor, but only after a dark, outside influence suggests that the Doctor is untrustworthy. Recall that at first she resists against the Dream Lord's hints that the Doctor can't be trusted?

Which is just interesting to me. I'd never really thought much about it, and most of this is just coming to me as I'm thinking about it. I'm sort of using you as a sounding board.

There just seems to be a sort of *disconnect* in the actions of the characters and the things they say. River Song says the Doctor lies (of course he does, but mentioning it so distinctly, ""Rule #1,"" has to mean something beyond just the obvious ""yes, he lies, like everyone else""), the Dream Lord (the Doctor's own darkness) suggests the Doctor is untrustworthy, Amy vocally distrusts the Doctor at first because she thinks he lied to her about coming back, and yet everyone trusts the Doctor completely (Amy says she trusts him in ""Amy's Choice"" and River Song says it in ""Flesh and Stone"").

And it's cute and awesome that the Doctor can inspire such trust in other characters...but when paired with the constant, unwarranted suggestions that he's somehow untrustworthy, it just seems like it falls flat.

Later, three of every race the Doctor has ever pissed off assemble in front of it (including the Judoon, whom he didn't actually piss off) and toss the Doctor inside because, for some reason, that fixes the crack. Then they all vanish instead of using the opportunity to take over the earth without the Doctor interfering *as they happen to be standing on it*. Oh, and I forgot, they also don't blast each other into confetti on sight or even after the Doctor is in the Pandorica... despite the fact that several of them are mortal enemies and others simply live to eliminate other species. if that makes sense to you, great.

I don't buy that. Rory (who, himself, is a member of a race the Doctor has pissed off) walked right up to the Pandorica with nary a soul around and popped it right open. Don't you think that if the earth was the only safe place then they would have stayed there? And if they were there together, they wouldn't have fought it out? I don't think there's a fan of the show who would see Judoon, Daleks, Slitheen, Cybermen, Silurians, Sontarans, Siccarax (and many other foes whose name start with an ""S"" sound) without asking ""Where the hell did they all go?""

I love the show. I've loved it for 30 years. I will keep watching and re-watching (*including* The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang), but that was one seriously shit piece of plot creation.
