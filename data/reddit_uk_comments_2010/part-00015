This is one of my favorite episodes of the entire re-booted series' run. It's also one of the reasons why Donna is my absolute favorite of Doctor 9+'s companions. Sure, I loved Rose. Martha was great. Amel-- er, Amy, is awesome, too. But only Donna had that... tragic part of herself. 

[When Donna first met the Doctor I hated her because she was a total bitch to him throughout the entire episode. Her life was pathetic but I didn't feel sorry for her. I nodded approvingly when she refused to join him in the TARDIS. After she did join him she was awesome. ""Turn Left"" was so fucking sad because she stopped being awesome, her life was once again pathetic, but you knew as the viewer that she had that potential for greatness. Later she finally became the DoctorDonna and she was even better than before (""The Universe has been waiting for me!"" ...yes, we were). But then... sigh. Everything... worse than death when she had to go back to step one with no chance to ever again reach step two. So tragic. So awesome.](/spoiler)

true,antmansbigxmas,eccleston,Eccleston,"I had this sort of long-arc conclusion in mind for the Doctor. First he travels to Earth about 40 years after the events of ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"" and takes on a companion that he later discovers is Susan's son. He mentors him and trains him to be a Time Lord, more rigorously than his previous companions. In the end, one race has to fill the power vacuum left by the Gallifreyans and assume the status of Keepers of Time. Of course, all the bad guys want to be this, but the Doctor wants the human race to do it, which is why he's been travelling with human companions for so long, he's been preparing them. Finally, both the Doctor and his great-great grandson are mortally injured, and before he dies, the Doctor gives the other man the keys to the TARDIS, and tells him he has to be the Doctor now and lead the human race into a new era. then you see the doctor walk away, leaving it ambiguous as to whether he really died. The other guy regenerates as well, as he's a Gallifreyan, and blah blah blah it continues...

this would tie together the themes of the entire show, i.e. the potential for humanity's greatness, and explain his motivation for taking on companions. Also, with a newly regenerated protagonist in the TARDIS, the status quo is basically restored, except his backstory is different, and he will act differently from the Doctor. Sort of how the Doctor's backstory was updated for the new series, it gave the writers new psychological territory to explore.

true,Marogian,eng-essex,Essex boy in London,"Well, obviously he's very left wing which isn't necessarily a problem, as I'm not exactly a right-winger. What struck me was his belief in centralisation and planning, which I honestly would associate more with Communism rather than Socialism.

My idea of effective socialism would be something similar to a Scandiavian-style: free enterprise, little central planning, but high taxes to fund a highly effective social net.

Benn's spoke in favour of the Government (albeit highly democratic and accountable) deciding what people should do, how they should do it and then moving resources about that way. This seems to me to be fundamentally unliberal, despite Benn's other ideas about personal freedom...

His support for this was his experiences during WW2, how the country worked and how effective central planning was. I don't think that this evidence is particularly strong when the British economy during WW2 is objectively studied.

He also seemed to have a form of selective memory. Now I'm a young guy, 21, so I don't directly remember the things he's speaking about, but when he was talking about his support of the mining unions under Thatcher he was speaking about them as if they were perfect, that Thatcher's Government was ridiculously evil and took cruel pleasure in destroying the Unions.

My understanding of it, from books and reading, is that the Unions were far from perfect; the closed shop policies were *disgusting* to me, as were the non-secret ballots and pressure caused by thugs of the Union bosses to make their members vote in their way.

Now this isn't an endorsement of Thatcher at all, personally I believe that the Unions had to be reformed but Thatcher did it in a terrible, screwed up way which messed up social cohesion for a long time, but this doesn't mean you should present your case as if it was some sort of idealised good v evil dichotomy; it wasn't from the things I've read.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well I think the Scandinavian-style thing is more social democracy than socialism (and there is a distinction).

Personally, I don't have a huge problem with central planning. I think in some things it is necessary (university funding, science funding, NHS funding, etc.) although obviously it is within reason.

I think a lot of the opposition to central planning is quite new (really since the Red Scare). Albert Einstein, for example, [supported central planning](http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/Einstein.htm): 

&gt;I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow-men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society.

Of course, people should have some degree of freedom. Being an optimist though, I do like the idea of central planning since it is the only way we will ever achieve anything close to the [Venus Project](http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/The%20Zeitgeist%20Movement.pdf).

I think you are right about the unions, they certainly weren't perfect. Many trade unions aren't even socialist (look at the ALF in the US that actively fought against the socialist party, etc.) I suppose the same problems arise in any position with so much power.

I find it funny that you use the example ""as were the non-secret ballots and pressure caused by thugs of the Union bosses to make their members vote in their way."" though, since this occurs in the House Of Commons all the time with the whips and no-one cares.

I also don't agree with what Thatcher did, but I do wonder how long we could have withstood from globalization, even without Thatcher. Ultimately the death of manufacturing and mining to automation and outsourcing were pretty inevitable, I think Thatcher made it a lot worse though by not investing in other industries (like science, etc.) that could have given us a solid economy like South Korea, etc.

So basically, I don't see what's inherently wrong with central planning, though I agree with you about the unions.",0,1277573387,null,0,false,0,c0syqfh,t3_cj9in,t1_c0syqfh,t1_c0syowp,null,1426357470,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Many of us who lived through those times, knew that the Unions needed reform, there was no argument. What we saw was a decimation of the UK by Thatcher policies, and many of us are beginning to see the same thing albeit un-union at this point. A few years into Thatcher so many people, especially in the north did and do think of Thatcher as evil, because of what she did to the country, something that is argued should be left to the past, but it cannot because Thatcherism is still having an effect of many communities even to this day.

River and Father Octavian kept intoning that there was something bad about her.  She killed a good man, etc.   When she said it would change everything in the Big Bang, it had a dark tone to it, not a happy tone. 

BUT!  The Doctor has extra knowledge that River does not.  HE KNOWS HOW SHE DIES.   So no matter how bad she thinks she is, and maybe doesn't feel like she deserves him or that she is constantly trying to redeem herself, she already has to him.  He can forgive any bad thing she's done, knowing that she sacrificed herself to save him and Donna and to bring over 4000 people back to life.  

He knows her soul more than she knows her own.  And he can never tell her why he knows or it would spoil it. 

And, perhaps one of the worst parts.. the Doctor never had a real chance to mourn her.  He barely knew her when she died.  He never knows when he sees her next if it could be the first and last time..

Roundabout the end of 4th doctor and into the 5th, it's shown there's a vast maze of corridors, many rooms, wardrobes, and I recall something about a swimming pool.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS

""The TARDIS interior has a vast number of rooms and corridors. The exact dimensions of the interior have not been specified, but apart from living quarters, the interior includes an ancillary power station disguised as an art gallery, a greenhouse, bathroom, a library with a swimming pool, a medical bay, and several brick-walled storage areas (The Invasion of Time, 1978). There is also a secondary control room with ornate wood panels.[4] Portions of the TARDIS can also be isolated or reconfigured; the Doctor was able to jettison 25% of the TARDIS's structure in Castrovalva to provide additional ""thrust"".""

Oh, here we go:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invasion_of_Time

""This story is one of the few to contain an extended sequence inside the TARDIS (1964's The Edge of Destruction notwithstanding). The majority of the final episode comprises a chase inside the TARDIS, which appears to have extensive brick-walled areas beyond the more familiar roundels-on-white look, plus the spa/pool area ('bathroom') and art gallery. The Doctor had been seen earlier in the season in an artist's smock, apparently 'redecorating'.""

true,jmk4422,silence,Silence,"&gt;I would have preferred a companion other than a human female in her twenties from twenty-first century england,

Truth: you will never see a full time companion who strays too far from this formula. The reason is simple: the companion's job, from a storytelling point of view, is to help the viewer relate to the Doctor. If the companion were, say, a 24th century American who the Brits can't relate to the companion is not doing his or her job. Why Brits only? Their taxes pay for the show. Finally, the good looking female? That's just ratings, man. Another formula might work, of course, but it would not be Doctor Who.

&gt;The main issue I had with it was that the sense of evil that was generated in the episode was unjustified by the forces generating the evil. For that episode to have occured, someone must have gone ""We keep trying to feed it our children, but it just wont eat them.""

Is that a typo? Because someone did say that, near the end of the episode. It was part of what Amy realize the truth of the situation: If you were very old, very kind, and the last of your kind, how could you bare to hear children crying? Remind you of anyone? :) *Loved that part.* One of the best episodes of the season. Loved it.

&gt;that person is vindicated plots are kind of stupid (I'm not sure if that makes sense)

It does, and I agree this wasn't the best of episodes, but it was still good Ol' Who. And loved seeing Winston Churchill; I liked that he and the Doctor are old friends.

&gt;I don't like River Song

I can see that if you don't like one of the main characters in an episode how you might think less of the episode. For me, I hated Runaway Bride because I **hated** Donna before her return in Partners in Crime. After that she was my favorite companion, hands down. Oh, and for the record, I love River and those two episodes.

&gt;Vampires in Venice

Eh, a mediocre episode at best, I agree. Probably my least favorite of an awesome season.

Well, I'm done with the point-by-point response. My overall response is that I think your obsession with not liking River and the Amy/Rory dynamic ruined things for you. That's too bad, because I love River and I bought into the Amy/Rory relationship. You're right that at first Amy wasn't sure about him anymore, but later she was committed. I think the show handled this gradual progression brilliantly, a lot better than a lot dramas made for adults do, actually. Her reaction to his death in Amy's Choice was amazing for me. That look in her eyes, the way she says to the Doctor, ""Save him... save him. You're the Doctor, that's what you do."" made me smell onions being sliced.

Remove the Doctor from the equation entirely, and the equation changes. You cannot assume that the same things would have happened without the Doctor's presence as happened with the Doctor's presence. So considering that the universe still existed without the Doctor's presence, you have to assume that most of the things that would have resulted in the destruction of the universe *with* the Doctor's presence were inadvertently caused by the Doctor's existence.

And then when the Doctor is brought *back* into existence, he saved the universe many times and there you go.

Of course, you also have to notice that in earlier episodes when something was removed from existence by the cracks they never existed but the things that happened with them around still happened.

Amazing. Especially that BBC intro parody of the guys doing each other on the rooftop. But they were spot on with showing how all Hollywood movies are essentially the same, with the same characters, same tropes, same stereotypes. Genius, and hilarious.

Sadly I found the Paedofinder General sketches get *very* old after the first couple.

The ""Cliff"" sketches (where the guy wanders home at night and gives his wife a long drawn-out story about why he's late, before succinctly telling her the truth) are also some of my personal favourites too. The way the whole show jumped from incredibly dark to upbeat and humorous was amazing, and sometimes a little jarring too.

I loved the intro, too - inbetween all the satirical stuff, the intro starts out with a guy in a suit looking through the window of a shop at a tie... and just before the end of the intro it flashes to the same guy with the tie tightly around his arm while he injects himself with a needle. Dark.

Was this an example of that?  I don't think so.  As many people have commented elsewhere (and here) prisons are designed to keep people in not out.  And assuming a deadlock seal is single-sided, it could be inward facing to keep The Doctor in.

That being said, I'm on your side with the continual happy ending problem.  I agree with your choice of Logopolis as an example, as well, but I think you missed the bigger issue.  The plot arcs used to cover 3 - 8 episodes, so when they ended you could have a positive ending, a negative ending, whatever you wanted and continue the show.  Now all the major plot arcs seem to be season length or more, forcing the powers that be to decide on _one_ outcome, happy or sad so to speak.  I think that's a much more serious issue with the series (that I still love to watch) that if resolved would allow greater freedom to do episodes where not everything works out happily in the end.

I need to be clear here, I don't think the current way of dealing with the unemployed, especially the long term unemployed, works. At all. But I don't think the answer is to just hand out higher benefits. We don't have a great deal of money atm (we're wasting it on things like an endless war in the middle east) so IMHO the money we do have should be targeted at encouraging the private sector to create new jobs, especially in the north of England where there is fuck all outside of the large cities (I spent nearly a year unemployed until I moved to the south east of England (to live with my Dad) and got work inside a month at twice the pay of the jobs I was going for up north).

I think the idea of your worst enemy in the entire universe being seen as an ally by everyone else, and that your companion who should know about them not knowing them is at least a compelling, but I do agree the episode really fell apart at the end. ""Ever fancy someone you know you shouldn't?""

&gt;Six.

I think this episode was just unnecessary. 

&gt; Amy's choice was meant to drive home this theme, by showing us that she would die for Rory, but it didn't work for me, because there was never any chance that Amy was really pregnant.

There never really was a chance of a cold burning star either. You've surely had dreams where ridiculous things were happening, but you thought they seemed perfectly normal. I guess I see where you're coming from; that for the sake of the show, it was impossible, but I like the idea of trying to get into the minds of the characters in this situation. The doctor suddenly realizing his dream world is absurd when he was like ""anything can happen!"" before and stuff.

&gt;Vincent and the Doctor was pretty good, but just felt really out of place considering what had just happened to rory. I think it would have been better if placed where the dalek episode was.

I liked it's placement as the doctor trying to make Amy as happy as possible when the most devastating thing had just happened to her but she was completely unaware. 

You might have the same problem I had with season 4. I really couldn't stand Donna. She never grew on me. If I warmed up to her, I'd probably hold a different opinion of the season than I do.

I agree with many of the points here. But there's been something that's been bugging me all the time.

The continuity. The writing. Before, it was just between the series, Davies not bothering to look at the stuff between the series, not giving us a proper link to the movie.

But now?

I mean, did [Amy *pull* the Doctor out from beyond the cracks, or did she generate a whole new Doctor](/spoiler)?

If [Rory was re-created with the new universe, where did he get his memories back from](/spoiler)?

Whether [Amy recreated the Doctor or just retrieved him](/spoiler), why would he [not have been re-created along with the whole new universe, meaning there were **two** of him](/spoiler)?

And **even if** [the universe was recreated without the Doctor](/spoiler), then how would [River have still had the diary, empty or not](/spoiler)? How, for that matter, would [the re-created universe have survived at all, seeing as the Doctor has saved the universe ***how*** many times now?](/spoiler)?

And if [the universe **did** survive without the Doctor, then **how** would he have been remembered by somebody who wanted to call him for help for the next Christmas special](/spoiler)?

What about *little* things? Why the [Blinovitch energy between screwdrivers, but not between Amy-instances? Sure, the Doctor ones have been explained away before, but...](/spoiler)

I so desperately hoped that Moffat would've brought back more consistency in the writing. I wanted an excuse to go online and buy the new screwdriver and then round out the collection.

I like the new Doctor even more than Tennant; possibly more than Eccleston. I'll see whether I like him ultimately more than [Sylvester McCoy](/spoiler). I like Amy and River and I very much like Rory.

... I wanted to do a Narrative Chart for this episode (a la [Xkcd's](http://xkcd.com/657/))... but watching the consistency fall to pieces is just starting to kill me.

Been a fan non-stop for thirty years. Had an argument in USENET with fan semi-pro author Kate Orman because she thought it was fine to throw away continuity for a ""moving"" story, regardless of how much back-material there was to frame even **better** stories.

But it really seems as if (most) everybody just loves the little tear-jerker stories, rather than wanting to see a far more epic storyline with a **forty-seven** year history.

I don't *yet* think I'm so far gone as to sell the collection and give up. But it would be **so** much *more grand* to see this ""superb series"" become **even more** superb to become ***grand*** stories.

I can see the possible massive-scale epics. Turning around and seeing the [mish-mash](/spoiler) that happened instead... it's just depressing.

Sorry for the daily downer. Just had to get it out. Everyone else's individual ""but wasn't this great"" is true. Absolutely. But can you imagine pulling it all together into something *coherently perfect*? Can you **imagine** what that would be like?

*F\*ck* the ""Star Trek"" reboot or the BSG re-imagining. This could have been one perfectly coherent **forty-seven year show**. I weep.",0,1277694106,null,0,true,0,c0t25v2,t3_cjlw9,t1_c0t25v2,t3_cjlw9,null,1426359127,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

* Amy ""remembered"" the Doctor which in the context of what she did is vague on whether or not she re-created him or if he was pulled back. I suspect the former, as it was what happened with everything else.

* As to why there are remnants of his memory, it's just like everything else that got erased with a crack: parts of it remain. Half-eaten meal, an engagement ring, a blank diary, a house larger than it should be. The whole series was talking about memories and how important they are and how they're more powerful than you think. This is the end result. ""If something can be remembered, then it can return.""

* Shorting out the time differential between incarnations caused the 5th Doctor to look older than he should have. So there was a consequence (which was also convenient plot-wise to explain Davidson's age.) The two screwdrivers did spark, but they also directly touched each other. Amy touched Amelia's coat, which might not count. And anyway, she was an *alternate* Amelia which might play by different rules anyway.

* As far as the Doctor being or not being recreated in the Universe when Amy initially brought it all back, I think he was there... but redacted. The way the effects of Rory's actions in the 11th Hour weren't gone, just forgotten. And when he was remembered, he filled in the blanks; he filled the diary.

I don't think it's so far-gone from a 47 year cogent storyline. Most of what you mentioned is explicable. True they didn't lampshade, but I think they also needed to cram a LOT into this last episode. For the most part, and with just a with a dab of plot-spackle, they've done it admirably.

He gave what I consider to be flat performances, very much acting by the numbers, nothing special. I don't think he can do comedy, either.

When DT started in Doctor Who, I gave him the benefit of the doubt, but found his performances to be lacking. His manic energy, grinning, gurning that alternating with angry, sad and shouted exclamations just did nothing for me.

THe quality of material from NuWho S3 rapidly declined in quality and DT wasn't enough of an actor to save it. In every episode he seemed to do the usual range of manic, angry, sad; and he did just that week after week. The final three specials in 2009 where of questionable quality, and DT's exaggerated mannerisms grew worse and worse.

true,ruaidhri,mcgann,McGann,"&gt;How, for that matter, would the re-created universe have survived at all, seeing as the Doctor has saved the universe how many times now??

The way I see it, the cracks in time don't instantaneously cause every trace of a person to disappear. I think this is how Amy was able to exist even though her younger self had been erased. Had The Doctor not rebooted the universe, Amy would eventually have been erased.  I think

&gt;why would he not have been re-created along with the whole new universe, meaning there were two of him?

The Doctor was inside the exploding TARDIS when it rebooted the universe. Essentially this meant he would be put on the other side of the Universe as it was being re-created, meaning he was erased from history, until Amy's memory brought him back.

&gt;If Rory was re-created with the new universe, where did he get his memories back from?

Seems to be one of the effects of being a time-traveller. You remember things that happened and also things that didn't happen at the same time. Kind of a particle/wave duality thing, except for wrapped up in a timey-wimey memory. 

&gt;But can you imagine pulling it all together into something coherently perfect?

I actually think it was all perfectly coherent. You have to accept the premise that a)time can be rewritten, b)memories are more powerful then we think and c) memories can be used in certain special circumstances (like having lived with a crack in the universe in your bedroom for years) to rewrite time.

Completely agree here, capitalism is a flawed system of boom and bust, anything that grows in a system of greed will always flop at some point.

Ivaskin:  Saying Marxism is discredited as Capitalism is crap.  Socialism/Socially conscious systems is the only way to form a balanced and more fair society, because we all need to work together to make things work. Constant rewarding with greater wealth does nothing for society besides benefit the few.  Also the gap will ALWAYS grow if capitalism carries on the way its going, because it benefits the rich to have a poorer class.. Less to pay for more goods.

What surprises me the most was hearing how the German's dealt with the whole recession/credit crunch etc.  Hardly any works where laid off and the companies that employed them was subsidised by to keep there workers on, now once the credit crunch (What ever) has passed then the full Germany work force is ready for action, not like here in the UK where we consider it a great idea to Sack a whole load of the population and then decide, shit we need to try up a load of people to get our factories etc working again..

true,ruaidhri,mcgann,McGann,"b) The Doctor explains the Nestene Consciousness got more then it bargained for when it used Amy's memories. It also (accidently it seems) created a copy of Rory. The Doctor even says they got Rory's soul. I assumed while watching it this was because of Amy being special, with regard to having grown up with the crack in the universe pouring everything into her head. Presumably Amy could have gotten Rory to return as a human, but due to the Nestene and Dalek interference he returned as Rory, but in an Auton body. But it was Rory.

Rory did not get his memories back until after Amy remembers and the Tardis reappears. Amy's remembering brings back the Doctor and Rory's memory- and as the Auton Rory was Rory she had restored (albeit accidently and in a plastic body) with the help of the nestene consciousness, Rory remembers his life as Auton. Essentially he remembered the other timeline where his 'soul' (I don't believe in souls, but an exact duplicate of your consciousness and memories is to all intents and purposes a soul) just happened to be in the body of an Auton for 2,000 years. 

As a rough guide to the timeline of the Doctor's non-existance/existance. 

When he talks to the sleeping 7 year old Amelia Pond he exists (as he did when he spoke, later in Amy's timeline and earlier in his when he talked to her in the Forest of the Byzantium. I thought it was quite neat how he couldn't tell her what exactly to remember what he told her when she was 7, as from his point of view he hadn't actually said it yet!). 

On Amy's wedding morning, when she's woken up by her mother, The Doctor does not exist, but traces of him do remain. The cracks don't wipe you out instaneously-the erase bits of space/time in a very piecemeal fashion. Hence why Amy was able to exist even though her younger self had been erased. That's also why I think the Earth was still standing and not under Dalek or Cybermen rule...the cracks hadn't yet gotten around to eradicating the deeds of the Doctor. First to go was the memory of the Doctor. If Amy hadn't been able to recall him, then I think the timelines would have shifted again to a world where all the good the Doctor had done, had never happened (like Turn Left). 

I presume the same thing was happening to River. Presumably as....whatever she is to the Doctor...she has several memories worth of him, including the Diaries, but they are slowly fading away. It isn't pointed out what time the River we see at the wedding is from, but my guess is she arrives from some future point in time, knowing that Amy will need a nudge to remember the Doctor and restore him proper to the Universe. Presumably because at some stage Amy or the Doctor tell her this. This could be a timey wimey thing but I like it as it's so similar to how the Doctor and River meet in the Library.

**tl;dr:** The cracks in time don't operate in a linear casuality and they don't instaneously remove all traces of someone from the Universe. Because of this and Amy's restorative memory power due to living with the crack for so long, it was possible for the Doctor to come back and for Rory to remember being an Auton....

...well it makes perfect sense to me. Of course I had a horrible series of dreams last night in which everything occured out of order, in a time travel/time-loop kind of way, but that's what I get for listening to Doctor Who audio dramas while drifting off to sleep.

The original series hardly ever had time travel, and the tardis was an excuse for having the show set on different planets and times, rather than being an actual character.

Then as soon as the new series makes time travel an integral part of the plot, Bill and Ted show up to teach the doctor that the way to escape a trap is to let yourself out so that you can go back in time to let yourself out.

The people who suggested the doctor would escape by escaping then going back in time to leave himself a sonic screwdriver so he could escape turned out to be on the right track. And Russell T Davies is more subtle than Steven Moffat. How's that for irony?

""Coherent perfection"" is an impossibility when retcons can literally happen as part of the plot, unless you accept the fact that the disruptions in continuity are an integral part of Doctor Who's coherence.  

RTD would not have been able to successfully resurrect the show had he been beholden to four decades of previous continuity, but rather than pretend it never happened he used the Last Great Time War to sweep all of it under the rug.  It's all still there waiting to be uncovered, and occasionally the old continuity will simply erupt as it did with the Daleks/Cybermen or Rassilon and the Time Lords.  

This was nothing short of brilliant IMHO.  I loves me some continuity (I've also watched the show since the 80's), but you weren't going to hook an entire generation of new viewers by ramming all if it down their throats at once.  That they found a way to ""reboot"" the show in a manner that clears the deck while at the same time allowing for anything that has gone before to show up again is the key to Doctor Who's enduring success.

I have heard others voice the same opinion, and I also agree (and I feel I speak with some knowledge - I know several of the writers personally) that this is because when RTD was producing, he used his writers as ""first draft"" material, and essentially rewrote the stories himself. This resulted in a more cohesive ""feel"" and voice for the series as a whole, and they stand together as a whole as opposed to individual stories, in essence, the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.

Moffat, OTOH, has let his writers' work stand largely untampered-with. This makes writers happy, but results in a show that doesn't ""hang together"" as well. Characters feel and act differently from episode to episode, and there's not as much sense of unity.

Add to this the fact that the BBC is mercilessly cutting budget on a flagship show (I can't have been the only person who noticed the ""setty"" look this year) which makes the whole thing look cheap.

Another thing I hate is the fact that fans are so reluctant to criticize the show, like, if they dare to voice that something isn't ""11.5 out of 10"" when it clearly isn't (New Series section oxygen thieves on GB, yes I AM looking at you).

My problem there is that's pretty much a paraphrasing of what Kate Orman told me years ago - *i.e.*, it really still means they'll ignore whatever bits they like.

&gt; Which, if you think about it, is inevitable for a show that is about time travel. ""Coherent perfection"" is an impossibility when retcons can literally happen as part of the plot, unless you accept the fact that the disruptions in continuity are an integral part of Doctor Who's coherence.

No, not at all. Just because it's a show about time travel means absolutely nothing for one single reason: *the show is still seen from the perspective of the Doctor*. The **Doctor's** continuity has to remain; when it *doesn't*, we see it clearly happen on screen.

The only participant in all of this whose continuity should be more constant than the Doctor's is ***us***.

&gt; RTD would not have been able to successfully resurrect the show had he been beholden to four decades of previous continuity

That's the same kind of thing Orman said. Rather than seeing it as a base from which to build better stories, they saw it as a *millstone*.

What *real* improvements have been made by the new series that couldn'tve been done by **not**-trashing on the continuity?

Hoorah, there's been a Time War. There was a massive Time War in the BBC Novels after-the-movie and before-the-new-series as well. Why was **it** retconned to be about Daleks instead? What improvement has really been made by throwing it all out?

&gt; you weren't going to hook an entire generation of new viewers by ramming all if it down their throats at once

And I'm not asking anyone to take such a ramming. Bring it out gradually, by all means. But there's still no excuse for micturating all over the old stuff. What if somebody gets the bug from the new series and decides to hunt down the old novels?

They'll pull out something like ""The Gallifrey Chronicles"" and go ""WTF? Gallifrey was destroyed by the Daleks; who the hell is this 'Faction Paradox'? Where are the Daleks in this? What's this about jumping into a volcano? Where's the regeneration scene? What is this bull!?""

&gt; they found a way to ""reboot"" the show in a manner that clears the deck

How old is the Doctor?

&gt; again is the key to Doctor Who's enduring success

true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't think I'd much mind it involving the Doctor Who universe, but they'll just royally fuck it up if the make it actually *about* the Doctor because there's three ways I see it going:

- This is the Doctor's final regeneration, and while it doesn't necessitate Matt Smith calling it quits just yet, it would spoil the surprise if Smith doesn't quit until (say) 2 years after the film is released.  Also, the final regeneration would be one film?  Not likely...

- I can't imagine the BBC would give up rights to the **final regeneration**.  It's a flagship show!  So, *Parallel universe Doctors?* (not a fan of the idea, but if anyone does it I'd prefer Davies.  Writers in Hollywood can only do so much though before Hollywood fucks up the rest)

- This is the retelling of an already existing Doctor, and thus a reboot (a remake would have to be a series since it would follow the same story and need more time than a film).  I'd sort of like to see a remake or even rebooting of the old Doctors, but I'm not sure an film version would be the best idea.  Even if each film is another regeneration.

And some objections I have to the current plans:

- Depp is so generic weird now, it would completely detract from the rest of the film because everyone sees him now as 'Johnny Depp' and they wouldn't see 'The Doctor'.

- The actor who plays the Doctor has to grow on you over time.  Depp is too busy to commit to the role long enough for him to grow on you like most previous Doctors.

- Please not an American version...I have to wonder what Davies is up to though; originally Tennant wanted to be a Scot, but apparently Davies vetoed him using his native accent, saying he didn't want the Doctor to be anything other than British.  Apparently there's a bit of a precedence after 10 regenerations...I wish that sentiment would apply to the rest of the writing/cast/crew, etc.

- They'll mass market it to a wider audience.  If they have Depp confirmed they'll almost certainly do this (and already have just by hiring him, IMO).  Mass marketing isn't *always* that bad, but it usually throws a fresh coat of paint over the small details that existing fans love.

**EDIT** Okay so my intuition tells me it's either about him getting the TARDIS as a young Hartnell, a parallel universe Doctor, or a follow-up to the end of the 12th doctor if he gets more regenerations and a lead-in to the 13th, though I think the first or second would be more likely: coordinating the movie and the series would be difficult as hell.",0,1277862608,null,0,true,0,c0t6kvj,t3_ckckv,t1_c0t6kvj,t3_ckckv,null,1426361202,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

This wasn't some JJ Abrams-style reboot- Davies and Moffat have been huge Doctor Who fans since childhood and have nothing but the utmost respect for the show.  As much as I loved the original show, if the new version had been nothing but a connect-the-dots fanwank it wouldn't have lasted past Series One.  

I still contend that you are fatally misreading the treatment of continuity.  At no point has the new iteration of show denied anything that has gone before.  While the invocation of the Last Great Time War (again, no one has said that there weren't other time wars, merely that when we meet Doctor #9 it is in the immediate aftermath of the last one) allows the show's writers to selectively engage the Doctor's past, nowhere is it suggested that from the Doctor's point of view these events didn't happen- even if the Doctor now exists in a universe where these events never in fact happened.  

This ""massive disconnect"" is not a weakness of the new version of the show, but its strength.  Don't you get it?  The existing continuity wasn't simply waved away by the writers- the Doctor sacrificed his own continuity in order to end the Last Great Time War.  The Doctor feels this discontinuity profoundly, as it represents everything that he has lost.  This was to me an extremely clever way to address the issue, but your mileage may vary (as clearly it does here).

You're still not getting it. I never asked for a ""connect-the-dots fanwank"". Why do people keep taking the argument to a falsely-exaggerated degree?

I just would have appreciated **not contradicting** previous continuity.

Or, in order to appease **everyone** - just some throwaway lines **bridging** the continuities. Wouldn't **that** have been ideal?

&gt; At no point has the new iteration of show denied anything that has gone before.

- How old is the Doctor?  
- Who was the first Doctor Sarah met after the Fifth?  
- Which Doctor took on the role of teacher John Smith and who was the assistant?  
- Where did the Doctor gain the ability to regrow body parts?  
- Does the Doctor have: a direct family with parents, born as children; a family of ""cousins"" where he was loomed / born an adult; or was he born into a group creche with the sign of ""crossed computers"" as their heraldic insignia?  

&gt; again, no one has said that there weren't other time wars

In the between-series Time War, Gallifrey was destroyed. While the Doctor faced Grandfather Paradox. **By** the Doctor; who then spent *the next hundred years* wandering the Earth as an amnesiac. And right up until the Eighth Doctor's last adventure, the Time Lords were never recovered.

&gt; This ""massive disconnect"" is not a weakness of the new version of the show, but its strength. Don't you get it?

I get you're saying this. I get your claim. *It just doesn't hold up*. It's *wrong*.

&gt; the Doctor sacrificed his own continuity in order to end the Last Great Time War. The Doctor feels this discontinuity profoundly, as it represents everything that he has lost.

Even gets to make fun of itself in that manner (joking on the royal family, prudishness of Brits and other stereotypes).  They've been trying for decades to find a suitable transfer to an American audience which I don't understand, the show is fine as it is.  Broadcast it in America and people will watch it.  BBC America is shuttled out of the way too often and commercials are awkward to the point where I can barely stand to watch it.  Torchwood was successful and is now jumping the pond without change other than geographical, maybe they'll learn something from that.  Sorry, rant :(

And I like Johnny Depp, but I like him less and less every time they shoehorn him into a role.  Bridging the marketing would be horrible as well.  The Doctor Who brand can't stand alone in an American market apparently so they would have to advertise Depp which would wholly ruin the character and story. Why not do a Tennant 1-off that happened in one of the companion gaps like the Titanic episode.  Plenty of thrill there.  On the whole though, I would prefer Doctor Who to stay British 100%.

This whole article pisses me off. First off, statistics are not an indicator of artistic merit. Secondly bad data is not an indicator of popularity. This is the first article since the finale that I see posted here with an opportunity to address the artistic merit of one of the most interesting seasons of doctor who since watching the 5th-6th-7th doctors in the eighties. (I think this season really felt like one of the 4th or 5th doctors in terms of overall ambience.) 

It doesn't discuss the season or has any valid criticism, it doesn't talk about Smith except saying he's well-received by critics in a way that implies ""the public have got it wrong but have made their call now, case closed"". Its sole purpose seems to be a cheeky jab at Matt Smith and their overall efforts this season. 
Basically the article is this: 

* Question the quality of Doctor Who without Tennant. 
* We have this bad data to validate our implication that Matt Smith is no Tennant, but it's bad data and we're going to do our best to ignore circumstance. 
* Matt Smith is good, but he's not Tennant, is he? 

No he's not, he's the Doctor. It's a bad article.

Edit:
&gt; one of the most interesting seasons of doctor who since watching the 5th-6th-7th doctors in the eighties.

This is hyperbole. Of course the bad-ass doctor idea was brilliant with the 9th and 10th doctors. I mean that this season is interesting in that it's the season that has most deviated from it's prior.

&gt;Again, I ask you what the threshold for project size/budget should be? Can we only cut government spending projects that are £1bn at least?

There is no such threshold worth considering, but you seem to be under the impression that there is some sort of ‘Homeopathy project - £4m’ that can jus be cancelled with the mark of a red pen.

That’s not how it works. There might be the odd project set up to study it directly, but most of that ‘suspected’ amount will fall under the umbrella of other projects or budgets set up with a much wider focus. You could turn around tomorrow and say ‘No more money goes to Homeopathy!’ and save no money for it; the project managers would simply divert the funds they’d have spent there else ware (the NHS is one big sponge when it comes to loose capital).

You could try pulling out all the homeopathy funding like picking out stitch-work, but then chances are a whole load of this sort of stuff is going to be cancelled anyway when budgets start to get squeezed, so why bother?

I loved RTD's run, but there were times where the emotional gravitas, given it's context, prevented my suspension of disbelief. This season, I REALLY felt like it was proper Dr. Who, back in his groove, especially during the Angels, Vampires, Dreamlord and the Lodger episodes. It didn't feel like ""Lets do Dr. Who but make him hollywood-badass"", which is blatantly what RTD was going for, right from the outset.

Exactly. It should be cut because it is a waste of taxpayer money no matter how much it is.

&gt;It is small-fry compared to say, the bill for woefully ineffective cancer drugs

Which drugs? Can you point to studys determining how effective they are and why they are not cost effective?

&gt;the billions of pounds that have been wasted on the new NHS IT system due to poor management and planning.

I agree, that should never have been put in place considering how awful it was planned and executed.

&gt;there is some sort of ‘Homeopathy project - £4m’ that can jus be cancelled with the mark of a red pen.

£4m is spent on homeopathy - there must be a list of the things that make that up: take the list and cancel every line item on it.

&gt;the project managers would simply divert the funds they’d have spent there else ware

Good - it can go to any number of worthwhile projects.

&gt;(the NHS is one big sponge when it comes to loose capital).

I do not agree with the conservative position that NHS spending should be ringfenced - considering the size of the organisation there is no doubt many different areas that could be looked at for money savings.

&gt;but then chances are a whole load of this sort of stuff is going to be cancelled anyway when budgets start to get squeezed, so why bother?

Because it is currently wasting £4m for a scientifically unsound 'service' better served by the private sector.

What we are talking about is the Kremlin. When Putin (ex-KGB and FSB) got into power, it was with the backing of the security forces, being the military, the KGB and the FSB. Under Yeltsin, the security services  felt neglected, a joke. Under Putin they gained power and certain incidents happened that were very convenient.

At the same time Putin's entourage are hopeless about any kind of free market economy. They know that communism doesn't work but they don't trust capitalism either and fundamentally don't understand it (except through what they steal). This is where Medvedev comes in. An old associate of Putin, but he does have some idea of what is needed for a free market. He is for freeing things up but very carefully (remember, he is a friend of Putin). However Medvedev does represent some of the economic advisors who have been becoming increasingly frustrated at Russia's lack of progress.

You come home one night to find an apple on your table that you don't remember putting there.

This is not mandatory, as the apple's appearance has already happened in your past, and its cause has already yielded its effect, so any number of things could have caused the apple to be there. Maybe your mom left it there, or maybe you waited five years, and travelled back to that point then to leave yourself an apple. You would never know the original cause, had you decided to not do anything about it.

However, the Doctor does know the cause of his escape - Rory witnesses him traveling back in time with the fez and mop. Therefore, he feels compelled to later use the vortex manipulator to replicate that event in his own past. BUT, since the event has already happened in his timeline, he doesn't technically have to perpetuate the causality loop; he can go on with his life, still free from the Pandorica.

As Moffat described though, ""the gloves are off"", and the Doctor is in full on paradox mode. By it's very nature, time-travel is paradox inducing, and it's seen often enough in DW anyway.

Imagine Series 4, the Doctor and Donna go back in time and cause Pompeii to be devastated, but Donna may not have been born unless Vesuvius erupted (butterfly effect etc), so she was responsible for her own creation. If it hadn't exploded, events may not have aligned to her ancestors even existing!

Anytime the Doctor goes back in time it is paradoxical for those he takes with him, and for himself, as much as going forward in time is for those he meets there.

The only thing that slightly scares me is that BBC has a development deal with ABC, who is owned by Disney.   For example, at the start of Dancing with the Stars, they show the BBC Logo but say it's an ABC studio production. 

Depp does have a deal to do Disney films, as evidenced by Pirates and Alice in Wonderland, so from that point of view, it is conceivable.  

However, I can't imagine them confirming it with some unknown Web site and not making a huge announcement.  And I can't imagine RTD would let them do such a thing.

One thing I didn't like is how they revived Amy. I understand the Pandorica needed an imprint of her living DNA, but why didn't they use the same trick, a revived Amy comes back to revive Amy. I guess since there was another way of getting an Amy to touch it, but just odd I suppose.

Doctor Who's time travel rules have always been a bit weird, and its always easy to find paradox's and plot holes in anything involving time travel. The Doctor never magically freed himself, you have to stop thinking that there had to be a first time which started this cycle of being imprisoned then being freed, the freeing himself. There is no first kink in this chain, its just a loop.

I personally loved that they did something mind warpy like this. Amelia's thirsty because the Doctor took her drink, causing her to be thirsty. So much fun. :]

true,crystallized,k9,K-9,"I thought the writing through the whole series was some of the best of NewWho.  I don't remember ever finishing up any episode from the previous four with such a long list of awesome moments and quotes.  Matt Smith and Karen Gillan seem to have such amazing timing and play off each other so well.  Alex Kingston and Arthur Darvill are so incredible as well, and all four of them have such an amazing Team TARDIS dynamic.  I've always preferred when the Doctor has more than one Companion, and I would love to see all four of them in the TARDIS consistently.  The series was so funny and so brilliant and so emotional all at the same time; it was just a great experience.

The thing I loved most about The Big Bang was that the *deus ex machina*-like element - if we remember the Doctor he can come back - has been set up and mentioned over tons of episodes.  I hear a lot of people comparing it to the moment at the end of series three where everyone saying the Doctor's name revives him.  There was absolutely no setup for that to happen, no real attention paid to the Archangel network in S3 before that.  SFnarg, in at least five episodes that I can remember, emphasized the importance of memories and remembering and ""You have to remember.""  I didn't feel cheated because I knew that memories were going to be so important.  Everything in Series Fnarg was incredibly well planned out from start to finish and I love that.

I realized after I finished watching Big Bang that this is going to be the first Christmas special that isn't dealing with either the new Doctor or the loss of his Companion, and I'm really interested in seeing how that plays out.

What actually happened was Bill &amp; Ted's phone box sounds a lot like a Tardis, and they dropped by to leave a few hints on how to escape from a trap then go back and set up what you needed for the escape.

Then something happened-- I started softening to them. Matt Smith's frenetic energy really won me over and I fell in love with Eleven, his manic side, his sort arrogant wit, etc. And 'Amy's Choice' made me see Amy in a different way, too. 

Long story short, I was absolutely awe struck by the time 'The Pandorica Opens' aired. The storytelling skill, the subtlety in emotion, and the grace with which it all came together just blew me a way. I have always been and will always be a huge fan of RTD's time with the show, and I champion his four years for laying an excellent foundation for Moffat to jump off, and I'm excited to see the fairy tale elements that Moffat has begun to bring to the series.
