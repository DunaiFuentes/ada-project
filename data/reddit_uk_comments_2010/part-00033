Pros: Strong as an ox, good air-power, a completely different sort of striker than anything that has been employed at the club for the last decade. The exact opposite of Torres. 

Cons: Old man (31), somewhat prone to injury.

Still, if he could be signed for £6-8M or some sort of swap-deal for dead weight, we would have a cynical, old striker that should see us through the next couple of seasons as a supplement to Torres.

I used to live in student accommodation (infact, three over my university years) and met _many_ art students and other, what I call, 'those' degrees. Sure they are fun but 99% of them won't be paying any bills in the future.

Not a single person I met has a job even remotely related to art, drama or any of 'those' degree. Most are working the same jobs they would work if they hadn't bothered going to university(or no work at all) and only succeeded in burying themselves in debt. Now, of course, you get many experiences in university but some of my friends who didn't bother going to university still got the 'experience' of sorts because they would always hang out with us etc - so they didn't really lose out.

So trying to save money and avoid criticism (or even having their budgets trimmed) local councils cut back and cut back on the ""standing"" snow countermeasures and spent the money on other things... and then the first big snowfall of the year takes everyone by surprise and they have to scramble to get snowploughs and salt out on the roads... and everyone criticises them ""for not being able to handle a little snow"".

In you think back, it's generally only really the *first* day or two of heavy snowfall each year that really fouls everything up (ignoring the railways, which at the best of times can be fucked up with a *dirty look*) - after that councils get their snow contingencies in place and things generally work relatively well.

TL;DR: If they're too prepared and nothing happens, people call them profligate and criticise them.  If they aren't prepared enough, people criticise them for the start-up time required to *get* prepared.

Yes, but you still need somewhere to store it... plus vehicles to distribute it, and those vehicles and snowploughs need to be serviced and maintained... and you need to pay people to be on-call each evening to *drive* those gritter lorries and snowploughs if it snows, plus managers/schedulers/planners to tell them where to drive to and which streets to grit/plough first, etc, etc, etc.

The point is that it costs money to maintain preparedness, and if you spend money to remain prepared and nothing happens, people (by which I mean the media and opposition political candidates) short-sightedly criticise the decision-maker(s) for wasting money.

The trouble is that people are extremely bad at differentiating between ""a waste"" and ""essential, important readiness for a contingency that just, in retrospect, didn't turn out to be needed on this *particular* occasion"".

**Most students pick these courses because they can't be bothered going into the working world. They pick the low hanging fruit from the tree.**

However, I do agree people like you described exist. You find them in a lot of degree courses in fact. You will also find many students attending university just because their friends plan on and are worried they will miss out and be excluded from future university related activities.

I have been highly involved with the British arts council among many other organisations and still do on a weekly basis (purely on technical issues, computing related) so I am well aware of these roles. But honestly, its mostly common sense and filled with people piping up in meetings to purely making themselves feel and look important and tell everyone they have a view and *look at me*. It takes no degree to pipe up an opinion.

I don't want to scare you, really I don't, but these organisations are *always* late paying their bills because the cash flow is so poor. In fact, only last week a round of work has been cancelled because the funding just doesn't exist. Not only that - many of the staff work for a pittance. If you want to know further details of my involvement I'll explain via PM.

I *strongly* disagree with your last statement if your logic is 'you must attend university for these skills' (I might be wrong). Many of those skills can be self taught and often the best are just that - self taught.

It's just been drummed into people so much that speeding is the be all and end all of road safety.  That's rubbish.  But there's a lot of money at stake making more and more snooping equipment. 

Most people will drive above the speed limits, because the road and all the conditions allow them to, quite safely.  Sure a few morons will hammer through, but they do that anyway, they just slowed down when their sat nav warned them there's a camera.

I welcome more Police on the road, rather than cameras.  Catch people driving poorly, not just punishing those that stray a few MPH over the limit.",0,1290619514,null,0,true,0,c16ra9m,t3_eb2cr,t1_c16ra9m,t1_c16qkd8,null,1426592244,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Labour were running up deficits long before the crunch hit. Nothing at all to do with bailing out any banks. They were wasting money in all directions. White elephants like ID cards, lots of failed IT projects, throwing money at the NHS (with little to no improvement), Iraq/Afghanistan, etc.

The bank bailouts (in which we took significant shareholdings in the banks) are not an issue - as those are temporary and (providing Gordon Brown isn't orchestrating the selloff - he didn't do a good job on our gold reserves) once the economic conditions are right, we'll profit from an increased share price.

The deficits are not due to bank bailouts, they are due to the former. These need to be eradicated, and then finally we can try paying down the debt (again, not the bank bailouts).

It is also Labour that engineered the conditions that allowed the banking system to do what it did. What other parties may have done is not relevant; Labour had their hands on the levers of power when all this happened. If the Conservatives were in power, they would be equally criticised (by me, at least). But they weren't. Labour deserve all the blame.

I've never heard a chav in the shops after one of them screams at the other that their kid is being a little fucker ""I understand. They're buggers, and you're really stressed. Let me take care of them, and when we get home you have a good lie down, you 're tired and irritable.""

""Ok honey, thanks!""

Nooo, instead...

""Stop fukin wingeing at me ya bastard, I didn't want no kid anyway. I'm fucking off to the pub. It's your problem, you deal wiv it.""

It **feels** like it's self-inflicted... but how can it be? Surely they'd improve their own situation if they knew how to handle people, children, and problems?

I think that's why people enjoy watching the shows so much - it looks like it's all self-inflicted due to being selfish emotionally, with time, with money, with help...

The relationships that work tend to have both partners *giving*, and the other making an effort to *not* ask for help.

Although I agree it's never fun to see such a large chunk of your wages taken every month, because it's applied in bands based on your income, it's actually a relatively fair way for the government to collect the money to provide those services. Those that can afford it pay more, and those that can't pay less. I don't think that's unreasonable.

The way it's applied means that, for example, if you earn more than ~£37k (the 40% income tax rate threshold), it's only applied to earnings *above* that threshold, so rich people still get the same benefits of reduced tax that poor people get for everything below that (and no tax on everything below ~£6k). Which seems like a good way to take more money from people who can afford it without unfairly penalising them just for earning more.

In the UK its not common to have snow every year without fail - sometimes you can see 5 / 10 years drift by with perhaps a few non event snowflakes at most. Quite often the Met office will also get it wrong, so its a difficult one to budget for.

If a local council spends X amounts of £'s (which is normally 5 figures an up)  on salt reserves, gritter lorries and snow ploughs etc and then no snow turns up and we have a mild winter they would get ripped in the media in the same way as they get ripped for being unprepared.

The same goes for People. Norwegians know from tradition that it's best to get off your ass and shovel the ice off the pavement so the kids can get to school and granny can get to the shops. In the UK we look out the net curtains and huff and puff about why the council have not shown up yet.

The Bierkeller's metal night is on Fridays, and they tend to book metal bands.  The Fleece is also good for the harder end of rock.

There are some so-pop-it's-painful places like Oceana and Panache (which sports a cheesy music night).

Places like Start The Bus and Mr Wolf's are good for bands.

true,Haiku_attack,null,null," So you're saying we should just wait for people to become entrepreneurs? When do we abolish tuition fees?
 Don't you think there'll be an economic impact from fewer people entering highly skilled jobs? 

 I'm not saying all entrepreneurs have to be graduates, but it depends on what they do. In order to come up with a lot of ideas, you have to know about things.  Are all of these people going to be creating simple products which require no training to design and produce? 
 Surely a huge number of them are engineers, chemists or designers.
Even if the basic maths isn't a problem, then there are a wealth of other skills that may be required.  

 I'm not saying we don't need more of them, I'm saying I don't see it as a viable solution. It's taking a tiny minority of people, then selecting a specific section of them and saying ""these people are a viable model for many others"". 
  Very few people are successful entrepreneurs, while a lot more people show a direct benefit from having a higher education. 
 
 My point earlier, was that directly producing something, or generating income is not the only thing we need. We need research to keep us competitive. We need research if we want to produce things.

About your original point that people can work to fund their education.
 The proposed raise in fees is going to make tuition alone about £30,000. There simply aren't a lot of £30,000 jobs sitting around for 18 year olds to claim. If there was, then unemployment wouldn't be much of an issue. And even if there was, that's still two or three years of working full time to afford tuition for a normal degree. How many jobs paying that much would favour an applicant who is likely to leave after 2 years?
 I walked out of college in 2007 and was lucky enough to have good qualifications along with a variety of practical skills (second language, high literacy/numeracy, advanced computer skills) and I got a job paying £6 an hour. I was considered incredibly lucky by those around me. 
 Part time work: It's great if you can get it, but it's not always available and your course timetable may not allow it. I work 9-5 on my course, and my workload is comparatively light. I'm still waiting on approval to begin my dissertation, which will increase that by a huge amount.

dyslexia is based around the mental processing of how language is spelled, often leading to the uses of phonetic spelling as the mind directly processes spoken words and spells them as they sound.

key boards have no influence on spelling what so ever they are a method of input, if you mis-spell a word you just continue to mis-type them.

web browsers do have some spell checking built in but its far from perfect and often set to the US language and with a limited dictionary to back it up.

as for lazy, about the net and grammar Nazis yep as you don't matter in the big picture, in life NOPE heading for a 1/1 is far from lazy.

as for am i dyslexic, i most certainly am but i'm not a big headed knob that decides to judge anyone else who says they are.

because as a dyslexic i know it affects everyone who has it completely differently in many aspects of language and in the degree of how bad it is.

No-one's got any balls any more. In the 50s, if your grandparents or mine looked out of a window and there was snow, in ten minutes they'd be outside shovelling, making sure the driveway was clear. And while they were outside with the shovel, they'd probably do a good stretch of the path as well, just to do their bit.

Now (I blame TV and internet entirely), there's no sense of community. All of our news is world news, no-one cares about local news any more. You might know your next door neighbours, but do you know anyone in the houses beyond them? No-one says hello to each other any more. No-one even makes eye contact in case you get mugged for your wallet.

It's too easy now to look outside, see that it's snowed, ring work and say you're staying at home and sit and watch TV all day.

Jon Henley’s article in the Guardian is a corking [read](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/mar/16/john-lewis)

But it is a little overlong for my gen y attention span. In the spirit of comradely information dissemination please find below the crib notes.

[Rants added in by me are handily italicised to facilitate swift dismissal]

*John Spedan Lewis - JSL*

A radical born 1885 who believed “the present state of affairs is a perversion of the proper workings of capitalism"" it is ""wrong to have millionaires before you have ceased to have slums""; that ""the dividends paid to some shareholders"" for doing essentially nothing were obscene when ""workers earn hardly more than a bare living""; and that co-ownership and partnership, rather than exploitative employment, might be ""the new source of working energy of which our country is in such grave need"".

*What did JSL do with these crazy ideas I hear you ask?*

At the age of 21 he came to the realisation that he, his brother and his father were raking in a sum equal to the combined salaries of everyone else who worked for them. He was determined things should change.

In his own store he instituted shorter hours, longer holidays, and a dose of democracy. Within five years, he turned an annual loss of £8,000 into a profit of £20,000.

He then added a partial profit-sharing scheme and in 1928 a constitution and finally the John Lewis Partnership Limited. The ultimate step was an irrevocable trust settlement that turned ownership of the partnership – and a responsibility in the running of it – over to the people employed within it.

*This is not only a heart warming story of paternal economic philanthropy a la Joseph Rowntree and George Cadbury; men of privilege able to look beyond personal greed. (Note the Quaker connection)*

*It also provides an alternate vision for the way we work.*

*As a society the vast majority of people have looked on in mounting horror and confusion as the economic system we rely on melted down. The individuals, masters of the universe, tasked with understanding and predicting the system turned to us, the bystanders, to bail them out. Private profits; socialised losses.*

*As banks return to profit, bankers to bonuses and shareholders to portfolio growth and the people to paying off newly massive public debt, we are in danger of misplacing our outrage for want of an alternative vision.*

*This is why I think the JL business model is fascinating:*

The business model is more than simply sharing profits (Every employee received a ‘dividend’ of 16% of their annual salary this year). Each employee(partner) is asked to “play an active role as an owner"" to “engage with... colleagues and work with them in thinking through what will make the business successful. Therefore “shareholders aren't passive and distant."" Those opinions are voiced through democratic channels. The chairman and board run the company's commercial activities, but an 82-member partnership council elects nearly half the board (and in theory, can sack the chairman). And the Partnership council itself is largely elected through a network of forums representing every department of every JL branch and Waitrose supermarket.

*Does it Work?*

John Lewis in the depths of what everyone keeps telling us is the deepest financial and economic crisis since the second world war has enjoyed operating profit up 20%.

*Interesting but anecdotal. Hardly a compelling argument for restructuring an economic system...*

Employee-owned companies contribute £25bn to the British economy. According to an annual index they outperform the FTSE by roughly 10% each year. Research by the Cass Business School indicates that employee-owned businesses also create jobs faster; are significantly more resilient in an economic downturn; deliver far better customer satisfaction; boast substantially higher value added per employee; and, depending on the sector and size of the business, can deliver markedly higher profits (co-owned businesses seem to work best when they've got fewer than 75 staff and operate in knowledge- or skill-intensive sectors).

The received wisdom for years has been that shareholder value ""the belief that a company's primary purpose is to maximise its value for the benefit of external shareholders"" is the only way to judge a business. But a company is about far more than the price of its shares. It's about ""people, relationships, knowledge, reputation, all of which have enormous impact on long-term value. Firms are social and political, not just economic and financial."" That's not, though, the way many people see things – at least until the recent banking crisis showed just how bad the shareholder value model was ""as a mechanism for accountability, and for creating value"".

*And I would be willing to wager that cooperative companies tend to act more socially responsible when it comes to the environment. Two birds one stone. But that’s a discussion for another time.*

Nb, The research alluded to in the article may or may not have been engaged by John Lewis. You can make your own mind up by following the [link.](http://www.johnlewispartnership.co.uk/Display.aspx?MasterId=3dc563d5-3baa-4186-9f81-e1604e0094a7&amp;NavigationId=1753) 

It is difficult to tell for sure but research less intimately entwined with the corporate interest represented would be very welcome.

true,Marogian,eng-essex,Essex boy in London,"The organisation behind the November 24th protest was awful. The student union heads...whichever group of morons is behind this need to be replaced. Seriously. Either they WANT there to be mayhem, violence and disorder or they have absolutely no idea how to run a peaceful protest. 

Hint: Coaching in 50,000 hot-headed students, telling them to be angry then directing them down a road isn't how to start a peaceful protest.

Hell, even the tea party in America have the common sense necessary to not cause mayhem when they want to protest, and our police are *not* worse than the Americans. I'm not particularly criticising the students in this, they're not really at fault apart from taking part in this clusterfuck, its the entire way its been organised from the top. You *cannot* put that many people in a small area, be angry about an emotive issue and not give them something positive to focus on and a goal at the end of the day. Its utterly moronically stupid.

Where did these idiots get the attitude that a 'right to protest' translates as a right to put a huge group of angry people in a road, act annoyed when some of them smash stuff up and then act mortally offended when the police don't cooperate when they're being pelted with bricks, sticks and flaming debris. This is utterly utterly asinine. I feel sorry for the kids; they're not old enough to realise what an absurd protest they've been taking part in. The older students taking part got pretty much what they went along for.. a long, cold angry night with nothing to do apart from getting into conflict with society.

There's a reason the Iraq War protests went well, the G20 protests went well (until the Police fucked things up) and a dozen others in between. There's also a reason why these protests are utterly dire.

For note, I would actually take part in a anti-student fees protest if they organised something worthy of attending.

Pregnant women are evolved to cry when they perceive danger. The fact that she is crying is an indication that she is pregnant and perceives danger (because there genuinely is a *potential* for danger in that situation she is in: horses are fairly big and if she falls over there is a very real chance that she can be trampled), not that she was actually hurt or actually in danger. 

As for the sarcasm and hyperbole (*""Panic over. Sleep soundly in your beds. Nothing to see here. Move on.

1) You can't tell how many people were in that first 'charge'. It is a known police tactic to apprehend/arrest someone by using that sort of tactic. I doubt there would have been many people in that area.

2) That second lot of horses moving (near the cameraman) is no-where near a 'charge'. You can see that the horses are walking, or at best, trotting. They don't break into a canter, unlike the first 'charge'. As is shown, if someone walked briskly away from the horses, you get get away from them easily. You can even see that the horses move towards the left hand side of the street. Surely if they wanted to charge at, and disperse, the crowd, they would move into the centre of the street?

Horses, like other animals, such as cows, will instinctively go around an obstacle, like a person. That is why jumping obstacles are in horse competitions: because it's HARD to make a horse jump over an obstacle. I don't know why that woman was crying, because you don't see the incident, and by the looks of it that 'kid' was at least 15, so he can handle himself.

This doesn't mean that the use of horses was justified: it probably wasn't. You don't see any reason for the horses moving in that video. That said, there is a lot of over-hype of what the police did. It seems a lot of students are trying to place the blame for what some of the students did on the police and government (the smashing up of that police van for example).

It reminds me of this part from _The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists_:

&gt; 'Poverty is not caused by men and women getting married; it's not caused by machinery; it's not caused by ""over-production""; it's not caused by drink or laziness; and it's not caused by ""over-population"". It's caused by Private Monopoly. That is the present system.

&gt;They have monopolized everything that it is possible to monopolize; they have got the whole earth, the minerals in the earth and the streams that water the earth. The only reason they have not monopolized the daylight and the air is that it is not possible to do it. If it were possible to construct huge gasometers and to draw together and compress within them the whole of the atmosphere, it would have been done long ago, and we should have been compelled to work for them in order to get money to buy air to breathe.

&gt;And if that seemingly impossible thing were accomplished tomorrow, you would see thousands of people dying for want of air--or of the money to buy it--even as now thousands are dying for want of the other necessities of life. You would see people going about gasping for breath, and telling each other that the likes of them could not expect to have air to breathe unless they had the money to pay for it.

In exactly the same spirit as you now say: ""It's Their Land,"" ""It's Their Water,"" ""It's Their Coal,"" ""It's Their Iron,"" so you would say ""It's Their Air,"" ""These are their gasometers, and what right have the likes of us to expect them to allow us to breathe for nothing?""

And meantime, all around, people will be dying for want of some of the air that he will have bottled up in his gasometers. 

&gt;And when you are all dragging out a miserable existence, gasping for breath or dying for want of air, if one of your number suggests smashing a hole in the side of one of the gasometers, you will all fall upon him in the name of law and order, and after doing your best to tear him limb from limb, you'll drag him, covered with blood, in triumph to the nearest Police Station and deliver him up to ""justice"" in the hope of being given a few half-pounds of air for your trouble.'",0,1290853736,null,0,false,0,c171e4x,t3_ec8ss,t1_c171e4x,t3_ec8ss,null,1426597028,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

Nowhere in the article was it said they had the ""right"" to smash the van. The commenter avoided the issue: Entrapment is criminal in my opinion. And in a court of law, if such a case was made, the evidence of vandalising their shitty van would be thrown out as unfair. I don't give a shit about the students' ""right"" to smash the van.

I found myself in a not to dissimilar situation to you about 2 months ago. Looking back at it now, I realise that these problems have existed for years, going back about 5 or 6 years to when I was 16 (21 now), possibly even longer than that but it is difficult to remember.

About 6 weeks ago, after a particularly bad spell I was having I decided that I should finally get some medical advice, I rang up my University Health Centre and saw a Doctor that day, after 10 minutes or so chatting with him he decided to refer to me the mental health centre. I felt so relieved that I had finally sought out profession help after first trying about 2-3 years ago but I kept backing out, even with this relief though the wait for the appointment letter to see the nurse psychiatrist is painful, about 9 days of worrying if the Doctor had actually taken me seriously or whether he had just not bothered to refer me because he assumed I was just a over-exaggerating student. Thinking back, my uni Doctor was actually pretty good, I can't fault him.

The nurse psychiatrist I saw at the mental health centre was brilliant, this 'appointment' basically entailed me and him chatting for about 45 minutes with him taking some notes. He then decided he would refer me to a psychiatrist. this was about 2 weeks ago, I had to wait another 10 days for the appointment letter to come through for this one. I hate the waiting, it just fuels a paranoid mind. 

I now have an appointment to see the Psychiatrist next week, so it has been about 6/7 weeks from Doctors visit to psychiatrist appointment, which I consider very reasonable. 

Waiting around isn't fun, I helped myself by removing external negative influences to the extent that I have deferred my final University year and moved back home. Cut down my drinking and stopped taking drugs too although I don't think this has really done that much for my mental health, great for my physical health though (noticeably better skin for one).

You say your old GP was great, why not go see her? Even if it means travelling across the country or other such measure, if you need the help you might have to work for it. Something I realised when I started this process is that I have to work hard to achieve a better state of mind, at one point I had this vision in my mind that I would go see the doctor, I would tell him what's wrong and he would give me some magic pills and everything would be better. The professionals can only help point you in the right direction.

Just thought I would add, I don't suffer from depression, although I occasionally get down I wouldn't describe myself as a sufferer of depression. I went to the doctors with different problems. 

Feel free to ask me anything, I hope you get the help you need.

a) She does nothing. Of course, that's not really true; she plays the same role as any ceremonial head of state, like Germany's president for example: To separate out the political government from the apolitical state in both honours and general patriotism, to provide for a top diplomat to cultivate long-term relations with foreign heads of government and state, to serve as a constitutional buffer when democracy breaks down (cf Spain 1981 and King Juan Carlos).

A monarch provides this, IMO in a better way than a president would, by having much longer terms than any president is likely to have enabling much deeper relationships with foreign politicians, which the Commonwealth is a prime example of. It also means that the head of state is not a clapped out politician like in so many other countries, which would be the likely outcome of any republican system.

b) She costs too much. Which also usually has connotations of the civil list being some sort of payment to her, which is not true - it's the budget of the organisation of the monarchy which does the same job as the presidency of a country like Germany or Ireland or the like. The Crown Estates, part of the monarchy, pay into the Treasury over £200m profit a year, which is much more than even the most inflated estimate of royal expenditure.

Besides, there's not actually much hate for HMTQ.

Fair do's.

I posted this because a) it's an amazing image imho, and b) it hopefully sparks debate on the whole issues surrounding the protest.

I think it's natural that any report on the protest will focus on the more extreme events though. I'm not sure it's even such a bad thing. If the general public see how angry people are over this issue they may really start paying attention. There's also an argument that with enough civil unrest the government may start to look like their out of control - that's obviously a matter of perception. If that happens they may have to seriously reconsider their plans and if things escalate, they could even be forced to stand down.

I totally agree that kettling is a serious issue and something people should be aware of.

The van is a very short distance from police lines when left. If the occupants were so concerned by trouble, this is not evidenced by the Sky video starting at 12.48.

true,blindinlight,null,null,"Firstly, I wouldn't say I *hate* any human beings. Even those that I'd call ""evil"" (which *doesn't* include the royals!) I'd try to have some sort of understanding for. So let's tone down the language a bit...

...I don't support a monarchy. *If* she's our ""head of state"" it's by dint of convention and inertia, not because of anything she's done to earn the position, or anything *we've* done to put here in it. If you regard yourself as having a ""state"" with such a ""head"" - that's a matter for you. I choose not to - a matter for me - although I know that for various technical reasons (passports, contract law etc.) I participate in the pantomime, just as a ""citizen"" of any regime in the world goes about getting on with life in spite of governance they don't agree with on various levels. The social contract is, and always was, one of pragmatic acquiescence, not enthusiastic participation.

I find it hard to understand how anyone who's thought the matter through can feel *pride* in the monarchy. Sorry, that is a bit snarky, but what you're saying is you're *proud* to be - by dint of circumstances outside your control - born in a particular place at a particular time, and somehow associate yourself with a particular social phenomena with a particular history. That's a pretty conceited position for anyone to take - the monarchy (I assume) has relatively little to thank you for. You didn't do anything to establish it, and if you've done anything to protect it, I surmise your role was either very small, or largely imaginary. 

Furthermore, if you're going to take pride in your country, as represented by the royals, you're pretty inconsistent if you don't take *responsibility* for all its other historical ""achievements""!

Those achievements include (hard to know when to start!) the crusades, various domestic supressions from the peasant's revolt &amp; the civil war to the present day, repatriation of Russian soldiers to their certain doom, empire and all its excesses and consequences around the world... if you're (for some reason) *proud*, there are things you should also be *ashamed* of.

All of us, I know, have a weird game to play when we consider ourselves in a historical context, and it's hard to know where our personal responsibility and allegiance begins and ends. E.g. I opposed the last Iraq war, and voted against the labour government that took ""us"" into it - but *if* this is a functioning democracy which I support, I am presumably partly responsible for it. These are complex issues - but a monarch does not give them any clarity. Rather, it focusses attention in entirely the wrong place.

Finally - the money. I don't actually give a damn about the cost of the royal family, and my reason is this: the royal family is *actually* sustained in the 21st century primarily as a distraction. A media event that can be reliably invoked to mix into the headlines and ensure that debate remains just debate, and that any actual *action* will immediately become divisive. The monarchy wasn't *designed* that way, but nevertheless it is the purpose it *actually* serves. Debates about its cost etc. are now just part of its true function! Compared to the other things that are wrong with the structure of the economy, and resource allocation, the cost of the royal family is a fart bubble in a swimming pool!

There is literally nothing which justifies their special status other than the fact somewhere along the line they share blood lines with a successful warlord.

My own suggestions: your status as a student does not in any way affect the service you should be getting from the NHS, or make you more or less likely to be suffering from something a doctor should deal with properly. If you've hit upon an unresponsive quack, go to another. Different surgery, different town if necessary, but do it.

My own experience with NHS (not mental health related) was that you need to be quite pushy to get the right treatment, and some doctors (hospital specialists in my own case) will do their best to get you out of the door if you don't fit the exact thing they're used to dealing with nice and efficiently. For me this meant ""we'll do this test we do on everyone else. Hmm, not showing anything... better come back in six months and do it all over again"".

In *your* case this translates as a GP saying ""I'm unable to deal with this person, and my long-nurtured conservatism about mental illness and cynicism about students leads me to suspect it's not a ""real"" illness, so I'll do precisely nothing"".

That is his / her problem, not yours. Insist on a referral to someone who knows what they're doing: counsellor, psychologist, whatever - who can then get you the treatment you need, whatever it is! If they won't refer you, try other doctors, and don't let a couple of raddled old quacks get you down. There are also some bloody brilliant people working in the NHS, when you find one you'll know it.

Edit: meant to add: Go to your citizen's advice bureau.

Then the protest seem to have gotten violent, looking at the videos, because the people at the front probably thought they already had been kettled and *then* the police shut down the rest of the routes as the protest had become violent, making the kettle.

I'm disputing when it actually happened.

It seems the time lines on the Guardian just say ""Kettle"" started at 1pm with no mention of the fact that Parliament Square was closed off earlier and separately.

And I don't actually believe that closing off Parliament Square was an unreasonable action given what happened last time.

And I'm also not claiming the kettling was spontaneous, I'm sure they had it planned if the protest became violent, which it did. I'm just questioning whether the kettle or the violence came first.

Here's a source by the way:

It says that Parliament was closed off at 13:00 confirmed at 13:19 when it says the group has not been kettled. It then says the group is kettled by 13:30, after the van was smashed and riot gear stolen. From the videos I've seen elsewhere it looks like this was also the time when the police were being pelted with rocks and sticks.

&gt;    Matthew Taylor

&gt;    There are several thousand students kettled at the bottom of Whitehall, near Parliament Square. They've been stopped here now for about 10-15 minutes. It has been predominantly good-natured, although very noisy.

&gt;    Just now, though, a group of protesters have isolated a police van, and there are people climbing on top of it as others rock it to and fro.

&gt;    The van has been abandoned by police. However, a couple of hundred police officers and half a dozen police vans lie in the way up ahead.

She ended the night perfectly safe. In fact, statistically, she would probably have been in more potential danger crossing the street to get there, or driving in a car to get there](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ec2ie/shocking_video_when_horse_mounted_police_charged/c171fzs)""*

So a) pregnant women are always in danger and b) she was in as much danger as she would be crossing the street or being in a car. 

&gt; I am judging the police on their actions in this protest and in past protests. This is quite a simple concept

You're judging this particular video of this particular protest that you can see with your very own eyes in front of you and judge for yourself on whether the police shot a brown guy a while ago. You would rather judge their actions not on what you can see in front of you, but on your prejudgement of them. Prejudice. 

&gt; I am not interrupting a conversation, that is not how threaded public forums work. You started this subthread by attempting to belittle the poster of the link

I asked him why he said the pregnant woman was pushed to the floor when she wasn't; he replied, I replied. The upshot was that he agreed the pregnant woman wasn't pushed to the floor. (although he then invented another person that was pushed to the floor instead, and also invented that the pregnant woman was charged by horses - both of which aren't true). Only someone that doesn't like cold hard facts (the cold hard fact that no pregnant women were pushed to the floor) could possibly interpret that as belittlement. What you're really mean here is that you don't like it when the truth is pointed out, especially if it contrasts with your prejudice, and that you regard having the truth pointed out as belittlement. 

If you have something relevant to whether the pregnant woman was pushed to the floor or not, please contribute it. If you don't, feel free to keep making stuff up and I'll happily keep quoting the truth back to you.

true,Marogian,eng-essex,Essex boy in London,"...How does that not suggestion the actions of ""stopped them going forward""? If all those police are ahead of them it doesn't matter how many of them there are.

They couldn't move back? You mean just because the crowd was so big? ...uh, so the police shouldn't be allowed to stop the protesters reaching Parliament because crowds, as a whole, are usually dumb as shit? That's a really bad argument. They should have let the large protest go wherever they like simply because there's a danger that in blocking a road people become impatient and become violent? That's absurd.

It is not unreasonable for the police to block the route ahead to Parliament. It is completely unreasonable for the crowd to become violent because they have. I'll admit that the individuals at the front probably thought that they had been kettled, but they hadn't (if this scenario is correct), so it is entirely the crowd's fault for becoming violent, if what I think happened is in fact the case.

The crowd should have just turned back and gone somewhere else, the fact that they didn't is due to a communication break down, which is probably indicative of bad organisation. I've never been in a protest that large, but I would have thought that if it was properly organised there'd be organisers/leaders every few hundred metres with CB radios able to tell people to turn around?

I'll agree that kettling the group before they became violent was the wrong course of action. Blocking them off from reaching Parliament isn't unreasonable in my opinion. Kettling them after they became violent, whilst I don't generally approve of kettling, doesn't seem to be *that* unreasonable. The police cannot control hundreds/thousands of people if they scatter and are violent- just look at the EDL protests, its utter mayhem. Keeping them all in one place is the only way the Police can control the situation.

It completely sucks, but again, if the crowd becomes violent I think that the police on the whole have to make the decision between kettling or letting a large violent group disperse all over the place. They got it totally wrong at the G20 protests, but from what I've seen it wasn't unreasonable here.

Yes, I'm on the scale that uses facts, evidence and quotes of what was really said and happened rather than using prejudice and preconception to a) prejudge stuff I see on the internet and b) to assume what other people mean instead of reading what they actually said. Here's an example - if someone says a pregnant woman was pushed to the ground by charging police when it never happened, I'll point out that it never happened; I won't use my prejudice against the police to pretend that it did happen, just because it suits my argument to do so.

You:

&gt;Well, I refer you once again to this contemporaneous report for you to make own mind up in light of previous comments.

Me:

&gt;Well this is conflicting evidence. My source seems to indicate that whilst Parliament was shut, the group wasn't kettled in, just stopped from going forward. I don't really know how to resolve the conflict in the reports, although I will say I've read in other places that the police say they shut down access to Parliament Square and then after it got messy they started the actual kettle.

My source isn't invisible, its right there. I did edit it in a couple of minutes after I made the post, but this was 3 hours ago.

The police kettled before any violence.

The old van was abandoned but could easily have been removed at the near police line at the front of it.

The police who were supposedly worried did not exit by the near police line but went through the upcoming crowd to a further police line.

There was no violence when the kettle was initiated.

The police said the kettle was necessary due to actions of violence/actions on the van.

The police kettled before any violence.
The old van was abandoned but could easily have been removed at the near police line at the front of it.
The police who were supposedly worried did not exit by the near police line but went through the upcoming crowd to a further police line.
There was no violence when the kettle was initiated.
The police said the kettle was necessary due to actions of violence/actions on the van.
Threats came from school girls in not winter warm weather clothing.
Having problems?

None of that has been sent to me.

2)
&gt;The one link you gave doesn't back anything you say. Shall I screenshot it? You can read can't you? I don't think that is an ad hom, just a legitimate question.

Yes, I can read. That is self evident.

Here's what I posted:

http://london.indymedia.org/action_timelines/walkout-against-fees-and-cuts

It doesn't back up anything I say? Right.

Lets go over this...

What I said:
&gt;It says that Parliament was closed off at 13:00 confirmed at 13:19 when it says the group has not been kettled.

What it says:
&gt;November 24, 2010 13:19 - Lots of people coming continue to come in from Whitehall. A police van has been surrounded and smashed. The main group seems to be surounded by police, who are blocking their movemnet forward - but the group is not yet kettled

&gt;November 24, 2010 13:00 - Police have blocked the march from entering Parliament square. There are lines of police blocking the whole width of whitehall, backed  up by at least 7 police vans. Behind are at least 15 mounted officers outside Parliament. At the back of the march more police are following. Report and pictures

This seems to be **exactly** what I said.

What I said:
&gt; It then says the group is kettled by 13:30, after the van was smashed and riot gear stolen.

What it says:
&gt;November 24, 2010 13:22 - The main crowd in Whitehall has been blocked by police. The kettled march is now in front of the Cabinet Warroom and marching to Westminster Tube. There seem to be random people in the kettle - even tourists. There could be about 5,000 people. There is building work on one site and people broke through mesh fence. Towards Parliament Square, people are packed in tightly; there is more space towards the other end. There is a van in the middle of the crowd. Pics and report

&gt;November 24, 2010 13:22 - A line of Riot vans is preventing the march from progressing to Parliment. A police van abandoned in the middle of the crowd has been vandalised and sprayed. On each side the demonstartion is hemmed in by police barriers.

&gt;November 24, 2010 13:20 - People are stealing riot gear out of the police van that had been abandoned by the police in the middle of the crowd. It has been smashed.

Again, this is **exactly** what I said. Edit: Actually I said 13:30 when it says 13:20- genuine mistake, but doesn't affect my point, just 10 minutes out.

true,Rookeh,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"I visited Exeter University when I was in the process of doing my UCAS applications - although this was almost 4 years ago now. I'm presently in my final year at Oxford Brookes.

From what I recall, Exeter seemed like a nice enough place...perhaps slightly out of the way, but other than that a reasonably pleasant area. 

As for the University itself, Exeter has pretty decent reputation. IIRC it's somewhere in the top 10 in the Times Good University Guide. Overall, it made a pretty good impression on me during my visit, however at the time they didn't offer the course I was looking for, which was a little disappointing.

As for your questions:

* A passport and perhaps some clothes I guess? :P I can't really think of anything specific that would help you out here in particular.
* At this time of year, warm ones. During the spring it's not so bad, you can usually get away with just a shirt and perhaps a jacket if it gets a bit chilly. Our summers can be very hot, but they ultimately last only a few weeks before it starts pouring with rain again. As a rule, though, our climate is pretty mild.
* I actually live in Cornwall which is the adjacent county, but other than my visit to the University I've had little reason to travel up to Exeter other than to pass through it on the way to somewhere else, so regarding specific activities in the area I can't really help.
* In general? Stay away from large council estates. You'll know them when you see them, all the houses/blocks of flats (aka 'apartment blocks') will look like aged uniform concrete slabs with a million satellite dishes on every wall, and the denizens will all be wearing sporting gear and a good number of them seem to have the IQ of a peanut. They can be pretty rough. It's the same as in any country really, avoid sketchy looking areas and you should be okay.

When Thatcher visited Oxford during her term she asked a young woman what she was studying. The woman replied that she was reading Ancient Norse Literature. ""What a privilege"" replied Thatcher. I's laden with £24k (+ interest, so maybe £30k) of debt for my 'good' first class degree in Computer Science - a subject I dearly love. I was disheartened by the general snobbery held by those who sit a BSc rather than a BA (or, 'Bugger All', as I was told in the first intro lecture by the head of school). It's as if there's no point any subject that doesn't earn money after you graduate - very very sad indeed.

While I say this, I also don't agree that McDonalds (yes, seriously) should have a 'degree' program, or that there needs to be one in bed making, basket weaving etc...

I can't say the same about her heirs. I feel like the monarchy's days are numbered after Elizabeth passes, but I'm not sure how I feel about it. 

The monarchy makes GB unique, and brings in ridiculous amounts of money through tourism without being a massive expenditure on the general population.

Take lots of warm clothes, it's either raining or windy (or both) almost all the time. At the moment it's snowing (I'm ~80 miles north from London) and it's -8 degrees C (that's 17 degrees F) now. 

Don't forget your gadgets, such as phone, laptop, etc. It is very likely that university will have free internet access computers, but still having your own laptop is much more comfortable.

Stay away from workers from Eastern Europe. Students from the same countries are almost always cool guys, no problem with them.

Do not insult people of other religions, it's punishable by law (something something religious hatred). Reasonable debates are welcome but not likely to happen. England is multicultural so you are likely to have students from all over the world in your course. It is not likely that you will be mocked for your beliefs, whatever they are.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"I used to work with and against the police quite a lot, and I have to say I've met both good and bad police officers.  I'll confess that the ""half or more"" above was somewhat of an exaggeration.  However, I don't agree that (most of) the media shows anti-police bias, in fact the reverse, and I do think that there remains something in police culture which is very much ""us against the world"" or ""ends justify means"" or even merely ""we're all in this together, so close ranks and zip mouths at the first sign of a problem"".

Police officers are human beings, some lie, cheat, steal, etc., others have higher moral standards.  I think the major problem is threefold though: firstly, they're in a position of power/trust; secondly, there's a myth which parts of the media, most of the justice system and many of the public subscribe to, which is that they are superhuman in terms of moral rectitude; and finally, they have this ""my colleagues right or wrong"" attitude, which can exacerbate the first two, lead to gross miscarriages of justice and ultimately alienate a large group of people who come into conflict with them.  When these people are people accused of crimes it's bad enough, but when they're people exercising their democratic rights to engage in politics, it's far far worse.  As the police become politicised and agents of the state, the battle lines are drawn and it becomes hard to defuse things.  Sadly, the Conservatives have always been more prone to and more successful in using the police for political purposes (partly because the police as an organization are inherently small c conservative).

Don't expect each Doctor to have a David Tennant-style character arc, because most of them don't.  The Doctor regenerates, has a new personality, and the new Doctor goes around and does stuff, then something bad happens to him and he regenerates again.  That's about it.

And if you're expecting the end of the classic series to be some big event, you'll be very disappointed.  It doesn't.  It pretty much just stops.

ALL the Time War stuff was created for the 2005 series in order to add an element of mystery to the Doctor's past.  There are no references to it in any of the original series stories - basically, it all happened sometime between the 1996 TV movie and the 2005 series, and it's probably what caused the Eighth Doctor to regenerate into the Ninth.  That's all we know.

Some events in the classic series have been semi-retconned to be related to the Time War (notably *Genesis of the Daleks*, which RTD has said is the ""first shot fired"" in the Time War, and *Remembrance of the Daleks* if I'm not mistaken), but IMO that's a load of crap.  The Time War didn't exist until 2005.

I'm holding out hope that one day (anniversary...?) we'll get an episode where the current Doctor meets the Eighth Doctor, and we see the end of the Time War and the Eighth Doctor's regeneration.

So if you have 9k in fees per year plus at least £4.5k per year for living costs (3.5k is from basic maintenance loan, the rest is from overdrafts presumably or bank of mum and dad or London Allowance - try working a part-time job whilst on a rigorous science/engineering timetable :/ ) then you will graduate with £54k in debts.

(Meanwhile in industry the salaries are hardly phenomenal levelling out at about £40k for most areas).

So this debt will severely affect the number of people we have going to do useful research which is the purpose of university and will instead encourage yet more maths and science graduates to seek fortune in the City.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm a postdoc; of course I've seen research salaries.  The £13,000-15,000 PhD stipend is tax free.  It's equivalent to earning around £20,000 p/a, and it gets regularly increased.  Not to mention PhD studies are largely stress free, apart from the final push, when compared to jobs in industry.  The final six months of my PhD saw a monthly increase of about £75.  Further, it's unclear to me why you even mentioned the PhD stipend: as a PhD student you do not repay your student loan.  That only gets taken out after you earn more than a set amount, and the stipend need not be paid back (if it's through a research council like the EPSRC, or a joint one with industry).  So here, it's completely irrelevant.

Further, postdoc salaries are actually pretty decent given the amount of time you're expected to work and the amount of travel and other perks you get out of it.  This point is often missed when discussing salaries in academia compared to industry: contractually I'm entitled to 17 weeks off per year (due to the strange fixed hour contract that I'm on), and I also get to travel (and live in and) around Europe for virtually nothing.  I also get to work in an interesting and varied job (again, something not often mentioned) for a decent wage.  Compare this to the possibility of landing a mind numbing job in industry.  This isn't exploitation; it's a dream job.

(I actually did hold down a part time job for a year as an undergraduate reading a science degree, at least for a year.)

Further, it's still unclear to me how you conclude that this will affect the number of scientists entering research positions.  All loans are paid back after you enter the work force, incrementally, and what you describe (sarcastically?) as a princely sum is actually a pretty good wage, £12,000 higher than the UK national average, and increases quite rapidly with seniority.  For the same wage that I'm on now, I could have joined an investment bank and been on call 24/7.  Remind me why I'd pick that over my current job for an increase of £12k in student loans to be repaid over my lifetime?

Finally, the grass always seems greener when discussing universities on the continent.  Britain has a good claim to having the best universities in the world, or at least just behind American universities.  Why?  Because they receive more money than anywhere else in Continental Europe.  Take any country in Europe and try to name more than two or three truly world class institutions.  Spain?  Italy?  Scandinavia?

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"The entire system is broken at the moment. There is no easy fix for this. We need to move the entire political system away from this centrist and consensus rubbish. As I said very hard to fix. Effectively you need to alter the mood of the nation or you need to alter the political system. The problem is that while compromise on particular policies is a good thing having parties that are compromised on ideal is not. We want parties that are based upon ideals but will compromise (sometimes) to get things done. As opposed to parties that compromise on ideals to win votes from the confused people who cannot see the difference between the two.

Regardless the issue is systemic. The ignorance of the Iraq war protest and the student fees protest are not isolated incidents. It is part of a larger and deep problem in British politics where our democracy is being stolen by entrenched parties agreeing with each other. The only vote that matters now are the votes by party members. The only election that has changed anything this year is the election of Ed Miliband as Labour leader. It threatens to move politics to the left and recentre. However it doesn't solve the underlying problem.

As I see it there are three options, all of them hard:

1. Political reform. Change the voting system to blow the status quo wide open. With real PR we'd see some Greens, a lot more LDs and yes a few UKIP and BNP seats. Regardless there is no way you will ever be able to use consensus to steal democracy in such a system. I think I can handle the BNP having a few seats in exchange for that.

2. Empower a new party. Effectively work to put a new party into power that is distinct enough from the main pair that is also a viable alternative. This is what people have been trying to do with the LDs. Unfortunately the LDs are being forced to compromise to succeed. Same old centrist driving FPTP system.

3. Reform from within. With party membership so low today the main parties are vulnerable to a surge in new supporters. If every person who marched against tuition fees became Labour party members then it would form a significant voting block within that party that can change things.

Personally I see it being a case of all three. I'd like to see the LDs advance but I do not think they will ever get enough on their own to break open the current system. If they did I also think there is the temptation to do a NL on the issue and decide that FPTP works alright for us.

So I'd like to see effectively an assault on the Labour party by a mass of new membership. If we can establish a strong liberal wing within Labour then a combination of a rebalanced Labour party with the LDs can force a change in the political system. I do not believe we will succeed without the support of one of the major parties. Even if we can force a referendum to secure a coalition we get the current situation where the entire establishment is lining up for a no vote.",0,1290977149,null,0,false,0,c176b5w,t3_ecngi,t1_c176b5w,t1_c175yqb,null,1426599392,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,racergr,eu,-,"Generic UK advice:

&gt; What should I make sure I pack?

Make sure you check if your favourite snacks are available here, I am not a snack person but I've seen many high-voted snacks in reddit which I have never seen in the UK.

&gt; What kind of clothes should I pack?

Depends on where you come from. I come from a hot country (Greece) 
and the weather is usually very cold for my liking (I use a winter coat for more than 6 months per year)

&gt; What should I try to NOT say/ what should I stay away from?

* If you are religious, then be quiet about it. Nobody cares. Same about politics.

* Please do not be the fat loud arrogant American who thinks that he brings democracy and freedom to Europe (I'm quite sure that you are not like that since you are a redditor but I'm just saying)

* Try to pretend that you laugh at British humour (yeh, it's hard)

* It is not common to leave a tip to the waiter, although many people do leave a tip but it is usually just pennies, not 10% of the bill and shit like that. Waiters are actually paid ""well"" and have humane working contracts here. In the same lines,  I don't think that anyone leaves a tip to a self-service place.

* Do not attempt to ""date"", there is no dating here, I cannot tell you much because I am afraid I do not fully understand US ""dating"" but I'm quite certain that relationships here start with a different process. Research the subject:)

* Avoid people who have short hair and sportswear, especially if they are teenage groups and wear their socks over the pants. Just don't go anywhere near them, ok?:D

* Protect your staff from thieves at all times. There is not much serious crime in the UK but it is full of smaller crimes.


&gt; What sterotypes are actually true?

I don't know but here is some more  advice:

* Fat girls may be wild, drunk, loud and annoying, also they are not very insecure and they *are* getting laid. I have no idea if that is true in the US but be warned.

* Pub food, Indian food and Arabic food is usually cheap and unhealthy. However, it has been calculated to be about 1238 times better than McDonald's. Burger King is also better than McDonald's. If you are on a restaurant or Pub and notice that they serve bangers and mash, just take it.

* Similarly, do not ""trust"" the US brands you know on anything, it most likely means lower quality (this mistake is usually done in Athens by US tourists. No Greek ever goes to McDonald's, ever. Even when we starve to death.)

* Do not get a TV (unless you cannot live without one). If you want to watch something then watch BBC [iPlayer](http://bbc.co.uk/iplayer). There is ALWAYS something interesting to watch there, there is regular Attenborough, other documentaries, popular science like Horizon, films,  realities, news.

* If you do not have a TV then you **do not need to pay TV Licence** but the TV Licensing authority will do their best to convince you otherwise. They keep sending threatening letters every month but you can just ignore them. I do not have a TV and I have been getting those for like forever. They only knocked the door once, I let them in, they checked and then left. If you do want a TV then stop wanting one because you should not be spending your days abroad watching TV for fucks shake!

* Speaking of TVs, every town must have some shop with used things to buy (inc TVs). They usually sell ex-student, stolen stuff etc but that's fine from your point of view. You don't need to buy these things new.

Usually the British drink beer because they think it's getting you drunk cheaply but I would certainly not agree.

You can/should buy them a round and show them that there is nothing wrong with that :D 

Now seriously, I don't think I'm well qualified to answer that because I spent most of my student life in Scotland where no one would ever think of buying you anything and I'm not a heavy drinker anyway.

However, I have noticed people in the same group queuing and buying their drinks separately, imo this is a sign that they basically don't have enough money to buy rounds to other people as I've mostly seen it in student groups.

In general, people in the UK are very passionate about only paying their ""personal"" expenses and often refuse to accept generosity. For example, I have seen people asking/offering to pay £1 in gas after sharing a ride. It is also perfectly acceptable to split a £10 bill in two or three parts (everyone pays what they had). As a Greek, I'm not familiar with these practices:D

On the other hand, I don't think that anyone would be embarrassed if you offer to buy the next round or something, so let them buy their drinks at first and then offer to buy a round and see how it goes with the group you are in at the moment.

As much as I hate to disagree with David Mitchell, the fact of the matter is that Nick Clegg *wasn't* elected so he's not in any real position of power to be able to make or break his promises.  The best that he can hope to do is either vote against the Tory proposals or try and use his influence to moderate the scheme so that it's *more* fair to students than what the Torys would otherwise be pushing through.

In a world of idealism, voting against the proposals would be better.  However, in the world of pragmatic compromise in which we have found ourselves, I think the second option will probably be better for students in the long run (as much as I hate to say it).

&gt; What should I pack?

The weather can be pretty temperamental. One moment it'll be sunny and the next we could have showers. To be honest though it's all pretty mild stuff really, nothing too extreme. Your best bet is to pack lots of jeans, t-shirts and hooded jackets. You can always buy clothes here in the many high street shops. These can range from the reasonably cheep (Primark, BHS, Burtons), to the average priced high-street fashion shops (Topman, River Island, H&amp;M) to the expensive (Urban Outfitters, All Saints). I'm not sure if you are aware of this, but as a student you will be entitled to student-discount in a lot of fashion stores (Topman included), which can range from 10% to 20% off. Your student discount can be used on all sorts of stuff like buses, cinema tickets, in select restaurants, but you'll be told more when you get settled.



A TV is not entirely necessary as all of what you can watch it available online. Assuming you'll have some sort of computer, you can watch TV through channel specific catch-up services online. These are:

 
* Channel 4 -[4OD](http://www.channel4.com/programmes/4od)


* BBC TV/Radio -[iPlayer](http://www.bbc.c.uk/iplayer)


* ITV -[ITVplayer](http://www.itv.com/itvplayer/)


* Five -[Demand Five](http://www.five.tv/watch)





Those generally are the 5 main TV channels. UK TV has something called terrestrial channels which are the five channels listed above, and then Freeview (as well as subscription based satellite TV such as SKY, Virgin Media, etc, but these wont affect you). Freeview usually is viewable from a purchasable set-top box, but most TVs come with it included nowadays. You can watch all the Freeview channels (as well as the terrestrial channels) live on [TVCatchup.com](http://www.tvcatchup.com) completely free. 

So, if you do feel like watching a bit of TV (and why wouldn't you?) all your bases are covered.




&gt; What are some things I should definitely try to do in the area?

Generally all university towns/cities have a designated 'student night'. This is the night of the week were all the bars and clubs in the area have special offers or nights for the students. They are usually a great night out. If you are a partying person then you might want to catch Freshers Week which is the first few weeks when courses start. Event after event after event. You'll be lucky to get any work done at all.




&gt; What should I try to NOT say/ what should I stay away from?

As long as your not overly pushy with your beliefs you'll be fine. Once you start going down the pub with your group of friends you'll be soon getting into drunken discussions about religion or war, so don't be afraid to speak your mind. Obviously there's racists and sexists and the like who will take things too far and too personal, but they're just nobs.

Talking about pub banter, you should be aware of the English sense of humour. The humour is very dry and could be considered fairly offensive if you are not aware of the 'joke', so to speak. As long as you are aware that people are not purposely trying to offend you then you'll be fine.

Regarding alcohol, just drink what you would usually drink. Personally, I only drink cider as larger/beer knocks me sick.




&gt; What sterotypes are actually true?

All and none. Look, you are always going to find that one knobhead who goes out looking for a fight, and that other chavy prick who thinks he is the the biggest pimp the world has ever seen, but the majority of the time you'll just see and meet normal nice people. It all depends on who you make friends with really. If you become mates with the pricks then thats the sort of people you will most likely encounter. If you get a good group of mates together then you'll be fine. And if some shit does happen because some dick on campus wanted to look tough, don't let it spoil your experience of the UK. You can find people like that everywhere.

This is especially ironic as the Tories had arguably a large enough majority to go it alone; they didn't need the Lib Dems.

Coalition politics mean BOTH parties were elected and they should come to a sensible compromise. None of this 'he's the junior partner' crap, else there's just no point to coalition politics - if both parties combined make a majority, then minus one then means the remainder no longer has sufficient mandate to govern - this to me makes both parties sufficiently responsible.

If we want to have Coalition government in the UK, we need to be able to hold both halves of the party responsible for their manifesto or pledges or whatever else they gave prior to the election, else we are allowing them to be unaccountable - we already are saying party manifestos don't matter as it is a coalition - I'm sorry but I do not believe that to be the case.

Coalition politics should result in compromise, that is true. Compromise however, does not mean outright ditching policies without explanation to your voters - compromise would be demonstrating what you're doing with your central policies and explaining to the public what you've got from not following a particular policy in favour of another. 

David Mitchell's quote in your point demonstrates this - why? What is Nick Clegg's reasoning for not supporting this? Those of us who voted for him should have an explanation because he has not explained why he feels this approach is right.

Coalition politics has a long way to go and needs to become more responsible and stop excusing itself.

I admit, being an adult and having to look after myself can be challenging at times, and a nanny state to look after me seems comforting, but I feel I can resist for now.

Facetiousness aside, surely the Tories and Lib Dems are more opposed to a nannying by state or corporation than other political parties in the UK? Furthermore, to start dividing the internet into appropriate and inappropriate content invites all sorts of abuses and only leads down the road to Chinese style internet censorship. Whilst this may seem like hyperbole, it isn’t inconceivable to imagine that a filter put in place with ‘good intentions’ grows and grows and starts encompassing political materials that are disagreeable, or whistleblowing websites. The internet is perhaps the last bastion of freedom of speech in our modern world, a digital speaker’s corner, and to impinge upon this would be extremely damaging indeed.

Furthermore, it belies a misunderstanding of the internet and it’s technological function too, and as an increasingly digitally literate populace develops, the filter would become ineffective and frustrating to a class of people that would recognize its anti democratic nature.

As for the argument of protecting the children, surely parents should be doing that rather than Virgin Media? Should we have state mandated filters on sharp objects in the home now in case a child hurts themselves with those too?

Prime Ministers are never elected (other than as MPs), parties are just artificial constructs of convenience, a manifesto is just a wish list, but the corner stone of our democracy is the relationship between the MP and their constituents.
I have no problem with a party compromising manifesto policies for a coalition agreement - there's nothing unusual or untoward about this.  
The issue here is that individual MPs promised their constituents that they would vote a certain way if elected, and some people would have chosen them as their representatives in parliament on that basis.
People understand that a manifesto policy will not necessarily get enacted just because they vote in an MP who happens to belong to a party that wrote that manifesto.  That's all fine.  But a promise to vote a certain way is a promise that undoubtedly *can* be kept whether your 'party' wins or not.  If you ask people to vote you in as their representative on the basis of a written commitment that you will personally represent their views on a given issue, that goes to the heart of parliamentary democracy.  These were often first time voters. At best, the damage done by this in terms of increasing voter cynicism and decreasing future participation in the political system is unforgivable, at worst it's downright fraud.  The Liberal Democrats shouldn't have even contemplated this and the Conservatives should never have asked them to.  These issues are more important than those of student loans.

Dear Mr Samuels,

Thank you for contacting me about internet traffic management.

I am aware of the issues and concerns regarding 'net neutrality'. The possibility of private enterprises controlling the flow of traffic on the internet is something which needs to be evaluated.

Ofcom, the communications regulator, has existing powers and duties in this area which will be strengthened by amended EU rules that will be transposed into UK law in 2011. These include potential powers to oblige operators to be transparent about the traffic management techniques that they put in place.

The Government has made clear that it will work to secure an open, transparent internet, avoid regulation and encourage competition. I feel that this is a sensible position in light of the tremendous amount of innovation and business growth that the internet has driven in recent years; intervention should be required only when it is clearly necessary to deliver important benefits for consumers.

Thank you for contacting me on this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me again if you have any further questions.

Yours sincerely,
Matt.

My apologies.  You are absolutely correct in that Nick Clegg *was* elected.  What I should have said was that the Liberal Democrats were not elected with a majority and thus Nick Clegg was not in any position of power.

However, what I did and didn't mean to say is irrelevant.  In this light of this, David Mitchell is absolutely correct... Nick Clegg was *himself* elected on this promise and he should explain to his constituents why he's not voting against it.  I retract my disagreement with David Mitchell, but I'll leave my comment there so the thread makes sense, (even if I don't).

I totally agree with your assessment of coalition politics and the way it *should* work.  However, I'm not convinced that the Tories see the LibDems as equal partners.  I think that's what I'm really trying to get at - the LibDems are the ones getting blamed for everything, but they're really the minor partners here.

true,sweetcorny,english,England,"I didn't apply for a visa but I wish I had. Just went over to live for 6 months with my now-husband. I had planned to do my job from his home - like telecommuting but home is just very far away as my bosses were cool with that.

Nothing I read online at the time lead me to believe that I'd have to get a visa for this purpose.

In any case, when I arrived at the airport they ended up holding me in the back office for 3 hours until the manager showed up to say ""yay"" or ""nay"". They called my now-husband to verify our plans. We had to verify that I was financially stable and if I wasn't my now-husband could take care of me. They had to make sure I had something to go back to AND I had to have a return ticket booked and in place.

After all of that, they let me in but said if I left the country and came back in (say, for a weekend in Paris) I'd have to probably go through the whole schtick again. So needless to say, I didn't leave the UK the whole time I was there. Who wants to take the chance? They had the right to send me back home if they wished.

I was supposed to register with the local police within 30 days (but I never did), I couldn't claim any help like healthcare or public funds like welfare. I mean, if you have an emergency and NEED care they will take care of you and treat you but you can't just walk in for a cold or a rash expecting care and a prescription. I thought of that ahead of time and bought an international medical insurance policy for myself before I left.

Once I got back to the States, I went to the nearest consulate (in Los Angeles for me) and applied for a multi-entry visa just to ensure that the next time I went to the UK, they wouldn't give me any shit.

One thing is when you come you cannot tell them you plan to get work here to support yourself. They might want proof on you like 3-6 months of bank records to prove your savings. This is imperative. So even if you borrow a couple thousand to put into your account and then give it back to the person you borrowed it from, do it if you can. Otherwise you will look totally suspicious and they might send you back to the US without ever leaving the airport.

Go the extra mile to make yourself look or be legit if you plan on not getting a visa. Or you can just lie and say you're here visiting friends (but then they might ask where you're staying and what their names are, etc.) Book a ticket that says you're going back to the US in 2-3 weeks and just call and change your ticket when you get there. Ya know, just to fool immigration.

&gt;Dr Mr Cameron,

&gt;Thank you for your email on the 19th November about net neutrality.

&gt;Net neutrality means many things to many people and is therefore mired in confusion. If it is taken to mean the complete neutrality of networks to treat all data which passes over their pipes in the same way at all times, this does not exist in today's market and arguably never has. All networks manage and shape their traffic to ensure that their customers receive a good quality of service, They do this by prioritising certain time sensitive applications and services (such as streaming video or VOIP) over those which are less time sensitive (such as email). This is a practice which does not generally cause any major problems and ensures their networks can deliver an acceptable quality of service at peak times.

&gt;The danger is if internet service providers (ISPs) prioritise traffic for commercial reasons - for example, if an ISP gives more bandwidth to their own video streaming service than they do to a competitor's. This is not a situation which has developed so far in the UK. Ofcom's recent consultation on the issue agrees with this assessment.

&gt;The Internet has been hugely successful without regulation. Legislation could lead to unintended consequences in the future. However I know that Ofcom will be keeping a close eye on this issue. While ISPs and networks are free to innovate, Ofcom will intervene should the market develop in an anti competitive way.

&gt;The Internet needs to remain as open and innovative as possible. I believe the best way to do this is by letting the market develop and for users to pick the winners and the losers.

&gt;Thank you again for taking the time to contact me

A couple of things though. I just looked at the video again, several times. Starting about 1:05, as the camera swings across, it looks to me like the horses are actually slowing up as they reach the body of the crowd. You can pretty much see the momentum disappear. Then the camera swings back again, and there are horses right there. They must have come up pretty quickly. So I think they were going at speed right before the filming started, directly into the crowd. I think that fits in with quickly and forcefully, and rush aggressively towards. 

The other thing is, any time I've been near police horses they've been holding a line, or slowly physically pressing against a crowd to move it. Relatively non aggressive, but effective. That's not what happened here. So what do we call it if not a charge. I'm not sure there is any other word that's appropriate, that conveys both speed and aggressive intent.

And it isn't my own definition, though I used the wording from wikipedia, it's based on the book 'The Face of Battle' by John Keegan, which looks at some of the myths of warfare.

Labour have seen a small surge, that's going to partly because people are disappointed. They don't really have to do anything at the moment. They have the 'luxury' of opposition. There are obviously going to be internal manoeuvres, many needed, but they don't have to put policy forward, yet can object to actual policies enacted. It doesn't let them off the hook, but that's reality.

As for the Lib Dems, well, they were always considered the third party or the choice of a protest vote. They have two factions and have always dithered on position. Now that third option is gone, they are seen as a right wing group that sold out to enable Conservative policy. They cannot go back from that now. The Conservatives are holding up as the Conservatives are doing what Conservatives do. You are seeing a split in the vote where the third party once occupied. Further, the Lib Dems have turned their back on perhaps their greatest source of future support in much the same way Labour did on the people it once fought for. As Mitchell says

&gt;What did he get for compromising so many of his party's principles? A referendum on a type of electoral reform that it never advocated. He should have held out for full PR or made the Tories govern as a minority. The political will was with him then. But he didn't sense it and he took the important-sounding job.

true,CraigTorso,null,null,"UK shows generally have a maximum of 2 writers, and normally it's just one, unlike US shows that are written by a team of writers in committee, meaning the epsidoes take a lot longer to write.

Another factor is that the size of budgets available in the UK is a fraction of what is available for a US show, there just isn't the money for long series runs.

The BBC run 12 episode series for their big-budget family dramas like Dr Who and Merlin, and ITV run similar length series with their iffy but fast paced Primeval, but they know there's an international and domestic market for those shows. 

I doubt Channel 4 was expecting anyone outside the UK to be paying attention to Misfits, a show about London youth offenders with superpowers and bad attitudes didn't sound like it's going to set the international TV market ablaze.  The first run of Misfits was on E4, their youth/entertainment minority channel, it wasn't expected to be mainstream. 

They commissioned a second series when the domestic reception was glowing, but money is extremely tight a Channel 4 at the moment so 6 episodes is probably all they could prudently afford.

You mean like how Sky bundle their TV, internet and phone? Or how BT does it? Or O2? Orange? Talktalk?

All larger players, but the products are available on a wholesale basis (from BT and others, like the LLU operators) for others to sell. In particular, BT's wholesale prices are set with the agreement of the regulator.

Virgin is pretty much allowed to do what it wants because it isn't the monopoly incumbent operator. Fair? Probably not, but that's life. Oh, and they don't really have a fibre network. They stretch the definition as far as they can even though their network is actually pretty poor. 

BT has a true fibre network - they are rolling out fibre to the cabinet in a lot of places, and fibre to the home in some.

&gt;And tax credits, housing benefit (where rent is paid), child benefit? None of these are any help to poor farmers with families? If they don't claim, they should not moan.
Another key point is that these farms are small businesses. When they talk about 'income' it's often after a lot of family running costs have disappeared into the farm's accounts. Vehicles, heating oil, farmhouse repairs, utilities, even mobile telephones. Miscellaneous one off domestic items get put through the books so the VAT can be reclaimed. Bed and breakfast is often done on a cash basis and is quite profitable for those that do it because UK B&amp;B prices are high.

&gt;Finally, the tax treatment on sale of a farm is really generous and when a farm is passed on, IHT is often minimal as is CGT. This is important because agricultural land values have soared in recent years, making even small owner-farmers very rich on paper.

&gt;So things are not exactly as they might seem.
