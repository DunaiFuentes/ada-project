I saw how my parents had to live when I was growing up and have heard more than enough stories of how my grandparents lived from them and others. Their eras sucked compared to ours. Today even rocks compared to my childhood years.

Unlike my grandfather, I'm not being conscripted or working 3 jobs at once and rarely seeing my family just in order to get food on the table. Nor am I a racist like he was and nor are such opinions considered acceptable anymore. Unlike my grandmother, my wife isn't controlled or ""disciplined"" by her husband and nor is such accepted now as it was in the 1950s and before.

Unlike my father, I've grown up in a time where people of different sexualities, genders, and races are treated more fairly than ever before (but it could always get better). As a kid, I didn't ""have"" to go to church just because everyone else did.

Unlike even people in the 1970s and earlier, I'm alive in a time where even people little above the poverty line typically own the latest technology like microwaves, TVs, computers, refrigerators, and the like. I live in a time where clothing is cheap and not everything has to be constantly fixed. Some of it may be lower quality but the price is even lower to match. I live in a time where I can clean my entire house and all of my clothes within an hour or two rather than spending all day. I live in a time where we have the Internet and we have spare time for discussions like this rather than constantly stressing about how bad life is.

On the other hand, I don't see it as a bad thing that there are a lot of wealthy people in the UK because I know that wealth is not a zero sum game. If I get richer, you do not get poorer. For most, it has never been easier to earn a living. Nor do I see a ""every man for himself"" attitude as a bad thing, as long as it's one not maintained by screwing over other people or avoiding your debts to society (e.g. taxes).

You look at your neighbour countries who do things differently with decent results and your solution is to follow the lead of us Americans? Really? If only the US had the proximity to mainland Europe as you do, we might know more and be smarter about how the way the world works; what does and what doesn't, for example.

To me it seems like it feeds upon itself. Things are bad and people are frustrated, so they ask gov't to turn the screws tighter. Which of course frustrates people and makes things worse, requiring more. So many things normal to human nature are being taken from your hands, like the right to assert yourself. It's oppressive!

I read so many news stories from the UK and they remind me what is wrong with the US, except the perverse twist is a sense of powerlessness I get when reading your version of events. In the US you feel you have the option to ""let the buck stop here"", but there you're neutered. No wonder people are angry. They're being emasculated as a society.

No, you have to reverse course. Start investing in things that get people to feel hope. There's got to be compassion and tough love. That's your problem with the ""if you don't like it, lump it"" thing. No one gets rewarded for doing the right thing or caring about others. Or at least not rewarded in any sort of relevant way.

&gt; The other issue is the 'every man for himself' attitude we seem to be adopting from the states.

Hell yes.  

I can't stand people who say ""Why don't *they* do something about it?"".  Who are ""*they*?"".  The council?  The government?  Inter-fucking-national Rescue?  Yeah, right!  You pay your taxes so you have a ""right"" to service, is that it?

Well fuck that.  I like people who say ""Why don't *we* do something about it? 

Snow in your road?  Get a fucking shovel and move it!

Old lady living next door?  Clear her path, too, and ask her if she needs anything picking up from the shops.

Common fucking sense, people!

&gt; Personally, I gritted the footpath in front of my house and one of my neighbours (older couple) along with the tire tracks in the road.

You and me both.  I live at the bottom of a hill which joins onto a main road.  I've spent about 10 hours in total clearing the snow off the end of our road to keep it open.  It's not just convenience, but safety.  You wouldn't believe the number of idiots who think they can drive a car down a hill covered in ice and expect to be able to stop at the end of it, instead of sliding across the main road and ploughing into the school playground (thankfully, not yet).  

I don't want a medal or any special recognition (although I certainly appreciated the people who made a point of stopping to thank me).   What I'm doing is what everyone should be doing - a little bit to improve your immediate surroundings and to make life better/easier for you and the people around you.

There's about a hundred or so houses in the little cluster of roads where I live.  How many other people have been out clearing snow?  Precisely one.  Last time we had snow it was precisely zero - I was the only one.

Everywhere I go, the pavements and side roads are still covered in ice and snow. Everywhere.  I can count the number of cleared paths/roads on one hand.

Is it really so bad that 99% of people just can't be arsed to do anything to help?  I can understand being too damn lazy to help other.  But when you can't even be bothered to help yourself then you are fail.

I never wanted him to be sacked at all, seeing as the year before the bad season we were [genuine title contenders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008–09_Premier_League#League_table), but the fans got their way.

Now that they perceive Roy Hodgson to be the devil himself (hint: he is actually pretty good), they are desperate to sack him.

If those kinds of fans get their way, Liverpool will have a brand new coach every six months, each of which will try to make their own mark on the squad and youth teams, each time restarting them, and we'll end up treading water. I've said it before but nothing permanent can be built on shifting sands. 

Take SAF as a benchmark of what can happen when you trust a manager, let him build a team, make long term strategic decisions. If a manager is terrified he'll lose his job if he loses three games in a row, then they'll play safe each game.

I'm actually getting pretty annoyed here about all of this talk of Rafa coming back. I like him, respect him, but to bring him back now would be an embaressment seeing as we sacked him not so long ago. Perhaps those vocal fans will get their way, and when we end up 7th, 8th, 9th the next few seasons and they are screaming for rafa to be sacked, I'll be here again posting the same stuff as now.

It's possible you could be sued, but very unlikely.  It has never happened in the UK.

A successful claimant would have to demonstrate that you acted maliciously or recklessly. The burden of proof is on them and the mere fact that you're clearing snow in the first place is a strong indicator that you were working to improve the situation (""assuming a duty of care"" I believe it is called).

So if you deliberately flood your street to make an ice rink then you might be at risk.  If you clear the snow, you are not.

Note that the situation is different for council property.  They have an obligation under the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957 to a ""duty of care"" for visitors to their property.  They *must* go to reasonable lengths to clear the snow and make it safe.  Individuals can *assume* this responsibility for their own property or the public property outside their house, but as long as they are not acting maliciously or recklessly then they cannot be held accountable for it.

true,rbnc,cnty-wales,Wales. Living in Germany.,"I was having this exact same conversation yesterday. I left the UK in September, though there are a few things I miss, I'm not planning on moving back anytime soon. 

Basically, if you want to be somewhere interesting and have a healthy career in the industry I work in, you have to be in London, and London is terribly cutthroat, rent is way too expensive, landlords don't care, ISPs are terrible, it doesn't feel safe, and the NHS although I would prefer the NHS to an American style system, is crumbling under the weight of a rapidly expanding population.

I do miss a lot about London and the UK, the UK is undoubtably the cultural capital of Europe, it creates so much music, tv and writing for a country relatively small compared to its output.

For a man with simple demands from life, Berlin is perfect, I'm earning €75k, almost doubling my salary in London, yet my rent is €411 a month for a small but very nice one bedroom flat, my landlord sends people on the day I make a complaint if my sink is leaking, my internet is fast, its safe to walk around at night, the quality of food is consistently excellent and cheap,  and there's loads going on here. In Germany things are sensible, Post Offices open at 5am and close at 8pm, the tube and buses run 24/7, even on Christmas, you receive child benefit for your kids until they're 25, if they're still in education, which is great if they're at uni, oh and Uni costs €500 a year, not £3-9k.

**tl;dr** I loved the UK; but it was too stressful. I've moved to Berlin, earning twice as much as in London, living costs are half what they were in London.

**edit** further point,  When it snows in Germany, life goes on as per normal. Oh, and Germany's economy is booming, jobs are aplenty.",0,1293100206,null,0,true,0,c1a39yx,t3_eq7a6,t1_c1a39yx,t3_eq7a6,null,1426648944,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I was working on an 18 month contract in the Western Isles (beautiful place to visit) and when it finished I was offered a mini extension of doing up to 12 plans for local crofters and getting paid fairly handsomly to do it.

The catch was I had to sign up as self employed so I did it in early November and was told to expect my 10 digit self employment number in UP TO 6 weeks. I phoned at around the 4 week mark as the work was completed and it was time to rake in the cash. The lady on the phone said that it would take longer but had no timescale. I explained that money was tight and she said to wait.

Another 10 days on I phoned again, this time speaking to someone who had no patience for my questions. She told me that it was tough and it was a busy time. I reminded her that things were only going to get busier in January with tax returns and couldn't they do something since it's an emergency. Absolutely not she replied. I asked if I could claim job seekers allowance in the meantime and she said no since I was self employed. This got my back up and it got a bit heated as I told her how could I be self employed without my tax details that HMRC weren't supplying. I was in no man's land and the lady could not give less of a shit. 

Another couple of weeks on and I phoned again, this time talking to a helpful guy but he could actually do fuck all. He passed me on to another service and the lady there claimed it was illegal to withhold the funds I was due and that in fact based on my application it would be late January before I got my details. 

When I had seen the pound signs I was due I booked a very premature trip to Finland which has no cleaned me out, If I'd known that up to six weeks actually meant January 31st... maybe then I would have reconsidered. 

I think that just about sums up the UK just now. It's so easy to forget individuals and to just see numbers. I was on hold for a good 15 minutes each call, 3 calls at premium rate. Easy money. 

No one can help me, they don't make it clear that you'll be waiting this long and the alternative for those who are in my position doesn't exist. Meanwhile the politicians bang on about how we're a nation for entrepeneurs and how self employment is the way to go. All I wanted to do was be self employed for a month, get my tax details, get paid and pay my tax before coming off the self employment things. It sounds so simple.

No individual in the UK has ever been sued for clearing the snow from their drive, path, or the road outside their house.  It is *technically* true that you could be successfully sued if the claimant could prove that you were deliberately malicious or reckless (i.e. if you flooded the street to make an ice rink), but it is unlikely to happen in practice.  Anyone taking reasonable care and showing due consideration for other residents (i.e. not piling up snow in your neighbour's drive) can justifiably claim an *assumed duty of care*.  That is, they were doing something to help others that they weren't obliged to do.  Because they're not obliged to do it (unlike the council who have a *legal* duty of care to clear snow) they cannot be held accountable for their actions.

In other words, if you clear some snow and only do a half-arsed job then it's still considered better than doing no job at all.

To classify the WSWS of just being ""web journalism"" is a reflection of your own ignorance of the work,publications and history of the WSWS.

&gt;Anyway the point is that he was trying to cause a confrontation

What your really disapproving of is the democratic right to protest. You make no criticism of the well documented aggressive and violent police tactics, not just at this demo but every demo that takes place. While you crticise a severely disabled man for exercising his right to demonstrate by turning his ""wheelchair to face the police"", you rather conveniently do not question why police turned up armed with truncheons, in riot gear, with horses, why police continually charged demonstrators with horses. Your lack of criticism of the violent police tactics is not an over sight on your part but a silent approval of violent state repression against anybody who exercises their right to demonstrate against government policy.   

&gt;the point is that he was trying to cause a confrontation

A disabled man in a wheelchair was ""trying to cause a confrontation"" because he is carrying out his right to demonstrate but the police in riot gear, lashing out with truncheons and charging on horses where just keeping order I suppose?

&gt;Alfie Meadows probably would be a better victim

 And what about the 50 other hospitalised demonstrators? So Alfie Meadows didn't deserve to be brutally attacked by the cops but a man in a wheelchair did? You fail to see the consistent and endemic pattern of violent police behavior at not only this demo but at every demo.

I don't deny that there were incidents where police action was disproportional, nor have I claimed otherwise in this case. But I don't care for this one-sided victim bullshit where protesters provoke police then claim brutality when they get hit on the head with truncheons.

There is wrong on *both* sides, and both sides have a responsibility to exert self control.

Peaceful protest is a corner-stone of our democracy, but when protesters get frustrated that passive action isn't producing results and start breaking the Treasury windows, or storming Milbank Tower (btw did you know Jody was one of those who made it to the roof?), escalation of police response is sadly inevitable.

A big problem is that Britain really does love misery, it's part of the national character I think.

You 'don't care' that a severely disabled man in a wheelchair is violently attacked twice by cops...says a lot about the basis of your argument.

&gt;Peaceful protest is a corner-stone of our democracy, but when protesters get frustrated that passive action isn't producing results 

As you correctly point out, the tactic of ""peaceful protests...isn't producing any results"" and consequently ""protesters get frustrated"", so the question you should be asking is who is ignoring them and why and also why are ""peaceful protests attacked"".

&gt;escalation of police response is sadly inevitable

You turn reality on its head, you yet again attempt to justify police violence against peaceful democratic demos (something which you just denied), the ""kettling"", baton attacks and charges with horses occurred well before any reaction from the students. These tactics are not just exclusive to the recent student demos but are always used by the police at any demo.

If peaceful protest  ""isn't producing results"" then what are people to do? Just accept a battering from the police and being ignored by the politicians? Your statement ""Peaceful protest is a corner-stone of our democracy, but when protesters get frustrated that passive action isn't producing results"" is recognising the undemocratic nature of the state we live in and is in it self grounds for civil disobedience to fight for democracy. How can you claim we live in a democracy if demonstrations are just ignored and violently attacked by cops or  as you say not ''producing results""...you just expect people to carry on with their peaceful demos, get battered and get ignored?

And yes you are questioning the right to demonstrate. You approve as long as its peaceful and doesnt achieve anything and is subject to police violence...those days are other, have a look in Spain, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Ireland and yes your bastion of ""democracy"" the UK.

Edit: it's very symmetrical, might it be CGI?

I notice also the big windows, uncharacteristic; further the large trees growing near to the older central part would be causing some root damage which is quite dangerous to older buildings with poor foundations (some British cathedrals were built without foundations at all!).

&gt;**A Wasted Life**

&gt;Entertaining stuff from El-Hadji Diouf this morning - as we're sure you've already read.

&gt;In the midst of rather oddly comparing Jamie Carragher to a selection of table condiments, a priceless pot/kettle moment when he claimed Carra ""just loves to talk"" and accusing his nemesis of being ""jealous"" of him, Diouf came out with this gem:

&gt;""I took my country to the World Cup and to the finals of the African Nations Cup.

&gt;""So Carragher can't criticise me because, to me, he has done nothing with his life.""

&gt;Honours won by Jamie Carragher: Two FA Cups, two League Cups, one UEFA Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, two Community Shields and, of course, one Champions League.

&gt;Honours won by El-Hadji Diouf: One League Cup and a £5,000 fine for spitting at a Celtic fan.

&gt;Also, we enjoyed this bit from Diouf's diatribe: ""Carragher doesn't sell papers, Carragher doesn't sell shirts.""

&gt;Hmmmm. According to figures released in August about shirt sales both internationally and domestically, Carragher was in the top ten for the 2007/8 and 2009/10 seasons.

&gt;Diouf, it seems, was not placed.


&gt;**And While We're On The Subject**

&gt;From The Sun's treatment of the above story:

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"&gt;You 'don't care' that a severely disabled man in a wheelchair is violently attacked twice by cops...says a lot about the basis of your argument.

This, right here, is your problem. Regardless of what happened to him, what does it matter if he's disabled? Equality is not a one-way street; a disabled protester getting hurt is no different from an able-bodied protester getting hurt, particularly if the individual knowingly put themselves in harms way in the first place. Jody is a campaigner for equality. He even pointed out in the interview there were other protesters far more deserving of sympathy then him. What more do you want?

&gt;As you correctly point out, the tactic of ""peaceful protests...isn't producing any results"" and consequently ""protesters get frustrated"", so the question you should be asking is who is ignoring them and why and also why are ""peaceful protests attacked"".

It is the right of of the people to protest, but not to force the Government to obey their demands. You seem confused on how democracy works; peaceful protest is the right of the people to object to Government policy, not to make it. The choice the people make is at the ballot box, not in angry mobs on the street.

&gt;You turn reality on its head, you yet again attempt to justify police violence against peaceful democratic demos...

Yes, breaking windows, smashing up buildings, hurling rocks at police. These are the actions of peaceful individuals forced to violent confrontation by the evil police? Grow up. These are the actions of angry young men lashing out at the nearest authority figures.

&gt;And yes you are questioning the right to demonstrate. You approve as long as its peaceful and doesnt achieve anything and is subject to police violence...those days are other, have a look in Spain, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Ireland and yes your bastion of ""democracy"" the UK.

Very revolutionary. Again, you seem to think that adolescent self-righteous anger is a replacement for democratic process. We don't live in a populist state, and nor do we let Government make decisions on the whims of pressure groups.

Just because unpopular decisions have to be taken does not mean those decisions are wrong. The whole point of having a Government is to make the tough decisions. And I note you don't actually seem interested in debating the student fees...

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"&gt; No it won't, this just isn't true. The taxes are high here but they pay for far more than people who aren't working.

Hate to [burst your bubble](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5651825/Benefit-payouts-will-exceed-income-tax-revenue.html) but we were on the way to this situation last year. I know this has happened but don't have time to find a more recent update - I seem to remember revenues dropped below payments just around easter but don't have a link, sorry, so I might be wrong about dates.

To be fair, income tax revenues aren't the main way government raises funds for services. Most of the money raised for services comes from government issued bonds, with taxes funding the payments and the gaps filled in by borrowing. The problem is that this increases the overall payments to be made.

I'm not saying that people who are on the dole are taking money from those that aren't, but something's got to give, particularly as the employment problem is getting worse. The good news is that the one thing the tories are the best party for (other than giving rich people more money, although to be fair Labour did a fairly good job themselves) is cutting spending. Unfortunately the worst thing the tories are known for is cutting spending. However, cut we must, the important thing is to identify where it's been cut too far and how to resolve it once it happens, as we won't know where we've cut too far until after the event.

&gt; Also, why do you assume so many out of work are in that position by choice if you aren't? 

Actually this is a massive misconception. The UK is one of the easiest countries in the world to start your own business in, but there's insufficient training for people on how to do it. If you live in a low employment area and have a business idea, the chances are that you're going to be in the best possible place to expand it once it's off the ground. There is always the choice of self employment. The lack of choice is between unemployment and employment working for someone else, not yourself. What we need a social programmes that can help people start to generate their own wealth instead of relying upon the wealth of others to see them through.

Your point about confidence and skills is absolutely important. For the long term unemployed getting them to believe that they can do it is half the battle, getting them to be capable of doing it is the other half.",0,1293117582,null,0,false,0,c1a3tjm,t3_eq7a6,t1_c1a3tjm,t1_c1a3dlj,null,1426649199,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"Nor is it that good when you compare it to the Netherlands or Sweden, but comparisons are irrelevant in the parent comment. I'm sure the NHS is way better than the Somalian alternative.

Coming to your points:

(1) insufficient funding

That all depends on what you want the NHS to do. In fact I'd argue that the NHS will always be underfunded if your goal is free treatment for all that need it at the point of use (as there's always going to be some guy with his dick in a milk bottle, but does that mean every hospital should be filled with dick-from-bottle-removing-machines?). If you define practical and measurable goals for the NHS and permit private insurers to pick up the gaps then you're getting somewhere - I'm not saying that the NHS shouldn't treat people who need treatment for common illnesses, but if you're earning Phillip Green's kind of money should you really get the full weight of NHS support? Should you pay more or less?

(2) insufficient spending on preventative programmes

I'll come back to obesity in a moment but let us look at preventative programmes. If we were to budget on preventative programmes what return should be generated? What is the purpose of a preventative programme - is it to improve people's life quality, is it to pre-scan people for susceptibility to specific illness (in order to help them avoid it, such as diabetes), is it to save the NHS money by beginning treatment early? At the moment the case for particular programmes seem to be based upon spending a certain budget (at least in the three PCTs I've worked for they had an annual budget in which departments would submit requests for money to promote things. The problem was there were so many 'things' it's more or less impossible to get a coherent message out - still, if the money wasn't spent, it wouldn't be available next year).

Obesity is a prime example. We're being demonised for making personal choices. Personal choices like smoking and drinking are already demonised (yet the majority of the country will eat like pigs and get utterly shitfaced towards the end of this year because it's christmas!) and now you're talking about the demonisation of personal choices over what people eat. At some point you have to decide in life whether you support the idea of making their own personal choices in life or not. So should the NHS get the fat police on the go to try and force people to eat better, should they fund education to help people make better choices or should they reduce levels of treatment that make bad choices? My own personal view is that what a person puts into their system is their own business, and that we should treat them the first time, but if a doctor in their own independent medical opinion tells them to stop drinking/smoking/mcdonalds/heroin and they don't, then they should start contributing towards their treatment for related illnesses. That way you reserve the personal choice aspect but limit the burden on the NHS.

(3) - bureaucracy

Unfortunately I've very familiar with this, having worked with PCTs and on Connecting for Health. To go back to number 1 - if you increase NHS funding in general a large portion of it will never reach the frontline. The NHS' capacity for middle management and cover your arse policies is probably second only to the Indian civil service. You will not modernise the NHS without facing this hydra.

(4) part-privatisation

I agree completely here. I'm neither for nor against privatisation as long as it's well done. Unfortunately this rarely happens and there are some areas that perhaps should be ring-fenced from privatisation as their goals (social goals) are in opposition to privatised goals (profit).",0,1293121263,null,0,false,0,c1a4154,t3_eq7a6,t1_c1a4154,t1_c1a37b4,null,1426649296,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I guess the problem is that there is a whole new generation of kids who don't know how the police operate or how best to deal with them when they play their funny little arrest games.

They will try and intimidate you, in the hope that you will either own up to an offense (1 fuzzpoint) lead them to other co-conspirators (1 fp for each name they elicit) and they most definitely will use the knowledge that in court a judge will  invariably side with the law (10 fp) unless there is very strong and clear evidence that the police case is flawed (lose 5 fp) and the court feels its time has been wasted.

Say nothing that's not in response to a direct question.
Answer calmly and politely with yes, officer, no officer.
Do not try and take them on with any clever stuff, they've seen it all before and will toss you about (metaphorically) like a tugboat in a typhoon.

This way you will more than likely be released more quickly and any charges reduced or removed as they will not be able to convince the CPS that there is anything worth pursuing.

It seems that whenever there's not a major story to report on endlessly the media just manufacture a controversy about whoever's said something slightly objectionable recently, in this case taking someone dropping the n-bomb in a joke *about* racism and reporting it out of context as a racist joke. I find this objectionable because it causes TV companies to do stuff like [this](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/6267318/BBC-to-ban-swearing-after-9pm-watershed.html) which could, for example, mean that something awesome like Peep Show gets bumped back to some ungodly hour of the night, meaning less viewers and less chance of more Peep Show. 

So basically I am saying that the media, especially the rapidly disintegrating print media, likes to basically make stuff up so they'll have something to report on, which I wouldn't mind except it damages the careers of people who have basically done nothing wrong (except possibly not being that funny) and just generally makes everything a bit more watered-down and shittier.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I for one would like to see him get another crack of the whip, because I believe most people do, in fact, learn from past mistakes. 

Rafa benitez is a brilliant tactician. He won La Liga with Valencia. With Liverpool knocked out Barcelona at the Camp Nou by putting Arbeloa on the *left* side to nullify messi. He beat Inter Milan, Real Madrid, Chelsea, Juventus, Arsenal, and of course AC Milan to win the Champions League. He got Gerrard and Torres into the World XI almost every year. He went head-to-head with Fergie, Wenger, and Jose Mourinho as a genuine peer. 

Unfortunately what let him down in the end was a couple of poor purchases (Aquilani and Johnson are good players, but we needed an attacker), playing too defensively against weaker teams, never accepting any blame, and he was a really poor man-manager.

So while I wouldn't mind him getting another crack at Liverpool, the time is not right now. Give someone new a chance, maybe a younger up-and-coming manager (would love to see the Dortmand manager at Anfield, unfortunately he probably won't leave Germany) and if that doesn't work then go back to rafa.

For anyone interested in Van Gogh, Netflix has [""Vincent - The life and death of Vincent Van Gogh""](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Vincent_The_Life_and_Death_of_Vincent_Van_Gogh/70036122?trkid=2361637#height1989)

The narrative is entirely from Van Gogh's letters to his brother Theo, and reveals both his passion and torment.  There are some really amazing recreations of the scenes he painted.

I hadn't realized that Van Gogh only painted for ten years - and only ever sold a single painting.

true,Hollack,null,null,"Ignoring finances, which seems a strange thing to determine your constitutional arrangements around, there is an argument about effectiveness.

There are, in the main, two types of head of state: broadly executive ones like the United States, Nigeria and Indonesia and broadly ceremonial ones like the United Kingdom, Germany and Ireland. An executive head of state is responsible for policy, a ceremonial head of state is there as a top diplomat and constitutional safety valve. There are in-between ones like Poland and Portugal, who has a head of state which is usually a proactive figure in forming foreign policy as well as being a safety-valve. 

Either way, the head of state always has to be a figurehead for the nation, not just the state, and many countries believe it's best to keep the figurehead of your nation away from policy-making to avoid alienating people over controversial policies as well as keeping a constitutional safety-valve away from partisan figures and into the hands of a respected non-partisan figure of authority. This worked well for King Juan Carlos of Spain in 1981.

Sometimes these heads of state are chosen by public election; others by parliamentary election, others still by heredity. The question is whether they do these jobs effectively. Constitutional monarchies like the UK, Sweden, Norway, etc, already have a head of state who is capable of cultivating diplomatic links and public relations over much longer periods of time than elected presidents (who usually have term limits) and are usually not former politicians (which presidents usually are). What's more, they can and are gotten rid of when they get out of hand (see Edward VIII).

A state visit, the biggest diplomatic treat you can give a foreign nation, is most effective when the foreign state can get the most PR off of it. The most PR value comes with the highest media coverage. I think more media will cover a visit by HMTQ than a visit by President Wulff of Germany.

I'm not so happy about funding (at least part) of the costs of the Royal Wedding, though. They should pay for that themselves.

A president, democratically elected or otherwise, is a bit of a minefield. It's nice to be different in that we have a monarchy.

I realise it might be a bad thing to argue against democracy, but sometimes it works. For example, the House of Lords is not democratic, but the fact that its members are removed from popular politics often means that they have the balls to do what they want without worrying about public opinion. Including vetoing disastrous legislation that the democratically-elected lower chamber wants. (of course, the House of Commons has the Parliament Act to assert its power over the Lords, but it is rarely used)

NESV are saying the right things at the moment, but we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves as to how much they're willing to splash around.

I think this talk of him leaving is also premature. Sure, he might be frustrated by his lack of playtime. On the other hand, he's got a fat paycheck, a place in an outstanding squad that's only going to get better, the very real prospect of CL football next season and probably a league winners medal in the next few years if he stays at City.

true,ImAFriendlyGuy,null,null,"Here's an overly technical explanation... 

Inside the media file you download, there are three important types of encoding going on. The Video is encoded with a video encoder, the audio with an audio encoder, and then those two are put together (""[muxed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing)"") according to a standard defined by a [container format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_format_\(digital\)).

AVI and MKV are container formats and don't necessitate any particular level of quality. 

Both AVI and MKV files support having video in them of different types. 

Some container formats are better for streaming than others.

Some container formats are better for things like, multiple audio tracks.

There are many other container formats, such as OGM for the open source Theora video codec.

Newer codecs may be incompatible with older container formats. For example, I don't think you can pack Theora video into an AVI file, but you can put it into an OGM or MKV file. 

[AVI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Video_Interleave) == audio video interleave, developed by Microsoft in 1992, showing its age

[MKV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroska) == Matroska, open source, newer, less popularly supported.

The MKV is newer, and better suited to modern video codecs. It is more popularly used online for trading HD video.

So that's what the AVI and MKV mean... inside either you can find high quality video or low quality video.

Blink was amazing as it introduced a monster that could never truly be defeated, it played with the time travel in an interesting way and just had a nice horror feel to it. Not blood/gore/shock horror. Actual sense of dread, which is rarely achieved in any medium so A+ to Blink. Empty Child was a great story with a wonderful ending, the performances were great and made me wish Eccleston didn't leave after the first season. It was also Captain Jack's glorious debut and seasons 1-4 of the revival would not be the same without him; not to mention Torchwood (which, was admittedly terrible at times, but gave us more Jack).

Edit: As someone else pointed out, Midnight too was a great episode. No over the top class 42Doxtal Space Destroyers or world explosions, just an unknown entity that met the Doctor and bested him. The episode was creepy and told a great story of how people can act when they are terrified. It also spared me from another episode with Donna Noble which I am eternally grateful for.

Also, I don't wish to downplay Girl in the Fireplace, it is a wonderful episode and one I re-watch more frequently than the vast majority of episodes. The antagonist clock monsters are easily in my top 5 villains of the series and it will be hard to knock them from their place.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ah, sorry, probably didn't make that as clear as I should have.  The Resolute Desk is pretty famous as far as relationships between the US and the UK are concerned (I mean, hell, there are two exact duplicates, and one is in the Queen's palace and the other in the oval office... of course it'd be kinda famous). While it's always floated around the White House, it wasn't used as the president's desk until the time of JFK... which is early 60's.  Because the Oval Office in the picture doesn't have the Resolute Desk, it means that it's pre-JFK era.  Normally I'd not put that in there as a way to estimate the time period, but because the writing of Doctor Who is usually very on the money about historical details, and because the Resolute Desk is well known in terms of British/American diplomatic relations, I don't think they would have goofed on that point.  So, before the time of JFK.

Anyway, I'm thinking this episode takes place around the late 40's/early 50's judging from the car, guns, photos, and everything else I detailed (another thing I just noticed: the style of military uniform worn by the soldiers in the Area 51 shot is definitely from the same historic era I'm proposing).  

Because the whole Roswell thing happened in '47,  it seems to make sense.  You've got the Doctor in the US, in that time period in all three shots  1) Area 51, 2) in the western part of the US and 3) in the oval office... plus the alien... what else *could* it be but Roswell?  The time period for the different shots is too similar and the locations too similar not to be part of the same episode.  [Of course, it could be something else, but what?  I'm at a loss to guess anything else but Roswell.]

That being the situation, the president in question is almost definitely Truman.  Too bad, a JFK angle could have been pretty awesome (especially when you consider that JFK and Marilyn Monroe had a rather famous affair, and the Doctor seems to have possibly married Marilyn in the Christmas Special).",0,1293328428,null,0,true,0,c1abyot,t3_erg8r,t1_c1abyot,t1_c1abuz5,null,1426653058,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

Maybe the only reason he's out there with River and Pond has to do with Area 51 - because that's definite and unambiguous from the trailer.  The problem is that [this shot of someone carrying another old-school gun](http://imgur.com/qGHGi.jpg) is probably from the same episode as the one with the Doctor sitting at the President's desk - same gun, suit, etc.  And thus [this shot of River looking worried with weird marks on her arms](http://imgur.com/2J5B6.jpg) is probably from the same episode too - the set in both shots is the same, plastic sheeting covering stuff.

This ties together everything from the President's Desk shot to that particular monster and to the River/Pond having weird skin markings.  That's all part of the same story.

This seems to be a glaring error on the writers part at the moment as there was no explanation.  My theory is that there will be consequences for the Doctor.  Perhaps ""silence"" will fall because of all the tampering the Doctor does when he shouldn't.  Even the 10th doctor was taking liberties in thinking that time had to ""obey"" him near the end of his cycle.

When I used to live in Little Venice I did the walk down Edgeware road, along Oxford street and full circle back home a couple of times on Christmas day. In 2001 after a particularly bad break up with my ex following the passing away of my folks i.e. a truly fucking awful year, I left my mobile at home and walked it with the landladies dog and a bottle of vodka for company, it was almost surreal, absolutely deserted. I kinda felt like my life had just stopped, and in some respects it had.

Anyway, on that happy note, time for a cup of tea.

(1) Cheap tricks (2) Saving lots of lives in non-fixed-point events.

Now we know the Doctor is not omniscient and finds out about non-fixed-point events like everyone else, by experiencing them himself. He knew about Mars expedition and Van Gogh's death because they are fixed-point events. But he didn't know Amy Pond had been waiting for him for a decade. Or that Madame had died waiting for him.

Now after finding out that the Madame died, he could go back in her past and entertain her but that's not something that qualifies as a cheap trick or saving lives. I know he took Van Gogh into the future but that was during the period they were together. He did not leave Van Gogh for a while, come back to find out he was dead, and then go back into Van Gogh's past to change it.

He would have taken Madame out to the stars had he not missed a big part of her life and untimely death. Taking her to see stars would change the nature of her death. It was acceptable in Kazran's case because he was saving lots of lives.

When I couldn't bear to think one moment longer about any of it, I could run away with that mad man in his blue box and escape for just a little while.

When that very old, very kind, daft old fool in a young man's body refuses to stand by while children cry, he soothes my own tears. If I have trouble sleeping -- and I often do, my sleep is plagued with nightmares and I have panic attacks and dissociative episodes -- I just imagine that I'm sleeping in a room on the TARDIS, listening to the old girl's thrumming pulse, and the Doctor just down the hall puttering in the console room, ready to come running if I need him...I can sleep.

When the Doctor fills his life with people just as mad as himself and loves them, rather than treats them as defective, when he adores psychiatrist-biting Amy and manic-depressive Vincent and even loves the Master when that maniac deserves it the least -- it makes me feel right at home. I know the Doctor wouldn't treat me as broken and defiled -- I know he would care about me rather than pity me.

When River told the Doctor to not re-write *one single line* of their painful, crazy, wonderful future/past, because she would be damned if she'd give any of it up, because the experience made her who she is, I could begin to believe that maybe none of my own past had to be rewritten to make it okay. That I could live with it and *be magnificent.*

Here's a video that I found, one that says more than I ever could. I didn't make this, but I could have. The Doctor didn't just stand there and watch this little girl cry, either.

Christopher Eccleston knew what it was like to be at fault for the destruction of your world (something I will admit I blamed myself for). He is lonely, *""lonelier then and even lonelier now""*. And you are right- he loves no matter how they are. Aggressive Donna, maddeningly mysterious River. These two women are the closest to my heart, and the ones that remind me, oddly, of myself. Yes, they're not the ""hottest"" companions. But he loves them despite their anger, despite their tendency to lash out at what pisses them off, despite every maddening imperfection. He loves everyone despite their flaws and scars- there is no one unimportant, no one insignificant.

Ships most likely weren't diverted for the same reason they weren't saved once they entered the clouds: Sardick just didn't care. I assume the ship that Amy and Rory was on had had mechanical difficulties which forced them to try to land.


Can't say about the issue of collateral exactly, but if i had to guess it would be that Kazran Sardick's dad had at least a little bit of humanity in him, so he would allow even dieing people to be frozen for collateral (though judging by the number of digits possible i would assume not only dieing people were frozen).

""not really. you said 'white' which draws a distinction between anyone of colour, indians, thais, pakistanis, africans, arabs etc using the word 'white' also at a stretch, implies white british which would then also discount non-coloured imigrants, and needless to say all those people come in a variety of colours. so no, 'black' was not the appropriate word to use.""

2) They throttled my broadband to 1.9Mb/s, I had to spend 50mins on a premium line (£32 for this call) to get them to de-restrict it up to 10Mb/s (what I was paying for). A month later it went back down to 1.9Mb/s.
3) When I tried to cancel my account (after the minimum 1 year) they made me call a premium number 3 times totalling 1hour 18mins before they ended the contract.
4) The only way you can communicate with these fuckers is via a premium rate number to an untrained minimum wage school leaver in a remote call centre.
5) If I pay for TV I do not want 20 mins of commercials for every 26mins of programme content.
6) The 'knowledge' pack was the most content free, dumbed down, repetitive, low budget TV you could imagine. 'Ghost hunting' and a video of a factory is not science.

The problem I have with that is that it will select for conservative MPs; that is - that people become more conservative in outlook the older they get as the pace of change outstrips their ability to embrace or cope with it.

I have already had it up to here with MPs who are too old and decrepit to deal with modern issues, technology and the very idea of connected society, the last we need is more old idiots who are making decisions based on obsolete beliefs, values and ideas.

What we actually need is a complete overhaul of the education system to one that outputs people who are capable of teaching themselves and remaining relevant in skills and outlook for more than a few years.  Instead, our current education system trains people for obsolescence, preferring to force-feed information (often already out-of-date) rather than adapt to a society where things (jobs, technology, the social landscape) change ever more quickly. Our university education system is still couched in the terms of a 'career for life' - which would be laughable if it weren't so tragic for the people who still believe it. You don't get to have a 'career' any more - you have to adapt to what the market needs from you at a given moment, which is a function of rapid change.

It is possible to mention properties of an object as a group with only one or more of them being relevant. 

Like I said before and have said twice now: Them being in the UK is much more important to their death being reported as big news than them being white. You'd have to have a very rosy-tinted view of the world to think that race plays no part in media portrayal, however, even in this day and age.

Open all hours is just an old phrase to mean open for a long time back when opening hours were limited, often including a half day closing in provincial areas. It has much the same meaning as convenience store. The phrase also emphasises the greed of Arkwright.

Much of the great UK TV comedy has been tinged with sadness, squalor and pity. I would also recommend Leonard Rossiter vehicles Rising Damp, and the original The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, as well the sublimely surreal comedy of priest losers Father Ted.

Edit. After thinking about it, the US had something similar in Bilko in the 50's.

(1) For a lot of people, News Corp is *already* responsible for too much (or close to too much) of the media output that we see and read. So it's not just a matter of News Corp owning ""a bit more"" of one company: it's News Corp taking full control of Sky and adding to an already substantial amount of media-related assets in the UK and Europe. By your logic, we should only really be concerned if, in one fell swoop, Murdoch suddenly tried to take control of a whole heap of different enterprises. The problem is that eventually, a whole lot of increments will actually add up to a sizeable issue.

(2) Sky isn't just some poxy old small business... it's *the* subscription television giant in the UK. That makes it a crucial actor on several key media issues such as the listed-events regime for sport, wholesale channel costs for pay TV companies, and the authorisation and regulation of internet television platforms (e.g. YouView, formerly Project Canvas).

true,SubGothius,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I'd say any events directly caused or effected by the cracks were effectively undone but apparently preserved in the subjective memories of any time-travelers involved. That said:

&gt; [""People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey... stuff.""  
-The Tenth Doctor](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall) (warning: TV Tropes)

Consider that as shorthand for saying you can't try to make sense of Doctor Who linearly in terms of a single timeline that keeps getting revisited and revised like, say, a single spool of master tape shared in common for everyone, which is rewound to some point at which recording recommences, erasing and overwriting everything that had happened beyond that point, or having sections spliced in, out, or together. It's maybe more akin to a massive snarl of tape, where every conscious mind has its own strand which may intersect, influence, or intertwine with others at various points in various ways; all of those interactions can be reconfigured and sections of tape excised, augmented, or respliced; and the only thing linear about time is each individual's subjective experience and memory of a particular sequence of events.

Remember, this is ""soft"" sci-fi, far softer than even the hand-waving technobabble of Star Trek, verging on escapist fantasy and utterly madcap preposterousness *a la* Douglas Adams or Terrys Gilliam or Pratchett, so you're expected to suspend considerable disbelief and just accept it on its own terms at face-value and as-presented without trying to work everything out in terms of a logical, linear, cause-effect progression.  It's a lot more like a dream or fairytale than our familiar humdrum waking world... and that's one of the things we love about it, the awareness that maybe we don't quite fully comprehend WTF just happened or how or why... but we're pretty sure at least The Doctor does (mostly, usually), even if he can't always explain it very well in terms we'd understand.

As Clarke famously posited, ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""  In the case of Doctor Who, they've taken magical plotlines and story elements and represented them in terms of ""sufficiently advanced technology"" (with sufficiently advanced Temporal Physics to match) that we 21st Century Earthlings cannot possibly understand to our complete satisfaction.  This techno-scientific veneer somehow seems less cheap than saying ""it's all a dream"" and more plausible than sheer wand-waving magic, tempting us to try to make mundane sense of it where there may be little to be found.  In whatever terms it's couched, it still amounts to magic, albeit a magic with its own (often unexplained until dramatically necessary) rules, consistencies, limitations, and internal logic, with problems caused by and resolved within that arbitrary dramatic framework.

We only expect the explanations and nods at internal consistency to be Good Enough that it doesn't trip up the flow of Drama and Plot glaringly enough to unsuspend our disbelief while we're watching, even if it's not quite Ironclad or Crystal Clear and leaves us puzzling afterwards. It's a testament to how momentarily convincing it is while watching that you *want* and *expect* it to make more sense upon closer examination in retrospect than it ever really does. In that regard, it's perhaps more like stage-magic than wizardry-magic.

I'm by no means old (:-S Early 40s) but I distinctly remember a time before personal computers - in fact, buying Maplin catalogues with a schoolfriend with a plan to make our own from a kit when the Z80 came out.    I remember a time when air travel was a hugely expensive luxury which working people didn't indulge in (pre Freddy Laker) - and we may yet see such times again given possible projections of oil supply/ecological considerations.  I remember regular power cuts in the UK during the '70s.  I remember when most children played outside unsupervised on long summer evenings without too much hysteria about it.  I remember when every high street was unique.  I remember when television broadcasts were part time, on 3 channels and we found other forms of entertainment most of the time.  I remember when guns weren't exactly commonplace, but they weren't exactly a rarity, and playing with airpistols and crossbows in our neighbourhood without anyone being particularly freaked or upset.  I could go on ad nauseum, but you're probably already bored with an old man's reminiscences!

For the record, I found living in the countryside here in Asia a very weird experience.  It's nearer the equator so night falls pretty hard around 6ish and there aren't evenings out playing football or whatever.  The big celestial light goes out, the pretty small ones come on (and you can see thousands of them without effort because you're not fighting against light pollution), and if you're lucky and there's a full moon you can make it to the local bar without killing yourself in the dark.  Otherwise, pretty much everything stops.  At around 4 or 5am, the birds start singing, and people start rising to do whatever their day's work entails (lugging stuff to market or making stuff mostly).

Enterprising individual ( What, so you like Star trek? ) 

Anything Organic. Organic person, organically minded, organic thinker ( heads up, we all are, we're born that way. ) 

Green issues ( as in you don't like mowing the lawn? ) 

Ability to push things forward ( I can push things forward too, I do it every time I go shopping. ) 

Delegation skills ( you mean you're fucking lazy? ) 

Can adapt to best practice solutions ( as opposed to what, worst practice solutions? ) 

A thoroughly hard worker ( what, you beat people in? ) 

Mindsharing skills ( OK, Gypsy Rose Lee just applied for the job  ) 

A holistic approach ( well that CV just went in the bin.)

true,numb3rb0y,null,null,"No. Well, probably no. English police powers as they relate to breaches of the peace are insanely broad. They essentially allow police officers to do whatever they want. In [Austen](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldjudgmt/jd090128/austin-1.htm), the Law Lords ruled that HRA1998 protection of the right to liberty wasn't triggered because Art. 5 ECHR only protects against arbitrary restrictions on liberty, and if the Met could make a tenable showing that there was reason to believe a breach of the peace was imminent or ongoing, the detention of those within the kettle was not arbitrary.

In terms of the general basis for their powers, it's not statutory (although the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 provides a number of collective breach powers that could apply), it's common law. That's one of the reasons the police power is so broad in this area; the common law in question is so old as to simply be accepted by scholars, there's no specific case outlining the foundation and limits of breach of the peace detention powers, although there's a wealth of cases on specific issues arising out of the use of those powers, and Governments have intentionally avoided codifying the powers outside specific expansions like the CJPOA1994 so as to leave them as vague as possible.

Of course, Austen is being appealed, and while I have very little faith in the ECHR they do tend to come down on the side of individual rights more often than the domestic court hierarchy.

I'll be very interested in seeing the progression of these cases because it seems like they're taking an entirely different route to Austen, focusing on common law torts of battery and false imprisonment and Art. 3 ECHR as opposed to Art. 5. I suspect that their chance of success is greater as a result, because Art. 3 rights are absolute and cannot be limited or restricted for any reason, unlike the aforementioned arbitrariness requirement to trigger Art. 5, although I'm not sure whether the treatment alleged, while clearly wrong if true amounts to inhumane or degrading treatment under contemporary interpretation of the ECHR.",0,1293561312,null,0,true,0,c1als8e,t3_esm2i,t1_c1als8e,t1_c1alh1v,null,1426657676,31,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,31

Christopher Meyer has my respect (I'm an IR graduate so he actually makes more sense) because his argument is based upon empirical evidence.

I respect Benn as a fellow progressive but foreign policy is a lot more complicated than people think at the moment, a review of British foreign policy is needed which I agree with and hopefully Britain can lead along with the UN. However it is evident that the UN essentially needs 'teeth' again.

On their section about 'UK Plc.', that's the fault of free markets, not of Great Britain. Capitalism is a harsh mistress.

The iPhone contracts were pretty fucking atrocious when Apple and O2 were in bed together, the desirability of the phone meant O2 could charge whatever they wanted and the customers would keep coming in, even if the contract was unsuitable.

Unfortunately I'm one of these consumers and my contract really is atrocious for what I pay for it, iPhone 4, 100 mins, unlimited texts and 500mb data limit for £30 a month. I had to front up £229 for the phone as well.

Now her willingness to cheat on Rory would be a bad thing, I think, if it were anyone other than the Doctor. This was the man that she idolized and eventually sexually idolized from the age of nine. He was her 'perfect' strange man from another planet. She even had Rory dress up as him, fairly clearly in a sexual manner.
 
A lot her character development is about her unwillingness to grow up, and this is kind of her last ditch attempt to ward off the responsibility of being in an adult relationship with Rory. She loves him, she proves this, but she's scared about the whole commitment thing, because she knows there's something bigger out there. The Doctor represents this other option to a tee, so *of course* she would be sexually interested in him. There's no sign of her being in any way unfaithful to Rory before or since.

And you have a right to be glad about that, as much as I disagree (although I think it's worth noting that what you advocate *would* remove your right to be glad about it if enough people decided it was somehow bad enough to warrant censorship). However, that doesn't make it valid to claim that because someone thinks a behaviour should not be illegal, they must be okay with that behaviour. Obviously you don't subscribe to liberalism, but under liberal political theory there is a disconnect between ""what I personally think is bad"" and ""what I think should be illegal""; rather something like Mill's harm principle should be used to determine whether an act or omission should be unlawful.

Another criticism levelled against him is that The Daily Mail loves him. A total turn-around from the normal 'ban this sick filth"" that they usually run when mentioning any other comedian. The upshot of this is the sense that anything the Daily Mail values must be worthless. 

The final nail in his coffin is that his rise to ubiquity seems to have been very quick.  One appearence on Live At The Apollo sealed it.  I seem to remember reading that he has done clubs for years but so do many other comedians who don't get the same results when they get a gig on TV.

The reason that it used to take 3 days for paper cheques to clear was because each one was sent down to London and physically handed to a representative of the payee's bank in the central clearing house.

Nowadays it takes microseconds for the transaction to clear, but the banks use the ""3 days clearing"" rule to increase their profit margins.

As weblypistol said, they were hugely popular in the UK in late 70's/early 80's and are a part of UK pop culture.

&gt;*In 1978, ""Rivers of Babylon"", a cover of a track by The Melodians with lyrics partly based on Psalm 137 and partly on Psalm 19,[9] became (at the time) the second highest-selling single of all time in the UK. After reaching no.1 for five weeks, ""Rivers of Babylon"" began dropping down the chart, at which point the B-side ""Brown Girl in the Ring"" was given extensive radio airplay, and the single climbed back up the chart to #2. The single spent 6 months in the UK Top 40, including 19 weeks in the Top 10. It eventually sold 5000 copies short of two million.*

&gt;*The group achieved a second UK million-seller with their version of the calypso classic ""Mary's Boy Child/Oh My Lord"", which was previously a million-seller for Harry Belafonte. On the list of the all-time best selling singles in the United Kingdom, Boney M. appear in fifth place (with ""Rivers of Babylon"") and tenth place (with ""Mary's Boy Child/Oh My Lord""). The single sold almost 1.8 million copies and achieved sales of over 1.6 million in the 4 weeks the song was at number one in December 1978. Paul McCartney is the only other artist to appear twice (once with The Beatles, once with Wings) in the Top 10 of that list.*

Take into account that nowadays, you can sell 20,000 records (or less) and get a number one single. Back then, the market was a lot bigger and competition huge. Getting the Christmas number 1 carried some kudos because it meant your track would always be played at that time of year and be a regular source of revenue!",0,1293730217,null,0,true,0,c1auqsd,t3_etnpf,t1_c1auqsd,t1_c1aui3b,null,1426661879,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

BP's tax would be horrendous but on the other hand it might help sell the Post Office.

It would also encourage enterprises to undo the cost savings specialisation have brought.
For example 100 years ago enterprises produced their own power, had their own delivery wagons and did as much as possible in-house. A tax based upon profit per employee would encourage bringing it all back.

Foreign based enterprises would just ensure only low value work was done in the UK.

If I were you I would look into exchange programs your university might have, you don't necessarily need to tell them you want to go to England to use the NHS, you could tell them you've always wanted to live there a while for example. Otherwise, look for scholarships for English unis that do linguistics (I think a German friend studied that at King's). I work freelance in languages (translation, proofreading, linguist etc.) on the side of my music so yes, there are plenty of jobs in languages these parts of the world but they don't always pay that wonderfully. There are quite a lot of language schools in London from what I know that you might also try and integrate.
It can be difficult to obtain citizenship (my american ex had been there for over ten years and only had an authorisation to stay that he renewed every now and then.) but there are plenty of british women to marry ;) And you shouldn't need full citizenship to get treatment from what I know. (I'll try to remember to ask my friends about it though)
I would definitely try to either come study here for a year or more, or apply for jobs that would give you a visa.

If your still having issues after this, the fault is not inside your house, it's external to your house. BT basically own everything up to the master socket, beyond that it's your problem. Depending on the age of your house there is a chance that whoever wired up the internal sockets used really shit wires, which can cause problems for data, but not for voice.

So by connecting your kit to the engineers socket, and running constant ping logging using something like PRTG Network Monitor you should be able to log the problems and basically bypass all the ""it's your kit"" bullshit we were trained to throw at you.

true,unkorrupted,smith,Smith,"Actually, if you go by [Strauss &amp; Howe's description of generational archetypes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss-Howe_generational_theory#Generational_archetypes), there's a little more pattern.

The first doctor is right in between Nomad and Civic, as was the guy they got to play the him in the Five Doctors.  

The first Baker is right in between Civic and Artist, and the second Bakers &amp; McCoy are between Artist and Prophet.

Davison &amp; McGann are core prophets, but the series sort of runs in to trouble and breaks down here.  

Eccleston &amp; Tennant are nomads, and then Matt Smith is exactly in between nomad &amp; civic again - having come completely full circle and landing in the exact same spot..

* Nomad:  2

* Nomad/civic:  3 - second one plays only one movie (bow ties and funny hats are cool)

* Civic:  2  (still down with the bow tie)

* Civic/artist: 1 (How about a bright scarf?)

* Artist/prophet: 2 - second one finds show on hiatus then canceled (bright bow tie, trying too hard, doesn't make generational sense)

* Prophet: 2 - second one only plays 1 movie, show is not re-started (stupid hippies know nothing of science or bow ties)

So IMO, the Doctor will get older from here, and stay roughly the same age as the later nomads and civics who make up the primary demographic (~12-40 as of 2010).  The ideal age for the character, in order to agree with contemporary generational alignments, is someone who is between 20 and 40 today.  At the same time that age group is too old to play the doctor, the show will have a really hard time trying to appeal to the next prophet generation that is more motivated by spirituality than science.

Does the Doctor's character fall in to this archetype somewhere?

&gt;[Nomad] generations tend to be remembered for their **fast-paced,** **alienated** rising-adult years and their midlife years of **pragmatic leadership.** Their main societal contributions are in the area of **liberty, survival and honor.**  These were **shrewd realists** who preferred individualistic, **pragmatic solutions** to problems. (Example among today’s living generations: Generation X)

And often slightly younger companions &amp; occasional tendencies toward:

&gt;[Civic generations] come of age as team-oriented **young optimists** during a Crisis, emerge as **energetic, overly-confident** midlifers, and age into politically powerful elders attacked by another Awakening.[20] Due to this location in history, such generations tend to be remembered for their collective **military triumphs** in young adulthood and their political achievements as elders. Their main societal contributions are in the area of community, affluence, and **technology.** ",0,1293783823,null,0,true,0,c1axwec,t3_etyq7,t1_c1axwec,t1_c1axcwm,null,1426663375,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

I digress.

In Mexico, Taco Bell is considered American food as it really has very little to do with Mexican food.

For example, those of us in counties with pretty poor public transport shouldn't have to suffer, whereas someone driving and living in Central London can.

As a lawyer, that sets of my bullshit meter. 

To prevent a tenant doing such things it would have to be in the tenancy agreement in some form. If such a provision is contained they knew in advance, or at least knew they were dealing with a landlord who cared about the minutia. If it's not in there they could have just done it and there is nothing he could do.

People will say it's not the same as a personal debt, but a debt is a debt and a deficit is a deficit. We cannot just ignore this, because if we do the cuts we're seeing atm will be a drop in the ocean to what would happen if the IMF was calling the shots.",0,1293833455,null,0,false,0,c1azury,t3_eu6f4,t1_c1azury,t1_c1ayt72,null,1426664318,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;Sorry, couldn't help myself. One has only to look at the obesity rates... And nope, still not an excuse.

wat? What's obesity got to do with taste?

&gt;Did you not say above that people just say you don't look like you're from there? Yes you did. Hence you have no idea.

I'm pretty proud of both my heritages -- shame one of them has a tendancy to alienate me. That can be just as hurtful.

&gt;what are you doing here in the first place?

I'm proud of British food, and because you *really* didn't understand what people were getting upset about. I still think you don't. I was trying to help.

&gt;the French culinary tradition is by far superior to that of Britain by no fault other than the circumstances of bad weather (sorry I insulted your clouds and anticyclone!!) and the history of being an island nation.

Eh? What does island and rain have to do with anything? I mean, I guess the rain means an over-reliance on stews etc... and island means fish dishes in our costal towns are beautiful...

I am actually *really* intrigued by that, so could you explain what you mean?

&gt;Jesus wept why don't you actually hold some pride over all the other stuff the UK has accomplished!

I do. Why can't I be proud of everything? Including the food?

&gt;Is a vile Christmas pudding

WHAT. THE. FUCK. NO.

Christmas pudding and custard is *amazing*. Please don't tell me you had shop-bought Christmas pud and mince pies. :(

(I'm going to put on a tray of mince pies tomorrow, you're welcome to come 'round. :D).

Seriously, though, I know Christmas pud isn't for everyone. I personally don't like black pudding (some stupid Blue Peter presenter once said it was effectively like eating a GIANT SCAB. That traumatised me into disliking the taste).

&gt;really worth all the Marlows, Larkins, Joseph Turners, Benthams, Dawkins, exquisite journalism of the bbc etc etc.

Errrr... yes. :D

&gt;Oh and lastly I'm 99% certain that everyone contributing hasn't actually lived in France and therefore cannot make a proper comparison.

Instead I will reiterate what otterdam has already said with this little hypothetical question. Compare two possible outcomes of this police investigation - one where Mr Jefferies is brought in front of a jury, who has seen the news coverage of this man and have heard about his private life as it is splashed around the news.

And the other outcome being where a man unknown to the public and the media is charged with Joanna Yeates murder, and is subsequently brought to trial

Who would receive a fairer hearing, whereby the merits of the evidence presented in court is considered, not the 'stories' of alarmist tabloid newspapers?

Rather kack-handed comparison I know, but I think it should be explored by all who think Mr Jefferies is fair game. He is not.
