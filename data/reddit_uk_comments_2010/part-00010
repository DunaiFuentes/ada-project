true,ThePowerOfGeek,null,null,"This isn't too unusual, or unprecedented. But it's still a fairly significant sign for this election cycle. Especially given how crazy it has been.

Their comments about Labour's half-hearted (and sporadic) endorsements of electoral reform are interesting. I expect Labour will get more behind that idea over the next few years, because Blair's actions when he was PM have (along with many other factors) have  helped erode their voter base to a critical degree, by making them less capable of winning a majority.

Labour was always strong in Scotland and Wales. And in fact, traditionally depended heavily on Scottish and Welsh seats to get them into power. But when Blair gave more authority to those nations, it invigorated their local nationalist parties, which tangibly eroded Labour support. I think his steering of the party more to the right was a conscious attempt to offset that loss (along with other reasons). By moving Labour (or ""New Labour"") over, the idea was to win over some of the moderate/independent English voters.

But it hasn't worked; partly because the LibDems have picked up more of those votes (disaffected liberal voters) than Blair or other party leaders expected; partly because the decline in trade unions hasn't abated; and partly because he's now competing more directly with the Tories, but without the benefit of tradition and hereditary voting patterns.

It'll be really interesting to see where Labour head after this election. It sounds like hyperbole, but the next year or two will likely determine if the party survives in the long-run.

Banks will be better regulated by Bank of England, who know their shit, unlike the FSA.

The Cake must be shared equally and also be grown. This represents the latter action.

This would be a bad move; lets hope that local people can save Sure Start. This is one of the best things that Any Government anywhere has come up with.

I'm sick of crazy regulations, imposing uneeded costs, for example a contractor has to use a crane to change the bulb of streetlight, ladders not allowed.

I have no opinion on this but understand it. Kent has like over 100,00 Lib dem voters but it is 100% Blue.

&gt;Their talk of renegotiating links with the EU are farcical as it seeks free trade without workers/social rights. It's a non-starter and dog whistle politics. They would also want to scrap the highly successful European Arrest Warrant that helps catch the most despicable, purely because of hatred to Europe, a division they try to hide.

There is a fine line between managers rights and workers rights. Let's hope that we can get a fine balance. The workers should have a right to work and managers a right to manage. 

&gt;They just plain ignore the evidence of projects. If you are poor, vulnerable or sick, they don't care. If you are not, the effects on these people will affect you. And you are only one step away of falling through cut safety nets.

Hopefully, with 'Big Society' reforms, the safety net will be more efficient, better and more effective in getting people back to work. There will be a time lag, so don't expect it to work over night. *They understand that people respond to incentives.* For example people can get a discount on council tax if they contribute to society, this potentially means a lot of things; more charitable work, more healthcare, more policing.

I think it's all a mater of trust. People who believe in their fellow people should vote Conservative. People who believe that government is best informed to make decisions should vote Labour (let's face it some times the government knows best).

I personally would not vote for Lib Dem, they emphasize fairness too much through direct intervention, at a time we need growth.

To take issue with a couple of your points BTW:

&gt; The plan to start cuts early in the view of economists would be a disaster and lead to a double dip depression.

Can you back that that up with references? There most certainly is a danger of a double-dip recession, but what cuts do you say would cause that?

&gt; They will not regulate banks but will scrap the FSA.

That is incorrect. The FSA will be relieved of it's job of regulating banks, that responsibility will move back to the Bank of England. The FSA failed and is incapable of performing it's duties to the level required for modern regulation so it goes in the bin.

&gt;The Cake must be shared equally and also be grown. This represents the latter action.

So the rest of us should pay more in order to keep the rich, rich? While labour have let the rich/poor gap grow, it's pathetic for the Tories to launch attack ads on the matter when:

1) The situation would be much worse if it were not for labour moves over the past 12 years

2) The Tory plans would actively stretch the gap.

&gt;  I'm sick of crazy regulations, imposing uneeded costs, for example a contractor has to use a crane to change the bulb of streetlight, ladders not allowed.

The regulations have more to do with the sue friendly culture that has arrived on the back of no-win/no-fee a m, without the regulations the council would get their asses sued off, now if the contractor ignores it, it's their problem.

&gt;Please expand

The claim that a hung/weak parliament will hurt the pound is dubious at best, yet the Tory's keep claiming it's true in order to scare off potential lib dem voters. They then claim that the current electoral system is the best way to vote because it always gives a strong parliament and it's better to force people to have a strong parliament even if the country is actually divided on the issue.


&gt;Hopefully, with 'Big Society' reforms, the safety net will be more efficient, better and more effective in getting people back to work.

Because hoping that charities do better than government agencies without funding or oversight is such a good way to improve the safety net.

&gt;There will be a time lag, so don't expect it to work over night.

There is a lack of proper policy, so don't expect it to work at all!

&gt;For example people can get a discount on council tax if they contribute to society, this potentially means a lot of things; more charitable work,

If it's goverment funded charity work then i want it to be regulated and checks and balances in place so i know how my money is being spent, infact i don't want it to be charity work at all i want the goverment to be held accountable dammit

wait charity healthcare and charity policing, fuck that I want my doctors to be qualified and my police to be held in check and filling out enough paperwork to make sure they aren't hassling me or anybody unduly.

&gt; I think it's all a mater of trust. People who believe in their fellow people should vote Conservative. People who believe that government is best informed to make decisions should vote Labour (let's face it some times the government knows best).

&gt;they emphasize fairness too much through direct intervention, at a time we need growth.

Isn't encouraging growth at all costs exactly what got us into the economic mess we are in.

Solutions ...

* Allow individuals to opt out of employer provided heath insurance receiving the cost as tax free wages instead.  They can then use the extra tax-free income to buy the health insurance they want, including high deductible plans, keeping the tax-free savings for themselves.  By separating health insurance from employment, individuals will no longer have to worry about pre-existing conditions should they lose their jobs. This massive tax cut for working Americans will not add a penny to the deficit, as the loss of revenue is to insurance companies not the treasury.

* End federal mandates that require insurance companies to provide coverage that many Americans do not want.  Such mandates drive up premiums and deny individuals the ability to choose less expensive plans that better suit their needs.

* Lower Health Care Costs with Medical Malpractice &amp; Tort Reform

Vince Cable is good, no doubt, but the Lib Dems business policies are not to my liking - taxes should be placed on income primarily and businesses secondarily. I don't see the Liberals doing that.

None of the parties or party leaders are libertarian. Cameron has even gone so far as to say he is defintiely not libertarian, as if he even knows what libertarian is all about.

Nigel Farage does identify as libertarian, though I think he's still on the learning curve. More importantly, he speaks his mind and that's something one must look for in a politician. To boot he also has experience in the private sector, unlike any of the others. That's imperative because you've got to know what its like to live under the laws you pass.

When The Doctor leaves Amy with the Priests/Soldiers, he has just lost his jacket to the Angels. When he briefly reappears after seemingly leaving, and is much softer in his behaviour to her, he has his jacket back.

He talks about her having to remember what he said to her when she was seven, but she doesn't know what he means.

Dr:Now, listen. Remember what I told you when you were seven?

Amy: What did you tell me?

Dr: No... {looks pained} that's not the point. You have to remember.

...and then he kisses her on the forehead, which seems (like the rest of the scene) more 'familiar' than normal, and kind of out of character for The Doctor, and then he disappears.

I think this was a future Doctor travelling back to that point in time to speak to Amy. I am now also convinved that the Doctor *did* (EDIT:or *will*) return the next morning to Amelia when she was still seven.

We may even have two seperate timelines. The one we are watching is destined to end in disaster. The only way to stop it will involve The Doctor going back in time to the morning after he first visited Amelia, and telling her something important for later (which is what he was reminding Amy about when he returned to her (with jacket)). This will be the maguffin that comes into play at the end, when she suddenly has a flashback to what he told her that day. This will prompt the Doctor to then go back in time to when Amelia was seven and tell her to remember whatever it was that saved the day. In the future. Um...

true,salvage,null,null,"[Euroscepticism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euroscepticism) encompasses a number of view points but for me  its from an economics and financial standpoint. The EU is a great big black hole sucking in cash and taking out a lot of the checks and balances in the free markets, not just in the UK.

In addition to the millions of non EU workers in the UK there are over a million more from the EU and with Turkey poised to join up, it can easily be millions more. It would be good if the figures were more readily available but when you're in the 6 digits, its irrelevant to my argument.

Its irrelevant because I'm not anti-immigration, quite to the contrary. Libertarian economists like Milton Friedman have taught that immigration is a good thing, when people come to work, their labour accounts for something, they contribute to the economy. My main problem is welfare.  Its no good when people come here not to work but to go on the dole, of which many are.

Another problem, a huge problem is our minimum wage, which is a lot higher than in say poland where its 291 GBP p/m. Compare that to ours which is 1005 GBP p/m, what you get is Poles coming to with the same sit of skills, working much harder, longer hours with much less living expenses as they pool rides and dorm together.

To crown it all, they don't spend their earnings here, they send their wages home to relatives, or portions of it and after a few years go home.

These are a few examples of how the checks and balances are done away with when we open our border for migrant workers without thinking it through. Only recently did we pass a new law requiring them to work here at least two years before being able to sign onto the dole.

Clegg will tell you none of this. The EU was his first job and he likely hopes for it to be his last too. Its envisioned the the EU president will eb the most powerful leader in the world at some point in the not too distant future. The LibDems promised a referendum last time, as did Labour and the Tories, they all lied, and now they're lying again.

There is debate to be had here, there are nearly 200k Brits working in Europe and opting out may complicate things, but where we're headed now isn't somewhere good. Greece and Portugal aren't the only EU members broke off their ass, its Spain too now.

I think not.

However, I have a few points I don't agree with.

The Doctor has definitely kissed Amy on the forehead before, near the end of Victory of the Daleks after she talks the exploding robot scientist down. 

I don't agree with you on Amy not knowing what the Doctor told her when she was seven. In Amy's time line, he has absolutely told her something when she was seven. It's kind of like The Doctor keeps meeting River out of order, Amy has met the Doctor out of order. 

Amelia met ""New Eleventh Doctor"" once while feeding him fish custard. Then ""New Eleventh Doctor"" goes away to come back in 5 minutes.

Then Amelia met ""End of Series Doctor"" later that night. He told Amelia what ""Coated Doctor"" asked Amy to remember in Flesh and Stone. This second meeting occurred (for The Doctor) at the end of this series, when he had figured everything out. But, for some reason, he wasn't able to allow Amelia to remember what he told her. So he had to erase all memory of anything the Doctor did after they meet the first time (like the Tenth Doctor had to do to Donna). This also explains why she doesn't remember the Dalek invasion. Maybe he added some sort of Perception Filter to himself so that Amelia wouldn't try to locate him while he was saving the world over and over again in the 12 years between their meeting. 

So Amy goes on for 12 years thinking that the Doctor never came back. Then he shows up again as ""New Eleventh Doctor"" thinking he has only been gone a five minutes. Maybe ""New Eleventh Doctor"" was even redirected by 12 years by ""End of Series Doctor"" so that ""End of Series Doctor"" could tell Amy what he needed to tell her without ""New Eleventh Doctor"" interfering. 


I don't think you need to invoke multiple timelines if you allow for The Doctor to just erase young Amy's memory of him showing up 5 minutes after he left. We've seen he can erase memory when he did it to Donna. I also like the idea of the Doctor maybe suggesting that Amelia go by Amy from now on, which explains why she changed it.


Although I do like the multiple timelines explaining who River Song killed. Maybe she threw Disaster Timeline Doctor into the time leak to seal it.

Another issue is the archive-building that goes on.  Again, it costs more than it generates in the short term, but it is critical material that should be preserved for future generations.  It is also a long-term project that would be difficult to do as well, if at all, by different entities every few years.

I have inside knowledge of commercial broadcasters and I know that archiving is absolutely disregarded, usually to a few selected events and to the bare minimum legal requirements required by the regulators (all broadcast material has to be kept for a certain length of time depending on what it is; however it doesn't have to be kept in a decent format).

I also know the kind of shit that goes on when the franchise bidding arrives:  regional broadcasters ramp up their news coverage, create extra news zones/local news areas, make sky high promises.

This is true.  It's also why I'd rather see the BBC flat-tax funded, than licence-funded.

I really don't have a problem with this. In my experience (largely in the NHS), migrant workers are coming in to do jobs that the locals find distasteful/beneath them. They expand our economy so that we can aim for jobs of a higher socio-economic status. I think the answer to this is either for people to suck up their (misplaced) pride and do the jobs that are available and important, like nursing and manual labour, or accept that effectively outsourcing to other countries will mean a (modest?) flow of cash in their direction.

true,Gnorris,pertwee,Pertwee,"Okay. Here's my going theory which may simply prove I've *pond*ered this too much :P

'The Doctor in the TARDIS'. The phrase sounds like the title of a fairy tale or an illustration. The kind that young Amelia might have created in the years waiting for the Doctor.

The Doctor, thought to have being ""imagined"" by a young Amelia, is somehow been able to exist outside of the changes. He's real but was considered a fiction for many years, especially by just about everyone in Amy's home town of Leadworth (Leadworth, by the way, is a fictional town and an anagram of many terms including ""Dr Who Tale""). He's obviously come back to Amy and proven his existence but what impact has the creation of various scribblings, dolls and other paraphenalia devoted to ""the Raggedy Doctor"" in the shadow of a leak in reality - The Crack - done? Why is Amy a kiss-o-gram in a small town that could barely have a demand for one - kisses between princesses and frogs/princes are another fairy tale conceit. And is River's diary her own, or the creation of Amelia as a child? You can imagine a child creating that cover if they were infatuated with the TARDIS after seeing it as a child.

Is reality being invaded a by-product of Amelia? I suspect something out there is being powered by imagination, or fictional realities, and is pushing reality out of the way. The Pandorica ""is a fairy tale"" as well. According to River, ""aren't we all"". Where does River's story end? As a data ghost, stored in a library.

Without fan-wanking over the Second Doctor story The Mind Robber too much (I sincerely doubt there would be much point revisiting such an old story for the current production team), there's been a precedent of a land of fiction in the Who universe before. I can't help but think this is playing a part in this season.

""What if we had ideas that could think for themselves? What if one day our dreams no longer needed us?""

edit: Another random thought. If this fiction/rewriting existence thing is at all central to the series, would this maybe mean the Doctor needs to return to Amelia and describe what their adventures will be, so she writes them into existence? Is this what she needs to remember - how to make the story turn out?

The problem with time travel, is that you can re-visit an event from multiple points.

But perhaps that's because on day #180 (in the 13th episode of the series) he came back on the day Amy was met, therefore ""bumping"" the TARDIS from his day #1 of his regeneration toward the future.

You make assumptions of unqualified people - if they are truly unqualified than their schools will fail, be replaced by more efficiently run schools run by more proficient people. This mechanism will inject a degree of competition into the school system. I hope it will drive change through competitive incentives which are proven to be successful (in private industry). It is better than centrally setting arbitrary targets. 

The idea is to unlock the monopoly the state has on public services. Inject competition, get more value for the same money.  

It could fail and will fail some schools. We will find schools shutting down - running out of money - in the worst case scenario. However, after this time lag. They will be replaced or taken over by better run, well managed schools.  This is how competitive forces work - to the betterment of the end customer. I understand it can be hard to envisage this style of activity in the public realm - but it is entirely possible.

Well done for latching onto an obvious exaggeration. 

&gt; Immigrants tend to stick together, act in a group and look out for each other. White people do not this, and you would probably call them racist if they attempted to do so.

Immigrants stick together because they're in a minority that is constantly under attack by prejudice. It really isn't hard to understand why this happens. The only thing Bangladeshis voting for Bangladeshis proves is that they feel nobody else properly represents them, and in a country where a large segment of society are immensely misinformed about immigration and borderline racist, I'm inclined to agree.

&gt; 2001 was before many Eastern Europeans started arriving.

While we may have to wait until the 2011 census for a more accurate report, I'm willing to bet the situation hasn't changed much and that there is still, obviously, a large white majority.

&gt; They contribute for anyone who might employ them. For jobseekers they are unwelcome competition in the job market and for workers they also act as competition in the labour market and so cause decreased wages and a reduction in bargaining power for individuals.

The only thing decreased wages is an argument for is a higher minimum wage.

My biggest problem with the end of that one was the Gadget robot went through a cascade of the Mars Water and they took it into the TARDIS and onto Earth.

true,robosatan,null,null,"Oh come on, there is nothing bad about joining the EU other than irrational fear of giving part of our own governments powers to other countries (most of which would do the same thing as us anyway). But the truth is the EU is essentially a cost saving excersise.

Looking at the economy as a prudent example, historically each country would have to negotiate its affairs with every other country on its own terms. Every time we set to do business with a foreign nation we'd essentially have to negotiate a new treaty with them, trying to impose our trade laws on to them and vice versa. With some nations that could be quite an expensive process, and in some cases even mean that we cannot do business with them. 

Now businesses are generally free to trade in whatever countries they wish, but the security that comes from these treaties accomodates a compromise between cutting cost and low risk.

With this in mind, would it not make more sense to negotiate a single treaty with as many countries at the table at the same time, rather than have them resolved individuallly? (see addendum)

Not only that, but if everybody is working to playing the same sheet of music it becomes even cheaper to run your business. If you know a foreign state addequately certifies its business practices then you know you don't have to run as extensive background checks. For example, if country X works to ISO standard 321 for smelting metal ore A in to metal alloy B (which cannot be found in england), then your company can make substantial savings by not having to send out inspectors and perhaps do less quality assurance checks. In terms of labour, perhaps this decrease in risk would bring jobs back to europe rather than see chips of lead paint inside your chinese made baby formula ^_^

Anyway, I've digressed. The reason why a lot of advocates think we should stay involved with europe is that if we ignore it, well eventually it's going to succeed. Germany, France, Italy and Spain are the big players (in terms of GDP and population) and that gives them a lot of sway in what rules the EU adopt. If we sit aside while they create rules and regulations for its member states, when it comes to us doing business with the EU we **will** have to compromise to their will else they will go elsewhere (26 countries have a lot more bargaining power than england, take the united states for example). Not only that, but we'd find ourselves having to adopt all the regulations and ""best business practices"" they choose, just for our companies to stay competitive. However, if we continue to work with them then perhaps our existing influence can mean that our regulations won't have to changed at all, and at worst only compromised.

That's ignoring the potential the EU has as a forum for other matters. Like bring global warning and polution to the agenda of lesser developed countries. And ignoring the fact the increased bargaining power the EU state has with existing supernations (the US/Russia/China), in the same way the UK would struggle to influence the EU from the outside.

And back to my insinuation that the UKIP are similar to the BNP, well if you think the above makes sense then don't the entire arguements of ""Saving money"" and ""National Pride"" really not translate to ""Ignorance"" and ""Xenophobia"" which are essentially both points on the same axes of ""Stupidity"" and ""Racism"" the BNP are reknowned to campaign on?

And lets not forget the UKIP party's MP's often have roots from within the Conservative party. I happily make digs about the elitist nature of the tories as any other man, so I'd like to make the point that the connection is quite unnerving. Letting my inner conspiracy theorist run wild, it wouldn't surprise me if a number of the parties founders had close ties to people who run successful businesses that are dependant on some caveat of current trade agreements. That if changed may adversely affect their businesses (accepting more eastern european countries in to the union and having to enforce the EU minimum wage etc). But of course that's purely speculation, I'm sure they're all just doing it because they just ""know"" its right and/or for the chance to partake in the glamorous spectacle that is British politics! ;)

Addendum: Just to show how expensive it can become to work in such a method here are some examples:

Three countries A, B and C want to set up individual trade agreements. This requires 3 agreements (A+B, A+C, B+C or 2+1=3)

Four countries A, B, C and D want to set up trade agreements. This requires 6 agreements (A+B, A+C, A+D, B+C, B+D, C+D or 3+2+1=6).

Five countries A, B, C, D and E want to set up trade agreements. This requires 10 agreements (A+B, A+C, A+D, A+E, B+C, B+D, B+E, C+D, C+E, D+E or 4+3+2+1=10)

Six Countries A, B, C, D, E and F want to set up trade agreements. This requires 15 agreements (5+4+3+2+1)

There are 27 states in the EU, every time that an issue should arise if we were to discuss it individually then there would potentially be 378 negotiations (27+26+25+...+2+1=378). Should it be a matter that concerns all 50 european states then there would have to be a combined effort of 1275 negotiations.

Oh, I missed the jacket being there the first time around.  I thought something was off on that bit of the scene, but couldn't figure it out.

My husband and I have been working on a theory - we think there are not two separate timelines, but two actual ""universes.""  

Going on the theory that every decision made creates a universe that reflects the other decisions that could be made at that moment (that I'm probably explaining badly), mixed with certain points of history are fixed, and others are in flux: 

We think this actually goes back to ""Waters of Mars.""  When 10 went a little bonkers and changed history the way it wasn't supposed to, he created a near fatal flaw in the laws of time.  When the 11 had to take a ""quick trip"" in the TARDIS when Amelia was 7, he crossed the border between universes through the crack in Amelia's wall.

the reason why he's constantly late, Amy can't remember certain things that he is sure of and items are always ""wrong"" is because he's on the wrong side of crack.

We're speculating that in order to save the universe, he'll have to destroy the one he created in error.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Did you just get here from the 1950s in a TARDIS ? You have ? OK. A few things need explaining, now that you have become familiar with the ""Internet"".

Grammar schools, to all intents and purposes, no longer exist in 21st century Britain. They were replaced starting from the 1960s by comprehensives. Comprehensives are a bit like old Soviet factories (the Soviet Union doesn't exist any more either, by the way - no more Red Scare, yay !) in that they are managed top-down, inefficient, and produce products of uniform low quality. 

Sure there are *good* comprehensives, if Mummy and Daddy have money to move to a catchment area that happens to contain one, because that's one of the things that determines property prices nowadays.

Otherwise, if you live in a sink estate, little Johnny will end up in some ideologically-driven, bureaucratically micro-managed Lord of the Flies shithole with a successful literacy rate somewhere in the region of rural Ghana.

Why did comprehensives replace the old grammar/secondary modern system ? There are lots of theories, but probably because it suited the two major UK political parties.

The Tories liked it because it guaranteed that the oiks had very little chance to climb out of the working class. Crippling the education system kept them in their place. Compare Cameron's cabinet-in-waiting with Thatcher's - where Maggie, herself a grammar school girl, had people like Tebbit and Major, working class boys, Cameron's cabinet looks like a toff's biscuit game party. The patricians never really liked Thatcher and her lower-middle-class ilk in their party, and now they are back in control.

Labour liked comprehensives even more for two reasons. First, it pleases the ideologues who believe in absolute equality against all rhyme and reason, and second, as the Tories, they wanted a system that keeps the working class in their place. The last thing Labour wanted was people going to grammar school, getting an education, leaving the lower classes and not voting Labour any more. Of course their *own* children go to private schools or comps in the very best areas.

The end result ? Social mobility has all but collapsed since the 70s, everyone's happy. Unless you had the misfortune to go to one of these comprehensive ""schools"", of course.",0,1272895438,null,0,false,0,c0pc5fk,t3_bz407,t1_c0pc5fk,t1_c0pbvu0,null,1426296012,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Totally disagree.
Many schools are worse than useless. Having home educated my eldest and sent the youngest to school at 5, I can say that the difference is criminal. The worst thing I ever did was sending her to school.
My own schooling was largely a process of humiliation and being held back academically in various 'Lord of the Flies shitholes' (comprehensives).
Success in the school system relies on the family instilling the right attitude in the child at an early enough age, so that it doesn't get totally knocked out of them at school.

It is illegal for a museum to choose not to hire someone based on their religious beliefs. The difference is as above: if it interferes with their ability to do the job (for example if they are there in an educational capacity to inform tours about natural history, but they instead espouse creationism) then they will lose their job.

&gt; Again, discrimination isn't the same as segregation

Segregation is discrimination, discrimination is the root cause of segregation. Any amount of discrimination causes an amount of segregation.

Because you're unable to understand issues outside of your world, I'm more than happy to bet that you are a white male (the privilege is inherent). I'm getting good odds on this, trust me.

&gt; A business that turns away custom is less competitive than one that doesn't. An employer who turns away the most talented employees is less talented than one that doesn't. Less competitive businesses fail.

This may be true, but you're ignoring what I said. Just because these are, by their very nature, detrimental to both business and society, it does not mean we should not make it law, because there will always be those who will do whatever they like to keep minorities in their place.

&gt; I simple believe freedom of consience is a human right.

Human rights do not extend to businesses, as they are not human.

&gt; Apartheid is legally enforced segregation. There's a massive difference between that and individuals choosing who to do business with.

As before, any discrimination causes segregation. Legally acceptable discrimination is legally enforced segregation. The only difference is in the wording. They both end the same way.

Try standing up for the rights of individuals instead of this pathetic brown-nosing of business.

A lot of companies are internationally based (Banks, Supermarkets, retail and the majority of industry finds it's raw materials outside our borders), expecting them not to be heavily influenced by regulations passed within the EU when these supercompanies find themselves making a large portion of their profits outside our borders is extremely naive. We should help lead europe, not end up being led by them.

&gt;What it really comes down to is this, we in the UK exploit a lot more than than our fare share of the planet's resources, we're richer and better placed in the markets than most other EU members.

And we will continue to be better placed in all of those markets than most other EU members. Why? Because we're there already. Just like how France and Germany continue to be extremely successful even though they are full members of the union.

&gt;As it is now with the millions of EU migrants working here on our minimum wage but below our standard of living, as well as collecting welfare checks, they're gaining more than we do, especially those who save their money to go back home with, which most do.

I agree that would be a problem IF it were actually a problem. You see, aside from the recent influx of unemployment due to hiccup in the economy there has been little change in the unemployment rate in recent history. The rising figures are mainly down to the population increasing naturally (10% of 100 is less than 10% of 1000). Perhaps there has been a worrying decrease in the number of apprenticeships available each year. But then we've seen increases to the age of retirement, people living longer healthier lives and this mean we aren't just filling old jobs with new faces we're having to create new jobs to accomodate a large portion of school leavers.

Why is this relevant? Well, if those nasty immigrants were coming here and stealing all our jobs because they'll work for a cheaper rate, then wouldn't we see unemployment raise proportionately to immigration? Well to my knowledge it doesn't, and the only parties that claim it is are the UKIP and BNP. I'm hessitant to use the following link considering your next point, but it's the most [appropiate article based on external data](http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=20351).

&gt;Now you may be part of some socialist movement that seeks to divide up the world's resources equally in thin slivers for each human inhabitant, but you ought to know it won't work. As you pointed out yourself there are special interests, super rich people. And just think of it, you're most likely quite rich yourself compared to most people in Poland, Latvia and other East European countries.

Rofl, socialism is horrible, our socialist healthcare, police force, fire service, local maintenance groups and essentially our government are all terrible terrible socialist things. Not only that, but I whole heartedly think nations should continue slave labour by manipulating foreign economies and exploiting their work forces. After all, it's not slavery unless we bring them here!

Do you have any idea how unbelievabley racist you sound? My dental practice just got taken over by a polish couple, why? There's shortage of dentists wanting to work in my area and shock horror they're qualified dentists. Just because somebody is from Poland or Lativia or any of the eatern european states shouldn't mean they are lesser people not worthy of my money. Like all the candidates at the prime ministerial debates said, if people want to come to england to work and pay taxes, and won't put a strain on employment for UK nationals then they are and should always be welcome to come here. 

You make out like every person allowed in to the country is here to seek benefits. The reality is, most of them come here to work and of the immigrants that do come here and end up on benefits the majority are assylum seekers and they only make up a small fraction of people that make it in to the country.

This is why brown made a passing remark about that woman being bigoted. There's a massive and unfounded stigma about immigration that is largely false. She had prejudged all immigrants based on the bad reputation of a minority of them and that in essence is bigotry.",0,1272906881,null,0,false,0,c0pck0j,t3_byqa5,t1_c0pck0j,t1_c0pbvie,null,1426296227,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
true,robosatan,null,null,"&gt;Then there is Turkey which may join up soon, that will bring in another few millions, and if you're already not feeling the affect of EU workers in your local job market, you're sure to see this one coming. Only, it will be too late then for though you can change your mind, you will have given rise to a real populist movement with very unhealthy cultural characteristics, even racist.

Firstly, to become a member of the EU is not something that just happens. Your country has to meet a number of criteria in policy that nations within the EU have agreed on in the [Acquis Communartaire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquis_communautaire). Essentially it's a document that defines how developed a nation must be before they can be considered for EU membership. [Here is how turkey currently stand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Turkey_to_the_European_Union#Status_of_the_acquis_chapters) on being accepted, all of those must turn green or have exceptionally good reason why they cannot be changed. As you can see, as of 2006 when Turkey last negotiated it's ascension they pretty much failed on all fronts.

And even should Turkey meet the criteria the EU sets, they must then be unanimously voted in to the EU. Should only a single country disagree then they won't be accepted in. At the moment, a large portion of the wealthier countries in the EU see turkey as a potential landmine. And until they see a vast improvement in Turkeys politics, they aren't going to let them in to the EU.

So yes, Turkey could join the EU as soon as 2013. But unless a miracle happens, and by miracle I literally mean an event of divine nature, then it won't get in. If you believe they could then you really don't understand what the EU is and will continue to be.

&gt;So there is that, but there is the statement you made ""irrational fear of giving part of our own governments powers to other countries"" which betrays either a certain ignorance or tyranny if you're a politician for a nation's sovereignty is not yours to give away. And even if this was on the back of a referendum that made this legal, you really think central planning works? How old are you?

The EU isn't a government as such, it's a stakeholders meeting for international policy. Laws are rarely passed at the EU level, just agreements and directives to facilitate a better standard of life and business for its members. And anything that is passed as Law is done so because its essentially accepted by all the member states already, there just isn't any way to enforce it actually happens (just as criminal law changes to meet the requirements of the times).

That said, we are a big influence in europe. The little power we have already given up, has greatly increased the power we have to dictate what other countries do themselves.

As you said, it's not our politicians power to give away and there should be a referendum before we further intergrate with europe. To my knowledge Labour and the Lib Dems both agree that we should look to join the EU when the time is right. However I think it's worded that not because they think now is a bad time to join, but because if they held a referendum, it would never get passed due to the ignorance of the masses that are allowed to vote on the subject. In essence advocating a referendum when nobody is interested in joining would be political suicide, just as attempting to get our country to join without referendum.

I'm all for democracy, I think the right for everybody to vote is a fantastic thing. But I feel that a lot of people aren't voting on things they fully understand. They're ability to think freely and in their best interests is corrupted by media scare stories that take things out of context. Take the Greek economy for example, do you think europe would just stand by and watch it crumble if it weren't for the EU? I doubt it very much. It wouldn't surprise me if countries outside the EU with interests in greek business have also loaned them money to try and stabalise their economy. However the media have gone to great lengths to make out that the EU is some kind of piggy bank that struggling european nations can always turn to. Completely missing the point that perhaps those countries aren't loaning money because of the EU, but because their individual country has interests in Greece.

As for your question about whether central planning works, I'd have to say yes I think it's fairly apparent that it is important at least to some degree. I'll jump the gun here and assume your raising the point because you think it isn't. To that I would firstly like to ask, do you think the central planning that we're going to vote on thursday works? And secondly, do not see how important international stability is for individual countries?

To elaborate on the latter question, I'll go back to the greek economy. Do you agree that adverse events to the greeks can also impact a number of other european states? And do you agree that the EU could have done a better job in instigating better directives to have avoided this crisis all together or at least lessened its impact to a more manageable level? 

Personally I think both are true. While I have no idea what british buisinesses are directly tied with the greek economy, it's not hard to imagine a rippling effect that will actually affect us. I also think the EU could have done a better job in protecting us from having to pay out billions to save their economy, but I also appreciate the EU is a realtively new thing. There is still a lot of work to be done in fine tuning it to benefit everybody, but that will never happen if at the first sign of trouble countries begin to jump boat.

The world isn't like it was 100 years ago. International business is becoming much more common. It's not unheard of for small to medium sized businesses to have initiatives set up in a number of countries. You can't just bury your head in the sand and say that you only care about the ones based in your own nation any more. You only have to look back 12 months to the banking crisis to see how true this is.

The EU is the way forward, the sooner we get more involved the better and frankly, anybody who disagrees either doesn't understand how the modern world works (lets call them the voters) or simply driven by greed (lets call them the explotative businessmen, aka tories).

While on one hand you have people who have no doubt earned their riches through some degree of ingeniuty. You also, have families of potentially very capable heirs, at least judging by the success of their predecessors that can potentially be led in to a life of laziness just living off their parents success.

Now I have no doubt that we've all fantasized about the latter scenario at some point in our lives, but the fact is money that gets tied up in such a way can have a negative impact on the country. Somebody earns 10 million through hard work that most likely improved the economy and then it gets handed down from generation to generation without ever being reinvested. That's where I see the inheritance tax become productive because the heirs are more likely to become invested in being equally successful.

If your family will lose 20% of their inheritance they are more insensed to continue that legacy of successful business. And be more likely to capably fill the void of the decesased family member.

Lets face it, while in an ideal world joe blogs can go from rags to riches the majority of success stories don't t work that way.

Prior to this, exterior shots of the TARDIS landing had implied that the ship appeared soundlessly in a new environment. Although the precise sound of ""re-materialization"" — with its distinctive, final ""thud"" — would not be finalized until The Three Doctors, this was the start of a sometimes important convention about the TARDIS. People on the outside can hear it coming and going. Without this innovation, the teaser from The Christmas Invasion, for example — in which Jackie and Mickey respond solely to the sound of the TARDIS — wouldn't have been possible.

Even the idea that all the things we thought were just statues were actually an army of Weeping Angels was scary. But for some reason once they were all able to move around, they stopped being scary.

I think what's happening is that people mix RTD's stint as a writer on Doctor Who with his duties as the show's head.

As a writer, he was good but not great.  Most of his actual stories were either potboilers (Midnight, Gridlock, The Long Game, Boom Town) or the Deus-Ex-Machina Raganrok finales that became self-parodies as time went on.

But as the head of the show, he was responsible for some great changes:

  * He brought the show back, of course.  That's a lot on its own ;)
  * He gave the companions actual backstories.
  * He made the relationships between the Doctor and his companions more realistic.
  * He brought many good scriptwriters on board (Moffatt, of course; and I'd love to see Cornell and Shearman both show up again).
  * He understood the role of humor in the show
  * He mostly got rid of the endless loops of the Doctor or companion getting captured, rescued, chased, captured, rescued to pad the story to N episodes.
  * ...and, *no* question marks on the lapels.  Yay!

What I liked: the Doctor testing by turning off his flashlight, the angels living through images.

What I didn't like: Most of what's already been said. A big thing I thought was an amazing twist was the angels not moving as long as even the viewers could see them (sort of adds to that living through images thing, right?) and so to have that thrown out, almost, by us seeing them move totally killed fear for me. I had to fear them before because I too was watching and not blinking...but after that, nope. The angels not weeping also lost some effect - not being able to see their face is a pretty dramatic thing, I think. Also, the angels not freezing each other - especially since that was how the Doctor trapped the original 4 we saw.

We were told time and again that the angels were acting differently because they were absorbing radiation from the ship, and that their behavior had changed because their goals were different.

And if you want to nitpick, the 'quantum lock when observed' thing made absolutely no sense, because you can blow up a statue.  I still have no idea what the clerics were trying to accomplish by shooting at the statues.

Plus, in this episode they were in a forest with flickering lights.  Any 'quantum locked' statue would not have to remain so for long.

Clearly, the crack is more than Bad Wolf, because it was an actual plot point in the episode.

Bad Wolf was just ""Oh yeah, I've been seeing those words everywhere.  What do they mean?  Oh, it all referred to **X**, for which there was no foreshadowing or justification outside of the finale.

He is for the flickering idea but I am totally against it.

There is too much ambient light for any kind of strobe to be obvious or meaningful as far as the rules of the Angel's movement is concerned. Even if there is a flicker of light, when the light flickers off there is *still* light enough to see the angel. The animation for the angel moving is smooth and obvious. 

When you are trying to convey an idea or point visually it's usually best to be fairly clear about it. If the point of that scene was to scare the audience and show a neat strobe-move effect, then there would have been pitch darkness and *one* light source flickering on and off. The angel's movements would have been clearly jerky. Like in science camp as a kid or a rave as a fucked up kid. 

The point of this scene is to establish that the *only* thing keeping Amy alive is the angel's assumption that she *can* see them so they are holding still. They *move* while on camera to show the audience that the angels are catching on to the fact that she can't see. 

I would have preferred to never see them move at all but there is no way we only think we see them move because of some special lighting that *only occurs at that particular scene*. If you pay attention you will see that the lighting is constant because of the *Crack*. There is always a source of light, be it the crack or the failing ship lights.

The crack was a plot point in the episode. In fact it was the Deus Ex Machina that people bitch about RTD using. 

The problem with the angels has been dealt with better by others elsewhere.  You can put in whatever lines of dialogue to excuse it you want, but it's still a massive change in the nature and power of the angels.  Suddenly you can't look in the eyes of the angel. In Blink they certainly did.  Suddenly you don't get transported in time, but killed. Why (other than the exigency requirements of the plot).  I'm not personally hung up on the changes. I liked the episode. But I do acknowledge it as a cheat and add it on to the pile of other flaws I've seen that make me shake my head at this new ""Moffatt is Superior"" religion that's sprung up. 

I have no doubt Moffatt will improve on some elements from RTD's run. He had the advantage of coming after, and having been in a position to sit back and looking at the details while RTD was dealing with broader strokes.  But his run is already chalk full of flaws.  I'm enjoying the series anyway. But I just don't think the Moffatt = Superior stands up to objective scrutiny so far.  Certainly it's early days. It's 4 years vs. 5 episodes, but it looks like Doctor Who's going to keep being what it was during the RTD run. Fun and flawed.

BTW the other 'lazy' technique used in Dr Who is the god in a box screwdriver that does everything and anything you point it at. It also saves the story from poor writing and wraps it up in the time available

Terry Prachett ....

&gt;Regrettably I’m an older believer and noticed something. It’s this; Doctor Who is ludicrous and it breaks most of the laws of narrative.

&gt;It’s a law – well at least a guideline – in writing plays that if somebody is going to be killed with an axe in the third act, then the axe should be visible hanging on the wall in the first act, and, for the hard of thinking, should be the subject of a line of dialogue that would go something like “you shouldn’t leave that around, it could do someone a mischief.” 

&gt;On planet Earth it’s generally taken for granted that it’s a bad thing to introduce into a narrative some last-minute solution that was totally unexpected and unheralded. At least in the old westerns you did know that there was such a thing as the cavalry and so the cavalry turning up was likely. Indeed, if the cavalry were on their way in your average western movie you were generally given a few cutaway shots of them galloping, just to remind you what was happening.

&gt;The unexpected, unadvertised solution which kisses it all better is known as a deus ex machina – literally, a god from the machine. And a god from the machine is what the Doctor now is. A decent detective story provides you with enough tantalising information to allow you to make a stab at a solution before the famous detective struts his stuff in the library. 

&gt;Doctor Who replaces this with speed, fast talking, and what appears to be that wonderful element “makeitupasyougalongeum”. I don’t know about you, but I don’t think I would dare try to jump-start a spaceship that looks like the Titanic by diving it into the atmosphere… but I have to forgive the Doctor that, because it was hilariously funny.

You're simply not accepting the explanations given on a fantasy/sci-fi show about time travel and poorly made monsters, and I don't get why.

The angels in the first episode were starved and hunting.  Thus, they sent people back in time and fed on their potential energy.  

These angels were well-fed, and sending people back in time does have risks.  So they just killed.  Maybe they can't send people back in time unless they're able to absorb that energy.  Maybe they can turn the bodies into more statues in the right conditions.  Maybe not everything needs to be explicitly spelled out, especially when the characters themselves don't know.

People complain that the Daleks show up and yell 'Exterminate!' and get beaten until the next time.  They never change, they never grow.

Moffat changes the Daleks and doesn't have them erased from time yet again.  People bitch about the colors.  (Maybe pastel was a bad choice, I will grant that much.)

He brings back a villain of his that people seemed to love and expands on their abilities.  If all they do is move when you can't see them, they're not worth a second episode.

They were terrifying the first time because we knew there wasn't a guy with a time machine who could go pick up those who were sent back.

And those of us that are sitting back and enjoying the ride are apparently converts in a new religion?  Well holy shit, someone must have pissed in your cup of the kool-aid.

You want to make a comparison, take Davies first five episodes vs Moffat.  Walking mannequins, the last human as a bitchy piece of skin, gas ghosts and Dickens (best of this lot, which isn't saying much), farting aliens (a two-parter, even), and the Dalek who came to love Rose Tyler.

Those were _all_ horrible episodes, but I enjoyed them anyway, because as you said, this is a fun and flawed series.  It just seems to me to be less flawed under Moffat.  I'm willing to forgive ""brakes on the Tardis"" if I don't have to deal with baby aliens made of fat.

You do have a point that Moffat can build on some of what Davies did, but it's not like Davies had nothing to build on either.  There was already more content and continuity there than Star Trek.

She is a member of (and married to a leader of) a pentecostal church which believes in demonic possession and the joyful submission of wives to their husbands. If this was in her book, I would congratulate her on her openess and ask the Conservative party if this is the right sort of person to have as a major policy advisor and head of the Centre for Social Justice. Belief in demonic possession hardly suggests an evidence based approach to social policy. She is part of a ""Training Track"" for her Newfrontiers chuch where she is teaching a class on the ""church as an agent for change and impact in society."" Does the modern Conservative party really want to be changed by involvement with a church ""where husband and wife embrace male servant leadership and joyful female submission."" ?

It would add absolutely nothing to the show or River Song, and would be at polar opposites with the detached, remorseless, ""dissect them for science"" persona of the Rani.

The fact River Song can fly a TARDIS simply means we haven't seen her learning. Considering we're going backwards in time with River as we travel forwards along the Doctor's timeline, this isn't surprising.

I have spent 20 years working with **disturbed people** who society have turned their back on

So what? This is the age old ""but Christians are the only good people"" meme. And again, the lumping of gay people along with these groups? What's her point here, what's she trying to say? ""I help broken people?"" perhaps?

Don't mistake me - the kids I'm talking about are not students. There were plenty of Asian students at the university, and I had absolutely no issues with them whatsoever. I'm talking about the kids. The 12-16 year olds with nothing better to do than hang around outside their houses shouting insults at strangers. Fuck knows if they ever went to school. Most of the time they'd be out on the street playing football, which would usually end when a window was broken... at which point they'd all scamper off.

One particularly memorable night was when a group of 15-20 Asian kids stood at one end of the road and were firing fireworks down the hill at an equally sized bunch of black kids, who I guessed were either from Radford or a neighbouring street in Lenton.

How is that any different than this description of the male wish fulfillment fantasy:
&gt; In male wish fulfillment fantasies, the reader gets to imagine himself leaving home and becoming part of a larger society or story...

Rose left home and because part of a larger story - discovered there was more to the universe than just her boring life. And as far as this thought: 
&gt; For once, she doesn’t have to worry about her family obligations...

I thought family played a huge part for Rose, in actuality.

It sounds an awful like like the author is saying male wish fulfillment fantasies are ok because while the guy gives up his current responsibilities, he gains new ones (in becoming a leader of the rebellion or long-lost heir to the throne), but female wish fulfillment fantasies are not ok because it's all about the female throwing her responsibilities to the wind, and leaving everyone else behind to care for themselves (nevermind that the male would be doing the same). 

Sounds an awful lot like saying a male can just go off and do whatever, but the female's got to stay at home and keep the family, which seems a lot more sexist to me.

true,real_moxie,null,null,"Having, regrettably, read Twilight, I don't think connection the author is trying to make is actually that comparable.

&gt; Far away from here, but not too far, there’s a fairly average girl living a fairly average life.  She’s attractive enough, and she’s no idiot, but, for all intents, our heroine is a normal person with a normal family, normal friends, and a normal life. And she hates it.

Bella could have had ""normal"" but she did everything possible to avoid ""normal"". In fact, she seemed *annoyed* by everything that could be considered ""normal"". As a character, Rose was already much healthier in terms of living everyday life.


&gt; Lucky for her, it’s not going to last long.  Just then, who should arrive in her life but a supernatural mystery man who ushers her into a new, magical life she could not previously access.  Despite his attractive exterior, said mystery man is actually more than a hundred years old, and, for some unknown reason, he enjoys hanging out with this much younger woman and drawing her into potentially-fatal situations.  Our heroine loves it—loves him.

Edward never drew Bella into potentially-fatal situations - in fact, he did everything possible to avoid them. It was generally Bella's ""adorable"" klutziness, or her hated humanity that was the draw to those situations. Generally, Bella brought situations onto her self, quite unlike how the Doctor brings those situations onto the companions. Also, Bella was apparently in love with Edward the moment she set eyes on him. Her every action after that was to win his love, or him, or whatever. Rose was intrigued by the Doctor, but her affection for him also grew over time - which made a lot more sense.

&gt; As their adventures continue, their relationship quickly evolves (devolves?) into a deep intimacy (disturbing co-dependence?).  Even so, our mystery man and heroine don’t actually have sex with each other.

As far as we know, Rose and the Doctor never did. ;) But yeah, don't really know why that's got to be a noticeable concept anyways, except if someone believes you've got to have sex the very second you realize you're in love.

&gt; I think we can also agree that in Doctor Who’s season one and in Twilight, there are some strange, gendered power dynamics going on.  In Twilight, Edward gives orders; Bella takes them.  In Who, the Doctor orders; Rose cheerfully obeys.

Arguably, the Doctor gives orders and Rose obeys because it's such an entirely foreign situation to her that it makes sense that she should. Edward gives orders because he's controlling.

&gt; Edward (the Doctor) fights; Bella (Rose) either acts as a help-mate or waits to be saved.  Edward (the Doctor) controls the tenor and direction of his relationship with Bella (Rose); Bella (Rose) dotes. 

I thought Rose was a bit more useful than Bella ever was. Granted, some of the situations Rose faced dealt more with mind stuff, whereas what Bella faced was all supernatural strength, something she could not possibly hope to fight while human. Let's not forget, when Bella was turned, she was extremely powerful and able to fight now. So, yeah.

&gt; The only major difference there is that Edward is a bit (understatement) more sexually intense than Eccleston’s Doctor is.  When Edward controls his relationship with Bella, he makes it more obsessive—sneaking into your non-sexual girlfriend’s bedroom and watching her sleep tends to do that.  The Doctor, of course, does exactly the opposite: keep Rose at arm’s length.  But both guys decide when the relationship starts, when it will end, when sex will occur (if ever)… everything really.  These two relationships are clearly lopsided, and the power rests firmly in the hands of the men.

I believe that if Rose told the Doctor to leave her alone, and let her live her life without him, the Doctor would. While one might argue that the Doctor is in control of the overall relationship, Rose has the power to stop it completely. On the other hand, the only way Edward would ever be able to stop obsessing over, and watching over Bella would be to kill himself. I'm fairly confident he claims that somewhere. I do know he claimed himself completely unable to stay away from her - if she told him to go away, I don't believe he would, he'd just have her believe he would.



So yeah. There are maybe some parallels, if you stretch, but I don't think the two are nearly as comparable as the author wants to believe.

The country is divided up into constituencies. People vote for a candidate to be their MP and represent their constituency. The candidate with the most votes wins the seat and becomes the MP for said constituency. There are no runners up, the other candidates get nothing.

The party with the most MPs elected get to form a government. If no party can win outright, you get a hung parliament and they have to form alliances/pacts in order to form a government.

Basically, this system makes it almost impossible for the more fringe parties to ever get seats because of the local support that they would have to muster. I also think that it hurts the more left wing and liberal parties because it is so fragmented in those parts of the spectrum (if they came together, more seats would be won).

I think it's the former rather then the later.  I've been under the impression this whole season that she doesn't necessarily want to be with her boyfriend and that he's possibly just the ""best choice available"" or that the chance to adventure and live in the Doctor's sort of world (adventure, mystery, danger) is far more appealing to her (which is a theme of Doctor Who that probably goes as far back as the older Doctors, and is certainly a major plot point of Rose Tyler's introduction).  

Moffat also seems to have a knack for manipulative characters with secretive motives without outright saying such as a plot point of a piece of dialogue.  Most of us agree that the Doctor's happy moments are a bit fake, I recall a few episode this season where characters or the plot was not as it seemed.. it seems to fit that Amy Pond may be more like the Doctor then originally thought.  

You never know, though.  It's important to wait and see how it turns out and not presume too much.  She may really love the boy.  I certainly like him.  He took to the whole time travel, box is bigger on the inside, oh we're going to die a bit better then some others.  If he was at all out of place it should be noted that this was his first adventure, he had a lot going on his head, and he still stole a bit of the Doctor's thunder, saved Amy's life (of a sorts), called the Doctor on one of his flaws, AND kind of thought it was cool to travel space and time.  I hope he grows in the same way Micky did and becomes a kick ass hero.

That said, and I'm likely to be proven completely wrong on this point come season's end, in the last few minutes of the episode my brain suddenly spit out the theory that Amy Pond may be some sort of ancestor of River Song. Could be why her wedding seems so entangled with the ""crack"". Amy doesn't get married, She doesn't have kids (or at least the right kids) somewhere along the timeline River song doesn't get born thus mucking up the Docto's own timeline (and given how River keeps meeting the Doctor out of order, the gods only know what that could mean to the universe as a whole.) Without River song the whole Library incident turns out differently and that screws up the Doctor/Donna timeline which could have wiped out the planet snatch that we already know Amy doesn't remember...

Completely off topic I know and does nothing to help work out what all these ""Doctor in the TARDIS"" lines people keep dropping mean but, what the hell, figured I'd mention it and maybe it's link back somehow when you all start poking holes into it.

Indeed.

&gt;  I'm really waiting for a breakout awesome episode, because I love the doctor and his personality

I feel like the new doctor is potentially awesome, but stuck in boring story elements. He is always great by himself (and with Amy), but needs to fit in a certain plot point which doesn't do him justice.

&gt; I like the companion(s). I just don't like the situations they are being written through.

I keep feeling like ""She knows too much"", ""Give some place for the doctor"", and ""Why they hell are they ONCE AGAIN splitting apart? ""

But at the same time, I read the theories that the Doctor is revisting her past from his future and think, perhaps it will all make sense in the finale.

So, either the finale will make us revisit the rest of the episodes and go ""Oooh... I didn't see that the first time"" and thus, be the best finale so far...

At the stage we're at now the whole of planet Earth has seen more than its fair share of aliens and considering how many times the world has been under attack they should almost be blasé about the whole thing! We have U.N.I.T which to be fair is completely useless and everyone knows about the Doctor leaving nothing new for the planet Earth to experience. Hell, it's been half way across the galaxy and back!

I'm starting to see this series almost as a repair series. Bringing back recurring enemies such as the Daleks was a great choice instead of the whole ""We've killed them forever! Oh no, they're back again from an impossible situation"" crap we've had more than a few times. Killing key villains such as the Daleks and the Master every-time the Doctor encounters them removes any fear of those characters, rending them useless as story elements.

true,FearOfSuccess,tardis,TARDIS,"How is this at all a source of speculation!?!  In both ""The Next Doctor"" and Episode 1 of this season we have seen every Regeneration of the Doctor.  It's FACT that Matt Smith is playing the 11th Doctor.  Time Lords have 12 regenerations.  He's used 10 of them.  

Now, there has been shown to be quite a few workarounds this rule.  The regenerations of other Time Lords have been shown to be transferable and even in some cases (The Master) we've seen that the Time Lords can resurrect a dead Time Lord.

As far as his turning ""evil"" during his last regeneration...this is not entirely accurate.  The Valeyard (who was the Prosecutor in the ""Trial of a Time Lord"" season long serial of the 6th Doctor) was eventually revealed to be ""an aspect of the Doctor's dormant evil...from somewhere between his 12th and final incarnation.""

This can be taken in many ways, but I've always assumed that The Valeyard was not a true regeneration of The Doctor.  Merely a manifestation of what the Doctor could've been had he chosen a different path.

Also, I'd like to address the people who say ""well it doesn't make any sense that he's 900 years old and has regenerated 10 times in the last 50 years.""  Yes, it makes perfect sense.  We have no idea what the Doctor's present is.  When we don't see him or when he doesn't have companions with him then who knows how much time passes.

Explanations have to be spoon fed to the audience well in advance. There's often very little foreshadowing, it's all 'eightshadowing', or worse.

Getting blown up almost instantly by sunlight was lame... they were exposed to sunlight previously when Isabella's dad lifted up veils, searching for his daughter. It hurts them. Painful allergy would be great... the explosion was lame.

The fish guy dropping his sword and changing just before being blown up was also really bad. It removed any actual threat and tension the attack could have and just made it lame. All the Matt Smith episodes have this problem, big time. Even the Weeping Angels were less scary than in Blink. Prisoner Zero did nothing scary, just stood around and waited being useless. The Daleks did nothing scary, just waited around for the comparatively pathetic and Germans to take care of a problem. Very weak. The 'vampires' just stood around hissing, for the most part. Better be careful, or a Moffat baddie might wait at you to death.

My choice of episodes:

1st Doctor: **The Ark** and **The Tenth Planet**

2nd Doctor: **The Dominators** and **The Krotons**

3rd Doctor: **Colony in Space**

4th Doctor: **The Horror of Fang Rock** This is DW minimalism at its best. The characters are literally in 3 (very drab and tiny) rooms where all the action takes place. It might not be to your taste unless you appreciate just acting.

4th Doctor: **The Keeper of Traken** A well thought out alien race with details, also if you look closely you will recognize wardrobe being reused from various other earlier DW episodes

5th Doctor: **Four to Doomsday** This is a turning point where DW got alot more spacy with a step up in production value and it illustrates the companions' characters well.

5th Doctor: **Mawdryn Undead**

After the 5th Doctor, the series gets iffy.

9th Doctor: **The Empty Child** and **The Doctor Dances**

I am against state subsidy of private schools which is essentially what the assisted places scheme boils down to. Furthermore I think we should aim to improve all schools rather than just establish a pecking order of schools whether that involves grammar schools or assisted places as a pecking order will always fail some students.

I attended a state comprehensive (one of the worst in the county not some leafy suburb) and graduated with 5As at A level in sciences and maths, many of my fellow students also did very well with one studying English at Cambridge etc.  so it is possible to succeed at state comprehensives, people just need to take personal responsibility.  

I used to think that Grammar schools would be better but since arriving at University I honestly think that the diversity in the people I met was beneficial to me as a person and helps create a more sympathetic and less divided society compared to fellow uni students who are all too happy to vote tory and demonise those living in council estates and on welfare despite never having met any of them or having any idea of what such circumstances are like.

Don't care what they call the Glove of Rassilon..... oh snap, but it sure as shit ain't the Hand of Omega. No records my ass. Your information is faulty and spotty and you are just straight up wrong. And yeah, don't give me the ""The New Series can rewrite everything"" crap because they can't. They use images of the former Doctors in the new stuff which makes it a continuation which makes the Hand of Omega a huge ball of energy that changes the nature of stars (It was never a fucking box. It was IN a box, and you see it out of the box in the climax in episode 4 of Remembrance, so you are completely wrong about what you think you know), not an all-purpose energy glove in the same way that the Eye of Harmony wasn't something that lived in the TARDIS, a plot point which made the tv movie suck more than it already did. So don't call something by a name that it isn't and you won't get obsessed Doctor Who fans like me writing you long replies about minor points. Plus, my name is better than yours. The Glove of Rassilon fits nicely with the Sash of Rassilon, the Rod of Rassilon, the Key of Rassilon (Source for those objects: The Deadly Assassin and The Invasion of Time) et al. It's not like the ""of Rassilon"" title is any less lore-inducing or awe-inspiring than ""of Omega"" as they were contemporaries and apparently political rivals. *AND* it is actually worn and used by Rassilon (like the Rod and the Sash which he also wore and used, HOW ABOUT THAT?!) whereas Omega has never been known to make or use energy weapons or have other fashion accessories named after him which Rassilon DOES. Omega was (is) a stellar engineer, he didn't (doesn't) develop weapons/fashion accessories.

edit- and for the record I don't think the Hand needs to make an appearance in the New Series at all unless they need to blow up a star or recreate the Eye of Harmony or use it to break Omega out of the antimatter universe (if he did indeed make it back there in BFDW #47 or if you don't accept BF as canon (I do.) then maybe he ended up there again after Arc of Infinity; Omega was linked to the Arc in some way.) Don't try to argue with someone who's seen Remembrance at least 12 times and seen the Three Doctors, Arc of Infinity (first and second appearances of Omega) , the Deadly Assassin and the Invasion of Time (lots of info about the Time Lords) and pretty much all the classic and new series stories as well just as many.

edit 2- Note also, at no time did I disagree with you that Dalton as Rassilon wasn't cool as fuck or that his Glove thing wasn't also cool, or even your main point which is that we will see the Time Lords again and the resurrection of Rassilon during the Time War will be more fleshed out on screen because I would LOVE to see that.

&gt;Also, I'd like to address the people who say ""well it doesn't make any sense that he's 900 years old and has regenerated 10 times in the last 50 years

Well, the 2nd Doctor said he was 450, the 4th Doctor said he was in his 700s (having operated the TARDIS for 550-odd years; Romana insisted that he had lost count and was actually older.) 6 tells Peri he is 900 years old and 7 says he has 900 years of experience rewiring Dalek technology (which he would have started doing at about age 200 or so in his first incarnation). The New Series then contradicts all this when 9 said he was only 900, but in a way that suggested to me that he had simply stopped worrying about his age there. I'm hoping 10 saying ""I'm 903 years old"" was just some shitty writing (The Xmas Invasion was a pretty weak ep anyway) or some kind of joke, OR he said in front of Rose so that number would make sense to her having been told 3 years earlier that 9 was 900.I think the Doctor probably doesn't keep track of his own age very well being a time-traveller and all and I also think he (and the show writers) are reluctant to ever put his age over the millenium mark.

*edit - plus I was pissed off that I got downvoted when my shorter post wasn't inaccurate. Again, very sorry.

You're not the first person to call me out on it, though you are the nicest. I'm working on being a kinder and gentler poster in /r/doctorwho but I get excited because I actually get to talk in depth about it with people who are more than superficially familiar with the show. I'm one of those people who argues his point to death and I have apparently done so here. 

edit 2- also not sure why you put 'minor fan' in quotations. I never called you one. I would describe myself as over-obsessed with DW and actually think I could stand to be LESS obsessed than I am, so I don't think I am superior at all but you're right I do pride myself (uselessly) that I remember hours of DW dialog and minor plot points and I have an irritating tendency to point out inconsistencies in continuity.

(paraphrased slightly) 
Mickey: Everywhere he goes, he has one constant companion
Rose: Who?
Mickey: Death.

When they went off to fight cybermen, he wasn't entirely useless, then by the time he came back at the end of season 2, he was a regular action-hero infiltrating Torchwood.

Jackie was always ""oh noes, the world is being invaded by monsters, but my daughter would be much safer back here at home instead of helping the one guy who can save everyone"" while Mickey was actually supportive.

Strangely, though, he was always better off without Rose - once he moved on from someone who really wasn't that into him anyway, he did get a lot better.

People always remember the ""moping about Rose"" bits and ignore the rest.

Rory, on the other hand, did the ""oh noes, the doctor is dangerous"" and jumped to ""we won't leave you!"" with about zero actual motivation. And the *actual* best bit of the entire series to date was the doctor actually defending himself. For once, he pointed out that it was a bit of a jump to go from ""run away! the doctor is dangerous!"" to ""we won't leave you!"" and if anything happened to either of them, the survivor would inevitably blame him instead of accepting that running back to the tardis would have been a smart idea, like he said in the first place.

true,Urieka,null,null,"From [I  didn’t vote Lib Dem to get a Tory government…](http://www.liberal-vision.org/2010/05/10/i-didn’t-vote-lib-dem-to-get-a-tory-government/)

&gt;I found it a bit annoying when I first heard it - but as this sentiment seems to be spreading - I am getting increasingly irritated by it. In part it’s because I hate that sort of post-event whinging ( “I didn’t get what I wanted so I will throw my toys out of the pram”) but there are more specific reasons why it’s getting under my skin…..

&gt;1.     No one voted to get a Tory government. People voted to elect their constituency  MP (or indeed to stop a constituency MP) and hoped that others across the country would vote similarly (the only way to “stop” a Tory (or indeed Labour) government). That worked in some area’s - which is why there are fewer Tory MP’s than anyone expected. Even if “voting Lib Dem” in one area did stop a Tory, clearly not enough people in enough areas did the same - hence the situation we are in. The idea that one vote for one local MP would somehow stop a whole government is laughable.

 

&gt;2.    This seems to throw the blame onto the Lib Dems when the blame (if that is the right word - which it probably isn’t) sits with the voters. If this nation really cared about stopping the Tories (or indeed Labour) more people would have voted Lib Dem. That would have given Nick a much stronger negotiating position to choose who to talk to and on what terms. Just because Mrs Miggins voted Lib Dem to stop the local Tory, does not mean that Mrs Miggins view out trumps the nations view. And whilst she and those like her might whinge now, they have to look at themselves frankly and ask whether, if they cared that much, they could have done more. Goodness knows I think Nick did his bit.

 

&gt;3.    Actually the Lib Dems HAVE STOPPED a Tory government - or at least stopped such a strong Tory government that they can ride rough-shod over everyone. Had the Tories taken the Lib Dem seats they targeted we would already have Mr Cameron at No 10. As we stand here now, it is likely/possible that the Lib Dems have the ability to be a balancing item on Tory legislation. And even if a coalition doesn’t happen the Tory party will have to listen to its own backbenchers much more than the previous regime - and indeed listen to the Lib Dems- that’s in part a result of people voting Lib Dem.

 

&gt;4.    Perhaps most importantly it’s annoying because Nick Clegg could not have been clearer, throughout the general election, that the Lib Dems would not decide who to talk to in the event of a hung parliament - he would NOT be kingmaker. It would be the people who would dictate it by virtue of which party  had the largest mandate. It is demonstrably clear that the Tories have the most seats and the largest vote share. In these circumstances, had Nick decided to ignore the Tories, I think the country would have rightly been outraged that Nick had gone back on his word. Where were these people-  who are now complaining that they did not vote Lib Dem to get a Tory government - during the last 4 weeks? Integrity matters - and like the outcome we find ourselves in or not (mainly “not”)- Nick has shown to be a man of integrity - and that counts for a lot these days.

true,mmofan,null,null,"Okay, I've been spending WAY too much time thinking about this. I think the #1 thing to watch is who River Song is. The also has to do with the crack, imho.

Mainly because of:

""River Song is one of the most important characters we've seen in the series... someone who is vital to his life"" - Russell T Davies

Vital to his life leads me to believe it still could be his mother or the tardis. 

She states:

""I've seen whole armies turn and run away and he'd just swagger off back to his TARDIS and open the doors with a snap of his fingers"" - River Song

This could suggest someone from the past who has seen him involved in the Time War.

First, I think some people might wrong about the flirting. When he asks about the handcuffs, I found she says spoilers. We originally thought this was flirting, but she's wearing handcuffs in the latest episode and is a prisoner. For this reason, I don't think she's his wife. Though she acts like one, she never admits as much. I'm going to watch again to see if she's really flirting or they just wanted us to think that.

A few things I found:

* Steven Moffat said to think outside the box (tongue in cheek? outside the tardis, perhaps?)

* When the doctor says “that’s a fairytale”, she says “aren’t we all?” - that creates a direct link between them, they are both the same kind fairytale or similar?

* Another important thing I found along with the handcuffs. In writing, it's the little things that count if you are good, and Moffat is good. Bishop asked her if the doctor knows WHAT she is not WHO. Unfortunately, this could open up a quite a few cans of worms.

* If you remember, it was a woman who picked up the Master's ring.

* This one REALLY throws me for a loop. She has the sonic gun used by Jack Harkness.. Sounds insane, but Jack's daughter? If you remember in one of the episodes there was an news announcement that the Face of Bo had a child. That or I'm crazy, but I seem to remember that.


This being the case, I have determined that River Song is the following:

She is Jack Harkness' daughter who was trained by the Doctor. The Doctor became close with her and she betrayed him, stole the diary (possibly killed him) and became The Rani (i.e. the female Master).

Of course that was a joke, but now that I read it, could be true.

Now recently, I also found the following. This leads me to believe that River Song is either Amy Pond, or her mother. This would explain why the crack seems to be following Amy Pond Around.

Ok, pic is a little small, but here goes nothing. This is why I have my theory on Amy Pond. The top is Amy, the bottom is obviously River Song:

http://i41.tinypic.com/i24svc.jpg

You can clearly see that they are wearing the same watch. While this could be a fudge in wardrobe, I think quite a few of you are now going, ""ohhh...""

Remember in the last Tennant episode when he was asked who the woman was, he looked at Donna's mother. This is to imply a mother. This could still mean that River Song is the doctor's mother, but I believe she might be Amy's. 

Anyway, too many directions it could go at the moment, but I believe River Song is at the top of the list.",0,1273611681,null,0,false,0,c0pt2zo,t3_c2pi3,t1_c0pt2zo,t3_c2pi3,null,1426303979,10,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,10

&gt; Meanwhile the prospect of a Labour-led 'progressive' coalition has been welcomed by thousands of limbless Iraqis, torture victims and people whose DNA is now kept on a database because they signed a petition in the post office about a new bypass.

&gt; Abdul Al-Kaleem, a former limb owner from Basra, said: ""I admire the British Labour Party. They managed to progress my legs off very efficiently, while my Uncle Karim was progressed over a wide area.

&gt; ""I remember being handed what was left of his chin and thinking 'yes, this is definitely progress'.""

&gt; Mohammed Iqbal, from Bradford, said that when he was being tortured by the CIA with the tacit approval of the Labour Party he was comforted by the fact that gay people could now form civil partnerships.

&gt; He added: ""As the electricity coursed through my flailing body and the pliers tightened once more around my already swollen testicles, I smiled at the thought of Elton John and David Furnish having a big, fancy party to celebrate their same sex love.""

&gt; And bypass petitioner Martin Bishop, who is now snuggled nicely into the DNA database between a murderer and a paedophile, said he was impressed by the progress the police had made in taking dozens of photographs of his house.

&gt; He added: ""It's all very impressive. They keep my DNA on a big computer and, who knows, maybe one day they can use it convict me for a crime I didn't commit.

USS Cole, the bombings in Riyadh and Khobar, the Kenyan US embassy bombings, and then 9/11, you're right they happened because of the presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia but also because of the Israel/Palestine conflict and America's unquestioning support of the former.

The fact of the matter is that the UK's invasion of both Afghanistan and Iraq has made the country a less-safe place in every measurable way. The war was based on the false premise that there is a shadowy terrorist network led by Bin Laden. This is abstract nonsense; in 2001 Al Qaida membership was only a couple dozen or so mudjahdeen. Yes, there were other groups with which they had ""contact"" but there was no leadership from Bin Laden. The idea that an intervention there would ""solve"" the problem with this brand of terrorism is retarded. We have done nothing but inspire thousands of Jihadists around the world, including many within our own borders.

&gt; The only people responsible for the 7/7 bombings were the bombers themselves.

That's it precisely. Listen to commentaries on some of the first and second series DVDs and they discuss this at length. Film was precious. If you wanted a retake you pretty much had to add ""shit"" in the middle of your line. Those actors who understood the need for a timely production schedule simply worked around their gaffs, including Hartnell ad-libbing his ""mmmm?"" and several gestures to cover his increasing difficulty in reciting lines precisely. Most television actors and no doubt studio staff had prior stage careers before television was deemed acceptable for a 'real' theatre professional. They were used to carrying on with the show no matter what.

As a kid I had issues with every Doctor not being Tom Baker. Looking back, with portrayals as diverse as Davison and Hartnell, I've come to realise that the Doctor can have any type of personality and it doesn't change the core concept. Colin Baker's run especially has a better place in the overall show in hindsight, and having caught up on Hartnell. At the time he was 'un-Doctorish' to me. Now seeing things in the broader context, he is as much the Doctor as any other portrayal.

Long term fans can probably rationalise this more than new fans. We've had irritable, angry, eccentric, romantic, bumbling, kindly and mysterious Doctors (in no particular order). Seeing any of these traits in the current performance reminds us of one or another of the previous portrayals. ""Oh look Matt Smith is being arrogant. He's doing Colin Baker"".

As to the companions, I agree. Martha was fantastic, and Amy Pond is also great. Not having a Who romance is fantastic.

What I'd most love to see is something like the older historical episodes, where the 'monsters' were just _humans_.

But over the course of the series, the companions all brought something the Doctor needed. Sarah Jane Smith was a moral compass, Lela (and Ace) was powerful and independent, Romana was a Time Lady, Adrick was clever, etc.

The thing I like about Matt Smith's portrayal is that he reminds me of Tom Baker, with the odd mannerisms. He also isn't sure of himself, consider these classic Who quotes that I can see coming out of Smith's Doctor:

* ""Just touch these two strands together, and the Daleks are finished. Have I that right?"" The Doctor, in ""Genesis of the Daleks""

* ""There's no point in being grown-up if you can't be childish sometimes."" The Doctor, in ""Robot"" 

* ""My memory is getting poor. 300 years ago I would have recognized this like a shot."" The Doctor, in ""The Android Invasion""

* &lt;looks at his palm&gt; ""I know this TARDIS like the back of my hand."" &lt;Leela turns the Doctor's hand over&gt; The Doctor, in ""The Invasion of Time""

The most glaring one is that the Daleks we've seen since season 27 have mostly been impure Daleks created from human DNA or reconstituted from Davros's (which being closer to Kaled DNA would make them almost true Daleks but not close enough. Remember, Davros's Imperial Daleks were at war with the original Daleks because of DNA purity issues) The DNA from the Progenitor device was ORIGINAL Dalek DNA, so now they embrace being WHAT THEY WERE TO BEGIN WITH (which makes your point completely wrong; plus I think the new casings look like the Pertwee-era casings from Planet of the Daleks and Death to the Daleks. The pastel colors were a bit much, but I bet when we see them again we'll see armies of grey Daleks like we did in the old days and all (most? some?) of us oldschool Whovians will dig it). I agree with you about the whale thing; worst episode this season so far. The Angels had different motives and needs in this last story and so their behavior was different. They were *using* Amy, not trying to feed on her so they used an ability we hadn't previously seen, big whoop. Plus you can look at them without looking them in the eye.

I'm really disappointed that more Who fans don't appreciate the great job Colin Baker did as the Doctor and am sad that you don't see that he got a terrible crew, terrible sets, terrible writing and still managed to do some great acting and be a great Doctor and *is still* a great Doctor in the Big Finish audios.

I think you're angry because you think that they changed the 'turning into stone when observed' thing from a biological fact to just a protective instinct. However, I don't think they actually changed this. The angels still turn into stone when observed as a biological fact. 

HOWEVER when the angels were around Amy, they were not being observed because her eyes were closed. Yet, because there was a human around who was walking as if she could see, the angels instinctively went into stone mode. When they realized that Amy was not, in fact, able to see them, they started to move again. 

Therefore the turning into stone is still a biological fact, one that is so ingrained in the angels that they instinctively go to stone around humans even when their eyes are closed (at least until they figure out that they can't be seen).

I just can't relate to the idea that there is anything significant to read into the fact that the character's personality fluctuates one way or the other between regenerations. I'm not even sure what your point is, honestly. You can't be saying the last three Doctors were exactly the same. You can't even claim with any solid ground that they were even *attempting* to portray the Doctor from the same angle. 

Is the fact that the last three appear to have similarities that 'greatly outweigh the differences' an issue? A criticism? Should the differences be more or less? Subtle or exaggerated? Is it *better* that the first few were more different from each other than the last few were? What about the fact that the last few are, based on your opinion, even more different than the first few? Is *that* significant? 

I think the important thing, especially concerning this particular show, is that the actor is able to capture the essence of the character and show the audience that the narrative is unaffected by the transition between talent. 

Personally, I look at it like this: 

The Doctor is the Doctor regardless of what his face looks like and what catchphrase he likes to toss around at the moment. There is no comparison between the actors because they aren't trying to be the Doctor *better* than the last guy and we shouldn't look at it like that. Each actor is adding to the role, not reprising it, and that's how we should judge it. So what if they seem similar or not? It means nothing in the face of the overall narrative and is really just petty criticism imo.

I can't? I think I can by observation and others agree (and others disagree). I don't know what mountain of evidence you'd need for solid ground. All I'd offer is a look at any pairing of old series doctors, who are all massively different from one to the next, vs. a look at the general take of all three new doctors, who simply aren't nearly as different. 

&gt;Is the fact that the last three appear to have similarities that 'greatly outweigh the differences' an issue? A criticism? 

No. Actually I prefer it. I like the new Doctor personality and think it makes the show, more or less.  This is not a criticism, its an observation. It's also a disagreement with some fans who I think are splitting hairs on the differences between the doctors, when really, I notice a strong difference in approach between the old series and the new series. 

&gt;The Doctor is the Doctor regardless of what his face looks like and what catchphrase he likes to toss around at the moment. 

This is true and not true depending on how you define the ""Essence of the Doctor's Character"".  You're really saying you don't really care about the doctor's personality as long as he has a tardis and a screwdriver and is a good guy and beats the Daleks.  I mean, that's fine. You're right. He's still the Doctor.  But the personality of the Doctor from incarnation to incarnation has been a discussion of Doctor Who fans for 40 years, and general discussion of the new series quickly results in comparisons between different incarnations. It's an old, fun conversation and one well worth having. I'm making an observation that I haven't seen made before, that there's a stronger ""core Doctor"" personality between incarnations in the new series than there was (quite deliberately) in the old.  

&gt;There is no comparison between the actors because they aren't trying to be the Doctor better than the last guy and we shouldn't look at it like that. Each actor is adding to the role, not reprising it, and that's how we should judge it.

But Doctor Who fans do compare Doctors. That's why every thread has people talking about their favorite Doctors.  The fact that you don't want to have that conversation is fine and all but Doctor Who fans are going to keep having it anyway, like Who fans have since after the first regeneration. 

&gt; It means nothing in the face of the overall narrative and is really just petty criticism imo.

Again, your error is thinking it's criticism rather than observation. ",0,1273696124,null,0,false,0,c0pvqfs,t3_c351r,t1_c0pvqfs,t1_c0pvlbj,null,1426305216,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

Smaller baggy contains your draw. Place inside larger baggy then fill with activated charcoal or coffee. Seal with gaffe tape or something so the coffee/charcoal doesn't spill out and put inside your shoe/sock.

This is extremely OTT but that would be the safest way. Legally you cannot be asked to remove your footwear for a search in a public setting. If an officer of the law has you in a position where he can legally get you to take your shoes off, he is in the same private setting required to legally get the rubber gloves on, so your shoe is the best bet.

As far as dogs are concerned if there is going to be a large police prescence then yes there is a good chance of the dogs coming out to play. Wear clean clothes and don't smoke before hand coupled with the coffee stuff should be enough for a dog, a lot of the smell they pick up is from your clothes which you were smoking weed in. I have been stripped bare with nothing on me because I'd been smoking in the same pair of jeans the night before. Other times I've strolled past them with coke/e/weed in pocket and not been searched. Wouldn't recommend that, each time the dog made a move but for some reason the officer didn't. Either I looked too neat/tidy/not-normal-druggy-type or the dog didn't pull hard enough.

Tennant's entire arc, the central theme for his Doctor, was how much he needs his companions.  Every time he gets angry and judgmental it *seems* dispassionate, because he's intentionally trying to cut himself off from his emotions; they're too painful for him.  In that sense, I think he was the most human of the new Doctors.

You nailed Smith with the manic anger.  Manic everything, really.  I love the way he moves, always fidgeting with his hands, making tiny little gesticulations, hunched over.  He seems uncomfortable in his new body.  It's great.

As I said, sniffer dogs don't work well when there are lots of people who are moving outdoors (they do work well when people are standing around, i.e. a train station), and as its a festival they're only really doing it put on a show anyway, getting caught is a lottery, the key is to make sure that if you get your bag searched they don't find anything.

I go to a few festivals every year and we always try to come up with new ways to hide stuff, these are some of the better ones I've seen.

Taped in the bottom of your sleeping bag, then pack as usual.

Roll on deodorant, - pop out the ball with a knife empty out the liquid and tape the eighth in there.

Pot noodle -  get a pot noodle, open it carefully, put the bag in then superglue the lid shut.

Pringles - same as potnoodle, but just empty out half the crisps, put in the eighth then replace crisps and glue foil lid.

Beer Crate - take a crate of carlsberg or some other oft carried larger, carefully peel apart the end and take out a few cans until you have a hole through to the middle, either replace one of the cans with a [homemade stashcan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE9eyR_n4Bc) or just open one, drink the beer and stick all your stuff in there tightly wrapped in cling film, you can then put that can back in the middle, replace all the other cans an seal up the crate.

They're all over the top, but that's what's fun right? the best are the pringles and the cans, because no person searching is going to start taking apart your crate of beer, or digging through your crisps.",0,1273766608,null,0,false,0,c0pxpq0,t3_c35n2,t1_c0pxpq0,t1_c0pvugu,null,1426306156,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If the dogs gives a signal and they search you and your polite and they find nothing it is more likely that you will be let on your way rather than carted off for a strip search (where they can get the shoe off), especially if dealing with a large volume of people and trying to move people/resources along quickly.

This can often be more hassle than it's worth for the police. 

They position the dogs where the flow of people is slowed and concentrated, gates/doors etc as your right, picking people out from a crowd is not something a dog can do well, as you walk past two by two however it's not that hard.

* She says she learned to fly the Tardis from the best, and says she's sorry the Doctor couldn't be there. (i.e. she didn't learn to fly the Tardis from him). That also means she doesn't think the Doctor is the greatest Tardis pilot.

* She's killed the greatest man she's ever known. Have you considered that might **not** be the Doctor? After all she has that Tardis-like diary book with ""every face"" of the Doctor in it. When she met Tennant she mentioned that when she last saw him he was older and had a moustache. She's not likely killing Matt Smith unless he ages a lot and sprouts facial hair  (that would also sort of kill off the series). Plus, when she met Tennant River Song stated that when she last saw him he was crying (implying he knew her next step would be into the Library where he would have to Archive her).

* And I don't think she's his wife. Yeah she knows high Gallifreyan. Somebody taught her to pilot a Tardis and that somebody probably spoke high Gallifreyan, too. Yeah, she knows the Doctor's real name - maybe he told it to her on the night he was crying so that she could convince his former self of her trustworthiness. She's too catty around him to be a wife and uses ""sweetie"" almost like a taunt. When she sees him she doesn't want to hold him like a caring wife would, nor does she ignore him like an old uncaring couple would, she plays him for all he's worth. There's a power dynamic there between the two and she's using ""spoilers"" to get her way with him. I suspect she's a manipulative on-again off-again companion of the Doctor.

Since Moffat wrote the Library, it must show that whatever River Song has done, the Doctor will forgive her for it. He may even grow to enjoy the challenge of her presence.

**Edit:** consider this quote:

*Professor River Song:*  Funny thing is, this means you've always known how I was going to die. All the time we've been together, you knew I was coming here. The last time I saw you- the real you, the future you, I mean- you turned up on my doorstep with a new haircut and a suit. You took me to Verilian to see the singing towers. What a night that was. The towers sang and you cried. You wouldn't tell me why, but I suppose you knew it was time. My time. Time to come to the Library. You even gave me your screwdriver. That should have been a clue. 
There's nothing you can do. 

*The Doctor:* You can let me do this!

*Professor River Song:* If you die here, it'll mean I've never met you! 

*The Doctor:* Time can be rewritten.

*Professor River Song:* **Not those times. Not one line. Don't you dare!** It's OK. It's OK. It's not over for you. You'll see me again. You've got all of that to come. You and me, time and space. You watch us run.

*The Doctor:* River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear. There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could…

*Professor River Song:* Hush now. Spoilers.

&gt;However, it cannot be denied that such issues as equal pay, domestic violence and maternity leave have been on the agenda in a way that they were not before.

And all these issues have been proven to have nothing to do with discrimination.

The wage gap is entirely attributable to socially acceptable factors.

http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf

Domestic violene, according to the center for disease control and any other respectable organisation, is more likely to be initiated by women then it is by men.

If you accept that we ought to be creating equality of opportunity rather then equality of outcome, there is no reason to treat any of these issues as though they were evidence of discrimination. The only reason you could jump to that conclusion is if you believe that gender is a social construct.

The other perspective is that of seeing Tom Baker's post Who roles. While the show made him one of the most recongnisable faces on television, this made it difficult to get other work.

true,thecompletegeek2,smith,Smith,"While I love the concept of the Doctor conquering the Master with, well, love and not violence—divorced from the Tinkerbell scene, the hug and ""I forgive you"" are pretty moving—it's certainly not in the character of the Tenth Doctor's Lonely Vengeful God ethos. I mean, up to that point, we'd seen ""I used to have so much mercy"", drowning the Empress's children, trapping the Family of Blood in And I Must Scream positions, and quite a few other points where the Doctor runs out of patience; surely the Master, who'd tried to subjugate the Universe so many times before, would be much less likely to be the recipient of such grace.

I think that yes, the scene's meant to illustrate the yin/yang dynamic, but not because the Doctor is the (warm) yang to the Master's (cold) yin; rather, the Doctor's forgiving the Master because the Master completes him, and, in fact, *the Master's all he has left*. The title of the episode—*Last of the Time Lords*—is revealing; the Doctor's suddenly realised that, as the Face of Boe said, He Is Not Alone, and he's desperately trying to cling onto not just another member of his race but a childhood friend, albeit one who's grown up and gone in a very different moral direction. That simultaneously makes the scene more heartbreaking and the Doctor a more tragic figure (if also more hypocritical in his sanctimony).

Some criticise the Master's refusal to regenerate, and I can understand that (given his sliminess in obtaining twelve more regenerations earlier in OldWho), but in a way, it was the most effective way he could strike at the heart(s) of the Doctor. Without the Master, the Doctor's more effectively broken—he'd killed off all but one other of his race, and failed in trying to save that one.

This is part of why I don't think *The End of Time, Pt. 2* is quite as terrible as many make it out to be—it's a more fulfilling quasi-redemption for the Master. Over the course of the 2009 specials, the Doctor had become more megalomaniacal (hence the Ood determining his time to die) and more like the old-timey Master, and so (as everything balances) the newly-returned Master would have to grow (in a much shorter time span) to be more like the Doctor. The two paths converge in the confrontation at the gate, featuring the heights of Ten's arrogance and the Master's self-sacrifice. Only one remains—one who, by that time, has lived too long, and needs to regenerate. (This is rather telling, considering that the whole of *End of Time* has the subtext of RTD relinquishing control of NuWho, saying good-bye to all the characters he loved and developed.)

There are a lot of really, really interesting ideas in RTD's work; I just wish he hadn't put heart before brain so often. :-(

(Incidentally, possibly excepting *The Eleventh Hour*, the Eleventh Doctor's attempted or accidentally instituted genocide in every story so far—space whales, the Daleks, [the Weeping Angels, the Saturnynians](/spoiler)—but doesn't get quite so drunk on his power, even going so far as to plan on renouncing his Doctorate. I like what one person pointed out—that ""the Tenth Doctor was about taking ordinary people on a grand adventure through time and space, while the Eleventh Doctor is a madman careening around the universe in a box""—and I definitely am amused by the fact that even though the Doctor's now mostly rid himself of the megalomania and hops hither and thither trying to help people, he still has just as much power of life and death as before, arguably misuses it more, and ends up being more dangerous than Ten ever was. I hope that that's developed/touched upon more in later episodes.)

Time will tell how things pan out, but a coalition is not the same thing as allowing the Tories free reign to do what they please. If the Lib Dems act as an effective counterbalance to some of the more radical Tory ideas while letting them run with the good ones, it will be the best case that can be made for implementing PR, so it is in their interest to let this happen. Also, Cameron has made a big political gamble with this and for him to be a credible PM the coalition must be perceived to be working. Certainly compromise and constructive dialogue is better than the them-and-us mentality of American politics, which is vastly counterproductive.

I think Boris Johnson summed it up right when he said that all the parties had been punished by the British public, Labour pushed out of power, the Lib Dems actually losing seats, and the Conservatives denied the absolute mandate they expected. Now they're being forced to act like grown ups.

Nor does [Season 3, episode 8](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0785288/)

EDIT: SHIT! [Third Doctor, 8th episode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_and_the_Silurians): Silurians. Already rumoured as [appearing in this series](http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/cult/s7/doctor-who/news/a202786/silurians-to-return-to-doctor-who.html).

Also worth noting, Silurians are water-based creatures. Considering the multiple references to water so far, this looks like it might be significant:

    * Amy POND
    * Jackson LAKE
    * Adelaide BROOKE
    * RIVER Song
    * Duck POND
    * Star WHALE
    * ""impossible truth in a glass of WATER""
    * Sister of the WATER
    * The POOL in the Tardis

EDIT2: as moju helpfully pointed out, next week, we have [this creature](http://imgur.com/aJKWi), which certainly looks like an updated [silurian](http://dailypop.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/silurian-1.jpg) to me, and imdb has a character in next weeks episode listed as a ['Slurian'](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1591789/).

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I think the idea of choosing what is actually reality was brilliant. The resolution, on the other hand, was too simple. First, what was the point?

The point was to make them choose a reality to exist in, when in reality it wasn't reality at all (if that makes sense). The Dream Lord wanted them to *think* they had chosen reality, when in fact they had just chosen another dream.

&gt;Also, I didn't believe Amy killing herself so easily, more so taken that she's pregnant, even if her bf just died. Doesn't she care at all about the child? (it was a dream, granted, but she wasn't sure)

Amy chose to end the 'reality' where Rory dies because it was not a reality she wanted to live in. She decided to risk her unborn child for the chance of saving the father of that child. I can see the reality of this decision, even if it is not one I would make myself.

&gt;Also, the fact that both experiences were dreams was sadly a very predictable plot thing.

I agree with this. I worked this out myself early on in the episode.

&gt;The Doctor claims to know the Dream Lord but he doesn't really say anything of him before the very end. How could he know him anyway, he doesn't exist.

But he does exist. He exists (and always has, and always will) as a part of the Doctor himself. He recognised his dark half within the Dream Lord.
