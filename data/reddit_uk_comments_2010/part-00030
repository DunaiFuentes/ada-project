The aforementioned redditor also said early analysis had confirmed fears many London boroughs would remain ""largely unaffordable"" for these people from 2011, and a ""significant further amount"" would do so by 2016.

Boris Johnson branded the redditor an 'insensitive clod' for suggesting that it made more sense for people who don't even work in London to not live there than for hundreds of thousands of people to commute long distances in misery.

Said redditor can be found on one of the commuter trains tomorrow morning, then later on the tube/sauna... if it's working... surrounded by many, many more people in the same situation who also have families and desire some sort of quality of life but cannot afford both that and living in London.",0,1288569783,null,0,true,0,c141a7f,t3_dz6w6,t1_c141a7f,t3_dz6w6,null,1426545889,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,handmedownthemoon,null,null,"1. The Scotland and the UK currently spends 2.5% of GDP on defence. After the coming defence cuts in Scotland (i.e. RAF Kinloss being closed), Scotland will have a smaller military presence than Ireland, which only spends 0.6% GDP. A good deal? I think not. We also wouldn't need to spend billions on foreign wars and Trident. And we don't rely on being British to pay for education, healthcare etc. Even with all the important economic levers being controlled by Westminster, we have a budget surplus, compared to the UK as a whole running a massive deficit.

2. Just the other day there were newspaper reports showing that Ireland, Norway, Iceland etc. still have a much better quality of life than the UK. Of course, in a world economic downturn, it helps that Norway has had an oil fund since 1995, which is now worth &gt;£500bn. The fact that oil is running out means that it will command a very high price. Imagine what we could do in your estimate of 50 years that Norway did in just 15? Also, would an independent Scotland have failed to regulate our banks in the way that London did?

3. Scotland currently doesn't even have a direct say in Europe. Tiny countries like Malta and Luxembourg do. We would have no desire to be some kind of world big-shot. And what good does being in the G8 do for the UK? Certainly not the highest quality of life for its people as I mentioned before.

4. Using the ""oil is running out"" argument against independence is like telling a young man that he needn't try to make anything of his life because he will die of old age soon. How do other small countries with almost no natural resourses manage to cope? If we became independent now, then we could invest the oil revenue in a fund instead od letting London waste it on illegal wars etc. Then we'd have 50 years to adjust.

Consider yourself lucky.  The vast majority of working people are paying way in excess of that in travel costs each month.

It's about £100 per month (insurance, tax, servicing) *plus* another £60 each time I fill it up with petrol (only about once a month in my case).

You also have to consider whether a collection of lower skilled workers in a certain area leads to higher unemployment amongst that socio-economic group in that area, and therefore, additional benefits to be paid.

true,TheMemo,cnty-uk,Bristol,"Well, personally, I believe civil liberties ('freedom') is more important than individual lives. It is that idea that has given birth to free societies, to democracy, to social equality, to all the rights we take for granted today.

If you believe that your freedoms, or those of others, should be given away or suspended for a little 'safety,' you are nothing but a coward and just as much an enemy of civilised, free society as the terrorists you are so afraid of.

For an individual, the odds of dying from a car accident or choking on food are far greater than the odds of dying in a terrorist attack. The only reason terrorism is so feared is because of the sheer amount of media coverage, rather than the number of such incidents.

The idea that the government believes that terrorism ""is the most pressing threat we face today"" demonstrates only how utterly backward the average person's (or politician's) perception of danger is - it is a result of our evolutionary history that we assign greater importance to dangerous things that we hear about more.

Of course, terrorism is so-called because its intent is to engender 'terror.' The manner by which it does so is not through destruction, but through the media - this current Yemen package plot is evidence of this - it failed, and yet succeeded by filling the media with scary stories. The best way to fight terrorism is not through security, or the removal of freedoms, it is simply to refrain from reporting terrorist attacks or attempts or to, at the very least, place them within a suitable context. This, unfortunately, requires restraint on the part of the media - something unlikely to happen as the media profit from the fear they engender. Still, it is important to bear in mind that terrorism is perpetrated not just by 'terrorists,' but also the media itself.

true,ColdFusion87,cnty-england,Stockton-on-Tees?,"Well it's a difficult topic because it's hard to say what necessary care is and then where the NHS draws the line at what is cost-effective. There can be different levels of treatment - for example to fill a space where there's a missing tooth there are 3 main options; a denture (removable), a bridge (fixed), or an implant (fixed). In the NHS we already do a little treatment denial because we don't have unlimited funds. 

An implant is really the best thing, but it is the most technique sensitive and expensive option. Implants can involve a lot of complex work, and are only offered on the NHS in cases of trauma/oral cancer (where extensive facial reconstruction might be involved). 

Bridges are usually quite an attractive next option - they don't have a load of plastic in your mouth. However, bridges require you to use another tooth to attach the false tooth to. In the mouth of a patient who is not stable - in terms of plaque control and sugar intake - a bridge will compromise the tooth we are using as support.

In an unstable mouth dentures are the best option. Teeth can easily be added on to dentures so we are able to plan for the loss of further teeth. 


Now let's talk about aesthetics. Say someone has a tooth missing at the front (which they have lost due to decay, and they currently have other cavities and are not taking care of their teeth), but functionally they are having no problems, do you think they deserve to have that space filled? I wouldn't feel right telling a patient they didn't deserve to have something put in place there, but from a health point of view is it truly necessary? 

I do think the NHS is a wonderful thing and benefits so many people. I truly believe that other countries should be envious of what the NHS does in this country.

The other issue is the hunchback look. If they kept the design and just chopped the back shorter, it would look great. When they turn sideways, the hunchback makes the head look so tiny. The tiny head looks more silly than intimidating.

In this instance, the European Communities Act and the Human Rights Act specifically protect the right to vote freely in democratic elections. Cases like R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex p. Simms have been clear on this principle, albeit for different fundamental rights in those specific instances; protecting a prisoner's right to vote is nothing new in that sense.",0,1288715863,null,0,true,0,c147red,t3_dzy0b,t1_c147red,t1_c147lhx,null,1426548942,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,robosatan,null,null,"&gt;In answer to your first point, do you also think that children, people sectioned under the mental health act and foreign citizens living in other countries should be allowed to vote in UK elections?

Children cannot be deemed responsible for their own actions, let alone for those of others. On those grounds and for the sake of childhood being a time of innocence, then no, I don't think children should not be allowed to vote. Perhaps the age could be lowered, personally I think 16 is a nice all round transition age, you are supposedly educated enough to make your own choices (school-wise). I mean hell, you're technically old enough to make the decision that you can fight and die for your country why shouldn't you vote. An alternative option in my oppinion would be to leave the voting age at 18 but make Further Education mandatory, be it purely academic such as current 6th or through vocational apprenticeships.

The mentally ill are a tricky subject. In a sense they are treat like children, those who are unable to be responsible for their own actions. Though while I'd like to think that only the extremes of mental illness are sectioned under the mental health act, there must be borderline cases and those borderline cases would have no voice to defend themselves. It was only 50 years ago that homosexuals could find themselves institutionalised. So for the small fraction of the population that is made up of the mentally ill, I think it is neither dangerous nor unfair to allow them to vote.

Foreign nationals living in the UK should have a right to vote as much as any non-tax paying UK national should have the right. Even more so in my opinion since while they may not be directly contributing to our country through taxes they are most likely strengthening the economy through their work and expenditure, and are not a direct leech to society like a number of non-tax paying UK nationals who live on benefits are.

I agree that indeterminate sentances could be an interesting way to deal with rehabilitation, but I guess the test of truth would be in how to ensure an inmate is reviewed fairly and without corruption. I have to shoot, but yah as for the right to vote thing I guess we'll have to agree to disagree ^_^",0,1288716958,null,0,true,0,c147ubr,t3_dzy0b,t1_c147ubr,t1_c147jeh,null,1426548980,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In the south (I lived there for 10 years) The amount of black people arrested seriously outweighs there percentage in the population. I Florida by 4X last I saw. 

In my experience living in a mixed family. Black folks are no more likely to commit crimes then white. But I can assure you my wife was much more likely to be pulled over then me when driving through certain parts of the country. 

Abuse of power is easy to see when it is given to any authority. The abuse of laws created in the UK over the last 13 years is very clear. Is it beyond possibility that the government may create laws just to reduce opposition?

Yes to assume that letting everyone vote will force people to vote responsibly is silly.#

But I would say that when we refuse to limit the right to vote. We as a nation are much more likely to get the government we deserve. 

If we dont go out and vote responsibly then we deserve what we get. This includes rapists voting to make rape legal (given the unlikelihood of that ever happening) 

We deserve our current laws because we as a people did not have the courage or responsibility to stand at parliment with pitch forks when they came out. We wanted to be safe. 

As a nation we no longer have much courage we are not willing to give up our comforts to control our government. So our government controls us. 

Opening up the vote will have a number of effects. But I still think if a party runs on taking a stronger stand against some crime people who have felt they should commit that crime should have the opportunity to vote against it. For example drug use. 

If society is not willing to be responsible for their government then they deserve exactly what they get. 

We britts are far to tolerant of the abuse and failed promises of our governors. The fact that we are to fucking lazy to vote should not be an excuse to take it from others.

What this legislation does is shift the cost from the treasury to the student, without offering additional funding to the universities.  I would also bet that it will increase inequality in access and decrease social mobility.  

&gt;It also makes students sit up and realise that maybe they should go to lectures and study if they're paying this much for it.

If it does that it will also likely disincentive them from going in the first place.  More to the point, most students do go to lectures and study, if they don't the universities should be dealing with them....

Personally, I don't believe a constitutional republic is the best form of government - I believe 'no government' is the best form of government (anarchy) but, if we are to have government, it should be as widely distributed and as participatory as communities we see on the internet - which means an end to representative democracy as we know it - representation only serves to take complex issues and cut them into pre-defined ideological slices, none of which are correct. I prefer a system that either works on the basis of evidence and the scientific method, or absolute democracy where all things are voted upon by all people and groups are formed around issues and dispersed when there is a resolution.

&gt; I will do whatever I can to convince people who don't understand that the rewards of liberty are worth the risks to security

Well, we are in agreement there - I don't believe in the 'right to safety' if it infringes on more important rights like liberty and free expression. Societies grow by means of freedom of expression, of investigation, of action and to sacrifice those in pursuit of safety is to choke society and prevent it from evolving, progressing. Admittedly, there are some actions which harm society - but we must always be certain that the harm done to society by an action is greater than the harm done by removing or reducing certain rights for all in order to prevent it.

I've already put forward an argument suggesting that this legislation improves the quality of university education. I think we actually agree here.

&gt;What this legislation does is shift the cost from the treasury to the student, without offering additional funding to the universities. I would also bet that it will increase inequality in access and decrease social mobility.

So, what's key here is that this isn't an arbitrary movement of cost. The cost has been moved to the end user of the product, so they now have a higher vested interest in the quality of their education.

&gt;If it does that it will also likely disincentive them from going in the first place. More to the point, most students do go to lectures and study, if they don't the universities should be dealing with them....

The fact that universities even allow students to leave with a 3rd or 2:2 (60% on exams at my uni) is an indication that slacking students aren't being dealt with. I can speak from experience as a slacking student.

&gt;Using cash as a differentiator is bad, it is inequitable and harms society.

If it's care of society that's the issue here, why give the money to the heaping pile of inefficiency that is central government to dole out?

true,ajehals,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;I've already put forward an argument suggesting that this legislation improves the quality of university education. I think we actually agree he

I don't think you have presented a compelling one. The fact that people are paying more for something that at present is seen as a requirement by many does not mean that universities will increase quality, nor does it mean that those paying will know to demand higher quality and nor does it mean that there will be additional funding for any significant improvements...

&gt;The cost has been moved to the end user of the product, so they now have a higher vested interest in the quality of their education.

They have always had that interest, adding a monetary aspect doesn't necessarily mean anything will change.  In short people still won't necessarily be in a position to make real decisions between universities (due to limited supply) and therefore won't necessarily be able to pressure universities into improving quality where it is lacking (especially if the end result is still a bit of paper to get a job...).  

In short people already have a vested interest, the additional cost won't necessarily create a linear increase in that.

&gt;The fact that universities even allow students to leave with a 3rd or 2:2 (60% on exams at my uni) is an indication that slacking students aren't being dealt with. I can speak from experience as a slacking student.

And how will that change if it costs more?  The universities should be dealing with this by removing those who are not performing, if those who are not performing are now directly responsible for funding the university it seems that there wouldn't exactly be an increased interest in dealing with it.  

&gt;If it's care of society that's the issue here, why give the money to the heaping pile of inefficiency that is central government to dole out?

I would say that describing central government as a heaping pile of inefficiency in inaccurate in many cases.  

&gt;Lower the taxes accordingly for people to put into much more efficient charitable scholarship organisations. 

Which would increase overhear and again benefit those with a higher disposable income in a position to invest. Remember we are talking about students here who won't have had time to save.

I agree that we should be able to work for ourselves and be independent...

But the scale of our jobs has hidden that we're all in this together, working to help each other out.  There's no ""Baker"", ""Smithy"", or woodworker anymore. A lot of Americans would like to pay no tax (I agree it's being wasted so much right now) - but in the ""good old days""(if they existed) the tax was ideally meant to build things for everyone - synergy. we get libraries and police, and fire fighters...

Now though, the button pusher in a soul destroying job quite rightly doesn't see how they're helping society. In fact, due to all the profits being skimmed off their CEO, they're helping very little to society.
A few more generations of this and I fear Americans will be so isolated, any sense of standing together will be completely destroyed, and the people will be totally exploited by corporations. No strikes, no workers unions, no sense of community.

true,blindinlight,null,null,"&gt; generally when people go on strike they lose their income for the period of striking and are trying to make their and other peoples life's better for the future.

True, but having good intentions doesn't mean they're necessarily *right*, and even if they're acting in a self-interested way justifiably, it doesn't follow that it's for the good of *everybody else*.

I support people's right to strike, and believe many strikes are justified and worthy of support. Have been a lefty, well, forever. But (perhaps I'm getting old) I increasingly suspect that industrial action is inevitable not to truly protect the workers' interests from hostile capitalists, but rather to take advantage of favourable circumstances to force management to acquiesce to their demands, which are not *necessarily* reasonable.

For example, the threat of: post strikes every christmas, public transport strikes during the olympics, airline strikes every summer, fire brigade on bonfire night etc. etc...

Some of these I'd probably support. But the fact that a union is striking (or threatening to) doesn't *necessarily* mean they've got a good case. It could be that their leaders are - quite rationally - playing the strategy game, in their members' interest. But that's not necessarily the same as the *public interest*.

As for striking in this day and age it's pretty tough to support with the current unfair dismissal and OH&amp;S laws and unemployment rate.  A lot of the time it just seems they're being greedy pricks holding their employers to ransom or playing power games.

Take the current tube strikes.  A tube driver makes over £40,000 a year with generous holiday benefits.  I believe station staff are on £25-29,000.  As I understand the strikes are over the reduction in the number of ticketing office staff.  These are to be made through voluntary redundancies and natural staff losses.  Their jobs are not currently threatened.  

So why are they striking?  Why as public employees are they allowed to hold the city to ransom?  The decision to cut staff was made by our elected official, the Mayor.  Why are these guys just allowed to cause huge disruption to what is basically an essential service just because they don't agree with a policy?

&gt; ""These strikes have always been unjustified, unnecessary and utterly avoidable.""

is simply unhelpful. The union has a right to strike and although some of these strikes could indeed have been avoided, the fact that they weren't avoided is as much the ""fire authority""s fault as the union delegates'.

It deeply worries me when an institution as well respected and necessary as the fire fighters seems to be in internal crisis as often as it is, but picket lines and paper headlines will not resolve issues as deep-set as these. Both sides must come to the table with diplomacy, tact and a genuine willingness to resolve the issues to all parties' satisfaction before these strikes can come to an end and allow our fire fighters to get back to doing their jobs.

Why? It seems like the right time to strike if there is a genuine grievance.

These are dire times for everyone working in the public sector, but a whole hell of a lot of the costs and rationalisations are utterly insane and counterproductive in terms of costs and benefits, indeed many are harmful (others are plain stupid), that is in part because people are panicking and in part because for some reason we have allowed the public sector to be labelled as largely waste and administrators within it to be seen as a burden rather than taking a proper look and trying to solve some of the underlying issues...

The huge costly issues (things like IT systems, procurement, training and such) are being ignored to a large degree because they are hard to deal with whilst redundancies (voluntary or otherwise) are going to pile more pressure on the people who were working within areas where manpower was already short and tasking already higher than anticipated when these establishments were put together.",0,1288950103,null,0,false,0,c14k4u6,t3_e1hf5,t1_c14k4u6,t1_c14jwyg,null,1426554747,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

For example, utility providers are very quick to respond to increases in the cost of energy by passing those increases on to customers. They are far less ‘agile’ when it comes to passing on cost reductions.

The 'stickiness' of legislation that undermines civil liberties and confers greater powers to governments is a further reason that such legislation should be stiffly resisted. Moreover temporal justifications, ‘this legislation is required now to counter x threat but will be removed when x threat has diminished’, should be treated extremely sceptically.

Also, in recent times many of strikes have been over pay not rising fast enough - that should not be a direct threat to ones livlihood although I do agree it may suck a bit.

true,robosatan,null,null,"You can probably call me biassed since I work at one of BAEs shipyards but what do you expect BAE to accept in their contracts? The government, granted thats the previous government, asked for 2+ boats. That means we designed, planned and costed the project around building 2+ boats. This means:

* The first boat is always the most expensive to build. When you come to making the 2nd then hopefully you've ironed out any of the construction and design problems you encountered in the first. So 2 boats for £10bn does not mean 1 boat = £5bn.

* We subcontract a lot of ships systems to 3rd party suppliers. We may have negotiated a cheaper price through the fact we would be buying 2+. If we tell the suppliers we only actually want one, then the price of the first boat may potentially inflate.

* While it sounds like a lot of money, imagine how much it would cost to provide benefits to the 5000 employees who lose their jobs. And not to mention the cascading effect that we would place on our suppliers (who may have recruited more staff to provide whatever service we've asked for).

As for the comment that they'll have to figure a way to make sure this will never happens again, and comments in the replies that say ""It's simple just put a clause in the contract to say you can pull out at any time without compensation"". Do you really think any company is that stupid? The government changes every 4 years, if you're going to get in to a long term project with a party that is so fickle (party as in a legal body, not the conservative party) then you are never going to put ink on a contract that doesn't cover your ass.

As I've pointed out in previous posts about trident:

* The defense budget is much smaller compared to the benefit budget.

* While £5bn sounds like a lot it's likely to be spent over 10+ years, ie £0.5bn/year as opposed to the £100bn+/year wellfare/benefits budget.

* There are many more benefits to a programme like this than just ""getting a carrier/submarine"" it requires a lot of skilled workers and likely provides more benefit to the economy than the same amount of cash in wellfare/benefits.

* A large portion of the cost of the submarine makes its way across the country. It isn't just £5bn in BAE's pocket, we probably keep a number of people employed indirectly.

* If you shut down a shipyard then decide you need to replace a carrier in 5-10 years time, you lose all the skill and experience that you accumulated had and have start from scratch. While there are undoubtedly engineers who are qualified to do the work, experience is a big part of projects of this size. You aren't just trying to get 50 cars off a production line each day, you're constructing a 100m long iron and steel leviathan that in a worst case scenario is going to have shells the size of your torso fired at it or stalked by submarines that fire missiles that can hit a target the size of a car when launched from a different time zone. Design and build mistakes don't just cost money to rectifiy, they cost lives.

tl;dr: BAE aren't doing anything underhand with what they put in their contracts and I doubt any company would sign a 10 year contract with a 4 year government without such protection.

[Sir Humphrey put it best...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90f9Qm60tU8)

The defence review was extremely disappointing, and the publication of this 'in strict confidence' letter (they didn't even try to leak it?) very galling.

Britain's strategic planning has gone horrifically wrong. When BAE and VT invested in the shipyards it was because of a plan of workload that stretched out several decades. The shipyards would spend one decade building the Type 45's, then those would make way for a decades construction of the carriers, and those would make way for the construction of the Type 26 frigates. The yard in Barrow would build the seven new Astute submarines, eventually leading onto the replacement Trident submarines. 

The knowledge, technology and experience generated at the start would be maintained and fed through each of these projects, maintaining skills and keeping down costs.

So much for that.

The number of Type 45's went from 12, to 8, to 6. The Astute build programme was stretched out further and further to save costs (and now its going to have to be stretched even further because the Trident replacement has been pushed back). 

The Type 26 has been cut from 18 to 13, and the only real reason that the second CVF wasn't cancelled was because of the several-year hole that would leave the shipyards completely idle.

Why is it we can't adapt our plans appropriately? Why is it we grant the forces these massive demands for new equipment, then spend the next several years pruning them back?

This shouldn't be thrown at BAE's feet. Industry, all industry, benefits from long-term stability and planning, not short-term political games.

The leak of this letter is the Conservatives yet again saying 'look, this isn't our fault! Blame Labour! Blame the industry!', yet they planted the seeds of this the last time they were in power.

1. Striking is not a political tool.

2. Striking on matters of principle is bollocks. A strike better have a good pragmatic justification. What we need is real socialism akin to real politik.

3. Any body with the power to strike better have proper safe guards against abuse by politically motivated higher ups. I wrote a long list the other day of the various mechanisms of abuse the union leader class used against their workers.

The reason we don't get strikes so much today is because Thatcher strengthened workers rights to resist unions. She removed the ability of unions to compel their members via underhanded methods. The end result has made it very difficult for unions to put together legal strike action but has also removed the rampant abuse of the past that had people more afraid of their unions than their boss.

Maybe at some point there will be a need to soften the laws but frankly when I look at the people who support unions I do not want to be tied to them in any way shape or form.

The sound of The Kop waking up, starting to find its voice again, is something that should intimidate any footballer in England.  
Oh yeah, and that bit about Gerrard grabbing himself a hat-trick too, that was a nice experience too.

But seriously. If Gerrard decides to turn into Captain Fantastic again, then we suddenly have someone who can provide goals again. Torres seems to gradually and slowly be picking up his game. 

I'm not pessimistic about the situation. Sure, we just recently got out of the bottom three. But still, it's just one quarter of the season gone by.

&gt; Firework, which Meyers insists is a solemn attempt to ""articulate...what it means to be an underdog"", was rather hastily dedicated to the It Gets Better project, set up this autumn to console gay teenagers considering suicide with the knowledge that their lives will improve. It Gets Better is a worthy and necessary initiative in a world where LGBT youth invariably face savage bullying at school, at home and in their communities.
&gt;
&gt; The problem with this approach is that it entirely evades responsibility to change the situation, accepting homophobic hostility as something young people just have to suffer through until they're old enough to move somewhere with a passable scene. The notion that personal resilience is the only possible response to injustice is burnt into the retinas after a single viewing of Firework. There is something distinctly counter-revolutionary about the exploding tits hypothesis of personal transformation.
&gt;
&gt; The serious message that Firework seems to be sending is that you can't actually fight the social structures that put obstacles like homophobia, body fascism or street crime in your way. All you can do is find the strength to battle against the odds, possibly with the help of a go-getting attitude and a pair of fantastic jugs - you're not supposed to question why the odds are stacked against you in the first place.

They are typically interrupted by some commotion, e.g. a child screaming, bank robbery, etc., and they politely ask for them to be quiet because they're making a documentary for Radio 4, etc.  The noisy parties quickly oblige.  After all, it is Radio 4.

So the underlying theme of these sketches is that Radio 4 broadcasts yawn-inducing content.  In quoting the line from it, I was in fact agreeing with your point while attempting to inject some light humour into the proceedings.

The vast majority of people who are on benefits haven't chosen to be in that position. When I left uni 2 years ago, I was unemployed for a year afterwards. This was not through lack of trying. I sent applications to anywhere and everywhere. Trouble is, after the recession had hit, there were few jobs left. And those that were left were under a lot of competition from people who had recently been laid off due to companies going into administration left, right and centre. I live in a fairly small area, so the knock-on effect of this hit hard. Being a fresh out of uni graduate I was told repeatedly that I would not be hired because I lacked experience; in a time of uncertainty companies neither wanted to take the risk, no have to spend money on training.

I was made to do compulsory 'voluntary' work, with the local council. What angered me, in the end, was the fact that there were plenty of jobs available. I was even told that they were hurting for new staff, but they wouldn't hire anyone because of bullshit budget cutbacks, despite the fact that the local council had just shelled out big money on relocation to a new set of offices which unnecessary and costly. I couldn't help but feel that money could have been better spent by creating new jobs for people.

I agree that there will always be a minority for whom living on benefits will become a way of life, but this shouldn't be used as justification to discriminate against those of us who have been unfortunate to end up in such a position.

Take for example, housing benefit. It has a maximum payout of £400 per week which is £1600 per month. Now taking a rule of thumb measurement of income spent on housing which is 30% of income that would suggest the claimant would need to earn &gt; £3K per month. That's a bit above the average wage.

Ok, I realise that not many will get this but in the least it should encourage you to stop and think what we as taxpayers are funded. Especially since this excludes any other benefits that are payable.

The portion of taxes that go to unemployment and NI pay for themselves in economic terms or would you rather live in the US where people have to work unreasonable hours to get paid low wages because there is no real safety net.

He's had a lot of problems: relocating at a young age, adjusting to the speed of the league (his biggest problem is that he's too slow), being played out of position, the inexplicable hatred a lot of people show for him and having to replace Xabi Alonso in the team. He's finally coming into his own and I think he's played very well these last few weeks. Made some vital blocks and tackles against Bolton and helped up the pressure on Napoli when he came on mid-week. Has played a part in several recent goals too. And a great strike in the EL a few weeks ago, too.

I've always felt bad for the guy, he gets so much abuse despite clearly trying his absolute hardest for the team, and sadly he still doesn't seem to be getting much credit for the performances he's been putting in. One thing I hate about fans is when they demand absolute loyalty and indefatigable passion from the players, but offer none of the same loyalty and patience in return. This guy has never given anything less than he had, and I think that at least entitles him to some respect. Jokes are okay (dear god, I've made a few) but there seems to be some real personal hatred directed at him and David Ngog, another player who's been thrust in out of his depth and has done his best to fill the role. 

Out-played Mikel in a similar role today. Best Brazilian on the pitch.

World War Two truly was the world's darkest hour.  When we look back at history we forget that things could have turned out differently.  If the Nazis had created the atomic bomb before us; If we had lost the Battle of El Alamein; If the Japanese hadn't bombed Pearl Harbour; right now we could be living under one of the most repressive, barbaric and inhuman regimes ever to grace the face of the earth.  
The whole world could have been subservient to the ideals of racial purity barbarism and autocracy.  

I believe that every single person that put their efforts into winning that war is a hero.  And the ones that gave their lives even more so.  

However our armed forces weren't disbanded after world war two.  
They still exist because the threat of tyranny still exists.  There are still barbaric regimes in the world today.  There are many people in the world who would seek to destroy our liberty and our democracy.  

When our armed forces are at their worst they are barbaric, thoughtless and moronic.  They harm the ideals that this country is built on.  Frequently they are pushed into conflicts by idiots who have no foresight and no knowledge of history.  Political ineptitude is a worst sin than political evil.  

However when they are at their best, they protect women, children, schools and hospitals.  They fight for the exact same thing that our grandfathers fought for.  They fight for freedom and democracy.  For the right for people in far off lands to choose their own rulers.

A lot of the time when the show goes abroad they cut out content so they can put in 15 to 20 minutes of ads and nicely monetise it. Other ways of getting to the content are paid for in one way or another.

They definitely need to try and monetise it. A lot of people who are Doctor Who fans download the show and they are eating into its development margins by doing that. On the BBC you can only invest in a show what it makes back. In other words if Doctor Who was making twice as much there would be twice as much to invest back into the show. The show has increased and decreased in funding for decades based on how much it was making.

It is important to support shows that you watch and the BBC need to find a way to make money from what would usually be ""fans"" of the show who illegally download it. I'm not sure how ads will work considering the way the syndicate networks do it but maybe the best way would be offering people a number of options.

Racked up a monumental deficit and debt. He also sold our gold off at an all time low.

He's a PhD graduate in History (and did his thesis on the History of the Labour Party, or something like that). Exactly the sort of person you want for the job of finance minister of one of the world's financial command centres.

(and before you say it, I'm aware that Osborne isn't much better. But he does at least have Ken Clarke and Vince Cable nearby)
