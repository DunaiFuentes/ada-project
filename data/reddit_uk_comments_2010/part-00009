Try and get some cheap multi-vitamins from Boots or your local chemist. The last thing you want is a vitamin deficiency. Porridge is also a nutritious staple food and quite cheap; the fibre will help.

Now would be a good time to call in any favours that you're owed; your friends and family won't want to see you struggling (well, not any more than they are). I'm sure they would be *more* offended if they found out you needed help, but didn't ask them for it.

Also, after checking with your university, check with your local Citizen's Advice Bureau if you can receive any sort of benefit or allowance, even if it's low.

For the love of the gods though, try and avoid taking cash out on your credit card if you can at all help it. They will ream you with interest and fees.

true,Kiram,mcgann,McGann,"I recently re-watched Love and Monsters, and to be honest, I liked it a lot more the second time. But it was still one of, if not the worst episode of the new series. (Incidentally, I need a new word for ""series"" since that word doubles up to mean what Americans call ""seasons.) Similarly, I felt that [School Reunion](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/School_Reunion) was silly and didn't really do much for me. My second or third watch-through, I simply skipped it entirely. And I personally disliked greatly [The Lazarus Experiment](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Lazarus_Experiment) for some reason. 

I feel like a lot of Doctor Who is going to be hit-and-miss, just do to the nature and history of the show. In the end, it's often a show that aims for and can pull of silly and campy in a big way. It can also do very serious type stories in the vein of Blink, or Midnight. But too much serious starts to detract from the fun; too much action and it starts to get cheesy. Given that the head writer is now very well known for his serious and creepy episodes, I'm not at all surprised that the show is off to a bit of a shaky start in the action arena. Give it some time, though, and I'm sure it will be brilliant.

One of the things I am most excited about with the new team and the new doctor is that, in so many of his stories, Steven Moffat really has shown that he understands or at leasts wants to understand the fact that the Doctor is a time traveler. Not just someone who pops back into the past, but someone for whom events tend to get tangled up and out of order. He deals with this expertly in River Song and with the Girl in the Fireplace, and touched on it as a major plot-point in Blink. The whole idea of Wibbly-Wobbly, Timey-Wimey he seems to understand (and indeed, seemingly coined the term.) These concepts could be overdone really, really easily, but salted in at the right moments, it can really help pull you into the life of this time traveler.

But the budget is 9 billion so what savings? Never mind aid is often tied to trade, so there is another loss to the economy. Meanwhile, those who leave take their skills, entrepreneurial input, and wealth with them. What will replace that loss to the economy. What will happen to the NHS and services with the loss of skills. It's easy to say we will train people, but is the talent there? Youths will be pushed into some form of ""national service"" which has some very dodgy connotations, so they are not available plus a further economic drain. Previous comments have also suggested a woman's place is in the home. More skill loss.

Further, the BNP likes the idea of a pre 1948 UK. That's 4 million people they roughly want to shift. So this proposal is talking of over 20 years of this.

Gordon Brown: Very unlikely. His popularity has dropped since taking the current role of PM and leader of Labour. It would depend on how many Labour loyalists would still vote for them, which I imagine would be a lot.

true,essjay2009,cnty-wales,Bristol,"I was a little disappointed with Clegg.  I thought he looked a bit tired, and it seemed as if he got too involved in some of the bickering.  When he did the whole ""yes or no, yes or no..."" thing he looked more like an ""old politician"" than either Brown or Cameron.  Having said that, I still think he was best out of the three (disappointment is relative to his past two performances - I had higher expectations).  I also don't think he defended some of the Lib's policies as well as he could have, especially on the immigration amnesty.

I thought it was Brown's best performance, but I still thought he was woeful.  I'm sorry, and I shouldn't say this and it shouldn't matter, but I really can't stand the guy.  He just rubs me up the wrong way.  He came across as being too political, I completely switched off for large parts whilst he was talking.  I've said it before on Reddit, but it's worth repeating, I feel as strongly against Brown and Labour as my parents did against the Tories in the 80s.  Another thing I've said before is that an incumbent government can't run a campaign on an underlying theme of change when they've been in power for 13 years!  We're not idiots.  If you could cut waste, what have you waited this long? Have you been *intentionally* wasting money all this time?

I thought David Cameron was thoroughly bland.  He consistently tried to misrepresent both Lib Dem and Labour policies (something Labour were also guilty of though).  He also did the best job of avoiding directly answering questions, and when I say best, I mean worse from my point of view because I think it makes him lok shady.  I also think the other parties were right to attack him on the, quite frankly, absurd inheritance tax cut that only benefits one tiny portion of society, which also happens to the the section of society that donates to the Tories (£2million last week wasn't it? They weren't low and middle income families making those donations, trust me).

As for the debate itself.  I disliked the set and I thought the selected questions were boring.  I thought the positive reaction Sky News got for the pope question would have encouraged the beeb to come up with something a bit more lively.  I feel like I've watched the same debate for the third time - if we're to continue with these debates, this has to be addressed.

The tone of this debate was markedly different to the first. They were all clearly a bit nervous and far quicker to resort to cheap attacks. 

Cameron was very sharp, but he also (somehow) managed to amplify his weaselly characteristics. He was very slick, but I felt as if the others were managing to expose some of his weaker policies. Whether others saw that too, I don't know.

Clegg was good, but unfortunately nowhere near as good as he was in the first debate. Seemed like he was trying to balance the ""good guy"" voice-of-reason persona with some cheap attacks, and I don't think he pulled it off. He snapped back at Cameron at one point in response to a question about his immigration policies and I felt it really didn't work for him.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; As before, the basic premise of the model is to explicitly shift votes from one party to another -- for instance, take a percentage of Labour's votes and give them to Liberal Democrats -- and then apply these vote shifts in a sophisticated way across the UK's 650 constituencies.

I am not a statistician, but I think this is seriously flawed.  It fails to account for all the newly registered, predominantly young voters, of whom the majority appear to favour the Lib Dems.

The [turnout at the last election](http://www.ukpolitical.info/Turnout45.htm) was 60%, the lowest ever in modern times.  20 years earlier it was 75%.  40 years before that it was 85%.  It is perhaps unlikely, but not inconceivable, that the turnout could be 80% this year (I like to think that the TV debates and closeness of the running have led to an interest in the election not seen in 30 or so years).  

Likely or not, it illustrates the folly of basing predictions on what happened 5 years ago.  At best you're accounting for 60% of the population.  But there could be anything up to another 20% of voters this time around.  Furthermore, the ones who stayed away 5 years ago are more likely to be apathetic voters who couldn't stand the thought of voting either Labour or Conservative.  Many more of those folk now see a credible alternative to old school politics in the Lib Dems.  Not to mention all the newly registered young voters who see the old school farts for what they really are.

Perhaps it's just wishful thinking on my part.

However, all such considerations paled in comparison to the debate ignited by your use of the word *apparati* . I initially took the position that *apparati* is the singular of *apparatus* and she took the opposite view.

Googling was inconclusive, leaving us more muddled than when we started, so she phoned her mother (in Germany) who phoned her friend who teaches latin (in England) who told her to tell us that actually *apparati* can actually be EITHER plural or singular depending on gender and case. So  its use in your post depends entirely on your intention, and as such no one but you can decide whether you used it correctly.)

He's made his mark and now he just has to remind people of the impressive points he's already made.

Surprisingly I felt Gordon Brown was a lot stronger in this debate but he still clearly is not the right person to run this country. Cameron has some good points also, but for me Nick Clegg and the liberal polices still make the most sense.

One of the things I noticed as well is that Clegg is very clever in the way he speaks to the camera. When Cameron or Brown is talking it feels more like they're telling the country what will happen, whereas Clegg makes you feel like he is actually one of the people and speaking like he will collaborate with you and isn't so caught up in the political leader lifestyle that he still understands what people actually need and not what MP's *think* we need.",0,1272628876,null,0,false,0,c0p5pnm,t3_by190,t1_c0p5pnm,t3_by190,null,1426292996,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Not just time though.  It HAS to move through space even if time traveling.  Look at it this way:

If I were to JUST travel forward in time for just a minute, I would suddenly find myself floating in space simply because the planet is moving and would now be farther along the path of its orbit.

That is of course unless you time traveled to EXACTLY the time where the earth made EXACTLY one revolution around the sun.
