I don't see how these two propositions a relevant for each other, so let's serve the German stereotype of being accurate:

Most means more than the half. The number of official inhabitants of Germany is around 81.7 millions [\[1\]](http://www.statistik-portal.de/Statistik-Portal/de_zs01_bund.asp). I don't know what qualifies as native German to you. Do you mean just a local, so basically someone who was born in Germany and has a German citizenship or do you mean someone who can trace his/her family lineage back to Germanic tribes? (Back to the First Reich? The Second Reich? The Third Reich? [...])

Let's assume that only every fourth inhabitant of Germany qualifies as ""native"". If that's the case, you claim to know that more than 10.212 million native Germans are pissed. 

I wonder how you met so many people in only 8 month and had the time to talk with them about their opinion about the Eurozone.

And the people consulting our politicians on it are bank managers who most likely know much more about the crisis, but not all. Much more important: They try to influence them in their interest, not in the public interest. Not that I think many people understand what would be best in the public interest. Certainly not me. Politicians, acting in their best self interest, and not really understanding much either, engage in populism and say the stangest things. Defending the Euro and giving money is also somewhat populist. Especially when you populance is the financial elite.

To give some of my insight (which isn't really much, I shouldn't really flatter myself): There are two things in debt. Implicit and explicit debt. Explicit debt is what is on the books. Implicit debt is the future obligations that arise from out social security and pension systems. This is not on the books. So when we are talking about debt, we don't even know much. In which way could this problem be talked? Better immigration policy to offset the declince in population perhaps? But can Europe really integrate enough people? Possible not with current mindsets and policies. But suddenly we are talking about immigration when we were talking about debt.

So back to the European debt crisis, which is mostly about explicit debt. For some reason financial markets worldwide believe that European countries won't be able to repay explicit debt (maybe because of implicit debt?) and are raising interest rates because of that risk. All European countries (and the US) need to borrow new money all the time. This is an interesting problem in itself and nothing new. 

There is so much more. About debt, confidence and policy measures. I believe the worst thing is that the financial markets expect another banking crisis, that will take down the rest of the economy, because this time the European countries don't have enough money for another bailout because of the debt crisis. This would significantly lower tax revenues (when the economy shrinks, we naturally have lower revenues) and hinder countries in repaying debts. So the debt crisis is cause and result at the same time. But only if you think the bank bailouts are really that bad.

Cette directive de 2000 est fondée sur l'ex-article 13 TCE (Amsterdam mais déjà, le traité de Maastricht donnait une compétence à la CE en matière de non-discrimination, sans préciser pour autant que ce principe recouvrait les cas de discrimination en fonction de l'orientation sexuelle), devenu l'article 19 TFUE (Lisbonne) selon lesquel ""Sans préjudice des autres dispositions du présent traité et dans les limites des compétences que celui-ci confère à la Communauté, le Conseil, statuant à l'unanimité sur proposition de la Commission et après consultation du Parlement européen, peut prendre les mesures nécessaires en vue de combattre toute discrimination fondée sur le sexe, la race ou l'origine ethnique, la religion ou les convictions, un handicap, l'âge ou l'orientation sexuelle"". Cet article me semble être le seule pouvant servir de base juridique pour traiter du cas des homosexuels. Mais, par exemple, la question du mariage n'est pas une compétence de l'Union européenne.


Concernant le cannabis, je connais un [arrêt de la Cour de justice qui traite de la question en terme de libre prestation de service](http://jmieurope.typepad.com/jmi/2010/12/tourisme-de-la-drogue-suite.html): la Cour a bien conclu que la législation de Maastricht limitant l'accès des coffee-shop aux résidents des Pays-Bas était contraire au principe de libre prestation de service mais que cette restriction était justifiée par l’objectif visant la lutte contre le tourisme de la drogue. De plus, l'ex-article 129 (Maastricht), devenu l'article 168 TFUE, a donné à l'UE une compétence (partagée avec les Etats membres) en matière de santé publique, mais le cannabis est plus envisagé comme une drogue contre laquelle il faut lutter. Je vois mal quelle pourrait être la base juridique permettant d'adopter une législation favorable au cannabis dans l'UE et, dans tous les cas, jamais une telle proposition ne pourrait passer au Conseil!


De plus, l'initiative citoyenne pourrait-il donner plus de visibilité au Parlement européen? Je pense que l'initiative citoyenne pourrait peut-être donner, de manière générale, plus de visibilité au processus décisionnel, encore que, tout dépend de la façon dont les médias traitent cette question: il est tout à fait possible qu'une ICE fasse l'objet d'une médiatisation massive au départ, mais que le sort réservé à cette initiative tombe dans l'oubli, en raison du temps écoulé entre la proposition et une éventuelle adoption. Ce n'est ici qu'un avis personnel évidemment: il faudra attendre la première ICE pour savoir véritablement quel sera son réel impact.


Dernière précision: le Parlement européen a, en quelque sorte, un pouvoir d'initiative depuis Maastricht. Selon l'actuel article 225 TFUE, ""Le Parlement européen peut, à la majorité des membres qui le composent, demander à la Commission de soumettre toute proposition appropriée sur les questions qui lui paraissent nécessiter l'élaboration d'un acte de l'Union pour la mise en œuvre de la Constitution. Si la Commission ne soumet pas de proposition, elle en communique les raisons au Parlement européen"".

Your objection is not unjustified, but this particular point is ridiculous.

1) Your *current* currency, the [pound sterling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling), has undergone multiple changes through history, and while the name has a long history, it is by no means the same currency as it was even 50 years ago.

2) British history and culture are not separated from, but are *part* of, the larger European history and culture. Establishing the European narrative is a primary goal of the European Union, including the Monetary Union. You may choose to view Britain as a separate entity from the rest of Europe, but it would not serve the purpose of stability, peace, and unity — the absence of which have plagued our continent (including the Isles) for over a thousand years.

You are right that all these things have changed, but they all changed *incrementally*, we very rarely just take something and throw it out completely, we attempt to improve and modernise it over time.

So perhaps we take our time, but we do change things gradually.

That's true, in the sense that the currency has the oldest name still in use. ;) One can argue what exactly makes a currency, but today's pound sterling does not have any similarities with the original currency, save for the name.

No, but I'm asking you to consider the arguments founded in reality, rather than focus on the emotional side of things. We all have long histories on this great continent, and while the British are especially good at forgetting the things they have no reason to be proud of, I think one of the things that we, including the British, *can* be proud of is the fact that we have overcome the tremendous struggles that plague our common history.

Meanwhile, you are completely right: Now is a terrible time to ask people to join the Euro, because its most serious problems are currently very visible. Hopefully, the current situation will lead to those problems being thoroughly solved, again hopefully making the Euro attractive for countries such as Britain and Denmark. :)

true,sadscience,EURO,UK,"Most of your points have been well made and very interesting, but I've got to challenge what you say about the European Parliament. It isn't '*tremendously* powerful', far from it. 

* Firstly it isn't the Executive, and cannot propose legislation (though I'm not saying you were suggesting that). The appointed Commission (usually under heavy direction from the Council) remains in control of that aspect of EU governance.
* While it does have a veto and it is necessary for the EP to vote on all legislation handed down to it from the Commission, the vote-threshold needed to amend or reject a bill is ~66% (a supermajority), whereas the vote required to pass is a mere majority (50%). I think this is a tremendous weakness, and it's why you see the centre-right and centre-left MEPs voting and collaborating together so frequently to gain super-majorities.
* The EP has to approve the President of the Commission, but it cannot hold a vote of no confidence, something that a 'normal' national parliament can.

There is a lot wrong with the EP in its current form, and just having more people take part in European elections isn't going to solve it. Simon Hix recommends having the President of the Commission drawn from the EP (parliamentary style), and there are other suggestions out there. I think a major change needed is to reduce the threshold for amendments. Having the only directly elected institution of the EU so constrained is pretty poor in my view.

P.S. The idea that the EP presides over '70% of the laws that get passed in Denmark [and Britain]' is shaky. [This blog post](http://www.jcm.org.uk/blog/2009/06/what-percentage-of-laws-come-from-the-eu/) is the best thing I can find that discusses what the true figure is (and concludes that there is no concrete figure, but that it certainly isn't &gt;70%). A particularly interesting quote from that blog post that I noted is that

&gt;6.3 percent [of legislation] according to the Swedish parliament, 12 percent according to the Finnish parliament and between 12 and 19 percent according to the Lithuanian parliament.

Which may be of interest to you as a Scandinavian. I think the 70% figure was originally coined by Jacques Delors when he was showing off about how powerful the EU was now.

true,DaRtYLeiya,null,null,"Now this is why I like countries like Sweden (and other Scandinavian countries). Not because they started a Pirate Party and that they actually get votes.

It's all because of the women. You see, during the Viking ages, the Vikings were fierce warriors that made excellent use of the seas. Raiding and pillaging everywhere. Other populations feared the Vikings so much, that they told Viking stories to their children to scare them (so that they would be good). You see, these Vikings were able to travel to and conquer distant lands. The legend of Vinland says that they even reached North-America.

When these fearless gods set foot on your lands, you did not have the power to stop them. As some tribes throw virgins in volcanoes to temper the gods, so did the European tribes offer their best virgins to the Vikings to save the rest of their people. All these beautiful women were taken home and served as child factories. Old and ugly women were responsible for cooking, cleaning and repairing clothes. They did not need medicine or antibiotics because even bacteria feared these tall-standing, hammer-wielding, greatly-haired dragon fighters.

Years and years of interbreeding with only the best of the best, led to the ultimate beauty of these people. Women have eyes blue as the oceans, hair that lights dark woods and a body to DIE for. Men are strong and fearless. They wield their long hairs like hard rock legends.

You see, if Anders Behring Breivik would have committed his crimes in a different country, nukes would be set off and wars would have started. But not with the Scandinavian people, no, these people kept their cool. And you know why they did? Because they are gods. They did not become irrational, they did not declare wars. They solved the problem and went on with their lives, because that's how Vikings do things. A problem occurs? They take action, erase the problem and get on with life.

If I ever become single again, I'm going to Sweden. I'm not a strong and manly kind of guy, but statistics show that Scandinavian women are looking for gentlemen. Years and years of Vikingsex makes these women want to find a guy that also holds the door open for them. And that's what I'm good at! I'd pray to the Viking gods to send me some Viking beauty to have warm and intimate Viking nights with.

The first point means that, if seats in Brussels are divided by population (or there is a single-electorate PV system), the smallest countries will be largely silenced, and if the seats are allocated per-country, the larger countries won't accept because of the loss of power.
I expect the solution is to have a bicameral system on the US or Australian model - I personally prefer the Canberra ""Washminster"" system (which has a Prime Minister as Head of Government and the ministers come from parliament) to the Washington system, but that's probably because the first system I understood was the Westminster system.

I would like to see the South Australian system used for elections - this is IRV for the lower house and single-electorate Hare-Clarke without some short-cuts the Australian federal system uses for the upper house. I prefer the Tasmanian model for national elections, but I think it would be unsuitable for a population as large as the EU's.

Perhaps you misinterpret ""the EU has so little power, the actual problems are with national governments"" as ""the EU can do no wrong"" -- sure it can, where it actually has power. Transmitting European flight data to the US, for example. But we can't blame the EU for how it handles Austria's government when no institution of the EU (neither the commission nor the parliament; and the council *is* the assembly of the governments) had any say in how the other governments reacted.

&gt; Indeed, in our little debate the other day you seemed to accept un-democratic behaviour as an ok, if not desirable thing. I find such views stunning. 

We may have a misunderstanding here. I don't endorse undemocratic behaviour, at all. We probably define ""undemocratic"" differently. The nations of the EU are generally considered democratic, so if a decision taken in these nations is legal according to their national set of laws, and survives being challenged in court, then it can be considered democratic. I also don't agree with some of the decisions taken that way, but that in itself does not make them undemocratic. Maybe you can tell me what you consider democratic and what not, because so far it appears to me like the distinction you make is arbitrary.

&gt; The EU has very many good points I agree but it is so far from perfect to be even worse than the governments many of us Northern Europeans are used to and I know the UK is not the best in terms of the Northerners either. 

The EC has a [blog](http://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/blog/index_en.htm), only for the UK (at least I haven't seen the equivalent blog for the rest of us), that debunks myths spread by the British media. Have you considered that you may be a victim of selection or confirmation bias?

&gt; So to answer your question, my arguments when made seriously in this subreddit are usually of a very good quality and I do try to back up what I say with sources - admittedly often wikipedia - which is a hell of a lot more than can be said for many folks here.

I don't think any of us should judge the quality of his own comments but it""s nice to see that you make an effort to use sources.

&gt; Have you considered that you may be a victim of selection or confirmation bias?

Yes I have,  I have purchased several academic books on the EU and how it is structured because it is of interest to me for many reasons. Not least because like it or not as part of the UK I am lumbered with it so I take my time to understand it. 

I am not anti-Europe, quite the contrary having spent a lot of time in the US over the years I find myself identifying less and less with our American cousins and do feel somewhat more homely with continental Europeans, at least on some issues.

However, I am very much in the euro-sceptic gang because the EU as it currently stands is truly shocking and an abhorent mess of legislation and bureacracy. It is hard to think of a rational group of people sitting down and coming up with what we have now.

Sadly, however during the growth of the EU it had to accomodate a lot of well, shit, from every country (France I am looking mostly at you). How the CAP is allowed to exist I have no idea. That should have been consigned to history decades ago. 

The EU is a political creature and one I think in which the actual people of Europe get very little say on what happens because it is being presented as a fait accompli by the political elites with very little opportunity to present or even consider alternatives.

true,boq,BAVA,near Germany,"&gt; This for starters that the EU courts do not strike this down under free market competition law is disgraceful. Similarly for electricity and power and other utilities. There is far too much protectionism within the EU given it is supposed to be a free-market.

Hm, I wasn't able to find a court case about that. Are you sure someone brought it before the ECJ? About electricity, I've seen a great increase in competition in Germany over the last years. I don't doubt that some areas try to remain protective but at the same time I'm sure Luxembourg's long arm will catch up to them eventually.

&gt; The semi-annual migration from Brussells to Strasbourg - the mind boggles at the waste here.

Yes, no disagreement from me there.

&gt; The way in which the EU constitution referenda were side-stepped by the treaty of Lisbon - with France, the Netherlands and Ireland all voicing not insignificant disapproval you'd have thought something would have happened.

Something did happen, it was rewritten to no longer be so invasive as to require referenda in most countries. I don't think this will happen again as even in Germany courts and politicians have made clear that substantial changes will now require a referendum. I'm looking forward to that because it should lead to a new, clean, treaty.

&gt; The stability and growth pact - it was a joke at best and broken by France and Germany.

&gt; The CAP is a massive bugbear, but right now I dont have my usual sources to hand (I'm at work). I appreciate I have mentioned the above serveral times recently but off the top of my head they are what spring to mind.

I don't know that much about the CAP, only that it's share of the budget is declining. About the pact, yes, you are right. Maybe that would have played out differently if the UK had been part of the Eurozone and been more thorough than France or Germany in abiding by the rules. Either way, the pact was toothless because politicians didn't have the political will to implement an actually powerful mechanism. Today it doesn't look like this will happen again.

&gt; pro-European press

This is probably the first time I have to completely disagree with you. From this side of the Channel there is little pro-European press in the UK at all. This statement is akin to the whining of American conservatives about the alleged liberal bias of all the media. There just isn't any.

&gt; The Tobin tax is a agood example, it has the potentual to kill the City of London - the general European response? ""who gives a shit"".

Gambling banks are one of the main reasons for the global crisis. I understand that Britain is protective of its banks but at the same time it is at fault for relying so much on that kind of business. A business that can't handle a per-mill tax increase is probably not sustainable forever. What would you like the mainland to propose instead?

All in all, this doesn't read like a list of show-stoppers or deal-breakers to me. Room for a lot of improvement, yes, but not for some of the vitriol that regularly appears. Britain loses a lot of political capital through its (perceived) position of total blockade that it could instead invest in changing the things you mentioned. I'm sure Germany would like to have an ally to get rid of the Strasbourg parliament but it can't convince France alone -- as an example.

There was no court case that's the problem. The list of ""protected"" companies was part of the some agreement, I forget which one, in which countries were allowed to make exclusions on security grounds. 

Around the time Pepsi was sniffing around Danone the French government slapped it on the ""protected"" list. From a commercial perspective there is no way in hell Pepsi are going to take on France in court, it would cost far too much. 

More to the point, why are either of those companies protected? And why hasn't the EU slapped Sarkozy about the face? It should not need to be contested in court that kind of action should draw automatic action from the EU. Now I know this is more of France's action than the EU's, but the point is that the EU has remained silent probably for political reasons; that is bad government.

&gt; even in Germany courts and politicians have made clear that substantial changes will now require a referendum.

I should hope so and I am glad to hear Germany is doing this, so long as the referenda allow the people to express their feelings I would be very happy. Another round of idiocy akin to Lisbon and I'll start burning camembert in Calais (or Dover).

&gt; I don't know that much about the CAP

Ignorance is undoubtedly bliss in t his case. Farm subsidies have a long and ignoble history but what has happened over the years in the EU with CAP should make every humanitarian weep. Next time you see a starving African from Kenya or other reasonably stable country, think of CAP - it kept EU farmers fat while killing millions.

&gt; Maybe that would have played out differently if the UK had been part of the Eurozone and been more thorough than France or Germany in abiding by the rules.

i seriously doubt it, Franco-German axis can out-power any other bloc. And IIRC I think the UK would have fallen foul of the same rules anyway.

The Gaurdian and the Independant are reasoanbly pro-european, though they do often sound like apologists for the UK on everything. I'm not saying the media is biased we do have quite a representative view in the UK, more so than much of Europe I think. 

&gt; Gambling banks are one of the main reasons for the global crisis. 

A tobin tax will not stop ""gambling"". Also, aside from the US mortgage market there was surprisingly little actual gambling. There was piss poor enforcement of legislation and risk management, but very little gambling. The Eurozone crisis has little to do with banks gambling and more to do with politicians not wanting to make hard choices.

&gt; All in all, this doesn't read like a list of show-stoppers or deal-breakers to me.

Indeed not, hence the exasperation. The EU is moving and continues to move more towards the crap kind of leglislative we have seen work so well in the Club Med countries. i admire Germany for having the political power to bail them out, but as far as things I want to be a part of hell no, pass me the Union flag and I'll start whistling Dixie.",0,1321883435,null,0,false,0,c31kbf1,t3_mjcx7,t1_c31kbf1,t1_c31k8tg,1427908908,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

This is how I understand America:

During the early years when America was still being colonised there was so much land and so many resources available that nobody really needed a government. You looked after your own ranch or whatever, and you may well have needed a gun to defend it! Who needs a government when you're totally self-sufficient? I think Americans are still naturally very suspicious of the government and view it only as a means for national defence and criminal justice. Anything else is just interfering, and Americans should be free to do whatever the hell they like.

Europe, and I hate saying Europe as we're talking about a continent containing 52+ countries, 100's of different languages and cultures but for the sake of argument, Europe on the other hand has had strong nation states throughout its entire history. We're naturally more inclined to look to the government not only for national defence and criminal justice, but also for organisation, arbitration, administering law and order, and (shock horror!) redistributing wealth. In Europe we see it as the government's responsibility to look after its citizens and make sure we live in a fair society.

I can understand both cultures, but I think ultimately the European culture allows for a fairer and ultimately more pleasant society to live in. I think the American culture not only breeds inequality, but also distrust and fear but then I am European maybe I am unable to truly appreciate the American side of the equation.

Emprunter sans payer d'intérêts, le plus gros mensonge des partis extrémiste. Bien sûr que si on avait emprunté sans intérêt on aurait moins a rembourser. Mais il ne fallait pas s'endetter autant pour commencer.

1) Who makes up the EU, and what their interests are.

2) What types of laws are handed down by the EU.

Again, the word ""sovereignty"" is wrong in this context, because the EP also consists of Danish representatives. More importantly, large countries such as Germany and the UK are *also* subject to the same laws, which gives smaller (and curiously enough often more sensible) countries such as Denmark a small chance to work on a common platform for initiatives that help *all* EU citizens. Furthermore, every law has to be ratified by the Danish parliament (as in every EU country), and it happens routinely that there is some debate surrounding a law, usually because it consists of a deregulation.

It is a myth created by the British tabloid that the EU is a platform in which countries egotistically work for their own good, at the expense of everyone else — indeed, it is a myth that countries even *have* separate goals! The EU is not a zero-sum game by any means — it is in the interest of all EU member countries that all other EU member countries do well — particularly within the Eurozone. If they don't do well, we end up with crises like the current one.

The fact that we are even having this discussion illustrates well the strong disconnect that exists between the British mindset and the European reality.

Banks are businesses, they encourage you to deposit your money with them, offering interest rates if you do so (effectively paying you money for your savings). However, banks make their profits from using the money you left in their hands to invest in companies, organizations or individuals, through the use of loans (credit).

Since your money is effectively re-invested elsewhere, the bank cannot give you all your money back tomorrow if you ask for it. It has some money free, but not enough. The spare cash is called the working capital.

Now when the banks made bad investments, they effectively lost your savings, not their own. And they don't have enough working capital to pay you back. Yes, the banks would have failed but you wouldn't have any money either.

So, you would have had no money, banks would not exist and businesses would not be able to acquire any credit with which to expand, or buy new stock, or employ people with etc. Effectively the economy would fucked. Thus, the government gave banks the money in the form of loans to write-off their bad investments and tried to allow them to function like normal so that this would only be a downturn as opposed to a complete collapse of our way of life.

Deuxième erreur. Je suis d'accord sur le fait que l'inflation est en soi néfaste. Je tends à penser qu'elle est un mal nécessaire, qui est de toute façon inévitable, que la création monnétaire soit reléguée aux banques privées ou à l'état.

true,DanoTheSnitch,IREL,Ireland,"Once again you are letting a populist agenda cloud facts and reality. Banks are a vital part of the economy, allowing companies to grow and do more business through advice and lending.

The idea that banks are just creaming off the hard work of everyone else is a pernicious falsehood spread by the previous government who were looking for someone to blame. Do you know why the sub-prime mortgage happened? A large percentage of the American population wanted to be able to buy homes but the banks wouldn't give them loans as they considered them too risky to lend to, The US government ordered banks to lend to people that they would not usually lend to and the US said that they would guarantee those loans for a time. Once the US government stopped guaranteeing the loan then, amazingly, people started to default on loans. So who is at fault there?

Now, if you've got USD100m owed to you over 10 years, guaranteed by the US government, you as good as have USD100m. So you can lend someone else USD100m against the proceeds from that loan. However, it the first loan isn't repaid, because the government walked away, all of the resultant loans are also going to default, and it precipitates a crisis

The bankers over-leveraged, there's no denial of that, but they are not the sole cause of the crisis, as they are being portrayed, nor are they all paying bonuses with tax-payers' money. The US government ordered banks to lend to people because they wanted their electorate to vote for them. If anything this whole mess shows one of the biggest flaws in democracy.

&gt;„Nach Eintreffen des Transports in Grafeneck wurden die eingelieferten Menschen in die Aufnahmebaracke geführt, dort vom Schwesternpersonal in Empfang genommen, entkleidet, gemessen, gewogen, fotografiert und dann zur Untersuchung gebracht. Diejenigen Personen, die Goldzähne besaßen, wurden besonders gekennzeichnet. Schließlich führte man die Menschen den Ärzten zur letzten Untersuchung vor. In manchen Fällen wurden dabei Beruhigungsspritzen gegeben, in den weitaus meisten Fällen dauerte die Untersuchung nur wenige Sekunden bis zu einer Minute. In Grafeneck nahmen sie die Ärzte Dr. Schumann, Dr. Hennecke und ab April Dr. Baumhard vor. Sie diente aber in der Regel nicht dem Zweck einer nochmaligen Überprüfung des Krankheitszustandes, um sozusagen auf diese Weise eine letzte Auswahl zu treffen, sondern sie wurde dazu benutzt, die sachliche und personelle Richtigkeit der vorgestellten Menschen zu überprüfen und auffallende Kennzeichen zu notieren, die für die Erstellung einer späteren Todesursache von Bedeutung sein konnten. […]
Nachdem die Untersuchung abgeschlossen war, setzte sich der Zug der Ahnungslosen in Bewegung. Den jetzt nur noch spärlich Bekleideten wurde zum Teil ein alter Militärmantel übergeworfen, dann ging es durch ein Tor im Bretterzaun, vorbei am rauchenden Krematorium, zum Todesschuppen. Die Tötung erfolgte durch Kohlenmonoxidgas, das der Anstaltsarzt durch Bedienen eines Manometers in den Vergasungsraum einströmen ließ. Die erforderlichen Stahlflaschen lieferte die Firma Mannesmann, die Befüllung besorgte die IG Farben-Industrie (BASF) im Werk Ludwigshafen. Beim Betreten des Vergasungsraumes wurden die Kranken, maximal 75 Personen, nochmals gezählt, sodann die Tore geschlossen. Anfangs schienen einige Opfer noch geglaubt zu haben, es gehe tatsächlich zum Duschen, andere begannen sich im letzten Augenblick zu wehren und schrien laut. Die Zufuhr des Gases betrug in der Regel etwa 20 Minuten; sie wurde eingestellt, wenn sich im Vergasungsraum keine Bewegung mehr feststellen ließ. […] Geraume Zeit nach der Vergasung öffneten Hilfskräfte, die Gasmasken trugen, die Flügeltore. Ihnen bot sich in der Regel ein schrecklicher Anblick: Die Körper der Toten und der Boden waren mit Stuhl, Menstruationsblut und Erbrochenem beschmutzt, manche Leichen waren ineinander verkrallt und mussten mit Gewalt voneinander getrennt werden. Dasjenige Personal, welches die Krematoriumsöfen bediente, deswegen manchmal auch ‚Brenner‘ genannt, war auch zuständig für den Abtransport der Leichen zu den Öfen […]. Vorher wurden den mit einem Kreuz bezeichneten Patienten die Goldzähne ausgebrochen und bei der Verwaltung abgeliefert; das so gewonnene Rohmaterial wurde sodann bei Degussa zu Feingold verarbeitet.""

Wie war so etwas möglich? Unter den Ärzten waren wahrscheinlich sowohl Christen als auch ""Nicht-Gläubige"". Beide ""Gruppen"" hatten allerdings kein Problem, diese Taten auszuführen. Moralsysteme können nämlich auch einfach den Umständen angepasst werden. Das Argument, dass es nur ein Leben ist, das man lebt, kann auch dazu benutzt werden um komplett verantwortungslos zu leben, da das Endresultat in jedem Fall das selbe ist. Bei religiösen Menschen ist zwar eine gewisse Furcht vor einer Bestrafung durch Gott gegeben; allerdings lässt sich der Wille Gottes eben in Glaubenssystemen leicht umändern (woran die katholische Kirche sich ja auch euphorisch beteiligt hat).

Was ich sagen will: Bei genauer Betrachtung kann man kein System als besser oder schlechter beurteilen. Beide haben Vor- und Nachteile.",0,1321890906,null,0,false,0,c31l2sc,t3_mjogo,t1_c31l2sc,t1_c31k8wq,1427909264,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

Il y a des règles précises et difficile à respecter pour y rentrer, et seul les ""amis de"" peuvent y rentrer. Tu peux comparer la régulation de 1930 à celle de maintenant, c'est quelques pavés en plus. Mais il y à une énorme dose de régulation qui favorise les comportement à risque.
Je suis on ne peut plus d'accord pour critiquer le corporatisme, plus que jamais, et la régulation du système bancaire, c'est aussi du corporatisme à bien des égards. Mais faut pas non plus se leurrer, il y a aussi des régulation qui causent les problèmes que l'on a aujourd'hui.
Note qu'une régulation ça peut aussi être une incitation à faire une chose plutôt qu'une autre.
Ya qu'à voir notre société où on dés-incite totalement à faire de l'épargne plutôt que du crédit.

Pour l'inflation, elle appauvrit globalement la population. Les gros détenteurs de capitaux, ce sont avant tout des investisseurs, s'ils perdent leurs capitaux, l'économie en patie. L'inflation c'est un impôt qui pèse sur notre tête. Rend toi compte, une inflation de 20%, ça pèse plus sur les pauvres ou sur le riches ?

Pour moi la loi de 1973, c'est un bouc émissaire. Le premier problème c'est que la dette est souveraine mais pas son remboursement. D'ailleurs quand l'argentine a fait défaut d'une partie de sa dette, eh bien une bonne partie était contracté pour des raisons très obscure, et oui ils ont eu raison de faire défaut sur certains bouts.
Je refuse de rembourser une dette contractée pour construire une sous marin bis, pourtant, je serais obligé par mes impôts.
Le deuxième problème, selon moi, mais mon avis est loin d'être partagé, c'est que le monopole de la monnaie est mauvais. Pour moi la monnaie doit être choisie par le peuple, et c'est par la confiance que le peuple accorde à sa monnaie que l'on acquiert une stabilité. La planche à billet, ou un intérêt restreint, pour un état c'est juste une manière plus simple pour faire n'importe quoi, un taux à 7% c'est une barrière un peu plus haute, rien d'insurmontable, la preuve vu notre dette actuelle.

C'est pas le train de vie des français, enfin c'est pas si simple. L'état est capable de pondre des lois, et ces lois sont capables des modeler le comportement des français. Il y à une part de vérité cependant, les français n'ont certainement pas choisit les bon représentants. Je suis pas forcément supporter de Bayrou, mais il avait déjà annoncé les problèmes de dettes en 2007 et en 2002. Il faut croire que les mensonges des grands partis ont plus de poids que des vérité difficile à entendre.
Je comprend que les français veuillent un état présent et providence. Mon avis c'est que moins il est présent, plus notre qualité de vie s'améliorera. C'est mon paris en tout cas.

Those are all pretty slow songs, which I usually don't listen to. But it's some of the best I know that have come out of The Netherlands.

Aaaaaand then there's pretty much everything from the band Mala Vita. One of the best live bands I know. The recorded versions of their songs are not as good as seeing them live, but still very awesome. My personal favourite of their songs is [Dobro Vece](http://youtu.be/Y8u7VnsJWcE). They usually sing in a mix of languages. Good example is [Plesi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CueKs5-LamI), in which they sing in English, Italian, French and Servo-croatian.

A new container ship costs, say, €100m. Your company doesn't have €100m. You need a way of getting that money so that you can build the ship. Once you've built the ship you can charter it out to some companies and start making money, eventually making enough money to repay the cost of the ship.

If you don't have €100m of equity just sitting around the only way to do it reasonably is theough a loan from a bank. The bank will offer their balance sheet to support the company. Without the bank that ship would never get built. It's not extracting money from the economy with little in return; it's allowing the economy to function.



That's standard banking. It's happened for centuries and is an effective way of doing things.

For someone who's already in the French system, it's pretty much guaranteed if you've validated your licence/bachelor (which is the 3 year diploma before a masters). For someone from the US, they'll decide based on his grades and courses. Check the university's website, go look at their licence program and see if you're missing anything.

You mentioned that your boyfriend got some bad grades but still passed? well in French universities you can pass classes if your overall grade for the semester (or even year) is good enough, even if you utterly failed some classes. But again, I'm not familiar at all with these processes for foreigners.

Normally you can't have some licence classes with some masters classes (since you're supposed to get your licence diploma before starting the masters degree), but for a case like his I'm not sure. If you were an exchange student, you could take whichever classes you want, but if you want to finish your studies here, they might want you to do it the normal way and may force you to do a (partial) year to complete what's missing for a licence.

When I said above there's no selection until 4th year or so, I was being conservative. In my university (Lyon 1), in the physics department, it's only to get to 5th year (2nd year of masters) that a board decides whether or not you can pass.

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"The timing of industrialization was key to the development of the political culture, and thus culture at large, of both Europe and the United States.

The UK was the first country to industrialize, followed shortly by the US, then by Continental Europe. In the UK and the US, industrialization occurred naturally, that is, without much governmental assistance, simply because it was a new phenomenon. British industrial goods at this time were far cheaper than French or German industrial goods, as they had no competition, thus it was necessary for government to help industrialization along in Continental Europe. This allowed the other European powers to level the playing field once more, in order to continue competing with Great Britain economically and militarily. Thus, society in Continental Europe began to agree that government played a useful and necessary role for the economy. In the UK and the US, the ideal of the entrepreneur or rugged frontiersman endured because of the lack of government assistance in industrialization.

Since then early 1800s, the UK has shifted closer politically to Continental Europe, while the United States has not. The reason is due to class conflict. Class conflict consumed Great Britain for much of the 19th and early 20th century. Unions and populist support for governmental intervention in and regulation of certain industries forced government to play a key role in the economy. This never happened on quite the same scale in the United States. This is largely due to two reasons. The firs being that racial tension consumed the United States in a far more extensive way than in the UK. Hell, we fought a war against ourselves over whether or not black people should be considered property. Class conflict never erupted in the same manner because of a somewhat higher religiosity in the United States. You, the lowly factory working peon, and your boss, the wealthy industrialist, both attend Church on Sunday morning and sell baked goods to raise money for your Church, constructing a sense of camaraderie between the upper and lower classes. The end result is that the UK has fallen somewhere in between the US and Continental Europe politically, though much closer to Europe. The Thatcher era produced a shift to the right, bringing the UK closer to the US than in decades past. The financial sector of the UK accounts for close to 30% of its GDP, and income inequality is much higher than Continental Europe, but still lower than the US.",0,1321916905,null,0,false,0,c31p4wd,t3_mk352,t1_c31p4wd,t1_c31khla,1427911196,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Loud talking. I've never thought of US culture as loud but I can see it. Will remember.

By Metro, I assume you mean bus or train? Yeah, I wish we had that rule here.

Customer service... I'm going for anything except business. So as long as I'm not out and out scammed, I think we're good there :)

Basic words. Will they at least look on me in pity if I try and fail? It's the trying part, right?

Maps? Psh... who needs 'em. That's what GPS is for.

Escalator rule, I wish people followed that here. It always made sense to me.

Bike lanes. That raises another question: how accessible is bike transportation there? Is it safe? Can I rent bikes like I saw all over the place in Ireland?

Wallet... I actually keep it in my left rear as opposed to right and I keep it very thin and sideways. You will NOT get it out without me knowing. Old trick my dad taught me.

As for the gypsies, I can respond in enough German to pass and make it look like I don't understand. As for my bags, I'll be taking two: a backpack (that I can lock) that has weatherproof flaps you HAVE to work at to open and an old heavy canvas military side pack that has snaps you have to wrestle with. When I set them down, I *always* wrap the straps around my legs. I know better than to travel with electronics and cameras without keeping in contact with them (thanks for the reminder though).

The string/flower/trick thing... thanks for the tip. I'll definitely keep it in mind... I have to assume that public embarrassment and shaming is the name of the game here. It doesn't work on me. 

In regards to your edit, one of the things I'm looking forward to is seeing what these other cultures are like from personal experience. 

Thanks for a well thought and detailed response!

It helps being Canadian, everyone loves Canadians. Seriously: this ties *directly* into the language thing. Yes, most folks in France have studied tons of English, but they really, *really*, **really** appreciate it if you make an honest effort to communicate in French. In general they are shy about their English because while their grammar instruction at school is really strong, the spoken components are not. Conversations will start like this (no, really):

You: Bongur
Them: ""Bonjour"" (in their head: *putain, merde of an Engleesh accent. Zis guy's gonna make me speak fucking Engleesh*)

You either keep on in French and they love you on the spot or you force them to speak English and they only just like you a little bit. 

If you make some effort, you'll be conversing in 6 months and fairly fluent within a year. Being Canadian, I *know* you have had more than enough French in school to get you started. Go out a lot, avoid English-speaking people, read lots of French comic books, and you'll be fine. And don't forget that 90% of your learning will come from **listening.**

* You don't know it yet, but you are a lucky, lucky bastard
* The French will often seem cold and formal, especially when they don't know you. This is normal and acceptable. They are far more discreet and reserved than we are in North America, so don't let it get to you. They aren't being impolite or rude, it's just not their deal to put on a hyper-friendly song and dance for a total stranger like we tend to do.
* Getting a bank account is a pain in the ass without a fixed address and a fixed address is impossible to get without a bank account. May the force be with you.
* You have one year to transfer your driver's license. Don't fuck around about it. Go looking for the ""la préfecture"" to get it done straight away.

I could go on and on... Feel free to send me more questions if you have them.

It gets us out of the worst idea since the last one. The key problem with the EU is that it is a political entity which is bent to try and suit everyone. 

The eurozone was doomed from the minute it was formed, it was hardly a secret that Greece had fiddled the numbers, nor Italy, Spain and Portugal for that matter. It was not a secret that those countries used ""creative accounting"" in order to qualify. Yet it went ahead because of the political choices that were made - primarily between France and Germany.

&gt; And that's why Britains pro free market voice is needed so much in the EU.

I wouldn't say we are a lone voice but we are in an absolute minority with this opinion. The main other free-market countries are smaller and northern. France has and always will be protectionist, Club Med countries still have too many protected industries and too many vested interests in keeping things that way. Take a look at the train drivers / rail workers union in Greece. I admire their power but it disgusts me how they abuse it.

true,JunCTionS,null,null,"Obvious answer: Alhambra, buy tickets online with at least a couple of weeks in advance because they run out days before and every time I've been there I've seen a long line of people that don't get in or just get in to the gardens and not the Nasrid palaces.

The [Sierra Nevada](http://www.sierranevada.es) is a very nice and sunny ski site that is about 30 minutes away from Granada. There are buses that get you there from the city's bus station, and you can rent everything you need there.

¡Tapas!, Granada's very famous for the fact that at most bars (and that means literaly thousands of establishments in the city) give you a plate of food for free when you buy a beer (or soda, both normally between 1.7€ to 2€ each). Some good ones even let you choose what you want and some are absurdly generous (three beers and you'll have to unbutton your pants).

As every Spanish town does, there's an important Cathedral and historical city center. You probably want to see that, walk around, see if any events are going on (Granada has a very active cultural life), maybe eat some churros, and all that.

I really recommend the [science park](http://www.parqueciencias.com/) (I'm a geek, I know, but I've been there many times now and I asure you it's very well done). It has very good temporal exhibits and an amazing Birds of Prey workshop which you shouldn't miss. I'd go early from tuesday to saturday because you might end up short of time from all the things to see.

There's the city sightseeing bus, I find it nice to get an overview of the city. Plus doing tourism while sitting is welcome after many days of walking the sights.

There's a nice Tourist Pass promotion by Caja Granada which includes the entrance to the Alhambra, to the Science Park, Cathedral, Caja Granada Museum, Monasteries, and some discounts. This is what I recommend and you can buy it in advance (to secure your entrance to the Alhambra) on [their webpage](http://caja.caja-granada.es/Apli/bononuevo/mainEN.htm).

If you don't want the tourist  pass you can [buy the tickets to the Alhambra directly](http://www.servicaixa.com/nav/landings/en/mucho_mas/entradas_alhambra/entradas.html). Note that in order to retrieve them you must bring the credit card you paid with.

The sightseeing bus doesn't go to the maze-like streets of El Albaicín, my recommendation is, get down in the cathedral, and walk to the ""Calle Calderería Nueva"" and then up the ""Cuesta de San Gregorio"". You'll probably get lost, but if you keep going up you'll probably end up near the very famous sightseeing spot ""Mirador de San Nicolás"". If you're not up to getting lost in the white walled maze that is the Albaicín, you can catch the ""Alhambra"" buses 31 or 32 from the Cathedral, but you must go to the mirador, where you can see most of Granada, the Alhambra and the Sierra Nevada in a very nice panoramic view. Depending on your luck, the site might be overcrowded, if this is the case, most people don't know that they can freely enter the mosque that is right to it's east, plus the mosque itself is pretty.

Finally, Granada is basically a student city, so there's a very busy night life in some streets. Pedro Antonio Alarcón is one of them (I'd say the main one) and closer to the center is Calle Elvira. You might want to look into some of the night clubs that cater more to the ""Erasmus crowd"" if you don't speak Spanish and want to meet young people from the rest of Europe. El Camborio is one that is a bit far away but has an amazing setting with the bottom floor being actual caves and the upper floors having an amazing view of the Alhambra. Bus 35 will get you there early in the night. You'll probably end up walking down. Be careful both in the Albaycín and Sacromonte, for these are the most dangerous tourist places in Granada, but by this I mean some kids might try to snatch your camera or bag. I've walked around there many times after 4am and nothing bad has ever happened.

Good luck on your trip, have a good time and ask me anything else.

You are also assuming that lending can only be done through banks. The modern banking sector is not centuries old, it is about a century at best, ever since the banks convinced everyone that you should keep your money in a bank account (conveniently failing to explain exactly what that entails) and retail banking was born. Centuries ago, some aristocrat taking out a loan from one of his aristocrat friends to build a ship was not inherently risking the megere capital of his workers through a system of financial engineering designed to make it look like he wasn't, but today he does.

So assuming we want to keep playing the capitalist game we need a banking sector that actually transfers information accurately by not putting up a facade of ""safe place to keep your money"" and looks like the bond market it really is.

Stepping further back though we should consider, is the banking sector really efficient? Most payments between companies are on credit, with payments settled at the end of the month or quarter; this is done by armies of accountants at both companies.

I would just make sure you choose a university in a big student city, with many other education institutions nearby (they usually form a group and pool some resources. Paris has several different groups).

I don't know if you have a plan for your accommodation, but it's quite expensive here. This region is very touristy in the summer, mainly because of the weather. Don't even try to live in Monaco unless you've very rich or have a government help.

There are a lot of foreigners here, especially British. Lots of them don't even try to learn French, don't do that, we don't like it. Given the community of foreigners, there are a lot of opportunities made to learn French.

Concerning meeting people, I don't know how it is for an expat, you should ask WY_in_France I guess. Nice is a big city, lots of bars/pubs and a nice old town. Other cities around are nice to hang out as well.

One thing: this region is really beautiful (and it's not because I'm from there :-). Don't stick to Nice and Monaco (although Nice is cool, but you could ""visit"" Monaco in an afternoon). The coast is great, go around, visit the old towns like Cagnes-sur-Mer, Antibes, Cannes… But don't miss the mountains. Within an hour drive, you can go in the national parc of Mercantour for hiking, picnic, doing via ferrata, or skiing in the winter… The villages in the back country are very nice as well.

true,Marogian,UKGB,United Kingdom,"The problem isn't only about high debt. Its about low growth, high debt coupled with short-term maturities and relative size and strength of the states' banking sectors.

A state with low growth and high debt can enter a debt cycle where it eventually becomes unable to pay the interest on its debt, let alone pay off what it already owes. Equally a state with high debt exposure may be unable to bailout its banks if any of the larger ones go bust- it'd have to borrow a shit tonne to do this and this could push it over the edge, which is what the markets are afraid of. I'd want a high interest rate on any money I was owed by a country which I thought has a fair chance of defaulting in the future due to any of its banks going bust.

This is made worse by all these countries being tied together by the Euro. Germany keeps the currency unnaturally strong for most other countries which means these weaker countries owe more relative debt; Germany gets massive benefits from the corollary: the Euro is weaker than a pure Deutschmark would be so Germany's exports are much stronger. This isn't a German policy, just a result of being tied together in the Euro.

The low growth situation is also made even worse because the ECB keeps the interest rate high, which keeps inflation low- which is good for Germany and other states- but terrible for countries with high debt. High interest rates are also bad for countries which need to grow back the damage they had in the recession- you need cheap credit to take back the capacity which was lost. A country which has high debt can also inflate its way out of debt which means the interest damage is minimised- see Britain, for example. Our inflation is painfully high the last few years, but this has kept out debt interest payments down.

Inflation is bad sure- it hurts the average joe, but its certainly better than the state defaulting and the knock on effects this has.

High inflation is also being caused in the UK by Quantitive Easing- the BoE is effectively printing money to buy Government debts, pushing down the interest rates (which again is a huge help- UK bond yields are  very close to Germany's despite having a significantly weaker economic outlook and larger deficit) but also pushing up inflation and supposedly powering growth (although I'm sceptical of that). I don't think you'll ever see a politician admitting that the Quantitative Easing is intended to stoke inflation because inflation is a naughty negative word, but I doubt they see it as a net negative effect right now, particularly when the UK private sector is also heavily indebted.",0,1321992752,null,0,false,0,c31y5tz,t3_mlndg,t1_c31y5tz,t1_c31x7vv,1427915643,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

There is no neo-nazi underground and there is no terror from right-wing groups in germany that wasn't there before. While i am in no way implying or saying that the crimes comitted by these particular people are irrelevant, this simply is not terrorism and it isn't a danger to the population as a whole. Lets see if i can get my point on this clear:

First, anybody can do this and its no suprise that the police and agencies struggled with this, because of two reasons. If i would get a unregistered gun from somewhere and kill somebody who doesn't know me, has no connection to me whatsoever and if i avoid any physical contact with the victim, chances are very high to get away with it. 
Almost all murders are comitted by people who knew each other, if only briefly, or are carried out because of a planned or desired physical contact between the victim and its killer, i.e. rape or robbery. But in this case, there are no traces, so its very hard for the police to catch the killer. The other reason is, the three supposed ""terrorists"" never openly declared their goals, agenda or targets, which is because they probably never had any of those. 
For all we knew a few months ago, these murders could have been comitted by other immigrants, or the Mafia or almost anybody. So, if their goal was to terrorize someone, they certainly failed to get the message straight. 

This is a world apart form the terrorism the RAF put up in the 70s and even they were not particulary successful. So please, by all means, don't let the political/media outcry scare you.

Yeah, right. Just so /r/Europe can fully appreciate what the government coalition's junior partner is doing here, they ran on the tax cut ticket during the last elections.

If you look at GDP - expenditure [here](http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=350) for Q2 of 2011, you may be surprised. Estonia followed by Ireland followed by Poland. Of course this is just one metric and [Estonia has a GDP roughly 24.5x smaller than Sweden and roughly 25x smaller than Poland.](http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:SWE&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=gdp+of+sweden#ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country&amp;idim=country:SWE:POL:EST&amp;ifdim=country&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en) (Estonia's GDP growth rate rose from -14% (2009) to 1.8% (2010))

If you look at the [2010 A.T. Kearney FDI Confidence Index](http://www.atkearney.com/index.php/Publications/foreign-direct-investment-confidence-index.html) you'll see that Germany is in fifth place worldwide, with Poland in sixth. France is 13th, Romania 16th, and the Czech Republic in 17th. [PDF link](http://www.atkearney.com/images/global/pdf/Investing_in_a_Rebound-FDICI_2010.pdf) (some interesting reading)

Poland also (sorry a little bias here) was the only EU country in 2009 with [positive GDP growth](http://www.wbj.pl/article-55911-can-poland-remain-a-green-island.html) and even now with the Eurozone crisis (we aren't a member of the Eurozone, but it affects all of the EU) we still have decent growth (although I expect it to decrease a bit). We also may have the largest source of [shale gas in Europe](http://www.gasstrategies.com/files/files/euro%20shale%20gas_final.pdf) (PDF link - page 3) and if France doesn't stifle us with[ EU bureaucracy](http://euobserver.com/7/114338) (fracking may be harmful to the environment) we may have a very strong economy in the next few years. Overall, I say Poland is in a good position economically and will be in an even better position in a few years.

Sweden should be fine economically (unless the 2008 crisis repeats sometime soon, but even then you'll be in a better position than others) with your high GDP growth rate. (5.5% in 2010, over 7% now)

As an Ukrainian, I want to apologize for my compatriots; sadly, some people are rather rude here.

I think the root cause is that soviet leadership moved a lot of people around, basically, they've built lots of new factories and invited the most adventurous workers from Russia and other countries, or in some cases forcibly moved them. And as people were detached from their native cultural environments they kinda lost their cultural identities, and in a new mixed environment the only common thing was work... And, later, Soviet Union collapse didn't help either -- it, again, moved a lot of people, disrupted their cultural environments etc.

But it is different in different regions, people in the western parts are mostly Ukrainians and they are generally friendlier and closer to Europeans (particularly, nearby Poland). OTOH eastern parts have lots of ethnic Russians and heavily mixed culture.
