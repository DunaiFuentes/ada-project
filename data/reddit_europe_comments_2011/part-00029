Next semester you'll need to take advantage of it right away because it's best in Summer and that'll go away pretty quick! Get out and about, go out on the lake. Get to the beer gardens, etc. It gets damn cold there in Winter, especially by the lake.  But there is one good thing about Winter: the Weihnachtsmarkt.

To be honest, it's a real mixture. Konstanz sits in an area where you get a mix of Swabian (oder schwäbisch auf Deutsch), Badisch and Swiss German. There is even a local ""Konstanzisch"" dialect, but I think that's dying out. The majority are Swabian though. You won't have too much of a problem, you just have to get used to it. They do have some different words for things though, and sometimes like to simplify things e.g. ""Bitte Schön"" to ""bitsche"". So don't be offended if you hear this, they're not calling you a bitch ;)

Also, Bavaria is just across the lake, I have heard tiny bits of Bavarian creep in. The oldies around the town like to say hello with ""Grüß Gott!""

Swabian is indeed cute, it's fun to learn if you find someone who wants to help. I did have the most trouble understanding my Badisch speaking hausmeister. And, Swiss German... well, yes. Don't feel bad not understanding them, even native Germans have trouble understanding them (for real, just think of trying to understand a strong Irish or Scottish accent and you'll get the general idea). Luckily they mostly just come to Konstanz to do their shopping (it's cheaper in Germany plus they get stuff tax-free) and otherwise stay in Switzerland (even though the border goes through the town).

Edit: Also, Swabian get a much better wrap in the rest of Germany than Bavarian does, so if you pick up pronunciations or sayings, you won't be stigmatised. My best friend decided that Swabian was to German as Australian English is to Standard English. We shorten things (arvo instead of afternoon) and have strange sayings, and it's generally never perceived as a negative thing thing to have that accent.",0,1307333838,null,0,true,0,c1y0orr,t3_hsdh7,t1_c1y0orr,t3_hsdh7,1427216483,6,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,6

If it was, politicians all over Europe could score big time with the electorate by letting the banks take a hit, and nationalizing those that can't take it. If it only was about Greece's dept, then this would be cheap, relatively speaking.

The problem is that a Greek default would have an immediate effect on the already damaged creditworthiness of Portugal and Ireland, and could even pose problems for Spain especially and possibly even Italy.

So, a whole lot of banks would get into trouble, and not just the ones exposed to Greek debt. That debt is huge relative to Greece's GDP, but to put it bluntly, compared to the total assets of the European banking sector, it's not all that much. For example, last year the exposure of German banks to Greek government bonds was [$22.7bn](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-05/german-banks-top-french-with-23-billion-in-greek-debt-bis-says.html). Commerzbank is generally considered to be the largest of those creditors, and it alone has assets worth more than €750bn (note: euros, the other figure is in dollars).

The banks are threatened not by direct exposure, but through network effects. The fear is that a Greek default might cascade through the banking system just as it happened when Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail. Even this could be handled -- but if Spain or Italy get into trouble due to raising interest rates, then ""problem"" would be an understatement.

Simply put, the issue here is that should Greece default, nobody would know what would happen next. It's possible that a couple of banks would take hit, and that's all. But it's also possible that it would turn Really Ugly(TM).",0,1307359272,null,0,false,0,c1y26hs,t3_hsdb2,t1_c1y26hs,t1_c1y1xzg,1427217175,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

You acknowledge the fact that crime should be punished but you're actually making no point as to why punishing didn't occur OR why so little people cared about the bail out while now every Günther, Francois and William throws stones at the Greeks and their protest. 

I am shocked that Europeans in those numbers don't understand why those protesting Greeks (and hopefully millions who don't protest but agree) are upset, angry and looking for answers as to why they have to carry all those harsh measures, and honestly xenophobic criticism of their way of life WHILE the fat cats got bail out without any questions.

The scale of the 2007-2010 (and for many still running) financial meltdown and crisis is beyond doubt one of the most serious occurrences in our times. And still not only did it leave a huge hole as to what actually changed in the regulation of our financial system, it also proved that there is no way we can punish anyone or any institution responsible. The new age untouchables.

And here we are, being buried under news of how imperfect the Greek system is, an avalanche of cheap newspaper populism and back closet nationalistic intolerance about how they've brought that upon themselves and how there's exactly zero sympathy from anyone from the big ""family"". All while the *I'm-so-informed-what-the-Greeks-did-wrong-financially* people don't even have an impression as to what went wrong a couple of years ago that led to this situation.

I totally agree that the austerity measures (partially) and tax increases can only be counterproductive -- after all, you can't raise taxes on those who evade them anyway, and the ones that have to pay them don't have enough as it is.  
To me it seems like this is being done for two reasons. One is political, because a backlash in the form of raising populist anti-EU parties would be devastating for everybody involved, and the other is that they want to buy time for the other peripheral countries to stabilize enough for what seems inevitable.

Aix En provence is a wonderful town but quite uptight, there's a LOT of students, the law and politics university is ancient and famous, it shapes the city as a clean safe place, althought expensive somehow.
Marseille is a very special city, unique, but very close to the mediterannean (italy, north-africa, greece ...) influence, it's a harbour city, so expect to see a lot of different cultures and people, it's far more popular and proletarian than Aix, try to go there with someone who knows the city as it can be unsafe in some areas, but there are nice walks to do.
You'll also see that there's a ""mediterranean"" temperament, it's disturbing at first, but once you're accustomed, it's funny and very friendly ; people tend to shout at each other and emphasize a lot, even cursing a lot, often grave insults, you'll feel they're going to kill each other. The next minute, they'll be kissing each other (on the cheek, like any french does), and sharing a drink, laughing about the altercation and remembering old times.

Last I heard was that there are around €18bn in Bruxelles with Greece's name on it, but the government isn't even capable of coming up with projects that qualify. That's free money, not a loan.

It's not that there are no projects that qualify. Greece is full of people with great ideas. 

The problem, as I understand it, is this: Let's say there is European funding for a project, to build a small hospital in a remote island for instance. The guy responsible for talking with Europe about the funds, is usually a minister, a secretary general of a ministry, or some other bureaucrat with a high position in the ruling party.

This guy will not initiate the procedure to get the funds, until he is sure that his friends take a piece of the action. If for instance there are 3 different competing companies for the contract, unless his friend's company is chosen, he will not sign of the papers. In return his friend will fund the reelection of his party.

Now you would expect (and many Greeks have been assuming that this will be the case), that when the other big party is voted in, this guy will end up in jail. Of course this doesn't happen, because the other party's guys are corrupt as well and want their piece of the action. 

What about justice? Well, high level judges and DAs, are appointed by the government, and therefore have a vested interest in not prosecuting those that ""feed"" them.

So in the end the funds stay in Bruxelles, or if the people of the island are lucky they get half the original hospital, in double the price.

So how come these people get reelected again and again? Part of the reason is that people individually benefit sometimes, although I think this has changed over the last decade. The other part of the reason is that the electoral law in Greece is so messed up that it almost guarantees stable governments, with relatively small percentage of the popular vote. The current government got about 43% in the last elections (30% if you factor in the abstention and the invalid votes), but it had 160/300 MPs. The first party gets a 40 seat bonus with the current law, and will get 50 seats with the next for fucks sake!

All in all, I think Greece is not a democracy, but a parliamentary oligarchy, and I believe that the problem is mainly political, and in a lesser extent economic. ",0,1307368272,null,0,false,0,c1y2opd,t3_hsdb2,t1_c1y2opd,t1_c1y2j12,1427217404,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

That is 1 million out of 10 million men, women, children, retirees, so maybe almost 20% of the entire workforce. A big problem with greece being able to balance their budget is because they have so many people on the payroll, who do not want to give up these nice jobs. 

Second, among those who aren't in gov, many many are self employed. Hardworking? Yes. But tax evasion is a national art for these small businesses. Anyone who lives in greece knows that you simply don't pay taxes if you aren't some corp. Everything is in cash, transactions are never put on receipts, and tax collectors are paid off. Without tax revenue, the greek govt is stuck between huge commitments and no money to pay those off. 

Both of these are directly the greek people's fault. You can blame other factors (culture of corruption or whatever, intl financiers, etc), but when 20% of greek workers refuse to give up their ridiculous govt salaries, and another 30+% refuse to pay taxes, then how can you avoid pointing a big finger at them?

1. Lots of convenience stores (like, er, Tesco Express over there) have these little penny containers at the check out. The idea is that you have an extra penny or two, you can drop them in to keep them out of your pocket. And if you're short a penny or two -- like if something rings up to $2.02 -- you can grab a couple of pennies from the container to keep from ending up with 98 cents in coins.

2. Then a company called [Coinstar](http://www.coinstar.com/) started putting these coin-counting machines in supermarkets everywhere. The idea is that you can dump a whole bucket of coins into the machines, and it all gets counted and gives you 'real money' (as in, paper and not coins)  in exchange. The way they make their money is either by taking a commission on what you exchange or, more recently, by giving you the option to get gift cards (like with Amazon) for the full value, which they presumably get kickbacks from the merchants on.

&gt; Hi !
My postcard is filled with the faces of Larzac [1] farmers. I wish to tell you about the very special place I live in : Larzac.

&gt; It's a harsh land for man, where sheeps have been grazing for centuries. It all changed between 1971 and 1981 when Larzac became the center of a farmer's rebellion, to the point where people were coming from everywhere in Europe to join the locals.

&gt; This fight gave birth to altermondialisme [2] with José Bové as a figurehead. Larzac is a land of freedom and global protest. Lately, rebellious Larzac stood up against the exploration and extraction of shale gas. This fight goes on.

&gt; For sure, you won't find extraordinary landscapes or white sand beaches here, but men and women with a strong personality. Men and women with legendary tenacity and generosity. They are land's soldiers. Catholics and revolutionaries. In this land of Larzac, we brewed new alternatives for ""living together"" and ""living better"".

I am Greek (not an economist though), and my opinion is that the best option (from a bunch of really lousy ones) we have is to default. Banks will loose a lot of money, but this is not my concern. If the European states want to bail out their banks they should do it directly, and not by using Greece as an excuse.

maybe they are just encountering the people in front of mont martre selling shit really aggressively? maybe they are the ones being culturally insensitive and not following norms (for instance, saying bonjour/bonsoir before talking to someone)? maybe i just have thick skin and dont let it ruin my life if someone isnt 100% polite with me? i really can not understand how paris has such a bad reputation. 

in my opinion, tourists only get annoying when they are blocking escalators (on the right side) or walking really slow in a group of 10 taking up the whole sidewalk. talking in english isnt a big deal because everyone knows english. taking pictures in front of monuments is cool too, most people are tourists at some point in there life, its easy to understand. if you use common courtesy (which is pretty standard in any western country) you shouldnt have too many problems.

Yes, that is exactly what I said: 

&gt; The rest has gone to the banks that lent Greece.

I will edit my post to make it a bit more clear. 

All I am saying that if we had defaulted, we would not need a loan of 110bn euros from the European taxpayers, to pay back previous loans. There would be a deficit of 8 bn, but this could be found by restructuring the Greek economy, that I (and almost everybody else) admit is needed.

Sure it would be very difficult for some years in Greece, and it would not be able to borrow, but there have been examples of countries that defaulted, and were able to borrow after a few years, in the recent past (Argentina, Iceland).

As for development, there is no development in Greece right now. The 110bn is not for projects, or constructions. It is just to keep Greece from defaulting tomorrow.

You have to realize that the Turkish immigrants in Germany were (almost) all from the lower class when they left their country, so there are lots of archaic views about religion, family structure, nationalism.

The development of parallel societies in the big cities ensured that entire generations have a huge language disadvantage, which leads to less education, less likelihood of finding work outside of their cultural circles. Without knowing the language, integration is impossible.

Demographically, we are past the point of ""fixing"" this. The guest workers were never supposed to settle here, or bring their families. Now with over 4 million Turks here, the consensus is that integration efforts have to be stepped up immensely.

Socrates and the Socialist Party were punished because they were one of our worst governments ever. One that indebted our country in 6 years as much as all the other governments put together since we became a democracy in 1974.  
  
The parties that won the election and will have the majority to form a government PSD and PP were the only other 2 parties that signed the deal with EU, IMF and ECB troika, furthermore, the Socialist party was a minority government and all austerity measures were passed with the help of either PSD or PP. 

This clearly shows the Portuguese are NOT against working seriously to solve our problems, living within our means and paying our debts. We are against being lied to, told that everything is fine, not doing what is needed until it is too late and in the end having the shame of asking for help and having to solve all our problems in a much more hurtful and shorter timeframe.  
  
So why are Portuguese angry with the socialist party? Well the Portuguese were warned by concerned citizens as far back as 2005 (quite earlier than the international crisis) that we needed to urgently cut our expenses. In the last election, just 2 years ago, Socrates and the Socialist Party won against an opponent that was telling us we needed to urgently fix our budget. What was the Socialist Party doing in the mean time? Raising wages, telling us everything is A-OK and being incompetent, digging us deeper into the hole in the process.

true,CountVonTroll,null,null,"Yes, there is a problem with integration, and you pretty much hit the nail on the head:

&gt; To me it sounds analogous to some of the integration problems and/or social inequalities over generations that have resulted in despair, hopelessness and ultimately poor conduct among some minorities here in the states.

This effect is amplified by the German school system, IMHO. There is a stromg correlation between the education of the parents and that of the kids, at least in Germany. Part of it is that lesser educated parents tend not to value education all that much, or simply are unable to give their kids the support they need. If the parents don't speak the local language, or don't speak it well, it's even worse, and the original Turkish immigrant generation was literally hired off the streets in often remote regions, so many of them had no education whatsoever.  
There are similar issues with lack of intergenerational mobility within a section of the native ethnic German population, but since minorities tend to be easily recognizable, stereotypes develop, and the resulting antagonism is obviously counterproductive for integration, which leads a part of the minority to reject the native population, which is again is bad for integration, and so on.  
Germany until recently had no integration policy, so yes, there are problems on both sides, and it will take time to fix this. Education is key here -- Turkish-German engineers integrate easily.

There are regional differences, but here are [some stats](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Berufsabschl%C3%BCsse_Berlin_Spiegel_42-2009.png) for Berlin. Ethnic Germans are left, Turks and Turkish-Germans are center, Vietnamese and Vietnamese-Germans are on the right. Green means college, blue means vocational school or other professions, red means no training. Depending on where your wife is from, it might be similar.

Unfortunately your wife's views are much more common than I'd like to admit, and also unfortunately in no way limited to the extreme right, or even conservatives. So, I'd be careful with calling her a Nazi, especially since you don't know what her personal experiences may have been.

It's a way of standardising certain aspects of life in all countries.

Hi!

My postcard is first of all full of the faces of the peasants of Larzac. I am going to tell you about my country that is like no other place, Larzac. It’s a rough land for man, where sheep have been grazing for centuries. But from 1971 to 1981, Larzac became a land of peasant revolts, so much that people came from all over Europe to fight with the Larzacians. The revolutionary fight went on with the birth of anti-globalist ideas, with José BOVÉ as a guide. Larzac is a land of freedom and wordwide rebellion. Lately, rebellious Larzac has awakened to fight against schist gaz search and mining. The fight goes on. Sure enough, there are no paridise-like points of view, no white-sanded beaches in Larzac, but there are men and women who have a character. Men and women whose generosity and fierceness are legendary. They are fighters of the earth. They are catholic and revolutionary. In this country of Larzac we have invented alternatives to “live together” and “live better”.

true,spadaleone,null,null,"Hey, I am a so called Turkish-German. life as an immigrant in germany is not easy. Its not that the german people are nazis (Its so complicated, i could write a whole book about it) but theres still racism against strangers, especially against turkish people. The major part of the immigrants are turkish.

 I think that the story of my family explains a lot: My father and his parents arrived in germany when he was just 16. They came to work and had big dreams (probably like the american dream). But they were only disappointed by the people and the government. Just imagine: they had to live in a former pigsty and the situation of other immigrants were not better probably even worse. They were treated like robots and not like humans and were exploited and so on ...

I remember the first years of nursery school: as a kid i didnt recognize yet that im so ""different"" than the other kids. Kids dont care much about how u look. Many times they dont even ask what ur name is. They just start playin and laughin. But when i saw how their parents were comin everyday to collect their kids things started gettin different. I mostly had to go home alone cause my parents had to work. And even if they collected me it was kinda embarassing for me cause my mother was standin there alone while other parents were talking with each other. Sometimes they even made fun of her cause she wears a headscarf. When we were talkin Turkish other kids started laughin and asked whether this was even a language while their parents just looked amused. though she never cared about them and looked at me just smilin it was embarassing for me. I honestly hated her for being different and I didnt want her to collect me anymore. I was ashamed of my own culture and people. 

So i stopped speakin turkish, copied their lifestyle and told them people that im german; typical behaviour of people with an inferiority complex which is still a big problem of immigrants. I kept this behaviour till highschool. Though i was like them they always let me feel that im different. They still made jokes about my culture and my religion. They still called me ""kanacke"" (thats what they call us immigrants here, maybe comparable with ""nigger"" but not that bad) and ordered me to take away the rubbish and silly things like that.

 Kids never invited me to their parties cause their parents considered that i would have a bad influence on their children (though i was the most social child in class). The teachers still told me that i have to integrate into the society and so on. Eventually in the highschool i had enough. I changed my whole outfit, started to hang out with only foreign people, u know kinda gangs, i had permanently a ""rude facial expression"" and i disrespected all teachers who told me to be more ""integrated"" 
If i tryna tell them my life theyre like ""what, you try to tell me all this is happenin HERE, in GERMANY!? Please man, are u kiddin me?!"" people just dont want to believe it even if its totally clear. They say were responsible for our own situation. ""you immigrants cant adapt into the society"". Yeah we cant adapt cause they never accepted us. Just imagine: german statistics say if your name sounds foreign you have to write AT LEAST 3 times more applications to get only an interview. E.g. i know s.b. who studied architecture and finished the university with the best grade. Guess what: he searched for 6 months to get a job and he has only got invited to one interview and there they told him that he can work but he will get less salary.

 Its just disturbing, all this struggle to live a normal life. Because all of that the youth just doesnt want to speak anymore. They've enough of all the hatred and racism and so they end up in the streets. Me and my friends never had a real childhood: while other kids were playin hide and seek or things like that, we in our ""hood"" took our boxing gloves and went outside to fight. The kids become psycopats here cause all this shit is unbearable, especially for a child. its just sick! 
Though today im “normal” again, thanks to my religion, its really hard to keep the patience. Everyday I have to listen to silly jokes and have to watch the news blaming migrants. People might say “don’t take it that serious, these r just little things.” But in german we say “Steter Tropfen höhlt den Stein!” which hast he same meaning as the english phrase „Little strokes fell big oaks.“.
Don’t get me wrong! I neither blame the Germans nor the Turkish people. Both have to do something to solve this problem. But I can say about myself and many other people that we made much more steps towards the german society than they did. But I didn’t lose my hope cause I also see little positive developments everyday. U know: “slow motion better than no motion” ;)
I hope I could bring across my point of view and im always ready to discuss and talk about things like that. Im always open towards other opinions and I’d love to hear’em! sorry if I made mistakes. Yet, my English is not perfect ;) !!!

true,SchwarzerRhobar,null,null,"German here, I will give you my two cents.

Your wife most certainly is not a Nazi, but she simplifies the problem. Turkish people as the biggest immigrant group get a lot of flak, but the problem is, that Germany has failed to integrate them 30 years ago. Germany needed a lot of guest-workers and mainly Turkish people came. They did not need to speak German since only their cheap labour force was wanted.

If they worked in Germany they earned more money than in Turkey so some of them decided to stay. Because they were never required to really study German and the German culture they and their families never really learned ""to be"" German.

Not to mention it is fucking difficult to get an education if you don't speak a language properly. No education means demeaning low wage jobs, or even no jobs.

This leads to rage. Why the fuck should they try to get an education if it's harder for them and they'll get a low wage job anyway. This leads to crime to ""make a quick buck"" or simply to vent their rage which leads to generalization that most Turks are criminal scum, which leads to that employers don't like to hire Turks, and the circle begins anew

In my opinion some of the older generation of Turkish immigrants are partially to blame, because they did not try to  integrate themselves or their children properly. Also the German governement 30 years ago did ignore the problems, offering no assistance and not creating a need that they should learn German culture/language.

And it is the responsibility of each individual who commits a crime. They may have had it harder, hence much crime is commited by immigrants(Turks since they are the largest group), but it is like saying ""I don't like males because most of violent crimes are commited by them"".

If she already has those opinions, feeding her that article would only be counterproductive. I was going to add that the book was poison, but since OP already seems to have a critical attitude towards stereotypes I trust him to come to that conclusion by himself. :)

Regarding the Vietnamese outperforming everybody else, you make a good point -- their parent generation had been sent to the former East Germany by their government as part of a Socialist brotherhood thing, AFAIK. But there also seems to be a cultural component, Asian immigrants in general (yay, stereotypes) tend to be highly successful everywhere. If you look at statistics from the US, for example, you'll see a similar effect. They put a high value on education, and parents expect their children to perform academically. So, there is a lot of pressure on them to study, and that shows in the statistics.

What you say is pretty much supports what I meant -- children from parents who didn't receive a good education disproportionally tend to end up on Hauptschule (OP: see [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Germany), Germany has an outdated three-tiered secondary school system, where children get sent to one of three branches after primary school, depending on how they perform. This determines whether they will have access to higher education later in life, or generally which jobs they can learn. There is the possibility to switch later on, but it's difficult.) This is a problem in general, but children who didn't learn German at home are especially disadvantaged, because by the time they've picked up the language they're already fallen so far behind that they can't catch up by the time the recommendations are made. So, you end up with smart kids in a school that has a curriculum for less academically talented kids, which leads to boredom, which in turn leads to other problems in school and beyond, and so on. There are many vicious cycles here, but the school system is the main culprit, IMHO.  
Another effect this split early in life has is that society in Germany is separated by education. You just don't retain the friends you had for very long if you get sent to separate schools after fourth grade. So, social groups get split up and new groups form. From then on, you mostly make friends through other friends, then later at uni or vocational school, then through your job, and so on. Essentially, different cultures develop, and unless you join a sports club or the like, they don't mix. Even if you somehow meet somebody from a different educational background later in life, you've grown culturally so far apart that it's difficult to even find a topic to talk about (I'm just not into soccer, which seems to be the one universal topic).

An enlightened religious man is no bigot, an ignorant religious man is. This statement is also true if you remove the word 'religious' entirely.

The problem with Hitchens is that he so often draws on the past to explain why religion is a bad thing, however if we were to draw on other ideals they also show deep flaws under closer historical scrutiny. The past is a good way to draw context on an issue, however to treat horrific events coming from the 17th century as being relevant **today** proving why religion is a detrimental force to civilization **today** is folly.

Not to mention that religion is also something that rejects change (that is it's fundamental character isn't it, they know ALL the truth and so it can't be possibly changed) as opposed to scientific and cultural progress which is updated with every generation. Also it is fact that religion has been and sadly continues to be ubiquitous and has always had a deciding role in any horrific event relevant or irrelevant for you today.

true,blackstar9000,null,null,"Very well, then. Since you asked specifically about the question asked by Mega[n?], let's start with this, from Hitchens' reply:

&gt; there’s something about religion that is very often, at any rate, in its original monotheistic and Judaistic form, is ab initio an expression of exclusivism.

Judaism is certainly not the ""original form"" of religion, and there's little evidence to suggest that religion was originally monotheistic. If anything, earlier religious forms, like Greek polytheism, seem to have been widely inclusive. Hitchens is explicitly generalizing about religion by supposing that monotheism and Judaic exclusivism are indicative of the entire practice of religion.

&gt; If you tell me in the Balkans what your religion is, I can tell you what your nationality is.

Perhaps -- although, like SavannaJeff, I'm skeptical of Hitchens' assurance on that point -- but again, Hitchens is taking a specific and narrow example in order to make a general point about religion. What's true of religion in the Balkans may not be true of religion as a phenomenon. And if that's so (here, again, I refer you to the essays, which make this point better than I could here), then isn't it plausible that there's something about the politics of the Balkans that make its religious affiliations more poisonous than religious affiliations necessarily have to be?

&gt; Religion and in fact any form of faith, because it is a surrender of reason...

That's Hitchens' particular Rationalistic interpretation of faith, but it doesn't necessarily match all religious conceptions of faith. I've [discussed alternative understandings](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/gfi4c/we_thus_see_that_far_from_mocking_religion_as/c1n8hd8) elsewhere.

Further down:

&gt; it’s very touching for Tony to say that he recently went to a meeting that bridged a religious divide in Northern Ireland; where does the religious divide come from? 400 years and more, in my own country of birth, of people killing each others’ children, depending on what kind of Christian they were, and sending each others’ children in rhetoric to hell, and making Northern Ireland the place, the most remarkable in Northern Europe for unemployment, for ignorance, for poverty and for, I would say, stupidity too.

Notice he says almost nothing about the political forces that made religious affiliation a marker of nationalist loyalty in Northern Ireland. The use of ""Catholic/Papist"" and ""Protestant/Anglican"" as shorthand for one's loyalty to Irish nationalism or British protectionism, respectively, is an effect of the use of religious suppression as a tool of political oppression. It isn't, as Hitchens' response implies, that people in Northern Ireland one day decided that it would be a good idea to kill people if they weren't Catholic. Restricting religious difference in the region was a way of combating nationalist loyalties. But acknowledging that wouldn't play into Hitchens' position of presenting religion as though it were inherently divisive and given to atrocity.

Then there's this nigh incomprehensible gem:

&gt; Rwanda, do I say that there would be no quarrel between Hutu and Tutsi, people in Rwanda. Belgian colonialism made it worse, but there are no doubt innate ethnic differences … most Christian country in Africa. In fact, by one account — that’s to say, numbers of people in relation to numbers of churches, it’s the most Christian country in the world, and the Hutu power genocide at any rate was preached from the pulpits, actually the pulpit of the Catholic church, as many of the people we are looking for wanted in that genocide are hiding in the Vatican, along with a number of other people who should be given up to international justice, by the way, quite a number of people.

But that's covered, in part, in the essays I linked to, so I won't belabor it here. If you don't have time to read it now, maybe you'll download the collection and read them later.

* We have London (and also lots of other good places no one ever visits)

* Some of the best Universities in the world (but you have to pay for them)

Cons:

* The weather sucks 

* When you're in mainland Europe you usually get confused with people from the USA. 

* We're terrible at learning languages (seriously mainland Europe, if a british person is trying to talk in your native tongue go along with it, don't just straight to english, it makes it almost impossible to improve!

* Our drinking culture sucks, I was in brussels recently, beer in vending machines bars open till 4am, love it! 

* A lot of people are lazy our benefit system is very easily exploited,

* Generally people are skeptical of the EU

* We're constantly spending our money on wars

Cela n'enlève en rien à sa nature d'authentique trésor,  mais je crains que sans accompagnement et sans explications, un public *né après le World Wide Web* soit rapidement rebuté par un ouvrage qui peut sembler, de prime abord, comme exagérément figé et doctrinal.

Pro:

  * nice weather with four seasons, not too cold and not too hot

  * good food

  * great public train/bus system (at leas tin Vienna)

  * can take long holidays (2 weeks is no problem)

  * stable political system

  * we are neutral and do not go to war or send people to war ever

  * free and very good health care

  * good social system (you are not fucked if you loose your job)

  * a lot of great bear, and bars are open until morning

  * great country side

Negative:

  * a lot of people are racist, almost all parties are right leaning, ""left"" leaning parties are just whiners and won't really change anything

  * recently immigrated people have ghettos and do not integrate

  * high cost of living, food and restaurant can be more expensive than Tokyo

  * shitty opening times for shops, closed on sunday, open until 7pm/8pm at night (something i could not go back to)

  * very hight taxes

  * most people are unwilling to learn foreign languages

  * internationally we are completely super minor thanks to fucking up twice in the past

  * you rather not show any patriotic signs or you will be marked a NAZI

  * too low birth rate, too many old people and therefore nobody knows if you will ever get any pension from the country (but you still pay)

  * beaurocratic nightmare, we have more than most other countries, still a leftover from the old ""glory"" empire days.

for Japan (where I live know)

Pro:

  * shops open every day, shop whenever you want, 24h convenience stores, post office open 24x7

  * food, bento, etc prices can be low if you know where to go. average living cost is low

  * awesome countryside with beautiful areas

  * a lot of cultural things all around

  * great place to meet other foreigners who live here and enjoy it

  * very low tax system

  * food is more than amazing, and you can get almost all styles of food you would want

  * super fast and cheap internet

  * trains are on time, come often and go everywhere

Negative:

  * rent can be super high if you want to live in a convenient place

  * medical care is not very good

  * very crowded (no problem for me, but a lot of foreigners have problems with this)

  * public transit can be super expensive

  * if you do not speak/read japanese you will never ""live"" here and you will feel that japanese are racist

  * political system is a joke, they had more prime ministers than any other country in the same time

  * gender equality is still years and years behind any other first world country

  * very long working hours

  * too many old people and uncertain if you ever get any pension payment

* Lively music scene (not just Björk and Sigur Rós).
* Harmless wildlife, no poisonous bugs or snakes or other scary things (except for the occasional lost polar bear).

Cons:

* The weather.
* Most things are horribly expensive and the wages low compared to other Nordic nations.
* A world record in car ownership, city-planning is extremely car-oriented and public transportation poorly developed.
* Xenophobia is widespread and systematic, individuals are mostly nice and inviting to foreigners but it is hard for them to get fully accepted in what is essentially one big close-knit family.

There are some great free podcasts that you can get on iTunes to help you learn german. I would also check out [Leos German](http://dict.leo.org/) website. It functions as a great dictionary and can help you understand some more conjugations. Google Translate is also a life saver and I would use that if you have any difficult homework and want to get a rough idea about what a passage means. I am sure you know but **DO NOT USE IT AS A DIRECT TRANSLATION**. Lastly, [this conjugation website](http://conjugator.reverso.net/conjugation-english.html) is really handy and can be used for all verbs. If you are ever stumped I would turn to here. 

I was in a German class similar to yours and worked hard with about 5 other people. It may not seem like much now, but it will pay off in the long run. Keep working at it and visit Germany/Austria as soon as you can. I was fortunate enough to travel around Germany for a week and I knew a lot more German than I thought I did.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Hitchens does not state that Judaism is the original form of religion he states ""*the original form of monotheism **and** Judaism*"" which he clearly said so to specify and distinguish but also to stress where exclusivism is best represented and revealed. Judaism is certainly one of the oldest still active religions and plays a major role in Christianity and Islam, represented by more than half the world's population, not to mention monotheism as a whole, which is why he stresses on that. If I have to work with your example of the Greek polytheism I'd have to firmly disagree as it was only Greek citizen's (excluding slaves, women and foreigners) privilege. The Thracians, Tojans and other direct neighbors had their own patron Gods and mythology and the Greek exclusivism is clearly represented in the development of the later Roman polytheism. And please do not forget that it was exactly the Greeks who first used and developed Christianity in it's modern monotheistic form. Please don't give me that Jesus bullshit, let's be clear on that. Centuries after this personality existed or not, was the true substantive birth of the Religion and developed in even more centuries, and so on and so on.

The Balkans are in no way specific and narrow example! The Balkans (talking ancient Greeks, Byzantium as a birthplace of Christianity and its later conversion to Islam, the schism and the Modern (pre and post Nationalism) times, up to the very actual events in Kosovo) have played and still play a big role and the example is actually a very cosmic one, in fact showing Hitchen's global and detailed grasp on the subject. You can very much take the Balkans at any time in history and find ""the perfect"" example you may or may not be searching. This is in no way subjective but sure if you ask the average American or West European today the place is a total laughing matter (SavannaJeff's ignorance theory can be vividly applied here).

The surrender of reason quote is loaded with pathos and has a more populist aim, Hitchens is a skilled debater and orator, he possess the public, those techniques are maybe controversial from a more scientific philosophical point of view... but they are powerfully emotional and stick to one's mind.

Northern Ireland. I actually thought Blair wouldn't want to go there and be Hitch slapped but he actually had the balls. Of course political, ethnic and may I say geographical division comes before religion, but religion.. and I will quote Hitchens from the same debate here:

&gt; *Religion [is] a tremendous intensifier [...] of all things that are in fact divisive rather than inclusive and that’s why its history is so stained with blood, not just of crimes against humanity, womanhood, reason and science, attacks upon medicine and enlightenment, all these appalling things that Tony kept defending himself from and I didn’t even have time to bring up.*

Religion has always committed itself to this Uhrinstinkt of murder and oppression, and made it its tool for success, sacrificing anything in its path. One could argue that other factors like science have contributed to mankind's barbaric quest for annihilation but given what science has also contributed to our better understanding of ourselves and why we actually do this, it has also given us a path to solution to it and actually an exit sign to religion's thousands of years doom loop.

Pros:

* Government usually knows what they are doing.

Every now and then, they even seem to make decisions that are in the best interest of the people they represent.
* Infrastructure is great. Even though most people still complain, we have one of the best railway systems in the world. We have the largest airport in the world outside the US. We have the (second to?) largest sea harbor in the world. We supply half of Europe.
*  Freedom. The laws in this country are mostly set up with one thought in mind: As long as you don't harm anyone (including yourself), you can basically do what you want.
* Technology &amp; Economy. We have many high-tech companies like Philips, Shell, ASML, etc. We always seem to be one of the world leaders in many economic areas. Unemployment is low, average pay is high.

true,blackstar9000,null,null,"&gt; he states ""the original form of monotheism and Judaism""

It's telling that, in order to make your point, you have to change the language he actually used. Maybe he actually meant it the way you wrote it, but according to the transcription you linked to, what he said was, ""there’s something about religion that is very often, at any rate, in its original monotheistic and Judaistic form, is ab initio an expression of exclusivism."" The only noun that preceded the possessive pronoun ""its"" is ""religion, so ""its original and Judaistic form"" must refer back to religion. At the very least, the sentence he actually spoke refers to monotheism as the original form of religion.

&gt; If I have to work with your example of the Greek polytheism I'd have to firmly disagree as it was only Greek citizen's (excluding slaves, women and foreigners) privilege.

That's simply incorrect. Slaves were excluded from most of the rights of citizenship, but were allowed to participate in the state cult of Eleusis, the most important mystery cult in ancient Greece, and were downright central to the reversal of social roles characteristic of the Saturnalia.

&gt; ... the Greek exclusivism is clearly represented in the development of the later Roman polytheism.

How can Greek exclusivism be represented in *Roman* religion?

&gt; Please don't give me that Jesus bullshit, let's be clear on that.

I don't even know what you mean by that.

&gt; Centuries after this personality existed or not, was the true substantive birth of the Religion...

Ah, I see. The root of our disagreement is that you have a different and totally arbitrary notion of ""true religion."" That pretty much precludes any possibility of agreement.

&gt; The Balkans are in no way specific and narrow example!

It's definitely specific. Any time you specify a particular region, you're being specific. Narrow is, I suppose, arguable, but given that the entire Balkan Peninsula takes up less area than France, about 0.3% of the total land area of the world, and contains less than a single percent of the total population of the world, I'd say it qualifies as a narrow field of interest. Which isn't to dismiss the Balkans. Personally, I'm fascinated by the region. But there's certainly no reason to think it's especially representative of religion.

&gt; Any perfectly nice religious person would again accuse of generalization...

And they'd be right. If all religion offered was a ""thousands of years doom loop,"" then we wouldn't be here discussing this. Modern science has been around for about 300 years; if you want to include the efforts of the Greek natural philosophers, expand that to about 2,400 years. On the basis of the most recent evidence, religion has been around for at least 10,000 years, and yet, during that period, humanity actually spread across every continent but Antarctica. Far from being destroyed by it, humanity expanded out of the cradle of civilization during the period when it knew religion but no organized scientific enterprise.

But this is pointless. It's obvious that your admiration for Hitchens will prompt you to dismiss any argument I raise, no matter how well substantiated by fact. Neither one of us is likely to be convinced by the other, and all that's left is to put on a show debate for the others reading this, who, by this point, must be few and far between.",0,1307626645,null,0,false,0,c1yp2d3,t3_hukqv,t1_c1yp2d3,t1_c1yoks8,1427228149,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

The first that comes to mind is language. Having the same language enables trade, and social connections. This, in turn favors political integration.

Also, for political integration to work, you need to have a unified political structure across all countries. The lack of a common language affects the opportunities for politicians and voters to have influence, or to even understand what is being discussed.

Pros: 

* Secular state and rampant atheism. :)
* French comics. A lot of choice. 
* French movie theatres : more choice in Paris for foreign movies than in Chicago or New York. 
* The French take politics very seriously. 
* University is still very cheap compared to many Western countries. 
* Public Transportations work really well (except during Strikes). Postal services are good. 

Cons:

* We elected Nicolas Sarkozy, our very own George W. Bush. 
* The French are conceited and always want to follow new trends. They are always afraid to be outmoded.
* They change logos every year as if they cannot bear stability. 
* but they keep the same politicians for decades. 
* French politics is still quite sexist (18% of MPs are women). 
* French Libraries are smaller, less accessible or less open than, e.g., in the US. 
* Most Museums are not free.
* French are more depressed and neurotic than most other Europeans. They also ingest more sleeping pills.
* If you are a late bloomer and do not have good grades in school before you are 18, you are (usually) doomed.  
* Most cities are not really accessible to disabled people. 
* The French are not really musical. Go to Germany where every city has a good orchestra. ",0,1307633436,null,0,false,0,c1yppo5,t3_huvum,t1_c1yppo5,t1_c1yojfb,1427228468,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

As cold as the swiss are, it is funny to see that you can speak to them in french or german, and they are still cold to you, but not rude like the level of 'rudeness' i saw in belgium. And such a contrast to going to the Netherlands for example.  The dutch people are so goddamn nice when compared to the flemish---at least that was my impression.  You go to a dutch restaurant, as soon as they see that you look foreigner, they talk to you in english.  Not in Belgium.

And forget customer service in Belgium.  That concept does not exist there.

**Pros:** 

* Nature and wildlife. 24 hours daylight in summer :)
* Peaceful and stable democracy.
* Free healthcare.
* Free education, including University.
* Low unemployment - high wages.
* Good welfare system - Being sick/unemployed has almost no financial consequences. 
* 5 weeks paid vacation.
* Paid maternity and paternity leave (1 year, I believe). Having a child (or three) does not bankrupt you.
* Everyone speaks at least one foreign language. (Mostly English)
* Freedom of religion. Atheism seems to be the norm.
* Good Internet infrastructure.
* A solid economy.
* We are becoming less dependent on income from oil and gas. (The economy is more diverse now than before)
* Natural disasters are very rare. No earthquakes and volcanoes :)
* The political system is working.
* Most people respect the law, pay their taxes etc.
* Almost no corruption.
* A liberal population - gay marriage, gender equality, secularism etc.
* Clean (but at times very expensive) energy.
* We're good at everything ski-related :p


**Pro &amp; Con: High taxes, not a member of the EU.**

**Cons:**

* Climate. Short summer, long winter. N-Norway: Polar night. Frequent winter storms. Cold. Cold. Cold.
* Far, far away from the rest of Europe. (Especially the north)
* Norwegian cuisine.
* [Jante Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jante_Law)
* Cost of living is high.
* The welfare system is easily exploited. Too many people living on welfare.
* Naïve politicians.
* Huge inefficient public sector.
* Bureaucracy - takes ages to get anything done. There is a form for everything.
* Having to implement EU laws even if we're not a member/can't vote.
* State church
* High wages and exchange rate is bad for exports and tourism.
* Dental care is super expensive! 
* Crappy roads in Northern Norway.
* Railroads are in a bad shape. Almost no high speed rail. No railroads north of Bodø.
* Norwegian drinking ""culture"". Binge drinking. Weird laws regulating the sale of alcoholic beverages.
* Norwegians complain about everything.
* Norway's national football team is a joke.
* Customs barrier - We must pay toll on all items worth more than 200 NOK (€25), even when we order stuff from Europe. Where did the single european market go??
* Lack of diverse career opportunities (except for Oslo and some of the other ""major"" cities)
* Toll fees on (almost) all new roads - even if everything car-related is taxed beyond reason.
* Very difficult for young people to enter the housing market. Rent is ridiculously high even in small towns...",0,1307648877,null,0,true,0,c1yrjrm,t3_huvum,t1_c1yrjrm,t3_huvum,1427229332,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

3) what about the duty-free shops at the airport ?

Bonus hint : a good alternative to train for traveling from and to the airport are Air France busses (no need to fly Air France) and Roissybus: same price as train, direct route, non stop, pick you up and leaves you at your exact terminal.

Redditor marseillais here, I can list a few must see places, like:
* La calanque de Sugiton bus 21 to Luminy end of the line, then walk to Sugiton (don't forget to go to the Belvedere) then go dow to the sea and dive in the turquoise down the cliffs.
* Iles du Frioul, boat from Vieux Port, almost desert islands in the bay.
* Maybe take the 20mn bus ride to Aix en Provence, for a posher experience of south France.
* Cassis definitely, from Marseille by bus or train, once there, you can take the ""Route des Crètes"" you be on the top of (if I remember well) europe's highest sea cliff. On the end of this road, La Ciotat old town deserves the sight, so does the Calanque of Figuerolles and the Park of Mugel.

And for the nights, I think everything starts at the Cours Estienne d'Orves or at ""La Plaine"" to catch up with people. Don't expect a thrilling nightlife, but you can find some nice bars sometimes with music and a nice terrace. Avoid restaurants on Vieux Port just tourist traps, and remember there is no cheap Bouillabaisse.

Some may warn you about the dangers of the city. Marseille is a very socially mixed city, with a strong ethnic diversity. The most shocking for visitors is that contrary to places like Paris or London, the poor people, is not deported in the suburbs but lives downtown because the city is cheap. The result can be frightening and sometimes dangerous but I've been living here for almost 10 years without any problem. Of course, you'll keep your wallet in your front pocket, and valuable Items and important documents in your hotel room bla bla bla, you're the one abroad you know that...

It's a bit awkward, but this is a transcription of a talk, right?  I read him as saying that Judaism was originally founded on exclusivism and I don't think that's a very debatable point, is it?

Perhaps you could chide him for equating ""religion"" with ""the Abrahamic tradition"" or something like that (maybe even with ""Christianity"") but if he sees himself as addressing contemporary Europe/America then it's not that big a deal.
