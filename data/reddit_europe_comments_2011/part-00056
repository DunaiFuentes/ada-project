true,JrMint,null,null,"A lot of the things she says about France are true concerning how Maghrebian people I've met consider themselves not really French even though France is the only country they really know. That phenomenon happens in the US too with certain populations of Hispanics.

However, I don't agree with this characterization that she's a foreigner before anything else *in her own head*, to the point where her identity itself is consumed by it. It seems a little over the top.

If I lived in NYC, I'd probably ask someone where they're from if I met them and they had a strong accent or spoke imperfect English. It's not to ""other"" the person and distance myself, but to know about someone who clearly *isn't* from where I am, but chose to make their home there anyway. I think in France language is the main barrier to overcome. If you speak perfect French, you command respect like any other intelligent French person. If you speak broken French with a heavy accent, well, the stereotypical French reaction is to ""other"" you, because you remind them of others who speak with a ""strange"" accent and are thus from abroad, namely (North) Africans and there are certain prejudices in place in a lot of people's minds. It's unfair, but it happens. This is not, however, the case for ALL foreign accents. The Belgian accent is kind of funny and nice to hear, and Québécois is also interesting. They are foreign, but I don't think people with those accents in France are excluded. I think it's mainly about her accent and the fact that she also shares a skin color that could easily be considered Arab to French people (while at the same time ""white"" to African people, amazing), and that can't help her case.

Also, I think it's difficult to consider the situation because she clearly identifies as an expat and makes it a big deal in her life (public book readings in English in Paris, writing about France from the point of view of *an outsider looking in*, etc). How can she hope to have a different identity in France when she lets herself be defined by the outside world? But this is a bit of a chicken-egg discussion: did she become an expat because she's excluded, or is she excluded because she's an expat?

I think only cure for this is excellent command of the French language. All levels of French life -- as opposed to EXPAT life -- demand it, whether it's administration, education, or meeting people. This is ironic because the French are traditionally very bad at foreign languages themselves and have heavy accents.

I think we need to know if english speaking people are interested in the ligue1... I would love to discuss things in french, but if we want this subreddit to be a friendly place to our fellow redditors we have to keep the discussion in english.


So basically, i'm down with the [FR] tag, but maybe we should translate the titles in english... that way the english speaking redditors will be able to take part in any discussion...

&gt; Should we have match threads for the major games or a single thread for every match day ?

Good idea too, but for now on, we're not enough to talk about it... maybe talking about the sunday night game is a good start ?

&gt; Should we have links to match highlights ? To live streaming of games ?

Yes ! I think, Ribsduff has been doing a great job so far.

&gt; Any other site you would recommend, in particular :

http://www.footmercato.net

not sure, but I think http://www.omplanete.com is pretty active...

&gt; English-language Ligue 1 coverage ?

Yahoo.co.uk does a pretty good job I think :

Die Sache ist ja: Es ist extrem viel möglich heutzutage, wird aber leider nicht umgesetzt. Die Franzosen können heute Kraftwerke bauen die an Sicherheit kaum zu übertreffen sind.

Ich denke, es geht mehr um Kosten. Die einen Reaktoren (ja, aus dem Gedanken heraus später Bomben zu bauen) wurden ja schon vor 50 Jahren konzipiert und sind heute ausgereift. Das andere ist erst im Anfangsstadium und wie es aussieht gibts heute dafür ohnehin kaum noch Forschungsmittel. Wenn ich einen Reaktor bauen will, dann lasse ich mich nicht auf ein milliardenteurers Risiko ein. Nur damits am Ende evtl nicht klappt. Da geh ich auf Nummer sicher.

**Edit** I have a little time to complete my answer. I think a good thing to do would be to look for a sociologist work on these guys, that would be the best... however, I knew one of them (brother of a schoolmate) and have a blur idea of who they are. 

From what I know: young people, some have some money from the parents, some don’t; some beg money from passing people; if they are 25+, they may have the [RSA](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenu_de_solidarit%C3%A9_active) but I think it’s more and more difficult for them; some have a job. Some do seasonal works, like fruit picking. Usually very pacific, can even be helpful if you’re having trouble with some bad guys. 

The dogs are part of the identity, just as the funny hair (I don’t believe the basic cops would hesitate to send the dog to the pound). Some profess some kind of universal animal loving, some are even vegetalists. Note that usually they don’t have attack dogs, just small crossbreds. 

Most smoke cannabis and drink beer, some are on harder stuff. Many pretend to be anarchist, most of the time it’s just a way to state that they don’t like our society. Once in a bistro, I heard a old guy saying: ""yeah, if they were no young guys around who don’t like society... that would be sad..."" 

If you read french, here’s a blog from a punk cartoonist: http://blog.chabd.com/ it might give you more insight on this.

**Edit2** If you read french, [this sociologist work](http://sejed.revues.org/index6292.html) can interest you (lots on the relation with the dogs; interesting considerations/explanations on the reaction of the society towards these punks).

As you rightly said, our biggest problem are the small numbers but this subreddit is pretty good apart from that. I dont know if theres much we can do of the numbers as there arent that many French people on reddit and neutrals are less interested in Ligue  1 than say Laliga or Serie A. I think we should take advantage to post interesting stuff of French league on r/soccer, for example Ive seen that Eredevisie gets quite alot of posts each time theres a big game or a nice goal. Seeing how Lille dominated CSKA and how Rennes were able to dominate Udinese away from home (until they had to play with 10 men because of injury) showed me that even **I** underestimated Ligue 1.

Apart from this, I agree with Kgoule that its a good idea to post link titles in English but put an [fr] to indicate it is in French.

They, in my opinion, should have said something like ""there's no way to tell when an hearthquake will strike, we cannot rule out or in a strike etc."" This is the most science compliant claim because right now nodoby can predict when and where an hearthquake will happen.

They instead told people that an hearthquake won't happen relying on probabilistic reasoning (99,999% of my life is hearthquake free so it won't happen) not scientific reasoning worrying that the Abruzzese people could go nuts and do something stupid

They treated people as a bunch of peasant to manage and not rational people to reason with (I know we as a people are hard to deal with).

Of course I'm against the trial and the criminalization of the scientists because they weren't able to predict an hearthquake and even more against of the people that want ""justice"" putting them in jail (maybe those justice looking people should ask their Gods why it happened) ",0,1316614412,null,0,false,0,c2lhmtr,t3_klear,t1_c2lhmtr,t1_c2l7vgw,1427628095,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

The companies were being a bit cautious during the recession a couple of years ago by not hiring any new people and not giving any pay rises and overall the situation didn't change much. It's only recently that the unemployment rates rose a little bit. Overall I wouldn't say that much has changed for people, but prices and taxes have been rising (they are talking about changing the VAT to 17% from 15%).

Since Cyprus has very good relations with Greece, it is exposed a bit due to the debt crisis, causing it to be downgraded by the usual suspects. The thing that did the most to harm the economy was the explosion that took out the main power station causing about 2 billion euros of damage. Apparently the downgrades have made borrowing costs higher, and in order to avoid getting an EU bailout for 2012, they are currently talking to Russia for a 2.5 billion euro loan at 4.5% interest rates.

The good news all over the local news today is that the gas reserves found in Cyprus's EEZ are theoretically worth around about $7 trillion or so and should be a very good thing for the eurozone economy in general (but since Cyprus is such a small economy, this will easily boost the economy BIG time when they get they whole thing going -- drilling started a few days ago).

As for the media.. yes.. they are blowing everything out of proportion -- sure.. the problem with the debt is very real, but overall when you add the eurozone together and compare it with the US's debt problem.. theirs is worse. The only reason they can claim otherwise is that we don't have a fiscal union. I suspect shit will continue to look ""really bad for euro and the eurozone"".. then eventually they will all get together and make an announcement, and then a few weeks later the dollar completely tanks -- and that's when they realize that their government has been bankrupt for a while now -- it'll be like an onion article, but for real :P",0,1316631961,null,0,true,0,c2lk20k,t3_kmshk,t1_c2lk20k,t3_kmshk,1427629237,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

&gt; The SF and the Einheitsliste, which present themselves as the “left,” were able to take votes from the Social Democrats because of voter discontent with the destruction of the welfare state. 

You'd be interested in knowing that the public sector has never been larger than it is today, and that public consumption grew with an average of almost 2 % over the last ten years.

&gt; Many workers no longer trust the Social Democrats, believing quite correctly that they will not defend the social gains for which generations of workers fought.

&gt; Now, he will delegate this task to the Social Democrats, who will be in a better position to use the trade unions to suppress working class opposition.

&gt; They share the view that the working class must bear the costs of the financial crisis and the bank bailouts. 

&gt; This aggressive foreign policy was designed, in part, to distract people from domestic problems and help weld together the internally fractious ruling coalition.

All of the above are extremely subjective. And a few factual checks:

&gt; Concern over the social cuts was the main reason for the high voter turnout of 87.7 percent in last week’s election.

This statement is completely without any evidence.

&gt; Between the two, there are no significant differences in policy concerning Europe, the economy and defence.

The difference between their economic policies is rather large, and currently causing major headaches with the PM-elect as she tries to form a government.

&gt; The Einheitsliste promises its support but declines to formally join the coalition.

Noone wants them in the coalition anyway, and it's not like Enhedslisten is going to topple a red government.

Another focus is certainly the youth who just got out of university and can't find a job suitable to their qualifications anywhere.

You can see a lot of houses on sale, and staying for sale for years. The whole housing market took a hit. The IVA is now at 23%, might go to 25% in the near future. Social security payments got pricier. General cuts here and there on perks, which I find more than welcome.

Portuguese can be quite resilient. You don't see manifestations or violence in the streets. People are unhappy with the situation, but more so with the political class, which is quite unfit and brought us to the point we are today.
In general terms, I'd say that everything is going fine, if you look only at the surface.

I guess our biggest problem lies with Greece. We were in bad shape, but nothing close to the Greek situation. The worsening of Greece economics is making our loans interest unbearable. The downgrade of our rating by S&amp;P was a punch to the stomach, and most people found it quite unfair, given our path correction. In a blink of an eye we lost tons of money with that single decision, and we were sent into the arms of the FMI. The FMI learned something from their previous action on Greece, and went a lot softer with us. Must of their decisions were accepted as needed interventions.

As for myself, I can't really complain. I'm a webdesigner and I have more work than what I can handle, and I'm actually considering in employing someone to help me.

The austerity measures included, slashing state spending by 24 billion kroner (€3.21 billion) over the coming three years. Rasmussen’s government seeks serious reductions to welfare and social spending. Unemployment benefit will be reduced, with claimants only able to collect the benefit for a maximum of two years instead of the previous four years. The children’s allowance paid to parents will be reduced by 5 percent across the board, while funding will also be removed for couples seeking IVF treatment in order to have children. 

As well as direct cuts to public spending, the government has initiated a tax reform that will reduce a number of public subsidies. Commuters who have lengthy journeys to work will see a reduction of almost 1 billion kroner (€134 million) in available subsidies between 2012 and 2019.

The squeeze on government spending will hit councils, with pressure growing for budget cuts. An agreement was reached between local authorities and the government to cut welfare costs in next year’s budget, along with other services. Budgets for local authorities in 2011 will be frozen at this year’s level, a move which translates to 1.1 billion kroner (€147 million) in cuts. Among the measures being considered to achieve savings is the privatisation of residential roads by local authorities, a move that would pass on the responsibility for their maintenance to local residents. Some 8,000 local authority jobs are expected to be lost.

true,OneSalientOversight,AUST,Australia,"Australian here. Yes I know we're not in Europe even though some people think we are located near Germany.

I keep an eye on European economic stats to ensure that I don't get caught up in all the ""OMG THE EUROZONE WILL SPLIT"" vibe that is promoted by both right and left commentators in the English speaking world.

My view is that Europe, as a whole, is in a better shape than the US. It's still bad in Europe, but there are a number of really important things that people (esp English speaking pundits) seem to ignore.

As regards to Budget deficits and Government debt, the EU and Eurozone have smaller budget deficits than the US (about -4% of GDP compared to around -8% of GDP in the US) and a **smaller** amount of government debt. This may confuse people so let me explain:

Certain countries in Europe (eg Greece) have huge levels of government debt while other countries do not. One of the problems with comparing Europe to the US is that both areas have different ways of comparing debt. When we hear that the US government has debt of 65% of GDP, that does not include debt accrued by state and local governments. In Europe, however, the debt figures that are reported DO include this debt. When you add US state and local government debt to the federal figure, it ends up being equal to if not more than that of Europe. [I blog about this here](http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2010/05/busting-myth-of-european-debt.html)

Another important fiscal statistic is tax revenue. Although some countries in the EU are famous for their inability to collect tax, overall EU/Eurozone governments have maintained a reasonable revenue base throughout the recent crisis. By contrast US tax revenue has plummeted. This means that the US needs to grow more and grow faster just in order to maintain its public spending than the EU/Eurozone will. Again I blog about it [here](http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2011/08/us-government-needs-more-revenue.html).

And finally we shouldn't forget Germany. Germany really is the engine of European growth and its economy has performed stunningly well throughout the crisis. Germany's growth is linked to the EU/Eurozone as a whole. So when we weep and wail over places like Greece and Ireland, just remember that these countries need a strong and resilient Germany demanding their goods and services in order to recover.

And finally look at politics in the EU. No politics is ever ""good"", but apart from the radical fringe groups there is no popular political party in any country that is anything near the radicalism of the US Tea Party and Republican party generally. There's no one in Europe yelling ""Communist"" at those who support universal health care or generous welfare spending or public education.

Long term, Europe has it made. The US, by contrast, is in very bad shape.",0,1316661166,null,0,false,0,c2lo79j,t3_kmshk,t1_c2lo79j,t3_kmshk,1427631260,23,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,23

But more importantly, this crisis reveals a number of fundamental flaws in the whole European construct, i.e. forming a currency union without having a fiscal union or common economic policies. A currency union also comes with a single (ECB) interest rate policy, despite the fact that economic development differs hugely between the North and the South. That's what's tearing the union apart right now, so the issue is much bigger than the budget deficit of one relatively small country. The value of a currency is very much dependent on market trust.

This argument about the optimal currency area is so commonly repeated, yet so wrong. Every single currency area is a compromise, no matter how small an area it covers. Do you think the economies of Northern and Southern Italy are really so integrated with each other that one single interest rate is perfect for both parts? How about Western and Eastern Germany? Eastern Germany should get its own currency and devalue it like hell to rescue its stagnant economy, right? And what about vibrant cities and large stagnant rural areas? They could all use different interest rates, right?

The thing is, the Euro was established despite the fact that it wasn't a perfectly optimal currency area; it was only sufficiently optimal, you could say. It was a deliberate attempt to integrate the economies further and gain from easier trade facilitated by the common currency. And in turn, those economies that refused to modernise, like Greece, would be forced to develop or face the consequences. It was a forced development strategy. And some didn't, so here we are.

You have to explain how Greece's lack of foresight and bad economy has anything to do with the Euro. All the Euro did was show just how bad things are.

You could also see if your university in Canada has some kind of exchange programme to let you do stuff at a French Uni, that would help as well make the transition smoother. The step from Uni to working life is often abrupt, so having a change of country there will be fine. 

About Law School: yes, that takes 5 years to do it properly &amp; you need a Bac (secondary school) to get in. You get no reduction for having studied something, because you have no basis in law what-so-ever.

Lyon has a ""hyper center"" (presqu'île) and generally speaking it's better to be somewhat close to it. Imagine a circle comprising La Croix Rousse in the north, out to the Part Dieu train station in the east, down to the Perrache train station in the south (and beyond with La Confluence), up to Fourvière in the west then back to La Croix Rousse.

But that's just a general guideline. There are nice neighborhoods further east (Monplaisir), the western suburbs tend to be *very* nice neighborhoods (le ""banlieue chic"") and even the historically troubled eastern suburbs have made great efforts and are now attracting a more middle-class population. Furthermore, certain central neighborhoods can be, *comment dire*, not so easy to live in. For example the ""basse pentes"" of the Croix Rousse and the riverside areas of Vieux Lyon have enormous problems with the numerous clubs that are there (late-night noise, fights, drunks, drugs).

&gt;Job market

Probably as good as or better than other big cities in France **but be forewarned**: getting legal work as a foreigner is extremely--extemely--difficult, i.e., to get a work visa you have to have a job offer and to have a job offer you have to have a work visa. Furthermore, your hypothetical employer has to prove that you have skills that cannot be found in the French population and be willing to wait at least three months (and that's optimistic) for the administrative process to do its thing. Get married or ""Pacsed"" with a French person (and even then...), have a job offer *before* you come, or be prepared to start your own business (also administratively heavy) or just be rich enough to live here without working (which, by the way, you would have to prove to have the right to do that).

&gt;Living conditions

Lyon is a big city that has managed to stay agreeable as a place to live. The city is often accused of being ""bourgeoise"", that is, somewhat closed off to others and a bit 'sleepy' with a somewhat limited nightlife compared to Paris or Marseille. But this somewhat slower pace is what makes Lyon more breathable too. Lyon is historically an industrial city (I often compare it to Chicago, (although it's nowhere near the size; Lyon *intra-muros* is a little less than 500,000 people)), which is how it got its reputation as a city of rich industrials living amongst themselves in the ""hôtels particuliers"" of the 6th arrondissement. But these days, that's no longer really true; Lyon resembles the other large cities of France, with a population ranging from very poor to very rich, which is visible in the streets.

Lyon has the reputation of being the gastronomic capital of France, but that gastronomy there is very expensive. But the ""normal"" restaurants are numerous and can be quite good. Nightlife is available, but as I mentioned above it is less dense than in Paris or Marseille and somewhat sequestered to certain neighborhoods. Daylife is quite good, with numerous cafés, bars, restaurants, parks, riversides, shops, etc. etc. Cultural life is good, with a fine orchestra, numerous theaters and many organized cultural events, such as the Biennial of Contemporary Arts, the ""Nuits Sonores"" festival, or the annual ""Nuits de Fourvière"".

How can one be riled by the illogical repetitive regurgitation of an unfounded accusation. To put it simply (which clearly needs to be done), when you can back up the point your trying to make (which is becoming more and more unclear as this debate continues, considering you can't decide if its subjectivity the WSWS are guilty of or ""USSR propaganda"") then I might find something to be riled about. In fact you are not even demonstrating any capability of discussing 'the justification of these measures' but merely playing a game of empty verbal jousting, another habit drunks are guilty of.

When you have 18 points your drivers license will be revoked and you can't get it back no matter what you do. Statue of limitations for these points is 2-10 years, depending on what you did. 

These are only the actualy penalties as described in our traffic law. If you endanger others you will probably be charged with other criminal laws.
Also these values are without any legal fees, so you are likely to spend more.

* Passing on the right: 100€ /  3 points (it's a really serious violation)
* Passing in a restricted area: 70€ / 1 point
* Passing without considerably higher speed: 80€ / 1 point
* Passing while you it's unclear if you will be obstructing oncoming traffic (at a turn where you can't see the whole road for example): 100€ / 3 points
* Same as above with endangering other cars: 200€ / 4 points / 1 month revoked license





**Speeding:**
* upto 10 km/h  10,- EUR 

* 11-15 km/h  20,- EUR 

* 16-20 km/h  30,- EUR 

* 21-25 km/h  70,- EUR, 1 points 

* 26-30 km/h 80,- EUR, 3 points

* 31-40 km/h 120,- EUR, 3 points 

* 41-50 km/h 160,- EUR, 3 points, 1 month revoked license

* 51-60 km/h 240,- EUR, 4 points, 1 month revoked license

* 61-70 km/h 440,- EUR, 4 points, 2 month revoked license

* über 70 km/h 600,- EUR, 4 points, 3 month revoked license





And if you get 2 speeding violations of over 25km/h you get your license revoked and have to get a new one (much harder and more expensive procedure than getting one in the usa).

* If you don't have a proper safety distance (speed/2 im m is considered enough) while driving over 80km/h you get points depending on how close you were driving. 

* Driving over a red light immediately (&lt;1s) after it changes to red: 90€ /  points
* Driving over a red light more than 1s after it changed to red: 200€ / 4 points / 1 month revoked license




**Drunk driving:**
* 0,03%-0,05% Nothing happens unless you cause an accident. If you cause an accident 7 points / license revoked + huge legal trouble.

* 0,05%-0,1% 500€ / 4 points / 1 month revoked license

* If that's not your first time: 1500€ / 4 points / 3 month revoked license

* over 0.1% Jail / 7points / up to 5 years revoked license






**Misc stuff you get in trouble for:**


* Using mobile phone while driving: 40€ / 1 point

* Not using winter tires when there's ice or snow outside: 40€ / 1point

* Cutting somebody off: 50€ / 3 points

* Hit &amp; Run: 7 points

* Reckless driving: 7 points (that can actually happen if you drive on the left lane the whole time)

* Driving without a driver's license: 6 points

It does tax the rich people more, because rich people buy more stuff. And they can, because they have loads of money.

This brings it all back to one issue: Do rich people deserve their money? I think most do. And of course taxes hurt rich people less than poor people. But the rich people have earned it, they shouldn't be punished for having a lot of money, because in that case the value of money would be lost.

Ireland also. I am quite possibly stating the obvious, but I think different industries have been hit to different degrees. Cleary the construction sector has been decimated, and a large number of related industries have been taken out with it. Civil engineering friends mostly lost their jobs in the last few years, but in the last few months they are getting back on track.

At the same time my industry (tech) is doing ok. Plenty of tech companies are still hiring and salaries don't seem to be going down. From what I've seen there are more open positions that qualified candidates (I recently took a new job, so did my girlfriend who is also tech).

The other area I have some knowledge on is health (brother and cousin are recently qualified doctors). LazarisIRL is right, the quality of health care is going down drastically, and all signs point to a continuation in that slide. The major problem is the quality of life afforded to young Doctors here. The salary debate is a red herring, they aren't paid overwhelming salaries but they are working crazy hours. The quality of life difference for the Docs who have already left is quite astonishing.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Because it's a discussion? I think comparing it to other systems is very relevant.

Not if the other system is totally out of scope.  It's just too often that you see ""oh yeah, well the US is worse!""  Well, of fucking course it is.  That's why I live in a civilized country.

&gt; It does tax the rich people more, because rich people buy more stuff. 

See, it doesn't work like this, though.  Let's go over the basics:  rent, clothing, food, then a bit higher up transportation and communication.  You have to purchase these in order to function economically in modern society.  There is no way around it.  

Now, my partner and I are what you would probably call ""high income professionals"" or some such - we do not consider ourselves rich, but we do pretty well.  There is only a certain amount of stuff we need to buy every month.  Anything above that is disposable income.  We can buy everything that we need, plus some nice things for fun, but we do not run around buying yachts and cars and Rolexes, because that would be stupid and pointless.  Now extrapolate that to someone bringing in 500k (I like round numbers) - he is not buying proportionately more stuff, and thus paying proportionately more VAT.

But the person earning a low income often can't even afford to get the basic versions of those necessities, let alone buy ""fun"" stuff, and yet they are paying VAT on all the things they need.  

It is irrelevant whether rich people ""deserve"" their money or not.  Taxes are not punishment, and the moment I start hearing people talk about ""well, you shouldn't have that much money anyway"" I start to rage.  It's ignorant and pointless, and I think we agree on that.  But taxes are a way to pay for stuff - either roads and schools and hospitals, or to avoid having the entire economic system blow up and fuck us all to hell, like it appears to be in the process of doing right now.  And a high-income / wealthy person benefited more from all those things (and from an un-fucked economic system), and should thus contribute more, while someone who's not yet even ""middle class"" should not be hit disproportionately just in the interest of having your tax progression start early.  IMHO people under 30k/yr shouldn't even be paying income tax.

I'm aware of the Dutch system (I worked in Amsterdam for two years).  It is better.  However, although the numbers are different, the problem is exactly the same.  While it is easier on low income earners, it starts to fuck anyone aspiring to higher salaries.  You earn 64k?  More than half of that's gone, poof.  You're paying ~25% overall rate, and I assure you that those 16k are much more of a cost to you than the ~245k someone earning half a million pays.

Again, it's not a question of ""hurting"" rich people.  I'm employed by a Swiss company, and am really lucky with my taxes, really lucky that I have a job in a country that has a strong and functioning (fingers crossed) economy, and really lucky and grateful that I am doing pretty well.  But when an economy is in the toilet and in danger of really really bad things happening, then you'd better make sure that (a) you're only inflicting the hurt that's necessary, and (b) you're spreading the hurt in a way that can reasonably be tolerated by those you're hurting.

_Edit:_ when I worked in Holland, I had a 30% tax rebate for skilled foreigners.  So while that was welcome, most of your ""skilled foreigners"" are going to be fairly well paid, better than I was.

This sentence summarizes pretty well what seems to be the German public opinion lately. Most Germans I know are convinced that the EU is bad for Germany and that they are the only one supporting it financially, that they are the one who lose money here.

It's not the opinion in France. Of course, everybody recognize the important role of Germany, but the public in general (except the far-right) seem to still see the EU as a common construction, and most still believe in it. Which is why the French are presented as trying to lead (maybe too much for the German taste) in this article.

&gt;Centrist politician François Bayrou […] has even declared a ""state of emergency"" for 2012.
&gt;Bayrou is calling for an ""Agenda 2020""

Yes, well, it's not really significant. He's just a politician who stands no chance for the 2012 election and tries to pull out some marketing slogan that sound like a plan. The statistics are here to be discussed on the state of France, but please don't take internal politics out of their context. As in every country, you'll always find a random guy to say what you want to hear. It doesn't mean it's significant.

&gt;France stands more strongly for solidarity, while Germany stands for austerity

That's the feeling here, conveyed by the medias. Also, the opposition (socialist, left-wing, most likely opponent to Sarkozy for 2012) is in a debate period now in preparation of the election, and their position is that austerity doesn't work because it slows down growth. They say that you have to find a balance between economies and growth stimulation. So quite some people here don't support full austerity.

&gt;The smaller EU member states, however, are putting up ever more determined resistance to this idea of a German-French directorate.

That's legitimate, but difficult to do, especially with lots of parties around the EU against losing more national sovereignty.

Wow, the Spiegel supports Cohn-Bendit? Why not after all; but that surprised me after their whole criticism of the EU.

For everyone who's not familiar with him, he got into politics by being one of the leaders of the may 1968 ""revolution"" in France. He got into Germany (and took the nationality) and back to France. He's a EU parliament member, and is very pro-EU. His party is called ""Europe-Ecology"". People kinda like him here.

Also, there are other factors playing here. If you put a massive tax on the highest income, there won't be any point of trying to get rich, if the government is gonna take most of it. And money is supposed to be an incentive for people to do well in society. You also encourage rich people to leave the country, and the most well-paid executives will take a job abroad because of the better pay.

I would really recommend reading up on the history of the country.  Depending on which aspects you find most interesting (WWII, DDR-era, reunification), tailor your trip around that.  Maybe you find that you're fascinated with the prefab style public housing of the DDR-era.  Or maybe you've got a thing for Goethe (he's inescapable).  Perhaps you're interested in how the cities that suffered bombing damage from the Allies have rebuilt themselves.

Going there just to go there and hit the requisite tourist stops may lead to a less fulfilling experience, especially if you're alone.  Yeah, you'll party, but couldn't you do that anywhere?  It's good to have an agenda or a subject of interest.  Any Germans you meet will probably be happy to speak to you about a specific subject of their history, but not so much about the typical tourist stuff.

Hostels are good if you want to meet fellow travelers from around the world (and party).  Couch surfing is a great option if you want to really have a local tell you about the area and point you towards some cool things.

Studies have shown that people with a foreign name (especially turkish ones, for example) are invited less often to job interviews that those with german names, even if the rest of the application is identical - so clearly there's discrimination at work, conscious or not.

There are *some* cases why it could be useful for the employer to have a photograph, for example when the applicant will work with customers and should have an ""attractive"" appearance. Not saying that's ok, but it's one case where you at least could comprehend why knowing the looks of the applicant might be useful.

But I seriously doubt that these things are asked for because of a conscious attempt at discrimination; for some reasons they've been included in application and CVs for ages and that's how it's been done. Some employers don't require a photograph, but as it's normal to include one your application might be denied because they will think you ""got something to hide"". It clearly depends on the employer.

I've read an article about a case in austria where an applicant was denied because of the wrong zodiac sign and I've seen statistics somewhere that up to 10% of german employers considered your zodiac sign when looking at applicants, so there're clearly even weirder discriminations that ""just"" because of your age or the way you look.",0,1316736358,null,0,false,0,c2lw4k3,t3_ko5gb,t1_c2lw4k3,t3_ko5gb,1427635067,6,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,6

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; How does a rich person benefit more from roads and hospitals than a poor person? They're there for both to use.

Because the rich person has used that same infrastructure to make, say, 100k, while the poor person has used it to make 10k.  The benefit is disproportional, hence the reimbursement (if necessary) should be in accordance with the benefit.

Again, nobody is claiming that tax should be a punishment.  It's there to pay (a) to make sure you get good stuff and (b) to make sure you don't get bad stuff.  It's just a question of how the cost of that is allotted.

&gt; If you put a massive tax on the highest income

Nobody's talking about ""massive"" tax, although your definition of that may vary.  I'm saying that almost every country's tax progression is unfairly skewed toward low income earners and should be moved to the right.  

&gt; there won't be any point of trying to get rich,

By this logic, there is not any point to trying to get ""middle class"" either.  In your Dutch model, for example, the moment you hit 55k half of anything extra you earn goes away.  The marginal benefit to you of making another, say, 5k in income is _much_ lower than the marginal benefit of your rich counterpart making another 50k.

&gt; and I don't really mind the supposedly high VAT (19.5%)

While your arguments about economy and recycling are appreciated, they are also a totally different topic.  VAT is not a punitive tax on consumption in general, and consumption of environmentally poor goods in specific, the way cigarette or some gasoline taxes are.  It's simply a cheap, (too) easy way for governments to raise revenue, since people will also have to buy certain things.

However, it is also a destructive tax insofar as it impacts consumption.  That means less stuff is bought and sold, which means fewer jobs, fewer production, yada yada yada.

Well, except not having a high speed train the system isn't that fucked up. (Again compared to Germany.) Depending where you live the train system (train frequency) is even better. The trains aren't pretty but I have seen worse in western europe.

&gt; 60% of people in .pl can actually use the internet

But it's getting better. In the last 3 years I've been living in .pl the internet accessibility got a lot better. I started with only 10mbit, now I have 120 mbit. Even my grandma can get internet (she's living in a 20 people village with a telephone cable going 2km through the forrest).

&gt; American heavily online society

I don't know what's so heavy online about the US. I guess the average american has no idea what reddit is. (As the average pole has no idea what blip.pl is.) And personally I don't have a desire for a twitter feed scrolling through the news show.

&gt; Australian mostly atheist society?

I'm an atheist and I pretty much give a fuck about church/religion. Haven't been once in church here and don't let the priest bless my home (srsly fucked up tradition). And do you know what: No one cares about that. (Well besides my aunt who thinks the west has tainted me ...) Let the hardcore catholics do their shit if they like - as long as no one harasses you because you are ""godless"" what do you mind?

&gt; I don't want to deal with religious, pre-information era people my whole life. It's incredibly tiring.

Don't deal with them then? Ok, I guess it can get really tiring if you are that kind of crusading zealot atheist starting debates about religion on every occasion. Just stop giving a fuck about people's superstitions.

Many Poles I know are victims of the ""greener pastures"" syndrome. Just try it out: Move away for a few years and you will see that Poland isn't the hell hole you think it is. There are backwards idiots pretty much in every country.

Also a big plus for poland: I DO NOT HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE HOW TO PRONOUNCE MY NAME. God, I hate that.

Also keep in mind that Spain is in a difficult economic situation at the moment and it's not a easy as it used to be to find customers. I have friends that had to go from self-employed to fulltime jobs because of this.

* On average, how much do PHP developers in Spain charge per hour or per month?

I don't know about freelancers, but PHP fulltime positions pay between 25k and 35k EUR typically.

* Do you typically work from a coffeehouse or your homes, on average?

I prefer to work from a rented desk, i.e. in an office with others freelancers or sitting in with a company that has free space.

* How many hours do you typically work a week?

More than on a 9 to 5 job.

* Do you work internationally with foreign customers?

Both. You will have problems finding local customers if you don't speak Spanish, unless you are well connected to an expat network and in one of the big cities.

* What are some of the kinds of business expenses you typically have to pay for every year, such as web hosting, a lawyer, an accountant, online software, etc.

You shouldn't need a lawyer. Accounting firms charge around 50 EUR per month for freelancers.

* What are some of the problems that you face as freelancers? For instance, high taxation, intrusive government, trouble getting foreign customers, etc.

Spain has fantastic tax rates for freelancers. Sometimes you run into reputation issues (people tend to think Spanish are lazy) but it's never really been a problem.

* Does the government give you any benefits while you are self-employed, such as low-cost healthcare, entrepreneur loans, grants and matching grants, etc.?

You get free health care at medical centers and hospitals in Spain but I recommend to put an extra 30 EUR in monthly and get private health insurance.

What to a Dutch student seems like corruption is a very complicated social-networking system of how people live in South Europe since many centuries. This being said the *actual* corruption that developed during the ""wild period"" that ensured after the collapse of the old system **is** Bulgaria's biggest problem and in fact the country's EU accession has been the major benefactor for the fight against it. Bulgaria has had huge improvements and brings stability and hope to the whole region. Not only did the country **deserve** the 2007 membership, it has since proven, statistically, that it was very much a right thing. Since 2007 there has only been one change of government - I simply DO NOT UNDERSTAND how you expect such huge and hard changes to happen in such short periods, and more over how you fail to see the positive improvement since the accession.

Romanians and Bulgarians are already free to travel in Europe and this will have no effect on those people from Romania/Bulgaria stealing or doing illegal things in the EU.
