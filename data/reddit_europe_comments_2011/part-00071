Fiscal union would precipitate consolidation of power to the central government, most notably in the European Parliament, European Commission, European Council, and Council of Ministers. The EU today functions very much like a confederacy. You could draw comparisons and contrasts between the current EU and the United States under the Articles of Confederation, and what a proposed federal Europe would look like in comparison to a strong federal state, such as Germany, Russia, or the United States. The debate over federal Europe goes way back, getting its real start around the formation of the European Coal and Steel Community in the early postwar period.

I don't know what this has to do with Merkel being ineffective, but then again, I don't really know who he is.

Let's not forget that Merkel is the woman who was able to shut up the FDP leading up to the Bundestag's vote on expanding the EFSF, bringing her then tenuous grip on power back from the brink. She has helped construct a deal that would see a dramatic cut in Greece's debt. Saying she is meek and ineffective is, as nomowolf said, delusional. Merkel is not a perfect leader; no one is.

The guy is 75, studied law. Started his career with projects of residential buildings. As a side thing he started a small cable television company to service the buildings. It is successful and only in ten years his media group is worth some 50€m. No one knows where he got the financing. In another 10 years dude owns a TV empire. His company today owns half of the television sector, the leading advertising agency, and also has huge stakes at the biggest publishing house. His brother and ex-wife partially own popular conservative-wing newspapers. He co-founded one of Italy's biggest banking and insurance groups. He owns his home town football club AC Milan. Richest Italian, worth about 10€b.

Starts his own party in 94' and enters politics. Soon thereafter, a massive campaign is launched and his party wins the elections, becomes Prime Minister of Italy. Fails to make a stable coalition and his cabinet falls after some months. Wins elections for the second time in 2001. PM again. Dude is accused on virtually any allegations all the time but doesn't give a single fuck. A couple of trials, still no fucks given. Passes laws to accommodate him against trials and more laws to help him with being a businessman and a PM. Coalition collapses again, Berlusconi resigns but forms a new government in 2 days as President. Loses general election in 2006, has a reorganized new party within the next year. In 2008 he smokes his arch nemesis Prodi out with a no-confidence vote, wins election, 3rd time PM. Shitstorm of allegations, becomes something like the clown of world politics. Some Italians are naturally manga-level enraged, at a rally someone brakes his face with a cathedral. The power struggle in Italy is even more intensified by the global financial meltdown, Berlusconi survives 3 or 5 or ""who's counting"" no-confidence votes. His coalition party is shaking and seems to be holding together by a magic string of ""if we do this we sink the economy and possibly the Eurozone"".

I would really suggest you choosing between the major large metropolitan areas:

1. London, Paris, Berlin (~~Europe~~World's best capitals)
2. Ruhr, Barcelona, Milan (Europe's greatest non-capitals)
3. Istanbul, Moscow, Warsaw (the wild wild east has much more to offer than most expect)

Out of group 1 I would suggest Berlin. Fucking amazing! Culture, full of life and potential, youth, history and night life like nowhere else and so on. The last standing city that has it all and is still cheaper.

Out of group 2 I would suggest Ruhr. From Amsterdam to Cologne, for me personally, that is the face of contemporary Europe. I love the people in the Ruhr.. the only warm hearted Germans you'll ever find. It's my favourite place I've been to in Europe. Lots of potential!

Out of group 3 I would suggest Istanbul. Very beautiful, romantic and different city, a portal between a lot of very very different worlds. It's got this something special about it, this kind of ""click"" that everybody should experience for themselves. Once you learn how to communicate with the people you're going to instantly fall in love with the city.

true,johnarnaud,null,null,"Hi there, well I'm from just south of Pau so here's my two cents - first piece of advice; Pau is in the Béarn, not the Basque Country! The Basque are very particular about their identity - being from abroad I doubt anybody will take you up on it but as they say; now you know and knowing is half the battle! 

Anyway couple of pointers, first the food. Try Jurançon white wine with fois gras - it's generally really expensive anywhere other than round there, so long as you don't have any moral objections (it's rather cruel to the goose) it's the tastiest dish on earth - try and get it with toasted brioche and jellied Armagnac. Other than that Confit de Canard is divine, and try the paté with Piment D'Espelette (it's a sweet chilli grown locally).

Now for fun the south-west is basically the only part of france that plays rugby, even small villages can generally muster a team and like all rugby matches the third half down the bistro is a laugh and a half, just be warned that they drink a lot (think Scottish amounts...). For something a bit more exotic try going to Mauleon for the [Cesta Punta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jai_alai) championship - now that is in the Basque country! Other than if you like hiking you'll be spoilt for choice La Valee D'Ossau (my valley!) is in a national park so is protected by the French state and home to some absolutely breathtaking views, although in all honesty not as grandiose as those offered by the alps. Now considering that you're going in winter go skiing (or snowboarding) for a weekend. You'll find it's a lot cheaper than the Alps but by necessity smaller (La Mongie is good as well as Gourette) and the weather more temperamental, although by living there you'll know when's best to go. When the weather clears up 'extreme' sports are available such as rafting, canyonning, paragliding and rock climbing, all good fun but a bit expensive.

Other than that (I swear we're almost there) I don't know much about the bars/clubbing (I moved to london when I was 11) but my little sister now lives in Pau, if that's your bag I'll ask her what's what. What I do know is that most of them are near the Palais, and if possible try and grab a tea/coffee on the promenade on a clear winter's day - you can see the what looks like the entire Pyrenees and it's quite frankly amazing. Anyway I hope this answers a few of your questions and if you have any more I'm here to help!

Edit: Re-read your post and sorry you don't imply that Pau is in the Basque Country - just a heads though, they still don't appreciate getting the two confused!",0,1320397156,null,0,true,0,c2wzbqx,t3_lzpz3,t1_c2wzbqx,t3_lzpz3,1427828792,4,false,france,t5_2qhjz,4

Well, I do think the EFSF will play a bigger role, but first some rules need to be adapted. Some new ones should be introduced, and some need to be altered. The countries that partake in the Eurozone should all take note that if they don't follow them, Europe will no longer ask nicely until infinity, if things get too bad, the EFSF and IMF will intervene. This should have a calming effect on those parties that are afraid of the ""Next Greece"" (because if say another country goes down tomorrow, Europe can do the whole bailout dance again).  Also monitoring and follow-up of this monitoring by the IMF/EFSF will become more prevalent I think.

Paraphrasing a Dutch interview with [Guy Verhofstadt (YouTube)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACaqX66qLes): Another prominent idea is that the Eurozone needs a fiscal union (at the moment there's only a monetary union). If I understand this right it would mean that the Eurozone creates European bonds/obligations (where one now only has obligations/bond markets per country, 17 different ones). One big central European treasury, which then could be used to defend the Euro from attacks from rating bureaus et al. But the countries who currently have ""good"" (AAA) ratings are afraid they might lose that rating by becoming part of that collective, as they could be tainted by the downward spiral of a country in problems.

true,[deleted],null,null,"There are not only ethnic and religious aspects of immigration, there is a third aspect which everybody forgots yet it plays the most important rule: you often get the backwards rural people as low-skilled migrants, not the modern city people.

It is typically not the modern Istanbul dude you get as a low-skilled or unskilled migrant. I know Istanbul people, mostly students, and their way of thinking is already like 90% European. They are likable... football, beer, jokes, parties, some deeper thoughts... not much Allah at all and if yes then not in a bad way. But you don't get these migrants for driving taxies and selling kebab.

Instead you get the semi-illiterate peasant from some backwards village in some godforsaken part of Anatolia where running water is still considered a miracle of Allah. This is the type of person you most like get as a low-skilled migrant.

So this person gets to Germany or Austria and people won't like him because he behaves like an obnoxious redneck and when did middle-class city people like that? Because he is one, he is from a backwards village. He will be basically Borat-ing his way around.  And then the people will say ""oh, these Muslims"" or ""oh these Turks"" and then other people will say to these people ""WTF you racists, chauvinists"", and they have a big conservative-liberal verbal deathmatch, but in reality, the problem with that person is not that he is Muslim and not that he is a Turk - it is that **he is a redneck from a backwards village**, and people are right that he does not fit in, they are only wrong in **why**.

Look, I was on the other side of this situation. I am from Hungary, I first moved to the UK, to Birmingham. I am a well-educated city boy.

I like how everyone is up in arms about a PM who said he wasn't going to bring the IMF in and when he came to power did so, but not a word is spoken of the 5% deficit that became 15% overnight. In essence you're saying that you're angrier at the lies of the pre-election opposition (that amount to words being spoken) than you are at the lies (that amount to fake reports that shaped the economy) that the government of 2004-2009 was telling Europe.

&gt;One who sells rights to extract oil/gas or uses them as collateral for loans from the markets

This is valid criticism. I totally agree. The resistive forces shouting ""treason"" though have been very counter-productive as can be also witnessed in the case of privatizations. Don't tell me everyone would be backing a PM who sells rights to -God forbid- American companies.

&gt;One who does not freeze relations with Russia 

This is a classic case of the grass being greener on the other side. You don't know what the Russians asked as collateral when they proposed to help. Why isn't Italy taking up on offers from Russia and China? Why isn't Portugal?

&gt;A PM who calls for a referendum for the original memorandum

That would have been dumb. If that happened then the Greek people would vote ""no"" (as they would not have been able to grasp -and some still can't- why a country with 5% deficit needs outside help) Things would turn from bad to worse, as the citizens from other countries would learn we had been lying to them all along and even at this point we weren't taking responsibility for it.

 Come on. The guy lied continuously and not only on this subject. He lied after becoming PM, saying he had not talked with IMF - then he covered this up saying he did talk to IMF officials but as counsels, not because he was planning to enter an IMF program. Which only adds insult to injury. Then DSK discloses he'd been in talks for months before the election. At some point maybe we'll say the PM is right and DSK is just not to be trusted, being a rapist and all.

  But i'm supposed to talk about the previous government and its budget deficit. Yes, they were terrible. I didn't vote for them, btw. But in this post we're talking about what a PM would have done differently. Lying to your people in a matter which brought us where we are today, is not justified because others lied to your people too, or even forced you to a bad, tight, spot. We cannot afford to look past this.

 If you enter a debate in who brought Greece to the current position, we both know there will be no end. At least all the governments in my lifetime have contributed to this. There is no single culprit and there is no excuse for our current or future government.

If the deal is not successful --&gt; country goes bankrupt --&gt; your bank goes bust --&gt; goodbye saving account (amongst other nice things).

Final point: if we haven't lied about our total debt and our deficit, it would have been impossible for us to get more loans, and get so deep into debt. Alogoskoufis, increased the reported Greek GDP by 30% in order to qualify for a bigger loan. Of course this meant that we were eligible for smaller EU support grants (we reported that we got rich after all), and we had to increase our contribution money to the EU in support for weaker countries. Fun fact (google it): this action by Alogoskoufis, got the 2nd place in that year's economic errors: 1st place was Kazakstan with a typo on its currency.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;It's all there is on the (national) news these days but it seems that US news or predominantly American websites like reddit don't care at all.

I don't live in America anymore so I can't say about TV broadcasts, but G-20 news has been on US news websites. It was frontpaged on CNN, NYT, Bloomberg, and Yahoo!Finance, and not really covered less than what I've seen on BBC and AJE. (Each of these sites has 1 prominent front page link to the G-20; Bloomberg has 3.) If there actually was less coverage, it would be for the following two reasons:

1. The G-20 and its action towards the European crisis directly affect Europeans. It's important for Americans too, but the consequences aren't *as* direct. Less impact, less coverage. If you visit a site like Bloomberg that has an American audience that probably owns stock in companies with direct interests in the health of the eurozone, stories about the G-20 and Greece are prominent.
2. October's unemployment numbers in the US just came out. Employment figures are big news, so that drowns out other news a bit. There's also been some other big news such as the collapse of MF Global and the massive Groupon IPO. It's not all about America, but it's also not all about Europe.

As for why it's not big on reddit:  Most redditors are in their 20s/30s, don't work in business, and probably don't have much in investments, if any. The issues with PIIGS are major, but if you don't have securities immediately hit by the European crisis or the business knowledge of how the problems will reverberate back at home, it's hard to care.",0,1320438353,null,0,false,0,c2x42q5,t3_m08m8,t1_c2x42q5,t3_m08m8,1427831031,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Because of that, many EU treaties are negotiated in an intransparant way, by people you never voted (One votes for the national parliament and the European Parliament, not for the national government and especially not for the foreign governments).

Slightly offtopic, but worth noting is the European Commission. This body has executive, legislative and judicairy power, so the seperation of power is not assured.Furthermore, these people have even less democratic legitimacy than the governments. There is no defined way in which the member states have to choose ""their"" commissioner and the European Parliament has only the possibility to reject a candidate, not to propose one.

In the long run, the EU has to strenghten the European Parliament, so it can speak with one voice (pushing european interests) instead of having 27 different powers struggling for influence or it has to return to mere international (instead of supranational) treaties.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Keep in mind that the EU's political system wasn't designed from the ground up. In a nation state, you typically have a point in history where you can start with a clean slate, write a constitution, and be done with it. Not so in the EU, where you have many countries and build layer after layer. Initially, it was just a handful that decided to build a common coal and steel industry to prevent future wars through economic entanglement. Over the years, this has been expanded to include other countries and the rest of the industries, services, free flow of capital, free movement of people, and for many a common currency.  
Each of these steps had to be taken one by one, and each time all the involved nation states had to give up a bit of their sovereignty, which in turn was a step their respective governments had to sell to their respective people each time.

If you approach trans-national matters democratically, you have certain practical problems. First of all, *before* something becomes an EU competence, the EU doesn't have any legitimacy for making decisions in this area (e.g., it's not up to a country's neighbors whether or not this country should cease border controls). So, to give up the piece of sovereignty in question has to be up to the individual member states on the national level.  
Next, how would democracy work? One person, one vote? The smaller countries wouldn't like that. One country, one vote? No way the larger ones would accept something like this.

In a democracy, you need a majority. But in the EU (or its predecessors), there were the issues mentioned above, so instead it required full consensus -- even tiny Malta could veto everything. The Treaty of Lisbon was written to address that, at least for some areas, and also to strengthen the European Parliament to make the EU more democratic. But of course, each member had to agree to that individually, and this process actually was a great example why this reform was necessary. The EU had simply become too big to always be able to agree on *everything*.

Because of this requirement to find consensus, you see a lot of pressuring of individual members into agreeing to a certain policy. If the EU was more democratic, this wouldn't be necessary -- that country simply would be overruled by the majority.

Problems with this approach become especially visible when a national policy in an area that the individual members still have full sovereignty over has consequences for other members. Greece technically still has full sovereignty over its fiscal policy. However, those decisions rather directly affect the stability of the financial system in all of the Eurozone, and indirectly the interest rates other threatened members have to pay, which in turn has the potential to bankrupt them. Because this has to be prevented *at all costs*, fiscal decisions in Greece can be very expensive for the tax payers in other countries or even threaten their standard of living.

This is a situation neither the EU nor the Eurozone were designed to handle, because it was never supposed to get to this point. The deal was that countries that joined the currency union had to be financially healthy upon entry and to keep their government financials within save parameters. The contracts had a ""no bailouts"" clause, so should one country get in trouble -- tough luck, you're on your own.  
But now that the situation has occurred, at a time when Europe's financial system is already vulnerable and several member states are threatened by economic collapse, governments have to deal with the situation and make things up as they go, all within a system that wasn't designed for such a situation and while explaining their respective electorates why their tax money has to pay for another country's expenses, and in this case it's one that isn't exactly the most effective when it gets to collecting taxes from all parts of its society.

&gt; Now with the situation in Greece, is there a possibility that the riots will force the Greek government to resign, in a manner similar to Tunisia/Egypt? I am aware of the differences, namely the Greek government being democratically elected has higher legitimacy and can strongly enforce its claim to govern until the end of its term. But if enough people and for a sustained amount of time oppose the government it will be pushed in a position where it has no more legitimacy. Is that possible?

This is another example of how theory and practice can be in conflict. In theory, yes, the government can legitimately represent the people until the end of the legislative period. But in practice, it loses this legitimacy if the people make it clear that the government, in fact, doesn't represent it anymore.

&gt; And what are the chances that the undemocratic nature of the EU will result in its eventual demise?

I think ""decay"" would be a better term. The more difficult it is for member states to find consensus, the less decisions get made. Further integration might come to a halt. The most extreme thing that could happen would be for individual members to leave, but the economic and political consequences of such a move would be so catastrophic that no sane government would ever do that.  
Instead, the opposite will happen. We'll see tighter integration, more competences will be handed over from the national to the European level, to prevent this from ever happening again. Some say this was the plan all along -- when the euro was created, the problems with a common currency without fiscal integration were well known, but to give up that much sovereignty was politically impossible on the respective national levels without the pressure of a crisis.

And that's where we're back at the core of this question, about democratic legitimacy. The more power Brussels has, the more democratic legitimacy it needs.

**Edit:**

&gt;  I am also curious as to why the European Parliament has gone with a population proportional representation of countries.

It hasn't, it uses a system of *degressive* proportionality. You can read about past, current and future allocation [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apportionment_in_the_European_Parliament). 

&gt; The US has equal state representation in the senate because it recognises at some level that each state regardless of size is an important member in its union.

The EU has equal member representation in the [Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/index_en.htm).

&gt; It seems like the EU in some cases wants to skip some steps and go straight to an advanced and established federation, and at other times it shies away from other aspects of federalism.

Again, there is no clean slate, new constitution approach like during the founding or after a revolution in a nation state. It has to be done step by step, and each member has to agree with every individual one. This requires are *a lot* of negotiations and compromises.

Anyway, how would *you* do it? How do you propose a better EU would look like, which competences should it have, and how would you get there in a way each individual member could realistically agree to?

What you have to keep in mind that EU is an de facto federation, consisting from the member states and the federal administration. In the EU level negotiations and decisions are made between the governments of member countries, some decisions are done with unanimity and some with qualified majority voting, however all decisions are at the end blessed by both the European parliament and parliaments of member states. This method of decision making ensures that different member states get their say on matters and the European project goes forward, which is the shared goal of all member states.

Now what goes to decision making inside member states that involves the EU, I don't see any problem of the EU and other member states to think again if a member state makes decision that goes against what was agreed before. Of course the member state either by parliament vote or by having a referendum can vote against it, that is their liberty, but that doesn't give indemnity from blame that comes when an common initiative or agreed settlement fails.

In case of referendums, they don't give any bigger moral authority than a parliament vote.

Just because it isn't apparent to observers what is happening doesn't mean it isn't happening in a completely democratic way.

In Ireland a second referendum was held because the first one started with a campaign of misinformation. Nonetheless, the second referendum was still a referendum held by the same country with a higher turnout. They voted again, more numerously, more informed, and they voted for. Maybe it isn't the democracy you like but it is still democracy. If you lose a vote doesn't mean that the winners are oppressing/bullying you, it means the majority decided something.


The Greek referendum is a bit more complex and to say that Greece has been strong armed into not doing so isn't true.
If they decide to falter and wait, with regards to the bailout they will be getting, it will change the effectiveness and outcome of the bailout. If they decide to not take it it would mean they would default. This in turn would have serious negative effects on every EU nation. By putting it to a referendum they are also endangering themselves and the EU.  Nonetheless, the worrying over a referendum has been an entirely Greek process.

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"&gt;Europe prides itself in its democratic states, but to an outside obersver it does not seem to be overly democratic at the EU level. It seems that a lot of the measure are pushed through the bureaucracy and then the EU uses its financial power to bully individual nations into accepting them.

&gt;Most recently this has been observed in Greece where the referendum (for better or for worse) was dropped, but also in Ireland where referendums were redone to get the results that were wanted (Lisbon Treaty). So it seems like democracy is not that crucial for the EU.

This is true. This is one of the most fundamental issues of the EU in its current state. It will have to be addressed in the medium term. In the short term, a solution is needed for the Euro crisis. Some consider these two to be one in the same.

&gt;Now with the situation in Greece, is there a possibility that the riots will force the Greek government to resign, in a manner similar to Tunisia/Egypt? I am aware of the differences, namely the Greek government being democratically elected has higher legitimacy and can strongly enforce its claim to govern until the end of its term. But if enough people and for a sustained amount of time oppose the government it will be pushed in a position where it has no more legitimacy. Is that possible?

What happened in Tunisia and Egypt was revolution. Their entire political system was upended and is now in the process of transition to democracy from autocracy. Greece is already a democracy. I don't know whether or not you are European yourself, but because this is a primarily English speaking website, and Americans make up the majority of user-base, I'll need to explain that the European sense of the term ""government"" is very different from the American sense of the word. A ""government"" in Europe typically refers to the executive (Prime Minister + Cabinet). For example, there is the Cameron government in the UK, and the Merkel government in Germany. When a government falls, it means the government (again, executive) has failed a vote of confidence in the parliament, usually by means of a simple majority vote. When a government falls, new elections are triggered, and the electorate votes for members of parliament. A European government, in an American context, is somewhat similar to what is referred to as the ""Obama Administration."" After a government falls, the political system of the country remains intact, thought a different party or coalition may come to power, thus forming a new government.

That aside, it is very, very unlikely that regime change could occur in Greece, despite the mess it is in. European leaders are keenly aware of the EU's ""democratic deficit."" This is the preferred term that is used to describe the lack of democratic institutions in the EU itself, despite there being a prerequisite for EU membership for a democratic system of government. The European Parliament was among the first ways to attempt to resolve this issue. This is the only directly elected body in the entire European Union. However, it lacks a great deal of power, making it a relatively insignificant institution. The biggest problem it has is that it does not have the power of legislative initiative, that is, the ability to introduce legislation. This makes it dependent on other institutions such as the European Council, Council of Minister, and the European Commission, all of which are not directly elected by the European people.

Ultimately, there are two paths that Europe can go down. One path leads back toward what resembles Europe prior to the Second World War. This is a Europe that lacks institutions meant to mediate disagreement and hostility between individual nations. One that makes travel and economic activity far more difficult and cumbersome than it is today. Most Europeans do not want this. Most agree that the EU serves a vital function, such as promoting free trade and expanding and enforcing the single market, among other things. The second path is one toward a single federal state, something akin to the United States of Europe. The European Union would be recognized as a sovereign state, and its member states, such as France and Germany, would be resigned to a status similar to American states, like California and New York. This path has been in the news a lot more frequently in recent months and years because of the current sovereign debt crisis. Already, the Eurozone is accelerating toward fiscal union. It is already a monetary union, though the Euro **will** fail if fiscal union is not eventually realized. The current crisis is a superficial problem of a much larger issue that is largely invisible to many Europeans and even moreso to non-Europeans.

I am not a European, though one day I hope to be. Of these two paths, I support the latter. If for only one reason, because it would represent the possibility of global federal government. Though this is a distant dream, should humanity ever endeavor to create a world government, its founders will look to the EU as an example. Supranational governments represent the once unthinkable possibility of the death of nationalism. I find it disheartening that humanity has been splintered for so long.

* ...how are you going to allocate the correct amount of study places and research grants for universities if you don't get input from industries on what they currently need and what they think that they might need in the future? In example in Finland during the 90s the state doubled the amount of yearly intake of specific engineering disciplines to support the growth of the Nokia lead telecommunications industry. Same too was made with the increase intake of computer science students due to needs of the industry.

* ...how are you going to increase work based immigration that is needed by different industries if you don't have industry input?

true,arkadian,EURO,European Union,"You are right, the EU does operate as a federation on the political level, but it's unusual in that for major political change (such as treaty reform) it needs the agreement of every member, even small nations (such as Ireland) have a veto.

The current question is entirely different because although the EU is politically a federal union, the Eurozone is an economic union and Greece is only a partner. Greece has been bailed out repeatedly, largely by a Germany that is doing so out of obligation (remember the German public are no more keen on this than the Greek public are on the austerity measures put in place there, yet the Greeks still expect their public sector workers and pensions to be paid). The fact is that Greece both needs to reform it's tax system to be more efficient and at a genuinely European standard, and reform it's public sector and sell off assets to cut the deficit. As a partner in the Eurozone Greece is obliged to do this, or should be expected to drop out. By putting the bailout to a referendum Papandreou was effectively asking the Greeks to make this choice, and that's why France and Germany insisted that the referendum question be about membership of the Euro and not simply that of the bailout alone. As Papandreou (and the Greek public) support continued membership of the Euro, putting the question to a referendum would have been redundant anyway.

Frankly Greece has been fortunate to maintain the continued economic support of Germany and now the wider international community as China is asked to help out. To even consider rejecting the bailout plan is insulting and I can see why Merkel and Sarkozy were not impressed. Greece, as a member of the Eurozone, has obligations to their European partners. As tighter tax and finance integration seems to be the path to a more secure and stable Eurozone, member states are going to have to get used to being told what to do by Frankfurt.",0,1320511621,null,0,false,0,c2xau6n,t3_m15ai,t1_c2xau6n,t1_c2x8vit,1427834345,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

This is taken from a survey in which the top reason people gave for voting no was 'I didn't understand it/it's too complicated.' Out of those concerns, only the last (3) had any basis in reality. Points 1 and 2 are nonsense and were never mentioned in the TEC; is their presence in the top answers in the survey legitimate reason for the other side to claim misinformation? I'd argue it probably was. Was this cause to call another referendum? Probably not. 

Yet I don't think the second referendum on the Lisbon Treaty was *entirely* called because the losers cried foul.

Sul finire degli anni 50' due geniali radioamatori, i fratelli Achille e Giovanni Judica Cordiglia, allestirono a Torino un vero e proprio centro di ascolto spaziale. Usando tecnologie riciclate e da loro stessi adattate, iniziarono a captare suoni dallo spazio. Il 4 ottobre 1957 riuscirono a intercettare per primi i suoni emessi dallo Sputnik 1. Questo straordinario successo fu il primo risultato cui seguirono altre intercettazioni di tutte le principali missioni spaziali realizzate dagli USA e dall'URSS: incluso alcune missioni segrete, in cui alcuni cosmonauti sovietici potrebbero aver perso la vita. Nel mezzo della guerra fredda, mentre le due grandi superpotenze si sfidavano nella corsa allo spazio, pretendendo di controllare le informazioni e la propaganda, due radioamatori, hackers ante-litteram, registravano tutto.

true,Seefor,DENK,Copenhagen,"&gt; Mersch said the ECB did not want to become a lender of last resort to help the euro zone solve its debt crisis and said it was concerned that its job could be made more difficult by governments that ""don't meet their responsibilities.""

They are going to have to at some point. The situation as it is now is untenable. They could solve the entire crisis in a moment by letting the ECB become a lender of last resort, just as all other normal central banks are.

Of course this would have to be followed up by more political integration of the economies of the EU, to make sure that countries won't speculate in this and continue irresponsible economic policies. Because if they do, and the ECB has to print the needed money, then inflation will be the result, which is also why the Germans are opposed to making the ECB a lender of last resort. For the Germans the ECB's only job is price stability.

I wonder if they won't have to change their opinion of the ECB's role if this crisis escalates further. The fact that the ECB is already buying troubled bonds is an indication that they realise it's necessary to some extent.

Well, Zed, that's a bit complicated because like all places, America has a lot of different types of music that appeal to different groups/subcultures. I'll do my best to be helpful, but keep in mind this is just the perception of a not-terribly-with-it-anymore twenty-something white guy. People from other backgrounds may have a very different view!

Most places also have ""Top 40"" or ""Today's hits!"" stations that play whatever music is selling best at the time, and we can use this as a rough guide to what's selling nationally.  These are the artists you can buy at national music chains, and on stations that focus on.

Of late, these stations tend to be dominated by R&amp;B, rock and roll variants, and techno-influenced pop music that is easy to dance to. The top-selling song in the country right now is by Rhianna, an R&amp;B artist.

It is not unusal, for hip-hop or country music to make the list, but they tend to be mass-appeal songs without too much violence (hip-hop) or acoustic twanginess (country).

Quick note on those two example, and some of the racial/social connotations they have: Many northerners, city-dwellers, and minorities associate this music with dumb/white/redneck/trashy people, but in the southern US, it is much more likely to hear this music playing, say on the loudspeakers at a mall.

While often portrayed as ""black"" music, hip-hop is popular with people of all races. While you'll still find an occasional old guy who complains about it, hip-hop is now very mainstream. Despite this, American movies still use rap to suggest that the characters are young/edgy/hip or black (which American filmakers seem to think of as much the same thing).

I mention the movie thing because one of your specific examples, *(which were surely not chosen for sarcastic reasons nosir)*, mentioned jazz in movies. Jazz is something a niche interest in the 21st century, and so knowledge of it is often used in movies to represent a character as refined and classy, though not quite stuffy enough to listen to classical orchestral music. 

Martin still performs, but he is not nearly as popular as he once was.

A note on other genres: There are plenty of types of music with sizable devout followings that don't have the mainstream national visibility of the stuff I mentioned. ""Tejano"", a hybrid of Texan and Mexican styles is beloved in parts of Texas, but practically unheard of in much of the eastern seaboard. ""Dubstep"", a form of electronic music, is becoming quite popular with the younger crowd, but doesn't get a lot of mainstream radio play.

I sure that helps, Zed!",0,1320624956,null,0,false,0,c2xn0su,t3_m0szy,t1_c2xn0su,t1_c2x9sxt,1427840326,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3
