true,fizenut,null,null,"That may be true, but I still don't see why including the ""ein"" would be wrong because of that, and that is what you're saying. There can be multiple correct ways to express something, you know.

On top of that, everything that I can dig up via google says that Kennedy was spot on and that omitting the ""ein"" would not have been correct. Kennedy wasn't actually saying that he is from Berlin (he quite obviously wasn't), he was expressing solidarity with Berliners. That is a completely different context. So while your statement

&gt;When you are trying to say that you are a citizen of a city no article is included. That was and still is proper German.

is factually correct, it doesn't apply to the situation at hand.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ich_bin_ein_Berliner#Jelly_doughnut_misconception
&gt; However, the indefinite article ein is omitted when speaking of an individual's profession or residence but is necessary when speaking in a figurative sense as Kennedy did. Since the president was not literally from Berlin but only declaring his solidarity with its citizens, ""Ich bin Berliner"" would not have been correct.[4]

&gt;Abgesehen davon, dass der unbestimmte Artikel im Deutschen korrekterweise bei Nomen verwendet wird, die als Stellvertreter einer Klasse auftreten, war der Ausdruck „Berliner“ für den Berliner Pfannkuchen im Berlin der 1960er Jahre so gut wie unbekannt, da dieser dort einfach nur „Pfannkuchen“ heißt. Der Satz ist also korrekt und wurde auch vor der Rede entsprechend geprüft. Das Gelächter des Publikums bezog sich auf eine darauffolgende Bemerkung des Präsidenten, mit der er dem Simultandolmetscher für die Übersetzung seines deutschen Satzes ins Deutsche dankte.

http://www.extraflach.de/blog/2010/10/03/ich-bin-kein-berliner/
&gt;Nun muss ich hier sicherlich nicht näher erläutern, dass Ich bin ein Berliner die einzige Möglichkeit ist, im Deutschen genau das zum Ausdruck zu bringen, was Kennedy sagen wollte (Eichhoff 1993). Der Punkt ist ein anderer: natürlich kann man mit dem Ausspruch auch meinen, man sei ein Spritzgebäck, sollte man sich in einer Situation wiederfinden, die die Identifikation mit einer Windbeutelmutation erfordert. Das ist das Fünkchen Wahrheit dieser Legende. Aber wäre an der zweiten Lesart mehr dran, als ein äußerst schwaches Missverständnispotential, wäre der angeblich so peinliche Fehler nicht fast 25 Jahre unbemerkt gebleiben. In Deutschland segelt der scheinbare Lapsus sogar seit über 47 Jahren nahezu unbeachtet unterm Radar. Immerhin kann man nicht behaupten, dass Kennedys Ich bin ein Berliner alsbald in Vergessenheit geriet – es ist einer der Sätze der deutschen Nachkriegsgeschichte überhaupt. Aber eben nicht, weil Kennedy sich als Pfannkuchen outete.

Dortmund has anything you need. If you live on campus in a Studentenwohnheim, a grocery store is in walking distance. The power converter is a very good idea.

I grew up in Do and went to uni there. So if you have any questions, ask away.

Things to do: For drinks and bars find the Kreuzviertel. Lots of good bars and pubs. There is also a good little club there: Silent Sinners. Also for clubbing and concerts: FZW near the Hauptbahnhof. They have good concerts and clubnights. (The audience for some of the clubnights is a littel older, though.) If you like it rough an dirty, go to the Spirit. It is a club owned by the local biker gang. Better after 2 or 3 am, best very drunk !

Dortmund brews its own mircobrew: Hövels. Go out for a traditional German food and beer night in the Hövelsbrauerei. Maybe after you saw a play in the theatre. The ""Studiobühne"" in the ""Schauspielhaus"" has pretty good experimental stuff going on and tickets are half off for students (bring your student ID).

Do you like climbing? Dortmund has the best climbing hall of the whole Ruhrpott (that is what we call the Ruhrgebiet). It is on the outskrits, but well worth it (www.kletterhalle-bergewerk.de).

In the summer: Rombergpark and Westfalenpark for some great walks. For some beer drinking (and other things) at night: West Park

The Nordstadt may look a little rough at the beginning, but you will find some very good ethnic food there and some cool bars, too. In the summer, there is even a beach bar in the (industrial) harbor.

For getting away I would recommend the nearby lakes (Möhne, Sorpe, etc.) All the other surrounding towns have cool stuff. Bochum for example also has a very cool bar scene. You can travel for free with your Stundtenticket in all of NRW. Make use of it. But do not even try to understand the train system, just ask other people to help you.

For being up to date, get a Coolibri magazine at the beginning of the month. You will find it in most bars to take for free. It will give you info on the best things to do in town.

Have fun in Dortmund. It is a great place. At the beginning you might think that it is ugly, since a lot of its pretty parts were destroyed in WWII and rebuilt in the 50s and 60s. But be assured, it has a lot of pretty places, is very diverse, has a lot of ""underground"" culture. The people are a little rough in the beginning, but have a ""soft heart under a rough shell"". (That's a German saying: Harte Schale, weicher Kern.)

If you meet Prof. Walter Grünzweig (which I am sure you will): He is awesome.

Nevertheless, I'm giving a fairly traditional POV on what is the *political content* of that term, eg :

&gt;ANARCHY,—the absence of a master, of a sovereign, 30—such is the form of government to which we are every day approximating, and which our accustomed habit of taking man for our rule, and his will for law, leads us to regard as the height of disorder and the expression of chaos. 

Proudhorn, What is property

http://www.gutenberg.org/files/360/360-h/360-h.htm

Kropotkin gives your etymology, but with the same political content:

&gt;ANARCHISM (from the Gr. αν, and αρχη, contrary to authority), the name given to a principle or theory of life and conduct under which society is conceived without government - harmony in such a society being obtained, not by submission to law, or by obedience to any authority, but by free agreements concluded between the various groups, territorial and professional, freely constituted 

http://www.panarchy.org/kropotkin/1905.eng.html

but, agreed, it is a minor tangent (and initially a just a short sentence), which is why I'm sad you haven't addressed anything else in any of the posts. So let me try making my point perfectly explicit:

you say:

&gt;The second there is a group there is also an alpha male/female which is a form of leadership.

and lets say it is. however how is the fact a group tends to converge on listening to a particular individual incompatible with having a society where one is free to listen or not to anyone, to any extent one chooses? (that was my Dawkins vs Pope analogy; both opinions influential to a group, but only the latter's binding to its group) A society where:

&gt;The legislative power belongs only to the reason, methodically recognized and demonstrated. To attribute to any power whatever the **right of veto or of sanction**, is the last degree of tyranny. Justice and legality are two things as independent of our approval as is mathematical truth. To **compel**, they need only to be known; to be known, they need only to be considered and studied. What, then, is the nation, if it is not the sovereign,—if it is not the source of the legislative power?

&gt;The nation is the guardian of the law—the nation is the EXECUTIVE POWER. Every citizen may assert: ""This is true; that is just;"" but **his opinion controls no one** but himself.

Proudhorn, same link

or where

&gt;man would not be limited in the **free exercise of his powers** in productive work by a capitalist monopoly, maintained by the state; nor would he be limited in the exercise of his will by **a fear of punishment, or by obedience** towards individuals or metaphysical entities, which both lead to depression of initiative and servility of mind. He would be guided in his actions by his own understanding, which necessarily would bear the impression of a **free action and reaction** between his own self and the ethical conceptions of his surroundings.

Ce qui est conseillé, c'est d'éviter les clients P2P (comme les le bittorrent) car c'est assez facile de récupérer l'IP de toutes les personnes qui téléchargent ou partagent un fichier.

Si vous tenez à être en sécurité, il vous reste 2 solutions : 

-Soit vous téléchargez uniquement en DDL/streaming, et vous prenez presque aucun risque. En effet, c'est comme si vous consultiez un site et votre IP n'est pas rendu publique à des milliers d'utilisateurs !

-Soit vous prenez un VPN. Facile à configurer, parfois gratuit mais souvent payant (de l'ordre de quelques euros par mois) cette solution vous permet de faire un ""tunnel sécurisé"" qui fera en sorte qu'on ne verra pas VOTRE IP mais une IP située en suède par exemple :)

The first four of the submarines cost €1.6bn ($2.3bn), I doubt the other two make up for the rest to get to the $6bn stated in the article. The first one was made in Germany, reportedly had technical issues initially and will be resold. Greece will keep the five that are under construction in Greece.

The order for the first four was made a decade ago, which is still after they ordered the French Mirage fighters. The only French Helicopters I could find something about were 12 utility helicopters. The US fighters were ordered in 2005.

I'm not saying that Greece's military budget isn't too large, but the article fails to mention that the orders it cites were made over the course of a decade, and the figures are at the very least questionable.

Edit: According to SIPRI's [database](http://armstrade.sipri.org/arms_trade/toplist.php), Greece's combined weapons imports over the past ten years were worth 10 billion in 1990's dollars, which would be $17.5bn today. That's an average of $1.75bn per year, or half a percent of Greece's GDP.

No it's not, change comes from within, our grandparents and parents are responsible for our democracy. No amount of pressure from the Allies could have made us democrats if we wouldn't have wanted to. Also ignoring the time before 1933 isn't fair to the democratic history of our country, which is a very long one. Democracy in Germany didn't just erupt from nothingness in '45.

&gt;Our democracy is the result of millions upon millions of brutally murdered civilians. Some people say as Germans, we should be proud of great thinkers and inventors who happened to be German. I did nothing to make these thinkers and inventors who they are.

Society shaped them, we are part of society, ergo ... But I concur  that this a highly debatable question and is true for every tribe, nation, Volk in the world, not just Germans. So this has nothing to do with you being able to be proud to be a German or not.

&gt;Being proud of Germany means ignoring Auschwitz. Nazi Germany wasn't ""Hiter-Deutschland"". The whole nation (with few exceptions) ignored, supported or took part in the discriminations, the boycotts, and the mass murders.

This is so much Bullshit wrapped up into so few sentences I can hardly believe it. First of all Germany is 2000 years of history not just 12, you want to reduce all that Germany is into just the time between '33 and '45 and ignore everything else just because of some idiotic sense of shame? You just said that you can't be proud of something someone else did just because he or she shares your ethnicity, so why are you ashamed of something someone else did just because he or she shares your ethnicity? 
Every generation of Germans make their own choices and creates it's own Germany. Yes I can be and am proud to be German, because I am a part of this country, a part of it's society, a part of it's history and myths. My friends, my family and my coworkers are shaping this country like their parents before them and if you can't see that, then I am very sorry for you.

Wearing a brand with no Nazi links in order to express Nazi sympathies helped bypass strict laws concerning the public display of Nazi symbolism (...) 

&gt;Lonsdale reacted to this trend by sponsoring anti-racist events and campaigns, and by refusing to deliver products to known neo-Nazi retailers. In 2003, the ""Lonsdale Loves All Colours"" campaign was launched, emphasizing non-white fashion models, along with increased support for initiatives that combat racism.
(Source: [WP:EN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonsdale_\(clothing\)))

You may guess what happened... [CONSDAPLE](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Consdaple) is one of the many (not-so-)innocent clothing labels of the far right. Actually, due to the rather strict laws (interesting read [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strafgesetzbuch_section_86a)) concerning the whole subject of Nazi symbolism in Germany, neo-Nazis have developed new brands, symbols and clothes that are legal under the law - but still show what they believe in. Lately, they have been copying the aesthetics of the German [militant anti-fascists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifaschistische_Aktion): black bloc tactics, appearance, terminology and symbols.

It's a cat-and-mouse-game, really. *sigh*

We also drive our Mercedes-Benz on the Autobahn. And as far as I see, at least the younger ones talk about the war, are well-educated about the Third Reich and stive to not let this happen again (the majority is, at least). No need to be overly concerned. But if you run into someone wearing Consdaple, Thor Steinar, Masterrace, anything featuring an 18 or 88, Good Night Left Side or Nordmann, well... maybe don't mention the war at all.

Had the Germans not lost the war we would not live in a democracy today. Most of ""our (great-)grandparents"" were Nazis or at least supported the Nazis before they realized that they would lose the war. 

The foundation that made a democracy possible was the allied intervention in World War II. After the war ended, they planned and discussed ways to bring Germany back up, including, for example, the Marshall Plan, the Denazification programs and so on. 

&gt; No amount of pressure from the Allies could have made us democrats if we wouldn't have wanted to. 

It's not so much about pressure but rather good will, encouragement and support. Yes, Germans wrote the ""Grundgesetz"", but they would never have been able to create a democratic state on their own. 

&gt;  Also ignoring the time before 1933 isn't fair to the democratic history of our country, which is a very long one. 


The Weimar republic lasted 14 years.
 






&gt; this is so much Bullshit wrapped up into so few sentences I can hardly believe it. 

&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

&gt; First of all Germany is 2000 years of history not just 12

Germany is not 2000 years of history. ""Germany"" was a cluster of more than 300 states until the 19th century. With the foundation of the *German Kaiserreich* (monarchial empire) in 1871 did it become a nationstate. That's 140 years.

&gt; you want to reduce all that Germany is into just the time between '33 and '45 and ignore everything else 

No, I don't. But I do believe that the sheer brutality and the methods used by Germans to slaughter 6,3 Million Jews, at least 100.000 Roma and Sinti, more that 100.000 handicapped persons, 20.000 Communists and Social Democrats and thousands of others in *factories* build to kill human beings does justify to give the Holocaust and the Third Reich a high importance in the history of our nation. 

&gt;  just because of some idiotic sense of shame? 

Neither is it a sense of shame nor is it idiotic to point out that Germany's history includes the Holocaust and to say that it is by far the most important aspect of our history as well. Also, I don't appreciate being called idiotic. 

&gt; You just said that you can't be proud of something someone else did just because he or she shares your ethnicity, so why are you ashamed of something someone else did just because he or she shares your ethnicity?

At no point did I say that I as a *person* am responsible for the  Holocaust. But as soon as someone prides him or herself on being German, the issue becomes highly problematical for the reasons I pointed out. 

&gt;  Every generation of Germans make their own choices and creates it's own Germany. 

Looking at the results of the study that I mentioned, one finds that 29.1 % of Germany's school students have Xenophobic views, 20,6% have Chauvinistic (Germans are better than others) views. Read the study, or at least take a look at the numbers. They prove that nationalistic, racist, antisemitic and similar views are very present in German society, not only in openly Right-Wing circles. 

&gt; Yes I can be and am proud to be German, because I am a part of this country, a part of it's society

I don't understand how that's something to be *proud* of. It's something to be *happy* about, maybe, but what have you done to become German?

&gt; a part of it's history and myths.

I think my view on the history part is clear. And did you write any of the myths? 



&gt; Btw.:
The numbers don't seem to shock or worry you. Let me put them into perspective: 

23,59 % of all Germans have voted for the CDU in the 2009 Bundestag-Election. 34,3% of all Germans think that ""The foreigners only come here to exploit the social state and 23,6 % think that ""What Germany now needs is one single, powerful Party that represents the whole ""Volksgemeinschaft"".

16,08 % of all Germans voted for the SPD in the 2009 Bundestag-Election. 17,2 % of all Germans believe that ""Jews still have too much influence"".

10,16 % of all Germans voted for the FDP in the 2009 Bundestag-Election. 14,3 % of all Germans believe that ""Jews are more likely to use dirty tricks that others to enforce their interests""

... you get the drift. 




&gt; It seems to me that you have a big problem with your attitude, maybe you should think about that.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm from Croatia. In principle I agree with you, the only thing that can justify murder or attempted murder (or grave bodily harm say by attacking w something dangerous in a non-lethal manner; though really I think the only two options are trying/threatening to kill or doing nothing, since trying to restrain someone is so dangerous I'd never consider it an option) is self-defense or defense of another, otherwise one doesn't take the law into his/her hands (or beyond in this case). So yes, if you kill/(seriously) injure a person, no matter when where and how, you should always be trialed, and lets see how the claim of self defense stands up. (or rather, if the prosecution can demonstrate otherwise, presuming I understand correctly how the burden of evidence would normally fall in that case).

In practice though, having someone forcibly enter your house, unless you have reason to know otherwise, I think its a reasonable assumption in the generic case that your life/health, and not just your property is in grave and immediate danger. And that the law should recognize you were operating under such reasonable assumption in the generic case. So say defending your house w a gun, if having one is legal that is, seems legitimate unless the intruder **clearly** doesn't pose (further) danger - like by being an incoherent unarmed drunk not making any particularly violent advances, (or unable), or someone already fleeing at first sign of trouble (If by mistake you give him/her any such signs, or warn him intentionally). 

Shooting w/o warning someone sneaking in the dark? I'm not sure I  (if I had any weapons or knew how to use them) would be such a good shot to risk giving warning and getting a bullet myself, rather than taking an opportunity and shooting the moment I thought I had a clear shot. 

I'd probably actually do exactly as you suggest, lock myself in and call police, just because I don't believe I could drive them away or kill them. But given that this is far from being really safe, I wouldn't convict someone who in the similar situation though he/she had better chances by amounting some defense.

Actually, the lower floor of our family house was broken into by a rambling drunk once. It has a separate entry and no connection to where we were living though, so we called the police, and it all went perfectly ok.

In practice ""reasonable force"" is a bit complicated because our laws pertaining to burglars and self-defense up here are annoyingly nanny-stateish and open for interpretation. 

Here a burglar or an assailant armed with a knife for example is not legally considered an ""all bets are off"" situation. The response has to always be proportional according to the law here and for some reason knives are not considered as lethal as guns. In general I agree with the principle of proportional force but here at least the application of the law is a bit random and the whole legal situation is fuzzy. The judgement of the court, for mugging a burglar, can be exhonorating or you might end up with 6 months of deferred prison time and 10,000 euros in compensation for the perpetrator.

If you shoot a burglar armed with a knife you will probably get a sentence for manslaughter and/or excess force in self-defense. Apparently an axe or a gun is considered dangerous enough to warrant lethal force but a knife necessarily doesn't. I think this is rather silly. There's plenty of cases where Finns have been convicted for defending their homes/persons with excess force. 

Apparently it would be convenient for the police and the legal system if you just run away, yell for help and call 112. Even harshly wrestling an assailant to the ground can get you into legal trouble and make you liable for compensation to the perp if you happen to break his nose in the scuffle. I think we have one of the most perpetrator protective laws on the planet and it sucks. If you break into my house you can at least expect a few cracked ribs and bruises and it just doesn't fit my sense of justice that I would have to pay for your ""pain and suffering"" because of something that happened completely due to your own stupidity. 

The idea that you should always be able to rationally analyze the situation and never use excessive force is ridiculous. How would the judges and the lawmakers themselves react to a masked guy skulking downstairs at 4 AM? Kindly ask them to leave the premises? Really?

Every person in holland is required to have identification with them at all times, for starters. And you do really need a passport to cross the border officially.

It's just that, at the regular borders they don't _check_ for a passport.

&gt;Serbs, really? How? I know they can't enter Croatia without a passport, how come they can come to Holland?

I don't know. But what little we have of organised crime is usually Serbian here. Something about their violent history vs how we deal with criminality, makes this like a DisneyWorld for them. People are never armed, never fight back and if you get caught you get a cell to yourself, books and xbox for a couple of years.

I'm not saying most Serbians are criminals. But the more violent part of the organised crime here is. It's not like we don't have dutch criminals, just that they usually aren't very violent. 

I guess there are people from Serbia that have such a history that they value a life less than most would. They go in guns blazing. The neighbourhood where my parents used to live actually had issues with a Serbian gang coming in at night, waking you up, and collecting car keys with a gun in your face.

The payout (just a car), the violence (guns), the scare (in your own home) and the targets (general public) was quite different from the normal balance of things here.

true,Britzer,GERM,Germany,"There are some big cultural differences between Europe and the US. But I think the more vigilante and revenge culture in the US is not the root. I think it is our instinct to want revenge. The US simply has the oldest free democracy. So politicians that campaign on 'law and order' get elected. They even vote judges and police (sheriff) into office. And those also campaign on 'tough on crime'. That not only results in a horrible, horrible criminal justice system in the US (once someone points a finger at you, prison rape is socially accepted in the US), but also in a differenct view of criminals themselves. So it is more acceptable to use excessive force against presumed wrongdoers. Not only by private citizen, but also by the police. The overuse of tasers has become legendary. In Europe the equivalent force dogma (you may not use deadly force against someone who might only hurt you) is more of an elitist concept. While right in an ethical, theoretical and philosophical way this goes against our basic instincts. 

I believe those basic instincts (to use excessive force if the other party is believed to be in the wrong) would also prevail in Europe, if we had a more direct democracy.

Please note, that I don't say one is right and one is wrong. While I prefer the more balanced European approach to the use of force in a confrontation, deep down I am also a libertarian democrat that believe in democracy. And if the majority in a society wants a certain thing, it is their right to have it. ",0,1309440550,null,0,false,0,c22sprk,t3_icmkc,t1_c22sprk,t3_icmkc,1427300445,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Usually **not**. However, some courts sentenced that landlords cannot forbid *small* animals, like hamsters or rabbits. It's unsure if cats or small dogs are also small animals in terms of those sentences.

&gt; Second, what is a typical cost for rent?

That depends on the city or region you're living in. Rent is listed per month. Hamburg, Munich, Cologne are widely considered as very expansive, while Berlin is much cheaper. Also, there's a distinction between the so-called *Kaltmiete*, which is the raw rent for your space, and the *Warmmiete*, which is the *Kaltmiete* plus the *Nebenkosten*. These are additional costs, like taxes, costs for a janitor or something like that, fees for garbage disposal, the costs of hot water and heating, and so on. The prices you see are always *Kaltmiete* (or *kalt*) and only *Warmmiete* (or *warm*) if it is particularly listed as such. Sometimes, the *Nebenkosten* can be as much as half the *Kaltmiete*! Where I live, a total rent - *Warmmiete* - of ten or eleven euro per square meter is considered normal.

true,Jockel,null,null,"yes it is very reliable, and you can find lots of apartments without a provision, but keep looking for apartments that are marked with EBK, that means they already have a kitchen so you don't have to buy one. What you could also do is look at www.wg-gesucht.de for a room. A ""WG"" is a living arangement with 1 or more people it's like the same if you would move in with 2 of your friends into a 3-bedroom house. If you are renting keep in mind there is no 1-bedroom or 2-bedroom description...the price is set by m². A 2 room apartment means there is one bedroom and one living room, the kitchen and bathroom are not considered rooms. Many students use a potential living room as another bedroom to save money. Also apartments usually don't have a 1 or 2-year lease but you can just cancel your lease 3 month in advance of the date of moving out. The deposit for an apartment is usually 2 Kaltmieten (rent without the additional maintenance costs).

I just signed a lease for an apartment in Hannover 70m², 2 room, location would be considered ""downtown"", for 400€ Kaltmiete and 525€ Warmmiete. 125€ are building maintenance, garbage disposal etc...with additional costs of water, gas, electricity, internet I think I will be at around 650€ and because I don't need a living room this is going to be a WG it's 325€ per person and that is a normal rent in hannover per person...

I would recommend looking for a WG at wg-gesucht.de is a better option if money is an issue. because renting a place on your own can use some startupmoney. And I think you might need some furniture and if you have to buy everything new for a whole apartment its going to be expensive.

some other things that came to mind: 

There is no deposit for electricity here...you pay a monthly price calculated on how much kWh you will probably use and after a year they look how much you actually used and then you get money back or have to pay something extra...

you don't need a car, public transportation in a city is excellent and a monthly ticket can be a bit pricey but it will be cheaper than driving around with a car.
