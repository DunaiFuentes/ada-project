But I don't believe it. His comments in dokument.no point to a young ultra conservative and the attack was pointed to left wing liberal politics - who in his position are responsible for multikulti (for him an ""ideology"" designed by Communists to destroy the nation states of Europe) and are letting Muslims in. Seems like he thinks that having Muslims is a thread to Norway and the only solution is the right wing and murdering people. He calls the American conservatives not really comparable to European conservatives, because the US Republicans are too mild towards multikulti. He calls the protestant church (where he was active) in Norway a joke and thinks it should go back to its Catholic roots.

Being a ~~brainwashed dumb fuck~~ religious person is part of being a conservative. It's just that in his world everything seems to be driven to to absolute radical end.

It won't be kind to you if you buy cheap liquor. It's usually better to pay a bit more and get something decent. German vodka tastes exceptionally bad, but it's easily recognizable by the low price and the common bottle shape many of those brands share -- roughly a cone with a round bulge near the top, presumably to resemble the Kremlin, and often named after famous Russian politicians. Avoid those at all cost, any Polish or Russian vodka will be much better. Russian Standard is good and still affordable.  
If it's colored or comes in small bottles, especially if they try to be funny, don't buy it. Do *not* buy cheap whiskey or rum, either, the next morning you'll wish you had gotten the slightly more expensive Havana Club. However, if you want to have some gin and tonic, cheap gin is OK (it won't be a great gin and tonic, but at least it won't give you a headache). Have some döner kebab before you crawl home, and you'll be fine the next day.

You have to pay utilities in advance as a progress payment. In the end of the year you will get a bill. If you are lucky you will get a refund but often you have to pay a little bit more (heating is usuly the biggest element of uncertainty).

* [Garbage](http://www.mannheim.de/buerger-sein/muellgebuehren): depends on the size of your trash can and the collection cycle. It starts with 14,50 € for 80 liters, collection every 14 days. What really helps to reduce your waste for the trash can is a ""Biotonne"". It's for organic waste like fruit... (+4,30€)

* Heating: Depends on your consumption and the type of heating system. So it is hard to estimate. The german renter association says: for year 2009 on average it's 0,84€/m³ and month.
* There could be other things included as well like a cleaner for the staircase, a house management, janitor, parking... This really depends on the flat.

ora però devo mettere qualcosa sul fuoco... perché? malgrado le piccole (che sono in ambito diretto delle persone ed il classico viver di ogni giorno... anche se questi sono personaggi di alto livello nelle loro congreghe), vedo comunque un'insofferenza nei miei confronti da parte di questi gruppi del male (e trovo giusto mettere qualcosa di scritto... che non si sa mai!!!)!

potete tranquillamente vederlo come un attacco di psicosi acuta, non me ne posso preoccupare di come possono esser viste delle dichiarazioni simili per chi non ha la follia in corpo (o la conoscenza... ma questa è questione personale)!

questo  Anders Behring Breivik nella sua stoltezza (ed'è per questo che lo hanno inserito nella fratellanza ""BASTARDA"") e confusione ideale ha dato molto materiale a quei opinionisti (io sono sempre molto buono e come tali li paragono... ma molte persone li reputano ""giornalai di regime"") che hanno visto in questa persona un ""fondamentalismo"" cristiano e la sua appartenenza a gruppi di ""estrema destra""! 

credetemi... da quando due amici abbastanza potenti in termini nazionali(e si potrebbe dire anche oltre in alcuni periodi della storia, comunque prima che morissero) mi consigliarono di guardare l'oltre, anche se in effetti avvolte io stesso ho la sensazione di andar in cerca dei mulini a vento, penetrando la stessa casualità e controllando l'ipotesi ""nel"" risultato, mi ritrovai in quel che è un mondo pericoloso! del non sapere è vero! il problema non riguarda solo l'incapacità personale del non riuscire ad esporre la conoscenza acquisita, ma sopratutto la complessa e basica conoscenza che bisogna avere per interpretare alcuni, chiamiamoli così, simbolismi delle azioni!

malgrado le massonerie si richiamano alla ""fratellanza"" avevo già intuito molto tempo fa che ci fosse uno scontro in atto (cosa già ""descritta"", e riportata poi nello scritto pubblico, in un discorso fra me, amici ed alcuni massoni di alto livello che avevano partecipato... come al solito... comunque guardate che talvolta mi stupisco anch'io dell'attenzione che mi dedicano questi personaggi visto che basterebbe la sola ""non considerazione"" per annullarmi... ma forse hanno capito anche loro... ;) !

ritornando al fatto norvegese... ma ho paura di creare ancor più confusione (nel momento... ma quando sarà tempo capirete!)...  gli organi di comunicazione di massa non ricordano che la Norvegia aveva assunto una politica filo-palestinese dichiarando di votare, a settembre, a favore della costruzione di uno stato palestinese in ambito ONU. che  i proventi del petrolio norvegese sono introitati direttamente dallo Stato Norvegese e non dalle compagnie petrolifere private e che lo scorso anno la Norvegia aveva escluso due aziende israeliane dallo sfruttamento di pozzi petroliferi del Mare del Nord. non si ricorda che la Norvegia aveva annunciato di ritirare le sue truppe dalla guerra in Libia, e non dicono che almeno dal 2002 la Commissione Europea aveva accusato la Norvegia di non adottare una ""legislazione bancaria"" compatibile con quello dell'Unione Monetaria Europea.Infatti, la Banca Centrale Norvegese é in mano pubblica mentre la Banca centrale Europea é una SPA privata partecipata dalle Banche Centrali nazionali a loro volta private. In Norvegia il guadagno da signoraggio non é gestito dai banchieri privati ma redistribuito ai norvegesi... detto così sono tutte belle cose (forse per alcuni non sono proprio tutte belle, ma in generale è così!)... ergo...

ditemi... come state vedendo lo stato norvegese??? fate mente locale... questi input che vi hanno trasmesso in questi giorni erano così come si potrebbe intuire dalle loro scelte in termini politici, bancari, ecc... oppure in questo momento avete una considerazione estraniata??? &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

non voglio andare troppo oltre perché vorrei che chi ha capacità (psicotiche) intuisca da solo ( non mi darebbe la colpa di avergli rovinato la vita... perché alla fine ci sarebbe arrivato)...

l'intuizione: -La Norvegia è stata punita!-.

volendo mettere direttamente il tutto (anche se causerà di primo acchito l'avversione), questo killer teleguidato o ipnotizzato che consuma il disegno dei potenti fa pensare ad una evoluzione. il Big Brother sta preparandoci a subire stragi e attacchi. killers coperti dai servizi delle massime potenze occidentali che più odiano il mondo arabo e l'Europa.Stavolta lo psicopatico che avrebbe compiuto le stragi è stato identificato in un fondamentalista cristiano (?), eppur massone (!), impregnato dell'ideologia anti-islamica dettata dalla grande impostura americana definita “scontro di civiltà”. E viene considerato di “estrema destra”. guerre striscianti, pianificate e gestite dalla cupola multinazionale, difficilmente le cose avvengono per caso, dobbiamo temere che quella di Oslo possa rappresentare una svolta tattica nella strategia stragista.per dare una direzione, questa svolta tattica ci ricorda la “strategia della tensione” in Italia, allorquando i gruppi di controllo atlantici che manipolavano, armavano, proteggevano e utilizzavano i gruppi armati della sinistra, per permettere loro di fare un salto di qualità e di scatenare con tutta tranquillità quelle offensive i cui effetti avrebbero concesso ai direttori d'orchestra di limitare le sovranità nazionali e di ristrutturare il sistema internazionale nei modi descritti in anticipo dai documenti della Commissione Trilateral, portando poi all'intuizione di un possibile “stragismo nero” e teoremi fasulli interni di complottismo per sviare lo sguardo daille loro prese di potere...

di cosa ci si deve preoccupare? :1. un intensificarsi di azioni stragiste.2. periodi d'impunità per organizzazi terroristiche già pronte (come ad esempio i salafiti che già hanno un santuario tranquillo in Europa, il Kosovo, e che nessuno inquieta, probabilmente perché si vuole che crescano indisturbati e che agiscano quando il Big Brother comanda (i salafiti sono quelli che il 15 aprile scorso assassinarono a Gaza il volontario italiano Vittorio Arrigoni nell'intento di far saltare l'accordo politico tra Anp e Hamas che non conviene a Tel Aviv).3. La distrazione dell'opinione pubblica con tanto di criminalizzazione per i nuovi capri espiatori...

ricordate una sola cosa, questi cani (senza offesi agli amici e fratelli  animali) hanno imparato molto bene una lezione fondamentale del potere....

If there is no will, all the assets are split amongst the children. 

The surviving husband/wife does not inheret anything in ownership, but he or she does inheret the right to use any of the assets (live in the house, collect rent on the house or collect intrests on the money inherited by the children). The children can't spend the money directly. They need the permission of their still living mother or father to use it.

A last thing to say is that most married couples live in a financial system where each owns his property from before he got married, but all the assets gained during the marriage are split 50/50 between husband and wife. So to determine the wealth of a married person at death, you take the total wealth of the household, deduct the previous ownership of the deceased and the surviving husband/wife, and then split it in two. At last you add again the previous ownership of the deceased. It is this result that will be split amongst the children.

Ouch - your description could match any one of about 2,000 different hotels, though I do love a good mystery. If you don't know the area maybe you can try to help us pin it down with some other information - the following information would be useful:

1) Close to the river?

2) On a big street or small (side?) street

3) Building style/colour

4) Close to the river?

5) Close to any landmarks or remarkable features?

6) Type of hotel? (Independently run or chain?)

7) Stand-alone dedicated building or typical ""Parisian street"" style

8) North/South/East/West of Paris

I think they mostly have stuff from large businesses instead of government agencies, but simply because government agencies keep their computer hardware much longer. If you really wanted to buy used stuff from government agencies you would probabely get first and second generation Pentium machines running Windows 95 or earlier. Though I doubt they sell the stuff, because handling is much more expensive than the current market value of these things. Note: I am joking a little. But only a little. Government usually has the olderst crap you would see anywhere.

It's definitely possible to come to Monaco by bike, I had several colleagues who did that. It's easier to park, but still difficult/expensive if you can't do it at your company. I guess you'll see there.

I just realized that I know nothing about US politics.

We can dismiss our parliament by just voting on it. We just need to think what we want to change, vote on it on a website and later it is passed to the parliament. Such radical decisions, like dismiss parliament, can be done only through president. We have presidents palace and can gather at it at any time we wan't and ask for it. No guarantees the president would have courage to do what people want, because bunch of people don't represent majority, and if more people will vote against dissolving parliament, the president loses his chair and parliament chooses new, more corrupt president. Like it did recently. This is last president to be elected from parliament, next president will have to be *upvoted* by people.

That's about all I could read. My grandma could probably read it just fine, but she's 400km away ;). Also there's lots of  abbreviations in there for which I can't provide a meaning. ""R.P.K."" could possibl mean ""Rehabilitation Psychisch Kranke"" or ""Rehabilitation for the mentally ill"". At least that's what a short google search gave for a more recent use of that.

Generally these include the spouse, children, and more rarely in some systems remoter relatives are included. The term for these people in English varies, since we don't have this concept in most English speaking countries (Scotland excluded). They include:

* obliged heirs
* compulsory heirs
* reserved heirs 
* forced heirs etc etc

In Scots law, which is based on Civil law, the system is (was? I don't know too much about Scots law) known as the legitim, and reserves portions for the spouse and children. The part that was due to the widow(er) was known as the widow's part, the part due to the children was known as the bairn's part, and the part able to be disposed by the deceased was the dead's part.

On a private level, English is ok in germany. (Stuff like Brot, Bitte, Milch, Danke will come)

2. The ""not too great"" market is perfect compared to USA, we have employee- rights here. We have the right to form unions, and these unions had 100 years to work for us. Also Germany looked solid during the ""crisis"" and now we actually have more new jobs than educated people.

3. English in psychology: this will be difficult! To be honest, if you dont have one special location where you can go or get lucky I don't see this happening. (but to be honest, i dont know those jobs)

4. Masters sometimes are in English in Germany (depends on course and univ.), this would be a possibility. To learn German, you will have to talk german. The americans I met, all talked English all day long, just cause people talked english to them. 

When they came back to my place, the first thing they said was:
please, i know you are friendly but i want to talk german, please

It's maybe interesting to know, that there is a difference between North, West, East and South Germany when it comes to the job-market and as well overall costs for living. 

* For example in Berlin (North-East Germany) you can manage to live a very very interesting and entertaining life in a big city on incredibly low costs (especially compared to other countries most popular cities). Rents are really affordable and everything else, too. I guess this would be a good place to start, as you really easily can have good time with a low-paid job and everyone speaks a decent English and can help you get slowly into German.

* The South of Germany is a bit different. Not really big cities except of Munich, but quite a number of islands of larger cities close to each other (Like p.e. Mannheim, Heidelberg, Karlsruhe which is called Metropolregion Rhein-Neckar). There you will have a great job-situation in general and besides a nice countryside very good living-standards. But of course, here you'd need some better paid-job to get by. Still most of the people speak English here, not at least because the Army Headquarters of Europe is located in Heidelberg (someone mentioned the job opportunities at army facilities before).

If I was you, I'd probably start up in Berlin and maybe after some time explore the south and jobs down there and see if you like it there, as well.
Also maybe check out international companies located in Germany. You'll recognize on their /jobs site if the corporate-language is English.

However, I don't think a BA in psychology is worth much if you don't follow up with a Master's, whether you're fluent in German or not. If you want to actually treat patients, then there is some additional training you will have to go through, so you should look into how this works in Germany if that's your desired career path.

As others have said, there are Master programs that are taught entirely in English, so you could try to get into one of those. Tuition is free or at least very low (if you use the course search [here](http://www.daad.de/deutschland/studienangebote/alle-studiengaenge/06541.en.html), be aware that the results may include private institutions, and they actually do have pretty high tuition fees).

As a citizen, you may be eligible for [financial aid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_loans_in_Germany), depending on your parents' income. You can supplement this with jobs, be it teaching English or working as a research assistant.

What you should be doing to prepare yourself is easy to answer -- learn German, that's a pretty useful skill over here. If you have the opportunity to get into an exchange program, that would obviously be a good idea. Not only would it help you with the language, it would also give you a better idea about life in Germany in general, which would be helpful when it's time to decide where to live/study.

Finally, if you can't get into a good Master program in Germany, you could consider other countries as well -- you have EU citizenship, so you only pay as much tuition as the locals, and there are several countries that offer programs in English and still have low tuition fees. Consider cost of living if you want to do that, though, it's often much higher than in Germany.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"There are several aspects to this. One is immigration in general, and the other is integration.

Integration is a big topic here in Germany, especially that of the population with a Turkish background. It's certainly true that there are issues with a subset of them, and I believe this is indeed of  socioeconomic origin, for which our school system is at least partially responsible.  
This gets amplified by two factors -- one is selective perception. The many who do in fact integrate aren't ""they"" anymore. That's the whole point of integration, isn't it? But of course the guy hanging out on a central square and acting aggressively is more noticeable than his cousin who is spending the time at work or later at home with his friends and family -- you know, ""except Ali from work, he's OK"". They are also easily identifiable, which makes it possible for stereotypes to develop. If their German equivalents all had red hair, people would develop stereotypes against gingers in no time.  
And that's the second factor, the stereotypes and resulting discrimination. Integration goes both ways, and selective perception is relevant here as well -- if you talk to dozens of people each day, and every other day one of them is hostile because of your background, guess which one you will remember. If you feel unwelcome and rejected, you stick with those who share your background, and become disenfranchised of the society around you. Which in turn amplifies the stereotypes …

Regarding immigration itself, I think the demographics speak for themselves. We need immigrants, there's no question about it. We should make it easier to immigrate, especially for highly skilled professionals, but also for the young and talented.

- Caltagirone is known for their pottery, and they also have some pretty interesting architecture (the most lauded is a decorated staircase that cuts up through the city)
- A trip up Etna is awesome, and the towns that ring it are good for short stops, too (Bronte &amp; Randazzo in particular; Bronte is known for their pistacchio gelato [delicious!], and Randazzo has a bunch of cool architecture)
- Floresta, north of Etna, is a gorgeous natural area
- Taormina &amp; Giardini Naxos are both very cool and lots of fun; also, Castelmora (above Taormina) would be worth the trip if you've got a little extra time.

I think you'll find that a lot of the time uneducated people from rural areas in Muslim-majority countries tend to be respectable and lovely while there (and also while in Europe, for many of them!)
I think one of the key issues with the ones who behave in a way that bothers natives is that they think they can get away with a lot more because Europe is oh so liberal about everything, and overdo it. What I've also seen with roommates is that they overcompensate in some way. Some behaviours like not teaching children about the *existence* of pigs because they are haram even if you're generally moderately religious tend to come out to pronounce the older generation's culture in a place that is culturally different. Similarly, for some people they try to live a life that's as un-Islamic as possible and end up being completely horrible. Violent drunks and such. I've lived with people like that.
So it *can* have to do with where they come from, but it's also important to realise that it isn't easy to be removed from your own culture and most of Europe doesn't have a lot of support to help with this problem.
I think it is important to find a balance between integration and support to keep one's own culture and the closest thing I've seen to a balance I liked was in the UK, although there was too little integration a lot of the time.

There are three problems with it. First, apparently the problem or perceived problem seems to be independent of whether the given country had colonies or not. Think Switzerland. Second, people don't feel responsible for stuff committed before they were born. Third, just because you say people shouldn't complain, they will, it is an ""is"" situation, not an ""ought"" situation.

I actually agree with this, if the refugee is granted asylum and commits a violent offence (either violent or sexual in nature) then they should be deported regardless of what they face at home.

By adopting this policy it reduces the argument of increased crime and drain on resources and promotes the idea of immigrants as a part of the community.

**España:**

* [El Método](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427582/) - Peli increíble sobre un asunto que podría resultar pesadísimo: una dinámica de grupo. Esta creo que sea la mejor sugerencia que te puedo dar, pues se trata de una película esencialmente de diálogo. Drama.

* [Los lunes al sol](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319769/)

* [Carne trémula](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118819/) - Clásico de Almodóvar. 

* [Mujeres al borde de un ataque de nervios](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095675/) - Otro Almodóvar.



** Chile: **

* [En la cama](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0474642/) - Otra maravillosa sugerencia que te puedo dar si te da igual sea la peli española o no sea. Sólo dos personajes, una pareja, en una cuarto de motel, que conversan - y descubren cosas uno sobre lo otro - mientras recuperan sus energías tras cada echada de polvico. ;) Tal vez la mejor peli de diálogo que ya he visto. Aviso: contiene escenas de sexo realistas y desnudez completa masculina y femenina.



**Argentina:**

Suelo decir que todas las pelis argentinas son buenísimas.

* [Palabras encadenadas](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0339489/) - Hace mucho tempo que vi esta, pero recuerdo que me gustó mucho. Es un suspense, otra peli de diálogo.

* [El mismo amor, la misma lluvia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0210843/)

* [Géminis](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0366544/) - Drama sobre incesto.

* [El aura](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420509/) - Crimen/thriller con Ricardo Darín. Pelis con Darín suelen ser muy buenas, todas ellas.

* [La niña santa](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0300270/) - Buena actuación de María Alche. Drama¿?

* [Whisky-Romeo-Zulu](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356487/) - Si te gusta la aviación no te puedes perder esta. Es sobre un desastre durante el despegue de un avión en BsAs hace unos años. Muy realista y muy bien hecha.

* [Mafalda](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309827/) - Largometraje hecho de una recopilación de viñetas animadas de Mafalda. Mafalda mola muchísimo, luego la peli también.

* [El perro](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420548/)

* [El secreto de sus ojos](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1305806/) - Esa es más reciente e fue un exitazo.

* [La libertad](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0291310/) - Muy poco movida, pero me encantó porque es un retrato muy fiel de la vida en el interior de Argentina.

* [Buenos Aires 100 kilómetros](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356446/) - Buen retrato de la vida en Argentina fuera de BsAs.

* [Plata quemada](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0227277/) - Otra con Darín, esta vez una policíaca. No te la pierdas.

* [Nueve Reinas](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247586/) - Y aún más Darín, otra vez una thriller de crimen.


**Uruguay:**

* [Whisky](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0331370/) - Comedia de esas un poco serias sobre dos hermanos.

* [Gigante](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1360866/) - Maravillosa comedia sobre un querer un tantico platónico de un chico a una chica que trabajan en un súper en Montevideo. ¿Quizá un cuento de hadas moderno? ¡Mírala!

* [El baño del Papa](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482901/) - Divertida comedia y un retrato fiel de la vida de la gente en la frontera Brasil-Uruguay.

* [Elsa y Fred](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0453047/) - Comedia romántica con una pareja de viejecitos. Una de ver junto a tu novia.

(¿se nota que me dan un gustico las comedias Uruguayas? :-)



**México:**

* [Y tu mamá también](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245574/) - Una relación entre dos ""chavos"" y una chica un poco más vieja. Interesante...

* [Amores perros](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245712/) - Muy buena, parte de la trilogía de la muerte de Iñarritú (pese a que las otras dos no sean en español). Contiene escenas fuertes de crueldad con animales, cuidado. 



**Colombia:**

* [PVC-1](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1031951/) - Thriller increíble rodado todo en una sólo secuencia, sin recortes. De verse sentado en el borde del sofá, sin darte cuenta de que no parpadeas hacen minutos. Una historia real, y muy triste, de esas que cambia a tu vida tras verla. 

* [María llena eres de gracia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390221/) - Basada en muchas historias reales. Chicas que trabajan de ""mulas"", es decir, llevando drogas a otros países. Drama triste.



** Estados Unidos: **

* [Che: part 1](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0892255/) - Cinebiografía de Che Guevara hecha por Steven Soderbergh. La recomendo mucho aun si no te guste nada Che.

* [Che: part 2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374569/) - Segunda parte de la misma.

Your thoughts? : 

&gt; ... the casual 'love ya! could also be translated as [Ich] hab dich lieb!. It's less strong of an expression as Ich liebe dich!, more casual in a cute way. It's what kids use to express their love to their parents (and vice versa), but it's also used casually among couples. There's no prober English equivalent (other than ""I love you"", which can have a more casual meaning than the German ""Ich liebe dich."" Maybe ""I hold you dear"" or ""I feel love for you.""). It's more than ""like"", but a bit less than ""liebe"" in the German usage.
&gt;
&gt; This could be used without the ""ich"":
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;she&gt; … hat ihn lieb!
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;he&gt; … hat sie lieb!
&gt;
&gt; Opinions, other native speakers?
&gt;
&gt; Edit: Sorry wrong grammar, if you want &lt;I&gt; instead of &lt;s/he&gt;:
&gt;
&gt; For her: &lt;Ich&gt; … hab' ihn lieb!
&gt;
&gt; For him: &lt;Ich&gt; … hab' sie lieb!
&gt;
&gt; The hab' should technically be habe, but hab' is what you would probably say. The ""hab"" is so common that you could even omit the apostrophe, it's often/usually written without. Personally, I'd use the &lt;s/he&gt; version, though.

Even *de facto* death sentences are legally and morally problematic in most European countries, but I can't say I don't understand the sentiment.

That's the claim, perhaps not as strongly put as that. ""More likely to have problems adjusting"", perhaps? The implication of course is ""scary black man will rape our women"" but most politicians are sophisticated enough to maintain at least some deniability against accusations of racism.

The weak argument part refers to calling the proponents of these type of policies ""selfish"" (or unfair or whatever), which I think is all that we're currently left with in this debate (when it comes to Finland and possibly Ireland and certain so far unnamed East European countries). I call this argument weak because, well, it's not going to convince anyone in a debate.

true,JrMint,FRAN,France,"I agree with the OP's overall point.  As an immigrant myself (immigrant in reverse - American living in France), from my point of view immigrants who are clearly marginalized are often like that for socioeconomic reasons. Unfortunately, in France so many of them tend to be Maghrebian and thus the stereotyping occurs based on race. However, I have met several immigrants from Tunisia who are hard-working and qualified. To be honest, them being Tunisian never entered my mind because they were educated. It was only after that they mentioned it that I thought, ""ah, he's an immigrant"". Because, indeed, I tend to stereotype immigrants as what I see in the streets myself like anyone else. (There's probably some German word to describe realizing one's own hypocrisies and being somewhat offended by them.)

I've also heard discussions around ME where people are talking about being tired of immigrants, how they're taking jobs from French people and how they should go home. My girlfriend (because frankly I don't care) piped up and said, ""so you think JrMint should go home?"" And then they say no, they're not talking about me. They're talking about ""them"", the unintegrated, uneducated. I've had this experience with somewhat young, ""enlightened"" French people as well as older generations in the North (Lille area) who (generalization ahead) tend to be more racist and macho.

When I go to do residency stuff, I am always the only white person there, the only ""French"" person. I think this always helps my case as an immigrant because of my background I'm not really suspect. I am privileged, whether or not it's warranted.

true,Britzer,GERM,Germany,"When talking about immigration there are at least three completely different topics that I can identify that have little or nothing to do with each other.

1. We need immigration in Europe. A lot. Our population is shrinking way too fast and we need a lot of people to supplement that. But that is no easy task, since nobody wants to move to Italy or Germany. We have a bad reputation. And don't pay enough money. Our language is difficult to learn and you can't get around on English. So the highly skilled, adaptable, modern elite goes to America and Canada and maybe Skandinavia. But not Germany or Italy. The countries hardest hit by the population shrinkage. I think the UN recently calculated that we need 200.000 or even 300.000 people a year coming **to** Germany. But currently there are more people leaving than coming. So from the migration standpoint we currently have a net loss. A little comment here: The way we treat students that come to Germany on a student visa and that *we* pay a lot of money to educate it is no wonder they leave IMHO. We actually want them to leave and don't give them resident visa after they spent five years or more studying and working here. No matter what they field is. Engineering, Computer Science, ... I kid you not. We throw those people out. Because apart from what the public might think we have very tough immigration laws and very tough immigration agencies.

2. Illegal immigration from Africa and Asia. This is completely different. These are highly motivated and eager to work people looking for opportunities who typically have low skills. Though we can certainly accomodate some of them (we need them on farms for example) I believe it would be better to have controlled immigration for low skilled jobs. Care for the elderly is a fast growing sector. We already have immigration programs for nurses, that cause a lot of problems for African countries, because they develope a shortage of nurses. A little comment here: First of all, there is a lot less illegal immigration than in the US and the problem is grossly overstated and a big problem in another way. A lot of people die in the Meditarranean Sea attempting to come to Europe, that is a humanitarian crises, though I have no idea how to solve it, maybe more controlled immigration from Africa would solve some of it. The biggest problem is that Europe causes a lot of instability in Africa. Young people don't see opportunities in those countries. So they seek them elsewhere. 
If we help create opportunities there, or simply stop destroying opportunties, they wouldn't come here. A little more fair trade, for example, and that problem would be greatly migitated IMHO.

3. Immigrants in Germany that have been here for a long time. The guest workers. They were never integrated, because they were expected to leave after working here for a decade or so. A lot of them didn't. And while I believe that problem is also overstated it currently is somewhat of a problem, indeed. But this is actually not an immigration problem, since there are no new guest workers arriving. Most of them have been here for decades, are born here and carry German passports.

Go to the Cathedral. Hard to miss the biggest gothic cathedral in the world (3rd biggest cathedral period). 

Like shopping? Hit up Calle Tetuan or Calle Sierpes for the best shops (not necessarily the best deals).

Visit the Alcázar, which is very close to the Cathedral. If you're a student it's free and it's a gorgeous arabic structure with unbelievable gardens, great spot to siesta in.

Also don't forget to check out Parque María Luisa and visit the Plaza de España (great to visit also if you like Star Wars, a scene was filmed there).

for bars... take your pick, honestly. Stay away from main streets if you want a little local culture, there's an amazing tapas bar on Calle Garcia Vinuesa, I forget the name of the bar, however. At Las Alamedas you'll find a slew of good cheap bars, if you like hippie neighborhoods. Los Remedios and Triana both offer some great bars as well (Calle Betis). If you like big clubs however: go to Cu de Tát. Crazy big bar, but I believe some nights it has a cover (includes a mixed drink, however).

For your breakfast, go to a bar/café and order tostada con tomate, that was always my favorite, or get tostada with whatever else you want on there.

Grab a litre of Cruzcampo (the beer of choice for all andalucíans), a packet of sunflower seeds and head down next to the river near the Puente de Triana for a great afternoon.

Also right next to the Puente de Triana is a churro stand. This churro stand is a MUST hit when you're out drunk at 4am.

Go to the Cathedral. Hard to miss the biggest gothic cathedral in the world (3rd biggest cathedral period). 

Like shopping? Hit up Calle Tetuan or Calle Sierpes for the best shops (not necessarily the best deals).

Visit the Alcázar, which is very close to the Cathedral. If you're a student it's free and it's a gorgeous arabic structure with unbelievable gardens, great spot to siesta in.

Also don't forget to check out Parque María Luisa and visit the Plaza de España (great to visit also if you like Star Wars, a scene was filmed there).

Secondly, apart from overt racism, there are the subtle prejudices, some of which are subconscious. Researchers have found for example that 9 in 10 white people take longer to identify pleasant words (such as peace and paradise) as ""good"" when associated with black rather than white faces (Anthony Greenwald et al, 1998). Keith Payne (2001) and Charles Judd et al. (2004) found that when primed with a black rather than a white face, people think guns. That's just scratching the surface.

Prejudices run deep in the human mind, and that's not likely to change, at least not in the near future. Creating a multicultural society without prejudices would take generations. Is it thus so strange if a homogenous society chooses to not accept immigrants? In his book ""Bowling Alone"", Robert Putnam explores the concept of social capital and how it is linked to flourishing societies.

Neapolitan is a very strict dialect (well, it depends on who's speaking it) and it might seems a very different language from italian, but it borrows a lot of things from spanish, so you'll see that some words will be similar. You won't have problems communicating in Italian anyway.

One of the safest areas, even at night, in my opinion is ""Vomero"" so I suggest you to hang out there if you don't mind moving from where you are located (I doubt you will find affordable accomodation there, though).

The main train station (Napoli Centrale - Piazza Garibaldi) and the surroundings are quite a bit dangerous - but it's a very populated area. As long as you keep an eye out you're going to be safe. Be wary of strangers approaching you or offering you good deals on items if you are walking in the streets around there.

&gt;Yet Breivik himself clearly saw his massacre as a political act, as the logical conclusion of the ideology he adhered to.

It's not that just he himself saw his massacre as the logical conclusion of the right ideology, it is its logical conclusion.

Firstly, reinforcing the otherness of immigrants makes them, in that worldview, a potential targets. They might not be presented as non-humans or even a-bit-less-humans, but are viewed as substantially different.

Secondly, the ""demographic warfare"", ""Europe under attack"" is nothing but the call for violence. After all, if they believe they are under genuine attack, it's unlikely they will ""turn the other cheek"". Both points clearly enable violence, both systemic non-physical and such bloody outbursts. 

That the targets here were not immigrants directly should not be surprising. If he wanted to wage a race war, whom he saw as ""traitors"" would be his victims, aided by the political polarisation. Also, integral to the right wing is the superiority of in-group. With that, it's conceivable he didn't think the immigrants have a potential to endanger ""his vision"" of Europe without ""white, civilised man"" guiding and aiding them.

Maybe the conclusions, left shouldn't get political points from this tragedy, holds. But the opposite doesn't. Extreme right, it seems obvious, should not just ""loose points"" but its bacis themes and rhetoric should loose much if not all of legitimacy in the public sphere. Not that some ban would be good, they are already careful to bury the real open hate-speech and calls to violence, but that the public should strive for the better understanding of its consequences and reject it.",0,1311747891,null,0,false,0,c2886ye,t3_j0wtc,t1_c2886ye,t3_j0wtc,1427398245,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Conosco molti Erasmus e dopo un breve periodo di ambientamento ti divertirai e farai un'esperienza unica. Napoli è una grande città, molto bella e divertente, scoprirai una cultura molto vivace ed interessante. è vero che ci sono delle zone pericolose in periferia, ma al centro storico puoi stare sicuro (basta essere solo un poco più attento). è vero che c'è il delinquente che cerca di rubare, ma la grande maggioranza della gente è onesta e ti darà una mano da subito e ti sarà amica. Per la lingua non preoccuparti: tutti parlano l'italiano, solo qualcuno tra i più anziani e i meno colti tendono a parlare in napoletano, ma il napoletano è facilmente comprensibile.

Finally, of course, left also had its share of lunatics. Both individual and collective, state and non-state actors. It goes for any extreme worldview.

However, this is only about A1 level, the lowest, which you should have after an estimated 75 hours. If you're not there yet, if it's required for you at all, you could easily manage that within the three months you're able to stay without a visa, anyway.

You will have a work permit, after three years your work and residence permit will become permanent.

You will *not* be eligible for social benefits during the first three months of your legal residency, or if your wife is financially able to cover your living expenses.
