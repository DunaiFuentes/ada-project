true,boq,BAVA,near Germany,"&gt; I understand that countries which promised to pay should pay according to defined rules. However, I also think if citizens won't vote about ESM being put in practice, they are ""promising"" something they don't want. I see it as forced policy from the side of the EU.

The EU consists of representative democracies. The citizens themselves don't need to vote for every single law to enact it, their representatives do. Quite willingly, if I may say, the EU can't and doesn't force them. I'm not even sure what you exactly refer to when you write ""EU"". The commission, the parliament?

&gt; It's unclear to me if money reserved for the ESM in one country could be used for something else while they are not needed or they are being fixed and prepared to be payed off. Nevertheless, if the country refuses to pay it will be punished. What if the country needs money in the same time, but has to pay to somebody else ? Here I would like to refer to the situation during EFSF crisis between Slovakia and Greece. Greece has twice the per capita income, and triple the level of the pensions than Slovakia. Why Slovakia doesn't get bailed out as well to be on the same level ? ESM will be good for big players, but not for small ones.

ESM members can do whatever they want with their money. In case the money is needed for the ESM, they can, for example, issue bonds to quickly get the needed funds without actually cutting national programmes. Though I agree that the situation with Slovakia is not exactly fair, but that's also why Greece is now doing a lot of austerity.

&gt; Another thing that bothers me is, that if country fails to pay, other countries will decide where the next package will go. So, if the same country fails to pay again it will be driven into more debt every time new call in authorised unpaid capital is made.

Members that need help from the ESM are not automatically without votes, only if they fail to pay back on time. That is, the time they negotiated beforehand. It's an incentive to make sure people are really paying their dues as promised. If Germany or France had lost their votes in 2002/2003 when they broke the stability rules, we most likely wouldn't be in this mess right now (imho).",0,1320077384,null,0,false,0,c2vvflf,t3_lu1c0,t1_c2vvflf,t1_c2vv5e8,1427808125,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

If this principle will be at the core of the new EU, then the weaker economy states will be quasi-colonies of the stronger economy states. Countries like Germany will always support the decisions best for them in the long run. If they have more power to support them, there will be a point where other countries will be sacrificed for the well being of Germany.

Even though the international media may indicate otherwise, the majority of the Greek population is not comprised of unionised civil servants, communist party members and protected trade groups.

It seems that you are looking for specific answers, given your loaded questions. Even though politically I'm a left-leaning moderate, I wouldn't blame this on capitalism. This is clearly a problem of corrupt socialist politicians (including the conservative party, which pretty much did the same and worse as PASOK the few years it was in office), who created a huge monster they couldn't feed anymore.

&gt; Also, why are you pissed at complaining civil servants? Are they considered unproductive?

Yes, most of them are. Before the crisis, they officially had 7 hour work days but you would rarely find them at work after 2 p.m. They got paid up to twice as much as corresponding private sector employees (who are lucky if they are allowed to work only 8 hours) and in general they don't really work hard when they actually stay in their offices. Ask any Greek if s/he ever had a nice experience with any kind of public sector service (hint:""NO""); services which are often required because of the ridiculous bureaucratic system. Their raises were automatic, based on the years they've been working, without their performance ever being formally evaluated. Their social insurance/retirement contributions went to a separate fund (not the IKA fund which all other workers must use) which was of course much more stable and future-proof, with higher retirements and better health care services, since it was only funded by the previously mentioned high public sector salaries, and it was never burdened with unemployment assistance since civil servants were never fired. Basically, the civil servants were a government-constructed upper-middle class, isolated from the ""unfortunate"" private sector workers. 

Notice that I use the past tense since many of these ""privileges"" are being cut.

&gt;  Who are the priviliged groups?

Various trade groups who had special treatment from the law that protected them from competition (AKA ""Closed professions""), such as:

* Pharmacists: Limited pharmacy permits issued; fixed prices with 30% guaranteed profits on anything they sell

* Taxi drivers: Limited permits issued, which were traded in the black market for absurd prices; were not even required to issue receipts for their services until last year

* Truck drivers: Similar to taxi drivers

* ... and more (the official government list had 136 ""closed professions"")

Together with crop failures at home the economy of Scotland was left heavily in debt and wiped out. England bailed out the Scots but at a heavy price - the Act of Union in 1707 and the end of Scotland as an independent nation.

Was this colonialism ? In one sense no - the Scots, after all, got themselves in the mess, just as the Greeks did today. But the price of their greed and stupidity (or rather that of their elites) then as now was inevitable loss of sovereignty - once the richer, bigger nation bails you out it the price is invariably fiscal and political union to ensure stability in future and protect its own investments.

By dumping the Euro and going back to the Drachma at an exchange rate of say (random rate) 5, would mean when they convert their debt to Drachma, they owe 5,000,000 Drachma. This is all OK and creditors wouldn't have a problem with this, as 5M Drachma is the same as 1M Euros, like how 50g of silver is the same as 1g of gold (or whatever the rate is these days).

Once they converted their debt though, through a myriad of central banking magic, they would 'poof' into 'existence' a stack of Drachma to 'pay' off the debt.

1) This is a type of credit default, as although you are paying back what is owed in terms of numbers on paper, the value of those numbers have decreased. People will find their life savings are worthless. Inflation will be through the roof, and people will find their income doesn't track inflation, so things fall out of everyone's price range. Spending 50,000 Drachma on imported petrol wouldn't be a problem if everyone was paid 50,000 Drachma an hour, but they won't be and never will be. 

Exports will become cheaper to foreign buyers, but thats fuck all good to Greece because they export the square-root of nothing beyond feta cheese. An export economy isn't going to spring up overnight to create value in their currancy.

2) With the default on their foreign loans still on their credit rating, Greece bonds will become toxic. No one is going to lend money to them. That means they can't finance whatever Keynsian hole-digging projects some Greek has dreamt up to boost employment. All their central bank will be able to do is lend money to itself from thin air and further fuel an inflatory spiral.

So no, saying they survived on the Drachma before isn't an applicable solution, as the Drachma of yesterday is in no way related to the Drachma of early 2012.
