And seeing at how bad things are turning out, perhaps there should come into existence some economic watchdog agency (*not* a rating bureau), which can warn and if needed intervene in a nation's monetary or fiscal policies should they deviate too much from what's considered acceptable. Some sort of 'safety car' feature as one often sees in races: As long as the road isn't cleared, everybody follows the safety car, once everything has been cleared, the race resumes.

true,Britzer,BERL,Berlin,"Wenn man sich ein bisschen mit Geschichte und Philosophie beschäftigt, dann kann man in der Tat den Eindruck bekommen, dass vieles schon einmal da war. 

Allerdings halte ich die aktuellen Politikprobleme eher für Probleme der Komplexität in Verbindung mit guter Lobbyarbeit. Durch den komplexen Alltag sind die Probleme, mit denen sich Politiker beschäftigen müssen ebenfalls viel komplexer geworden. Das ist auch eine Art Transparenzproblem. Eine Vorgang ist nicht nur intransparent, wenn er geheim gehalten wird, sondern auch intransparent, wenn er hinreichend komplex ist, dass kaum noch jemand versteht worum es geht.

60 Jahre BRD, 50 Jahre EU, und dann in der wissenschaftlich exakten Sprache der Juristen. Wer soll da noch durch die Gesetze und Verträge blicken? 

Und die Lobbys arbeiten sehr intelligent im Auftrag ihrer jeweiligen Industrien und überzeugen die Politiker, dass das, was sie nicht ganz durchblicken in Wirklichkeit 'gut für die Allgemeinheit' ist.

Das ging lange gut. Selbst die unverschämten Stromkonzerne waren zwar demokratieschädlich, aber haben unsere Staaten nicht bedroht. Die Finanzindustrie schafft es aber ganze Staaten zum Wanken zu bringen. Das ist von keiner Industrie oder Lobby eine organisierte Aktion. Das ergibt sich einfach, wenn Marktteilnehmer, die Eigeninteressen verfolgen, Einfluss auf den Gesetzgebungsprozess nehmen. Zu ihren Interessen. So lange die Leute noch alle Gesetze und Folgen verstehen, kann man Interessenpolitik noch leicht aufdecken.

Aber die Kombination von heutigen Lobbys (zehnmal so viele wie Politiker, an Universitäten ausgebildet um den Politiker zu erklären wie gut doch ihre Ideen sind) und der Komplexität verschiedener Sachverhalte ergeben eine brisante Mischung. 

Oben drauf dann noch der angeblich begrenzte Einfluss der Politik durch Globalisierung (der kleinste gemeinsame Nenner bei Umwelt- und Arbeitsschutz sowie Löhnen gewinnt) und wir haben ein ziemliches Problem, welches m.E. so noch nicht da war. 

Wir hatten halt noch nie so lange stabile Demokratien. Zeitgeschichtlich vielleicht schon, aber die Zeit läuft heute schneller.

Ich dachte immer, dass man einfach die Wissenschaft fragen könnte. Die weiß ja was objektiv vorteilhafter ist. Aber über Kooperationen und daraus folgenden ""Gefälligkeitsgutachten"" sind schon so viele Lehrstühle korrumpiert, dass ich das inzwischen auch als sehr kritisch sehen muss.

Die Welt muss einfach gemacht werden. Wir brauchen einen Erklärbär. Und je erfolgreicher der ist, desto mehr werden Lobbys an den Erklärungen mitschreiben.

&gt; Corruption: Corruption has become an issue of major political and economic significance for the Portuguese. The responsible authorities and many civic associations and think tanks are trying to combat corruption before it increases further. Many abusive lobbies and corruption schemes are related to concessions, unclear approvals to contractors and economic groups, or job creation for and commercial agreements with friends and family members, mainly involving the huge public sector and companies. Some cases are well known and were widely reported in the media, such as the affairs in several municipalities involving local town hall officials and businesspersons, as well as a number of politicians with wider responsibilities and power.[42][43] Notable criminal cases include the Face Oculta, the Oeiras Municipality Mayor Isaltino Morais scandal, the Apito Dourado and the Saco Azul de Felgueiras. According to the 2008 Corruption Perceptions Index of countries published by Transparency International, Portugal had the 32nd lowest level of corruption, out of 180 countries. In 2009 it had slumped to the 35th place.

Also [this link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index) puts you in 32nd close to Spain, which is significantly behind the better European nations. Granted  you're not as bad as Italy or Greece :)

The US has, recently as least, largely ignored Europe or taken advantage of its close relationship with some European states (UK-US relationship for example). Within a decade or two it will become increasingly evident to Americans that they cannot compete economically with a country more than four times more populous than theirs. As a result, American military presence around the world will be more subdued due to increased Chinese military investments. The US will want to balance China's power, particularly in Asia, as is happening now. As such, they will look toward their historical allies, most significantly Europe.

The EU has the upper hand in forging and defining a new relationship with the United States. It is far more populous, and is already a slightly largely economy. The growing sense of unity in the European continent could also rival American nationalism, though I would hope not. Nationalism is a terrible thing. The world is moving back toward an international paradigm of Great Powers, rather than Superpowers. Though Brazil, Russia, India, China, the US and the EU in the near future could be considered superpowers in their own right, the fact that they might all coexist as rich, powerful nations is antithetical to what a superpower is.

That's a generalization. I'll be the first to say that I wouldn't feel comfortable in the middle of them (but then again, I wouldn't be comfortable with Portuguese people from the 1700s), but to say that they all are zealots is just plain wrong.

Hopefully the Muslim world will mature and in the future keep their faith more to themselves. Obviously their attempts to Islamize Europe are doom to fail, we may be riddled with guilt but we're also filled with nationalism and patriotism for our country and continent that will fire up again if we feel threatened. And we know what happens when it does.

All in all, they're still human, and it's not difficult to understand their motivations. With time, they'll probably get past this and feel the same way about what lots of them are doing nowadays as we feel about what we did centuries ago.

true,melonpaste,PORT,Portugal,"Alright, well then you can't say that about Christians then. Because in theory, they are not suppose to kill (the Old Testament usually rambles about killing in Deuteronomy but that was pretty much for Jews at the time). Many things done by Christians were just made to gain power and butchered the meaning of Christianity. Just like the Spanish Inquisition. It was an attempt by the Catholic Church to give fair trials to those determined to be heretics by the **Spanish** authorities who claimed that they were against God, which was not true. It was simply a lust for power which turned into a myth about how the Church actually ordered killings of Jews, didn't happen like that. It just screwed up big time. 

The Qu'raan actually states, and still states, to kill unbelievers if you can't convert them. Christians are confused while Jews are stuck by the wrath of God. Mind you that in the Torah, there are also pretty ignorant things about non-believers. 

It is natural human behavior to lust for power.

Ganz einfach: es sterben immer noch tausende pro Jahr an multiresistenten Erregern.  [Solche Berichte stimmen mich ebenso nicht sonderlich hoffnungsfroh.](http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/medizin/0,1518,755575,00.html)  Ferner besteht das Problem, dass multiresistente Bakterien nicht an Grenzen halt machen, d.h. selbst wenn wir mustergültig das Problem in den Griff bekämen, sind wir darauf angewiesen, dass es in weniger entwickelten Ländern wie der Ukraine ebenso geschieht. Außerdem sollte vielleicht jetzt schon darüber nachdenken, wie man die Gesellschaft auf eine potenziell post-antibiotische Zeit vorbereiten kann.

&gt; &gt; Von ständiger Berichterstattung war nicht die Rede.
&gt;
&gt; Du hast doch bemängelt, das nur alle paar Monate mal etwas geschrieben wird?

Nein, habe ich nicht.  Ich habe nur gesagt, dass das nichts zur Lösung des Problems beiträgt.  Das Problem ist nicht das geringe Maß an Berichterstattung, sondern die Tatsache, dass der Fokus der öffentlichen Aufmerksamkeit primär durch die Berichterstattung geführt wird.  Dieser aus dem 19. Jahrhundert stammende Ansatz ist vollkommen ineffektiv geworden, und wir brauchen da echt neue Ansätze.  Wir haben die nötigen Werkzeuge (Computer, Internet), aber wir benutzen immer noch die alten Papier- und Bleistift-Ansätze.

&gt; Es ist Aufgabe des Arztes, auf Patienten einzuwirken und ihnen das Problem klarzumachen.

Das klingt nett auf dem Papier.  In der Praxis geht es so nicht: Ärzte werden nach Patientendurchsatz bezahlt, d.h. wenn sie sich die Zeit nehmen, Patienten aufzuklären, verlieren sie Geld (Systemfehler).  Außerdem prüft keiner, ob sie das auch wirklich tun.  Solange der Arzt keine Strafen befürchten muss, wenn er Patienten nicht aufklärt, liegt es an seinem guten Willen, ob er es tut.  Ferner bleibt das Problem von Migranten mit mangelhaften Sprachkenntnissen: ich kann mir nur schwer vorstellen, dass ein Arzt mit vollem Wartezimmer sich die Zeit nimmt, mit Händen und Füßen seinem Patienten klar zu machen, dass er die Packung Antibiotika auf jeden Fall vollständig aufbrauchen muss.  Und dann ist da noch der Patient: niemand überprüft ihn, dabei wäre es ggf. notwendig, Antibiotika unter Aufsicht einnehmen zu lassen.  Und Du sprichst ja auch das Problem der Tierzucht an, wo neulich die Erkenntnis kam, dass die [derzeitigen Grenzwerte viel zu hoch bemessen sind](http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/0,1518,791818,00.html).

Ich sehe schon, dass sich was tut, aber erstens hat es viel zu lange gedauert, und zweitens ist immer noch nicht klar, dass es letztlich Erfolg haben wird.

&gt; Eine Infektion mit so einem resistenten Keim ist auch nicht notwendigerweise eine schlimme Sache.

Noch ...  Und dann sind da noch Dinge wie Blinddarmoperationen, die in der Zukunft bei der falschen Darmflora auch gerne einmal wieder häufiger tödlich ausgehen können.

Wie dem auch sei: Du magst wegen Deines beruflichen Hintergrundes hier Fachkenntnisse haben, aber dafür fehlen Dir wahrscheinlich andere Kenntnisse, die nicht weniger wichtig sind.  Wusstest Du z.B., dass ähnliche Multiresistenzen bei Pestiziden und Herbiziden gibt, und dass, wenn sich dieses Problem erst einmal richtig ausbreitet, die Nahrungsmittelversorgung mehr als wackelig werden kann?  Solche Probleme gibt es hundertfach, ohne dass sich irgendjemand darum kümmert.  Und die, die nichts davon wissen, wiegen sich noch in trügerischer Sicherheit.

First of all, this is about legitimacy. Not just because it's the democratic thing to do to give somebody a choice between a rock and hard place (*much* harder), but because if it succeeds, any opposition, whether it's in the parliament or in the streets, will lose theirs. The opposition would lose the populist option, and could support the necessary measures in a productive manner because they ""respect the will of the people"". Things would get done much more quickly, and who knows, they might even contribute some good ideas.

People would have to inform themselves. Instead of reading reports of some fringe opinions that theorize how defaulting and getting out of the euro *might* actually be better, they'll read reports about what the *likely* consequences would be, and just how high that risk is. Again, less populism.

Many appear to mistakenly believe that the choice is between ""bad"" and ""bad, with loss of sovereignty"". Those aren't the same kind of ""bad"", though. To put it bluntly, when you're standing in shit the distinction whether it only reaches below your neck or above it is an important one.

Fuck it, you think that we Portuguese, Spanish or Italians just as bad as an entity that had some members shamelessly participating in corruption in such a way that lead to at least 8000M€ being loss? You think we citizens are also to blame for the fuck ups of another country because we also happen to be in economical difficulties? Do you realize how absurd it is to claim that, that ""Italy, Spain and Portugal are just as bad."" and present as evidence a copypaste from Wikipedia that says that ""Portugal had the 32nd lowest level of corruption, out of 180 countries. In 2009 it had slumped to the 35th place."" and provide examples about cases of corruption from bad referees? It's fucking insane!!!

When the EU starts losing members and we are set back a couple decades, surely, government fuck ups will be to blame, no doubt about that.

You might be referring to my other post where i was negative about giving this vote to people who are not properly informed, or educated (the stereotypical resident of a remote village, also a pensioner, a teenager, etc) and by which i stand by. I am Greek btw. And i would feel the same for any other nation, its nothing about intelligence - just information. Who knows exactly what all these agreements are?

 Secondly, i agree with everything you say in this post. I think in much the same way and share the same reluctant approval for the loan agreement, at this stage we've now reached. I can also do nothing but admire you saying that the people must be given the chance to get their say. Because that is the decent thing to do. I only have objections with regards to the timing. And i will add something more on this.

 The referendum now is much too late. If it had been held before the original memorandum, the PM could have got the legitimacy he is now seeking to continue or an order from the people to seek other alternatives. As we hear from the media and other politicians, there were options to achieve better terms for loan agreements from elsewhere (eg Russia), or we could have defaulted, or sold rights for oil and gas exploration as its suggested these resources exist in big amounts under Greece, or whatever other proposal would have come forward. By public order. It would still be a risk involving uninformed voters to decide but the stakes where smaller -although still very high- and there would be a lot of time to plan and for clear proposals to be made by all sides. 

 Now we're in a situation where we have already borrowed vast amounts of capital inflating the already huge debt and a default will be even worse than before - for all parties involved. And we are not alone in this. If we now as a country backtrade on what we've agreed on, it could spell disaster for the European project and we'll even get to be blamed for it. We're simultaneously affecting Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland  who are in the same path we are on more or less and if Greece, the 3% of European debt or so, defaulted early on they could still find their way out. If we default now i can only ssuppose it will be much more difficult. So it will be a disaster, possibly the end of the euro.

 And who wants the end of the euro? I tend to think not the majority of people in Greece (but it is in the interests of some protagonists of the corruption ""scene""). So in the end, with a referendum, the current government will get a clean sheet and find new legitimacy. Even if the people said yes only to keep the country in the European Monetary Union and not make an entire continent sink into further crisis, not to give support to a government that would lose an election before entering. There is your super populsit move. With a democratic due process giftwrap.

 I don't even want to go into what happens if the answer is no. Its possible we remain in the Eurozone. But not likely i think. The referendum question's wording will be crucial.

 Anyway there are so many things to be said, especially in areas a non-Greek wouldn't be familiar with, that i can't possibly fully expand my way of thinking here. But to add to the bit about the weird timing. The PM did two things today. One is this, the other is he scrapped ALL the top Army officials. In total 16 high ranking officers, including the top 4 in command. As if an international uproar and domestic upheaval wasn't enough for the day (This move and its causes and implications, as well as the timing obviously, are very highly criticised in Greece). But it had to be today for some reason. I can only speculate about why we must have panic of all sorts but i know an old saying that i trust and that is that panic is an ill advisor.

Anyway, they could have devalued their currency. This would still have had some negative effects, because practically everything with moving parts or a battery has to be imported and is priced in euros or dollars, so the average Greek would have had to work much longer to be able to afford, say, a new laptop or a car. Most clothes are imported, and so is oil. Everything would have gotten much more expensive.  
On the plus side, debt would have been reduced, relatively. Local services would have benefitted. You can't afford that new dress, but you can still go out for dinner, so you spend your money there instead. It also would have helped exports, although the problem here is that Greece doesn't have much of an export industry besides tourism.

When you have your own currency, you can just devalue it over night. Everybody would have a reduced income in practice so the country could become competitive again. It's not nice, but at least the pain is spread equally.  
If you don't have your own currency, then you have to get to the same point by reducing wages. This is what Greece is currently going through. Only, you can't simply proclaim that everybody will earn X% less from tomorrow on. Instead, this is a long and painful process that affects people to various degrees, and while their salaries get cut, their debt remains the same.

Now, if Greece would want to switch to a new drachma, it would enter unchartered territory, and there be dragons. It wouldn't help with debt. They'd still owe euros, and they would default, probably unorderly. Most of the Greek debt is owed to their own banks, so their entire financial system would be wiped out. There is no way their banks could survive such a hit, especially not after everybody would have moved their capital out of Greece to avoid the devaluation.  
Without a banking system and capital, companies can't get credit. This means no new machines, no increased production, no new jobs. Companies that rely on imports, be it services, components or raw materials, have the contracts with their suppliers in euros or dollars. They wouldn't be able to afford those, go bankrupt, and people would lose their jobs.   
This leaves direct investment from the outside, attracted by low wages. But would you invest in a country that is in total economic and social collapse, and where local suppliers that you'd have to rely on could be gone tomorrow? People would be very unhappy, and whether the political system could survive would be at least questionable. If you think austerity is bad, just imagine what would happen if Greece would be cut off from outside capital entirely and the government would be made to make do with only what it takes in through taxes in an economy in the state of collapse.

For Europe, this would raise some very tough questions. If it went really badly, we might even end up with a highly militarized failed state as a worst case scenario. However remote the possibility, to have something like this within the EU would be such an enormous threat that the other members wouldn't be willing to take the risk.  
Even if you disregard that, the exodus of especially young Greeks that would have to be expected would lead to social tensions in the other member states. Greece would almost certainly be made to exit the EU ""voluntarily"".

I know this reads like doom and gloom, but this is the risk. It doesn't have to become all that disastrous, but it would almost certainly be *very bad*, and you don't bet a whole country on a hunch that, who knows, it might actually turn out well.",0,1320187654,null,0,false,0,c2w8wsp,t3_lwdop,t1_c2w8wsp,t1_c2w6t7t,1427816072,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

Perhaps it's a particularly Scottish thing (I'd like to think so but I may be biased!) but I'd rather be poor and free than a bit less poor but not free.

Probably Europe (including the UK, we may not be in the Euro but we're closely tied to the fate of it) would be considerably poorer if the Euro was to bomb out, and that becomes very likely if Greece defaults... my preference would have been for a Greek default at the start of the bailouts. The problem is that now too far down the line to take that option and it is probably best to continue with the bailouts.

As for the Greek people being stupid I don't believe so. I don't really think that I thought you did either. I did take exception to you deriding farmers making decisions about economics but I answered that elsewhere so I won't go into it again.

Now that I do know you're Greek I do also want you to know I'm sympathetic.

You're dead right on the referendum. The Greek people should have been given the choice of the bailouts (and the implication that they should continue past the first if required) or no bailouts and accepting the bailouts would have been a very reasonable mandate to continue with them. 

The sad part of course is that the clock cannot be turned back. I would imagine the majority of people in Greece feel that a minority have abused the system and gotten rich and fat while Greece was part of the Euro and it isn't fair that everybody in Greece needs to suffer.

There is higher demand than usual for English teachers due to the recent requirements for students to have a B2 level by the senior year of University, (European Framework of Reference), and the general level of english here is not very good, so it only took me a month to find a job at a private academy as a salaried employee with social security, etc. teaching english and german.

with your multiple languages you're a good prospect for a private language school (there are many here) especially if you're willing to take over class times that other teachers won't (first class at 8am, last one could end at 10:15pm on a given day)

my approach to getting interviews was to email my CV to as many schools as possible (there are web services that do that for you). don't be afraid to call schools directly and possibly visit them if you know what area you want to be in.. big cities have more competition, but there are enough small towns with big universities where demand is higher.. i live in one of those, pay 170euros rent all inclusive and eat at the uni for 5 euros a meal, with enough left to save every month even with my modest salary

your cv is all right, employers don't even read it all, they just get the bottom line as long as you put a nice picture of yourself on it, and maybe rework some of the phrasing, and emphasize your language qualifications and teaching experience as a private tutor, etc (you could also take an online CELTA or TEFL course for teaching english or some other qualification)

Ignorance of what exactly? My euro scepticism is brought about because I rabidly object to Europe, I consider myself a eurosceptic because the entire project is run on insanity as the current debacle shows and also for the following reasons:

* The EU is very undemocratic, it takes too much power away from the citizens. 

* The laws are bent to suit political aims rather than sticking to the rule of law, or rule of treaty (see 3% budget deficit limits) 

* Several countries used creative accounting to get in to the eurozone and are now crying because they squandered billions and did not reform their own markets to be more competitve (see Club Med countries)

* Pathetic economic protectionism, mainly by the French but there are others as well, where Danone is cited as a strategic industry. 

* CAP - this is so wrong I don't know where to begin.

* The absurd migration from Brussells to Strasbourg of the Eu parliament only to keep the French happy. What a waste of 250 million.

The EU I would like to be a part of would offer something more than corrupt MEPs and inept bureaucrats in Brussells. Yes, the Uk has its problems but none of them will be solved by joining the eurozone or further integrating with the EU.

It has huge problems (especially financial problems, also because the ""Krankenkassen"" get fucked over by the overblown prices of medications) and currently this leads to a two-class medicine (huge differences between public patients and private patients) but it's still good that we have it.

2) 3) 4) Have been accurately answered by int_0x80 

5) If you search a bit you get really good doctors. It just depends. At some doctors you have to wait 1-3 hours without an appointment. My current doctor just wants a quick call before you come to his place and then they'll be prepared for you (or they tell you a time when to come. If it's urgent you can come immediately). In both cases my wait time is no longer than 20 minutes which is super awesome.
6) &amp; 7( See above. Same day for the general practitioner / family doctor. 
For specialists it really depends on the field he is practicing in. My dermatologist makes no appointments, you can come in any time but you mostly have to wait around 2 hours. (She takes a lot of time to talk to patients, so that's ok). 
Orthopedic for example is really bad if you want an appointment without having urgent needs. Sometimes you have to wait between 3 and 6 months (HORRIBLE). But most of these doctors have an hour in the mornings where you can come in without appointment or if you have pain and get treated immediately (1-2 hour wait)

8) Uhm? Just pick up the god damn phone and give em a call? :)

9) I'd like to see the pricings of medications regulated.

I admit I was wrong in my third point from above; this is very unlikely to happen. Still, I am just concerned about how these terrible and unacceptable acts of terrorism affect people's perception of religion and how this evolves into discrimination.

true,Bhima,ASTR,Austria,"A Financial Transaction Tax does not need to be very large to be effective.  It simply needs to be large enough dissuade trading for gambling’s sake but not so large it dissuades socially necessary business.
Naturally, it’s more effective to implement A Financial Transaction Tax  in a way that it is harmonized  across many markets.  However, it is possible to implement an excise tax on firms who do business in the economic area the FTT is operating in but do a majority of the speculative trading in a market with fewer regulations.  Additionally the effected markets can use the revenues of the excise tax to lower corporate tax such that the overall policy is revenue neutral.  In this way the vast majority of businesses will see no substantial advantage of fleeing the regulated market for a much more volatile unregulated one.  Though clearly some firms will increase their trading in such markets.

If the entire EU was to adopt a skillful FTT, the effect would be to shunt the most dangerous, volatile transactions towards other markets. Some the smaller markets in South America and East Asia are already intolerably volatile, so the most logical step for them when faced with incoming highly volatile speculators is to investigate harmonizing their regulations with more stable markets, which in turn makes the FTT more effective and benefits all of us.

Naturally there will always be markets who shun regulations in a bid to attract trading away from Europe.  Naturally there will always be firms who desire to speculate in frequent high frequency trading.  But this is no reason to prevent the EU from implementing a FTT (but it is a reason to put effort into making sure it is well designed and optimized).

As far as Sweden goes, my understanding of Sweden’s dealing with the last financial crisis is that while they were severely effected, they were less severely effected that less regulated markets.  Furthermore their response was more effective, created a softer landing, and a broader base for recovery than these less regulated markets.  Perhaps it’s not perfect to be out front with a FTT.  And perhaps the initial implementation in Sweden was not perfect.  But it’s clear to me that if the rest of Europe had pursued roughly similar policies around and following the collapse, the current debt crisis would be less severe and less urgent than it is today. Perhaps, given the strong need for reform in the PIIGS, that’s not an unqualified good thing… but that’s another discussion.

And yes, there were quite a few countries making money hand over fist just prior to collapse but it hardly does us any good if it starts a conflagration like what we experienced and most of that money vaporizes in a flash.

lastly I want to emphasize that I am not advocating for a punitive tax.  Nor the end of speculative trading.  Nor chasing 100% of speculators out of the European market.

Yes, and? So were Muslims. And newsflash for you: this isn't the Middle Ages. 

As for having decent conversations, I'm all for it but you've been spewing a lot of rubbish since the beginning of this one.

You have yet to provide a valid argument as to why Muslims should be treated differently than Christians with regards to humour and satire. 

You have yet to convince me that a non-religious country and a highly satirical (and with vitriolic humour) newspaper should not be able to mock a certain religion just because its followers don't have a sense of humour. Blasphemy is **not** reprehensible in French society, and hasn't been since 1905. The wild belief that so called ""islamophobia"" (that is to say in short: blasphemy against Islam) should be reprehensible is an aberration in itself. 

Equality in mockery is essential.

If I would like to convince you of something is that the problem with the criminals is not their religion, but their lack of education.

This is the thing, it's meant to provoke. The whole point is that the societies we live in say we can do things that provoke others verbally (so for instance, laugh at children who believe in invisible skylords) and they don't have the right to hurt us for it, they just have the right to laugh back at us. Provocation, yes, justification? No. That is the point.

&gt;I often ask myself if it's worth the four or five generations of marginalising religious belief and opinion in the public square for the slim chance of stamping it out, or if we should do more to encourage tolerance and build bridges.

Stamp it out. We're better off without the childish irrationality it brings.

&gt;My parents are Christian and they feel incredibly persecuted and marginalised by big atheist names.

To be honest, I don't give a fuck. You want to know what persecution is? Look up what the catholic church did to anyone who spoke against dogma. Hell, look at what happened to people who confessed to being atheists! Look at what still happens to them the world over. **That's** persecution. Being ridiculed for your beliefs being childish and irrational is not persecution, it's ridicule, and honestly it's probably one of the best ways to kill off religion.

OL has been more or less a feeder club of top talent for a while, usually a good mix of hardened veterans and up and coming players. For a while they were concerned with buying the best talent in the ligue 1 and then selling them on at a profit. 

They sort of shit the bed on Michel Bastos by letting him get to a questionable age where selling him will reap dividends, but he's still one of the best players at his position in the whole world. 

With the influx of money that the other teams are getting nowadays; they've dug a little deeper and are attempting to scout from the lower leagues. It's very much a business and you can spot former OL players all over the bigger leagues and not have too many hard feelings for them having left.

The last few years we had a pretty conservative coach who made for some less dynamic football, but the new guy is much more exciting tactically so we'll see.  Lyon has the best players in Ligue 1 if you were to match them all up by position, so having a more exciting coach is lending itself to more exciting play. 

We've also got Kim Kallstrom who is awesome, all the time, best utility player of all time.


As for games you want to catch OL vs. OM because at least one of the two games will be incredible for one reason or another.  Visually some of the stadiums will look amazing once the weather turns, particularly the stadiums at the coastal towns and the ones in the hills.  I'd say that Ligue 1 plays across a pretty broad variety of terrain that make the games always visually striking in the winter.  

A few years there's been distinct advantages to teams having bright yellow kits because of fog and whatnot.

* **AJ Auxerre** Very successful in the 90's with their manager Guy Roux. They are very irregular, as they would make it to the Champions League last year and almost avoid relegation the following season.

* **FC Girondins de Bordeaux** As stated, they are a pleasant team to watch, but they have been struggling to recover from Laurent Blanc and Yohann Gourcuff's departures, IMHO. Give them a couple more years.

*  **Stade Brestois** Team from Britanny, very strong identity and and pleasant old style stadium. Their main player Nolan Roux had an amazing season last year, he will probably leave for a big club soon.

* **SM Caen** Team from Normandy, playing good old dad's football. Their main players have been around for years now. Somehow they always manage to win the odd game against big teams.

* **Dijon FCO** Promoted this year, they stand their chance with good players like Jovial or Thil.

* **Evian TG** They went from National (3^rd division) to Ligue 1 in two seasons. They're a team Zidane and friends have invested in, managed a couple of good signings. Watch out for them.

* **Lille OSC** Current title holder, they lost Gervinho over the summer but with Hazard, Sow, Payet, Cole and good ol' Landreau in the goals, I wouldn't be surprised if they did something nice in the Champions League. Probably the best football display to watch.

* **Lorient** Very consistent team with their coach Christian Gourcuff. They always end around the 10^th place. Good philosophy of play and one of the best youth centres.

* **Olympique Lyonnais** A strong team with class and probably our best chance in the Champions League. Amazing players like Lopez, Bastos and Lloris. As stated, they have a renewed approach and practice a pleasant game. Title contenders, obviously.

* **Olympique de Marseille** Most popular team in France, incredibly strong fan base. IMO they somehow lack the character and the world-class players they need to hope for anything this season. Very poor start this year, and dreadful away strips.

* **Montpellier** Southern team, good stadium and a very effective stiker, Olivier Giroud. A bit inconsistent.

* **AS Nancy** Useless, rubbish. Somehow managed to avoid relegation year after year.

* **OGC Nice** Not much to be said either.

* **Paris SG** The new rich, loved and revered in Paris, hated pretty much anywhere else. Very good display, and for sure a title contender.

* **Stade Rennais** Team from Britanny, they are shooting for a Europe spot again. Very strong yet somehow frail in important games.

* **AS Saint-Etienne** Amazing history, as they made it to the C1's final in 1976 and very strong fan base. Lyon's historic rivals, they are the working class people's team. A couple of good players to watch for, like Rivière or Sinama-Pongolle. Hate them or love them.

* **Sochaux** Inconsistent, their midfielder Martin is the next best thing in the French media since he scored a double in his first game with the national team. One of the few remaining good team in the east of France.

* **Toulouse** Mid-table, not much to say about them.

* **Valenciennes** Lille's rival in the north, although nowhere as pleasant to watch and somehow playing in another league. They always managed to avoid the relegation zone in the end.

*Also, a couple of Ligue 2 team to watch for* : the old glories **Lens**, **Monaco** (though the are dangerously low right now) and **Stade de Reims** which stands a good chance to make it back the Ligue 1 for the first time since 1979. And, of course, **Le Havre AC**, who will be looking to open their new stadium next year with a return to the top flight.

So Papandreiou might think they'll sweeten up the deal to make the Greeks vote for it, or it'll almost surely be a ""no"".

IMO this is a slap in the face of all other Eurozone nations, to me it feels like Greece is saying: ""Yeah we fucked up, but we don't care, give us more time/money, or else we'll take you down with us"". Something that looks an awful lot like betrayal or blackmail.

Although I'm not so sure how the rest of Europe will react, or even whether Europe is willing to wait for Greece to vote on this. There wasn't any time left to begin with, so perhaps there are other exit scenarios. I don't think Greece is in any position to *demand* anything.

Opposition parties are all against the deals, but now that they are given the chance to end the new deal with the Troika, they chicken out (all opposition protested the referendum). A few examples: 

1. The communist party fights for an exit from EU since 1974. They now get their chance and they protest. 

2. The leading opposition party (which got Greece in EU in 1979 I think), is blaming the government for wanting a referendum, even though they have been against the deals with the Troika all along, and this is their chance to make their point shine in the minds of the people.

3. Some government members complain that ""their voice"" is not heard, and that they should not vote for the deals with Troika (even though they have done so, up to now)

Papandreaou could (in theory) disregard all personal and party interests, ""take one for the team"", vote the new deal and loose the next elections. If (in theory again) everyone would then STFU and go back to work, I would agree that a referendum is a bad idea.

And you don't accept the tinge of racism in all these comments here? Because it's there, and most of these conversations here have nothing to do with a bunch of idiots who firebombed a place to try and censor it. It's all about kicking out the Muslim ""threat""!

And there is and has been widespread anti-Catholic sentiment for years and years and years. OMG, please read about Protestant English history, and the way they treated Catholic Ireland and their vitriol against the French for their tyrannous religion (as they saw it).

And yeah you're right it's not nice, and I understand what point you're trying to put across and I'm not hurling abuse at you here.

from left to right the nationalities are: turkey, jugoslawia, russia, southern europe, non-native german and finally german, notice a pattern? turkish kids commit twice as much violent crime compared to german kids

and it has to do with cultural attitude heavily influenced by religion. i am a social worker, i work with these kids every day  so i can attest for this from years of personal experience. the biggest problem with the turkish people is a massive lack of respect for women, closely followed by a low tolerance for criticism of their culture and an unwillingness to learn the german language. 

its almost impossible to find a chinese immigrant thats lived here for more than 3 years who cant speak acceptable german, but you can find turkish immigrants whoms families have been living here for 3 generations who dont have the basic reading capabilities of a primary school kid.

So Europe would gain more control of wayward countries if their debt to GDP ratio became too troublesome:

*... In a letter to FDP members of parliament, Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle mentioned a few reforms. They include automatic sanctions for euro-zone members that violate budget deficit limits, which the Commission is to impose, and over which the member states would have no veto. In addition, the Commission and individual euro countries are to be allowed to file legal action against a country's budget at the European Court of Justice. A stability commissioner is to be given the power to withhold funds from the Structural Fund and Cohesion Fund if a country violates its obligations, limiting access to coveted EU subsidies. ...*

true,originalmaja,null,null,"&gt; 1) How do you feel about your health care system? I understand its the oldest universal healthcare in the world!

* I am happy that it exists. That I can afford it. But... I will not just be thankful: I will always demand for it to improve. If we stop demanding for it to become better, I believe, it will get worse and then disappear.

&gt; 2) What type of fees do you experience for being on the public health system?

* As a young student: I pay only a few bugs a month. 

&gt; 3) What are the Ups and Downs, so to speak, of choosing the private health insurance providers instead of the government?

* Depends on the situation. Depends on the service. Right now, I'm fine with gov-insurance; I don't mind to watch people with private insurance to get the better room, the earlier treatment... in the end, to me, private insurance mainly means: I would have to pay for everything in advance. And will it get back later from the insurance company (therefore: If I need an expensive surgery and I can't pay upfront... = problem).

A friend of mine is a German soldier. She is a single mother. Her kids's father is a German soldier as well. There is some sort of law that forbids it for the child to get public health insurance (because both parents are employed by the government...). So, financially, things are a bit difficult for her, since her child happens to need medical attention a bit more-often-than-usual... it's a bit ridiculous... she always needs cut expenses (often: in food), so that a the end of the month she has sth. left in case her kid needs to see a doctor...

&gt; 4) How often is that someone chooses the private sector over public?

* Don't know... Most people I know went to the same insurance company their parents did... (public). 

&gt; 5) How easy is it for you to see your general physician for a check up or if you have a cold?

* I walk across the street. I smile at the lady behind the desk. I present my card. And I wait ten minutes or half an hour... an hour max... 

&gt; 6) Can you see the doctor the same day or right after you make an appointment?

... Very much depends on what it's about. At an emergency... they have to treat you right away.

* Family medicine: yes, same day. or the next.
* ophthalmologist: can take month'.
* Otolaryngology: days.
* chest medicine: days, weeks (depends on the case)

&gt; 7) Do you typically make an appointment or do a walk-in? Which is more generally accepted?

* family meds... a cold n' such... i just walk in
* to see a specialist: appointment!

&gt; 8) How easy/hard is it for you to contact your physician?

* to make an appointment? phone call. to talk to the physician directly? = S/he usually has consultation hours (people can call in.. let's say... on wedneydays between 1 and 2 o'clock in the afternoon).

&gt; 9) After answering these questions, what changes do you wish to see in your healthcare system?

* I'd like more vaccination and vaccination campaigns to happen... I grew up in the former GDR. Every one (EVERY F***** ONE) got a letter each year of what vaccine to take (with the info where you can get it free)... no one in my generation (and neither my parents) got such nonsense like the measles or chickenpox or whatnot. Now it all comes back big time because vaccination campaigning does not happen so often anymore. Very frustrating. So many things have been achieved in the past to make sure the big diseases stay away, that people can grow very old... and, I guess, many believe that now to be the normal human condition.

Warum bei jeder nicht absolut notwendigen Verzögerung jeder Volkswirt vermutlichdie Hände über dem Kopf zusammen schlägt ist zum einen die Gefahr von einem Totalschaden.

Der sieht so aus dass sich die Meinung durchsetzt, Griechenlands Situation lässt sich unter aktuellen Bedingungen nicht lösen. Scheitern würde das nicht an der Finanzierung, die würde die Eurogruppe auf jeden Fall und letztlich in fast jeder Höhe bereitstellen (reines eigenes Interesse). Scheitern würde es wenn klar wird, dass die griechische Führung keinen Sanierungsplan durchsetzen kann, sei es parlamentarisch oder gegen die Strasse oder bei irgendeiner Erhebung von Volkes Meinung. Die Details von so einem Plan seien mal dahingestellt, wichtig ist nur, dass er einigermassen durchführbar erscheint.

Tritt dieser Fall ein müsste im Vorhinein ein klarer Plan B installiert sein und allen Beteiligten (also allen Regierungen der Welt, der Finanzbranche und zu einem gewissen grad jedem der ein Girokonto hat) kommuniziert sein und allgemein für gut und verlässlich befunden sein. Das wäre ein Mechanismus, der Griechenland aus dem Euro und der EU ausschließt und einen Großteil der griechischen Auslandsschulden sicher übernimmt.

Das ist allerdings Heute nicht der Fall, den nötigen Plan B gibt es noch nicht uuund *lufthol* daaaann bleiben nur irgendwelche Ad-Hoc Maßnahmen um die europäische und dann vermutlich weltweite Kernschmelze noch zu stoppen.


Die andre Seite sind Verluste durch Oppotunität, als Dinge die deswegen nicht passieren. Durch die entstehende Unsicherheit steigen Finanzierungskosten für alle, vom Staat, über den Multikonzern, übers kleine Handwerkerle bis zum Häuslebauer. Deswegen werden viele Investitionen nicht getätigt, viele Aufträge nicht vergeben, viele Leute nicht eingestellt usw. Die Effekte multiplizieren sich durch verschiedene Mechanismen an denen man nicht einfach was ändern kann und die Folge ist ein viel tieferer Abschwung, als er eigentlich sein müsste. 

Das sieht dann recht harmlos aus auf dem Papier, wenn nur deswegen unser Wachstum statt 1.5% nur 0.5% ... oder statt 0.0% dann -1% ist.

You mischaracterise the situation by not mentioning why Greece had to implement these austerity measures in the first place. For too long Greece has spent money it didn't have, mismanaged its government funding and robbed its own treasury. Instead of coming clean that things weren't up to standards, they decided it was probably better to falsify the statistics. 

And yet you claim it's the big bad EU's fault. The EU is *still* trying to help you out in this time of need. As a thank you, your dear Mr Papandreiou called for a referendum, which might nullify the whole effort.

Yes, and playing this kind of politics in a situation like this pisses me off. They also proposed a unity government under the condition that Papandreou stepped down, until he said he would be willing to pull through with that.

The damage they could do to the rest of the Eurozone, the EU, and even countries well beyond that, is enormous. But the effect would definitely not be *larger* than that on Greece. This would hardly be possible.

I agree there would be political consequences if it came to that. Personally, I'd want them out of the EU, not just the Eurozone. The EU might even not have much of a choice, because there'd be a real risk of Greece turning into a failed state.

&gt;Vorgesehen ist, dass diese Umschuldung im Januar durch einen Tausch der vorhandenen Staatsanleihen gegen neue Anleihen mit einem Abschlag von 50 Prozent organisiert wird. [...] Die Details müssen noch ausgehandelt werden. 

&gt; Zusätzlich wurde vereinbart, dass Griechenland im Rahmen des zweiten Rettungspakets bis 2014 etwa 100 Milliarden Euro an Mitteln der öffentlichen Geldgeber erhält. Das genaue Programm soll bis Ende Dezember ausgearbeitet sein. [Quelle](http://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/gipfelbeschluesse102.html)

D.h. bis Januar passiert so oder so nichts und Gelder wären auch erstmal nicht sofort geflossen. Soooo eilig ist das alles also nicht.

Der versprochene Schuldenschnitt ist ja auch gar keiner:
1. Private Schuldner sollen /festhalten/ *freiwillig* auf 50% verzichten, niemand muss dem zustimmen. Deshalb heisst das Ding auch offiziell Umschuldung und muss mit Garantien des Rettungsschirms abgesichert werden. 
2. Die staatlichen Gläubiger (hauptsächlich Deutschland, Frankreich, USA) und die Europäische Zentralbank verzichten auf gar nichts.

Die bereits beschlossenen Sparmaßnahmen in Griechenland z.B. im Gesundheitswesen sind ja schon sehr hart. Welche Konditionen nun gestellt wurden habe ich nicht gefunden. Es ist nur von weiteren Privatisierungen die Rede und:
&gt; Die Beschlüsse sind jedoch an weitere harte Sparmaßnahmen geknüpft.

Dass Papandreou diesmal sogar seine Bürger befragen will spricht für mich Bände. Auch wenn ja noch nicht mal klar ist über **was** eigentlich abgestimmt werden soll.

Sorry, über Geld aus möglicherweise entgangenen Gewinn durch kleineres Wachstum oder gar Schrumpfung möchte ich solange nicht  reden, solange Spekulationen auf einen Abschwung legal sind.

Ich weiss nicht genau wie den Personen zu helfen ist, die für ihr Handeln vermeintlich verlässlich die Zukunft kennen müssen. *So kann isch abe ned arbeide?* Die Verzögerungen sind offensichtlich notwendig, ob das Volkswirten passt oder nicht. 

So mal prinzipiell: Kreditvergabe ist kein Solidargeschäft. Der Kreditgeber erwartet zurecht einen Gewinn, geht aber das Risiko eines Verlustes ein. Griechenland hat sich überschuldet und ist nun pleite (Im Übrigen nicht nur selbstverschuldet). Das Geld ist weg. Die Finanzmärkte z.B. wissen das und haben den Verlust längst eingepreist.

Die EU dagegen ist eine Solidargemeinschaft und kann/will Griechenland nicht pleite gehen lassen, deshalb mache ich mir auch keine Sorge um eine -wie du so schön sagst- Kernschmelze (das Geld um Griechenland von heute auf morgen zu entschulden liegt übrigens bereits in notwendiger Höhe im Rettungsschirm EFSF). Die Gemeinschaft muss sogar deshalb helfen, weil Staaten ihre Verschuldung sonst über ihre Zentralbanken refinanziert haben. Das kann Griechenland (Verschuldung 140%BIP) nicht, weil es Mitglied ist. Japan mit 200%BIP wird z.B. nicht die Bonität abgesprochen.

Ich möchte die griechische Regierung nicht in Schutz nehmen, sehr wohl aber die griechische Bevölkerung. 

PS: Der um unser BIP besorgte Volkswirt hat sich übrigens bereits 2008 den Kopf selbst eingeschlagen als im Euro-Raum bei der Bankenrettung 212 Mrd. direkt an den Bankensektor gezahlt wurde. Das genehmigte Beihilfevolumen lag sogar bei 3,36 Billionen Euro. Und da waren keine Rentner, Kinder und Menschen wie du und ich beteiligt, die jetzt um ihre Lebensgrundlage/-bedingungen von morgen bangen müssen.

Phänomen and Erscheinung are words that can be used for many things. They don't have to be related but they can be.

Phänomen (Whole Experience/Occurence)
Erscheinung (Visible Aspect)

And that is the reason I call [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/lxfzl/french_satirical_magazine_charlie_hebdo_have_been/c2wjfw6) by you racist as well *persons who find European freedoms such as; freedom of speech, sex equality and freedom of religion somehow wrong, should seriously ask themselves why they live there*, because it implies that you mean a larger group of people. Like all muslims, but are simply not saying it. For pc reasons. That's the thin veil I was talking about.

And again, I am certainly not the only one who gets things like this wrong. That's why you shouldn't make such statements in a racist thread like this one.

true,cbfw86,UKGB,"Class clown, est. 1985","Just because you respect and tolerate the presence of an opinion in the public square doesn't mean that it has to be listened to. You can share culture and perspective without subscribing to it.

Take Flat Earthers, for example. They have their clubs, that've had coverage on the BBC website, they have their conspiracy theories, but that doesn't mean they need to be mocked and ridiculed. There's nothing wrong with a simple, ""Well I disagree. Here's why. All the best, take good care,"" and be done with it. To treat them in the way that religion is treated would be to say, ""You are a moron and should be sectioned. Look at these dates of when the globe was circumnavigated. Look at this mathematics and physics relating to gravity and the Solar System. Look at this evidence from outer space. Look at this, look at that. You're a dumbass. Hey look at this picture I drew of your flat earth. Is Gaia with no breasts. Get it? My flat-earth, I am hysterical. Come on let's organise a debate and televise it. In the mean [getting tired yet?] time I'm going to write this book and get my friends to do the same. Then I'll make a tour of your community and make a documentary like you're all some sort of lesser species and make you feel uncomfortable in your own society.""

If you think I laboured the point there then it means I made my point. That's how much crap religious people have to put up with. And they get tired and they get sick of it. When their opinions and beliefs are marginalised through mockery they're only going to get more upset and extreme. And then they try and participate and they're forced out and the spiral repeats. What 'rock bottom' is in this scenario I dread to think, but at present we seem set to hit it.

My point isn't to say that religion should be left to run rampant. My point is that if warring in the Middle East creates insurgency over there then warring with their beliefs through immature means only creates insurgency in our own back yard. I think there is an intelligent means to reducing the influence religion has on young minds but showing yourself to be an infidel and proving the crazy cleric right only makes kids think that torching Charlie Hebdo is a good idea.

I don't think Charlie Hebdo 'deserved it', I don't think 'they had it coming'. I DO think that they provoked it. I DO think that provocation burns bridges rather than builds them for young minds to cross. I CERTAINLY think that the cost:benefit ratio of the current efforts of many atheists is worse than it could be and that current methods will never eradicate religion. Ultimately people are always going to seek moral and existential truth and come to different conclusions. We should be respectful of that and the good parts of the culture that religion brings to people's lives. That's the respecting without listening that I'm talking about.

They tools are there to free young minds of the shackles of oppression (Charter for Human Rights, science, education, empathy, reason, fellowship, etc.) but mockery is not - and never will be - one of them (no matter what Sam Harris says).",0,1320317560,null,0,false,0,c2wotho,t3_lxfzl,t1_c2wotho,t1_c2wofh9,1427823710,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Je ne sais pas comment ça se passe dans le monde du journalisme et l'édition, mais ils ont peut-être un service com/marketing (l'édition) qui n'adhère pas forcément à ce point précis de la ligne d'idée de CH (les journalistes).

&gt; Heres the thing. theres a lot to see.

where ever you are, you can get to sol quickly by taking the cercanias. it will leave you in sol in 5-10 minutes from both main train stations (chanmartin and atocha).

now from sol you should check out all the old streets behind it. plaza mayor.

Going from plaza mayor in the direction of the opera metro station you will reach the san miguel food market which is expencive but very nice. if you continue in the same direction (check google maps) you should reach the royal theater and opera house. a bit further in that direction you should reach plaza de oriente. the sabatini gardens and camo del moro which are all very nice.

Then get your ass in the metro (it functions untill 2am but the last trains leave at around 1:30 from the start of the lines) and you can either take opera or principe pio.

If you take opera take it in direccion of las rosas and get off at retiro. that should leave you next to the retiro (do NOT go in at night). check out the park a bit. has the only official monument to the devil that i know of (monumento al angel caido). then go down alcala untill you reach the castellana.

The 27 bus is a normal line bus (not a tourist bus, but it should be). it travels between atocha and plaza castilla. and the main benefit is that it allows you to see the entire castella with everything on it for a 1.50€. meaning that it passes next to museo del prado. the old central post office (which is also the new city hall). plaza colon. the santiago bernabeu soccer stadium. cibeles. nuevos ministerios. and other madrid landmarks. i suggest you check out this link http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%ADnea_27_%28EMT_Madrid%29

and compare it against google maps to see where you should take the bus to get the best effect. if you take it near alcala you might miss some stuff.

Another leg of the tour if you have time should be before going to sol you can go to alonso martinez and go down to barquillo. then plaza de chueca (gay district of madrid, which btw, theres an excelent ice cream shop on the plaza called bonata). visit the san anton food market which was just renovated and then take the small streets up to fuencarral which is a nice walking street with avangard shops mixed with alternative culture (but beware of the transvestite hookers at night), you should be aware that if its a weekend and evening chueca is going to be packed so going tribunal gran via from alonso would be a wiser choice.

Once on gran via you can access sol through montera which is famous for its hookers (look but dont touch). or you can walk up gran via and enter by callao which is a classical comercial district. theres a half decent ramen place crossing the street from calao but thats another issue. walking down callao where the fnac and corte ingles is you should reach sol.

Feel free to make questions.

From all of that. i do recommend that the most priority should be put in the sol-opera-campo del moro leg.

And you should atleast ride the 27 for a bit, a 10 ride pass costs 9,30€, beware of pickpockets and romian gypsys (it sounds a bit racist but they are responsible for around 85% of the street crime right now).

sometimes they will have you look at a map while the partner is coming for your wallet from behind and sometimes they will just shove their hand in to your pocket or bags if they see you´re a tourist. so travel light and try to travel with a phone, cash/cards and ID in a place you can control it and with as little bags on you as possible.

But it seems like the referendum is not going to go ahead as planned. Or will it? Not really sure anymore. If it doesn't and the deal is approved then Greece is gonna face some severe rioting. And at that point, I am no longer sure if they will be able to manage it anymore. 

The key problem as I see it, besides the whole mismanaged economy, is that Greece cannot solve its problems in the traditional way through currency controls, but at the same time it is sovereign so there isn't a central above government (the EU government is still too weak) to create an economic plan to get Greece out of it. And it too can't enact currency controls because of the potential of damaging strong economies such as Germany. So the issue is a sovereign state without control over its currency.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Well, *that you hadn't heard of this aside*, I'm not sure if this is the ideal topic. On the one hand, it really is an interesting and very long going development, but on the other, it's also extremely complex, it touches many economic issues even experts don't always agree on, there's a lot of misinformation, populism and many conspiracy theories floating around, it's developing very quickly and is difficult to stay on top of even if you already know the history behind it and the specifics of the involved countries. Also, it's kinda the obvious choice, so your paper would be easy to compare to that of your classmates and your professor might grow tired of the topic.

If you decide to go for it, may I suggest you focus on a specific aspect of it? For example, you could analyze it from the perspective of the UK, France or Germany. The UK isn't part of the Eurozone and generally pretty EU-skeptic. Germany would be interesting, because you could go back to the Weimar Hyperinflation, which still shapes German attitudes towards central banking.

In any case, you should read the [Schuman Declaration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuman_Declaration). In the end, this is what it's all about, making another war impossible through economic entanglement.
