There are currently 400 investigative procedures pending against EU officials. The Commission claims that corruption is no more widespread in Brussels than anywhere else, but the budget expert for the German CDU in the European Parliament, Inge Grassle, describes this view as ""laughable"". The magazine quotes UK MEP Daniel Hannan as saying ""If the European Commission were a company, all the commissioners would be in prison"". All Commissions since 1999 (when Jaques Santer's team all resigned over corruption) have promised to fight corrupton, and all have failed. The present anti-corruption commissioner, Siim Kallas, was himself embroiled in a major financial scandal in the 1990's (at least he has practical experience). Even the Commission admits that 320 euros have been stolen - nearly 1 million per day. The true figure is probably much higher - see below.

It baffles me when I see this argument being used in the US, it baffles me doubly more so when it comes across to Europe.  It's an argument that should have died a death from common sense a long time ago.

China's mass manufacture is different to Europe's specialised manufacture.  It might make it more competitive but it would be negligible; not if Europe wants to keep social provision and worker and consumer rights.  For production costs to approach what would be even a remotely level playing field all hell would have to break loose first; you just have to look at the purchasing power parity of Chinese wages and their average earnings.  Most Chinese salaries equate to a couple of thousand US dollars a year.  If Europe even approaches the experiment is over.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"I think that in many troubled nations there is great need to have a general discussion on how people expect the society to work - on how peoples as a group function, but also as how individuals work, and what the rights but also obligations of people are.

Some of topics that come out of my are...

* Responsibilities of different generations... Is it right that generations now in 50s and 60s get greater pensions than younger generations will get, even thought younger generations pay the pensions of older generations. This is an issue that involves most European countries as only few countries have fully funded pension funds, and most rely on the next generation to pay out the generation before.
* Do bribery and nepotism belong to the culture, to the way things are done, or are they judged to be corruption and heavy punishments used to force people to obey rules: for an example bribery of official leading to automatic prison sentences and nepotism to employer having right to cancel the work relationship at will...
* Does the society want to be meritocratic, and if so, how much freedom it gives and how much wealth it allows its more successful members to accumulate? This also includes economic freedom, freedom to start companies easily, freedom as an employer to hire and fire at will, etc...

The reason why I'm wondering about these topics is because it amazes me that there are still many people in that believe to socialism or even communism that want to nationalize industries and shut down free markets. Didn't they see what happened in the USSR? Haven't they read Weber with their Marx? Are they totally oblivious to the lessons learned in the last 100 years from both the capitalistic and socialist countries. Or people who say that doing inefficient things such as bribery or nepotism belong to their culture, and even that it is the right way to do things.

I just feel that in many countries there should be more conversation about these topics. In my country during the beginning of 90s when our economic bubble collapsed and when at the same time USSR collapsed, there was a cultural change that moved this country to be more entrepreneur friendly, more market orientated, and people finally started to took corruption seriously.",0,1324318739,null,0,false,0,c39enso,t3_nih2r,t1_c39enso,t3_nih2r,1428045147,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

A strong currency is nice, because it helps people buy goods cheaply off the world market. 

However, honestly, I think that for a country's long term economic health, a weak currency is a boon - because it forces a nation to rely on its own resourcefulness to create an elaborate and robust economy. Also, it makes the place attractive to foreign investors. When a country is so heavily reliant on a single foreign country like China as a backstop for its own standard of living, I think it can easily fall into complacency. It's not a sustainable situation, and eventually there will be a painful economic correction, which people may not be prepared for.

WHAT ARE YOU BLATHERING ABOUT, WOMAN?

&gt;but a lot of sudden insights start to crystallise when we start looking at things as they occur in the real world. 

Which is why I just gave you links...

&gt;If you're not willing to look with a fair mind and in detail at Argentina or Iceland as examples of Western economies 


I did.  Iceland in its entirety has a population the size of Europe's 90th biggest city.  The idea that what works in geothermal Iceland would work elsewhere is preposterous.  It is in a unique situation.

When you look at Argentina the only lessons to be learned there are precisely what the pitfalls are.  24% inflation, they've had to bring in other countries to print their money because their own presses can't keep up.  Any savings, any capital, is spindling through a time-glass.     

They're barely treading water.

&gt;what countries are you willing to look at with me?

Well if you're trying to establish a working model try finding a country whose currency isn't in the last death spiral before going down a pan (rules out Argentina) or one that could in a 1000 years be replicated (rules out Iceland).

&gt;However nations like China, the UK, Japan, and Germany are really hard-working places. I don't think that you folks in the British Isles have anything to fear at all from a weak currency.

Simply could not afford to feed the car if oil is going to continue being priced in dollars...for a start.  Britain is technology and high end manufacture, cheap currency doesn't come into.  I'll tell you what will happen though, other than there being a lot less cars on the road, the cost of living would go up and purchasing parity would go down.  I don't need to speculate to know what would happen there.  There are plenty of examples to light the way...

That was the case mainly in the USA and in some European countries. However strong market economy countries such as Germany, Netherlands, Sweden and Finland have fared quite well. Having an market economy doesn't imply that there are no regulations.

If we then look at Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece where there have been huge construction and property booms, the failure of the governments of these countries where not to decrease public spending heavily in boom years to cool down the economy from overheating.

I answered that by replying ""It's an argument that should have died a death from common sense a long time ago.""  There is no reason to the point you made. If you think a society that's used to a high standard of living is going to be happy competing with China by living on the sort of salaries they do, to the standards they do then reason has left the building.  Europe has to drop a loooong way to reach competitiveness with Chinese or East Asian mass production.

One which was completely impractical because it could never be replicated, and one where the country is being crippled by rapidly rising living costs year on year.

&gt; I mentioned that the country has a stronger exporting power. This is a fact.

And I AGREED!

I just looked at the other side of your point.  You said firms with a weaker currency find it easier to sell stuff to those with stronger currencies.  I said yes, and that means the people with the stronger currencies are able to buy more stuff because it costs them less!

&gt;b) Tourists do visit the same place more than once. Millions of tourists visit Great Britain each year. Those people will spend more because their currency can buy more. Same consequence as above : The economy grows

And I AGREED.

I just looked at the other side of your point.  If you ask me whether I'd rather be serving tourists or be a tourist being served on I'll take the latter thank you very much.  And if I come from a land with a strong currency then guess what?  I get cheaper holidays!!!  Again, I agree with your point but I'd far rather be the one with the stronger currency.

&gt;c) Buying power =/= strong currency. The foreign capital invests. 

And I AGREED but buying power most certainly does come with having a stronger currency over a weaker one.  That's why ""foreign capital invests.""  Again, you're probably spotting the pattern here, I just saw it from the other side and said I'd rather be the investor than the invested.  There's more money in it.

&gt;This makes no sense. You will retire in the USA and you will pay taxes and spend your hard earned pounds to buy products. Oh, you will also buy a house, right ? Welcome to America (btw i am not an american).

If the USD is the currency that's weak then the entire country is bankrupt because nobody is using it as their reserve currency anymore.  

Oh damn right internationals would move to mop up after the riots died down.  Yes they would buy homes and pay taxes but foreign investors would have a lot more buying power if converting from a strong to a weaker currency.  It wouldn't be good for Americans though, the markets would become artificially inflated to capitalise the most on the foreign investors, leaving Americans out in the cold.

&gt;  ""If the Euro loses value significantly, it'll make European manufacturing more competitive with powerhouses like China.""

I never asserted that the Euro would lose value to the point that Europeans are earning the equivalent of the average Chinese wage of $250us a month. I don't think the Euro would ever drop that far. That was your exaggeration you dreamed up because it was convenient for your way of creating an argument. You do love being dramatic, don't you?

I've lived just above the poverty line in the USA my entire life. I'm quite happy at that income level. As far as life in a country which is experiencing rapid inflation goes - of course, it would be hard. Nothwithstanding that, it also means that the value of loans taken out to buy homes, land, or anything else are effectively cut rapidly as well - in other words, debt relief happens.

&gt; Incidentally Britain's actually been there before. It was in the late 1970s. Guess what? Not. A. Good. Time.

Many Western countries were suffering the same malaise in the 1970s, including us across the pond in the USA.

&gt; I'm not angry at all with you. I'm ridiculing a stupid argument often seen and made in reference to the US. It's the first time I've seen it made in regards to the EU.

Germans very commonly make the argument that their economy is healthy exactly because the common currency keeps the valuation of the Euro relatively low. It's also a common argument made in Canada and New Zealand. People speak about the benefit of keeping their currency valued low to improve economic health and make their exports more desirable. I believe one would also hear a similar sentiment spoken in the halls of the Japanese Diet from time to time.

Christ, so that's why this silly US rhetoric is being squeezed into a European context.

With regards you living ""just above the poverty line"" you just said that in response to 15-20% wage reduction year on year.  How this didn't sink in as you typed it I don't know... if you had a 15-20% wage reduction year on year you wouldn't be just above the poverty line.

LaGarde is a fool.   In 2007, I nearly fell over when I heard her say on tele,

""This won't affect France much because France doesn't do so much business with America.""

A couple of years ago, there were fuel protests in France.  A few hours before the pumps ran dry LaGarde said,

""There will be no shortages.""

In the calm before this part of the storm Lagarde was swanning around saying France is fine because French banks benefit from better regulation than everyone else.

And Lagarde is just another French replacement for some other French dude who responded to this crisis by getting caught stiffing one of his researchers or whatever even before the chambermaid.

And apparently, this plan of LaGarde's is illegal in German law, to say nothing of anyone else's law or the ECB mandate and it's just total crap.

I saying that personally would far prefer being the tourist, and being able to afford to be a tourist, than servicing the tourist.  Of course I'd prefer it if travel was affordable as opposed to not.  If that's not self-demonstrative then I don't know what is.

Ask someone if they'd rather have their country, and companies in it, investing in other countries and buying profitable businesses, resources or whether they'd prefer foreign nationals to be buying and owning companies that traditionally belonged to them.  If you'd rather be bought than be the buyer then that's your choice - you're not proving anything to me either.

It is a symbiotic relationship, you're just arguing you'd rather be the weaker one who competes for the wealth of others (foreign capital).  Fine, I'd rather have the wealth and the choice.

&gt;But you don't mention where you get this money from. You earn it by working in your country. 

And I'm going to go with, where countries with strong currencies currently get their money.  I'm also going to remind you that as your foreign investor, with the strong currency, I own your factories, so if I do need to break off the desirable bits or pass the cost onto you then I will.  As already happens with stronger currencies and weaker currencies.

Stronger currencies tend to have developed with mitigating circumstances and invariably it changes the structure of its economy.  If this is done properly it works and more specialised fields will open up to them.  The brightest and the best seek out these opportunities.  Nobody can doubt that the comparable strength of the pound to other currencies has resulted in a brain gain for the UK.  That in turn leads to innovation and high end manufacture.  

Hence we see that little ol' Britain with the 5th strongest currency in the world is the world's 7th largest manufacturer and has the world's largest financial centre.  The country with the strongest currency in the world has also the 5th highest GDP per capita in the world.

A strong currency doesn't mean a weak economy if you capitalise on the benefits of a strong currency.  To a greater extent Britain has and its only in the mess it is in now because of Brown mismanagement and Blair waste...and given that, they managed to bail themselves out and are now the only potential G8 AAA bailer for the Euro, other than Germany.

It's really not a problem.

&gt;If not then you are hopeless.

Charming - I'm the one that had to walk you through how I can agree to all your points from the 'other side' and how it is easier to exploit countries with weaker currencies.

As for ""you don't mention where you get this money from"" in relation to living it like a king...not been to France or Spain recently, can I take it?  Whole swathes of Brits have been able to move out there and to change the property scene with second homes because of the strength of the currency, even though sometimes the taxation is higher.

&gt;You talk of the economy so vaguely. It baffles me.  Use a realistic example please.

SAYS THE ONE!!!   I know it baffles you, I'm having to stoop and still baby feed you.

Okay, realistic example.  If you're French or Spanish you will have to pay more for a family home in the French countryside or on the Spanish coast for the simple reason that foreign investment has driven the prices up.  If you're in Venice, Italy, you might be very concerned for the local economy because most of the housing ends up in foreign hands and stays empty for most of the year, meanwhile local residents have to move away.  Yes this is also because of desirable locations being purchased by the wealthy, but one look at what has happened to France and Spain and it is clear that the wave of British expats are not limited to the elite.  They're just wealthy in comparison.  Pensions are worth more,  UK dividends are worth more.

Now I might have to work until I'm 50, 60 or 70 to be able to comfortably retire in my own country if it has a strong currency because it is all relative.  But if my currency has 10:1 parity with a weaker currency whatever pot of treasure I put aside for my retirement is worth 10x as much in the weaker currency.  So if I sell up and move there I will have buying power, if it is a migration prices will be move up artificially to the natives.  You're right that I will also be able to buy a business, land, but it's not the person that's always lived there that is going to be the owner, the landlord.  That's me.  He's the worker and the tenant.

What your brain cannot comprehend is that the country with a weaker currency is weak. You are perceive the reality in such a false way that it is disgusting. I never said that the country with a weaker currency is always prosperous. What i did though was to state the obvious consequenses of having a weaker currency. You on the other hand tried, in a completely reactionary manner, changed the subject with the object and used the words ""weaker"" and ""stronger"" with their literally meaning. 

&gt;And I'm going to go with, where countries with strong currencies currently get their money. I'm also going to remind you that as your foreign investor, with the strong currency, I own your factories, so if I do need to break off the desirable bits or pass the cost onto you then I will. As already happens with stronger currencies and weaker currencies.

This simplistic view is why you cannot understand the reality. You do not just break off. You invest in the company and you are bound by that state's laws. Additionally, you are not without risks. This isn't a zero sum game. You want to make a profit? By default you are risking your capital. 

&gt;As for ""you don't mention where you get this money from"" in relation to living it like a king...not been to France or Spain recently, can I take it? Whole swathes of Brits have been able to move out there and to change the property scene with second homes because of the strength of the currency, even though sometimes the taxation is higher.

You didn't answer my question. You do not mention where you get the money from in this statement. Let me solve it for you. Whether you work in the public or private sector, you are getting paid. If your economy is not competitive then your state and the firms will borrow to  fulfill the demands. You can't pay the loans back? You go into recession (hint: austerity measures). Recession means less buying power. Good luck with that. That's when a competitive country with a product surplus will export the goods to you and because their currency is weaker they can still profit.
It is a circle.

&gt; Okay, realistic example. If you're French or Spanish you will have to pay more for a family home in the French countryside or on the Spanish coast for the simple reason that foreign investment has driven the prices up.

Foreign investment? This is not how it works. Location and demand will define the price. Then if the local economy cannot absorb the supply and foreigners invest ( so you mean foreign countries with a stronger currency) 
in the property depending on the scale of said investment prices will go up.

a) The specific french countryside property is mainly being used by the rich. What this means is that rich French will not have a problem buying it.

b) If foreigners acquire property it doesn't mean that the prices will rise. For fuck's sake, how did you infer that ? Do you think that a property seller will rise the prices after he supplied the foreigners ? If the demand falls to the earlier stages (before foreign investment) then the prices will remain the same and probably fall, if there is no demand at all.

If you're in Venice, Italy, you might be very concerned for the local economy because most of the housing ends up in foreign hands and stays empty for most of the year, meanwhile local residents have to move away. Yes this is also because of desirable locations being purchased by the wealthy, but one look at what has happened to France and Spain and it is clear that the wave of British expats are not limited to the elite. They're just wealthy in comparison. Pensions are worth more, UK dividends are worth more.

&gt;but one look at what has happened to France and Spain and it is clear that the wave of British expats are not limited to the elite.

Apart from the fact that you don't mention what happened, you still do not understand how it doesn't work against the local population. I explained it above. You think the market as a simple dynamic system. It isn't. There is demand, supply, foreign and local investment. 

&gt;So if I sell up and move there I will have buying power, if it is a migration prices will be move up artificially to the natives. You're right that I will also be able to buy a business, land, but it's not the person that's always lived there that is going to be the owner, the landlord. That's me. He's the worker and the tenant.

For the prices to go up there need to be THOUSANDS of british wealthy midde class citizens to come to France,buy land and affect the market (example). You alone will do jack shit. And as i've been saying since the start of our discussion, the state will profit. In other words, you will be absorbed by the market, not the other way around.

By the way, as for your children, I forgot to mention that the paperwork (and any travels inside the EU) should be way easier if you get them an UK passport too. Also, don't forget to register with the local city hall (""empadronamiento"") as soon as you get a house. You'll need your Spanish IDs and your rental contract/agreement.

Of course you can apply to regular Spanish schools, for free. A lot of expats do so as it's the best way to get integrated. Most British citizens won't learn Spanish (they have their sat UK TV, their own supermarkets, their own residential areas with their own clubs and bars, even their own plumbers!) even after 20 years here.

In 1956 it was pretty much the proletarians who revolted against Communism, with which the system lost its legitimation, which basically means nobody after 1956 really believed in Communism, and therefore the Communist party hierarchy pretty much entirely consisted of selfish, careerist, corrupted machiavellists, not people who actually believe in an ideology.

Therefore, once it became clear the Communist system won't live long, say around 1985, and especially after it collapsed in 1989, the party elites and their allies like media elites, intellectuals formed a kind of informal _mafia_ or network to keep power, money etc.  - not really some kind of centrally planned ""conspiracy"" of course, just a tight Old Boys Network cooperating for their common interests - keep money, keep power: trading favors, engaging in corruption, supporting each other etc.

This mafia, which many Fidesz-supporting Hungarians just call The Network proved to be extremely successful after the change to democracy &amp; social market economy. They pretty much managed to privatize every state-owned business for themselves for peanuts, they became the new capitalist class, they dominated the media, the culture, the intellectual field, the state bureaucracy, pretty much everything. They formed the Socialist Party, which was in 1990 not succesful but the then-powerful Free Democrats (liberals in name only) joined them, who almost toppled the first centre-right democratic government with organizing a cab blockade and legitimized the ex-Commie Socialist Party with the Charta movement, when where the centre-right government fired the ex-Commie reporters from the public radio who belonged to The Network and engaged in pro-Network brainwashing the people, the Charta was basically a big demonstration against it, when formerly-decent liberals marched together with ex-Commies...

Already by the Charta (I think around 1992 or so) the situation was clear. The liberals and ex-Commies (BTW many liberals coming from powerful Commie families) talked all nice, democracy, freedom of speech, constitutionalism, everything you would want, but they basically protected the interests of their mafia, The Network, not the public interest. In order to break The Network and have a system that actually works for the public interest, you had to act ugly - undemocratic, unconstitutional, illiberal.

As for the further successes of The Network, they won 3 of the next 4 elections by totally ridiculous promises and claims, stole everything that wasn't cemented in place, pretty much squeezed the government into a corner in that one case when they didn't win, as basically from the bureaucracy to the media, everybody harmed the government any way they could, so when they finally lost another election - and by a landslide - it was clear that you cannot play Mr. Nice Guy anymore: democracy, liberalism, republicanism, constitutionalism  and other modern values were _so thoroughly corrupted and hijacked by The Network_ that breaking their informal power grip on everything requires that these nice values are to an extent temporarily setting them aside and force The Network out of power for good. 

Our problem is basically that a ""Decommunistization"" movement did not happen the same way as the Denazification in post-war Germany where everybody even slightly tainted by the Nazi system was forced out of both formal and informal power, money, networks etc. Imagine if post-war Germany had Nazis everywhere, banks, media, politics, bureaucracy, business, judges, forming a Mafia, a Network - would it have been OK to play nice with them and be very democratic, liberal and constitutional?

Or it is a bit like you are in Sicily in 1910 and the Mafia owns everything, politics, bureaucrats, judges, media, business, banks, how can you fight them? Certainly you cannot afford to be too liberal, too democratic, too accepting of constitutional liberties.

That is the Fidesz-narrative. If this is true or not, and if true an acceptable price or not, is up to you to decide - there is no final answer as this is hotly debated in Hungary.

EDIT: oh, I forgotten something. This is considered a _moderate_ (centre-right) opinion in Hungary - i.e. that the Mafia, The Network we are up against are our own, it was simply the previous Communist system that created them. The more radical folks think they are not really our own Mafia, but are just a subset of or basically lieutenants of a ""globalist"" conspiracy trying to take over the whole world... I consider that kinda nuts, as it sounds too much like a ""New World Order"" conspiracy theory, but that's what the radical folks like typically students think. (I mean nationalist radicals like Jobbik, that is pretty much the default student party, the party of folks who demonstrate against the WTO and suchlike, as there is no serious left-wing radicalism in Hungary.)",0,1324373608,null,0,true,0,c39mhvc,t3_niq4n,t1_c39mhvc,t1_c39g3o8,1428048962,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

The legislative process itself in the EU is so convoluted and complicated I will not try to explain it fully here. Suffice to say that in some cases The commission and council of EU can together approve laws together without parliament. 
In the case of ACTA and software patents EU uses the codecision process, which gives almost equal power to the council and the parliament.

Oh, you're starting to lose it.

&gt;. I never said that the country with a weaker currency is always prosperous.

Didn't say you did.

&gt;What i did though was to state the obvious consequenses of having a weaker currency. 

And I agreed, which really seems to have gotten your goat.

&gt;You on the other hand tried, in a completely reactionary manner, changed the subject with the object and used the words ""weaker"" and ""stronger"" with their literally meaning.

When writing and using words I find literal use to be helpful...

&gt;This simplistic view is why you cannot understand the reality. 

Or, from an objective angle, why I have an understanding of reality you struggle with.

&gt;You didn't answer my question.

Yes I did.  I even did it with real world examples.

&gt;If your economy is not competitive then your state and the firms will borrow to fulfill the demands. You can't pay the loans back? You go into recession

And I agree but that has nothing to do with what we were arguing.  You might want to shoehorn it in as a diversion because you realise you're on a losing streak, but it's not going to help.  You gave 3 examples, I agreed to all of them, but simply highlighted that you were only seeing it from one angle.  You were all for singing the praises of a weaker currency bringing in tourism.  I simply pointed out that if the tourists were coming because they had a stronger currency, they also had disposable income, greater ability to travel.  

I know exactly which side of the deal I'd rather be on, and if you were being honest so would you.

&gt;a) The specific french countryside property is mainly being used by the rich. What this means is that rich French will not have a problem buying it.

No it's not.  You're just assuming that.  It's being nearly 100% used by the middle-class.  That's the whole point.  It's not what is open to discussion.  It is an observable fact that it is the UK middle-class and the retired that have bought secondary, holiday and retirement homes on the continent.  They're not rich in their own country, they're just comparably rich once they've moved their assets into a weaker currency.

&gt;If foreigners acquire property it doesn't mean that the prices will rise. For fuck's sake, how did you infer that ?

You really are fond of your schoolboy errors aren't you. If demand goes up prices will go up.  If there's more people bidding, prices will go up.  If it is comparably rich foreigners driving up the demand then prices for the natives will be seen to go up significantly as to if the Jonny foreigner wasn't there.

&gt; You think the market as a simple dynamic system. It isn't. There is demand, supply, foreign and local investment.


I think you're going to find it hard rationalising to any economist that if there are more people bidding on a property that the price does not go up.

&gt;For the prices to go up there need to be THOUSANDS of british wealthy midde class citizens to come to France,buy land and affect the market (example).

WELL ISN'T THAT FORTUNATE!

'Cos there's HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS!  The middle class are leaving to capitalise, immigrants turn up in droves to make for themeselves what they have made.  Ask any honest Frenchman or Spaniard how many middleclass Brits with young families or pensioners have moved into their countries and changed the property market.

Now try and insult me again, but it is observable fact, whereas you're just speculating from a room without knowing.  In fact, since you said it would take thousands, and since we can see there are hundreds of thousands, I'll take that as an admission that you concede the point.



&gt;It works because you still do not understand. You insist on some pseudo-financial drivel. You are ignorant and too proud to come off the bullshit.

Which is strange because I'm the only one that has been to show the effects happening right now of what I'm arguing.  You've simply been left trying to insult because I can see things from multiple angles and perspectives - which is why when you first raised up the three points and I agreed but simply argued it from the tourist's, or the investor's perspective, you couldn't fathom.  You simply couldn't hold two perspectives at the same time.

&gt;More bullshit. You are being spoon fed. You are being told at least three times now how stupid and simplistic your premises are but you insist.

You've actually provided additional argument for my case.  It's nothing to do with currency why Britain can export, the pound is a hell of a lot stronger than the Yuan but British manufacturing perseveres because it provides high end manufacture.  The pound can go stronger and stronger but they still have to pay to get that level of engineering.  China is low-grade mass production.  The Pound could keep falling for ever and a day and it is not going to be competitive with China.

&gt;When writing and using words I find literal use to be helpful...

That's tragic. If you cannot perceive the meaning of words in a specific context, then you are either stupid or stubborn. Nevertheless, you have to do so because then you will see that a premise has a different meaning and hence a different function in an argument (hint: not a contradiction).

&gt;And I agree but that has nothing to do with what we were arguing. You might want to shoehorn it in as a diversion because you realise you're on a losing streak, but it's not going to help. You gave 3 examples, I agreed to all of them, but simply highlighted that you were only seeing it from one angle. You were all for singing the praises of a weaker currency bringing in tourism. I simply pointed out that if the tourists were coming because they had a stronger currency, they also had disposable income, greater ability to travel.

But this is not a negative to the currency! Both gain and that's why it is a symbiotic relationship. You cannot still understand that you didn't counterargue. You just stated the obvious. As for the losing streak remark, any chance you share ancenstry with Joan of Arc ?  

&gt;You really are fond of your schoolboy errors aren't you. If demand goes up prices will go up. If there's more people bidding, prices will go up. If it is comparably rich foreigners driving up the demand then prices for the natives will be seen to go up significantly as to if the Jonny foreigner wasn't there.

The foreigners with a stronger currency need to come in thousands to affect the prices. Also, i explained it to you :

a) It depends on the market (Rich from both countries will not have the problem to buy the house)

b) Depends on the magnitude of the foreign market forces. 

&gt;I think you're going to find it hard rationalising to any economist that if there are more people bidding on a property that the price does not go up.

And this is the basic, super-standard mistake a rookie makes. You just answered instead of me. More people. Thank you.

&gt;WELL ISN'T THAT FORTUNATE!
'Cos there's HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS! The middle class are leaving to capitalise, immigrants turn up in droves to make for themeselves what they have made. Ask any honest Frenchman or Spaniard how many middleclass Brits with young families or pensioners have moved into their countries and changed the property market.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2005/may/15/workandcareers.europeanunion

And yet you failed to counterargue, AGAIN! You posted a link that states that thousands of middle class citizen leave Britain to live abroad. That means nothing when you do not show with evidence how it affects the market. What numbers, with what exact ranges, participate in local markets. I underlined in my post the need for demand, supply and prices. You again didn't answer. I will offend you again because you are starting to tire me out with your obviously deceiving demeanour. I am not certain if you do it on purpose or not, though. Anyway, again, you lost the point.

&gt; Which is strange because I'm the only one that has been to show the effects happening right now of what I'm arguing.  

Nope, as shown above. 

&gt;You're a squeaky toy and I would rather be a tourist with the money and time to travel, than receive the tourism and for the world to be too expensive.


And that's more proof of your rage inducing ignorance. You'd rather be a tourist. What ? You'd rather be spending money in another country, buying products and boosting the economy. Thanks man!

1. The election commission decides in technical issues, when something needs to be acted upon. The election law regulates many-many details of an election. Just because 5 central delegates were elected by the Fidesz majority parliament it does not mean that they would and could cheat an election. Their one-time mandate reduces the possibility of corruption. 
2. The ""balance review"" is going on in Hungarian media for 20 years (or so). It really isn't anything, just a statistical number of government appearance/opposition appearance events in certain mediums. Some media have 80% government 20% opposition ratio, some have 60%/40%. These statistics are just statistics, its up to the viewers to judge if a media seems to be balanced or not. The authority does not issue any fines for any unbalanced reporting or unbalanced ratios. The fines, where they are really applicable are also not that harsh, for a single person the maximum is about a media persons one months of salary, for a TV station its about one days worth of operating costs. If i remember correctly, two TV stations were fined for maximums (for showing excessive violence), but no individual persons. Nobody actually cares about the balance statistic. Contrary to what some blogs try to suggest, the media authority's biggest concerns are the reality shows and children programs, not political debates.
3. There are no such parties right now, so i can't tell you when would a party qualify, but it would certainly be a non-trivial judiciary process. But, for example the Germans are considering banning their far-right party, so having the possibility (or even need) of banning a party is not unique in Europe. The nearest example is when during the previous government the ""Garda"" was banned, which was the ""militant"" arm of Jobbik.

Of course it is.  Again.  I AGREE and I always have.  I simply argued one gained far more than the other...and I showed real life examples proving it.  You however seem strangely evicted from providing real life examples. I simply maintain it is better to be the owner, the land holder, the investor the tourist, than it is to be the owned, the tenant, the invested and the visited.  Of course the owned, the tenant, the invested and the visitied has gains, much as any slave would - but they'd swap it in an instant to be the master.

'Effect' if you're going to use my language, if you don't mind.  Whatever, I just provided sources that that is in fact what happens.  Bury your head in the sand if you wish.  

You just conceded that it would mean thousands of people to deliver this 'e'ffect, to 'a'ffect it as I said.  I simply showed how the figure is in the *hundreds* of thousands.

So again I accept your concession.

&gt;b) Depends on the magnitude of the foreign market forces.

Of course it does.  I AGREE.  But you're the one relying on an argument of stronger currencies INVESTING and MOVING to weaker currencies and economies to EXPLOIT their advantage.   You're actually arguing my point, beyond 101 you'd appreciate this.  It's okay, I'll wait.

&gt;And this is the basic, super-standard mistake a rookie makes. You just answered instead of me. More people. Thank you.

TO be clear you just argued that more people bidding on a property does not drive the cost up.  You had been arguing that a middle-class migration to weaker currencies did not drive the price up for those already there.

*You just forgot what you were arguing for the sake of arguing, didn't you?*

n00b

&gt;And yet you failed to counterargue, AGAIN! 

That was in response to you saying that it was only the rich moving to a weaker currency to exploit, and to two links provided by me which showed that it was the middle-class exploiting the weaker currency, and a weaker currency professional moving to a stronger currency.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt;In explaining why neutral Britain went to war with Germany, Paul Kennedy, in The Rise of the Anglo-German Antagonism, 1860-1914, claimed that it was critical for war that Germany become economically more powerful than Britain, but he downplayed the disputes over economic trade imperialism, the Baghdad Railway, confrontations in Eastern Europe, high-charged political rhetoric and domestic pressure-groups. Germany's reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain increasingly appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially in seeing the invasion of Belgium as a necessary military tactic or a profound moral crime. The German invasion of Belgium was not important because the British decision had already been made and the British were more concerned with the fate of France.[47] Kennedy argues that by far the main reason was London's fear that a repeat of 1870—when Prussia and the German states smashed France—would mean Germany, with a powerful army and navy, would control the English Channel, and northwest France. British policy makers insisted that would be a catastrophe for British security.[48] [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_World_War_I#British_security_issues)

You do not know what the word "" concession "" is. You are beyond delluded. Let's see what you write again. 

&gt;Again, it is you that's just conceded you're wrong so condescension isn't a luxury you can afford.

Obviously, if you don't know what the noun means, you don't know what the verb means as well. Not a big suprise there. 

&gt;Says the one that that came out with 3 points to which I specifically addressed and AGREED with, but highlighted the alternative, more provisional perspective, and to which you tried to argue that I hadn't addressed at all, and then conceded later that, in fact, I had. You would go on to address them. Cognitive dissonance much?

I argued that you were wrong.What you addressed here was the obvious consequences of that symbiotic life. My initial response was made against your remark to the OP : That you would prefer the stronger currency anytime. I explained it to you why the weaker currency has advantages but you, like a stubborn manchild, tried to passively aggressively at the start  underline why the stronger currency is better. That's exactly the reason why you failed. You replaced ""PROOF"" with ""PREFERENCE"" / ""I'D RATHER. You are back pedalling now, because you know you are weak.

You just conceded that it would mean thousands of people to deliver this 'e'ffect, to 'a'ffect it as I said. I simply showed how the figure is in the hundreds of thousands.

I laugh at your attempt to be condescending. Yes, i am using your language. Interestingly enough, logical thinking depends on the individual's intelligence, quality you do not, sadly, have. 

You simply showed the figure. The figure alone shows nothing when the important factors are not included (demand, supply, salary, local prices and laws). I had mentioned those factors in the original post. You , as the deceiving little scum you are, chose not to include them. Well done.

What ?


&gt;TO be clear you just argued that more people bidding on a property does not drive the cost up. You had been arguing that a middle-class migration to weaker currencies did not drive the price up for those already there.
You just forgot what you were arguing for the sake of arguing, didn't you?

Y U SO STUPID? I said that whether the prices drop or rise, depends on a variety of things not just foreign market powers (in this case Foreigners with a stronger currency buying property). It depends on the demand, the supply (if the available property is absorbed by the local economy ) , the salary of the foreigners and the prices. Also, it depends on the type of market. Please, wake the fuck up. It is the 4th time i mention this but you still insist.

&gt;That was in response to you saying that it was only the rich moving to a weaker currency to exploit, and to two links provided by me which showed that it was the middle-class exploiting the weaker currency, and a weaker currency professional moving to a stronger currency.

THE LINKS DID NOT show that the middle class exploits the currency. Again read the above answer. Also, i said that certain markets like property in wealthy areas are mainly acquired by the rich. You can read, can you?
Also, a weaker currency professional doesn't make less money necessarily. If let's say the ratio of the euro to the pound was 2 : 1, a eurozone citizen making 2000 is making the exact same as the one in the UK who makes 1000.

&gt;If foreigners acquire property it doesn't mean that the prices will rise. For fuck's sake, how did you infer that ? Do you think that a property seller will rise the prices after he supplied the foreigners ? If the demand falls to the earlier stages (before foreign investment) then the prices will remain the same and probably fall, if there is no demand at all.

Later, i say it even more clearly (2nd post)

Rhineland-style Sauerbraten with Raisin Gravy
Marinade:
4 cups dry red wine (preferably German),
1 cup water,
2 1/2 tblsp freshly squeezed lemon juice,
1 sm. yellow onion, peeled &amp;amp; finely chopped,
10 peppercorns,
2 bay leaves,
4 whole cloves.

Sauerbraten:

1 (3lb) boneless top round roast with a thin outer layer of fat,
2 tblsp minced parsley,
1 teasp salt,
1/2 teasp freshly ground black pepper,
3 tblsp all-purpose flour,
3 tblsp unsalted butter or margarine,
2 med. carrots, peeled &amp;amp; thinly sliced,
2 lrg yellow onions, peeled &amp;amp; coarsely chopped,
1 tblsp tomato paste,
1 tblsp sugar,
2 tblsp sweet sherry,
1/2 cup medium-dry red wine (preferably German),
1 cup seedless raisins,
1-2 tblsp red currant jelly or orange marmelade (if needed to mellow tartness of gravy).

Makes 4 to 6 servings.

For the marinade: Bring all ingerdients to a fairly rapid boil in an uncovered medium-sized heavy saucepan over moderate heat and cook 5 minutes.

For the Sauerbraten: Place the beef in a large, heatproof, non-metallic bowl. Pour in the hot marinade and cool to room temperature. Add the parsley, turn the beef in the marinade, cover, and marinate in refrigerator for 4 days, turning the beef in marinate every 8 hours.

On the 5th day, remove the beef from marinate and pat dry. Strain marinate, reserving both liquid and solids. Rub the beef with half the salt and pepper, then dredge with the flour.

Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium-sized heavy kettle or dutch oven over moderate heat, add the beef, and brown well on all sides; this will take 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the beef to a plate, pour off and discard all drippings, then add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter to the pot and melt over moderate heat. Add the carrots, onions, and reserved marinade solids and saute, stirring often, for 5 minutes. Return the beef to the pot, add 2 cups of the reserved marinade and the tomato paste and bring to a boil over high heat. Adjust heat so marinade bubbles gently, cover pot with foil then set lid in place and simmer the Sauerbraten 3 1/2 to 4 hours, turning occasionally, until tender. Carefully replace the foil and lid each time you turn the meat.

As soon as the Sauerbraten is tender, remove it to a large warmed plate and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Skim as much fat as possible from the sauce, then strain it, discarding the solids. Return sauce to pot, add remaining reserved marinade along with the sugar, sherry, red wine, and raisins and boil, uncovered, over high heat for 5 to 7 minutes, until reduced by half and of good gravy consistency. Taste, and if the gravy is too sour, stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons of the jelly. Season gravy with salt and pepper.

To serve: Slice the Sauerbraten across the grain about 1/4"" thick, arrange on a large heated platter and smother with gravy. Pass any extra gravy separately.",0,1324417237,null,0,false,0,c39rxf9,t3_nkcgs,t1_c39rxf9,t3_nkcgs,1428051528,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

Dass ich Thomas Gottschalks Sendungen mitfinanziere ist zwar nicht das gelbe vom Ei aber nur ein kleiner Preis dafür, dass ich auch Sendungen sehen kann, die mir wirklich gefallen. Thomas Gottschalk ist ja nicht nur im Fernsehen um Leute wie dich und mich zu ärgern, sondern weil viele seine Sendungen mögen. Es ist eben auch Aufgabe des Rundfunkrates, dafür zu sorgen, dass alle Bürger auf ihre Kosten kommen - und es kann nicht nur 24h laufen, was du und ich gerne sehen möchten. 

Auf der anderen Seite muss ich dir natürlich Recht geben, wenn es darum geht, dass das Programm der Öffentlich-Rechtlichen mit der Zeit sehr stark abgebaut hat. Das ist aber wieder ein anderer Streitpunkt der nichts mit der Daseinsberechtigung der GEZ zu tun hat.

Honestly a lot of people don't understand how and why Atatürk is so important to us, without Atatürk we would probably be a shithole as most muslim countries.

I also think that time will change a lot of things and considering that talking about the genocide was once a taboo and people nowadays actually talk about it, there was definitely some progress in the last few years. Further the laws you counted will be changed/erased by next year. Our constitution is currently under revision.

If  'Twat' and 'Bastard' were to meet in person we'd take the same pot-shots at each other, but that'd be okay because we'd accept that as cultural norms.  That is to say we'd rag each other rotten (call each other terrible names) until the other wept, and then we'd start on the Welsh.

What I'm trying to say is that someone calling you a blanc-flagged-cheese-guzzling-surrender-monkey should be taken in the same context.  

British humour stipulates that you now call me an, ""ugly-yellow-toothed-big-penised-pompous-prick-of-an-asshole-who'd-if-my-mother-hadn't-fucked-my- grand-uncle-then-perhaps-I'd-have-a-chin-you-inbred-wonder!""

If we're not offending you, per se, then you should consider ourselves friends but if, when offending you, you are not being offended, and if we don't have a flag, then be offended for not offending you.  In this sense it is an offense to not offend you when dictation clearly states that you should be offended, and if you are not offended.   

I can see how the confusion might arise.  Protocols should be obeyed and in this sense the Scottish cunt should have offered his offense in lieu of your French bastadry, I can only apologise for his wankerish ways by saying that we all are in fact slags, on behalf of my cheap English harbour-whore self. 

The rule is if you're not being offended then you should be offended.  Simple really.

[..] A spokeswoman for the prosecution service, Gabriella Skoda, told state news agency MTI on Wednesday that the investigation would be conducted by District VII police headquarters. [..]
&gt;
&gt;The rapper’s new song Himnusz (Anthem) - whose video was filmed at an anti-government demonstration in Budapest on 23 October - quotes the national anthem, and, true to the genre, is laden with expletives. “F*** Orbán, F*** the government, F*** the MSZP and Gyurcsány... ” it begins, in reference to the prime minister, the [oppositional] Socialist Party and a former prime minister. Dopeman said he was only expressing what the “average Hungarian” feels, news magazine HVG reported on its website. [..]
&gt;
&gt;Pityinger said it was wrong to describe his song as a reworking of the national anthem, arguing that he only inserted some lines from the same poem by Kölcsey that Ferenc Erkel set to music when composing the national anthem. The racist far-right website kuruc.info has urged its readers to lodge complaints against the Dopeman song.

The fact that Britishers take this piss out of the French is a sign that they love the French.  If ever people stopped taking the piss it should be read as a sign that you should want them to start.

If I call you an arsehole, you should be offended, but doubly so if I stopped.  If Australia should ever stop calling the British, then they should be worried.  If, in short, it ever comes to the point that we ever stop calling names amongst our friends then all hell is going to break loose!

It's only because I can call you a knob, and you me a pillock, that we know that we are still friends!

&gt; Would you agree with this sentiment? And if you do, can you explain me what makes people dislike France?

We don't dislike the French.  We feel at liberty to call you names, and we embrace it when you call us them back!   Think of it this way:

I'll call my brother a useless two-bit schlump and name him rotten (call him bad names).  I can do that because he's my brother.  If somebody else does it, I'll kill them.  That's the relationship the French have with us, and if anybody else says different they'll have the two of us to deal with.  

My brother is not a two-bit schlump, but I'll call him it.  If anybody else does I'll drive my car through their house.  Likewise a British man reserves the right to call the French terrible names.  Don't take offense, it is a term of endearment.  If ever something were to happen against the French the British car would be the first to drive through someone's house.  

**tl:d:r**  People don't dislike the French, they dislike the British more, but calling the French names is actually a term of endearment when it comes from the British.

Also keep in mind that the unemployment rate for non-qualified jobs in Spain is around 30% and it's difficult to land a job. The minimum wage is ~600€ ($800) for a full time job, and waiters are required to be paid that too (they usually make much more than that if they are any good / working on a busy restaurant or bar - also, we give tips here, but usually just the little coins that would round up to a Euro integer -&gt; 10.85€ bill could leave you 0.15€ tip).

The current structure of the US is a direct recognition by the original US states that a structure similar to the EU didn't work for them.

IBM scientists are researching how to link your brain to your devices, such as a computer or a smartphone, so you only have to think about calling someone and it happens. For example, see a cube on your computer screen and think about moving it to the left, and it will. Beyond electronics control, possible applications include physical rehabilitation and understanding of brain disorders such as autism.

Tribalism is just human nature. It exists in all societies (except for totalitarian regimes perhaps). Trying to get rid of it is just utopian nonsense.

Nobody said anything about ""crushing that group of people"", but about getting rid of a political system that currently emphasizes the concept of the nation state.

The nation state and nationalism is a *historically new invention*. Nationalism in its current form came into existence in the late 1700's, and did not really rise to prominence until the late 1800's. There's nothing inherent in human nature that requires it.

Nationalism does not celebrate diversity - it celebrates an ""us vs. them"" mentality that tries to force you to pick a group based on where you live. Reducing nationalism frees the individual to express themselves  and their allegiances without being restricted by an artificially created grouping.

And while we might not get rid of tribalism entirely, we can most certainly move towards a system where it gets far less prominence.

We went on a guided tour of Wiesbaden earlier this Fall.  The middle-aged German guide made the comment about how the city had changed, *""... since we lost the war.""*  Maybe it was just me, but I thought this was a very odd comment.  The Third Reich lost the war, and the German people, most not without some culpability, paid a huge price for it.  The students in the White Rose group were turned in to the Gestapo by a *janitor* for Heaven's sake!

If you have not done so, read *My Opposition* by [Friedrich Kellner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Kellner) who in my opinion was the bravest man in Germany during that period of time.

All that being said, since WWII, Germany has developed into a model of decent society and economic success for which it should deservedly be proud.  As an American, I am often envious of current life in Germany.  

On the other hand, the German history is a powerful reminder for all of us how easily it is for humans to turn on each other.  Nazi Germany is not necessarily the worst example in history, just the best documented.  In its history, the USA has committed atrocities quite equal to Nazi Germany if not on the same scale.

I will respond in english :) 

First of all, congrats on studying abroad, Lyon is a wonderful city and I am currently doing an exchange here as well. What school will you be going to? 

Do you know where this apartment is? 750 euros is a bit on the upper middle range. I live in an HLM (basically low income) and pay 411 a month. I also get a subsidy from the CAF because I am a student. You should apply for this as well, because with it, I pay about 270 a month. Pretty much everybody is eligible, but you won't know how much you get until you apply.

Now finding an apartment is really fucking hard. You deal with the government a lot here, which has its ups and downs. You get health care and free money, but it also makes it difficult to get a bank account, move or even a cell phone. Moving in september is probably the hardest, just because that is when everyone moves. You can apply to a lot of residence halls and many of them won't require a co-signer or citizenship. Working your way up to nicer places, you start having to deal with citizenship and cosigners and stuff. 

Depending on where the you are, 750 could be worth it if you have the money. Bellecour and Vieux Lyon are great places to live, and although I personally can't afford that, I could see why people who had the money to would live there. I live in the 7th arr. next to my school, Lyon 1, and feel quite lucky even though my apartment is tiny. Also the campuses are really spread out. Lyon 1 is way out there from the cool spots, and so maybe you would want to live closer to the school than to the parties. You can also looking into getting a 'coloc', or a roommate. You can also live with older women who rent out rooms (this is quite normal and actually very nice for many).

You just argued that a strong currency doesn't give purchasing power in weaker currencies by comparing the pound *TO THE UK!*

In fact the French government has even had to introduce policy to address the problem, which is why ICF lego buildings are springing up to provide affordable housing for those priced out.

You say it is because of demand, and yet you've just been shown that it is not the French buying the properties.  It is a fact of the land that the comparable strength of the pound enabled a middle-class churn, and they've exploited it to their own ends with trend bucking gains.

Notice how you're arguing how you think it should work in theory, and how I'm arguing with FACTS and ACTUALITIES.  You're arguing how you think it should happen, and I'm showing something that HAS HAPPENED and is still HAPPENING.  I can tell you from experience that the stronger pound has very much enabled British exploitation of foreign markets.  You can't drive down the coast of Spain and not see it.

It's not just France or Spain either, expats benefit from a strong currency wherever they might go,

I've only strung you along this far to allow you to make a fool of yourself.

I understand your understanding isn't comfortable with it, but that's a problem with your understanding.    

If the French aren't buying existing property, but property is going up, there's hundred of thousands of Brits empowered by the pound and they have a greater purchasing power, people are being priced out by expats capitalising on a strong currency, after all, something is pushing the market up and the expats, British investors  are clear that an important aspect is their strong currency and their purchasing power.  

You don't want to accept it but it is a fact.  It's already happened.

For once driving on the right is believed to lead to less accidents this might be because humans are right eye dominant. It might also be because of the usual dominant right hand is on the steering wheel when driving on the left, instead of being on the transmission (in manual transmission cars).
Then rather relevant to the U.K is people who visits and who usually drive on the right side of the road. Suddenly having to do the opposite i can imagine causes a lot of discomfort which might cause you to be more suspectible to an accident.

Then there are problems with switching of course, like you mentioned, money for once, changing signs and road layout isn't free, by that logic now is indeed a pretty bad time.

But if many of the older generation don't know the system it's futile to try and force it on them. And, of course, counterproductive, because people will view it as a demonstration of power as much as reasonable policy. 

You could actually draw a parallel (albeit not a particularly direct one) with the English language- similar to metric, English is a de facto standard in certain areas (particularly science and international affairs), and it's useful for people to be able to communicate easily with each other, as much as possible. Now there may be a logic to having things like some signs in English (say, at airports), or teaching kids English in schools. But obviously if the EU started mandating that English had to be used alongside the local language, or that kids should be taught a minimum standard of English, people would become pissed off, and rightly so. In sensitive situations it's better to leave it to the national or local governments, or to individuals or companies to make their own decisions.

You linked to a paragraph which talked about people struggling to get on the market in the UK.  That's not who's migrating to France, they are people who say for themselves that it is to capitalise on gains on their UK property and the strong pound.

You've just been caught in an outright lie.

Didn't I?

Yes I did.  I even linked to articles about it.

&gt;In fact the article doesn't say where they go. It says to Europe. Also, don't be a fucking liar. Nowhere did the article say that the French don't buy property.

Oh trust me.  France is the number one destination  and you've already been given figures.  They do represent 11% of the market

                ""British buyers represent 11 per cent of

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/travel/france_show/8744662/Understanding-the-French-property-market.html

I simply said that only 57% of French people own their own properties, and that's true,

                 ""But the downside is that the rising value
                 of French real estate is only good news 
                 to those who already own housing — a 
                 group that makes up only 57% of the 
                 French population."" 

http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2039840,00.html

As for the bit you chose to put in bold, you've already been told and given links which show that the French government has had to introduce policy to allow those not on the ladder to own a home in a market which has continued to price them out.  There are government subsidies for ICF new builds, and existing renovation.  They've had to do it because the French property market rich with expats has left them behind.  Expats which are clear the role a stronger currency has served.  In fact, as parity neared expats began to leave, so the trend and correlation to currency is clear from 2009 when the Euro was quickly gaining ground on the pound:

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/propertyinfrance/cest-la-folie/5093769/Property-in-France-Are-British-expats-really-leaving-France.html

As the trend reversed and the pound gained strength, the market too  improved in direct relation.

(I'm feeling very smug right now - I just wanted you to know that)

&gt;And lol @ the fucking articles.

Oh this should be good...

&gt;You link a help resources site.

This makes no sense, my illiterate friend. The article stated that your house prices are rising up. This is a fact. So your whole argument that the stronger currency will buy property easier and hence cause the rise of the prices is not exclusive for the weaker currencies.

From the same article:

&gt;Back in France, however, housing investors — especially those in Paris — are still loving life. The reason: price gains in 2010 pushed the median square-foot price in the capital to over $650 for the first time ever — a level that's set to increase to $742 within a year. Though it's difficult to make an accurate comparison with larger and far more diverse housing markets, existing numbers suggest Paris is creeping closer to the prices seen in **notoriously** expensive London and New York City. But experts warn that isn't necessarily a good thing.

More here : 

&gt;r — and which will only get tighter until **both government and developers summon the will, and the finances, to build more homes.**

So this isn't cause and effect. The cause isn't the foreigner's buying power.

He'd taken the housing solution proposed to him by his program, something probably like yours: 650 or 750 euros (can't remember) per month in a vastly overpriced ""residence etudiante"".

It was around 20 square meters with kitchen corner and bathroom, furnished, with crappy shared internet (though since he had a telephone line, I assume he could have had his own internet line even for just a semester). Like any residence etudiante, it had some services such as laundry room, maybe exercise room. And elevator. The bottom line was, he got shafted. On top of that, he broke a single screw on a crappy chair that somehow costs 70 euro and they want him to pay for a new one.

I have a 32 square meter unfurnished place for 450 euro (and the one below me has furniture, for maybe 25 euro more?).

As for an alternative, I'm afraid it might take some time so you may need a place to stay. I'm not sure how it goes for foreign students here or how it works in the US, but I've had to have a 'garant', someone who can show that he's making enough money to cover the apartment in case something happens. Also has to sign some papers himself. If you already have to provide that kind of proof for your student VISA, perhaps that would be enough.

I think the best option would be to look for someone already looking for roommates. If not, get a flat yourself.

I'm sure Havel would take issue with certain aspects of medicine and technology that flow from a similar vein of believing in the sensibility of standards (though here I make assumptions based on my, admittedly, cursory knowledge of Havel,) but to understand him as being firmly against development as you're framing it is to misunderstand him. 

Consider the point you bring up about the state of the destitute in the Western world. Welfare and studies of poverty rely on ideas of what is standard for a population, and consequently we should probably understand them as being something Havel would criticize. But while these institutions do improve the average quality of living for the poor, I think he'd argue (judging from this article) that the lot of the poor could be improved more profoundly by community structures founded upon a sense of personal responsibility, rather than state structures that are forced by their scope to rely upon generalized assumption about what is best.

There's a lot more to say about this, but what I think is important is that it's possible to be critical of the sort of progress that Havel describes here while still being in favour of development.

I think she was a harsh, determined politician who made some tough decisions that needed to be made.  The UK in the 1970s was economically a mess, and it was going to get worse.  I remember seeing footage of various huge strikes on TV when I was a kid - in my view, UK industry was a joke.  The cars were terrible, the electronics laughable, and the whole place seemed infused with a musty, inefficient air of failure.  So something had to be done.

Unfortunately, her methods were, in hindsight, largely wrong - doing huge damage to things like public transportation and education.  But it's a bit trite to look at this with the benefit of hindsight, because, like with Reagan's policies, most of this seemed new and revolutionary at the time.  As I recall, it was sort of a ""it's all gone to shit, do something, DO ANYTHING"" mentality.  

By contrast, Germany seems to have gotten over what is called ""die Wende"" (the change/rotation) pretty well - the move from an industrial society to a more modern economy.  Probably it's a mixture of reasonable economic policies, culture, and learning from the mistakes of others.

The corruption and inequality resulting from deregulation and privatization needn't have happened, but they did, so history's not kind to her.  But I'd say it's debatable whether the negative effects of her policies outweigh the probable long-term results of what she was attempting to address.

Correct me if I'm wrong but the conflict in the Armenian genocide is that Turkey is denying they committed a genocide- they killed the amount of people Armenia claims (1.5 million) and they claim it was not done for racial reasons, but for practical ones (Armenians generally collaborated with Russia, Turkey's enemy during WW1 due to similar religion)- but they don't deny that they did a massacre.
