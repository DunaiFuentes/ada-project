In any case, the behaviour is inexcusable (though I still think it's important not to call a murderer a genocidaire.)

Your conception of the dark ages is totally inaccurate though. Christianity was the dominant religion of rome for 200 years before the empire collapsed. Christianity disappeared from Europe for 400 years afterward. The places where knowledge was preserved were Rome, Constantinople and Ireland, all under the influence of the church. In Ireland in particular, large numbers of secular and religious books were copied and kept in the monasteries themselves. These were later spread throughout Europe by Irish missionary activity. I'm reading a copy of Tacitus' Histories at the moment which would never have survived if it wasn't for its preservation by monks. We would know fuck all about Ancient Rome without the church.

Oh, almost forgot - Plato and Aristotle were key influences on early Christian theology also. We'd be missing an awful lot of their works without the church as well.

3) [Hotel Choiseul Opera](http://www.hotelchoiseuloperaparis.com/) - there are quite a few like this - subtract a star - friends have stayed there - it's ok. .

Your budget is in between cheap and expensive . You might be able to find a nice good quality in between at a good rate considering it's out of season but in season a different situation all together . Le Terrass is 1228.50€ for the week at the moment but you might be able to do a deal with them out of season but in season it will be quite a bit more . Other than that the Ibis is 539€ for the week . Choiseul is 651€ .

Although it's not as bad, it was still screwed up. And it's not that far, both of my grandfathers went to Algeria during their mandatory army period. 

It wasn't a massive front war though, more a guerilla war, so French people aren't as sensitive about it (also, it wasn't in France). Most people don't talk about it simply because we don't know much about it, except that some French military screwed up.

Basically the shameful part was the use of torture by the French army (and by the Algerian rebels as well actually, but nobody points that out because the French were the baddies there), and also that nowadays we don't understand why the French were fighting there. At the time they considered Algeria like a part of France, but nowadays it doesn't seem right. Also, at the end of the war, the French left some Algerian people who supported and helped them in Algeria, where they got lynched and tortured.

You're right this could be a problem, but your solution to ignore any evidence and blindly equalise payment is ridiculous. You can't wish away inherited traits, at least not yet. If a condition makes someone a more risky driver then why should they be subsidised? Perhaps public transport would be a safer and cheaper approach, or some other alternative.

If that deposit guarantee scheme is unable to cover all deposits, that is just tough luck for savers, Iceland maintains.

In 2008, many European countries did however declare state guarantees on deposits, despite it being seemingly illegal under EU law, to prevent a run on the banks. As the entire banking sector in Iceland collapsed in a single week, the government there did declare a state guarantee on deposits based in Icelandic branches of Icelandic banks. That is probably an act of discrimination based on nationality and illegal under EU/EEA law, although possibly justified as an emergency measure.

You will never focus on all of them, monetary policy doesn't work like that it is a very blunt instrument. 

The downside to focusing on the biggest with the expectation that they help the poor is that in the case of the eurozone this was never explicitly told to voters. German voters were not told ""if the shit hits the fan be prepared to bail out the others"". It was expected that each country would run a responsibly economy which has led to...

&gt; This holier-than-thou attitude we see today, with Germans saying Greeks deserve to be punished and Greeks saying Germans are an occupying force

While I agree it is not helpful it is perfectly understandable. The Greeks (and others) did not reform their economies, they became over-reliant on cheap debt which they would never have got without the implicit support of Germany and spent money in an unsustainable way. 

10 years later, coming cap in hand to Germany and asking to be bailed out is a bit cheeky. In some respect the Greeks do deserve to be punished the evidence has been stacking up for years about how poor the Club Med economies have been performing relative to Germany and Norther Europe and this is because so many industries remain protected and unreformed. Corruption is pretty much systematic in some areas.

For me this is one of the defining reasons I am a Eurosceptic, it is not because I want it to fail but because of the blind idiocy of the populace and the politicians to even recognise conventional wisdom for currency unions and economic policy.  People really need to sit down and stop the political bullshit and have some honest and open conversations about what being a part of ""Europe"" means.

Either way my sympathies lie more with the German taxpayers because at the end of the day they will be the ones left holding the bill which needs paying.

FWIW if the EU got rid of the wasteful CAP and spent more wisely then perhaps that would give the Keynesian boost we need.",0,1325003248,null,0,false,0,c3bjvll,t3_nq7hl,t1_c3bjvll,t1_c3bir9x,1428082440,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt;In autumn 2009, by a popular initiative, a Constitution began to be drafted by citizen assemblies. In 2010, the Government proposed creating a national constitutional council whose members would be chosen by lot.

This is all true, this constitutional council was chosen in widely ignored elections (36% turnout in a country that usually sees a 85-90% turnout rate in national elections). Those elections were then invalidated by the Supreme Court for several technical faults in their execution. The representatives chosen in the elections were nevertheless appointed by the government to sit in a constitutional committee that would draft a new constitution. That draft is now complete and is pretty visionary in some ways. The ultimate fate of that work is far from clear. It is far from certain that this draft will be enacted as Iceland's new constitution.

&gt;Two referenda (the second in April 2011) refused to rescue the banks and pay the foreign debt.

The Icesave referendums had nothing to do with ""saving the banks"", they were about accepting or rejecting a deal made with the authorities of the UK and Netherlands about Iceland accepting responsibility for compensating certain depositors in the branches of a certain Icelandic bank based in those countries. It certainly wasn't a blanket statement of ""not paying foreign debt"".

I don't know about other countries, but in Germany we actually do have a little problem with censorship (both voluntary and by law) and political correctness, which do make it difficult to discuss the very real issues of migration. But unfortunately these issues are difficult to discuss and a lot of people that do cross the line and talk about it anyways call themselves heroes for disobeying the pc-code and then march right through the problem area into very fascist statements.

Spain is a huge country with millions of people. If you're familiar with travelling or living abroad, you simply can't go 100 miles per hour everyday, on trains, to new bars, etc. etc. etc. It's just not financially feasible. On top of that, I WORK in Spain. When you work 50 hours a week, some days when you come home all you want to do is lay in your bed and read a book, or play Battlefield 3 for an hour, or go to bed. There are many night where you are too tired to move, much less walk around, go to a bar, wait on a metro, pay for drinks, food, taxi, metro, on and on and on. 

I left all that stuff at home and lived there happily for over a month. I wasn't crying at night because I didn't have it. But, I'm going back for AT LEAST a year, probably more, and I would like to, by June, get my PS3 set up. It's just not fair to say to someone they're ""doing the country wrong"" because they want to play a video game two nights a week after working. Or watch a soccer game. Yeah, you can go to a bar and watch a soccer game cheap. But, I have no interest in doing that every single game. Especially when they don't play starters. I don't WANT to spend money or stay out till 11. I would like to watch it quietly in my home, enjoying my already paid for groceries, be able to hear the announcers, pay attention to the stats, etc. 

Are you really happy right now? Why don't you bash your computer in with a bat and stop using reddit? Will you look back on your life and be happy with your memories if all you did was occasionally use Reddit on a personal computer? Leave your computer in a garbage can and live in the moment, bro.

If the conclusion was the Southern economies were capable of the structural reform needed to overcome their sovereign debt problems it probably would have been better to visit less austerity upon them and for the Germans to endure some more inflation.

If the conclusion was the Southern economies were incapable, then sure it makes sense to make as much money as possible for as long as possible and then pick up the smallest tab possible when it comes.

The third conclusion could be that the Germans are good at making cars and dishwashers and that stuff but do not really ""get"" international money markets, global finance and the fundamentals of economics.

That's why they are expensive here... usually the ""exchange rate"" on electronics could be considered as 1€ = 1$. But we also have two-year warranty on everything, by law.

This TV seems like a cheap deal, at least for what I've seen:

Amazon.es is quite new and they haven't translated most of the specs in the products *sigh*, they are mostly imported from other countries where Amazon is (all of my orders have been shipped from France, Italy or Germany. I doubt they even have any warehouse in Spain). So, google the product name for info, and also check in Amazon.de/Amazon.it/Amazon.fr/Amazon.co.uk because the product+shipping might be lower than buying directly on Amazon.es (usually it isn't for some reason).

You can also go around electronic stores such as Mediamarkt and malls such as Alcampo, your mileage might vary. Be aware of cheap manufacturers as OKI, they often cause trouble.

What you need to see free-to-air TV is that the TV supports TDT (Televisión Terrestre Digital). If in doubt, search on the specs for DVB-T (the TDT standard name). It is also used on most of Europe if i'm not wrong, so it won't be very difficult. Most, if not all, of the TVs sold nowadays on shops are DVB-T compatible.

Also, take into account you can get at sites such as Dealextreme USB DVB-T dongles to see TV on your computer for cheap (~15$). They all support HD (despite what they say at the description, as the decoding is done by software and not hardware).

Anyway, be aware: Spanish TV sucks. Hard. We usually end up watching downloaded american TV series.

I seriously doubt that the average Joe understands what devaluing actually means in financial terms. I also doubt that most people understand why the crisis in Greece affect their own country. Furthermore I very much doubt that the general public understands why certain investments and projects might be a harsh road to take initially, but in the long run benefits the country.

I'm too tired/drunk to find any worthwhile arguments for my opinions right now. But asking the question: ""Would you vote for something that would affect your personal economy in a negative way?"" shows where the public stands IMHO.
