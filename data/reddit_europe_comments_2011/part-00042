That is the wrong way to look at it if you want to get any change done.  
Mostly because it's ethnically discriminatory and offers an unfair bias even towards those that do right in our system.  
  
The best way to solve problems is to not throw around the term gypsy when referring to the demographic we have in mind. Because not all ethnic gypsies contribute to the problem.

Still, what you're you're saying is a real concern. The last thing we (or Europe as a whole, for that matter) need is a populist anti-EU, anti-Muslim (the two often go together) party emerging in Germany. So far, we've been spared of this, partially due to our, let's say less than convincing, experience with populist parties, and partially due to the lack of a charismatic figurehead.

Im a foreigner married to a French woman and I moved to France.

Lille hands down. (I live in Lille).

Here is why:
* 1 hr from Paris by the TGV (you can take it directly at the CGD airport) and there is a train pretty much every hour.
* 1 hour from London by the EuroStar
* 45 minutes by EuroStar to Brussles
* 2 hours  (not sure which train) to Amsterdam.

So you are pretty much in the center of all these big cities.

The night life in Lille will beat the other 2 hands down. And if you want to push it further head across the border to Belgium (from Lille its about 30 minutes tops).

Lots of foreigners and lots of the locals do speak English. You can get by easily till you get comfortable with French.

Lots of concerts in and around Lille and in Brussles. 

Rent is not to bad in the center of Lille, I paid 600 for an awesome duplex with a terrance and parking not far frm the center. You can get a house in one of the suburbs for pretty much the same thing or less. Lille is very well connected by 2 metro lines and 2 tram lines, so you dont need a car really. (I have one which I use when im out with the wife and kid, if not its cycle + tram)

Cuisine - like is said Lille is very very multi cultural so you have an awesome choice.

Ive been to Rennes and Strasbourg. I would not move there for a higher pay. Unless its like a good 3000€ or 5000€ more than what I make now.

Message me if you have any questions.

For example, the various faculties of Uni Ulm will each host their own on campus party at some point during the school year. I had a lot of fun at those, but don't forget to buy tickets in advance, they sell out fast! The bar scene is also pretty good, and there are occasionally city-wide promotions or other events at the local bars (I remember one night where they had live music at almost every bar in town). I'm a beer person so my personal favorite place was the Barfüßer, but frankly it's pretty hard to go wrong with the bars in Ulm.

Being an international student, I got involved in the local Erasmus program which hosted a bunch of events and also introduced me to a bunch of other students. They also arranged trips to a bunch of the surrounding towns which helped me get my bearings a bit. I would definitely look in to that.

I am also a bit of an outdoors person but I didn't find much of that to do, at least not in the local vicinity. I took the train down to the alps and did my hiking there. Like most of Germany, there are plenty of bike paths and the one the goes along the Danube is especially pretty.

All that being said, Ulm is not Munich or Berlin and I think the population is less than 200,000 so it may seem a bit small in comparison to what you are used to. The good news is that both Stuttgart and Munich are less than 2 hours away by train so they make for easy day/weekend trips.

You're going to need to network your butt off and be very lucky to find that kind of situation.  

Enrolling as a student in a university is the other option.  That gives you a visa, and depending on its conditions, the ability to work part time.

Parking - not a problem at all in Lille. Ive never had to drive around for more than 3 minutes to find a spot.
The great thing about Lille is that its not as big as Paris or Lyon at the same time its not a tiny city with nothing to do. Its just the right size , so you don' end up getting stuck in traffic.

About the neighborhoods - got to watch it. Wazzemes is cool to visit and shop, they have one of the largest open air markets in France or western Europe, but I wont stay there. I had a colleague that did and it was not cool. Relatively poor neighborhood with lots of Arab and North African immigrants living there. Nothing wrong with them, but there tends to be some social issues and they(the ones from economically not so good situations) straight up don't like outsiders - this is just my observations and experiences. 

Vieux Lille is very beautiful, as the name goes its the old Lille. St. Maurice is just outside the center on the way to Tourcoing and Roubaix; Its on the tram line and about 4 or 5 stops from Lille center. 

If you are looking to stay in the center and have access to good night life, then here are your options :
* Carmontagne (a bit away from the center - cycling distance) and walking distance from Wazzemmes. i stayed here for a couple years. and liked it alot.
* Republic beaux arts
* along Rue National
* neighborhoods aound the Parc Citadel
* St. Maurice
* Vieux Lille
* St. Andre
* Lots of little quarters on the Tram Line - Brosollete, Romarain, etc.
* You can also look for places along the Tram and Metro lines as there are some nice neighborhoods and you can travel easily.

My best suggestions, what I did, was to look on websites where they announce houses for rent. pic as many as you can and make appointments before you actually get here. then find a hotel thats not to expensive. you can get a descent room for about 40 - 50 euro a night. get here and check out the neighborhood and visit the houses.
It took us about 4 days of traveling around and visiting places non stop. Its important to visit the neighborhood yourself and get a vibe for the place.

I recently found that near the Catholic University on rue National (i think) there is this student housing/service apartment kinda place. very nice studios for not to expensive. My in-laws spent a week there while visiting us. so you can work something out for a month or 2 while you decide.

If you have doubts or want to run something by me please don't hesitate. Ill be gone for a months (starting next week and back 2nd week of sept) on vacation, yes its a 1 month vacation (i love working in France) so not sure how often i will respond but if you are going to move here then probably get in touch by mail.

Feel free to dress up like ""a real German"", but if you decide to do so, go for authentic stuff.

Lederhosen or linen slacks, a red and white check shirt, and dark brown (suede) farmer shoes are good.

true,kindtim,null,null,"i'm marrying a madrileña next week, and i'm a goofy-looking blonde dude from california. here's my advice.

**numero uno:** don't make fun of her accent. i know it's cute, and if she's hot it's most likely incredibly sexy. in my experience, spanish women spend a lot of time working to learn english in institutions, and don't appreciate what they see as having their effort criticized. if she brings it up, try not to make a big deal about it.

**numero dos:** if you're ""liberal"", don't be afraid to be open about it. don't be afraid to be the ""sensitive guy"" or the ""nerd."" from what i hear from spanish women (and i risk getting downvoted for this suggestion) is that they are tired of guys playing themselves off as the macho warriors. i lived in spain for a year and impressed girls simply by listening, nodding, and making emphatic remarks. don't worry, they'll spare you the annoying girls stuff.

**numero tres:** just go with it. spanish women are super confident and more open and honest than any other nationality i have met. if she suggests doing something, she's serious about it. if she likes you, she will most likely be happy to partake in your suggestions. spur of the moment is great.

**numero cuatro:** the hot blooded stereotype is a myth. kind of. spanish women (and most southern european women i've met) are actually just very honest about their emotions. (this advice is probably more appropriate for later down the line.) if they're pissed off at you, they won't hesitate to tell you. if they think you're amazing, you will definitely find out. buuut if you're a gringo like me, you're used to passive aggressiveness, and sometimes this honesty can hurt or just seem awkward. just nod and admit ""i'm the worst"" if need be. in the end, i've come to appreciate this perspective on communication a thousand times more than people pretending to be happy or whatnot.

**numero cinco:** have some manners. be a gentlederp. close or cover your mouth when you eat. open doors for her.  my fiance is writing her phd thesis in women's studies and still appreciates chivalry. spanish women aren't afraid to be women.
