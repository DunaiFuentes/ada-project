I believe the bailout, and the terms of the bailout should help the people of Greece, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Ireland  fix their country - and not to make bankers richer (while bankrupting their economy)

Unbelievable, they're doing it again. Our governments are giving even more free taxpayer money to banks!


Absolutely, we need to bailout Greece to save Greece, and save Europe. But the current bailout makes us the taxpayers pay back banks for 90% of their foolish investments. Greek people don't get a cent, and we give a ton of money to rich bankers. And even worse -- about 30% of our money will go to speculators who will make a massive profit from gambling on a bailout!

How on earth did our governments write a bailout plan that floods banks and speculators with our money and leaves Greece with nothing? The answer -- they actually asked bankers to write the agreement. Our finance ministers are deciding on this plan in days -- let's send them and our parliaments a massive call to go back to the drawing board, and bailout Greece, not the banks.",0,1317752332,null,0,false,0,c2otjwz,t3_l0qyw,t1_c2otjwz,t3_l0qyw,1427685689,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

I do not know much about Avaaz, but here is some details regarding what they do:

There is some information on Wikilpedia discussing their campains.

I am not sure how succesful they are, but the more people speak up, and the more people that get involved, the more power they can have to bring issues to the fore.

ricordo solo una cosa... le adozioni ""nazionali"" non hanno nessun costo (qualche marca da bollo e basta)... poi se mi calcoli benzina e pernottamento per andare alle varie riunioni, girando le varie comunità e dalle famiglie adottive, beh... si... bisogna perdere soldi e tempo, ma quello serve a loro per testarti!!!
l'avvocato se prendi quello del tuo paese che non ha mai trattato un'adozione immagino che costi (ma se è onesto ti dice lui stesso cosa fare senza spendere),però ci sono le associazioni specifiche che fanno tutto l'iter ad un costo forfettario ""detraibile""!!!
se invece vai per adozioni ""internazionali"" in base al paese c'è un costo... non hai come qua in Italia dai 1 ai 3 anni di test (comunque non te lo danno subito nemmeno all'estero)... la cifra che spenderai non solo c'è la possibilità di usufruire di fondi appositi, ma anche se vuoi pagare di tasca tua sono detraibili!

sicuramente chi va per adottare un bimbo di massimo un anno, con capelli biondi, occhi azzurri, ecc... non tirerà fuori nulla... ti faccio l'esempio di una delle coppie che conosco, quella che ha avuto la bimba di un anno inizialmente stavano per adottarne una di 14 anni, anche perché avevano già dei figli loro e non volevano una grossa differenza di età... lui è un meccanico (il mio meccanico... e non ha una officina immensa... ha 2 banchi macchina per farti un'idea) e lei lavora in un maglificio a part-time! alla fine sono stati le assistenti della comunità a proporre di adottare una bimba così piccola e tutto l'iter lo hanno fatto loro!!! è vero che in tutte e tre le coppie che conosco si sono sempre prodigati a fare incontri e attività di gruppo con le altre famiglie adottive e lì bisogna dimostrare di essere all'altezza...

visto che ho dei contatti molto diretti con chi fa inseminazioni (che conoscono bene come la penso e mi confermano che non sono nemmeno loro contenti della situazione), ti posso dire che si parte da 4.000 euri (ma raramente basta una volta) sino ad arrivare a coppie che spendono dai 70.000 ai 180.000 euri.... e queste non sono cifre a caso ma di un centro piccoletto che conosco abbastanza bene!!!",0,1317773955,null,0,false,0,c2owxks,t3_kzb78,t1_c2owxks,t1_c2otonx,1427687282,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

&gt; 1 — Tour Eiffel

Yes and no. Yes, because it’s so iconic and you get a good grasp of the city’s geography from the top of it. No, because it’s a tourist thing, and if you can’t really wait 2-3 hours in line, it’s not really worth it. Last time I went, we went in the morning, we waited less than 20 minutes, but[ the view from the top was totally wasted towards the east, account the low sun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZb-CcEj9W4).

&gt; 2 — Le Louvre

The biggest museum in the world. You can spend weeks in there. If you have the stomach for it, [you can try to visit it in one day](http://emdx.org/rail/canard/France2010/E29nov.php) (luckily, I’ve been there plenty of times before), but in my opinion, that’s largely a waste of time.

&gt; 3 — Notre-Dame de Paris

Well worth it, it’s not too time consuming, or it can be just as you want it to be. Just to savour the medieval ambiance of the oldest part of the Cité. That’s the first thing I went to see the first time I ever was in Paris, 30 years ago. [And it’s a beautiful building anyways](http://emdx.org/rail/canard/France2010/France_20101125-154406_27825_NotreDameDeParis.jpg) (to think they called it «gothique» because it was deemed barbarian!!!).

&gt; 4 — Arc de Triomphe

[As iconic, yes](http://emdx.org/rail/canard/France2010/E26nov.php#AT). Worth the trip, and even more worth the ascent. The building itself is amazing in it’s construction, and the  halls inside are beautiful in their resplendent architectural simplicity. [And the view from the top is worth writing home about](http://emdx.org/rail/canard/France2010/France_20101126-145754_28185_PanoArcTriomphe.jpg).

&gt; 5 — Champs-Élysées

Just because it’s right next to the Arc de Triomphe. It’s just as beautiful as any other street in Paris, except that the other streets are not generally lined with the snobbish boutiques. The Louis Vuitton store has to be visited for the sensory experience and the cognitive dissonance ([and it even has a pirate flag on top!](http://emdx.org/rail/canard/France2010/France_20101126-154951_28318_LouisVuitton.jpg))

&gt; 6 — Musée d’Orsay

As I haven’t had the chance to go there, I just won’t comment, except to say that it would be a good idea to go there…

&gt; 7 — St-Sulpice

Been there 25 years ago. It’s not on the same level as the gothic cathedrals; worth the visit if only to compare the renaissance with the middle-ages (personally, I deem the abandonment of gothic architecture a technological regression).

But I’ll say to go visit the Sainte-Chapelle, too, [because it’s the absolute pinnacle of perfection in gothic architecture](http://emdx.org/rail/canard/France2010/E28nov.php). It is as revolutionnary as [Philip Johnson’s Glass House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_House) was 50 years ago.

&gt; 8 — Sacré-Cœur.

Don’t go there. It’s horrenduous. The building is ugly, and the motives for which it has been erected are far more uglier (the blood bath of the Commune massacre of 1871). You can, however, [enjoy the \(narrow\) view from the square in front of the basilica](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=48.88618,2.343178&amp;spn=0.001614,0.002873&amp;sll=48.863225,2.333729&amp;sspn=0.003046,0.00655&amp;hnear=Rue+Cambon,+75001+Paris,+%C3%8Ele-de-France,+France&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=48.88618,2.343178&amp;panoid=LKA0yaSu88HHqQh5AMUDVA&amp;cbp=12,159.88,,0,-8.24&amp;t=m&amp;z=19&amp;vpsrc=0), then wind down through Montmartre, the premier tourist trap of Paris (*caveat emptor!*).

&gt; 9 — Versailles.

Same comment as Musée d’Orsay, it’s the thing I keep saving for the next time.

&gt; 10 — Luxembourg.

Overrated. It's a big park and garden. Too formal to be any fun, and there are the senate guards in their strange square aquariums — how can a man accept to stand still for hours???, and far too close to the quartier latin, another proverbial tourist trap. If you want to see a real nice, wierd urban park, [go see the Buttes Chaumont park](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=48.879319,2.382848&amp;spn=0.006484,0.015578&amp;sll=48.863225,2.333729&amp;sspn=0.003046,0.00655&amp;hnear=Rue+Cambon,+75001+Paris,+%C3%8Ele-de-France,+France&amp;t=f&amp;z=17&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;ecpose=48.88344921,2.37505174,305.04,128.85,73.848,0) ([alternate link, in case the former doesn’t work](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=48.879319,2.382848&amp;spn=0.006484,0.015578&amp;sll=48.863225,2.333729&amp;sspn=0.003046,0.00655&amp;hnear=Rue+Cambon,+75001+Paris,+%C3%8Ele-de-France,+France&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;vpsrc=6)).

My stance on Paris: don’t take a subway pass, as much as the Métro can be attractive; the best way to experience Paris is to walk. Walk through the little streets, you will find plenty of strange and beautiful stuff that are not tourist traps. You’ll also find cafés and restaurants who don’t cater to the tourists, so you’ll have a more authentic experience. The waiters may be rude to you, just answer back in kind. 

Get yourself a good map book, and make sure you know how to use it, because you’ll get lost, as the streets wander all about. Walk as much as you can, and when you go from one place to the other, stray from the obvious path. If you’re really lost or late, then you can take the Métro. Buses can be interesting, too, but they are complicated to use (zone fares that do not correspond to the Métro’s zones) and can be mired in traffic.

Now if you have a subway pass, you’ll want to go on line 2 and line 6 (they make a big circle line), many portions of those lines are elevated, giving you an effortless visit of the city.

For lodging, the last time I went, I found a [cheap central B&amp;B on Craigslist](http://paris.fr.craigslist.fr/roo/).

They just react, they don't predict and when they do its hopeless guess work.

The overall issues for the Eurozone is not economic but political, you simply can not have a monetary union without a fiscal union. The Eurozone countries will soon have to decide what is the end game for the European Union. Are we going to take a big step forward toward political union or a big step back and see the end of European unity for at least another generation?

I suspect that over the next 12 months we will see the introduction of Eurobonds rather than individual countries going to the markets, we will see some form of debt forgiveness across the Eurozone and we will see steps towards a fiscal union rather than just a monetary union.

You need to remember that this is the first major challenge that the Eurozone has had to face since its inception, its suffering from growing pains but that's all it is.

Freddie Mac and Fannie May have always been effectively nationalised.  They were essentially backed by the US Government, so it was always going to be the case that they'd have a AAA rating.

Further, there's two separate issues here: banks were creating instruments so complicated, and specifically designed to game the rating agencies, that they'd be given AAA ratings.  Countries cannot do this, unless you're trying to claim that Italy's situation is even worse than what the current ratings claim it is.

&gt; The overall issues for the Eurozone is not economic but political, you simply can not have a monetary union without a fiscal union.

It's ridiculous to try to separate the two like you are doing.  The Eurozone is in bad economic straits with half of Southern Europe in absolute turmoil.  The reason why it is so is because:

  * the Euro is a silly, silly idea
  * Eurozone politicians have consistently bungled any chance of settling the markets that they come across.  Even with the rest of the world crying out for a little bit of leadership, Eurozone politicians are setting deadlines of months in advance for them to even to have a *plan*.  Markets react overnight.  Eurozone politicians seemingly react over the course of a few months.

I believe there was some kind of misunderstanding. A fuse box shouldn't be locked, it should be in a box/behind a door/somehow hidden right in your apartment. 

You also don't call an electrician just for a blown fuse, replacing one is just as ""hard"" (and ""expensive"") as replacing a light bulb. A fuse costs about 2€ and it just screws in. In most cases you don't even have a fuse but a breaker, so you just push in button/flip a switch and you are back in business.

Eating in Paris - you need to explore and to get off the beaten track to find the good places . Food in France is good ( except touristy areas in central Paris , takeaway rubbish and motorway service area rubbish ) .

The trick with French food is to avoid the brasseries and to go for the traditional restaurants . In Paris : [Le Brasier](http://www.lebrasier.net/) - Place Adolphe Max \ Rue de Bruxelles ( just south of the Moulin Rouge - Pigalle ) ; [Le Basilic](http://www.restaurant-le-basilic.abcsalles.com/prive/fr/fiche.php?n=13438) - Rue Joseph de Maistre \ Rue Lepic \ Rue des Abbesses - Montmartre Butte ; [L'Entre Mer](http://www.restaurant-lentremer.fr/) - galettes - Place des Impressionnistes - Rueil Malmaison ; [Creperie, Moulerie Larcher](http://www.creperie-moulerie-larcher.fr/) - 9 &amp; 11 rue Saint-Pierre - Saint-Germain-en-Laye . There is a good restaurant about 5mins South of the Musée d'Orsay - I think it is [Le Drop Café](http://www.ledropcafe.fr/)  .

true,jb2386,null,null,"I studied in Konstanz for a year. It's a university town down on the border with Switzerland (you can walk over the border, too! pretty neat for someone like me coming from Australia where such a thing is literally impossible!)

It's a bloody beautiful place, and I had A LOT of fun. University towns are awesome if you're looking for nightlife. I think in bigger cities, the student nightlife becomes diluted with the city nightlife. Depends what you want really. 

I had friends from Australia that went over with me, but studied in Tuebingen and they loved it there (though watch out for the hills!). It's another beautiful town, it's bigger than Konstanz, but still had a cool student vibe.

Getting around the state is pretty easy. You can buy day tickets that cost about 30 euro and you can split that ticket from 2 to 5 people, so in the end it's just a few euro to get to another city/town. :)

The accent is very different and they have their own dialects. Depends on where you go but you'll hit up badisch and/or schwaebisch. Most people are good with hochdeutsch though, they just love their sccchhh sounds when there is a 'st'. So for me I'd hear Konschtanz all the time, but a north German would make it a harsh 'st'.

Baden-Wuerttemberg is pretty cool overall. The south of the country is pretty much divided into Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bayern. So they're still pretty conservative when compared to north Germany, but everyone is lovely.

The weather where I was, was generally pretty good. Though Konstanz is on the Bodensee (biggest lake in Germany) and that likes to keep the weather more stable (warmer during winter, cooler during summer) than other places. 

The only time I interacted with police was when they were called to shut down our parties, and it depends on the officer, though I normally got away pretty quickly ;) I did see them get pretty abusive against a French friend and we filed a complaint against it -- I think they just get tired of the students sometimes.

Also, my favourite beer from Germany also comes from Baden-Wuerttemberg: Rothaus. You can go take a tour of the brewery (it's the ""state brewery"").

It's fine, I lived in Stuttgart.  Even big cities in Germany have plenty of green space.  The forests are fantastic in the whole state.  There is a ton of outdoor activities if you like rambling, cross-country skiing, biking, etc.

City life is completely different from the typically-designed US city; and public transport is clean and efficient. There are a lot of modern ideas in architecture, food, literature and technology in BW and across the whole country.

There are rituals and processes just like in US culture.  Take note of them and follow along and you'll be happier.  Shopping hours, coffee and cake at 1500 on Sunday in someone's house, don't be too late, etc.

The Schwab accent will take some getting used to if you have studied High German in the US.  But the media (news, weather, traffic) will use it in BW so you should be all right to get the important info.

It was surprisingly cold in S-Rohr; the snow was packed on the road for four months in the winter.  This differed from other places I lived in Germany (Bayern, RP).  

Didn't do the nightlife but it was robust in the cities.  Lots of unique pubs catering to the entirety of classes/interests, from blue-collar beer bars to wine sniffing and clubs playing the latest music.

Germans are now world-travelers who bring back a lot of foreign influences so it's not going to be all Fachwerk houses and potato soup anymore; the whole country is pleasantly multicultural, smart and world-savvy.  The pockets of parochialism have shrunk dramatically since I was a kid in Oberbayern in the 1960s.

The police are fine but in my experience formal.  Be nice, and never lie to them.  You want to know the local norms and not exceed them AT ALL.  You can't talk your way out of much, so just be honest; if you've screwed up admit it.  Germany is not a police state despite the stereotype and the police are a lot more forgiving (uncaring?) about your actions than an American might know from dealing with American cops.  American cops are taught to control a situation; it seems like German cops are taught to de-escalate a situation.  That said, if push comes to shove, German cops can shove a lot harder (though they seem to also be taught not to shoot so quickly).

BW is relatively wealthy, and mainly dominated by it's car industry (Daimler and Porsche in Stuttgart, Audi in Neckarsulm). The rest of the country is relatively rural, but not poor. People tend to be rather conservative, and it might get hard to get into touch with the locals if you are not living in one of our cities (which are mainly Stuttgart, Karlsruhe and Mannheim). Nightlife is mainly limited to these cities (and places with universities), too.

BW is great for hiking, and we do believe our public transit system might be a little shakey, but still a lot better than the rest of Germany.

Cost of living is above average, but income is so, as well.

Be prepared for every patch of land having it's own ""Mundart"" (dialect), which might be close to unparsable. This is, however, mainly limited to older people. There still is a lot of positive rivalry between the peoples of different areas (Mainly the Schwaben, the Badener, the Württemberger, the Alemannen and the Unterfranken, with subfactions of their own, e.g. the Hohenloher) - nothing violent, more like a mock disdain for each other.

EU needs a mechanism or a body to deal with these problems, where countries can apply for loans  -  and not rely on the banks    (What the Greek govt has done the their own banking sector, never mind the EU banks is criminal).

And the interest on the loans should not be so punitive that they alone bankrupt the country (while providing speculators with profit opportunities).

Are you planning to employ people or work mostly solo? Could you just be a French registered auto-entrepeneur? I know a few English people who operate like that.

I know that Gordon Gekko made greed glamorous, but I dont find any redeeming qualities in that trait. 
 A quote from Josh Billings emphasises this point about greed -  Avarice is like a graveyard; it takes all that it can get and gives nothing back.  You cant channel greed.  

  Greed is what fucks up capitalism.   If that trait did not exist in humans, capitalism  would be the ideal system.

Here are some little advices for people who wanna have fun in Paris, and have a real parisian experience, not the postal card fake experience.

First, hang out one thursday in Jussieu, on the border of Seine (stop at Austerlitz station) and have a picnic there. a lot of ppl from everywhere, students, salsa, faluchards, well, people who love to have fun and meet others. you can continue and visit the Seine small islands.
You want to see Paris from the top? dont go to Montparnasse tower, it's shit. Use the balloon in André Citroen Park. much more fun! 

If you wanna see and get explanations about Paris monuments, take a ferry boat! It's really pleasant and peaceful. A company also offer [a tour in an old french car, the famous 2 chevaux](http://www.parisauthentic.com/), and this is something. Walk your ass to montmartre, see the sacre coeur of course, but go by the steps, its much more fun and you see the real Paris. Enter a sex shop in Pigalle. Stay for the evening in one of the excellent pub they have here. 

Then go to the ""L'internationale"" bar with live concerts in the basement. Around are a lot of other pubs that you may like. 

Near Notre Dame, find the Jazz/piano bar on a boat.

If you go to places like your top 10 places to see, you will have the same experience as other tourists before and after you. Is this really what you want? Talks to people, ask them for advices, in the streets, in the shops, in a pub.

From what my wife says, your university experience might be different here in Germany. With students paying only 500 euros a semester, there is a different approach to education. Classes might be harder to get into, less staff to help you along, and the students have less of a say in their own education.

**Eating Out**

Eating in Paris - you need to explore and to get off the beaten track to find the good places . Food in France is good ( except touristy areas in central Paris , takeaway rubbish and motorway service area rubbish ) .

The trick with French food is to avoid the brasseries and to go for the traditional restaurants . In Paris : [Le Brasier](http://www.lebrasier.net/) - Place Adolphe Max \ Rue de Bruxelles ( just south of the Moulin Rouge - Pigalle ) ; Le Basilic - Rue Joseph de Maistre \ Rue Lepic \ Rue des Abbesses - Montmartre Butte ; [L'Entre Mer](http://www.restaurant-lentremer.fr/) - galettes - Place des Impressionnistes - Rueil Malmaison ; [Creperie, Moulerie Larcher](http://www.creperie-moulerie-larcher.fr/) - 9 &amp; 11 rue Saint-Pierre - Saint-Germain-en-Laye . There is a good restaurant about 10mins South of the Musée d'Orsay .

**The Suburbs - Les Banlieue**

1) Rueil Malmaison - visit the town - about a 15 min. walk from the RER train station , and visit the Malmaison - where Napoleon and Josephine lived and where Josephine almost bankrupted Napoleon doing the place up whilst he was away fighting his wars . Rueil has a very good Saturday market . During the summer holidays some of the shops are closed down for their annual summer holiday - they take turns over July , August , September . The Seine , Ile des Impressionnistes and restaurants are close to the station - in the opposite direction to the town - on the other side of the village .

2) St. Germain-en-Laye . It's an expensive area and is a dormitory area for Paris Central . It has a Museum and Parc and shops . It is also a good place to go in the evening - good restaurants etc. .

3) The suburbs to the SW - Versailles etc. - and the NW .

The French have a good work life balance so there are always plenty of things to see and do . Check on the local websites for information .

Be careful where you go . The arrondisements are better than the NE suburbs ( which can be positively dangerous ). The Western suburbs are good from Nanterre down and up to the NW - Cergy , Pontoise etc. and into Yvelines . Suggest avoid NE Nanterre and Colombes .

Incidentally , if you see an area to the West that has a lot of tall modern buildings that is La Défense - Puteaux - it is a business area and also has the main train station for the Western suburbs and has a couple of shopping centres and a small town area to the South .

**Travelling**

Getting to Paris - [Eurostar](http://www.eurostar.com/) or [Easyjet](http://www.easyjet.com/) . Or by car - [Eurotunnel](http://www.eurotunnel.com/) .

Travelling around Paris - [on foot](http://www.parisapied.net/) &amp; [à pied](http://www.gr-infos.com/grp-paris1.htm) etc. and [Paris Visite](http://parismetro.tourpackagers.com/detail1.aspx?id=19) ( also works on the [Sacre Coeur funicular](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thilek/4901686779/) ) - the [Metro](http://www.ratp.fr/) &amp; [RER](http://parisbytrain.com/) .

**The Language**

Firstly as we grow up we construct phonetic and gramatical filters and auto correctors . These get in the way . The older we get the harder it is .

French is a very vowel based sounding language . It does not have the clear consonant endings that English has .

The French pronounce the whole word except often the end . The English skip over the middle - just say er - and pronounce the end .

The English pronounce strongly or softly . The French pronounce in the middle of the mouth - towards the back - it's a more moderate and nasal sound .

A lot of the French vowel sounds do not have direct English equivalents but they do have similar English equivalents. oi - wa . au - o . oui - we , u - oo . j is soft . g can be hard or soft . th is pronounced with the t &amp; the h separately , the h is often silent . In England there is a town called Witham pronounced wit ham - this is more the French pronunciation . Plural is indicated by the prefixing word - preposition - le \ la ( the ) becomes les ( lay ) , de ( of , from ) becomes des ( day ) ( of plural , some ) . Plural nouns end in s or x but the s or x are not pronounced . If x is in a word - eg Bruxelles - it's pronounced as a s . Consonants preceding vowels may be transferred to the vowel - c'est un - becomes - c'es tun in sound , if the un wasn't there it would be just c'e in sound . ~tion is pronounced ~seeon .

Instead of 'it is' the French usually say 'this is' - c'est . are and have become interchanged - eg. in English - 'what age are you ?' - in French 'I have 51 years' - J'ai 51 ans . The French language can often be formal - please is s'il vous plait - if it pleases you . They also often use contractions both on the English and on the French - 'I am an engineer' becomes 'I am engineer' - Je suis ingenieur , toute de suite becomes toute suite . They can also say things that sound odd to the English ear - 'merci a vous' - 'thanks to you' instead of thank you . Often the basic noun verb noun sentence is said noun noun verb - 'I send you' becomes 'I you send' - 'Je vous envoie' . The French do not have a word for 'do' , they use the word for 'make' - 'faire' - and they don't use it as a question indicator . A question is stated Australian style but without the do . They also don't have a word for 'will' in the sense of 'I will send you to Paris' they say 'Je vais vous envoyer à Paris' - literally - 'I go you sending to Paris' . Past is the word 'have' - 'J'ai ...' . Where the French end the word in '~ment' there is almost always an English equivalent word ending in '~ly' with almost always the same meaning . Where the English end a word in '~ing' the French just use the verb base - er or re ending - ie. the 'to ~verb' . Possessives are said using the word 'de' - 'boy's dog' is 'dog of boy' - 'chien de garcon' . Adjectives often follow the nouns - 'blue car' is 'car blue' - 'voiture bleue' . The French often use 'on' - one - instead of 'nous' - we .

Now , learning French . I suggest 3 hours basic French course per week over at least 3 weeks . Then just use it when you are in Paris - eg. in restaurants , buying tickets etc. - just pleasantries - la politesse . Be warned Paris has a strong tourist sector that is not the best place to learn and practice French . It's like any such tourist sector - a lot of non French working in it , along the central drag there is a quite a bit of bad service and a fair bit of bad food etc. . IE. you have to know where to go to find the good food and good service - getting off the beaten track is , as always , the good way to go.

Actually, nobody payed a penny for it (well, maybe the EU budget's contribution was payed, not sure); you just gave it guarantees that were it to incur any losses, you'd cover your proportional share of them. It gets its capital from selling its own AAA bonds, then giving that money at a lowish interest to troubled economies as a loan. If any of those were to default to those loans too, rather than just private debt, only then you'd need to cover the difference between that loss and profit made by borrowing to other countries that didn't default.

The fact your government choose to implement austerity measures is not correlated - partly this makes sense because Germany looked like having gotten out of the crisis so stimulus wasn't necessary, and one's supposed to save during good times to be able to spend in the future. Your debt level is beyond the required 60%. Partly its just ideology doing this prematurely and too sharply, with the undesirable consequences of dragging down growth everywhere, since it damages spending power already too low in Germany.

Europe is a substantially integrated economy already; this doesn't even have much to do w eurozone (apart from making it easier for capital markets to be integrated), but with the more basic structure - the single market. And the level of integration is constantly rising (new reform of the single market act is currently underway).

And, actually, in a really integrated economy, its true that your companies can take the jobs elsewhere, but the workers too can go to where the jobs are better payed, which raises the cost of labor from where they left. It needn't be equal for this to be a loosing proposition to the company considering this - because workers in more developed economies have higher productivity, possibly due to better infrastructure and more skilled labor.  So the important thing is simply for an economy to be competitive in the relevant market. Germany definitely is, being an exporter.

Though the differences in the corporate tax regime might be a dangerous thing here - but soon an optional regime of a unified calculation of the corporate tax base - not rates - is to be introduced. This would be advantageous choice to companies operating in a couple of countries, not having to keep totally separate books for each. Though rates would initially vary, currently one can excuse this because they're not directly comparable since what is taxed also differs, so a higher nominal rate might be applied to a smaller base. But I'd expect with a unified tax base there'd be more pressure to convergence of tax rates too over time.",0,1317924339,null,0,true,0,c2pe414,t3_l191k,t1_c2pe414,t1_c2pcnup,1427695523,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

your grammar here looks a bit off, so I'm not quite sure what you're saying. However, what I described is exactly how EFSF works to the best of my knowledge; I think you're misinformed here. Regarding any transfers of money outside of EFSF, that's a different matter - I explicitly replied to your claim that *""we paid in tax increases for this ESEF monstrosity""* , which is simply false, nobody ever payed a penny for EFSF.

Now If you mean the initial Greek bailout package, yes that isn't a part of the EFSF (which you mentioned, not me), and in that case I think you're right that these are simple bilateral loans done from the budgets. I don't know what effect, if any, currently given loans in this package had on the budgets though. But I do remember Merkel announcing 'tough austerity' when this had nothing to do with economic fundamentals, just to 'lead by example', and perhaps because Germany was exiting the crisis so she just thought it was a good time to implement this preexisting agenda.

But you repeat the falsehood here again - no loans EFSF gives will ever mean Germany or any other country needs to pay a penny, since EFSF raises its own capital on the markets - until and unless a country defaults on such a loan. And yes, EFSF is already giving loans, to Portugal and Ireland, so its not true it hasn't been used (if that's what you're saying):

http://www.efsf.europa.eu/about/operations/index.htm

(€2.2 b to Portugal on 29/06/2011, further €3.7 billion on 22/06/2011, and €3.6 billion to Ireland on 01/02/2011)

financed exactly as I described - by placing bonds, see this news for eg

http://www.efsf.europa.eu/mediacentre/news/2011/2011-010-efsf-places-3-billion-bond-in-support-of-portugal.htm

""Luxembourg – European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) today placed a €3 billion bond with a 5 year maturity to fund the EFSF’s second disbursement as part of the financial assistance package to Portugal.""

""Distribution was well diversified globally, thus highlighting EFSF’s broad appeal to high quality investors. As anticipated and in line with previous transactions, demand was particular strong from Asia with a notable €550 million from the Japanese Ministry of Finance.

The funds will be disbursed to Portugal on 29 June (five business days settlement). This corresponds to Portugal’s request for a loan of around €2.2 billion1.""


here's a bit from wiki on how it works:

""The EFSF can issue bonds or other debt instruments on the market with the support of the German Debt Management Office to raise the funds needed to provide loans to eurozone countries in financial troubles, recapitalize banks or buy sovereign debt.[5] **Emissions of bonds would be backed by guarantees** given by the euro area member states in proportion to their share in the paid-up capital of the European Central Bank (ECB).""

""If there is a request from a euro area member state for financial assistance, it will take three to four weeks to draw up a support programme including sending experts from the Commission, the IMF and the ECB to the country in difficulty. Once the Eurogroup have approved the country programme, the **EFSF would need several working days to raise the necessary funds** and disburse the loan.[7]""

""The table below shows the current maximum level of joint and several guarantees given by the Eurozone countries. The amounts are based on the European Central Bank capital key weightings. EU has requested the Eurozone countries to approve an increase of the guarantee amounts to €780 billion. **The majority of the risk** of the proposed increase from €440 billion **would fall** on the AAA rated countries and **ultimately their taxpayers, in a possible event of default** of the investments of EFSF. .""

""The first **bonds of the European Financial Stability Facility were issued** on 25 January 2011. The EFSF placed its inaugural five-year bonds for an amount of €5 billion as part of the EU/IMF financial support package agreed for Ireland.[19] The issuance spread was fixed at mid-swap plus 6 basis points. This implies borrowing costs for EFSF of 2.89%. Investor interest was exceptionally strong, a record breaking order book of €44.5 billion, i.e. about nine times the supply. Investor demand came from around the world and from all types of institutions.[20] The Facility chose three banks (Citibank, HSBC and Société Générale) to organise the inaugural bonds issue.[21]""


and this is from EFSF's own FAQ:

""The EFSF would **provide loans by issuing bonds** or other debt instruments **guaranteed** by euro area Member States. In the Greek package euro area Member States provide bilateral loans which are pooled by the European Commission and then paid out in
tranches to the Greek government. Together with financial aid from the IMF the support for Greece reaches €110 billion.""


&gt;Language barriers exist. 

agreed, it is a fundamental problem. But there are also many other barriers to such movement of labor that are a matter of more easily fixable problems. (healthcare, social security, pension transfers, recognition of qualifications for eg. ). Still at least a portion of skilled labor does speak some European language other than their own, and hopefully this will increasingly be the case. The cases you suggest (italy -&gt; hungary etc) are exactly the opposite ones of those relevant to making a company not be able to easily flee to a country w worse labor laws. Quite a few Eastern Europeans do speak German or English for eg (and also there are jobs outside the obvious countries that can be had w merely such knowledge), and they needn't go to any particular area outside their country to influence the price of labor home.

Movement of labor isn't as trivial even in a fully integrated country, so this needn't be worse.

&gt;especially considering this will eventually lead to a situation where people will have to move every other years, following companies around.

now this is just nonsense; what this means is simply that a competitive equilibrium is established by having a minor part of the labor force move in one way, since this influences the cost of labor in the country they leave, until such an equilibrium is (roughly) reached.

This is a very interesting question, what does Germany have to gain. With a single representative government controlling a population of over 300 million, the Eurozone would achieve greater buying power and increased economies of scale.  Now you might say that this certainly does not offset the cost of paying off other coutries' debt, and you would be right.

So this brings us back to the question of who controls this government.  I originally thought that the prospering nations of the Eurozone (positive account balance) would have the majority of say within the government.  With this solution, the means to make the debt-incurring countries behave would be taken care of.

However, boq pointed out that this violates democratic principles.  Each nation in the Eurozone, regardless of economic success, must have an equal say in government.  Under this logic, the means to make the debt-incurring countries is lost significantly.

no reasonable way? Have you seen the so called '6 pack' measures? Commission can fine misbehaving countries now, and even large countries like France, Italy, Germany will find it very difficult to stop themselves being so fined if they break the rules. 

Though this is more about the stability of the economic sphere than about 'paying for other's debts' - because nobody forces you to pay for any debts, your politicians simply think that in an integrated financial market, it is cheaper and less risky to bailout few large government actors, than to let them default and try patching up their own banks who took wild risks in buying other ppl's debts (mega-Lehman Brothers scenario) - or at least postpone events for a while to give markets the chance to orderly adapt to the expected losses. And you accepted these debts under strict reform conditionality, and can refuse any further whenever unsatisfied with performance.. Makes sense to me - if and only if you pay for something, you get to dictate terms.

Absolute nonsense; EU has fortunately avoided a UNSC-like structure you propose, in favor of a parliamentary-elected 'government' independent of any national influences.

It should continue to be guided by this 'community method'.

Now as far as polling debt goes, a simple solution is a super-majority vote in proportion to your capital share, similar to how ECB works, for any issuance of joint debt. Though it will surely start as a unanimous vote like current EFSF (which really is a kind of joint issuance of debt, and is getting much more flexible about when it can be used soon). And in either case, imho joint debt should be capped by Maastricht criteria, senior to any further national debt, and not given even to that extent to any country in breach of SGP obligation (as determined by Comission and revokable only by a reverse qualified majority vote (ie supermajority), like other SGP fines work now - or even just an automatic consequence of being imposed a fine by this procedure, to simplify matters).

In general, I'd suggest it's a pretty good idea to vacate the area if NATO troops are shooting you with rubber bullets. Serbians can protest northern Kosovo being a region of the Republic of Kosovo all they want, but direct action isn't really a viable option in an area that most of Europe feels it has a responsibility to stop war and violence in.

Don't get me wrong, I know the position of the EU on non-EU countries isn't always perfect, but in general good intentions lie behind EU actions. Romania and Bulgaria are doing pretty well out of the EU, I don't really see how you can say otherwise. Bulgaria for instance has been at times receiving 25% of their GDP again from the EU in structual and other funding. You can hardly call that doing badly. If corrupt politicians are squandering that money, it's the duty of the citizens of that country to solve that problem, not of the EU.

I suppose that's what it boils down to really. If you really don't want EU experts visiting your country, giving you lots of money, then you need to change your politicians.

It will hardly come to a halt because UK dislikes it - the institutional framework is already in place, so they can't block enhanced cooperation about it.

There is prob no need to integrate much more than such more-or-less rapid reaction forces, beyond more standardization of stuff and capability/training to act jointly, only partially done by NATO,  and common procurements (which EDA already covers) , since countries have a time to decide and act, as well as resources for separate command. There are some capabilities that are lacking though for any country...

The point is not to duplicate NATO - this isn't necessary, since a (somewhat weaker) 'aid' clause like common defense in NATO is already part of the Lisbon treaty. But precisely to remove many remaining duplications of effort that make the European military more expensive for its real capacity than it need be.

Not that there wasn't any racism in France at the time (indeed there was plenty) but a black person could sit in a café and order a drink and be served by a white man, for example. 

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans_in_France): 
&gt;Paris saw the beginnings of an African-American community in the aftermath of World War I when about 200,000 were brought over to fight. Ninety per cent of these soldiers were from the American South. Many black GIs decided to stay in France after having been well received by the French, and others followed them. France was viewed by many African Americans as a welcome change after incidents of racism in the United States. It was during this time that jazz was introduced to the French and black culture was born in Paris. African American musicians, artists, and Harlem Renaissance writers found 1920s Paris ready to embrace them with open arms. Montmartre became the center of the small community, with jazz clubs such as Le Grand Duc, Chez Florence and Bricktop's thriving in Paris. World War II brought all the fanfare to an abrupt halt. The Nazi invasion of Paris in June 1940 meant suppression of the ""corrupt"" influence of jazz in the French capital and danger of imprisonment for African Americans choosing to remain in the city. Most Americans, black as well as white, left Paris at this time.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;That was a macroeconomic measure that was of little consequence to the citizens as long as average wealth was increased. Now, we pay, with wealth decreasing.

Uhm, Germany's wealth (GDP) is growing at a quite comfortable pace, 2.9%, despite the fact its an export-oriented economy and hence dependent on the state of world , the state of which is anything but good.

And yeah, macroeconomic measures always have a price, just because its not budgeted doesn't make it free. Well even disregarding that, even mark was never as inflation-free and hence even Germany never had as cheap borrowing costs or stable prices as euro does. 

And ofc, who but an exporter country profits from having no currency exchange risks and costs towards their most significant trading partners? 

And, the only thing you might be paying is having Merkel's austerity measures for no good reason. And perhaps her ad-hoc over-the-weekend rescue agreements rather than making the proper institutions that eventually were forced upon her anyway - which won't include any risks of anyone actually having to pay anything, unless **all** private creditors were already completely defaulted to - ie got nothing at all, and this was still not enough (this being due to seniority). Which is a situation politicians would hardly be able to accidentally walk into - this would mean the loans given to them by the facility would themselves need to be some obscene % of GDP.

&gt;Exactly. It is an example on how large our ""influence"" really is.

well, how large is it supposed to be? This is a world of giants like US, Russia, China, India etc - why would one Germany individually have much say?

&gt;I leave it for you to decide how much sense it makes to apply a monetary fine to someone already deep in debt and ""forced"" to go in deeper.

Well, granted some form of political sanctions would be better, but also more difficult to implement in short notice, since this requires treaty change. Hopefully in the future the Court of Justice will be able to rule against such countries, too.

But this being better by no means implies the current measures aren't a 'reasonable way' as you say, to enforce discipline. Its a good deterrent measure, and it's not the first response (warning, recommendation &amp; compliance monitoring, interest bearing deposit, non-interest bearing deposit, fine), the sum is neither excessive nor ignorable (0.2% GDP, possibly incurred multiple times with repeated non-compliance). 

Sure, I don't see anything at all problematic in making life even more miserable than it already is to a country that has totally ignored its obligations, warnings, recommendations etc but drags the rest of the eurozone further 

Though to be fair, these measures should come into effect much before they would be particularly counterproductive, since w the '6 pack' measures, the total debt, rather than just deficits as before, will also be looked at, and corrective measures need to be taken if its above 60% - something Germany is currently not fulfilling either. And, with a smaller potential penalty, countries lagging in competitiveness can be warned/required to reform in certain ways/assessed/forced to make a deposit/fined even if they're for now ok in terms of debt and deficit (Ireland was such a case for eg).

Perhaps, though I think they're right in avoiding another, bigger, very messy meltdown of financial markets but rather sinking it in cash right at the source. In either case, my point was a different one: namely that there is nothing at all forcing Germany to participate in any bailouts, except its assessments, correct or no, of its self-interest, as a consequence of a burst of a bubble its banks participated in.

Because, were it not to have rescued Greece, given the state of the banks at the time (they may be more easily to handle now, markets expect a default anyway, a mechanism to rescue them even in countries that can't afford to like Italy is in place etc, so the talk is recapitalization is to happen soon) , this would just mean more German banks going bust, since a large proportion of Greek debt was a risky decision made by German banks. So, they'd need to patch up those, or even more mess happens downstream (etc). 

So, instead, they (&amp;others) give money to the Greeks, and they in turn give money to repaying their loans to German (etc) banks. Apart from the mess not doing so at least for some time makes, there's little to gain.",0,1317971967,null,0,true,0,c2pk5jf,t3_l1qic,t1_c2pk5jf,t1_c2pizby,1427698441,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,Deusdies,EART,Earth,"&gt; and NATO says that northern Kosovo is a region of the Republic of Kosovo, along with most other democracies in the world.

NATO has no authority to say if a country should be recognized or not. NATO is just a military force - nothing more. Furthermore, both NATO and EU military presently there have agreed to take neutral stance on the issue. 

&gt; In general, I'd suggest it's a pretty good idea to vacate the area if NATO troops are shooting you with rubber bullets. Serbians can protest northern Kosovo being a region of the Republic of Kosovo all they want, but direct action isn't really a viable option in an area that most of Europe feels it has a responsibility to stop war and violence in.

Agreed. I am half from Kosovo (my mom is from Kosovo) but I'm a realist: I wish our government would let go of Kosovo already. It's 95% Albanian and its living standard is 10 times lower than that of Serbia. It has been the poorest region of Serbia before the war(s), and it is especially the poorest region right now. 

However the elections are coming up and no one is brave enough (and I understand this) to come out and say it. Our best bet right now is to split Kosovo in half, which is still actually a viable option.

&gt; Don't get me wrong, I don't like the idea of any military shooting any civilians, but Serbians really have to understand that from the perspective of most of Europe, they're the bad guys. I'm not endorsing this view as I understand that the politics of the early 90's were really screwed up and mostly dominated by those who held onto or grabbed power in the wake of the USSR, but nevertheless it remains the case that any sort of aggressive direct action by Serbians is going to be viewed in a poor light by most of Europe. In short, if you've got arguments to make, parliaments and the media are the place to make them, not the streets.

Again agreed. I keep telling people that we must understand that we're viewed as the shithole of Europe. The first war in the XX century Europe started in Serbia - the last war in the XX century Europe ended in Serbia. There still hasn't been a single generation of people in Serbia that has not gone through the war - all thanks to idiotic political leaders generally (however something about ""the Balkans being the bridge between the east and the west"" is relevant too). If you were to come to Serbia, you'd realize that Serbs are actually very nice people.

This is something I've heard but never understand. I usually hear it from tourists about people in Paris when they try to utter two words in French, and they think French people speak English because their hotel concierge and waiter did. But you, you've been here 2 1/2 years you say. Not to be rude, but how bad is your French? Because the French aren't very good at English (generalizing, young people are better than the rest on average). So is your French that bad, or French people's English around you so good?

Your main problem is your last sentence: you speak English 90% of the time. That is the real culprit here, the lack of immersion. It's easy to get lazy and complacent and just hang out with anglophones or French people who speak English. You need to join some associations (even linguistic exchanges) and get out and meet real French people who don't know and don't care about English. If you don't force yourself, obviously no one is going to do it for you! Especially the French people who like to hang around you for the free English lesson and practice the new vocab they heard on Dr. House and How I Met Your Mother.

We could go on, but I'm sure your family life/job also involves English thus you have fewer and fewer natural outlets.

Lets say a farmer (Government) owns a farm and the neighborhood has some wolves that attack his sheep. So to protect the farm he builds a very nice fence around his farm and the only way to get in is though the gate. Since then there are no attacks on his sheep.

Now the farmer dies and his son takes over. The farmers son decides since there are no attacks since the fence was built by his dad (over a few decades) there is no need any more for the fence.

The day after the fence is removed he see's that most of his sheep have been killed by the wolves.

Lehne ich entgegen der Meinung anderer Ärzte eine Therapie ab und dies abzuwägen und der Homöopath hat darauf keine Einfluss sieht die Sache natürlich anders aus.

true,peetss,null,null,"The Greek government is in disarray, and owes many billions of dollars in loaned money to other countries from within the Eurozone.

The global economy is shaping in such a way that the large players can exert more influence than the small players.  Being a large player on the global scale has become much more important and useful than in the past.

The Eurozone needs to unite, one economy, one government.  If the external debt of all member countries of the Eurozone was distribute equally among all citizens of all member states it would work out to about $60,000 per person.  This is relatively comparable to the average amount of debt per person in the US.

The Eurozone would be one economic unit, ie: We lend money to the Eurozone instead of the individual member states.  In this case, the money that was lent to Greece from Germany and France (among others) would be void, because you cannot lend money to separate states.  This may need to be clarified but in my point of view a state/province of a country cannot be in debt, only the country can be in debt.  In this case, the country is Eurozone and the state/provinces are the members of the Eurozone.

How do this solution benefit everyone?  Well, the people of Greece will immediately have a load taken off of their shoulders.  But how will the people of the successful member states benefit?  They will go into Greece, Italy, and whatever other member states with a horrible economy, and fix it.  Piece by piece, balance the budget, until each province/state of the Eurozone is successful once again.  Do the people of Greece really care who their government is, as long as they are getting out of debt and back to living a stable life?

Once the member states economies are revitalized, then the benefits to  the 6 pack are revealed again, with more buying power due to the unity of all ~300 million people and also a greater say in global politics.

To me, I see this from a business standpoint.  17 smaller business are weaker than 1 single business that is an amalgamation of those 17.

I think this discussion could benefit from other people who are within the Eurozone.  What is your take on the situation?  Is there any sense in these solutions?

true,arkiel,null,null,"&gt;French people seem to take real offense to foreigners decimating their language. They don't accept a bad accent or bad pronunciation. For example, take the French word for calm: calme. At first, I thought it was just pronounced the English way. I would repeat it several times, and the person would have no idea what the fuck I was saying, even in context. Whereas if a French person speaking English pronounces the word calm in the French way, we can understand no problem. I think Americans are just more used to dealing with foreigners and different accents.

We don't take it as an offense at all. It may seem rude to foreign speakers, but all they're trying to do is help you, don't take it the wrong way. It is true that sometimes, if you don't pronounce a word the right way people won't understand, but seriously, that's true in any language. As for your friends, how about just asking them to speak french ? I think that's your problem. It is true that people will try to switch to english if they think they can speak it better than you speak french, but then again, it's not because they can't stand you speaking english, or take offense in your pronunciation, or want to show off (well, it happens but it's rare), it's for facilitating conversation. They're just trying to be nice/polite.

We're just used to switch to english with foreigners when they don't speak french very well just to facilitate communication. It's not just english speakers : germans, russians, greeks, whatever.

true,dorfsmay,null,null,"I went the other way around, french speaker immigrated to english-speaking countries.

Yeah, english grammar is slightly simpler than french grammar, BUT, trust me, there are other challenges to go from french to english:

* french is one dimensional, no stress on the word, when we learn english it is very hard for us to remember where the stress is, and english do NOT understand when we put it at the wrong place.

* in France, everybody follows the same grammar rules, the one taught in school. In english speaking country, it is ok not to follow the rules. Hard on a foreigner, no re-enforcement + confusion. (""I wish I were at the party"", ""I wish I was at the party"", etc... I know technically only the first one is correct, people use both.

* english adopts foreign words, inventing a new pronunciation for it, and not changing the spelling, making reading a guessing game (how do you pronounce ""matinee""?).

* in french speaking countries, there is typically one accent per country. England has more accent then people! And then you run into scottish, irish and american people!!

Now about you.

Sorry but 2 years, yes you should absolutely be fluent.

* friends: How the hell did you make friends with english speaking people. You seek them? You went to english pub? You exchange phone numbers as soon as you met english speaking people? That's all wrong. Think hard about what you are passionate about, seek people with those passion. Join a sports club, soccer/running whatever you like, join the one club that is closest to your place.

* reddit? reddit? What the fuck are you spending any time on an english website. Source your news in french.

    * Read the newspaper in french, even if you never read a news paper before. Yes, it will take an hour and looking up words to understand one article, but that's how you learn.

    * Do NOT read books in english, go to the library, or even buy books for grade 2 and 3. Move up slowly, within six months to a year you'll be reading tee-ager type books, and will be able to start reading adult books again, but in french.

    * Watch the new on TV, in french. That + the news paper will give you an idea of what's going on. Your brain is thirsty to know what's going on, if you do NOT read / listen to ANY news in english, your brain will go crazy and learn french faster. Try to talk about the news, in french, with people around you.

* take a french class. Ask the ""mairie"" if there are class for immigrants. Go. The other student might be poor and/or worse at french than you are, whatever, complete the classes and make sure you absolutely master everything they taught you.

* rent french DVDs, and put the french sound and the french subtitles on.

If anything this will help you tremendously to understand where your students are coming from. They don't even have the luxury to be immersed in the language like YOU are.

Two years is absolutely not enough time to become fluent in a language unless you are only speaking that language all day every day. I speak/hear French maybe 1 hour a day since my work is in English and my friends/family all speak English.

Also, I know a Swedish girl here who is fluent in English and German. She's been here as long as I have and her French is the same as mine. I also know an American who has been here for 2 years longer than I have whose French is only a bit better than mine.

They were the trigger, not the cause.

Greece' problems are home made. They might have been able to pull this off for another year or two, but not for much longer. However, there would have been more financial and political capital to help, had it not been for the other crisis.

When the US housing bubble burst, it took the ones in Spain and Ireland with it. Both countries had exemplary fiscal policies, with low debt and even a budget surplus. But all those investors from the European core withdrew their capital from Spain, and the overleveraged banks of the Celtic Tiger had bitten off more than they could chew. That's not really the US' fault, other than setting a bad example followed by a very scary one of what happens when you rely on housing prices to go up indefinitely.

When somebody says that the banks were greedy when they invested in Greek debt I'm the first to point out that from 2001-2007, the average spread to Bunds was only 0.27%, and that it was really the opposite of speculation.

All in all I think that Bologna process had a positive effect to the Finnish higher education system. It changed our system to resemble bit more of the American system.

Secondly, the reason they effectively have so much power is because various governments around the world have passed laws which use the rating agencies ratings as reference points. So for sake of example banks must hold a certain amount of liquid reserves of a certain quality and government bonds of a certain level as rated by the rating agencies would qualify.

Thirdly there are three agencies which each use slightly different methodologies which is why America was downgraded by one of them for example but not all of them, I believe it often requires two agencies to perform a downgrade before there are serious consequences in terms of asset allocations in financial institutions.

Finally yes the rating agencies completely screwed up in the run up to the financial crisis, you might say they are attempting to make up for that by being more rigorous now. And I'm not entirely sure what the alternative is? There is a need for financial assets and companies to be rated on their credit worthiness, the rating agencies are there to serve that purpose, nobody is bound by those ratings unless the law mandates them so, in which case its not the rating agencies you should have a problem with but rather the government that created the law.

They are actually tied to the 4th place. They won another seat actually, which hasn't been implemented due to some Lisbon treaty complications, but the other group did too - so the tie would remain.

Regardless, the group they're tied with is not particularly significant due to its euro-skepticism, which make it rarely see eye-to-eye with any other significant grouping. Greens otoh are a good coalition partner.

Further, they were the biggest winners of the last elections (the only ones to grow in absolute numbers, even though the overall parliament size was reduced), and their members had other successes since on lower levels (like the green prime minister of one German state, where they were largest, and overall gains in representation) . 

Since ruling outside some coalition is not common in any proportional representation, being 4th (or fourth among those able to form a coalition) is quite a large thing - presuming 2 is enough for a coalition (otherwise even smaller partners might be significant), there are just 3 possible ruling combinations then: left-of-centre, right-of-centre, and the grand coalition. The 2 largest parties would be in 2 of those combinations in power (grand + their respective block), the 3 &amp; 4 (each) in 1 of those combinations in power.

So someone interviewed a self-hating German - those are *really* hard to find these days :|.

You can not compare debt that Greece spent its way into and war reparations that were placed upon a defeated nation. The fact that the Americans, Brits, and French decided not to reinstate those reparations after the war was a product of the issue of reparations being one of the major causes of the rise of Hitler and therefore, of WW2 in the form that we experienced it. Learn your history.

&gt;free media or a racist propaganda that benefits economic trusts keeping german people uninformed????

Right, the German government are controlling German media, in league with the mega corporations, IMF, World Bank, CIA, Illuminati, Justice league, and Batman.

Or perhaps, just maybe, a subsection of the German people are pissed off about having to give you guys 100 billion euros, and their tabloid press picked up on that and sold them the populist vitriol they wanted to hear?

&gt;this is not a valid argument. you should know greek economy is based on services. Services does not generates as much as industry. If you want to know about the destruction of greek industry read world war two history.

The UK is a services based economy and we seem to do OK. As for the WW2 reference, it was 70 years ago, stop complaining about it. You lost your factories? Boo fucking hoo. We lost an empire, the Ukrainians lost 7% of their population, Japan got nuked, and the Jews had about 2/3 of their population systematically exterminated.

&gt;about taxes and how they affect every day life

Right, so what you're saying is that life isn't necessarily that great in Greece. I get you, and I acknowledge that fact. Having spoken to several Greeks about things, it sounds like shit's not much fun right now. That said, your taxes are nowhere near the highest in Europe, and a big part of the reason that your country is so damn expensive right now is because your economy is fucked.

Check the table out. The dollar is being threatened by the existence of the euro. This is what this propaganda is all about... if it continues the way it is, the dollar becomes obsolete in a few years. I imagine that because of this crisis and because the swiss franc is now pegged to the euro, the british pound is probably the new currency that interests people. Ideally what would be nice to come from this is for the UK to realize that they are not invulnerable either (because of the whole smugness of ""ha.. look at us.. we're doing great because we're not in the eurozone"")... If the UK decided to join the eurozone some time in the near future, the dollar is pretty much toast and the euro would almost automatically become the major reserve currency within a few years... THIS is why you keep hearing about how europe is fucked and the dollar is safe and all that crap... and hey.. don't even dare go check  out the poor country called the ""United States of America"" which has the least amount of money in the world.. they are #1..

BONUS: Her majesty the queen can be put on all of the euro coins made for the UK.. and she we will end up being in almost every european's pocket at some point :)

BONUS #2: The euro may not seem appealing to the UK _right now_.. but give it a few weeks or months of this propaganda against the pound... wait until the pound is worth less than a euro (check the exchange rate graphs from yesterday.. it literally dropped like 3 cents within a minute or so).. at some point if the pound starts losing a lot of value.. a lot of people will be begging for the euro's purchasing power -- and lets face it.. the pound doesn't buy what it used to anymore.

Former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in September 2007 that the euro could replace the U.S. dollar as the world's primary reserve currency.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I would have the blighted states hand over sovreignty completely to a EU task force of technocrats which would then do everything necessary to stabilize the situation. That should scare the shit out of everyone enough to avoid similar situations in the future.

well, this isn't too different than currently, no? The EU and IMF dictate conditionality, you either do as you're told, or they pull out and you're bankrupt. Though maybe it wouldn't be too bad an idea as a final step (though when I read it I thought it unnecessarily invasive). 

Still, maybe I'd rather have a good model of Eurobonds, so that any one country's individual portion of debt cannot easily be so large to jeopardize stability of the financial markets, and further cannot destabilize the eurozone as a whole, since in exceptional circumstances, the stable countries can just issue as much common debt as needed to solve any contagion effects of letting someone go bust. Right now such an act on nation-by-nation level would risk pulling other countries into troubles, if they're near the tipping point themselves, and then if those burst, still others are dragged into it etc, like domino.

Then the threat - do as you're told or go bankrupt is quite more credible, and even such scenario happening needn't worry anyone too much. Plus, the Commission gets a powerful penalty for anyone ignoring Stability Pact rules of not letting it issue any further joint debt, thus making any further fiscal indiscipline much more expensive to it.

&gt;But seriously, how long will they keep pretending that the 17 euro-countries can coexist with completely different fiscal and economic policies? It's one or the other, debt covenants have obviously not been enough and now seems the perfect time to make this clear.

I agree. BUT this kind of institution-building won't happen in one hop, and actually I don't really have an idea what kind of model is it exactly to take. The issue I see is that 'fiscal policy' sounds like it could really be everything and anything, and EU has to have explicit competencies to act in any field. It could be pensions, it's taxes, its public services, labor laws etc - really, every element of budget at all.

What currently seems to be happening is the EuroPlus Pact and the European Semester, but this is all just peer + market pressure, not actual enforceable decisions. Though even this will be some kind of first step, since at least it gives clear objectives, benchmarks for fulfilling them, and commitments for concrete measures to fulfill them, and having to publicly answer for one's choices in budgeting, in terms of such benchmarks, in response to given recommendations etc. to parliament and council.

And if you really f* up about any of these, you do get progressively financially penalized, finally this is actually enforceable in the new stronger Stability Pact. (now they're considering cutting cohesion funds too on non-compliance, but hard to say if this'll pass or not). 

Obv I think it should rather resemble more the community method, with commission setting the objectives and benchmarks, and having a majority vote on them and perhaps having choice of concrete measures to implement these objectives be a discretion of the states, but commitments they do so take be obligatory. And then Court of Justice being able to trial and legally oblige and financially penalize the countries for not fulfilling the objectives, or commitments (in addition to the current system of penalties, which is quicker to enforce). Perhaps this then doesn't require so open-ended expansion of EU's competencies, since this seems in line with powers to secure macroeconomic stability and sustainability of public finances they already decide on in the Stability and Growth Pact.

Ofc if the EU's own budget were comparatively huge, it could just not care like any other federal government, but perhaps that's more integration than is necessary (I'd like it to be as loose as possible, but no looser, as subsidiarity seems to imply)",0,1318016260,null,0,true,0,c2pojo9,t3_l49h9,t1_c2pojo9,t1_c2po9rn,1427700566,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
