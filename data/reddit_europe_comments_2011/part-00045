It's not like being able to read kurrent is genetic. Of course, being a native speaker makes it easier to guess what a letter *might* mean, and then there's the table on Wikipedia to verify.  
It's amazing how it gets easier with each document. I'm still a far way from being able to just read it, but I notice how I'm getting better at it.

What's I find so interesting about this one is the bureaucratic aspect that says a lot about society at the time. The document on the left is the ministry of the interior of the grand duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin  releasing your ancestors from the ""community of subjects"" (the common people in the feudal system), and as a final benevolent feudal act, gives consent to their emigration to America (note that this is pre-printed on the form, and ""America"" refers to what you would call ""the Americas"").

First of all, you have to get a ""permesso di soggiorno"", (lit. living room permit :-)) a permission to stay and work in the country. To keep staying, you'll need a house, too. And they'll come in and inspect it's adequate for you.

How do you get it? You must have a job. How do you get a job? You must come over here and find one. But you can't come here to work if you don't have a job. Yeah.

Rent: I live in a ~240 sqft (24 sqm) flat, one room with bathroom and small kitchen. And just the rent is 500€, plus around other 120€/month of other things such as light, telephone, gas and garbage tax. Oh you don't want to have a TV, that's 120€ more per year. You have a computer? Too bad that's considered a TV too. What? You have neither a TV nor a computer? Well what's that? An MP3 player with builtin radio. That'll be 70€/year, for the radio.

Learn Italian. Just do it, or you'll starve. OK I might have exaggerated, you won't starve, and people will try to understand what you're saying TALKING BACK LOUDER. You won't resist much just pointing at things, gesticulating.

Healthcare is free if you have a job, around 150€/year if you are here as a student.

Be wary. Especially in big cities people will try to scam you. Going at a restaurant? Don't leave any tip. You just don't have to. If they insist, just say ""Guardia di finanza"". Insert clichè vinyl scratch, music stopping and everyone looking at you. No sane Italian would ever call them on purpose. But you're a foreigner and you have nothing to lose. And magically they'll stop insisting for the tip. It's like the I.R.S... with guns. Literally. And they can come over there and shut the place down.

Find a friend, one you can really trust (but /r/italy works just as well) and keep him handy every time you have a question on how things work.

So it sounds like you have to the exact right set of circumstances to even get into the country. May I ask what type of area you live in. Suburbs, country, decent area, ok area? How are your neighbors? Are you a native Italian or did you move over?

I have begun learning Italian. I have several Italian language speakers who will be helping me and I've picked up Pimsleur &amp; going to get Rosetta Stone. My plan is to give myself a solid year of immersion in the language here in America then go visit my family next year around this time. Once I go over I can speak to them about my ideas, plans based upon my opportunity with my job abilities.

I Live right next to New York City so I understand not everyone is a friend or friendly. Thankfully I have decent people skills, I must only overcome the language barrier.  The I.R.S. with guns tip is good to keep on the back burner if things ever got really bad. 

How will my attempts to speak the language, adapt to the lifestyle be accepted by Italians as a whole? My attitude is different then most Americans but I think this comes from my being raised close to my Italian family.

Our neighbours are nice, maybe a bit loud at times, the only annoying one is the bar downstairs who keeps on blaring music from 8:30 in the morning to 2:00 am. I'm running mad but my parents are getting deaf, they can't hear it and I'm going back to the university in 2 weeks so  as much as I'd like to go down there and cut the CD (yeah, the same, every day, for 2 months) with a pair of scissors I'll resist...

I like public healthcare. As all things public, it's never at its maximum efficiency (read: lots of bureaucracy and wasted money) but it's heartwarming to know that should anything happen to you, you're covered for life. When my grandmother began to feel sick and died, last year, we just called 118, they came in and took her to the hospital, no questions asked. Everything free. When I pay taxes, at least I know that part of them are going to those who really need those money to live.

The difference between New York and over here is that here, the friendlier they are, the more dangerous. Someone sees you're looking at a map and asks if you need directions? Don't turn them down, they might genuinely want to help, but keep a hand on your wallet.

We are not ALL scumbags.

I would never try to scam anyone, and i know for sure, there are a lot of people just like me in this country.

Just stay far away from the tourists traps. And for tourists traps i mostly mean restaurants around big monuments.

Sure, if you eat in a restaurant around the Colosseum you'll end up paying 10 times the right price. Just don't go there.

And yes, in Italy you're not required to pay a tip. Sometimes the waiters or the owners will try to ask a tip, you don't need to scream ""GUARDIA DI FINANZA"", you can just say ""non devo pagare nessuna mancia"". If they insist, use the ""finanza"" method.

By the way, in Italy we pay a tip when we think the service was good. If you chose wisely the places where to eat, you'll mostly be willing to pay a small tip, both cause the service was good, and the prices were honest.

Don't try to find shortcuts... At least until you'll be enough confident about what you're doing. Or if you have some italian friend you REALLY trust.

For example, if you're in Naples, don't ever consider the idea of buying something from the streets (don't consider this idea neither in other cities), you won't end up with something which was stolen. You'll end with a bag of sand, or rocks, or bricks. Literally: [""Il pacco napoletano""](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=il+pacco+napoletano).

The ""Auch"" in ""Tangrim Auch Goien"" doesn't seem to be correct. Apart from capitalization, none of the persons was from Goien, which is about 6km south of Tangrim.

Because of that, the NPD hasn't been forbidden yet. The other reason is, as pointed out by Wusch, that the NPD simply hasn't done anything yet that could justify a prohibition.

While the NPD is indeed 'verfassungsfeindlich' (unconstitutional, does not comply with the 'grundgesetz', the basic law for the federal republic of germany), banning them would not just magically purge any problems caused by them - what german youth REALLY needs is 'aufklärung' (education, for the lack of a better translation).

true,mynicknameisunknown,null,null,"When i look at the details and the wider context i see that the events in Athens and London have nothing or close to nothing in common.
This article is also wrong in drawing conclusions on that subject based on comparisons of economic data and some sociological statistics.

In Athens people from all parts of the society protested, for a good reason. A big group of the protesters were educated people. 
When protests turned violent it was often just because police was not able to de-escalate.
Plain violent riots occured as a side effect and as violence coming from an ""extreme""-left-corner is already existing for a longer while in Greece, the connection to the general protests is sparsely.
In London people rioted and looted for no reason. They are even too stupid to find a reason, even not able to find someone doing it for them, to mask their criminal activity in a smart way. A big group of the looters are obviously just criminals and i can imagine many are also known as criminals. I guess it is often the type of person that in the US would already have been confined for many years in a prison. (Not saying that i think this is a good idea) 
The London rioters, ultimately, will either take more responsibility for their own lifes and families and achieve something one day or they will crash in a prison. There might be just a small chance/opportunity for them and that surely should be improved by the british society, but their own responsibility is the key factor here.
You can't say that about the majority of greek people. Mostly they are only to blame for the politicians they voted for and allowing their governments to become so important for them. That is not much blame (as it is just a small part of the problem) and more or less also true for most europeans. For too many young people, the only real opportunity currently is to leave their country.
In the UK it is still much easier to stand on your own feet and get along in your life than in Greece. By using sociological statistics and definitions you can maybe show similar problems or poverty, but in reality it is not similar at all. The opportunities they have and the problems they are fighting with are too different.

The London riots just show what happens when crime, poverty and stupidity is developing and concentrating in certain areas/neighbourhoods of bigger cities and the inequality, also in opportunities, to too many other areas/neighbourhoods is becoming too big.

You say ""presumably"", but I don't see any reason to so presume. It's pretty clear to me that European politicians genuinely believe that US credit agencies are being unduly harsh on European countries. Definitely Italian authorities have been investigating S&amp;P and Moody's, maybe other countries have been doing the same. After all, the agencies' credibility has been pretty much shot by their handling of the financial crisis.

&gt; Still, if the EU wants us out, I hope they repay all our ""membership fees"".

They won't, nor should they. Britain paid those fees in return for access to European markets and a say in how what is now the world's largest trading bloc is run.

Why should I? You're the one putting across the argument, it's up to you to provide credible and recent data. Back your own arguments up.

&gt; Other countries (for example Germany) are in a similar position, but only the UK receives the rebate. I think it's reasonable that wealthy countries contribute more than they get.

The CAP seems to be an EU wide thing - with France receiving a ton from it (http://www.farmsubsidy.org/FR/). My maths may be wrong, but the UK receives a fraction of what France gets (http://www.farmsubsidy.org/GB/) so even with our rebate we get less than France does, back.

Even Germany (http://www.farmsubsidy.org/DE/) takes part. 

So yes, I think it's quite right that we abolish the CAP then as part of an EU wide programme of rebate abolishment. France won't like it, of course. Wouldn't want to lose €9.9 billion in subsidy.

What also appears to be interesting is that the UK is almost exemplary at providing data on what it gets from the CAP and what it does with it - it is 3rd on that website's ""transparency"" index alongside Sweden and Denmark.

What a ghastly outlook. I'd rather concentrate on further automation, with current technology levels 70% unemployment with western middle-class living standards for all of them should be doable. Greener than now, of course, otherwise the whole thing would eat itself in a matter of years.

Imagine what we could do with 70% of the people well-fed, well-housed, with access to proper healthcare and everything, *free to do what the fuck they want*. Like, eliminate the epidemic of overworked psychological wrecks in the workplace, spend ample time with our kids, spend 7 hours preparing dinner just for the heck of it (don't forget to invite those hard-working 30% over, they've earned it in addition to their generous wages), build a fleet of Viking ships and race them around the world just for the heck of it, build a space elevator, learn to play cello, and, leaving out a gazillion things, last, but not least, research to get more people unemployed.

Greener than now, of course, otherwise the whole thing would eat itself in a matter of years.

While I agree that automation is significantly more efficient, it is energy intensive and reduces employment in a time when we need to create meaningful work experiences. Asking someone to become a machine tender is debasing for many and deprives society of the beauty that an artisan brings into our lives.

&gt; Imagine what we could do with 70% of the people well-fed, well-housed, with access to proper healthcare and everything, free to do what the fuck they want.

I'm loving that goal and would prefer to see it pushed to 100%. I am also pragmatic enough to know that many conservatives will fight, probably to the death, to prevent such a society from being built because it invalidates much of what they believe. Is should probably clarify that last statement so as to state that I am referring to the newly baptized American version of conservative - not the conservatives that I grew up with.

&gt; Like, eliminate the epidemic of overworked psychological wrecks in the workplace, spend ample time with our kids, spend 7 hours preparing dinner just for the heck of it (don't forget to invite those hard-working 30% over, they've earned it in addition to their generous wages), build a fleet of Viking ships and race them around the world just for the heck of it, build a space elevator, learn to play cello, and, leaving out a gazillion things, last, but not least, research to get more people unemployed.

This is what we should be working towards - but change like the ones we are proposing scare the crap out of many. 

Now, imagine the response of a leader had the guts to stand up and give that speech. Damn.

It isn't us, it isn't our friends and the people we talk to. We have a need for someone like Ron Paul (to give an example) to stand up and speak those words in such a way as to galvanize the country, if not the world, around this concept.

There is no party or organization that backs these ideals and it is unlikely to form unless there is a significant crashing of the current system - and that may be what it is going to take.

This is what these kids are doing, even if they can't put it into words and both of our countries are going to see this upheaval sooner as opposed to later. I honestly believe that sometimes countries, just like the people who comprise them, need to hit rock bottom before they can change.

Your ""maths"" just looks on the side of subsidies, but the rebate defines how much the UK have to pay to the EU. Regarding newer data: I still think you would have to do it since you were discontent with my link. Nonetheless, [here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8036802.stm) is a BBC-article from 2009 regarding the rebate. According to this article, the rebate was at 6.3 billion Euros in 2009. If you add the rebate and UK farm subsidies the sum even exceed the farm subsidies of France.

My point, that other countries like Germany, or also the Netherlands, are in a similar position still stands. They contribute far more to the EU than they get. It just hurts the sense for equality that one of 27 countries gets a rebate.

&gt; What also appears to be interesting is that the UK is almost exemplary at providing data on what it gets from the CAP and what it does with it - it is 3rd on that website's ""transparency"" index alongside Sweden and Denmark. France, Germany and for reference Austria don't appear to do quite so well. Maybe the UK should stay in the EU so we can impart our own brand of honesty and transparency?

Now you are just plain offensive.

Aber gerade in den Bundesländern, in denen Die Linke bereist regiert gilt, dass sie das gleiche machen wie alle anderen Parteien in Deutschland. Ich nehme dafür gerne die Grünen als Beispiel. Denn die haben sich in den 80ern als durch und durch pazifistische Partei gegründet und 1994 den Austritt aus der Nato und die Abschaffung der Bundeswehr in ihr Wahlprogramm für die Bundestagswahl geschrieben. Und 1999 den ersten Agriffskrieg der bundesdeutschen Nachrkriegsgeschichte geführt. Die Linke hat jetzt nicht so ein schönes Beispiel, jedoch schreit sie ständig Kommunismus und macht dann doch genau das gleiche wie alle anderen Parteien. Und die CDU wettert dagegen und übt aber selbst den Sozialismus. 

Es geht schon damit los, dass man entweder aus Europa austreten muss, oder Europa demokratisieren und transparent gestalten muss. Denn fast alle wichtigen Entscheidungen werden inzwischen auf europäischer Ebene gefasst. Das Erschreckende dabei: Selbst Politikfelder, die theoretisch reine Ländersache sind, als per europäischem Vertrag eben nicht in Brüssel entschieden werden, wollen die Länder abstimmen und handeln Verträge aus. Ebenfalls nicht in den Parlamenten. Es gibt aber so schon genug Politikfelder bei denen Brüssel ganz legal den Ton angibt, dass man sagen kann das die Mehrheit der uns betreffenden Entscheidungen nicht in Berlin gefällt werden. Es gibt aber keine Wahlen für Brüssel. Der Prozess ist sehr, sehr wenig demokratisch. Das EU-Parlament hat immernoch kaum Einfluss.

Und diesen simplen Fakt verschweigen uns z.B. die deutschen Parteien geflissentlich. Weil sie die Realität, dass sie auf deutscher Ebene ziemlich unbedeutend sind, nicht gerne akzeptieren. Selbst die Spitzen der Parteien geben sich dieser Illusion hin. Das Gesundheitssystem ist eines der wenigen Felder, bei denen noch sehr viel in Berlin entschieden wird. Trotzdem hat sich Rösler vom Gesundheitsministerium zum Wirtschaftsministerium 'befördert'. Eine reine Image-Verbesserung mit einem hohen Kompetenzverlust verbunden. Denn Wirtschaftspolitik wird ganz überwiegend in Brüssel gemacht.

Wenn sich die Parteien schon bei diesen grundlegenden Dingen selbst belügen, was sollen sie uns dann noch für Antworten bieten? Weil ich liberal bin, fand ich Die Piraten immer ganz interessant. Bis sie vor einiger Zeit einen Streit über das 'Grundeinkommen' hatten. Bei dem die 'Befürworter' gewannen. Ohne zu merken, dass besagtes Grundeinkommen ein besserer Name für Sozialhilfe ist. Es ist sicherlich eine gute Idee mal über eine Image-Verbesserung der Sozialhilfe nachzudenken. Aber man sollte das Kind schon beim Namen nennen.

Excuse me, that I think it's unfair that Britain alone gets this huge rebate just because France benefits inadequately. This deal just doesn't reflect the reality any more.

&gt; to abolish the grossly unfair CAP

An interesting proposal. I would agree with you if you would have said, that the CAP needs to be reformed. I think a lowering of the subsidies step by step would have the effect of rising prices on agricultural products, so most farmers would survive the change. Other services done by the farmers, like the conservation of the countryside, would require service level agreements between the community and the farmers, but it would be manageable. Of course, a lowering of the subsidies would also require a lowering of the huge amount of requirements a farmer needs to fulfill to get the subsidies. These requirements are a massive restriction to the freedom of actions for farmers.

Also, I think the effects of the fact, that agriculture is one of the few things which are financed EU-wide could be lowered, if other sectors would be financed EU-wide too.

An example would be the financing of universities. Students are free to study anywhere in Europe, but the universities are financed by the country in which they are located. This leads to problems, especially for small countries. Example: Many german students want to study medicine in Austria. Since Germany is much bigger than Austria, Austrias medicin universities are flooded with inscriptions of german students. Austria imposed the regulation, that the german students get only one third of the university places. But this is a de facto a discrimination of german students. As far as I know, Belgium has the same problem with France. Austria/Belgium can't shoulder the burden to finance the education of all the german/french students that want to study there. If the universities would be financed EU-wide, it would be easy to enlarge the demanded universities, regardless of where they are located.",0,1313405459,null,0,false,0,c2ckn7p,t3_jhq78,t1_c2ckn7p,t1_c2cf9aq,1427473532,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I think DocTomoe's gripe is that it's very obvious that you're not thinking in German at all. You're forming a sentence in English, then translating it poorly. You can't do this if you want to learn a language. 

Your title, for example, shows a lack of understanding of how you even put a sentence together: kann euch mir helfen. That sentence has no pronoun which can be the subject, which leads us to guess that you don't know the subject of ""can you help me?"" Other rough parts in your German include ""ich war fragen mich"", which is rather obviously ""I was asking myself"" but would be expressed as ""ich habe mich gefragt"" because ""was asking"" is the past progressive form of ""to ask"", which is something that is almost never used in German. You understand this in much of the rest of your post.

Now, some of it is just expressed totally different by Germans: ""I'm learning to be a teacher"" would have to use studieren, which is a difficult thing for English speakers to use anyway.  The Germans would say something like ""ich studiere Pädagogik"" or some other strange thing. A more close translation might be ""Ich studiere, um Lehrer zu werden"", but that doesn't sound to me like a sentence a German would say.",0,1313454042,null,0,false,0,c2cq23g,t3_jib1z,t1_c2cq23g,t1_c2cd3ee,1427476150,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

ALDI, NETTO and LIDL are quite good discounters, but you won't find everything there. If you need something special, go to REWE/EDEKA, they are more expensive but have a larger range of stuff. I would recommend KAUFLAND, they have both cheap food AND a wide variety of stuff.",0,1313455749,null,0,false,0,c2cq9qk,t3_jfjih,t1_c2cq9qk,t3_jfjih,1428216595,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1
