My ""real bank"" account is on Caisse d'Epargne. They have agencies everywhere, they are not the most expensive and if you are not going to change departments often, it's a very decent option (department thingy: Caisse d'Epargne Ile-de-France is different than Caisse d'Epargne-other-dept and it's practically a different bank, they just cooperate). I have a very good employee assigned to me and since she knows me, I send a letter for everything I need and it's done in an instant. Their online system works, it doesn't get on your nerves and you can do every basic stuff: move money to/from your accounts, to external accounts you have previously authorized (in written/person, see letters mentioned before), see details about transactions etc. When going abroad I have never ever had any problems using my card as a payment method or to withdraw money, and I'm quite sure there were no extra costs to withdraw money from the EU. 

My boyfriend as one at Credit Agricole and he finds them a bit slowww and not very up to date, but I don't have a personal opinion. 

We have a common account on an online bank: ING Direct. Everything is going smoothly, everything was set up online and with some documents sent. Very fast, very professional. You get a visa gold (for whatever that's worth) easily, and we also got 60 free Euros upon opening the account. There are no extra charges to have a card/account (cause with real banks, it is the case in France -something that shocked me when I moved here), and on the plus side they have some real agencies if you ever need to get physical :) We haven't used this one abroad, so no comments.

My boyfriend has a boursorama (online bank again) account, that he's using as his primary account. Everything online, blabla, no extra costs and charges, gold card, money as a welcoming gift. There used to be some problems with boursorama being too vigilant when you were using your card abroad, but we had no problems 3 weeks in the US. At some point, over an internet purchase it did get blocked, and then they kinda screwed up over the phone (said it's ok, when it wasn't), but all in all it was ok in a few days. Keep it in mind if it's your only card and you depend on it ever, however. 

Caisse d'Epargne, Boursorama and ING Direct have decent android apps also, if this means anything to you. 

I only know of ridiculous stories with BNP and i know that the Postal Bank is very very slow and old school with all procedures. 


Good luck with your catch-22. If you have someone you know, you can ask them to make an attestation d'hebergement a titre gratuit (you're staying with them for free) and hand it in with one of their electricity bills when you need a justificatif de domicile. And then when you have your own place, you change the address. It is very standard procedure, and it is the case with me (I'm not paying rent for my house). It will be much better than a mailbox, because they ask for a ""justificatif de domicile"" not a mail address.

Rent a flat. Much cheaper then a hotel. CDG is a lil ways away. You don't want to drive in Paris if you don't have to. Trust me on that. 

You can get a flat starting around $50 a night for a shared place or you can get your own starting around $80, and decent ones with some space around $110. You'll have your own kitchen, a hell of a view (hopefully), and you'll be able to browse the markets, butchers, bakers, wine shops, etc.. 

As far as what to do. La Defense, Latin Quarter, Les Frigos, Sacre Coeur, Les Catacombes, eat, drink, be merry, etc.. There really is an endless list.

I don't think the earth is in any problem; we had more extreme climates in various parts of geologic past. Its just what will suit humans better. More precisely, what costs and what sufferings the changes will create for us. The earth fixes problems over geologic times, not on a timescale relevant to humans - except that there are indeed various buffer mechanisms in nature to keep something like the current climactic balance. Well, its just overflowing such buffers that's usually discussed when speaking about 'catastrophic climate change' - and what commits us on a damning further trajectory with little hope of redress, were we to overshoot certain CO2 ceilings for any substantial amount of time.

&gt;Even if the levels you cite are at the breaking point, we will not see a tangible effect on society right now as would in a depression right now

ahh, yes, ok then I agree - the EFFECTS of what we do now and in a couple of years to come will come to haunt us only with a significant delay. I'm not sure why that's an important thing though. (more below) But:

&gt;The effects are drawn out giving time for actions(although we are running out) 

Well, ok technically I have to concede - whatever happens with the economy will probably develop on a year-or-two timescale. Climate won't be destroyed in such time period, exactly. I'm still however emphasizing that it is a problem that must be adresses in the 5-10 yrs period tops, though, because you said ""we're not anywhere near a point of no return"", while in fact I think data  shows we're just about there.

So, that was basically the point of the numbers I was citing - we don't have any time  to prevent catastrophic climate change, since we're bumping into the dangerous territory any year, or already are in it - though ofc even if we do cross some limits, things just get worse the longer we delay.

Climate reacts with a delay, so you can't simply hope to start addressing the problem around the time when you experience the worst effects, to avoid most of the devastation. Bringing down emission levels rapidly is still much more difficult than stabilizing them on some level before they get far out of hand. If you were experiencing a train crash unfolding in slow motion, perhaps seeing the first frames of the damage to say fronts of the trains slowly growing wouldn't be that alarming. BUT you'll be just as powerless to prevent it continuing once it starts as if it were happening in normal speed.

So, that's why I'm not sure as to the relevance of the fact other ppl will experience the worst of the climate change, while we are staring into the depression - since acts over the next few years determine much of the course for both.

Well, on that matter, I don't think we're risking a 'deep depression' - for now we just have slowed growth, and risking a double dip recession. Unfortunate, but not sure why I should treat that as automatically a severe result. Plus there's so little room for maneuver in most budgets that I don't see what but sitting tight is supposed to be done about it.",0,1318371241,null,0,true,0,c2qp7nj,t3_l72bk,t1_c2qp7nj,t1_c2qp0xj,1427718107,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Also I'd merge his post with that of the President of the European Council - there is no explicit ban on the same person being both in the Lisbon treaty anyway, and doesn't really give him any powers - he's just a chair (I hope that's the right phrase, since literally that makes no sense ;-) ). This would be analogous to how High Representative is both a commissioner and presides over the Council of foreign ministers, here the head of commission would preside over the Council of heads of governments. I think Eurozone President could be analogously an economic commissioner tasked with things like the European Semester and Stability Pact proposals, and chair EcoFin.

I'd go the other way and make it easier for him to be removed (i think it takes 2/3 majority now). Then this works like on national level - Barosso was actually the Commission President candidate of the People's Party. Just wasn't much of a race since the left block didn't have its candidate (they need to have direct (closed) primaries next time; it could happen, there are internal calls in PES to do so). Better to use a transnational district, as was suggested by the constitutional committee of the European parliament, and demand open-list systems be used for elections for European parliament, part of the same reform, and make candidates for commission presidents be from the carriers (or whatever the English term is; I mean, those who are on first place) of the lists. A separate call was made by the current president of the European parliament, for parties to put their national commissioner candidates as carriers of their national lists in elections for the European parliament. That requires no change.

http://www.europarl.europa.eu/en/headlines/content/20110415STO17908/html/A-big-step-forward-for-a-United-European-Democracy-Duff-on-electoral-reform

I'm doubtful nations will allow this ambitious reform, though. Carrying national lists and direct primaries and having a clear campaign with opposing commission president candidates might however, that requires no changes.

&gt;Either the threshold of countries needed to pass a bill such as this needs to be lowered, or the EU needs to become a more centralized federal authority.

Yes, ideally, I think it should be some supermajority vote based on the same financial key as ECB voting is. But it prob won't be easy to transfer that power. Wouldn't this recent ruling of the German constitutional court even possibly make it impossible for Germany to accept this? 

But, perhaps, these structural changes to the fund like this vote do indeed need to remain unanimous even then - no big deal anyway, just some political maneuverings in Slovakia to grab power that should be resolved in a few days - and remember its been since July this ratification thing was in progress, so minor irrelevant delay. Seems consistent with how for now Treaty change requires unanimity (I'd rather see a Qualified Majority pan-european referenda for this, but, meh, pipe dream), since we are talking about something comparably sensitive as sovereignty - namely, people's cash.

But releasing the funds, I'm not sure if it would be detrimental to participation in decisions if it were possible to simply consider a no vote as opting out of paying for that particular use, than a block to the majority. That doesn't imply any transfer of sovereignty or funds.

I started at Berlitz (horrible) and moved on to schools like Fokus, LTC, Wall Street Institute (full time contracts) and Linguarama. The level of teaching at these places can be a bit hit and miss as many of the people teaching are really only passing through and need a bit of money on the side. 

If teaching is what you really want to do and you have an actual teaching degree I would aim for one of two things: 

1. Private secondary schools are screaming out for good teachers and you will be a shoe-in with a degree in teaching backing you up. The big issue with this option will be your command of German. While English lessons technically should only be taught in English, the reality can be a bit more complicated than that. A friend of mine worked for a year as a teaching assistant and then decided to stay here full time, the year as an assistant had his German at more than good enough to get a ""real"" job at a private school from then on.

2. There are a good few International schools in Germany where the main language is English, as in, the teaching language is English regardless of subject so knowledge of German would be much less important. 

As for the visa, it should be no problem at all. I know Canadians, Americans, and Aussies who all work here without issue.

The fact of the matter is that it will be much more expensive for Slovakians if Greece defaults harder than anticipated, and if Portugal, Spain and Italy cannot depend on the EFSF to back their debt. If these economies fail the repercussions will be immense.

I am completely sympathetic to your thinking, but it is short-sighted and will damage you more in the long run. And not only you, but the whole of Europe and the entire world economy.

A compromise could be negotiated in which richer EU countries pay the amount that Slovakia would pay, or Slovakia gets some sort of collateral. But this sort of negotiation will take time. And the changes to the EFSF agreement would most likely mean a new round of ratifications. This is not time that the world economy has! Greece is due to default within a month if they don't get assistance.

Bail-outs are much cheaper than a collapse of the Euro. If Slovakia does not understand this they'll be branded forever as the small nation who wrecked the world economy.

When this mess is over we we can begin thinking about instituting rules in the European Union which will make sure that fiscally responsible member states don't have to pay for irresponsible nations.

Considering that we export more than Germany, 49 % of our GDP, and most of this is to the EU, we have a huge interest in being able to partake in the negotiations of the Euro-countries. Especially at this time given the Euro-crisis. We would also have an interest in contributing to the EFSF because ensuring stability in the region which we trade the most with is incredibly important to us.

I see no advantage in not being part of the Euro, unless one wants to un-peg the kroner from the Euro, which is a possibility so long that we are not a Euro-member. But I don't believe in devaluation as a fair tool. You only push the problems to your neighbouring countries. And as a country with no real raw materials, we have to import those, and as such a devaluation might actually hurt us more than it would benefit us, since the cost of importing would rise.

Not to mention that devaluation essentially amounts to stealing from your citizens, since their currency loses worth.",0,1318453336,null,0,true,0,c2qza0j,t3_l9jzm,t1_c2qza0j,t1_c2qydco,1427722916,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

But at the moment there's no alternative to keeping the countries who are in trouble afloat. If Greece defaults in a harsh manner, this will shake the European economy since French and German banks hold a lot of Greek debt. If these begin to waver the entire financial system of the EU is in danger.

Not to mention if doubt about the solvency of Portugal, Spain and Italy arises. The chaos which will result from this is quite literally scary to think about.

In the last issue of The Economist they made the estimate that a break-up of the Euro would cost Euro-countries about 25-35 % of their GDP, while non-Euro EU countries could face losses of 35-45 % of GDP.

Bernd is a puppet of the KiKa (Kinderkanal - Children's Chanel).  
It was (or is still, dunno) part of a puppet show with a talking sheep, a talking bush and a talking bread.  
Normally the bush invents something, the sheep goes into hyperADHS mode and the bread has to test the invention.  
Needless to say, hilarity ensues.  
Bernd has only two problems: A) He's borderline depressive and B) His arms are too short.  
That's about it in terms of explaining. The rest could fill pages at tvtropes. (I think it does...)  
*Edit: Strangly, it doesn't. He gets mentioned, but that's about that...*  
What you have seen is an endless loop just to broadcast something.  
The KiKa only broadcasts until 21:00 afaik. After that there's nothing to send.  
In older times they switched to another chanel but for various reasons they don't show Kanal Telemedial anymore (Please: Ask some other german victim about THAT!).  
So in order to not send a test image somebody at KiKa thought ""Well, we've still some drugs left *sniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiffff* AAAH! Let's make a Bernd endless loop.  
And so they did. 
In each of them (yes, there's more than that one) Bernd is trapped in front of the camera and has to perform... whatever.  
If I remember correctly from the smashing ball things, that must be the ""KiKa lounge - come in chill down, etc...""

Hope that did help a bit.  
Yeah, that's German Humor at it's best. ;)

Je pense que c'est une bonne idée si j'écris d'abord une lettre pour vous en anglais et vous pouvez la traduire pour pratiquer. Puis, j'écris la même lettre en français et vous la corrigerez pour moi et me donnerez des conseils. Ensuite, à votre tour, vous rédigez une lettre qui vous écrivez d'abord en français puis en anglais.

J'aime les langues. En anglais, ma grammaire est excellente. Au lycée, j'ai étudié l'espagnol et le français. Maintenant je suis au collège, et je recommence à étudier le français ce semestre. J'essaie très dur à écrire bien ce message, mais je sais que probablement, il y a beaucoup d'erreurs - c'est pourquoi j'ai besoin de votre aide, haha.

Si vous êtes intéressé par cette idée, répondez s'il vous plaît ici. Merci beaucoup, et j'espère que nous pouvons devenir des amis! :)

Outright blocking content is illegal under the Telecommunications Framework, as long as the material is legal, i.e. cp can be blocked. What should be acted upon is discriminatory behaviour such as favouring own content over the competition, i.e. throttling spotify in favour of the ISPs own streaming service. The Commission has stated in the Telecom Framework that it will enforce such breaches. 

We should also make a few distinctions in this debate. Firstly, currently the capacjty of wireless networks (3 or 4G) aren't as large as landline networks, so some amount of throttling may be required in the short term to alleviate this. Thereby not said that blocking VoIP is acceptable, due to it being discriminatory in nature. 

Secondly, the right to privacy is an issue I have not made up my mind about. On the one hand I would of course prefer that noone is tracking my actions online, but this seems to be more and more impossible. The governments have concerns about public security, i.e. terrorism, and the ISPs and, to a higher degree, the content providers makes their money by tracking users. This allows them to provide free content, without which my use of the internet would not be as high as it is. This is, however, a clear breach of my online privacy, and I don't actually mind that too much.

To sum up, I do not think we need EU wide regulations as long as the NN breaches are not systemic across all Member states.

true,sqrt2,EURO,European Union,"I don't understand this argument. We have a fiat money system, the elegance of which stems from the fact that money is created in the exact moment someone needs it (takes out a loan) and destroyed when it is no longer needed (the loan is paid back). A huge portion of the money in circulation that provides liquidity in the market of real-world goods is in fact someone's debt. In that sense, debt is prosperity.

What one needs to take into account, of course, is that the creation of money is regulated by its price, i.e. interest, and that the interest must be paid by economic growth. If some additional debt, however, kickstarts a nation's economy (or at least keeps it from freezing up), enabling it to pay the interest, that additional debt is not a problem.

You can of course make the argument that infinite economic growth is unrealistic etc. but in that case you ignore that additional debt is the method built into our system to keep an economy going, and you must propose an alternative monetary system that can achieve the same goals as fiat currency. I don't know of such an alternative. (On reddit, of course, it is fairly likely that someone will quote a certain US Senator who intends to return to the gold standard, but I do not see how the available amount of gold is supposed to match the growth of a national economy.)",0,1318540514,null,0,false,0,c2r9p1a,t3_lao4i,t1_c2r9p1a,t1_c2r6s3n,1427727957,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

If anything, regulation (primarily from Brussels) has massively increased competition between ISPs by removing monopolies of state-owned telecom companies and separating providers from infrastructure, creating an even playing field. Consumers have reaped the benefits of this competition with lower prices for better quality (faster) services.

What we need is *more* regulation. Telecom companies are giant, leeching, monopoly-seeking corporations whose primary goal is to milk consumers for every cent they have. Their previous business model (phone calls) is dying fast and they know it. They're doing everything they can to slow it down with such shenanigans as blocking VoIP calls. Their destiny is being reduced to infrastructure whose only purpose is to shovel bits from A to B, and they're scheming and lobbying to change that future.

Therefore, in order to secure their demise, we need regulation that prevents them from restricting access, making us pay for otherwise free services or messing with our traffic with throttling, shaping, advertising, collecting personal data etc. If the internet is a critical part of our infrastructure (which it is), purposely degrading its performance for profit should be illegal.",0,1318542445,null,0,false,0,c2ra01i,t3_lauhc,t1_c2ra01i,t1_c2r6tob,1427728100,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Inhalt:
Ich seh das ""Papier"" als eine Grundsatzerklärung, wie die Grünen mit ""dem Netz"" umgehen möchten, viel wird eingegangen auf grüne Ideen, das ""grüne Weltbild"".
Alle wichtigen Themen sind abgebildet, aber in einer Art die mich erschlägt, beim Thema der Gleichheit im Netz wird über die Brücke der Barrierefreiheit die Teilhabe von Behinderten behandelt. Hier fallen aber jeweils nur die Schlagworte, was die Themen genau sind, oder wie damit umgegangen werden soll erschließt sich mir nicht.

Allgemein sind mir zuviele ""Kampfbegriffe"" enthalten, die aber nicht durchdacht sind. Die Grünen möchten Deutschland zu einem Software und Start-Up Zentrum neben Amerika machen, fordern aber nur wenige Absätze höher ein Verbot von Softwarepatenten. (?)

The problem is that over time southern nations (as well as Ireland) have become less efficient economies vs their northern counterparts. Historically the way to solve this was for your exchange rate to drop vs Germany (and the rest of the northern nations) which would along with reforms to your economy help to restore competitiveness.

The euro removes that method of rebalancing economies because internal austerity &amp; reform is not sufficient on its own. The answer is fiscal transfer from one state to another, hence to use your example why the South East of England has helped to subsidise large swathes Britain through its taxes. Likewise why Northern Italy subsidises Southern Italy and why Belgium hasn't had a government for so long I can't actually remember when it started (two years now?) because the Flemmish part don't want to subsidise the French part.

All this can and has been papered over by more debt which buys a little more time. But each time more debt is required and less time is bought.

true,dageshi,null,null,"The changes you describe in order to make the euro work are an order of magnitude greater than the creation of the euro itself. More importantly those changes would require treaty changes and likely referendums in multiple countries most notably Germany. That includes btw the money printing (quantative easing) which is the basis of your fiat money argument, this is currently illegal for the ECB to do, although apparently laws inside the eurozone can be ignored if they are inconvenient so perhaps this one will be as well.

So the necessary changes in order to make the euro work properly are probably politically impossible at the moment and the amount of money in the rescue fund as it currently stands is too small to effectively contain all the issues resulting from the euro's faulty design.

It's not that the euro can't be fixed it's just that I cannot see the required changes being politically possible in the time frame available.",0,1318601711,null,0,false,0,c2rg4n5,t3_lao4i,t1_c2rg4n5,t1_c2rftyj,1427730989,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
