Un cercle infernal les condamne à continuer de se prostituer pour payer leurs arriérés. Entravant ainsi les processus de réinsertion, comme l'action des associations qui les aident, l'Etat encourt de nouveau le qualificatif de proxénète...

&gt;**Les « bénéfices non commerciaux » (BNC)** 
sont une catégorie dans laquelle rentrent principalement les revenus tirés d'une activité libérale (le Conseil d'État donne deux critères pour vérifier que l'activité est libérale : la personne la pratiquant ne doit pas avoir le statut de commerçant et il doit y avoir prépondérance de l'activité intellectuelle). L'article 92 du CGI assimile à des BNC les profits provenant de « toutes occupations, exploitations lucratives et sources de profit ne se rattachant pas à une autre catégorie de bénéfices ou de revenus ». Il en est ainsi des revenus de professions non officiellement répertoriées (par exemple : mage, prostituée, etc.) ou pour les sommes d'origine inexpliquées (sommes pour lesquelles le contribuable n'apporte aucune justification).

&gt;Le contribuable note le chiffre d'affaires dans une case prévue à cet effet sur la déclaration d'IR normale et le bénéfice net est calculé par l'administration forfaitairement par application, sur le chiffre d'affaires déclaré, d'un abattement de 34 %.

Highly paid or highly technical/scientific jobs are rarely decided on terms of ""who wants less money"". Therefore you are most likely the most qualified person to do it. As those jobs usually are huge multipliers (e.g. a bad CEO screws up a company, a bad professor produces bad students, ...), it's in the countries best interest to get the cream of the crop. + with that salary you are a net-contributer to the country.

Also, unemployment is mostly bad in the low qualified population, so you won't be taking away a job of those where jobs are scarce.

Can't help you though with the problem. The only person I knew who tried it (Hotel) failed.

AFAIK it's the company that wants to hire you that has to show that you are in fact the most qualified (by far) candidate to do the job. A practice that's not uncommon if they really really REALLY want you, is to publish a job description that basically only fits you (y'know, fluid in english, international work experience, preferably USA, ...).

As she is at the moment struggling with the mandatory German exam to get a residence permit, we already gathered information about how it will be with getting a job.

The procedure indeed implies a control, if there is no German, who would fulfil the requirements. 

First, the non-EU-citizen has to find a possible employer and reports that employer to the Ausländerbehörde. They then forward the request to the Arbeitsamt, which contacts the possible employer with a form, that he has to fill. (*In another case, my mother just was the possible employer for a woman from Romania; she had to fill the form*) With this form, the employer outlines the position, the salary and such. In it there also happens to be a question, which is of great importance. It asks, whether the employer wants exactly this person or if he would be also happy with another applicant with the same qualification. 

The answer to this may not be the first, as the Arbeitsamt will definitely deny the request then, since there is no chance for a German to apply for the job as well.

So the answer has to be the latter (even though both sides obviously know, that it's not true (*as it was the case of my mother*)). Then the Arbeitsamt has six weeks of time to send unemployed persons with roughly fitting qualifications to the employer, who has to evaluate their adequacy. 

If, after six weeks, there was no fitting person, and the employer is able to explain, why the persons didn't fit, the non-EU-citizen can have the job.

In such a scenario it's obviously necessary to find an employer who wants the non-EU-citizen so badly, that he is willing to follow this procedure in every point.

In the case of my mother, nobody applied within these six weeks, which made it unnecessary to demonstrate, why she was better qualified than a German, as in right_then's case.

I can contact my mother for further information about the process, if you need it. I will also try to get a copy of that form.",0,1301556693,null,0,false,0,c1n5tju,t3_gf2xo,t1_c1n5tju,t3_gf2xo,1427027771,4,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,4

true,[deleted],null,null,"My girlfriend is currently doing the program. We're over in Asturias, very similar climate, we're neighbors. A lot of great hiking and food.

I dunno if you lived in Spain or not before, but here are some lessons we learned coming from one Auxiliar and one student:

Pick up some private English lessons if you plan on traveling, and really, going out and doing things in general. The stipend is good, but it's not plentiful. 15 euros/hour is the going rate, but we both have lessons that pay a little under that (but I do know some people that charge more). Try to get on the lesson bandwagon when you arrive and have some money saved before you come. Here in Asturias, at least, there were a lot of problems with the Auxiliares getting paid for the first five months or so, but now they're on track. Problems like, for example, they didn't see their first paycheck until late November, I think. And they didn't pay on-time for a couple months after that. Don't worry though, there are plenty of opportunities for lessons. Find out what the regional classifieds are, post ads around the city, ask the teachers you work with (two of my students are children of the teachers my girlfriend teaches with, and my other one is from someone those teachers know). English lessons are everywhere. You can take as little or as much as you want. Most, if not all, Auxiliares I know teach outside of school.

Make friends with people in the program (in your region/city), especially people from previous years. You can share ideas. It'll make your job a lot easier.

I dunno what we encountered as some of our growing pains. Get Spanish roommates if you can. It'll help you improve your Spanish a ton, since you'll be teaching English a lot of the time. 

Travel ALSA for non-long distance trips. The bus system is very cheap. 60 Euros from Madrid to Oviedo one-way through RENFE. 60 Euros round-trip through ALSA. It takes about the same amount of time, if not longer. There are some occasions where you need to use RENFE to get to places. Fortunately, you can fly RyanAir from Santiago if you need to go anywhere substantial. I would recommend ALSA for when you initially arrive because you have to pay extra for any checked bags. And they only allow one carry-on. Plus you get to see the countryside while on the bus.

Travel a lot. And eat a lot. Especially while traveling.
