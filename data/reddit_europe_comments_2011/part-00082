But don't worry, it's easy to master and can make traveling around Paris much easier! You can check out a guide for taking it here : http://goparis.about.com/od/transportation/ss/Metro_and_Buses_2.htm

(btw, your hotel seems to be closest to Saint George &amp; Notre Dame [green] and Cadet [light pink])

Alrighty then, Rue Mouffetard, as already suggested, is a great street filled with little stores and restaurants. It's a street close to a whole bunch of things to see. Place D'Italie, which has its own mall and christmas decorations, is just near Mouffetard. Le Mosquee is also a really cool place nearby as well. Next to the Plant Gardens and Natural Museum of History, here you can smoke some shisha or go down stairs and have some tea/pastries with the mosque's birds. 

Also, right now in France Christmas markets are sprouting up everywhere. They're nice to visit and filled with French specialties such as tartiflette, vin chaud, crepes, and foie gras. I know of three in Paris right now: Place D'Italie, Montparnasse Tower/Galeries Lafayette, and Champs-Elysées. 

Meanwhile, closer to your side of town, I'll admit I don't know it too well, you can visit Le Sacre Coeur, Le Moulin Rouge, and the diner from that movie Amelie. 

Montparnasse Tower has the best view of Paris, in my eyes at least, and is only seven euros for adults over 20.

And yeah, eating out in Paris can be a bit expensive. Kebab and Crepes/Galettes are your best bets for eating out cheap, though I'm sure there are some cafes with daily specials that are budget friendly (I tend to just shop at Monoprix/Casino/Franprix because it's the cheapest way to eat!). Definitely be sure to visit a French artisan boulangerie, or three, though! They're fantastically delicious, each with their own pastries and breads, and they're usually not too expensive. 

Now I made you a Google Maps map of the places I can recommend myself: http://i.imgur.com/b6DQk.png

P.S. The Street to see on Ile St. Louis is named Rue St. Louis en L'Ile.

P.P.S. Sorry if this is a bit unspecific and erratic. Paris is a great place and I could tell you a million things you could do, taste, see here. I hope you have a good time!

Farmland can be expensive, you will have to lease the ground and pay your own rent, and you won't be sure to make enough profit to make a living.

My cousin has operated an organic farm in Bavaria (Munich area) for a couple of years, but they were forced to give it up two years ago because the numbers just did not add up anymore. They studied agriculture at an university here, knew the market and had all the tools, had (financial) support by the rest of the family... but in the end it was just not enough.

I would say that the chances are probably better in east germany because population is shrinking, rent is cheap and the cost of living is not as high as in western germany.

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"If you presented the average european with the true benefits of a federal europe, they would demand it.

The only people who don't want it are the corrupt politicians who take bribes on the side and waste your tax money and their mindless followers who are not capable of critical thinking.

Look around you.. every election in every country focuses on the very same ""issues"" over and over for many years now.. and nothing ever gets done about it. Stop being sheep.. the politcians will never care about you personally so it doesn't really matter if someone in your country is running the show, someone in another country.. or no one at all (like Belgium until very recently). At the end of the day, a federal europe will have positive consequences for you.

Think about something you complain about your country all of the time and compare it to other countries in europe.. maybe internet connection speeds/prices or whatever.. it doesn't matter how big or small the issue is... in a federal europe it would be something that would have to be changed to be on par with other countries.

You can make a whole list of things that will benefit you personally... unified postal services, vat etc etc will allow you to buy things from all of europe without any form of discrimination no matter which EU state you are in.

You can say that this is possible with today's structure, but you need to understand that the way the ""free market"" works in the EU right now benefit the people that import/export things and not really you personally, simply because there is no reason for the importer of a product to give you a better price because he's getting it cheaper.. because fuck you. It sounds cruel and bad.. but that's what it comes down to in very simple terms ""because fuck you"".

Oh and the other thing is... a federal europe would have much more power in the international scene... look at this organized crime the US government is trying to support by making a new law for the internet right now which would allow the corporate MAFIAA to do whatever they want on the internet. One thing is for certain.. the USA will fail eventually.. maybe tomorrow.. maybe next month.. maybe next year.. maybe in 50 years.. maybe in 100 years, but it will happen. Who would pick up the role as the ""sane superpower"" after they fail? Russia? China? India? There is a much better entity which is probably much more sane than the USA _today_: The EU... federalizing it would just be making it official on paper -- and just like that.. if the EU was federalized today, it would officially become the largest economy in the world.. on paper (even though it technically is already.. but they don't want anybody to know that).

Basically.. it's either unite together or fail horribly alone in a few years. I definitely know which world I want my future children to grow up in... the one where the EU is running the show.. a world where freedom of speech is respected, women are equal, and a world where only criminals carry weapons.

Everyone has their own reasons for wanting a federal europe.... it's entirely possible that in my small rant I became a bit incoherent, however there is literally no justification you can make about federalization being bad other than diplomatically saying ""my country is superior to yours and I hate all of you.. so I don't want to have anything to do with you"". Think about it.. we all grew up with basically the same type of education, we live EXACTLY the same way -- but a lot of us talk a different language. And you know what's funny? Here we are duking it out.. agreeing and disagreeing about stuff in 1 language that we can all understand.

So if you are a vocal anti-european.. I ask you... WHY? Why can't we all just be called europeans.. get together and drink german beer, eat dutch cheese, eat swedish bacon and scottish sausages from french plates and then have some belgian chocolate while wearing italian clothes and sunbathing in the cypriot weather? (I'm sure I could have kept it going and mentioned all of the countries and some product they make.. but it's weird enough as it is :P)

Due to the Berlin wall there is still very little in the way of urban sprawl like you have in all western German cities (and that is what drives prices up). Brandenburg is also very beautiful, you got countless clean lakes and small villages. At the same time Berlin is only - obviously depending where you are - an hours drive away and it will soak up any organic produce you might have, the demand is still vastly greater then supply.

There are a few disadvantages though: The soil quality isn't that great in many parts, Brandenburg is basically a huge sand dune. And the people can be a bit grumpy and close minded.

Who brought in being against the EU into it, other than you?  The original claim was that the supposition that a *federalised* EU enjoyed wide popular support was suspect.  I still think it is, and I think anybody that claims otherwise needs to produce some pretty damning evidence to the contrary, which I think you have failed to do, to explain why so many referenda have failed, and why, as noted at the top of the thread, when given an opportunity to Federalise, Eurozone politicians are not pushing this route.

This may explain one failure, yet when multiple votes fail, this excuse becomes old pretty fast.

There was no way in hell that the Euro was ever going to succeed without a lot more fiscal oversight. This was blindingly obvious for anyone who cared to look.

This isn't about being a europhile or eurosceptic it boils down to very basic economics and an understanding of human behaviour. Any and every currency union that tries to do what the Euro did would fail.

Germanies agriculture is mainly centered in lower Saxony in relative proximity to Denmark and the Netherlands, which together make up a huge part of European farming and pig raising in general. Since my father is a farmer he has played through the idea of acquiring/starting a new farm from the ground up a few times with me in lower Saxony just for fun. I shall represent to you these numbers to show you that Lower Saxony is not the area to get into the agri-industry if you are not marrying into it or iheriting it. 
Now land prizes have been climbing some 5 - 10% per year based on population distribution, soil quality, suitability for growing corn and the distance to bigger factories. In our area prices for one hectar (100 x 100 meters) have gone up from 400€ per year to 600 - 800€ per year over a period of ten years. So what we calculated would probably be even more today. We came up with the new farmer probably needing anywhere between 1.5 and 2 million Euros for new buildings, machines and land if you actually wanted to buy some of the land. Lets say one pig barn with photovoltaic costs round about 500,000 and you want two of those. You would want to lay down better irrigation equipment and infrastructure, invest (if at all possible) a few hundred thousand in wind energy. Add to that the cost for machines and the learning period which it takes to integrate into the local community and get contracts, etc.  
This was for conventional farming, organic would obviously be smaller, but still very expensive in lower saxony.

The family visa allows you to come into France and apply for a Carte de sejour. Now this is not guaranteed that you will get the carte, but you have to do something pretty stupid to not get it (like get in trouble with the law or something like that).
Anyways, they issue you a 1 year carte. If you plan to stay for longer, you need to renew it every year for the first few year and after 3 or 4 years you can apply for a 10 year carte.

One thing, please get to the prefecture as quickly and get an appointment. There is a long backlog and you may have to wait to get your date to make the application. Once the application is in, you get a recipicé (not sure if I spelt it right), which is good while your papers are being processed.

So what Alice or Vodafone would be doing is renting the TAL for €10,20 from the DT. Still, they own (or rent from different companies, Versatel has a lot of fiber in the ground in Berlin) the rest of the cable and equipment. Making them more responsible for everything.

Just look for some papers published by them (these are mostly in English) and write down the name of the authors, then google for the name to look for their private practice. I think your problem is that the English-speaking population in Galicia is so low that therapists don't bother advertising that they speak English, even if they do.

Just to understand it fully, the natural state of people to exist in is individualism, people looking out only for themselves and not giving a fuck about each other.

Now, when some folks are strong united by culture, history, etc. and thus _trust_ each other, they can make some collective arrangements. This is where politics, the state etc. comes from. They are willing to spend some of their money on each other. They are willing to have common institutions. This kind of trust does not exist on the pan-EU level.

In fact the direction is the other way around, people are losing trust even inside countries and federal countries slowly growing apart. Yugoslavia blew up. The Lega Nord wants to make Northern Italy independent. Belgium might blow up. Scotland might become independent - I have heard even a lot of English people support that, they think they are spending money on them and don't like it. Outside Europe, Canada might blow up and Quebec might become independent. And so on.

That's not to say that having a texbook isn't a good idea, though, without one it's going to be hard to *master* the language. But with immersion, you're going to be able to buy bread rolls, fluently, faster than you can read the first chapter, and you're going to have an intuition for grammar before reading the book to the cover.

true,specofdust,UKGB,United Kingdom,"While in general I think Cameron ain't so great, I do agree with the resistance toward a financial transactions tax. That's just continental Europe pushing for a tax that will barely effect them - it's a tax on Britain and it's deeply unfair. It's being suggested because we're the only ones with a v. large finance industry, and I think that it's quite obvious that popular sentiment against the finance industry is the only reason anyone in the UK would put up with that crap.

That said, the UK public has gotten the UK into the political position it's in right now. By opposing the union so thoroughly at every single stage, our integration with it has been lessened, our participation in instruments of the EU has been minimised. We simply lack power, contacts, friends, at this stage. So we're left with the two unpalatable options of just bending over and taking it from the Germans - having one of our core industries taxed to pay far more than our share in Europe. But the other option is getting to input nothing to the process, and just having to hope that everything turns out OK in the long run, with a UK which becomes an outsider to at least the central Eurozone.

Non-participation due to public ill-will has screwed us, and because now that we're screwed, the plebs will resent the EU for that, and desire even less participation - like an arm which doesn't want to be part of a body. It's going to get worse.

I could honestly not give less of a crap. You have to understand that democracy is only a very small factor in rural society. Daily life is still dominated by other organizations like Farmers (official and inofficial organizations), clubs (sport, shooting, voluntary firefighters, in at least one of which almost everybody is a member, I was in three), social and blood ties between families, and the Stammtisch Kultur.  
On the last point I should probably elaborate: In villages between 500 and 2000 people in size everybody knows everyone and drinks/meets with everyone on a regular basis. What is going to happen in the village is decided over the course of time in informal meetings when people drink together.  
This obviously means that to have any influence you have to be in the right/any social circles, but it also means that anybody that steps out of line or does not contribute is shunned as well. Outsiders moving into our town either integrate or have no say. I once met a woman walking my dog and we got talking. I did not even know her name, she had lived in our town for 5 years, but attended none of the social gatherings, clubs or festivities.  
Many of these social rituals, like farmers exchanging their fields so their respective specialized machines and knowledge about crops becomes more effective have existed for a very long time. They were never written down or put into contract. They have begun crumbling now though, as land becomes more valuable rich people from outside the local community or estranged relatives inheriting land try to maximize the profit they get out of renting out land. That leads to a corrosion of social cohesion among the farmers in special, but we adjust.  
Our towns pretty good soccer club and the even better soccer club of the neighboring bigger town are financed by rich people who pay for parts of the infrastructure and reimbursements for the players. In return these rich people have more say in club decicisions. Our soccer club for example especially focuses on women's soccer since that is an interest of our sponsor.  

You could call this a corrupt system since money is also given to people like the garbage men (40€ plus alcohol per year for my family), the postman (20€ plus alcohol per year), the schoolbusdriver and almost everybody else, but the system is selfregulating and fairly liberal. You help those in trouble, those without the means do not contribute as much and hard work is recognized for what it is.  

As I already said, as people and children move through the world more often, as farming becomes MUCH less important and the economy globalizes on local scale (interaction with other countries and states has been normal for a much longer time) this social cohesion breaks down. And we already see first signs of alternative measures of self-government evolving. For now my comment still holds pretty true though.  

tldr: If there is enough money to go around, people drink enough alcohol and social cohesion is strong enough the lack of parlamental democracy does not face anybody. It is more of an informal direct democracy with more power in the hands of those who contribute the most to society. The system is corroding though and will probably see an expansion of already beginning change.",0,1323344854,null,0,false,0,c36807h,t3_n3rld,t1_c36807h,t1_c365upq,1427989586,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

It used to be a great place to start up a weird bar, or music venue because rents were so low, but now much of the interesting haunts (like the White Trash Beachbar) are being bought out and turned into condos. Germans also seem to think trendy and hip means bringing some big name washed out artist from the 60s to town, to play in expensive venues with lots of lighting and ""production"", and play ""the favorites"". Or latin jazz bands from South America, who do supermarket versions of ""The Girl From Ipanima"". I'm in my 60s so I'm not the best commentator on what there is to do there.

Very nice to bike around, and lots of green, lots of beer gardens. But, it's a crap shoot. This summer the good weather never really came. It was very difficult to find a string of 2 or 3 days at any time of the week that were good. Completely unpredictable so impossible to plan. Frisco has very dependable weather. It's customary for Berliners to complain about the weather, and say ""this is the worst year yet"". It's sort of a standing joke, because they say it every year. Berliners aren't known for their friendliness either (vs. Bavarians), but I haven't seen much crankiness.

I will be blunt. What exactly do you think ""our own destiny"" is?
From what I can tell, our long term destiny, if we go it alone is to be a gnat in the world, to dwindle into obscurity and irrelevance. We are just so small as nations go, and while we're one of the more productive in the world, simple population size is going to reduce us to negligible in time.
Call me selfish, but I do not want that.

This half in/half out of the EU thing we have going on, it seems unstable and unwise to me. Sure, maybe we can manage it, but that means being strongly affected by the economic policies and activities of the rest of the EU without having a real say in it. And if we don't manage it, we either fall out with the EU, and we'll see how badly we do then, or fall into it as a latecomer, when many of the important decisions will have already been made without our voice or vote on them, and too late to do a thing about it.

What we're talking about right now are suggestions that the EU might implement a Tobin tax within the EU as no one else is going to be the first one to do it and it really should be done to help prevent another crisis of this sort, however no one expects the UK to accept this so we will of course opt out, which we will on the basis that we will not accept it unless it is global.

From personal experience, if they *really* like you, they are going to club you on the head and drag you back to their cave. But it'll take 'em a minute to decide first.

Don't start asking for phone numbers and dinner or lunch dates straight away. A meal is too long, awkward, and intimate for a first encounter (bear in mind that in the US we eat a meal in 30 minutes max, whereas it's an hour and a half minimum here.)

Constantly remind yourself to talk quieter in public and play possum. The French are very discreet and we Americans are anything but. Your accent and attempts to butcher the language can be perceived as ""cute"" and will play in your favor if you're careful and don't overdo it.

Would you mind explaining that? I don't recognize the argument.

&gt; And for the argument of moving elsewhere, it's true for all taxes, but it's not a reason to abolish all the taxes.

But this is a different situation, because the tax is not to raise revenue, which could be done in any of a number of ways, but to reshape the way in which the financial system works. To restate that, normally the question of taxes is about raising enough revenue without damaging competitiveness (a sort of Laffer curve argument, and then including private earnings on top). But this tax is to reduce instability, to discourage certain practices. But those practices would immediately move elsewhere, and continue operating outside Europe, with the same level of risk, but without the benefits being accrued within the continent. That is why it seems like an essentially vindictive move by the rest of Europe against Britain.

&gt; Finally, about each country setting their own tax, it depends on the point of view again. Those who want to go toward more federalization don't think like you. 

Europe faces a major danger of becoming monolithic, and gambling its future success on the competitiveness of a single model. We no longer live in the post-WWII world where there was the first world and the rest. There are now no barriers to developing countries taking industries wholesale from Europe, and Europe must compete or die.

The World Bank has some [relevant statistics](http://ddp-ext.worldbank.org/ext/LIS/LISIndicatorSel). 

To me, it looks like mothers in the Netherlands [do work](http://i.imgur.com/lnEkr.png), at least many more of them do than e.g., in Germany, so there are enough of them included in the stastistics to make a dent. But the number of hours worked for Dutch women with children is [much lower](http://i.imgur.com/s5b8d.png) than in other countries.

Put differently, it's a mix of cultural and economic factors paired with the way those statistics are set up. They're rich enough to be able to afford to work less, but still want to work, so they show up in the statistics. Germany stands out for its very low employment figure for mothers, but since they stay home they don't show up in the statistics.

true,proborc,NETH,The Netherlands,"Yes, I was just demonstrating the conservative way the Dutch behave. 

The discussion on LGBT in the Netherlands is already on the other edge. There is - as far as I can see - hardly any LGBT discrimination in the Netherlands. But there are people who are morally (usually because of religion) objected to gay marriage. So, if they are a wedding official, they refuse to marry gay people. 

Marrying is quite the ceremony in the Netherlands. You don't marry in the church, but at the town hall. It is a state marriage, where you first get to know the official who is going to marry you, several weeks before the ceremony. But the debate is whether you should be free to refuse to marry gay couples. (Of course the gay couple gets an alternative wedding official.) This is a kind of no discrimination/freedom of beliefs-debate. The question is: How much of your own moral code can you display in your work? Personally, I think freedom of beliefs should prevail in this matter, permitted that the couple still can get married. 

The Dutch are pretty open minded, but yes, it will be difficult to build good friendships. Although a lot of people speak English, for hanging out and having a good time, they prefer Dutch. And what I have seen among foreign students is that they stick together. In the Netherlands, the French drink wine on their 'French Student Society'. The Chinese stick together, talking Chinese and the Germans stick together to drive back to Germany every weekend. Perhaps this is caused by the fact that a lot of people coming over don't know Dutch - which makes it unattractive to introduce them to a group of friends.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"It's relative to the EU average (100). In countries where the index says 50, the value produced per hour worked is half the EU average, in countries where it say 200 it's twice the EU average. This is adjusted for how much people work in a country.

Productivity is output per input, in this case GDP per hour worked. You calculate it like this for country X:

[(GDP of country X) / (total hours worked in country X)] / [(GDP of the EU) / (total hours worked in the EU)]

Where ""total hours worked"" is not per employee or per capita, but that of all workers taken together.

To make it more clear, consider the following different measures of GDP:

 * GDP of a country. This is the total, big countries have much higher figures than smaller ones, simply because there are more people.

 * GDP per capita. This is the first figure divided by the number of residents. Now, really tiny countries like Luxembourg or Liechtenstein look great, because many people commute to work there but live outside of the border -- they contribute to a country's GDP without counting as a resident.  
More importantly, countries where people spend a lot of time at work and where many people work full time look better as well -- you work more, you get more done.

 * GDP per hour worked. This is how much people actually produce while working one hour. Somebody making €1000 per month, but only working an hour per day for it will now look much better than somebody working full time for €3000, because she has a higher productivity, even though she doesn't earn as much.

Take the US and the Netherlands, for example. Not surprisingly, the US has a much higher GDP, because there are so many more Americans than there are Dutch. Per capita, the US still has a higher GDP, because those crazy Americans work their asses off. But per hour worked, their GDP is almost exactly the same, even adjusted for PPP (what you can actually buy for your salary, i.e., adjusted for ""damn, you pay *how much* for a beer? That's insane!""). [[Source](http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=LEVEL)]",0,1323381746,null,0,true,0,c36di1m,t3_n4tyn,t1_c36di1m,t1_c36cdy8,1427992250,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

That is fairly similar to the debate in Brazil, though gay marriage is not yet legal, only civil unions. The religious groups are vehemently fighting to keep the gay community from getting marriage (in addition to the discriminatory/hate crime portions), claiming infringements on their freedom of religious expression. It is a very complicated topic, but overall I agree with you. A church/pastor shouldn't be forced to officiate marriages that they disagree with religiously. However, I think that if the marriage is being done by a state official, that person should remain impartial as they are representing the state, and the state should not be allowed to discrimate. It seems like it is more complicated in the Netherlands as the state official is the only person involved, instead of keeping the ceremony and legal parts separated as is sometimes done in other places.

That is very interesting about the cultural segregation in the Netherlands. If I were to ever live there, I would definitely try to learn the language to assimilate myself better, which would improve that aspect of assimilation (getting to know the locals).

I disagree. This should be a partnership of nations. Britain seems to take the view that it should let what other countries do happen, unless it isn't great for us, in which case we complain. The French are putting pressure upon Germany to do the one thing that will solve this crisis, printing money, we could be doing the same. Instead we're solely focussed on looking out for number 1. We should be allied with the French right now, and yet the French and Germans are both opposed to us. We're handling this in an utterly awful manner.

&gt;the Germans signed up for the euro on the understanding that there would be no money printing

Yes, but there has to be. Everyone knows it, it's just the German people won't accept it because they're as economically clueless as every plebian population, and Merkel is far too pathetic a leader to just push ahead and do it anyway. That's where we, as the third biggest economy in the EU, come in. Look at the effect France have, and their GDP is not so massively different than ours. Britain could form the crucial counterbalance to the usual German populism. But instead we're stuck with this island nation mentality of not getting involved unless it benefits us, and not inputting unless there's something which might be a negative. Put simply, we add nothing. We're not constructive - we're the negative Nancy of the EU.

&gt;None. What difference can we make to it now? None.

That's so utterly defeatist. We are completely and utterly fucked if the euro goes down. I mean, we're already hitting 1930's style recession, if the euro goes down we're talking multiples of that. Life as we know it would be over. Britain has economic power. Our political power is massively reduced by a virtual policy of non-participation, but our economic power remains and we can use that to aid the French in their push for realistic and beneficial reform of the eurozone and the EU in order to save the euro and gradually improve the EU economy. Whether we like the EU or not is at this stage irrelevant. Our fate is tied to it whether we go fully federal or withdraw even more.

What's important for now is that we **try** to use what weight we have to improve matters, to prevent the eurozone collapsing (We **can** do something about this!) - not because it benefits some grand anti-sovereign EU bureaucrat goal, but rather because if we do not, we're going to see a decline in quality of life to a standard not experienced for several generations.",0,1323388176,null,0,false,0,c36emqy,t3_n4muh,t1_c36emqy,t1_c36bpme,1427992783,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I'm as frugal as they come but you're not equating food diversity and energy costs. Cooking your own food is fine and I do it always, but you must diversify or you'll be hurting soon (health). And take the added energy into account.

I can buy the cheapest spaghetti pasta for 50/60 cents (it has steadily risen near 20% these past months), salt for about 30 cents, rice for 1 euro (also rising), canned beans and tomatoes are also way past 1 euro each for big cans.

I did the math and even with just soup and vegetables, I wouldn't sustain just myself on less than 170 euros food-wise.

Just to put things into perspective, housing costs are 600 EUR, energy/water (GAS+Electricity+Water) are at 80 EUR and rising.
Daycare is another 150 EUR.

Food costs for a family of 3 are in the 400 EUR.

All these have risen some 10% this year and are due to rise even more with the changes in VAT and interest rates.

Social Security taxation will add further strain to this coming year. I have an old diesel car with low mpg ratio and little maintenance needed but the cost of a liter of diesel is pushing 1.50 EUR.

There is hardly anything left on the family budget. I know I'll have to scrape something soon coming January. I will probably start wearing a miners hat indoors to save energy.

Comparing peasants and feudal rule to the kind of systematic slave trade you created is a bit silly, isn't it?

You lack imagination then. What influence do most British people see them having in European politics? Pretty much nil.

I can promise you that if the people deciding how to resolve this crisis had been MEPs who commanded a majority in the EU Parliament we might be more inclined to care about a loss of influence. Every country's influence in the EU outside of France and Germany is pretty abstract- its just negotiations done behind closed doors.

The idea being that Germany wanted economic decisions to be made within the EU so that Britain could act as a long-term liberal counterweight to the more statist mediterranean countries, for instance to prevent this sort of talk:

&gt; Mr Sarkozy last week declared that Europe should not be a “dupe” when it came to global trade, and proposed EU import taxes to help pay for European welfare systems.

If the Eurozone proves to be the new grouping of choice I wonder how comfortable Germany and particularly the smaller Northern European countries will feel in ten years time. In essence, this is not just a conflict between Eurosceptics and Europhiles, but between Liberals and Socialists, and it is a pity that Cameron has been unable or unwilling to engage sufficiently to protect Britain ability to make its case to defend its beliefs, which it shares with many other European countries, in favour of global competitiveness through free trade and strong markets.

Our previous prime minister was rightly replaced because he was a catastrophically dimwitted liar. Who came to power by campaigning on the 'fact' that the crisis wasn't real. That it was just a ploy by the former government. A man who then did nothing for months while our money was running out. A man who for months procrastinated in enforcing the needed measures to relieve the pressures on our economy. A man who through half measures and an unwillingness to harm his party's power base (public sector workers) put the private sector in an unprecedented depression. A man who after getting the deal he should be pushing for from day one of his government chose to hide behind the skirt of the Greek people by blabbering on about a referendum. And he was replaced absolutely within the rules of our constitution when members of his own party started withdrawing their support.

And as for the referendum? If he actually gave a shit about the will of the people he'd have called for a referendum as soon as the situation became unrecoverable.

true,grandom,EURO,European Union Federationalist,"Sorry for the following wall of text.

In September of '09 the (equally idiotic) outgoing prime minister declared general elections. He said that our money had run out and that he needed a fresh popular mandate to enforce the measures needed to recover. He was actually trying to bail out of this mess and enjoy his retirement but that's beside the point right now. Papandreou then ran his campaign on the argument that and I quote verbatim ""The money is there"" that some housework was all that needed to be done. So considering he later was found to have been in talks about the subject with various members of the ECB and IMF and was well aware of the situation he was absolutely, knowingly lying to the people. Of course he won the elections.

Then as if to keep appearances up and seem actually surprised he did nothing for months while our funding sources kept drying up. Only when the last drop was expended did he actually acknowledge the situation. Now is the time when an actual knowledgeable and democratic leader recognizes reality. The numbers simply do not add up. The only way out is through heavy reforms and debt re-structuring. Now is the time to go the Greek people and ask. Do we stay on board the EU and do what is needed or do we cut all bonds and try our luck alone? But no. He's too cowardly to be clear to the people. He's also too cowardly to push for debt restructuring in Europe. So he decides to go the way of the half measure. We are now at late spring, early summer of '10 and the first measures start taking place. Greece's no.1 fiscal problem is our huge, overly compensated public sector. A public sector his father created in his efforts to buy out the public during the '80s. A close second is our inefficient and retarded tax system also mostly staffed by his father's political army. So going after them was out of the question. What's a boy to do? Screw trying to save money, let's tax the shit out of everyone instead. Let's make up all sorts of extra taxes and append them to bills the people can't afford not to pay. Let's raise the VAT again and again. Well much to the surprise of no one these measures only managed to deprive the real economy of the already limited amounts of capital available. The economy contracted and tax revenues actually went down. The deficit got worse. This cycle happened another couple of times. Go to Europe, get some money, tax a little more. Meanwhile the public sector (his power base) remained largely untouched. None of the needed fundamental reforms happened. We kept floundering and getting deeper and deeper into depression.

Which brings us to the fateful days of October '11. The debt restructuring that should have been done a year and a half ago happens. Everyone breathes a sigh of relief. We're still getting screwed but at least there is a chance our efforts will have an effect. But this happened at a price. He actually has to start going after the public sector. He knows that this would mean his power base will turn on him. So being the genius that he is he brings up the referendum. He hopes to make the EU the villain and ""protest"" these cruel measures. He does this knowing that the people will vote FOR the measures. And that then he can enforce the needed laws hiding behind the people and minimizing his political cost. He doesn't even say what the referendum is going to be about. Every party in the parliament is against it except for the Communists. The people are against it in percentages above 70%. We know he doesn't really care what we want. He just needs an alibi.

Members of his party threaten to quit if he doesn't step down. The people are after his head for trying political tricks during such a huge crisis. And as is supposed to happen in a democracy when everyone wants you to leave, he stepped down. But not after dragging the process for another week again with stupid political ploys.

So you will excuse me for flying a bit off the handle whenever he's made out to be some martyr, overthrown for trying to do what the peope wanted.   ",0,1323448217,null,0,false,0,c36lbtw,t3_n60dw,t1_c36lbtw,t1_c36kr31,1427996022,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,TheMemo,null,null,"&gt; Maybe because in almost all European countries save for the UK, Euro-scepticism has been confined to the fringes of the political system time and time again.

Here is my perspective (as someone from the UK) on Euroskepticism.

The main point of contention, as Euroskeptics would have you believe, is about *Democracy.* The problem is, no one really knows what 'Democracy' is and Continental Europe has a very different idea of Democracy than Anglo-Saxon countries.

Democracy is a shit political system, only slightly better than those before it. Representative democracy comes in many forms, none of it particularly democratic when you consider the definition of the word. In order to avoid any serious discussion about the viability of Democracy as opposed to more direct, more modern and more radical types of government, each nation has created a cult around it - Democracy (now equated to 'freedom') is an emotional matter, an emotional choice to the common man. With that in mind, differences in what constitutes Democracy are akin to Protestant vs. Catholic arguments.

I would consider myself Euroskeptic because while I support not only a European Superstate but a proper One-World Government, I do not feel that the EU as it stands is the correct mechanism to bring us there. That, however, is a discussion for another time.

The very British causes of Euroskepticism, however, are easily understood. 

We are frightened that further integration will lead us to be sacrificed for the amusement of other European countries who hate us. We are right to fear this, because we are a very, very poor European citizen and it is quite right that the EU would not hesitate to damage us if it served the interests of the greater Union.

Consider that Britain is a client state of the US. Consider that we have used US technology to spy on EU states, not only for diplomacy, but to give the US greater leverage in economic matters, including spying on european companies. This has been investigated and understood to be the case by the European Parliament. Our membership of the Echelon network is, under EU treaties, illegal.

The UK is playing, and always has played, a dangerous game. While our national defence is dependent on the US, our trade is dependent on the EU. In order to deal with this, we have become dependent on a financial sector that is, effectively, asymmetrical and served, for a while, to make us less dependent on the EU in economic matters. Cameron's recent actions have been to ensure this status quo, not for the benefit of the City, but to ensure we are still not as dependent on trade with the EU. 

The UK is torn between two powers, neither of which have our interests in mind. Both of which would not hesitate to throw us under a bus if it was necessary. What would you do in the circumstances?

There are several, from the common market to passport free travel, and usually EU members are, or are in the process of becoming, members of all of them, unless they have negotiated exceptions as the UK likes to do.  
So, those rare exceptions aside, the other non-members are merely not members *yet*. Almost all of them are planning to become members in the coming years. This is why they have a strong interest in shaping the rules even before they join, because those decisions will affect them later.

Another reason is the question about having a ""Europe of two speeds"" or not, that is, whether it is desirable to have a group of core countries push ahead and integrate at a faster pace while the periphery lingers on.  
Countries that wouldn't be part of the core group generally don't like this idea, because it means that they lose influence. Right now, individual members can veto practically anything, but this will change soon when the Treaty of Lisbon takes effect. Imagine a meeting of the EU members that essentially works by non-core members joining the core countries after they had their own meeting, only to learn what the core has decided on and will be voting for as a block.  
But it's not just peripheral countries that don't like this idea, some of the core would prefer a larger group because their allies aren't part of the core group yet. For example, Germany likes to have fellow free-trade minded Poland on board to counterbalance French protectionist leaning tendencies.

It's not  town you would mention on a ""must see"" list of Germany, it's not an ugly town either. They have a technical University, so there's young/nightlife  - at least during the semester. You can expect good public transport (judging by the tram network +timetables), no night service, though.

100km to Berlin. Whatever you make of that. I know exactly nothing abotu the Polish side (Border is nearby). 

Winter sports (beyond cross-country skiing) sucks, most people go for Altenberg (150km).

i can do this all night, there are literally millions of sources to confirm this simple truth

and to say it again, your economy shifted from being an actual producer of real goods to a juggler of virtual money serving only a small elite. and instead of admitting that the very industry your nation so foolishly started to depend on is at the very core of this crisis you just continue to live in a complete state of denial and prefer to ignore it all instead of acting together with your neighbours to do something about it.

notice how britain has been in constant decay economically ever since thatcher broke your unions and your industry with it in the 80s? we managed to build up ex-socialist east germany to first-world standards (at a cost of over 1,5 trillion euros) in the meantime and still managed lots more economic growth than you guys

and finally:

""Killing the patient to cure the disease.""

if the patient keeps spreading a deadly disease to all around him, it might be best to do just that, and you are taking care of it yourself by opting out of european politics

one of the most important points about the founding of the european union was precisely to get states to act in common european interest instead of every-man-for-himself manner, this was clear to every participator of the lisboa treaties, if you really think that it was sold to you as a pure trade union your politicians and newspapers seem to have preferred to keep some vital information from you that everyone got. 

we for example have repeatedly agreed to things that are not necessarily in the best shortterm interest of our own nation, the german public widely opposed the bailout and we still went through with it because longterm its better to have rich and prosper neighbours than to let southern europe fall into economic chaos, but it takes leaders with balls to act boldly even against public sentiment from people who have no grasp of the overall situation (as most human beings do who didn't major in economics)

britain needs a plan how it will manage itself without the rest of the eu, not the other way round. even countries like greece and portugal, who have their part in the crisis as well and don't like what the eu forces upon them right now to get them back in  shape, still cooperate and work with everyone else much more than britain. and unlike you guys, they joined the euro and thus deserve and receive much more of our help than britain. if you choose independence from the eu(ro) club, thats what you get in all aspects of life. if you wanna keep the pound instead of joining forces then deal with your economic problems alone, thank you very much

cameron was the only one who announced even before the last summit that it was highly likely that he would veto. no one else came into these negotiations with such an egoistic sense of entitlement. even hungary, who complained loudly as well before the summit about certain clauses was willing to negotiate and make amends, sweden and others said they might have to consult their parliaments or people first, but britain walked in there with an attitude that guaranteed to make the summit fail.

he threatened everyone with a veto before the negotiations even started and probably couldn't have moved on the issue even if he wanted because he backed himself into a corner by making guarantees for the city of london without which he'd veto, thats not how civilized people negotiate, it's the kind of veto bullying america, china and russia usually pull over various un decisions regarding israel, iran etc

anyway, i said it before and i'll say it again, britain doesn't seem the least bit concerned with any eu interests that don't completely match its own agenda, as long as this remains the case, no one in continental europe needs britain as part of the eu club and britain should not expect any economic aid whatsoever if they keep preventing everyone else to do something about the core reasons for these crisis

There are some, which means there are too many. However, let's not do them the favor of blowing the risk out of proportion.

In the last federal elections, the NPD had 2.3% of the votes in Cottbus. This by no means does it mean all of those are violent (the NPD is a popular choice for ""protest voters""), but it can be used as an indicator for relative prevalence of right-wing ideology. Those 2.3% compare with 2.6% in the state of Brandenburg and 1.5% nationally.   
Brandenburg's Office for the Protection of the Constitution counts about 1,200 neo-Nazis and members of right-wing extremist organizations and rates 450 of them as violent.

Nationally in 2010, there have been 762 cases of right-wing violent crimes, including 6 attempted homicides and 638 violent assaults. About half of those cases were racist, the other half was mostly against political opponents. 66 of the cases happened in Brandenburg, or 2.74 per 100,000 population.

The imparfait is the tense for ""telling"" in the past.

For example a short story could be : ""Hier j'étais au supermarché et j'ai acheté du jambon"". The first verb is in imparfait, setting up the time referential where your action takes place. The second verb is passé composé because there is a notion of impact over the present, aka now that you've bought ham you've got ham. If you used imparfait like ""Hier j'étais au supermarché et j'achetais du jambon"", one would expect a following to that sentence.
