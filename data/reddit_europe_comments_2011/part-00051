I've actually found the most effective solution to stop these pests is to notice when one is approaching you (they will walk directly towards you), look them in the eyes, and shake your head. Most will stop at that point, but if they persist, a simple *""Non, merci""* usually does the trick. Like I mentioned though, I have had to shoulder/push them out of the way before.

On  commence avec les classiques HBO ( pour moi la chaine qui à révolutionnée les séries ) :

* Oz : Univers carcéral ultra violent, série assez réaliste et intelligente, fait passer Prison break pour candy chez les bisounours.

* The sopranos : Les mafieux, un classique. A voir au moins une fois, le classique

* The Wire : Série ""policière"". Peut être la meilleure série ? En tout cas très bien réalisée, ultra crédible et se regarde comme un documentaire, expliquant les liens de causes à effets du dealer du coin de rue au maire de la ville.

* Carnivàle : Indéfinissable, seulement deux saisons, une photo magnifique. 

* Six feet under : Découvert sur le tard, vaut vraiment le coup.

Dans la catégorie humour :

* Seinfeld : Pour tous les amateurs de HIMYM et TBBT , LE sitcom qui à tout commencé et qui n'a pas pris une ride ( sauf concernant les coiffures et les fringues )

* Curb your enthusiasm : Du même auteur , Larry david, génial

* Arrested devellopment : un petit bijoux

* The office US : Certains vous diront de regarder uniquement la version originale anglaise, c 'est vrai lla voir aussi, mais si vous avez le temps, steve carrell est très bon et le show devient une autre série que la version brit

Chez les beefs :

* Spaced : de ceux qui vous ont ammené shawn of the dead, que dire de plus

* Father ted : Irlandaise mais produit par les anglais, trois pretres sur une iles perdues à l ouest de l irlande, l une de mes séries préférées, le fait que j ai emballé en irlande la soeur de l auteur n a rien a voir a cela.

* Black books: Des memes auteur, un libraire alcoolique qui maltraite ces clients

* IT crowd: toujours du meme auteur, toujours tres bon.

* The office UK : Ricky gervais, que dire de plus

* Extras : Ricky gervais encore avec des guest stars de ouf


En moins drole toujours anglais :

* misfits : enfin une série réaliste sur le sujet ""gens normaux qui ont des supers pouvoirs tout d un coup"" oubliez heroes

* dead set : mélange de zombies ( qui courent donc pas vrais zombies a la romero mais bon ) et de tv réalité, un rêve.

Voila pour ma liste perso, j en oublie sûrement, et bien sûr , je ne sais pas si il est nécessaire de le rajouter, mais toutes ces séries sont à voir en VO.

On remarquera le manque de série française, ce n 'est pas de la mauvaise volonté, mais à coté des anglais, on est assez naze pour ca

""Ja mei"" is something between a sigh and ""oh my"" and ""whatever"". It can also mean something like a sighing ""well"". If you know the german word ""tja"". It's like that.

Some examples:

If someone is complaining to you about something which seems ridiculous to complain about, you can answer ""ja mei"". This would roughly ""translate"" to ""uhu... whatever"".

If you are annoyed and someone gives you some superficial advice, you can say in a sighing tone ""ja mei, und was jetzt?"". That'd be ""well, and what now?!"".

&gt;You decide to not be an ass

I think this type of scam is so effective because it is preying on visitors trying not to live up to the **bad tourist** image.  You are a visitor in a strange place, and you may feel a bit awkward not being able to speak the local language and bumping around with all of these other foreigners who stick out like a sore thumb.  You see other tourists grunting and speaking loudly to merchants in a clearly insensitive manner.  The thought of having to deal with throngs of people like you in your local country makes you feel even less pleased with yourself.

And suddenly, an opportunity to turn the tide appears.  You can perform a small gesture to prove that you are not an insensitive, selfish clod.  You have the opportunity to be a good ambassador in this strange land!

And then it all goes south.  

Your effort to be altruistic and charitable has turned into a humiliating (at best) episode.  Now, not only do you feel much much worse about yourself for having been scammed, you have gained a negative experience easily turned into personal contempt for the country, the people, traveling in general, etc etc.  

For me the thing to remember is that these scams happen everyday in your own town/city but not only are you probably not a preferred target and you know how to avoid them.  That person from disadvantaged background X who comes up to you asking for gas money so that she can get home to feed her kids...you likely have no ethical problem with dismissing her because you know the score.  

Of course the whole situation sucks and it *is* surprising that a city that relies so much on tourism doesn't do more to crack down on this type of activity going on in plain sight.   But  the tourists just keep on coming, and I guess if you suppress one type of lucrative activity it is likely to pop up nearby in a modified form.  

**TL;DR:**  It stinks to be scammed when you are just trying to be a good person.  Hopefully it won't too negatively color your view of Paris, the French, Europe or travel.

The same goes with musicians in the subway. There are officially endorsed musicians (they play in the corridors and have some kind of badge displayed) and low-grade unauthorized musicians (those play in directly in the wagons). Do not give money to those playing in the wagons, they're most likely affiliated to the same kind of mafia than those who drop cards. (plus, their music is utter crap)

Liebster Hase! 28.8.43
Heute Sonnabend früh kam Gottlob der Manöverkoffer an, ich dachte fast, er sei mitverbrannt! Hab also vielen herzlichen Dank. Den braunen Rock brauchst du nicht zu schicken, ich meinte den Strickrock zu der karierten Jacke passend. Aber vorläufig habe ich ja genug anzuziehen u. kann mir ja im Oktober noch einiges mitnehmen. Viel lieber hätte ich auch den dunkelblauen Mantel, den mir Frl. Maneim ändern soll, zum trennen. -Das H. an dich auch noch einen Brief schrieb, finde ich ja zu albern, übrigens gibt ihnen ? Fr. Scheuermann(?) wahrscheinlich ein Zimmer ab, im Oktober. Du bist ja wirklich zu bewundern, daß du bei den nahen Bombeneinschlägen gepennt hast, aber es ist immerhin beruhigend. Nürnberg hatte ja so einen schweren Angriff gehabt gestern u. hof-

fentlich brauchst Du nicht hin. Schicke mir doch bitte ein Glas Marmelade u. Briefpapier u. erinnere Veitnagel an die Eier. Sonst geht es uns gut: Wir baden noch jeden Tag u. ich will es durchhalten so lang es geht. Heute war d. Luft sehr kalt; aber d. Strasse herrlich warm. Dreifelds(?) sehe ich täglich und es ist immer sehr nett mit ihnen. 

There is another sentence after that, but I can't decipher it. Probably some greeting.

The postcard is adressed to some

Try not to put too much emphasis on the r rolling. 

Maybe this will help if you want to eventually roll the r: Start by making a normal english r sound (hold it there: ""rrrrrrrrr"") then transition into the r from Paris plus the german word you want to say (ex. ""rot""). 
Notice that for ""Paris"" your tongue would be at the front of your mouth but for an english ""red"" it will be at the back somwhere.
As your tongue moves over the roof of your mouth from the back to the front you should make a more German sounding R.

Giuliano and his wife (an American woman who visited and never left) are very kind and hospitable people. They will treat you right and get you in the know with all the locals. Highly recommended.

true,TheAlgebraist,null,null,"I will also tell you this much... two weeks in Firenze is a long time. If you want to save money, and see more without so much traveling I recommend the following given the locations you've listed:

1. Fly into Rome and stay for 3 nights, 4 if you really are into the shopping side of things (I wasn't). You are going to want to dedicate a whole day to the Vatican museum because you'll be exhausted when you're done with it. Another day will likely be spent seeing the old ruins on Palatine Hill and the Colosseum (though I did it in an afternoon it was rushed). A third day can be spent on some world class shopping if you can afford it and any other historical sights.

2. Train up to Cinque Terre, though with two weeks I recommend at least one night and two days in Siena, an ancient Tuscan hill town and famous for its medieval horserace. It's pedestrians only and extremely historically relevant as it was Firenze's major competition for several hundred years. You'll be able to unwind here, get away from the big city scene. It's also on the way to Firenze from Rome.

3. Back to the big city in Firenze... do at least 5 days here. You'll fall in love with the charm of the place even if you're not spending any money. The Duomo, the Uffizi Gallery, the Ponte Vecchio and the fact that it's a college town make it a real cultural treat. Plus there are a lot of americans when trying to speak italian gets to be too much.

4. Cinque terre by train, about 2 hours from Firenze, and again, time to unwind from big city. I'd do 3-4 days here. Hiking, chilling, swimming if it's warm enough. Gorgeous country side but not a lot else unless its summer. Still worth seeing beyond a doubt.

5. now here's the thing about venice... it's amazing, nothing like it anywhere else in the world. The museums and old palaces are something to behold, not to mention the canals. But it's expensive, and the most touristy town you'll encounter by far. The food will be crap, the hawkers will be out in force selling cheap crap. And getting lost is a definite. Plus lodging is hard to find on a budget. 2-3 nights here max to see everything before you get sick of the drawbacks (again, this is assuming  you are on  a budget).

Travel everywhere by train, don't even go near cars. There's no need! Buy an American Student Eurail pass online. They're cheap and easy to use. And don't even try to rent an apartment, on a budget you want to rent rooms in a hostel. You can get large bunk rooms or smaller rooms of four to six beds usually for around 40 euro a night.

As for Versailles itself, I have studied their for two years. Their isn't much to do, most of the bars are located at the ""Place du Marché"" but are not that cool. But I guess that you'll have a great time with the other architecture students.

Paris is just minutes away: there are 3 main stations that will get you close to wherever you want to go. (the ""Rive droite"" station will get you to St-Lazare in 15mn, the ""Rive Gauche"" to Montparnasse in 15mn, and the RER C at ""Chantiers"" follows the Seine - 30mn to go to St Michel)

As for a unique cultural event, you have the ""Grandes eaux de Versailles"" during the spring-summer: it's the only time when they open all the fountains of the Chateaux's garden, while playing some classical music (+ a show at night, IIRC).

Books: go to ""Gibert"". It's specialized in student books, and if you arrive early enough, you can buy used versions for a cheap price.

true,MeraK,Zirlande,Irlande,"As the other commenters said, there isn't much to do in Versailles per se ; but you will have no problem going out to Paris, as the town is essentialy a big transportation hub for the western part of the Ile-the-France. I lived a few months just near Versailles Rive-Droite, which is one of the three rail stations of Versailles. I could usually reach friends in Paris in less than an hour at any time. 

As for Versailles itself, and apart from the Château and the Jardins (which you're obviously going to visit), the rest of the town is actually quite nice too. Don't miss the quartier Saint-Louis ; and also the area near the Place du Marché, where there are a few nice restaurants. I was recently advised ""Le Chien Qui Fume"", but haven't tested it yet. Also, there is the Marché itself, which is there everyday, and is quite renowned. 

If you want to grab a beer : go to Paris :) only half-joking here ; I tested only one local pub called the Pub'O'Paris, it wasn't great, loud music and quite expensive.


Shopping tips :
There aren't any big hypermarkets in/near the town, but there are a few local supermarkets (Monoprix, Super U, Franprix). Be prepared to spend more than you would expect for food there. If you've got a car, you could go to Auchan at Velizy 2 (very big shopping mall 10km away, there is also a bus i think but never tried it). For your clothing/home supplies/whatever, you can go either to Velizy 2, or to Parly 2, another shopping mall well deserved by bus.

As far as I remember it is easier to obtain a work permit/visa if your parents are German citizens, not sure if that applies to residents or step family, too.

Anyway, I just wanted to note that the American style Resume is becoming more popular here in Germany, too, especially if you apply at engineering firms and/or large international companies, which you'll most likely have to do if you don't speak German yet.

Maybe this can help you, too.

Signs that a girl likes you:  Playing with hair, laughing at your jokes, trying to be near you, sometimes she may try to tease you about something. I think flirting here is much more subtle and doesn't follow rules as much.

To make her like you avoid being the ""arrogant"" American. Do not compare Germany to America all the time. Rather try to find something about the culture that you really appreciate (and do not chose beer) and talk about that with her. Also ask her about why she/the Germans do things the what they do and how she/the Germans thinks about certain topics. Girls here like to talk about ""deep/philosophical"" stuff rather than just the latest movie or rather than hearing a story about how cool you are.

Use your American friendliness and your positive can-do attitude on her when all the Germans are like:""That will never work out"". This positive attitude will win big over the German general grumpyness. Make her laugh a lot and suggest fun things to first do in a group of friends (Grillen am See, going to see a town nearby, climbing, bowling, etc) and later check subtly if she would be willing to go somewhere alone with you. You will not impress with the typically American dinner-and-a-movie-date, but you should rather do something that will make both of you laugh a lot (amusement park, Kirmes) There, find a good opportunity for a first kiss. Then you can tell her that you think she is wonderful. If she does not avoid you after this, she likes you.

Hope this helps.

Les regles à respecter absolument :

- Le code de la route. 
Les piétonts aussi se basent dessus. Quand je me fait gueuler dessus parceque je traverse et que je suis dans le passage d'un vélo à pleine vitesse au feu rouge, j'ai envie de lui mettre mon poing dans le tronche et lui faire bouffer son dérailleur.

- Si vous roulez sur les trottoirs (parfois il n'y a pas le choix, il faut le reconnaitre), roulez a la vitesse d'un marcheur. Prendre le coin d'une rue pour se faire percuter par un cycliste a 30km/h peut être **mortel**.

- PAS D’ÉCOUTEURS DANS LES OREILLES. Le son est de loin le meilleur atout pour évaluer votre entourage.

- DES FREINS EFFICACES, SURTOUT UN FREIN SUR LA ROUE AVANT. J'adore le look des fixies, mais leur capacité niveau freinage est pathétique. pouvoir s'arréter en 5m est absolument essentiel.

- Concernant les voitures : se conduire comme elles voulaient toutes vous tuer.
- Concernant les piétons: se conduire comme si un piéton apparaissait dravant vous instantanément.

Sinon, roulez et faites vous plaisir. 

Je vois tous les jours des abruti(e)s qui manquent de se faire tuer ou qui manquent de me rouler dessus. Faites un effort. Il est tout a fait possible de se faire plaisir en ville sans se conduire comme un demeuré.

I don't think that's going to be needed to solve the current crisis, though, which is 90% European politics stumbling over a US economic PsyOp, and 10% actual problems. They're in way deeper shit than any EU member, when you consider private debt as part of the equation, which, in the end, it is, because every single EU country could pay off all its debt by taxing its populace. The US can't. Selling off their military would work, I guess, but then I don't think they'd like that idea.

Most people will prefer eurobonds. As *real* AAA as German bonds, acceptable interest at palatable durations... and all that is assuming that Germany *will* be giving out its own bonds, it's not too impossible that it's going to be indepted less than the GDP cutoff. A 20% one-time tax on citizens property, with generous allowance of 500k Euro, would pay for *all* state debt[1].

If the Dollar crashes, America will be unable to import any raw materials, not to mention any kind of products, hence the little bit of actually product-producing industry that you have left will crash, too. Or do you really think anyone would accept a crashed dollar at any other exchange rate than the value of paper it's printed on? Have much fun getting out of that hole. I don't think it's impossible, but It's going to take, even if political circumstances are optimal (which they won't be), at least 10 years to get up to current levels, again.

Also, there's no *federal* VAT. State and municipal sales taxes, OTOH, definitely exist. US taxation is death by a thousand cuts, not a single percentage somewhere anyone could seriously mind.

You see, the problem is that the US doesn't own that much of itself. That is, chunks of state bonds each large enough to completely crash US bonds if dropped, are held by both Japan and China, and then a wide spread over the rest of the world. And the little that *is* owned by US citizens isn't in wide circulation, because the median US citizen is way too broke to own it, but by a couple of super-rich... which, as you may have noticed, got their ways not to get taxed.

In other news, I noticed yesterday that Gold is virtually en par with Platinum. Speak of bubbles, there.

The limited bonds solution *hinges* on the fact that the percentage of GDP they can be used to cover is low enough not to risk a default.  Additional debt will come at a higher price than the same debt now once that thing'd be in place, the market will see to that. What Europe needs to get off off is accumulating debt and by now, *every* state has got the message that it'd better repay. Berlusconi not getting it doesn't mean Italy doesn't grok it. Germans will start to have higher wages (yay!) not to suck the other states dry (yes, we've been utter bastards by dumping wages -- even with union participation). Trust me, the unions are working on reversing that; not everything is state politics; and even if the SPD isn't in power the social democrats still are in power.

A two-speed Euro is an even more unviable option than bonds, because it's going against *everything* the EU is actually trying to achieve... not to mention that the politics required to decide who is in which camp are way more intractable than laying down sufficiently common fiscal politics, that is, the EU fiscal ""government"" option. Which, in any case, is in every way preferable to having the IMF have a say.

Slightly off-topic, but relying on growth is pure hubris. Ever had a look at an exponential curve?

Gleichgewichtskuchen. It has the easiest recipe ever, you just need 300g eggs (about 5), 300g sugar, 300g flour, 300g butter, a bit of rum, 15g Backpulver, 15g vanilla sugar. 50min, 200°C.

Hermann. It's probably pretty similar to the Amish Friendship Cake. You get a bit of dough from a friend, add more stuff, feed the dough, give bits of it to your friends, feed it more and more and more and after about ten days you can bake the Kuchen, although some people make Brot out of the dough. It depends on how much sugar etc you add.

That depends on the percentage of GDP the bonds would cover. I certainly very much doubt it'd be more than 70%, probably less. It's about wiggle room, not a carte blanche to accumulate debt on the community's shoulders.

More importantly, though, it gets national interest in their own banks more or less out of the way, like France coercing Germany into saving Greece just to save French banks. The risk could be shared in an actually controlled, and thus way less risky, way.

A ""Europe of two speeds"" is in some way needed, yes, but not in the north growing more than the south... but in the south growing more than the north to alleviate the imbalance.

Think about how many years it took your countries to get where they are now and how much help from the outside it took.

In my opinion, its weak point is the development of creativity.

The best advice I can give you in terms of preparation is to read books in French, especially books you're already familiar with in English. Watch as many French films you can WITHOUT subtitles to get used to translating things on the spot. If possible, find someone to just have general conversations with in French. Not just the things you're taught in French class, but deeper conversations about opinions, values, etc... It's not easy but the sooner you start practicing these things, the better.

Once you're there, be prepared for ridiculously long school days in comparison to what you have now, usually 8am - 5:30pm. Your classmates may seem very aloof or even cold at first, but they should warm up to you after time, and you'll realise this better as your confidence grows. Try to avoid speaking English unless you have to, and if you're stuck for a word or phrase, try to find a way of explaining or saying it another way in their own language. They'll appreciate that.

Every teacher has different expectations of exchange students. I know people who have gone on exchanges and just read books throughout all their classes, I know others who attempted every single assignment. I'd recommend making a good effort without stressing yourself out too badly. I you can contribute, do, teachers will appreciate that. But above all, be respectful of them and their subject. (Same goes with respecting host family and their rules.)
You probably won't have classes like art, music, drama, etc. There are three streams, L, S and ES (literature, science and economics &amp; societal studies respectively). Your subjects will depend on which stream you're placed in, so if you get the opportunity to choose, figure out which one might be your cup of tea.

Finally, don't be too hard on yourself while there. Accept the fact that learning a new language and adjusting to a foreign culture is a gradual process and enjoy it! You may even find upon returning home that you'll miss some of the cultural differences. Bon chance :)

Agreed, yet it's so easily fixable with the help of today's technology as was demonstrated by Romanian education department this year:

&gt; Corruption in Romanian schools is not covered by the commission's monitoring scheme. But it provides a nice illustration of the difficulties of cleaning things up. Two weeks ago, the results of the Romanian school-leaving baccalaureate exam were released. They did not make for pretty reading. Following an anti-cheating initiative that saw CCTV cameras installed in schools, pass rates plummeted. Over half the students taking the exam failed; just two years ago, the pass rate was over 80%. In some schools, not a single student passed. [source](http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2011/07/corruption-romania?page=1)

The result is worrying but the method employed is applaud worthy. Cloud storage is cheap. Have government, medical and law enforcement workers carry a recording device at all times when on duty, and you'll slash corruption by 50% over-night. With an EU ran Anti-corruption department, in a couple of years corruption will be a non-issue.

As for what another comment pointed out, I'm sure there will be people who will gladly work for the 300€/month now, if they see a glimmer of hope in the way their country is heading in the future. This isn't happening right now, thus the mass emigration, and everyone in a position to accept bribes is leeching away every time they possibly can. Until there isn't anything left to leech that is.

Le Relais de la Poste on the Rue du Cherche-Midi in Montparnasse.  You'll recognize it by the blue awning.  It's owned by Gérard Dépardieu, and I actually met him once, though I didn't realize it at the time. (I worked for a dance school on the same street, and my boss joked that he was trying to buy up the entire neighborhood and soon would coming knocking on their door).  Everything is super cheap--you can get a café and tartine for 3 euro and a sandwich for less than 7 euro, if my memory serves.  I'm kind of sentimentally attached to this place because I was a regular and became very close with the patron, who is a wonderful man by the name of Philippe.  He's hugely friendly and is especially interested in Anglophones, having lived in England for a few years.

Le Stop Cluny is right by the Cluny-La Sorbonne metro/RER stop, and you can get a glass of wine and a jambon cru/saucisson/rillettes sandwich for 6 euro. The crepe stand right next to it is one of the cheapest I've found in the city, and good.  I ate there a lot, and loved sitting at the tables outside and watching the passers-by.

My boyfriend and I's favorite place to go when we were together in Paris was the Délice House on the Rue St. Antoine (it's one of hundreds of little Asian delis, but you can recognize it by the sign that says ""pho"" and has a picture of soup).  Best pho I have ever had in my life, no question, and it's only 7.50 euro.
