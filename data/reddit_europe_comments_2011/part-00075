Compared to elsewhere on the Continent, yes, immigrants in Britain have been interwoven into the social fabric quite successfully.  You only need to look at the influence that British Indians and Chinese have had on their cuisine to see this.  Britain has racism, for sure, but it's absolutely nothing compared to the French who routinely round up Roma gypsies and deport them en masse, the shunting of immigrants into ghettoes on the outskirts of Paris, or the Italians who refuse to buy coffee from a cafe that is owned by Chinese immigrants, forcing them to virtually hide the fact that it's owned by anybody other than an Italian.  Walking around the town where I live, you'd be hard pressed to understand that most of the cafes are indeed owned by Chinese immigrants.

Let's not even get on to football hooliganism, the Ultras, and their connection with racism in Italy and Spain, something that was stamped out, for the most part, in Britain decades ago, yet still lingers in these two countries.  Bananas on the pitch, anyone?

&gt; Berlusconi's coalition is not more nationalistic than mainstream British parties, it did include some fringe nationalist elements, but so does the Tory party. They were irrelevent in terms of actual governance.

Apologist nonsense.  The ruling coalition of Italy has included ""fringe"" Fascist elements for the last few decades (if they were that ""fringe"", why did they need to be included in the coalition to make up numbers?), yet somehow this pales into comparison with the imaginary Brownshirts marching up and down British streets.

&gt; I fail to see what's so interesting or special about some people in France liking DeGaulle and how it represents some sort of nationalism that's greater than the UK's.

De Gaulle's whole political philosophy was based around French prestige and nationalism.  If you don't understand how his hagiography in France implies something about French nationalist sentiment, then you really need to go and do some studying.

&gt; We're the nation of the BNP and UKIP, where anti-european sentiments are mainstream on the right, the unionists of NI, and so on.

The BNP have a couple of council seats at the most, with a few European MEPs.  In other words, a political irrelevance that means nothing on the national stage.  Compare and contrast this to governments on the continent that routinely have fascists in national government.

It rational within the framework of people actually having territorial and tribal instincts, because it is the least bad version of it. The instinct is there, and when it is not transformed to something useful such ways, it breaks out in lot uglier forms like racism. Also, the average person finds it very hard to care about a person if that person is not somehow ""one of us"".

It's a highly profitable situation for any bank, particularly the big ones! The ones that aren't allowed to fail and will get as many bailouts as possible. 

It's a perversion being indulged by corrupt officials of the EU. Banksters rule the planet. They sit on the boards of banks and in governing bodies. No one dares call out this conflict of interest.

If by ""somewhat"" you mean completely and utterly on the majority of issues then I agree.

Bolsting market confidence in an idiotic idea is not a wise idea for us. A monetary union without a fiscal union is idiocy. Why not try walking on water? Also, going in to the Euro would cause a lot of economic harm to the UK due to the differences in economic behaviours.

If the UK had an interest rate of 2% we'd see the property market collapse and no doubt have a very bad recession. Or, the ECB would have to start hoovering up UK debt which would not help market confidence at all. 

The EU is a threat because it is run by bureacrats and politicians who seem to believe in fairy dust. The problems in Greece were ignored when times were good because they could be and it was ""politically difficult"", France and Germany destroyed the stability and growth pact when it suited themselves.

EDIT: Following on from the last point, what exactly is in it for the UK? The last 2 decades has shown us that we have to fight very hard with our European colleagues to get anything. The CAP is still in force to keep the French happy despite the UK mostly giving up its rebate. 

The Germans may have be willing to foot the bill to absolve themselves of the guilt of WW2 but those feelings are obviously and quite understandably coming to an end. But I see no reason why the UK should fund things which work against our interests - see the proposed Tobin tax, CAP etc.

It seems to me that it's no coincidence that the strongest pro-Europe voices in this subreddit are Northern Europeans, especially Germans, who are raking in vast amounts of money, increasing their share of power in Europe, forcing arms onto Southern European countries that can ill-afford such extravagances, and generally feathering their own nests off the backs of Southern European widows and working men, and who have largely been immune to the crisis so far.  In short, this crisis has been extremely profitable for the likes of Germany, not just in terms of money, reduced bond yields, and so forth, but in terms of becoming the *de facto* leader of the Eurozone, almost sidelining Sarkozy completely, and several German posters here are clearly enthusiastic that their gravy train continue.

With fellow Northern Europeans starting to suffer the same sorts of economic pressures, will the *gung ho* attitude present in many Northern Europeans here abate somewhat?  Will Germany finally relent with its obstructionism and allow the ECB to find a way to act as lender of last resort?

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"There is much simpler way to do it. European Union creates a private bank dedicated to supporting financial stability of European states, it loans money from the ECB and invests it to bonds and other financial assets that it sees necessary to help the European economy. In short, the EU would create a European bad bank backed up the ECB.

However I don't think that the question is how to do it, it is much more about should monetizing/quantitative easing be used, and if yes, then in what scale and with what conditions. The fear is that if troubled countries are helped too much, they don't do needed structural reforms and will hinder future growth and sooner or later they will again have a financial crisis. Then again, it seems clear that Eurozone can't afford on not doing anything.

I myself would vote for the European Union to have a bad bank backed up by ECB and assisted by some kind of consultative arm for troubled countries that can go and sort problems out.

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"Why is it a bad thing for Germany to exercise its power? It has been one of the world's largest economies for decades, but has been sidelined by the existing intentional power paradigm into a regional power as if they still represent a threat to the status quo. They are the largest member state of the EU and the Eurozone, are increasingly the safest bet for bond investors, due to fiscal discipline and an efficient political system and political culture. You may not like the fact that Germany has the power that it does, but this is merely a natural outgrowth of confederacy, which the EU effectively is. The big states will exercise more power than the smaller ones. In the United States, California is by far the largest state, but it does not dominate politically or economically at any level because the United States is a federation. For over 200 years, states have been surrendering powers to the federal government to the point where the federal government supersedes state powers in almost all aspects of society. Angela Merkel has been pushing for more integration, and ultimately more federalization, despite opposition from within her own party, the CSU, and their coalition partner the FDP. Federal Europe will give Germany a worse position of power than it has now. It is both in and not in Germany's self-interest to encourage more integration. By faciliating integration, Germany lessens the risk of economic catastrophe for the entire continent, and ultimately the world, while simultaneously decreasing its relative power in the Union. I agree that a lot of what has been happening in regards to the troubled economies, specfically austerity packages, appears to be forced upon them by the sounder Eurozone members, but again, this is how confederacy works. Federalization would decrease the power of the big states and increase the power of the smaller states so that they more accurately reflect population demographics. The call for more integration is a vindication of the need to ditch petty nationalist tendencies to create a stronger, more prosperous Europe for all Europeans.

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"The majority of posters in this subreddit are Europhiles, and as such, are more pro-European than the general European populace. The UK has been the most significant brake on European integration for many decades because it has a unique role in international affairs that no other European nation has (the only other comparable country is France). As it stands now, the UK has the most to lose of any nation were it to embrace the European project wholeheartedly. It is one of America's closest and strongest allies. It has, after the United States, the most powerful naval and air power in the world. It still has the ear of much of its former empire, and London is along with New York, the most important and powerful city in the global economy. All of this helps contribute to a national identity that is often stronger than its equivalent in continental Western Europe. Not to mention that it is really the only country in the EU whose major centre-right party is Euroskeptic (increasingly so at that).

As I said before, Germany is pushing a political and economic platform that is both in and against its own interests. This is really no different from any other country in the EU. David Cameron and George Osbourne have stated on numerous occasions that the Eurozone needs to become a fiscal union, as it is the only surefire solution to the current crisis. This is in the UK's interests as it would protect the European economy from collapsing. This is against the UK's interests because it consolidates the EU's powers regardless of the UK's position on Europe. Europe is integrating with or without the UK. The longer the UK waits to jump aboard, the less influence it will have over the formation of a new Union, and will instead likely start to resemble a client-state to not only the United States, but to the European Union as well.

There are many reasons why the UK should not embrace European integration, however, most of these reasons stem from nationalist arguments. One of the main ideas behind the EU is a rejection of nationalism in exchange for pan-European diplomacy, cooperation, and friendship. The German government is concerned with how the debt crisis could affect them, this is true, though not any more so than any other state in the EU. Of all the national economies in the EU, Germany would likely be the least affected by the crisis, as it is the world's second largest exporter (and constitutes nearly 2/3 of the entire EU's total exports), and China is poised to overtake France as its largest trade partner. That being said, the current government is pushing an platform of more integration, that would subjugate all Eurozone members to a more federalized EU. The opposition advocates going even further, such as introducing Eurobonds backed by the entire Eurozone, which would entail Germany shouldering the largest portion of debt that wasn't theirs to begin with. Regarding Germany as a state that is acting purely out of its own self interest does injustice to reality. Yes, a lot of what Berlin is doing is for the betterment of Germany, but to deny that they are willing to surrender a lot of national sovereignty to help cover the rest of Europe's ass when the UK isn't, is ludicrous.",0,1321562478,null,0,false,0,c30mazx,t3_mflr4,t1_c30mazx,t1_c30m1p8,1427892119,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Furthermore what goes to Nordic countries, the nominal GDP of Finland is bigger than that of Portugal, a country with twice the population. And if you put all Nordic countries together, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland, the combined nominal GDP is the same as of Spain, a country with twice the population of the combined Nordic countries.

And in case of low immigration, tell that to Swedes. In case of Finland, yes, we have relatively low immigration, but that is up to individual countries on what they do with immigrants. If you have a problem of having illegal immigrants, you have to ship them back on where they came from, simple as that. Plus illegal immigrants have less reason to come here as hiring illegal personnel is too costly and risky for employers, and actually there is not much need for low skilled labor, for highly skilled and educated that is a different situation, but they usually get work permits easily.",0,1321563279,null,0,false,0,c30mg9q,t3_mflr4,t1_c30mg9q,t1_c30m251,1427892188,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"&gt;Literally every obstruction for finding a quick solution to the crisis has come from Germany. It's clear why.

Yes, it is, but not for the reasons you suggest.

It is mostly because Merkel understands that closer fiscal integration is required than her base of support, and the German electorate at large will stand for. It is not surprising that Euroskepticism is on the rise as a direct result of this crisis. There is no quick solution. The solution is fiscal union, which will require massive treaty changes, national referendums, and years of meticulous work. If the German electorate, and the European electorate at large, supported fiscal union, then Merkel would have been working on it for months now. The problem is that it is not a popular solution, especially in Germany, because many Germans don't think it is fair, nor their responsibility to pay for what they perceive as trouble the Greeks and Italians got themselves in to. The fundamental obstruction to a solution is the EU itself. It is a confederacy, and as such, national politics and games trump supranational issues such as the current crisis. If you want more evidence of this, look to what happened in Slovakia last month, in which the initial vote on expanding the EFSF failed, even though more than enough MPs agreed with the motion, because the opposition used it as a political tactic to force new elections. This is not a German conspiracy to take over the continent or profit at the expense of the countries it now calls friends.

true,khthon,PORT,Portugal. Exit. EU. NOW.,"I agree this is incidental. I keep saying that over the constant racism resurfacing over these issues, yet the discussion always centers that. But now there is an obvious interest in dragging along in the current state, which I doubt has not influenced the current German policies.

It just happens that the strongest economies are better placed to drain the IMF and ECB funds. And that's what is happening. German and French Banks and even most national banks that buy sovereign debt on the markets are becoming exceedingly rich from that and most probably trying to recover from the 2008 market collapse. Germany enjoys a 2% rate while Portugal 13%, Spain 6.4% and Italy 7.5%. This is the a national division can be made, between those with a different rates. Not language, not culture or borders.

As for Germany being the main contributor, I don't agree with. If anything, Germany profited from the EU, the EURO and now its banks are profiting from this zombie state. Keep in mind the German Reunification, those violent successive deficits, and of course, the WW2 legacy which will never go away. Perhaps they use that same argument of yours to rationalize the current exploitation. Either way, it would have happened eventually. This was expected and is now a question of maximizing profits before it all hits the wall.

The only way is to drastically reshape the EU, put a leash on the markets. Kill the offshore business. Suspend derivatives trading if needed and audit the big funds that are leveraging for any country's default. Put an end to all conflicts of interest in governing bodies and there are a lot of them.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; Germany enjoys a 2% rate while Portugal 13%, Spain 6.4% and Italy 7.5%.

Portugal pays about 3.5%, that's what the bailout was for. Those 13% are what Portugese bonds go for on the open market, which currently is not the source of Portugese funding, but merely where previously issued Portugese bonds are being traded between those who already have some but want to get them off their books and those who are willing to take the risk for a price that equates a 13% interest rate on what they pay.

As for Germany profiting, it's true that the ""safe haven"" status means lower interest rates, and that German capital comes back home along with foreign capital moving to greener pastures, but Germany would profit *much* more if the other economies were doing better, would buy German exports, and companies would more confidently invest into future growth.

true,khthon,PORT,Portugal. Exit. EU. NOW.,"Yes, there is a lose lose situation. For the German citizens. And in that order they'll begin falling. First falls the consumer, then the industry and eventually the banking industry in a certain order. 

What is going on is that the German growth is grinding down. As bailout contributions to the ECB and IMF are discussed, austerity follows. The industry suffers, tries to restructure itself, as does the government. Unemployment then rises. Consumption decreases. Credit gets cut from once thriving industries. Banks become at a risk. Whats the best method to compensate? Well, the same they employed to recover from the 2008 disaster. They squeeze interest rates from other ""ailing"" countries. Soon enough, Belgium, France, Austria and the Netherlands will see their rates increase. Banks scoop that on the free market. As long as interest rates remain way above what they get the money from. For a while it allows them to breathe. 

If you ask me, there is no long term sustainability or logic to this. It is all going to end badly. Because of greed. Because of huge conflicts of interests. Because there are no mechanisms in place to prevent it. And only Europe can put a stop to this. 

As for Portugal, the interest is 3.5% but even at that rate it's virtually impossible to recover without tools of devaluation relinquished with the Euro adhesion. We can't regulate our market.

The rest of the EU ratified it without referendum, indeed IIRC the French and another nation tried to avoid a referendum because the treaty was very unpopular. 

A political elite ratifiying a treaty is not democratic, how many of the citizens were allowed to voice their concerns or even have any say in anything related to the matter? 

Actually upon reading of [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon)

&gt; In 2005, referendums held in the Netherlands and France rejected the European Constitution

Yet the follow up to it, the Treaty of Lisbon was the European Consitution in all but name, the substance between the two was very little. Indeed [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_establishing_a_Constitution_for_Europe#Post-rejection) it states how the Eu went about doing so.

Probably never. So? You only ask again if you are unsatisfied with the answer, and that is perfectly normal discourse.

&gt; A political elite ratifiying a treaty is not democratic

I agree that the constitution could have been handled better. In France, the Netherlands and Ireland the pro-campaigns didn't do a good job, because, and I agree here, there was probably always the idea to rewrite it a little and circumvent the legal requirements for a referendum. When that was no longer possible after Ireland's rejection, the ones in favour started doing their job and Ireland passed it with quite a margin (2/3 thirds voted in favour, in fact).

So basically you're agreeing that the EU only wants to hear the ""correct"" answer with little regard for any alternative. This is the problem. A large number of people were unhappy with the Treaty of Lisbon but they were side-stepped and manipulated by the politicians so that their voices were not heard. 

These were not crackpots in some minority, but a sizeable majority of the populations of France, Ireland and the Netherlands - and probably the UK had we been given a vote.

How can we be critical of the likes of Russia and African despots fixing elections when we are doing the same in all but name. Maybe Putin was just asking ""are you sure?"" By any reasonable measure of democracy the implementation of Treaties across the EU are an embarassment.

&gt; In France, the Netherlands and Ireland the pro-campaigns didn't do a good job

So if the anti-campaigns  didn't do a good job should we hold the vote again? I'm guessing you'd rather they didn't. You see this as a good thing?

&gt; Nevertheless, representative democracy is still democratic.

My issue with this is that because of the sovereign nature of the countries involed in the EU the actual issue of the EU is generally lower down the list of concerns in a national election as other national issues tend to be higher up the list. 

And when the EU is brought in to the debate any who are considered anti-EU or merely just critical of the EU the politicans are considered to be ""out of touch"" as the EU is (wrongly) not seen to affect many peoples lives directly. Look how the Czech(?) President was treated when he made his anti-EU feelings known.

Also Jorg Haider's inclusion in to a coalition government in Austria caused that country to be [snubbed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rg_Haider#Coalition_government_with_Wolfgang_Sch.C3.BCssel.27s_People.27s_party). There is a freely elected party being snubbed by the EU because of its views. 

EDIT:  

&gt; and Ireland passed it with quite a margin (2/3 thirds voted in favour, in fact).

Is it not possible that those that voted No were pissed off at beingasked again and knew that their vote was worthless? I'd certainly feel that way and wouldn't bother voting again.

true,boq,BAVA,near Germany,"&gt; So basically you're agreeing that the EU only wants to hear the ""correct"" answer with little regard for any alternative.

No. The elected leaders of the member states agreed on the Lisbon treaty. They presented it to their national legislatures and it passed in 26 out of 27 of them. These nations decided that they wanted to go that way. Ireland's government also agreed to the treaty but didn't bother convincing its own people. It was absolutely reasonable for said 26 countries to ask the Irish a second time about the treaty because *they* decided to go that way and did not want to be impeded by Ireland's refusal. 

&gt; How can we be critical of the likes of Russia and African despots fixing elections when we are doing the same in all but name.

How can I take you seriously when you make such claims? Beatings, imprisonment, assassinations are not the same as asking a question a second time.

&gt; So if the anti-campaigns didn't do a good job should we hold the vote again? I'm guessing you'd rather they didn't. You see this as a good thing?

The anti-campaign is free to seek a new referendum. Unfortunately I don't know how that could be done, because I don't know enough about the Irish legal system. If they want something, *they* have to ask for it. It should be possible, though, the Lisbon treaty now includes an article about secession, so there are no fundamental legal hurdles to leaving any more.

&gt; sovereign nature of the countries

A little digression: Countries aren't sovereign any more. This entire concept, where the small despot didn't need to fear the big despot is so outdated. Our world is interconnected, our economies so intertwined. Sovereignty in the traditional sense is nothing more than an illusion. When one of the Europeans nations screws something up domestically, the entire continent feels it nowadays.

&gt; Also Jorg Haider's inclusion in to a coalition government in Austria caused that country to be snubbed. There is a freely elected party being snubbed by the EU because of its views. 

Yeah, a country will face consequences when it puts a man that was that close to Neonazism as Haider was into a position of power. There will be a response by its neighbours. The fact that its neighbours were also EU countries is secondary, the ""isolation"" was done by each country individually without the commission or anything.

&gt; Is it not possible that those that voted No were pissed off at beingasked again and knew that their vote was worthless? I'd certainly feel that way and wouldn't bother voting again.

Well, that's your opinion. Voter turnout increased by 5 percentage points, the result changed from 53 against/46 in favour to 67 in favour/33 against. I find it hard to believe that so many who were opposed stayed home and so many that couldn't be bothered to vote the first time suddenly got up and voted in favour.

There's even a big exhibit of these presepi in Piazza del Popolo just behind the Basilica di Santa Maria del Popolo. All of them are completely hand made and even if you're not a religious person it's a truly interesting and beautiful tradition, there are even very old pieces from 1500 or 1600 or the famous presepi from Naples, as many others from all over the world. 



There's a huge xmas market in Piazza Navona, ""il mercato della Befana"" this is the oldest roman Xmas tradition. Roman kids didn't have Santa to bring gifts, they had (and still have, but togheter with santa) [the Befana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befana), an old witch-like lady that fying on her broom brings sweets to good kids and coal to bad ones in the night between the 5th and the 6th of January. You'll see many befanas there!


Another Xmas market (less traditional and more touristy) is in Piazza Risorgimento (Vatican museums). 



There'll be a huge Xmas tree usually brought by the Black Forest in Germany and a nativity in St.Peter's square.



Antoher small Xmas market should be in front of St.John basilica (San Giovanni) 


Found a video with some of the places i mentioned above [here]

Roaming in the center there'll be [Zampognari](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdslmF1rTa0), aka traditional bagpipes (zampogne) players. They usually play Xmas tunes and just ask for some spare changes.

No, a political elite stitched up a deal after the failure of the referenda in France and the Netherlands. How many of those nations would have passed the treaty had it been put to the people? I suggest it would be a lot less that 26/27. 

&gt; These nations decided that they wanted to go that way.

No, a political elite decided that.

&gt; How can I take you seriously when you make such claims? Beatings, imprisonment, assassinations are not the same as asking a question a second time.

It is coercion nontheless, yes it is an exageration but it is not without some similarity. Were the Greeks intimidated out of holding a referendum by threats? I think you can make a reasonable case for saying that.

How would Germany behave if one state voted to do something differently from the others? Would it be bullied in to asking the question again? Or would some compromise be found? 

These are not trivial questions to be dismissed because should the EU integrate further I'm sure the Irish would like to have some confidence that their voice will be heard.

&gt; The anti-campaign is free to seek a new referendum. Unfortunately I don't know how that could be done, because I don't know enough about the Irish legal system.

The politicians in the UK have backed down time and again from having a referendum. There is no way in the UK that we can force one except outright rebellion maybe, I don't know about other countries either unfortunately but it is not trivial to hold referenda. 

&gt; Our world is interconnected, our economies so intertwined. Sovereignty in the traditional sense is nothing more than an illusion. When one of the Europeans nations screws something up domestically, the entire continent feels it nowadays.

So if Bosnia fucks up the whole of Europe grinds to a halt? No, it does not. Yes the globe is a lot more interconnected and we all have a collective interest in making things better but states are still sovereign. 

&gt; Yeah, a country will face consequences when it puts a man that was that close to Neonazism as Haider was into a position of power.

So you happily and readily accept a power (the EU) which denies the will of the people? Like it or not he was democratically elected. Where do you draw the line? Should we ban Islamic parties? Or maybe we should ban Communists and other groups. Fuck it, lets just have One Party.

Whether you like it or not, European nations have elected parliaments and directly or indirectly elected heads of state and/or government. They decide the course of their nations and are responsible to their voters. Referring to them as ""a political elite"" is nothing more than name calling. As we can see today in this crisis, the bulk of the authority remained with the nation states: they, that is, the big ones, are calling the shots, not the commission, not the parliament. Proper communitisation would have been different, but no, we just needed to cater to the nationalists. Well, here we are.

&gt; It is coercion nontheless, yes it is an exageration but it is not without some similarity. Were the Greeks intimidated out of holding a referendum by threats? I think you can make a reasonable case for saying that.

No, you can't. The Greeks can't expect free money without giving anything in return, in this case: austerity. It's perfectly reasonable for the lenders to halt payments until the other side meets your wishes. The Greeks themselves then scrapped the plans for a referendum. It's beyond me how you manage to turn everything around against the EU. It doesn't even have any of the powers necessary to be such a bully.

&gt; How would Germany behave if one state voted to do something differently from the others? Would it be bullied in to asking the question again? Or would some compromise be found? 

Germany is a federal republic with a completely different balance of power than the loose European Union. That question will yield no useful answer.

&gt; The politicians in the UK have backed down time and again from having a referendum. There is no way in the UK that we can force one except outright rebellion maybe, I don't know about other countries either unfortunately but it is not trivial to hold referenda. 

Seems like a national issue to me.

&gt; So if Bosnia fucks up the whole of Europe grinds to a halt? No, it does not. Yes the globe is a lot more interconnected and we all have a collective interest in making things better but states are still sovereign. 

Yes, I was talking about Bosnia, wasn't I. What an important country. You totally debunked me there.

&gt; Seriously? Bullshit. The EU knew it had no power but it acted ""independently"" in a very co-ordinated manner. 

""EU"", who is that supposed to be in that context? The commission? The parliament? The council? The other 14 EU members decided to not tolerate Austria's decision. Let's assume there was some kind of coordinated EU action (whatever that means): Would you have been more ok with it if it had been an informal telephone conference between 14 heads of state/government deciding on sanctions against Austria, completely without formal unions?

It's not that simple. Of course it's easy to translate the words, but what you're looking for is something that conveys the underlying message as accurately as possible. Put differently, you want to convey an attitude, and the words are merely a vessel to express it.

""No sympathy"" is a fixed expression. If you give us more context, we can probably come up with a fixed or idiomatic expression that more accurately expresses what you want to get across. ""Kein Verständnis"" or ""kein Mitgefühl"" both are translations of ""no sympathy"", but it's not something a native speaker would actually say in a situation where an English native speaker would say ""no sympathy"".

Also, the numbers on the chart on the left don't add up to anywhere near the total foreign debt figure. Add up the Ireland figures and it comes to 0.5 tn, compared to a figure on the right of 1.7 tn, for Britain 2 tn against 7 tn.

This is debatable, as it depends on how you define ""work."" It functions, that's true, but it's not efficient, democratic, and is the fundamental cause of the current crisis.

&gt;It's the single countries that don't work.

This is where is gets cloudy. Yes, there are certain countries with less efficient, less transparent, and more corrupt political systems than others, but because the EU is essentially a confederacy, national issues often trump supranational issues. Look at Slovakia during the passing of the EFSF's expanded powers. The opposition used a pan-European issue to force new elections in their own country. This is the kind of thing that happens all the time in weak federations (the early United States) and confederacies. Many of the EU's laws and requirements are also not strictly enforced because the EU lacks a lot of power. Maastricht required no country in the Eurozone to have debt exceeding 60% of GDP nor budget deficits exceeding 3% of GDP. Greece and Italy did not meet the first requirement, but were let in.

They hold on to the freedom of movement of workers/products/services etc. So there won't be a loss in terms of taking part in the EU economy.

I hardly think that most Europhiles are so because of the prospect of the EU being a counterweight to the US. The EU and the US maintain very close ties, and the US will likely start to strengthen those ties as China begins to eclipse its own economic and military power. The days are gone when the US could afford to ignore Europe. The world's power is increasingly centered around three large blocs, the US, EU and China. The differences between the two Western ones are far fewer than their differences with China. Yes, the United States has acted with arrogance and unwisely on occasion, but the EU and China represent a new paradigm of the international power structure. The UK is far too small to compete or interact with these three blocs by itself. However, it has the potential to be one of the most influential EU member states. This is how Germany has redefined its role in the world. For decades after World War II, Germany has been deprived of a significant role in international affairs by the status quo. The EU has given it an opportunity to channel its focus into shaping the foundation and role of a new political entity with superpower potentiality. Personally, I want the UK to fully engage the European project because it would further demonstrate to the world the legitimacy of supranational entities composed of many different peoples, faiths, histories, languages, and cultures.

Yet, when Britain says, essentially the same, we're in the EU but we've gone as far as we can go, everyone throws a fit. How dare we the British not automatically throw their lot in with this grand european project?

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"&gt;Europe will definitely get there though but I don't think they can do it without great britain.

I disagree that they can't do it without the UK. Were the UK to secede, the EU would still have an economy roughly equal to the US in terms of GDP, and have a population of about 450 million people. Continental Europe is large enough to effectively dwarf British policy and interests, somewhat similarly to the relationship between the US and Canada. Canada is not a major global power in the way the US is, and it is hard to imagine the UK remaining a global power when it is so much smaller than the US, EU, and China.

&gt; And it's a much longer timeline until it's a superpower in it's own right.

It depends on your definition of superpower. The US is still widely regarded as the world's sole superpower, but the EU already has the world's largest economy and soft power roughly equal to America's. China's military and economic might are rapidly increasing, and are beginning to push back America's influence in the Asia-Pacific region. The United States is no longer the economic and political model for the world. Nearly all democracies in the world have some form of parliamentary system, which is widely different from the American political system, which in recent years has been dishearteningly publicly displaying its most fundamental flaws. China, Russia and the EU all have different economic models from the US as well. China and Russia have forms of state-capitalism, and the EU is composed of many countries that have a social economy. The only facet in which the United States can still be considered globally dominant is militarily, though China's rise is putting an end to the nearly century long era of American military dominance. Finally, because of globalization, America's foreign influence has decreased drastically. Look at how little the United States matters to the European leaders dealing with the Euro crisis. America's influence over China fell off a cliff after 1948, but China was such a poor country until recently that they could afford to ignore it. I think that the world is exiting the era of the superpower, and is instead returning to the paradigm of great powers, similar to Europe from roughly 1500-1945. If there is anything that can be drawn from the fundamental historical interaction between great powers, it is of conflict. I hope that mutual economic interests and the advent of nuclear weapons are enough of a deterrent for war between the new great powers.

&gt;It's selfish but the wait and see approach has no downside for them at the moment. 

It's hardly selfish for the UK to be more resigned from the European project than other countries. They joined the EEC in 1973, and the past 28 years, that organization has transformed into something entirely different: one now on the brink of statehood.

I think this is symptomatic of this conflation of xenophobia and politics. Britain wants to be part of Europe, but part of a Europe which refuses to spend 60% of its budget on agricultural subsidies, that doesn't introduce futile and bizarre legislation like cucumber grading, that doesn't create a tragedy of the commons in European fisheries, and then encourage it by mandating the dumping of fish. That is not xenophobia, and certainly not racism, but legitimate concern about the competence and political orientation of the central European government. The British are not willing to give the European authorities a free pass because of political idealism, and have a vision of a less centralized, but more widespread European alliance.

Firstly on the soft power.  I think that Of the US/China/EU, the EU has the least soft power by far.  Mainly because the last half centuries policy of inward looking and Germany's restricted role in world affairs.  Both the US and China have developed a lot more soft power.  The US's soft power extends to Europe herself, a characteristic that does not flow both ways.  Switzerland, though not a member of the EU and the banking relations with the US and subsequent settlements shows the soft power there.  Participation in the Iraq war by European nations is also, in my opinion of soft power in Europe, because it is a tacit support of US hegemony to participate rather than coercion that brought it on.  Also the fact that US sponsored laws are pushed through many European parliaments (like IP laws, missile defense stuff etc) fairly commonly shows the soft power imbalance.

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"&gt;Firstly on the soft power. I think that Of the US/China/EU, the EU has the least soft power by far.

I don't dispute that American soft power is more significant than European soft power. I argue that European soft power exceeds that of China's. Parliamentary government itself is a European construction. Almost every democracy in the world is modeled in some way off a parliamentary system, usually the Westminster system. European models of government are the standard model for a democracy to take, not American, and certainly not Chinese. Most of China's soft power is a result of its economic strength, but it is still a much smaller economy than the EU or the US. Chinese cultural influence is far below that of Europe's and America's.

&gt;Participation in the Iraq war by European nations is also, in my opinion of soft power in Europe, because it is a tacit support of US hegemony to participate rather than coercion that brought it on. Also the fact that US sponsored laws are pushed through many European parliaments (like IP laws, missile defense stuff etc) fairly commonly shows the soft power imbalance.

The Iraq War began more than 8 years ago. Europe has changed **a lot** in those 8 years. The Lisbon Treaty was ratified in 2007, and many of its components still have yet to be implemented. The EU has evolved into a much more powerful entity than it was in 2003. A lot of European countries participated in the war, but every single one of them has withdrawn. The UK had the only significant number of troop deployment anyway. The Iraq War itself was a turning point for Europe. Europe has become less eager to follow America's lead. Hell, it was only a few months ago that Sarkozy and Cameron were trying to get Obama to take a more active role in Libya. The majority of  America's soft power that affects Europe is cultural (movies, TV, etc.), which is an entirely different story. I'm not arguing that the EU is a superpower, what I'm trying to say is that Europe has soft power roughly equal to America's. Its soft power is concentrated in other areas, like Eurasia, Africa and parts of the Middle East. The very fact that the American economy is now beholden to what happens in the Eurozone is evident of America's decreasing relative soft power.


&gt;I also take issue with the idea that parliamentary and US single member district style goverments are very different. This could be a very long and very dry argument so i'll sum it up by saying that they both have the same goals and end results, just a different in when and how coalitions are formed. Trivial differences though and much more similar than they are different in governance.

They really are very different. In a parliamentary system, the executive is an outgrowth of the legislature, and is not directly elected. In the US, the executive is an entirely separate entity that is (almost) directly elected. Parliamentary systems almost always are characterized by at least several political parties. The US has been dominated by a two party system reaching back to its inception. The judicial branch in many parliamentary systems don't have the power of judicial review, where as it is an explicit power for the American court system. The US holds elections to the lower House every two years, whereas parliamentary systems generally do not have set election years, and a government can fall for a number of reasons, forcing new elections. The Senate is very different from most upper houses in parliamentary systems because it has incredible power. These are anything but trivial differences. Government structure is one of the most fundamental aspects of countries. Even though two countries are democracies, they can still be wildly different.

&gt;Until the EU can act politically militarily and economically with one voice they don't have the ability to generate soft or hard power, because relationships with individual states are still more valuable to countries than dealing with the EU as a whole.

I disagree. Hard power need not be military power, and soft power already exists in great abundance. Economic power is a measure of hard power. The EU has used its economic power in a variety of ways. It has offered to essentially ""buy"" Belarus from its dictator. It has pledged to help rebuild Libya via investments. The very fact that the entire global economy is on the brink because of the Euro crisis shows just how influential the EU's economy is. The EU as a bloc is also increasingly becoming a power in international relations. It is part of the quartet in the Israel-Palestine issue, and on the developments of the Arab Spring, the EU has taken stances as a whole, in addition to the individual member states making joint statements. The world we now live in is one that is less about hard power and more about cooperation and soft power. The United States might be the most powerful country militarily, but nuclear weaponry essentially levels the playing field between nations. If we assume that the US, the EU, and China are rational actors (which they are), we can assume that they will not go to war with one another not only because of their economic interdependence, but because a war between any of them would be too costly to every side. Military power is instead resigned to proxy wars, intimidation, and non-nuclear powers. It is not a good means of comparing superpowers or the new great powers.

&gt;We mainly disagree on how long this will take. I am under the impression that it will take at least 50 years to get to the level of integration necessary to be considered a unified power..

This is true. I think that a 50-year window is reasonable, but it's probably not wise to bet on it. A year ago, most people didn't think the EU was terribly close to fiscal union. Today, because of the Euro crisis, fiscal union has become the only solution to the crisis, and is being advocated by many European leaders, such as the German Chancellor herself. The EU could consolidate its power quickly or slowly. Many, myself included, think that it is already at the point where it makes sense to have a G3 (EU, US, China), as in a few years, they will create a huge portion of the global economy.",0,1321675255,null,0,false,0,c310862,t3_mgwxi,t1_c310862,t1_c30zz3c,1427898797,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

A sales person makes 6 € an hour, but recently they are taking on unpaid interns to fill sales positions with unpaid interns and holding out the carrot that they will hire them if they are good workers. In reality the store has no intention of hiring them unless they can replace the paid workers at a lower rate. They are just using the interns to fill temporary positions during the Christmas season and will most likely dismiss them in January. The boss at the store also wants to pay a portion of the paid worker's wages under the table.

Our situation is a bit unique in that we just moved back to Germany after a 19 year absence. My wife took the job while she looked for other work so that we qualified for health insurance. If we had to live on this wage we would be in trouble. It wouldn't begin to cover expenses. Sales jobs in Berlin are low paid.

When British bond prices start shooting up the UK will have to print more causing much larger inflation than what they are facing now and this will kick the shit out of the British public's purchasing power. The UK already has a bad case of stagflation and that's without the worlds media kicking up a market frenzy so christ only knows what will happen if/when they start getting the attention that the PIIGS have been getting.

This is ridiculous. The implication is that unless we think exactly as those who run the EU think we are ""anti-European"". There are many ways to be pro-Europe without wanting an enormous semi-democratic superstate economically dominated by the Germans. 

Our objections to the EU have been consistent across the years. The British object to:

* The CAP, which is effectively a subsidy for French farmers.

* The EU fisheries policy, which has destroyed our fishing industry and our fish stocks, and is cited by Icelanders as *one of the main reasons* they do not want to join the EU; ""Look at what happened to the British"".

* Attempts to impose laws and taxes detrimental to our economy or way of life. Recently, the Germans have been talking about introducing a tax on financial exchanges; 80% of that tax would be paid by the British out of transactions going through the City of London. It is basically a tax on the British to bail the Germans out of the mess they've created with the Euro. We would have to idiots to agree to it.

Le problème, c'est que si on achète un disque, on nous interdit d'en faire un mp3 pour le mettre sur notre baladeur, d'utiliser l'outil informatique comme il doit l'être. Nous avons affaire ici à des moines copistes, qui voudrait bruler la presse de Gutenberg.

Oui, un fichier peut être copié à l'infini sans perte, c'est même le principal intérêt du numérique.

Oui, le fichier peut être échangé, c'est aussi une des grandes qualités de l'informatique.

Oui, je continuerais à dire à mes amis ""si tu veux, je te prête ceci, j'ai vraiment passé un bon moment"" et je veux que cette personne puisse jouir d'un objet entier et identique à ce que j'ai eu entre les mains. Si cela m'est interdit, je ferais TOUT pour le faire quand même.

Empêcher l'échange au nom de l'argent est une idée inique et qui ne peut être mise en place de par la nature même de l'humain et de ses rapports sociaux.

This is certainly how this subreddit has repeatedly painted us. The anti-British sentiment in here is sometimes breathtaking. Swedes and Swiss, and other Eurosceptic nations within the EU are never at fault for speaking their mind, but the British are always painted as ""holding the EU back"" when they speak theirs. 

I dispute the idea we are holding anything back because I do not believe the majority of Europeans even want an EU superstate, at least not in the form it is emerging - undemocratic, dominated by Germany, wasteful of resources and suffering from foolish mismanagement. If we held a Europe wide referendum on the subject *right now* I am betting the majority would be ""no"". It is a small elite born of the post war generation, and fearful of another war that are pushing this project ahead, seemingly against all objections. If we are the only people who can stop it, then stop it we will. That isn't selfish, it's the only reasonable course of action.

The British have historically been interested in stability in Europe. Having a massive, undemocratic superstate covering the continent, using its economic might to push everyone around and do its bidding (the Germans are trying this already) is not stability, and will not be good for anyone. Why on Earth would we let that happen when we could stop it?

&gt; It's just childish; I imagine in their eyes they are 'saving us from ourselves' but in our current state, the EU as an entity is weak on the global scale of politics.

Who the fuck cares? As long as we are strong, economically, as a block, who cares how the rest of the world perceives us? We have two nuclear armed states in the EU, and enough resources to see off any potential aggressor. Beyond that, why would you care if the US or China or anyone else see's us as a non-entity.  

I would like to finish by saying that having a *different* vision of Europe does *not* make you anti-European. Nor does it make you a xenophobe, anti-EU, or ""difficult"".

It is my belief that the run to UK bonds is a reaction to the Eurozone inaction on the debt crisis as opposed to any real belief in the UK economy. Selling debt is all about confidence, the UK can be risky, you just have to be less risky than others and right now they are considerably less risky than others. The real problems for the UK come once the Eurozone gets it act together then the UK will need to be in relativity good shape as all it will take is one downgrade to get the ball rolling on a UK's bond rise.

You seem to have higher confidence in the UK's economy than I, can you explain were you see a British recovery coming from. I honestly don't see how a UK recovery can occur at all under current circumstances:
 
* Ballooning deficit

* Ballooning state expenditure

- Strangulation of private enterprise through taxation and regulation

- Government policy led by short-term electoral considerations, rather than long-term strategic necessity

- Economic uncompetitiveness due to the cost burden of the welfare state.

* The ConDem administration has predicted that 600,000 public sector jobs will need to be shed before the next election, at around 120,000 per year.

true,Captain_Pwnage,null,null,"Germany is known for it's vast exports, which in turn further nurture Germany's national economics (e.g. exporting cars, arms, electronics, bio-chemicals, nuclear technology etc.).

But for every product exported there has to be someone willing to pay for it, for example: GREECE! In 2010 Germany exported goods worth 6 billion euros and imported goods worth 2 billion euros to and from Greece, netting a total of 4 billion Euros. (1)

Kicking Greece out of the monetary union would surely be a solution in short-terms, maybe a quite favorable one for Greece, which is already ratifying one spending-cut after the other.
But while international trade is possible without the monetary union in the EU, it certainly makes financial procedures go smoother, thus increasing wealth for the exporter, in this case Germany.

Also, bailing out Greece is not equal to paying Greece's debts. As a matter of fact, it is quite the opposite. Think of it this way: Greece is already indebted quite heavily, if noone bails them out now, those debts will probably default and be worthless. Quite a lot of banks and private investors will then net in heavy losses, resulting in a new financial crisis.
Instead, if Germany helps out here it will sustain it's financial relationship to Greece and receive the money spent back (hopefully) with interest.

So as a professional average German I'd advise to bail out Greece and possibly Italy.
