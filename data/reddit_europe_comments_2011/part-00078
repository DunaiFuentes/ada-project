Culturally, the US dominates. If I want non-US films I usually have to go to a ""foreign films"" section of a DVD store (this often includes British films). Bear in mind that US films tend to be morally simplistic (good guys vs bad guys) with clear analogies to current events. Similarly, non-US or UK music will generally be in a ""world music"" section (which in my local store has a total of 10 CDs, no joke). 

Newspapers and TV news will be filled with information of US elections, Hollywood, celebrities, etc. We know all about your political candidates, your major state stereotypes, diplomatic relations, the Super Bowl, shuttle launches, whatever, even if we don't care (in contrast, I found out nothing about major events in Europe - even Scotland or Ireland - unless they directly effect England, or more likely London).

Das ist doch kein Geheimnis, dass Deutsche ""ordnungsbewusster"" sind als andere Völker im Westen, oder? Besonders im Vergleich zu den Nachbarn-Eurostaaten und den USA.

Das heißt aber auch nicht gleich was Schlechtes, versteh mich nicht falsch. Manchmal ist es verdammt ärgerlich, mit Korinthenkackerei und der Unfähigkeit, außerhalb des Rahmens zu denken, konfrontiert zu werden, wenn man zum Beispiel mit irgendeinem Beamten zu tun hat. Da gibt es eben keine graue Zone, halt schwarz-weiß Recht und Ordnung. 

Aber auf der anderen Seite gewährleistet dieses allgemeine Spießertum eine Öffentlichkeit, in der Bürger und Touristen besser beschützt bzw. weniger abgezockt werden. Eichbeamten sind hierfür ein gutes Beispiel, finde ich. Deutsche sind allgemein gesagt auch eher dazu bereit, jemanden, der die Öffentlichkeit stört, anzusprechen als Bürger aus anderen Ländern, die ich besucht habe. Das finde ich voll in Ordnung und wirklich lobenswert.

This has been put together by a council of experts of the german environmental department, the scenarios represented therein are the result of mathematical modelling under different energy consumption conditions.

The gist is that even in worst case scenarios and considering the effect of coal plants being built now and the (now obsolete) prolongation of nuclear plants' running time it is still possible to achieve 100% renewable energy in Germany by 2050, **IF** action is taken as soon as possible (within the year the report came out, the German version came out in January 2011). Among other things, the report offers economically viable solutions to the transition periods.


Page 71 of the PDF:
&gt;The scenarios presented here posit a possible future state of the German electricity supply system
based on a predefined level of electricity demand in the year 2050, and in so doing demonstrate
the following:
– that a wholly renewable electricity supply (a) is achievable in Germany on its own, or via an
inter-regional electricity supply network encompassing North African and neighbouring
European states, based on technical potential; and (b) would provide a fully reliable electricity
supply round the clock year round,
– the specific elements and their composition that such a system would comprise, assuming that
(a) the attendant costs were optimised by 2050; and (b) these costs evolve in a manner that
appears to be plausible based on today’s knowledge,
– the probable order of magnitude of the costs of such a system,
– how the makeup of the system components, as well as system costs, would vary according to
the design of the different scenarios.
These findings were then used to determine how the available electricity generation, transmission
and storage capacities would need to evolve in order to achieve the defined target state by 2050.
Based on the characteristics of the existing power plant fleet, we show how conventional
generation capacity could be replaced incrementally by renewable energy

Jobbik is not a new (or emerging) party. And they lost support after the elections. The only reason they have more support than MSZP, is because MSZP has lost a lot of voters.

There is an important detail in Hungarian patriotism: every Hungarian with some nationalistic feelings has to be pro-Europe. There are a lot of Hungarians living in bordering countries, and the best way to have close ties across the borders, is to have all those countries be in the EU, and have no borders.

true,rsporter,null,null,"You might have better more responses in [r/berlin](http://www.reddit.com/r/berlin/)

I live in Berlin currently, though I am not a native Berliner (nor German for that matter), I have studied Berlin (history/architecture) at the graduate level so I feel I have a reasonable amount of input to provide.

I'd imagine that those living near the Führerbunker don't think about the fact very often. For the most part the area was ignored. I'm sure there was knowledge that it was the former site of the Chancellery, but being basically completely hidden from public knowledge throughout the GDR and only developed in the late 80s. Obviously you'd have to find someone who actually has lived there to know for sure.

As someone who lives in Berlin I don't ignore particular sights of the Nazi  regime, but I also don't seek them out on a regular basis, except when deliberately visiting them for historic reasons or whatever. There are many other sites of Nazi evil that can be visited such as the Topography of Terror, Sachsenhausen or Wannsee House that are more evocative because they have been deliberately made to be sites of learning/remembrance. I walked in the area of the chancellery, but have never sought the area out for that reason or stopped to read the more recently installed plaque.

Berlin is an amazing city because of its history. What I love about Berlin is the contrasts. Moreso than virtually any city I know, Berlin evokes the turbulent 20th century. Especially as a capital city of a major European nature it is unrivaled in the way that so much history can be understood from the built environment. The grand Wilhelmine facades, the interwar modernism, Nazi monumentalism, Soviet-inspired allees, Plattenbauten, mid-century modernism, rapidly built post-war housing, Altbau with destroyed facades, 80s Postmodernism, Potsdamer Platz. All of these things are a result of the history of Germany and Berlin for the past 150 years.

There are still scars of World War II and the Wall throughout Berlin. Bullet holes can still be found in prewar buildings. Huge swaths of land have yet to be developed where the wall stood. It's somewhat easy to visually notice when you've crossed into the east. As for the non-physical differences between east and west Berlin, I think they have *largely* disappeared. I'm sure that there are plenty of people who still have issues, but I (as a relative outsider) see no real representation of this in my daily life. You would find a more specific difference with elsewhere in former East Germany, rather than Berlin. Others, especially native Berliner might have a different view of this, but it's the impression I've gotten from virtually all of the expats I talk to.

I would argue that the history of place where you live does not have a huge influence on your day-to-day life and routine. Obviously the physical makeup of a city alters your life but I do not believe people are cognizant of this on a regular basis. I never stopped to think about the history of my hometown on a regular basis and I sincerely doubt that Berliners do either. People just live their lives. I would say that it takes a specific incident/idea/reference before someone really thinks about how the history influences their lives.

true,Athaba,null,null,"Ignorieren vs Bühne bieten. Ich habe Neo-Nazis immer als Leute gesehen, die gegen etwas rebellieren. Das sind doch oft Leute, die die Schuld, dass sie keine Ausbildung und keinen Job haben und dann von Leuten gesagt bekommen die Ausländer/Linken/Juden/... sind dran schuld. Die Sache mit deutscher Kultur und Identität sehe daran begründet, dass sie in oder nach einem chaotischen Leben Struktur suchen, was ja an und für sich nichts schlechtes ist und warum auch viele zum Militär gehen. Alles in allem ist ein Neo-Nazi für mich jemand mit total fehlgeleiteten Emotionen, was man ja auch an den daraus resultierenden Anschlägen merkt.

Ich denke das Schema ist bei allem was man als Terrorist bezeichnet das selbe. Da ist jemand ohne Perspektive und irgendeine Gruppe instrumentalisiert das.

Ich glaube nicht, dass man sich da fragen sollte, ob man ignorieren oder bekämpfen sollte, zumindest nicht so wie es jetzt ist indem man diese Leute noch weiter in derartige Szenen rein drängt und damit radikalisiert. Viel eher sollte man dafür sorgen dass, sie auch im normalen, nicht radikalisierten Umfeld einen Job und Anerkennung bekommen. Dann bemerken sie, dass die ""Feinde"" sehr häufig vor genau den selben Problemen stehen und generell nicht so übel sind.

Was Verbote betrifft wäre ich vorsichtig. Denn das kann, wie gesagt dazu führen, dass man noch weiter in diese Szene gedrängt wird. Außerdem ist es immer noch besser einen quasselnden Nazi zu haben, der eine Partei wählt und Sticker verteilt, als einen dem alles egal ist und Anschläge verübt. Den kann man im Auge behalten, häufig noch normalisieren, etc. Verkriecht er sich in einer Vereinigung und hört nur noch die wird es schwer.

Es gibt eine weitere Schwachstelle bei den Rechtsparteien. Sie leisten nichts. In ganz Europa feiern rechtspopulistische Gewinne und stürzen dann, ab weil sie unfähig sind. 

Es gibt auch Beispiele für Terrororganisationen, die entweder einen politischen Arm bekommen haben und damit aufgehört haben zu radikalen Mitteln zu greifen und Parteien, die verboten wurden und dann zu Terrororganisationen geworden sind. Genau hier liegt die Stärke der Demokratie. Man kann einen Diskurs aufbauen und aufzeigen, dass hinter derartigen Gruppierungen nichts steckt. Man darf nur nicht den Fehler begehen und glauben, dass die Anhänger oder Anführer dumm sind (sonst wären die Terroristen nicht so lang unentdeckt geblieben). Sie sind ""nur"" vollkommen verblendet. Vielen fehlt es auch schlicht und ergreifend an Geschichtsunterricht.

All diese Auswüchse kann und sollte man nachhaltig mit Aufklärung und anständiger Politik bekämpfen. Wichtig wäre in diesem Zusammenhang wohl eine gute Ausbildung, die auch dann möglich sein sollte, wenn ein Jugendlicher aus irgendeinem Grund (Armut, Gewalt in der Familie, ...) nicht die beste Leistung erzielen kann. Sonst produziert man genau solche Außenseiter ohne Perspektive, die dann zu Gewalt neigen, Drogen nehmen und/oder sich NPD anschließen.

Your friend is only half right. You can live and work anywhere in the EU, and you can't be discriminated against in job openings or when it gets to fees (e.g., tuition), but you don't have access to financial social programs like welfare or student aid. It's possible to get BAB as a non-national, but this has additional requirements (probably something like long-term residency, graduation through the German school system, or being married to a national). Obviously, this is to quiet the ""those foreigners just come here to take our benefits"" crowd which I'm sure you're all too familiar with.

Another issue is that a simply internship probably wouldn't qualify anyway.

Countries need to do a rollover of existing bonds as they expire to pay them, if the market forces them to do that with horrible interest rates you get into a vicious circle. The *bailouts* in Europe supposedly allow the countries some time with lower than market interest rates to fix their finances in a way that they can then become sustainable, I don't see what's so hard to understand. Basically it's like asking a low interest loan from your bank so you can pay the credit card which has a huge interest rate and later you pay the bank because your salary is enough to pay their monthly payments when, for the credit card, it wasn't.
  
Iceland is a very poor example as they effectively **stole** many Europeans by not giving them the same guarantees they gave to Icelanders and had committed themselves to also giving to foreign depositors. Iceland is, in my opinion, a rogue nation until they decide to pay what they owe to EU citizens.

Regarding the car thing, I think it is mostly because we Europeans like drinking more, therefore don't prefer to drive to restaurants and suchlike.

*checks flair - sees Portugal, all is explained* No deary, you cannot borrow your way out of debt.

&gt; The bailouts in Europe supposedly allow the country some time with lower than market interest rates to fix their finances in a way that they can then become sustainable, I don't see what's so hard to understand.

It's not hard to understand but then neither is the concept of a unicorn. Bailouts buy time they do not buy you anything else. Greece was insolvent from the start but that was ignored, they have struggled to pass the changes needed to cut the deficit etc but again Europe is living in a dream. Greece needs to default.

The problem with Greece defaulting is that insurance contracts (CDS) will kick in that will bring the EU banking system down. That's more of a problem than Greece. 

Europe is running out of time because it means a lot of hard and very unpopular political decisions will need to be taken. Not to mention the political unrest that will be the result of those decisions. 

The truly tragic thing in all this is that this was all very predictable many years ago when the Eurozone was formed and the Stability and Growth pact flouted by France and Germany.

QE is bad because it doesn't address the real issue. It doesn't solve the real problem. It only makes it look as if it has solved the problem. You're essentially solving your debt problem and your inability to service that debt and/or borrow more by ""ordering"" your central bank to buy debt from you. You are essentially only digging yourself even deeper into the hole you're already in.

Another problem is that the QE is seen as a method of last resort. The QE is already in effect in the US. Meaning, after the QE no longer works (and this day will come), what the hell are we going to do then?

Then there is a risk of a spiraling inflation involved. Inflation in the US is presently under control, but it is quickly approaching 4%, as opposed to the average of about 2% during the 1990s. 

Instead of initiating QE, the politicians need to focus on the root of the problem: the budget deficit, meaning lowering expenses and increasing taxes. QE just means postponing the inevitable, without actually fixing the problem.

true,dageshi,null,null,"If the worlds economy was functioning normally then I'd agree wholeheartedly with you, QE is a terrible policy and the dangers of inflation are real but my view is that under present circumstances there are equally large deflationary forces pushing against the economy, if the fed uses an inflationary policy to counteract that and the end result lies somewhere in the middle then it's probably a lot better than doing nothing at all.

And as will know that QE is subtly different to just printing money because those dollars will be sent back to the central bank when the bonds are repaid by the US government, they are created but they will be destroyed again in the future, likewise the fed has done plenty of QE and currently the inflation rate in the US is 3.53% which I would say is fairly benign by historical standards. The rate in the UK is higher but as well as QE we've also had a currency devaluation and a rise in VAT by 2.5% which all feeds through into the inflation figures.

I don't think QE is some panacea, I wish we didn't have to do it, but I don't realistically know what the alternatives are because europe seems to be following in the footsteps of the policy mistakes made in the great depression and this worries me greatly.

Yes, according to my experience, companies will let you out of the contract when leaving the country. However, there is one exception: resellers. Companies like Mobilcom/Debitel who resell contracts from providers like T-Mobile do not allow an early cancellation of the contract, since they are bound to the contracts of the providers they're reselling.

However, from my experience I would never recommend resellers like Mobilcom/Debitel anyway, they have an incredibly high rate of cases of people with high phone bills. Do NOT get a contract from them!

So whereas previously France or Britain would have stamped out minority languages, they moved to tolerance on their own, and now to encouragement under the EU. Whereas previously trade barriers and barriers to movement would have isolated the mass of the Dutch from the Germans, and the Germans from the Poles, under the Single Market and the Schengen agreement no such meaningful distinction exists. Also, where previously secessionist areas/provinces wouldn't have been able to survive on their own, the EU offers them the prospect of bypassing national governments and going straight to Brussels. So there is a process of dissolution which will occur, although you could legitimately question both the importance of national identities, and whether that process of dissolution is positive or negative. 

Also, at the moment there isn't much of a unified European culture to do the assimilating, apart from the techno/eurocrat group. I suppose an objection you could raise is that the people most comfortable in any new pan-European culture would be those who are bilingual, and therefore either born into bilingual families or well-educated, and the isolated and poorly-educated will be excluded.

Germany don't need to want to rule Europe. Their size and economy makes it pretty much certain that they do, even if they don't want to. EU or not, they are going to be roughly 50% of Europe. 
Look at the current criss. Everything circles around what Germany decides to do. They have to do it together with France, but after these two make the decision, others must follow.  



&gt;6\. Blaming the EU for austerity caused by reckless domestic policies is like blaming the Mountain Rescue Service for gravity.

Spain was not reckless. Greece caused it's own mess. Spain did not. Spain had it's fiscal policy in order before recession. Spain's problems were caused by cheap money that was flowing from Germany and France and causing property values and wages to get out of control. When that money stopped flowing, Spain had to take more debt. Italy had lots of debt even before the crisis, but it's growth was under control. 

Spain and Italy are in trouble because Euroarea is very unoptiomal currency area. Business cycles between countries don't' match.

true,andyjonesx,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Thanks for your reply. I am from Birmingham, so that is nice to know about the restorations. I understand there are some advantages of the EU, but do they outweigh the disadvantages?

It is good that we can go through the airports so fast at times, though at other times it can take ages still. In fact, when I went to a non-EU country I didn't notice the difference. The only thing I notice is that planes going cross-Europe are generally smaller so less people are waiting in the queue. And as a superficial point, I don't get a stamp :(. But regardless, can the countries not come to an agreement that you can subscribe to, outside the EU?

The legislations are hit and miss. Can these not be made outside the EU? I feel England are generally good with the law, so can't the country decide to put these things in place, without having to have EU do it for us? They also pass some laws that may benefit some part of Romania, but have no bearing in Britain. Again, surely you can just look at another countries law, think ""that sounds right"" and do the same?

As for the funding from the EU, that is good, but as a country with a good economy I think we still lose out. It costs the country £65 billion a year. Birmingham is the countries 2nd biggest city, so if £30 million was a big part (or for arguments sake, we can call it £200 million), it is still unlikely that the value we put in comes back. If we did get the same amount back then surely EU wouldn't be so favourable to the countries with a lot less money, since they would only break-even or lose money.

As for the negatives, I am not overly against immigration, but the EU means that a lot of people from foreign countries can openly come and work in the UK. While this is fine, it also leads to large areas inhabited by people from one country (makes sense to move to a place where more people like you live). Digbeth in Birmingham, for example, has a really high Polish population. This segregation (not forced, but for lack of a better word) doesn't help with people settling in, and can cause tension in these areas as they no longer appear English. The people also often work to send money back home, so the benefit to the economy sometimes doesn't actually happen.

For anyone reading the above as me being a UKIP or BNP (right wing parties) supporter (I'm very, very not), but the country itself puts limits to other immigration, so it isn't something that is overly favourable.

So for the cost of it, the only true benefit I have read it that it gives the UK some kind of international political power, and that is the bit I don't really understand.

But as I said, I am Euroskeptic, but I do understand that the newspapers often try and show the worst parts, and I have tried to educate myself in it.",0,1322506762,null,0,false,0,c33fmdb,t3_mrze1,t1_c33fmdb,t1_c33fgo1,1427941388,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

I thought a bit about this. Because I feel absolutely very European; I recognize the parts of Europe as varieties of the same plant, with a largely common history. But I feel Italian also. So I think it is not an either/or thing, in the same way as one feels part of a region (with its own traditions, etc) but also of a state. It's more a layered feeling.

2. Sweden hasn't ever been a protected economy, they have always been in the forefront of free trade as they have been an export driven economy. The key to success of Swedish society has been their high-tech/high-spec industries that have had the ability to export and grow. The same is true also in Finland, without free trade it would have been impossible for Nokia to extend into telecommunications and become a global corporation.

    I also don't understand why do you see having free trade and market economies as bad things? From my point of view free trade and market economy gives us the efficient production engine that enables us to produce and exchange value with other countries and people. After the value has been produced, it is up to the people to decide on how it should be divided and used, and this is what leftist should be concentrate on, not on the means of production.

    In case of Euro, it is a good thing that we can't devaluate our currency. In yesteryears when export industries and unions made big bad decisions from time to time that almost drove them into bankruptcy, to bail them out our currency had to be devalued causing a massive amount of wealth transferred from other industries and citizens to these failing ones. Now as we can't devalue our currency, all companies and unions have to really think on where to invest and what to demand. Not to mention that currencies of small countries were almost always under the constant threat of a speculative attack. There were pretty good reasons for why Euro was invented and those reasons still exist.

3. And if the EU didn't have power then guess who would have more power...

    A) Big European countries such as Germany, France and UK. 
Thanks to the having so much power the play field inside the union has been leveled, big countries can't for example discriminate against companies and individuals coming from other European countries. 

    B) External powers such as United States, Russia and China.
For example the US tried few years ago pressure the Finnish government on an issue of generic drugs, of course of the behalf of US drug companies, now before the EU they could have tried to pressurize by threatening with trade sanctions, but because Finland is part of the EU that has as much firepower to fight a trade war, the Finnish government didn't have to react in anyway. Then there are even more problematic neighbors like Russia, and some brutal ones like China.

The fact of the matter is that European countries alone are too small to this world with 7 billion people and counting. Actually when grouped together they can barely hang on. There are many negative sides in the EU, but then again there are so many good sides in it.

* ...a strong elected executive, that doesn't suite well into European parliamentarian tradition.  
* ...having elected senators to represent my state, that is too much power behind too few persons. We already have better arrangement by having of Council of ministers with political mandate given by the ruling cabinet and needed background information and assistance from the bureaucracies of ministries that allow national interests to be taken into account. What we could do is to have parliaments nominate senators that would then work besides the government of crafting national positions on different issues.
* ...the Commission must remain apolitical entity. In the future where senators (reformed Council of ministers) and the European parliament would have possibility to initiate legislation, the Commission would serve both of these groups as their executive arm.

true,Spelter,THUE,Thüringen,"The above have been my experiences as well and cover basically most of it. Just a few more details. (Note: I'm not Swabian and live in a protestant region so experiences may differ.) 

The above procedure also holds true for urns as cremation is usual and actually the predominant form of burial, at least where I live. Depending on how close you were to the deceased it is acceptable to wear dark non-formal clothing. So if you did not know the deceased and attend with someone else or in support of a relative dark pants and a shirt will do... as long as those don't look shabby. 

Usually in the chapel there is a book for condolences on a small podium. That book often covers a small slit where one can discreetly insert envelopes containing cards or money. 

As for flowers: There are no strict rules, often the deceaseds favourite flowers are brought. Also I've seen lilies, white roses, carnations, forget-me-nots and anything in between. Red roses however usually signify love, so if you did not lose someone very close to you you might want to forgo those. If in doubt just ask the florist they will gladly help you out if you tell them you are to attend a funeral. Again, depending on relation to the deceased flowers are not mandatory. Flowers are usually put down at the coffin/urn in the chapel as they are for the deceased, not for the family. Also in the chapel: when not very close to the deceased sit in the back or stand and let family and close friends sit in front. In smaller cemetary chapels in villages there might be very limited space inside, in that case doors will usually be open and many guests will stand outside to leave the interior and it's few seatings to family and close friends.  

The procedure where the guests line up to pass the grave, sprinkle some earth on the coffin or urn and then shake hands with or embrace the family is also not mandatory if you did not know the deceased very well. If you're there in support of a family member you may still go to show them your support though. In that case feel free to just give a brief handshake to the members of the family that you don't know. They probably don't know you either. The times when I've been on the receiving side of the condolences I found this procedure rather dreadful to be honest. Everyone's just standing there in line to tell you how sorry they are, for what seems like an eternity, all the while you're trying to not break down in tears. It's awful and pretty much brings up everything again even if you were pretty sure you dealt with the worst already. So by all means feel free to pass up on this if you and the deceased were not that close.

The gathering afterwards again is more for people close to the deceased. Often cards explicitly state that there is a gathering, if it doesn't it yould mean you're not invited. So if you're not invited, not attending because you were not close enough or if there is no gathering afterwards at all (not everyone does it) this is the point when you may leave.

Over all: If you're not required to be near the urn or coffin (read: not there with the family as boyfriend, girlfriend, spouse or not very close to the deceased) just hang back a bit. The procession from the chapel to the grave usually stretches out a bit and moves slowly, so just fall in a bit later and you should safely be able to watch what the other guests do and act accordingly.

Please note again: Protestant region and also not Swabian. There might be local customs I'm unaware of and a catholic funeral might be a whole bit more formal or following other stricter customs.",0,1322533892,null,0,true,0,c33k0ra,t3_mskbu,t1_c33k0ra,t1_c33ifx8,1427943452,5,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,5

I also wouldn't be so easy to attribute the economic growth of Sweden just to economic policy. It fits in a pattern, that was going on world wide, in all kinds of countries, with all kinds of economic policy.

Finally, it's near impossible to complete factor out the demographics themselves, and the speed of certain effects. For example, education, something available to everyone in Sweden (which is, internationally speaking, pretty 'social'), is something that bares fruit 10-15 years later.

In the end, I think we can all agree that a government controlling an economy is a silly thing. (with the most ridiculous example being the communist 5 years plan). But to equalize chances and opportunity, so everyone has a path to be productive, is a very smart bet.

There is no simple 'liberalize everything' or 'socialize' everything answer. Making the right policy is hard, complicated and nuanced. If anything, Sweden's economic success should be attributed to the actual discussion and quality of political debate and cultural sensitivities, that resulted in policy that damn near a perfect fit for that particular situation. 

Which brings me to my last point. Things change. What worked in the past, may not work in the future, and visa-versa. For example: culturally, a lot of the western world has become much more emancipiated. Technology has helped a lot in that area as well. With that in mind, a more liberal economic policy when it comes to individuals, may be more effective _now_ than it was _then_. On the other side of the fence, in the past corporations were more governed by moral standards of the people that led those companies. To even take morality into consideration when running a company, is almost a crime these days, hence it can be argued, that perhaps a less liberal economic policy may be a better fit for the corporate world _now_, than it was in the _past_.

I mean, Holland, where i'm from, is also a country where we complain, blame, confront and shame. Most of us can literally destroy our government verbally. But do any of us think it's better somewhere else? No, we don't. We actually believe that a cultural tendency to be critical may be a good thing. Even when it's nothing more than a cultural reflex. If we had traveled to the moon, most of us would respond with 'why the moon? why not something further away? look at all this money this is costing .. don't they have more important things to do..'.   But that's the point, isn't it. We didn't go. 

The 'can-do' spirit of America, really did result in some extrordinary results. They may fail their dreams even more often, then have been achieving things we're didn't consider possible, and then they took pride in them to fuel the next dream. It's something to think about.

What we should be talking about, is how to get there. Let's start with a European Public Broadcast Agency. I mean: these days a culture is a group of people that watches the same tv-channels and reads the same papers. If the referential context of a culture is too diverse, it's not really a culture any more, and people don't just disagree, they simply fail to understand where the other is coming from.

I know, i have found a new understanding of, for example, America, just by watching the Daily Show. And it's all in the little details. Like how there is not one american, but they are a diverse union of cultures and attitudes as well. Or how much time they spent travelling. Or just how big religion really is over there. I mean we have Christians too, but they have _Christians_ (tm). Ours wear that concept like a you would wear a FC-Barcalone t-shirt. Americans christians actually base their values on it. That's was completely new for me.

So, i think we should sort that shit out first; uniting our referential context. Those of us on Reddit are doing fine in this regard, but that isn't true the majority of people in Europe. They generally don't interact with other nations. 

We could off course, also come to the conclusion that we don't want to have a shared cultural context. But that choice has strong implications to what kinds of political unification is even possible.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"The EU is many things. It's a collection of treaties, but it's also a progress and a compromise. Let's look at the motivation, the theory, and finally practice.

Let's take a few steps back. In 1950, Europe had just come out of the most devastating war in history (in absolute figures) and was just beginning to rebuild. When you think about this, you cannot assume current conditions. This didn't just come barely a generation after ""the war to end all wars"", there was yet another major one between France and Germany still in living memory. Both the frequency, geographic extend and destructivity of those wars had gone up, not down. The idea that French foreign minister Robert Schuman laid out in his [Schuman Declaration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuman_Declaration) to solve this was to create a common market for coal and steel, and to thereby make war impossible through economic entanglement.

Now, on to the free market, into which this European Coal and Steel Community developed. If you accept that an economy is too complex to be administered centrally, then you need a self-organizing system. The free market is just that, and it optimizes towards financial efficiency. IMHO, the role of society is to internalize external costs, e.g., to put a price on carbon emissions.  
 
Why is efficiency desirable? Productivity is output per input (*not* total output). When overall productivity increases, you have to work less time for a higher standard of living (and to stick with the CO2 example, the less CO2 you emit if it has an internalized cost attached). This is achieved when people and companies specialize on something they're really good at, and rely on others to take care of the aspects that they have specialized on. Free trade lets you choose between a wider range of potentially cheaper (input) or better (output) suppliers. If you need a shelf, a carpenter will produce a better one in less time than you ever could. If you can also buy from the carpenters in the neighboring villages, you're more likely you are to find a better shelf for a lower price than you'd be able to if you had to stick to the only local one.

Your comment history suggests you're from Norway, which is far from the protected economy you seem to think it is. Norway joined the EFTA in 1960, which was a moderately large trade block at the time (ask your parents or grand parents how the Norwegian standard of living used to be), and has been a member of the EEA since 1994. So, no, you may not be in the EU, but you're part of the same common market and are subject to the same regulations. You just don't get to vote on them.

If you share a common market, you need common rules. This isn't just about manufacturing standards; if companies in one member state can work employees to death or can cut cost in workspace security, companies in another can't compete if they have to adhere to a higher standard. The same goes for environmental regulations.

Now, *how* those rules and regulations are decided on is another matter. Since the EU hasn't been designed from the ground up with a clean slate approach, this is a transition where nation states have to surrender sovereignty in all matters that become EU competences, and each step requires painful negotiations to find a compromise every member can agree to. This is, to say the least, rather complex and can only result in just that, a compromise solution. Most everybody will agree the results aren't ideal, the problem is to get them to agree what exactly the ideal would be.

Regarding your first point, this is simply not the case. As it is, practically all decisions have to be made unanimously. Yes, tiny countries like Malta or Cyprus can simply veto any decision. With 27 members, this is madness. As jrohila already explained, this has finally been addressed, and a (difficult) compromise has been found that takes the size of the population into account while at the same time preventing a small number of states with large populations to overrule the majority of smaller ones. 

Your impression probably stems from an observation of the current crisis, in the handling of which France and Germany indeed have disproportional power. But this is precisely because this is *not* properly covered by EU competences. To the contrary, the Treaty of Maastricht has a ""no bailouts"" clause, and Eurozone member states have full sovereignty over their budgets. Which is why we're in this mess in the first place. This, too, will be addressed, one way or the other.

It would be something people across national borders would try to elect in a cooperative effort.  

It seems without that unifying power, and a mandate from a majority of European people to the executive to lead the EU's future policies, there may be a risk of a logjam in parliament and too much regional infighting to get much done.

According to [this article](http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/05/01/2011/124945/RPA-hits-single-farm-payment-target.htm), 90,000 claimants equal 85% of the total, which would mean there's something like 105,000 total claimants. Almost an order of magnitude greater than the figure quoted in the guardians article.

In any case, I only have a comparatively tiny bit of land though and my SPS subsidy is hardly worth the mountain of paperwork I have to fill out every year to receive it. I still go through with it though, as every little helps.

Just for added info...

To get the subsidy you must leave 8% of your land as set aside (which you then earn no income from), and leave a 2m margin around every field (which again you then earn no money from). This last point also means farmers with smaller fields see a disproportionate decrease in yield compared to intensive farms with huge fields.

The parliament is divided in ideological fractions, not per nation. Political left is relatively strong here (especially compared to most of Western Europe).

2. Some liberalisations might have failed, but having an internal market is a good thing! Import and export are much easier, unfair market practices can be punished on an international level.

3. More of a Eurozone thing. While they are taking a long time, I believe the right choices will be made. They are trying to get out of a mess that has it origins in pre-EU times. In a diplomatical way. of course this isn't easy.

More or less related, I don't get why people are afraid to lose their state's sovereignity. All things considered this is an illusion.

Since then they consistently poll against joining. I can understand this position, especially now -- as a small country, the influence Norway would gain wouldn't make that much of a difference in practice (at least not after this ""everyone a veto"" madness is finally over), they already have access to the common market, and their citizens enjoy the right to move and work within the EU freely.

Still, I think a lot of this resentment, be it in Norway or somewhere within the EU, comes down to the lack of information and understanding. You seem to confuse the EU, the Eurozone and the EEA as well. They're all EU projects (as is the Schengen Area), but not all EU members are part of all treaties. The EEA is the common market, of which Norway is a member. The Eurozone is the currency union.

&gt; However, it has taken a lot of very sensible centralized decisions in controlling its particular brand of capitalism.

This hints at another misconception. Removing barriers of trade like duties and inconsistent regulation isn't the same as total deregulation. The EU sometimes intervenes quite heavily into the market, for example the maximum amount mobile phone providers can charge for international roaming fees is regulated. If your new smartphone can be charged via USB, then that's because the EU told manufacturers that it would pick one for them if they couldn't agree on a standard by themselves (Apple works around this by providing an adapter cable, which is apparently legal). The EU generally is great for consumer rights.  
There are plenty of things members can still do on a national level. This includes everything Norway does, after all, as an EEA member they're subject to the same laws and regulations as EU members. Other Nordic countries have similar policies as Norway, even as EU or even Eurozone members.

This is correct, and IMHO this is where society comes in. In your example, Coca-Cola's production has external costs to the society in the form of insufficient drinking water. Essentially, those are socialized costs. One of society's roles is to internalize those costs so they show up on companies' balance sheets, for example through a tax on industrial water usage. So, it becomes a matter of encoding society's goals in a manner the market optimizes for, which means putting a financial price on things.

Not every farm would vanish. There woudl be bigger farm units who could produce food more efficiently. 

But then again, why not? There is nothing wrong with wild land. If we want people to live in countryside, we can pay them directly, say 2000 EUR/month for each farmer for not doing anything and it would be much cheaper than farm subsidies.

That can be taken care of efficiently. All countries have plans for food security as part of their defense planning and we could move very small fraction of farm subsidies to keep small part of farming equipment and industry on hold. All this should be part of defense budget. If there is food crisis, we could take care of calorie adn nutritions for whole EU very efficiently. First by using stocks reserved for crisis and then starting to farm again. That's all basic crisis planning. Farm subsidies are something else.

Well, not really because the advisers and cabinet members have a research and implementation role, but the President chose between numerous options, and his ideology influenced it.  If the people desire a left leaning ideology they elect that, a right leaning one, they elect that.  Many of the important decisions have a pretty big ideology aspect to it rather than being strictly academic.

Holding a single non elected official accountable is not a satisfactory amount of accountability for decisions where millions of people's lives or livelihoods are at stake.

Because, quite frankly, who is qualified to review and judge the CV of someone to lead the EU in a crisis besides the people?  How can he be the legitimate leader of an entire continent (temporary as it may be) by simply submitting his application?  If the people deem that a strong CV is the most important factor in this, then they may still elect the person with the most impressive CV, or one who intends to fill and listen to his cabinet with impeccable CVs.

&gt;I think individual European countries' governments will still be able to keep an eye on a Europarlement and such ambassadors. The important thing is to keep the sovereignty of the countries as strong as possible. 

Individual European countries can not have it both ways.  Economic dominance, and being a world power require size and the ability to act.  Unfortunately the only way to pool this together is to cede a fair amount of sovereignty.  There really isn't a way around that.  If the EU wants the world to treat it as a unified bloc, it must act like it complete with a sovereign, legitimate, and strong central authority. 

Its completely up to the people though.  If its not what they want it is certainly not required of them.  Just understand that you can't have the benefits of a powerful union and autonomous nations simultaneously, as the current EU (as well as early US states) have shown us.",0,1322574242,null,0,false,0,c33o02p,t3_msc9k,t1_c33o02p,t1_c33nuwm,1427945399,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Wikipedia explains it like this: 

*""The bilateral approach, as it is called in Switzerland, was consistently supported by the people in various referenda. It allows the Swiss to keep a sense of sovereignty, due to arrangements when changes in EU law will only apply after a joint bilateral commission decides so in consensus.*
  
*The commission can never discuss or change contents, i.e. unlike full EU members, Switzerland has no influence over the contents of EU law that will apply. And while the bilateral approach officially safeguards the right to refuse application of new EU law to Switzerland, in practice this right is severely restricted by the so-called Guillotine Clause, giving both parties a right to cancellation of the entire body of treaties when one new treaty or stipulation cannot be made applicable in Switzerland.""*

true,redem,EURO,European Union,"&gt; If we want to prevent imported food, we should have tariffs and and other means. But because EU likes free trade, then yes. I think it would be jut fair for the rest of the free trading world that we would import most of our food (we could add provisions that prohibit importing subsidized food from coming EU)

We do, as a part of the CAP, use tariffs for imports from outside the free trade zone.

&gt; Not every farm would vanish. There woudl be bigger farm units who could produce food more efficiently.

Efficiency wouldn't matter too much when you're competing with places where the cost of labour is low, as well as the cost of environmental and employee protections.

&gt; But then again, why not? There is nothing wrong with wild land. If we want people to live in countryside, we can pay them directly, say 2000 EUR/month for each farmer for not doing anything and it would be much cheaper than farm subsidies.

Cheaper? No, really not. That would result in the breakup of larger farms into small farms with people looking for their €2000 per month for the easy life.

The CAP is expensive simply because of the scope of what it is trying to do.

&gt; That can be taken care of efficiently. All countries have plans for food security as part of their defense planning and we could move very small fraction of farm subsidies to keep small part of farming equipment and industry on hold. All this should be part of defense budget. If there is food crisis, we could take care of calorie adn nutritions for whole EU very efficiently. First by using stocks reserved for crisis and then starting to farm again. That's all basic crisis planning. Farm subsidies are something else.

That wouldn't work. You can't just rebuild, from scratch, a dead farming industry as soon as a crisis hits, by then you're already in too much trouble.

The UK was supplied by sea during WW2 and other countries have managed to survive in such a way. The EU is a large area and unlikely to be utterly blocaded. 

Secondly, land can be still kept - or bought by the state for food usage in fact it would probably work out better if the state purchased the land and let it revert to nature.

Thirdly, keeping the ""know-how"" is important but again storing the information in books or manuals is not hard and it is not like these technologies or industries would disappear just that they would scale back to a smaller size.

Je ne dis rien à propos du fait que l'ancien proprio rentre son code et fasse sa vie comme bon lui semble.

Je dis que devoir racheter un code si on achète le jeu d'occasion sur le PSN pour pouvoir jouer un perso (surtout qu'on parle d'une partie entière d'un jeu), c'est du vol pur et simple.

Edit 

&gt;La question de la location nous incite à nous interroger sur celle de l’occasion. Les
titulaires des droits d’auteur sur un jeu vidéo possèdent-ils une prérogative au sujet de la
revente des jeux d’occasion ? 


&gt;En effet, le marché de l’occasion dans le domaine du jeu vidéo,
s’il n’est pas récent, a atteint ces dernières années un volume important. Et nombre de
magasins spécialisés ne subsistent que grâce à l’occasion qui peut représenter jusqu’à la
moitié de leurs ventes totales. 

&gt;Les éditeurs de jeux vidéo, conscients de l’enjeu, ont essayé de
mettre un terme à ce marché parallèle en essayant d’interdire la revente des jeux d’occasion.
Ainsi l’on peut remarquer au dos de certains jeux la mention expresse « interdit à la revente ».
Si le droit de destination était reconnu, et à supposer qu’on lui donne pleine et entière
effectivité, il serait possible de considérer que le titulaire des droits d’auteur sur un jeu puisse en contrôler « non seulement les modalités de la commercialisation des exemplaires mais
aussi, en aval, certains usages faits par les acquéreurs ou les détenteurs^122 ».

&gt;94.-Cette approche serait en totale adéquation avec la formule de M. Gotzen^123 : « les auteurs
ont le pouvoir d’interdire à leur cocontractants comme à tout acquéreur ultérieur une ou
plusieurs formes d’utilisations déterminées des exemplaires de l’oeuvre ». Or **les auteurs
mêmes de la théorie du droit de destination admettent que l’auteur ne peut s’opposer à la
revente des exemplaires de son oeuvre. De plus l’application du principe communautaire de
libre circulation des marchandises conduit à l’épuisement du droit de distribution.** Ce principe
a été recueilli par le droit français s’agissant des logiciels à l’article L. 122-6 3° du Code de la
propriété intellectuelle qui dispose que « la première vente d’un exemplaire d’un logiciel dans
le territoire d’un Etat membre (…) par l’auteur ou avec son consentement épuise le droit de
mise sur le marché de cet exemplaire dans tous les Etats membres à l’exception du droit
d’autoriser la location d’un exemplaire^124 ».

&gt;Il en résulte que les titulaires des droits d’auteur sur un jeu vidéo ne peuvent en aucun
cas s’opposer à la revente, leurs prérogatives se limitent à la décision de première mise sur le
marché.

Bon, là, c'est presque la même chose: l'achat d'une semence protégée, issue d'un labo qui a dépensé des sous pour la concevoir, ne permet pas de réutiliser ces semences gratuitement à la saison d'après sauf pour les usages personnels du fermier (faire du fourrage par exemple). 

Ceci-dit, rien dans cette loi n'empêche Jean-Pierre l'agriculteur de le faire avec des semences non protégées.

We don't even have those on basic cable (which is what most people are on here in Holland, because it already has all the popular channels). Those channels are in the same 'extra' kind of package as say Al Jazeera. The basic package does include the BBC, the ARD, TV5, etc. 

Perhaps Europe should mandate it's inclusion, and make it free-to-air as well. (and actually cough up some dough to get series or important sport events, so people care enough to check the channel out)

&gt;Language is the key issue, here

Agreed. 

&gt;Austria, Switzerland, Luxemburg and Liechtenstein have a lot of common media,

Yes. The germans with their dubs. But their english is getting better as well. Getting rid of the dub-culture there (forcing them to switch to subtitles) would help in this regard.

&gt; as well as the Netherlands, who, despite all claims to the contrary, are a German people, too, with a language not more different than Standard German than other regions' varieties

Yes and no. Real (official) dutch, is a completely different language, with a different grammer, and almost no shared vocabulary with German.

What may be confusing, is that near the borders, people don't speak german or dutch. They speak some kind of transitory dialect. The people are at the dutch-german border, both speak the same language. One is considered a german dialect, the other a dutch dialect. I doubt a german person could understand them, I know I can't. For these people dutch or german is their second language, and the local dialect their native tongue.

&gt;and, consequently, usually speak perfect Standard German, usually better than your typical rural Bavarian

This is due to both education, holidays, and general dutch pro-learning-a-language mentality. But don't be mistakes, a good 70% of all dutch people, couldn't watch a German show and make out more than 1 of every 30 words. The dividing line being age: the new generations speak English very well, much better than their parents, but their German and French is weak. About half of them will develop enough language skills in either of those two, depending on their favorite holiday destination. (either they go skying in Austria or drink wine in France).

So, this has already changed, and it will become worse. The big difference is that most media consumed in Holland is now in English, rather than French or German. This started after WWII, but the last 15 years, all German TV and music just disappeared from our cultural context.. No more tattort, or that cop with a dog. 

At this point, seeing a French, Spanish or Japanese TV-show with subtitles is more likely than seeing a German show/movie/series. But it's nothing compared to 80% English spoken tv-shows (from UK/US/Australia/Canada/etc.) (and the 19,9% Dutch tv-shows)

Now, I do agree that the German language area is the largest in Europe, we would never be able to unite on that. I honestly think, with globalisation, English is inevitable. And i'm not talking about American english, or UK english, but internet english. World english. I really feel, it's best for everybody if we just standarize on English for media and government contexts. It's everybodies second language, including all kinds of immigrants. And it would allow our media to thrive as well, because local consumption just isn't enough for that, we need to export as well. If we want to become, as a diverse-but-united-culture a global leader, we need to be able to export our culture. And the international language is English.  It has adapted over the years to pretty much fit the whole world, and it's the only language that has adapted to the new media and technology. (is there a german lolspeak? a french sms-language?)

You also have to take into account that an elected executive can also be divisive and lead to people fighting with each others.

No, that is not an European way. In Europe we have parliamentary tradition where the parliament elects a prime minister to lead the cabinet that acts together as an executive. Usually the people or the parliament elect an president whose main duty is to oversee the cabinet and the parliament, and if needed brake up the cabinet or the parliament and hold new elections.

Now I did read your other comments too. Not having an elected executive doesn't mean that in time of national emergency or threat, the government couldn't act quickly and decisively. Usually prime ministers and the cabinet together hold considerable amount of power, and they can act under the operative envelope that has given to them. For example during the second world war both Britain and Finland were fully functional parliamentary democracies, and also in later times British cabinets have shown that they can act quickly, like for example when Argentina invaded Falkland islands.

And what goes to Europe being one of the main points in the multi-polar world and what it does require, I don't agree that would need a strong executive. Neither Britain or France had strong executives when they were colonizing the world in the 19th century, a parliamentary democracy with a will is quite enough to conquer the world. However this is not 19th-century and Europe is not about or going to take on the world, what we need is consensus based decision making with strong institutions that can like a machine solve rationally and peacefully problems that come ahead of us.

So has Low Saxon, and it's considered a German, too... and there's a lot of shared vocabulary, if you disregard the consonant and vowel shifts. Not Standard German, but *a* German. Den anderen ihre Grammatik is mir doch eh egal.

&gt; I doubt a german person could understand them, I know I can't.

It's hard to find any northern German who can't at least read Dutch. There's some false friends to look out for (e.g. deftig), but you're going to find the train station. Knowing Standard German won't help you much understanding those border dialects, as they're dialects of Low Saxon, not Standard German. 

I knew this is going to provoke a reaction. A language is a dialect with an army and a football team, no matter how orange.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"I would say that a minority of people tend to idealize the US and this group of people have been decreasing in number for quite a long time. And this is not because of the current financial crisis in the US, but it goes deeper. Let me open this one as I too once used to see US system in more positive light and more as an example, but not anymore. Here are few reasons for it...

* USA is a major oil and gas producer itself with amble of other natural resources. US currently produces approx 30% of oil and 100% of gas it uses. This gives the US economy a tremendous boost of production and wealth: it is easier to pump oil from the ground than producing goods to buy that oil. We in the EU don't have the boost from natural resources, we have to buy that from external sources, still our GDP per capita (nominal) is quite close to the US, so our system must be not functioning that bad.
* In US and in Britain in the last 30 years there has been a bigger economic growth, but there are lots of question marks over it. What I mean is that in both places there has been a large decrease of public sector and services it has provided. While this diverted money into other sectors of economy, I would claim that has also caused a decrease of human capital that is starting to show. In essence while public services where cut in the 80s, the 80s children still inherited manners and values from their parents generation, with each succeeding generation the amount of inherited human capital from generation to generation has decreased, as the public sector hasn't guided, helped, schooled and otherwise pumped that needed capital to people. So for example if we cut public services more, do we really gain wealth, or are just blundering our inheritance...
* US isn't actually a that capitalistic, it is entrepreneur and corporate friendly, but that doesn't make it a working model. For example in the US states and counties can give tax exemptions to corporations that invest there. This is wrong, this state interfering the market and causing market corruption. In this case companies don't necessarily locate their work where it actually is most efficient, but where state subsidy makes is most profitable for the corporation. In the EU we don't have this, states and local authorities can't give subsidies to firms, at least not in the same way and scale as they do in the US.
* US and Britain aren't anymore as much meritocracies that they used to. If you don't have free health care, social housing and benefits, free education, etc.. you really can't say that every child regardless of their background has equal opportunities. And while few people here and there have success story from rags to riches, most people are still left behind. That in time will cause bitterness and feeling of social injustice. In here, and in many other European countries, you can't really complain that you missed education or other opportunities because of your background, no, you missed them because you didn't take opportunities that the society offered to you.
* European states that have high income economies, like for example Nordic countries, offer a quite nice mix of everything, a pleasant life. Like I said I used see US potential place where to move and start a life, and so did many others, but after graduating, getting that first job, this place actually feels quite good. Yes, I pay lots of taxes, but then again I get quite nice place for that.

I don't want to be America basher, but these are my reason why I don't see US and their system as that good example. I think that many do share these same feelings. Of course there are many good things in US system that we could copy, but not everything. And by the way I'm liberal conservative, liberal in personal freedom, and conservative in economics, to give you some background on my thoughts.

I myself think that we in Europe really have to look up all around the world, lift good things from different societies and economies, see what fits well to ours, and then innovate something new when needed. Again I think that this attitude is shared by quite many.

P.S. One thing that explains why many European countries have decreased their welfare states is that people don't anymore see lack of money as the underlying cause for many of the sicknesses in our societies. Yes, money can fix things into a certain point, but after that it doesn't anymore help, it actually more harm to the society. For example my work colleague, who is hard core leftist but not a communist, thinks we shouldn't throw more money to poor people, but we should concentrate on thinking how we can activate/motivate/force them doing something in their life. I myself don't see it wise to force people for example to work, I would prefer to increase control of how people use their welfare money, and if necessary obligate them to go into re-education. For example one of my friends, a metal worker, has been unemployed soon for 2 years, recently they had a program in his locality were they offered to school unemployed to truck drivers, and because a private firm was also involved in the schooling, there was very big likelihood on that people would get a job from them. However my friend didn't get excited about, didn't apply, it is a not job for him, even though he is very good in handling mechanical machines... So that is why many European states seem to move into the direction of America, but I don't think that majority really wants us to become a copy of America.",0,1322589850,null,0,false,0,c33q4ex,t3_mscui,t1_c33q4ex,t1_c33ne13,1427946398,38,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,38

I think we are arguing this from two different POV's. You are considering it from the origins of the language, and in that regard I agree. But much like how Spanish and French are both latin based languages, it doesn't mean you can understand each other.

&gt;It's hard to find any northern German who can't at least read Dutch. 

Seriously? That's impressive! And I was always under the impression that dutch is ridiculously complicated.

But it's not the true the other way around. I can sort of read Danish, but not German. And they actually tried teaching me for years (because it's mandatory in school, it's just that you don't ever learn a language at school, or at least, many don't)

&gt;&gt;is there a german lolspeak?
&gt;Oh hell, yes.

I didn't consider it very likely, because it would require Germany to have a sense of humor ;-) 

&gt;..is the surest way to kill it. At least its literary qualities, that is.

I'm not suggesting we all start speaking English with our families and neigbours. Hell, no. But much like how the dutch at the german border, can switch between 'official dutch' and their 'local dialect', there could be something equivalent at a European scale. 

And for some part, we are already there .. 

- most if not every interaction with any government in Europe, has English translations (for immigrants, foreign companies, etc.). 

- most press releases are dual language. Just because the international press may pick up on it.

- many music artists have switched to English, even if they are native Dutch, French, Belgium, Danish or German artists. Not all, and they don't have to. But they've discovered that their market is just way bigger, if they switch to the 'world language'.

- a large portion of all scientific research and education is English based. Books written by dutch authors, papers by German researchers, etc. 

Please, let's not kill the local languages or local cultures. But let's have a single 2nd language for everyone in Europe, that we can agree on, that's accessible, and allows us to also export our culture outside of Europe. At the moment, only UK has that privilege: consider things like Monty Python, Beatles or Doctor Who. People know about those things all over the world. And it's because it's in English. 

To have our media make that switch, isn't any more painful, than the media not talking in whatever local dialect.

&gt;When and if English is going to become a true world language, the British are going to insist on calling it something different than English because it's going to have been mauled by a battalion of non-native speakers

This is a good thing. One of the reasons for resistance to English adoption in certain European countries (for which they've payed an economic price), is nationalism. ""We don't like America, so we won't speak English with a dutch tourist, even though we do have the skills"". So we'll try French, and they try a little dutch. It's fun, but not very effective. I mean, it makes holidays more interesting, but I wouldn't want to do business with the French. The translation nightmare in Brussel is shocking, and the price we pay for that (in political effectiveness, cost, and understanding) is huge. 

To separate this 'world english' from those political connotations, sounds like a blessing. We failed with Esperanto, but the way English, at least on the internet is progressing, there will be a real Esperanto. Not made up by scientists, but as a true language of the people. All the people. 

And yeah, we stole that language, but that's how most languages are born!

Yes. I can read both reasonably well. But it's still a one way street. I can read, but I would not be able to write it, and I doubt I would understand it verbally, because of the speed. 

And my normal dutch is the 'official dutch' .. spoken by most people everyday. We may differ a little in accent, but most if not all of us, can switch to any of the accents. And they really only differ in how they verbalize the same sentence. 

We don't have the same high/low language structure, that Germany has. There is official dutch, a bunch of accents (which aren't dialects), and at the border with Germany there are true dialects. 

One of the accents is semi-official. It's what the queen speaks, and what news readers would use. People tend to refer to it, as the accent of the children songs of ""Kinderen voor kinderen"" (children for children), which were mostly children from 't Gooi, where media-people live. But on TV and in real life you tend to hear all accents mixed. The accents all only differ in three things:

- how they pronounce the ""G"" and ""SCH"" (sounds like S+G). The G is either growled or soft (like the Vlamish do)

- the R either sounds American, like 'are' (which melts with the vowel) , or ""rolling"" like ""rrrr"" (like in German)

- then there is the melody to the sentence. You can either emphasize every vowel sound and then make the last vowel of a sentence long with a pitch up. You can end the sentence mubbling a bit, or you can keep all the vowel sounds short and crisp. 

All accents are different configurations of those three things. When people lived in those places, or have been mixed a lot (study, work) with people from another accent, they tend to develop their own specific configuration of these three aspects. And this is true for almost everybody.

In the end, the original accents, only exist in jokes, when we make fun of each other, and a few weird exceptions. If you don't consider the true dialects at the borders, and the Frisian in the north, you end up with a region, where the maximum travel time is never more than an hour and half.  It's a bit like the Rurh-area, I guess.

So, unlike German, there really is a true Dutch that's not just official, but also utilized day in day out by millions, and the differences in accents are slim. And as far as a large majority is concerned, the dialects are incomprehensible mublings of half-dutch-half-german people.

The price of the dorm depends on the income, there are individual rooms and rooms for two people (individual are more expensive). But on the dorm you have three meals a day (and if you can't go to have lunch some days because of your timetable, they give you vouchers for food on the bar on the campus), and they clean your room every two weeks. Also, 100mb ethernet at your room (yipee!). And meeting lots of new people, and that sort of stuff.

And then you can find someone to live with and rent a flat together (or rent a room). This will be probably cheaper, but you'll have to cook then. For example, we're 3 people on a 70m^2 house which we rent for 700€/month in total (+water/electricity/phone/internet/etc). I lived the previous 2 years on the dorm until they raised prices to like 800€ for an individual room (prices depend on your/your parents income). 

For the difference.. well, in fact, it depends on the zone. Madrid (as in, the city and not the region) is quite big and there are cheaper and more expensive zones. Living on the center of Madrid will probably be more expensive, as you get apart from the center prices will probably get lower. Take a look at [Idealista](http://www.idealista.com), you can find shared-flats advertisements from all over Spain on there.

Also, take into account: Biomedical Eng. started on the UC3M the last course. The biomedical labs were in fact opened on January. This might mean they don't have a lot of resources/experience... or maybe it means they have all the newer material. My degree is communications related so I'm not sure  about the state of those.

true,thelittlebig,EURO,European Union,"Many of the arguements in this thread look at far to big a picture. You need to look at the subsidies based on country, style of farming, size of farm, location of farm and what products they churn out.  
Producing rice in southern France in areas formerly protected from farming is useless and counter productive. On the other hand it is a smart policy to slowly reduce subsidies for pig producing farms so that they can adapt to the changing situation instead of killing them all of by going to zero subsidies in one year. Also it is in our interest to give subsidies to styles of farming we want to encourage, which we can than supervise much better than we could do in other countries. Also we have subsidies for farmers in areas were groundwater is used for drinking water. They use less chemicals as fertelizers and get some money compensation. (That is not to much)  
In this way the number of farms is steadily declining and the size of the remaining ones increases, making them more economic. In Germany for example it is a common saying among farmers that one third of farmers is to deep in debt, one third is in debt and the last third is rich. Taking into account the distribution of the agrar industry across Europe and the different products in different areas is very important here. One third of Chickens, pigs and potatoes in Germany are produced in lower Saxony where the industry profits greatly from the low distance to Denmark and the Netherlands where there are also a lot of farms/factories in this industry. On the other hand the farms are right now still much smaller in lower Saxony than in Eastern Germany. In the long term lower Saxony will be more profitable for farming than Eastern Germany due to the concentration of the industries and knowledge. But right now reducing the subsidies to zero in Lower Saxony would kill farming there, which is organized around centuries old practices in some more rural areas where the big farmers of the future still depend on the small ones.  
What I am saying is, just raging at something without going into details is easy. There is a point here of course, the German milk producing farmers, although they demonstrate all the time are actually pampered to much. They are just right now going through what pig producing farms went through in the 90s.  
Also we need to include national policies in these considerations, there is a big difference between Spain slowly turning into a desert due to water shortages and Germany that actively counters slowly decreasing farming subsidies by investing so much money into renewable energy which is essentially a handout to farmers.",0,1322604166,null,0,false,0,c33sqhp,t3_mt6fo,t1_c33sqhp,t3_mt6fo,1427947642,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Price is a signal, if something is more expensive because it is not being subsidised then people will either consume less or seek alternatives, if there are no alternatives then they are somewhat stuck. 

At the moment the true cost of food is hidden from consumers because money is taken away in taxation and given to farmers to ensure prices are reduced (amongst other things). So I have no idea what the ""true"" cost of milk is. If I did I might alter my behaviour and not be so wasteful.

When you move through Berlin you can easily destinguish areas were people (or a government or group at some time) ""wanted"" certain things to be remembered or the other way around.

What's funny about this is that if you'd try to evade all the places that are in some way a more or less important connection to the past, you could barely move at all.

I don't know much about differences between former east/west sides but I don't think they really show up. You have to know where to look. Tram is mainly in the east part, Subway mainly in the west. Things like that. If you go to the less famous places you can see more differences.

What I think is unforgiving about Berlin is not that the history itself is in a way haunting the city. It's all the people who haunt the city with architectural quotes or other memorials. I don't really mind one or two but this city is covered with them. Literally. Also you can't really say that architecture somehow left neoclassizism behind it can you?

From the Verkehrsnetz it appears that Freising is on the border between ring 2/3, which suggests that if he's only going between central Munich and Freising he should only need 2 rings. **YET**, when you actually look more closely a ring is completely separate from a *zone*.

Anyway, to summarize:


- The Freising S-Bahn station is at the border of the rings 12 and 13 which also is the border of the yellow and red zone.


- If a station is at the border of any ring or zone, you can save money by buying a ticket for the lower-numbered ring or lower (more central) zone since tickets of both sides will be valid for a border station.


- Tickets can be related to either rings or zones but never both. You can see an overview of the rings and zones [here](http://www.mvv-muenchen.de/de/tickets-preise/tarifplaene/index.html) (click on ""Tarifplan Gesamtnetz"" for the whole MVV public transport area).


- **The cheapest monthly ticket for your intentions is the IsarCard9Uhr. It costs *65.30€ a month*, includes ALL zones and enables you to use all means of non-high-speed-rail public transportation (Bus, Tram, U-Bahn [subway], S-Bahn, Regionalbahn).**

The only restriction is that this ticket is not valid from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. on Monday to Friday. Apart from these 3 hours early in the morning on Monday to Friday, it is valid around the clock.

I think that this is a fair and neglectable restriction if you do not need the ticket for work-related transportation. Should you for some reason really need to use the public transportation system between 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., your only other choice of a monthly ticket is the regular IsarCard for 142.70€ which includes all rings up to ring number 12 and has no restrictions on time at all.

Personally, I think that the half-price deal with the IsarCard9Uhr is the more preferable choice here. :)",0,1322623139,null,0,true,0,c33vsra,t3_mtvnx,t1_c33vsra,t3_mtvnx,1427949140,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3
