Even avoid taking any new loans, **avoid paying any interest at all**, and pay back 10% of their tax income to the debt every year, it's going to take 35 years to clear that.

At the moment, they are taking new loans at 10% of the tax income per year to pay for the benefits that are not covered by taxes, so this would mean very roughly a 20% drop in the standard of living for the next 35 years. There is no way the public will accept that.

Schengen is a fantastic idea, and along with programs like Erasmus, is what the EU should be - a customs and movement union.  If the EU were Schengen with some economic cooperation and trade bits thrown in, I would be 100% in favor of Swiss membership.

I find the Swiss customs regime a pain in the ass.  We've been schizophrenic about what we call ""parallel imports"" for some time now, and it's led to monopolistic/oligopolistic pricing and bureaucratically imposed advantages for early market entrants that only serve to hurt Swiss customers.  It also drives up wages, which is nice in the short run but makes the Swiss economy less competitive.  You want to hear even more silliness?  Switzerland has a ""border zone"" of 19km within any frontier, if you live within which your import taxes for any foreign goods are almost double those of the rest of the country.

Free trade is good, tax competition (including VAT) is good.  You should be able to effectively fight organized smuggling of ""restricted"" goods (i.e. those with punitive taxes, like cigarettes and maybe alcohol) with good police work, without resorting to border controls, but if you find that people are smuggling in sufficient amount of consumer goods without paying import tax (and excessive EU-mandated minimum VAT) then maybe the problem is a bit deeper.

No offense taken, I was mostly joking. ;) Switzerland is part of Schengen after all.

&gt; Schengen is a fantastic idea, and along with programs like Erasmus, is what the EU should be - a customs and movement union. If the EU were Schengen with some economic cooperation and trade bits thrown in, I would be 100% in favor of Swiss membership.

One very important aspect of the EU is the unification of trade laws, economic rights, economic development laws, and general financial cooperation. This makes it easier for companies to operate on the continent, and it makes life more efficient for all Europeans if we can interact freely and without restriction.

&gt; Free trade is good, tax competition (including VAT) is good. You should be able to effectively fight organized smuggling of ""restricted"" goods (i.e. those with punitive taxes, like cigarettes and maybe alcohol) with good police work, without resorting to border controls, but if you find that people are smuggling in sufficient amount of consumer goods without paying import tax (and excessive EU-mandated minimum VAT) then maybe the problem is a bit deeper.

I disagree that tax competition is good, but let's not get into that. I think the problem in this case, as it's presented rhetorically, is that poor people from Eastern Europe travel to Denmark to rob houses (often summer houses which are vacant in the winter). Of course, a customs checkpoint will do absolutely nothing to change this. :)

At the same time, this will make precisely zero change to the amount of smuggling that goes on, since a checkpoint at the German border does nothing to prevent anyone from jumping on a boat in German and rowing to whatever island they happen to hit in Denmark (there's 7314 km of coastline, you should have a pretty good chance of hitting something :D).

&gt; Over the past years I have seen at least the trade and economic aspects of the EU go in a positive direction - things like border controls are a wrong reaction to something that could be addressed in a better way.

Definitely. This is purely symbolic. But the symbolism is, of course, important. I would love for the Danes to be more enthusiastic about the Union.",0,1305214028,null,0,false,0,c1tp4l1,t3_h944m,t1_c1tp4l1,t1_c1tnx5u,1427141090,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

This is a huge problem in Switzerland too - and although it's often politely ignored, a vast proportion of the gangs are Romanian, and sometimes Bulgarian.  This is what caused a lot of consternation in my country, because during initial membership discussions for Schengen, the Swiss were promised to be able to vote at a later date because they wanted to include those two countries, and subsequently told, no, you're taking the whole package or the EU will annul all its trade and other bilateral deals.

Now France and Germany are trying to delay accession - fun.

Yes, preventing smuggling via partially closed borders, especially when you have a coastline, is pointless.  That is why I brought up the idea of police work being a far more effective tool.

And while I agree, the subject of tax competition is off topic here, I nonetheless think that it deserves its own discussion - insofar as it is relevant for a specific kind of smuggling (e.g. people going shopping abroad and not paying import/VAT when they bring stuff back).

Es gibt zwar eine  [Grundrechtecharta](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charta_der_Grundrechte_der_Europ%C3%A4ischen_Union), die spielt aber in der Praxis keine Rolle.

Wichtig ist hier [die EU-Verodnung](http://cdn.zensus2011.de/live/uploads/media/Verordnung_des_Europaeischen_Parlaments_und_des_Rates.pdf), die eine Volkszählung vorschreibt.

Wie der Spiegel-Artikel schreibt, haben auch die deutschen Statistiker nichts mit dieser Fragestellung zu tun, das kommt direkt aus der Bundespolitik, und die hat es natürlich vermasselt.

Die Basis dieser Fragestellung ist in §7 IV Nr. 18, 19 [ZensG 2011](http://cdn.zensus2011.de/live/uploads/media/Zensusgesetz_2011.pdf) zu finden. Da also EU-Recht dieser Formulierung nicht entgegensteht, kommt nur ein Verstoß gegen das [GG](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grundgesetz_f%C3%BCr_die_Bundesrepublik_Deutschland) in Frage; dieses schützt zwar die positive und negative Religionsfreiheit in [Art. 4 I,II](http://dejure.org/gesetze/GG/4.html), aber ob diese durch eine missglückte Fragestellung auf einem Zensusbogen verletzt wird, ist doch sehr fraglich.

Ich bin dreiundzwanzig Jahre alt. Mein Geburtstag ist am 18. März und interessanterweise hat mein Vater am nächsten Tag Geburtstag. Normalerweise haben wir unsere Party miteinander. Jetzt habe ich eine Freundin mit der ich in Oshkosh wohne. Seit April sind wir zwei Jahre zusammen. Wir sind Studenten um UW-Oshkosh und wir studieren Finanzen und Buchhaltung. 
Ich arbeite fȕr mich. Ich bin ein Unternehmer. Ich führe ein Bergungs- und Recyclingunternehmen. Mein Unternehmen ist sehr klein, aber wȁchst schnell. Meine Mutter in Iowa führt ein sehr großes Recyclingunternehmen und sie bildet mich aus. Wenn ich bin nicht arbeite, gehe ich gern aus. Meine Freundin und ich gehen gern in die Kneipe mit unseren Freunden. Wenn ich in Kneipen gehe, ist mein Lieblingsgetrȁnk ein Whiskey Sour. In meiner Freizeit lese ich auch gern. Mein Lieblingsbuch ist “Starship Troopers” von Robert Heinlein.

Alles über meine Familie und Freunde:

Ich habe eine große Familie. Meine Eltern sind nicht mehr zusammen. Ich habe einen Stiefvater und eine Stiefmutter. Meine Mutter und Stiefvater leben in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Sie führen das Recyclingunternehmen gemeinsam. Wenn ich sie besuche, gehe ich zu unserem Haus am See. Meine Mutter heißt Kelley und mein Stiefvater heißt Mike. Sie sind sehr humorvoll und ich mag es sie zu sehen und zu besuchen. Meine kleine Schwester Kiley lebt mit ihnen. 
Mein Vater John und meine Stiefmutter Michelle leben in Tutzing, Deutschland. Meine zwei kleinen Brüder, Jacob und Noah, leben mit ihnen. Tutzing ist eine kleine Stadt in Bayern und liegt fünf Bahnhalte von München entfernt. Ich mag es sie zu besuchen, aber es ist sehr teuer zu fliegen. Einen Flug von Chicago nach München dauert acht Stunden.
Ich habe auch einen großen Bruder. Er heißt Justin und ist fünf Jahre älter als ich und hat eine Tochter. Meine Nichte heißt Alayna und sie ist sehr schön. Sie ist elf Monate alt. Ich sehe sie nicht sehr viel.

In dieser Zeit mache ich normalerweise meine Hausaufgaben. Meine Deutschvorlesung fängt um zehn Uhr zwanzig an. 
Ich mag meine Deutschvorlesung, aber ich spreche nicht sehr gut Deutsch. Ich möchte besser sprechen, wenn ich nach Deutschland gehe. Ich sollte mehr Deutsch studieren. Nach meiner Deutschvorlesung ich habe eine lange Pause.

I have noticed over the years that because of the difference in the way Europe and the US report GDP, there is often an assumption that the US is doing very well while the EU is slow and sclerotic and blah blah blah.

This difference in reporting has to do with an emphasis on either quarterly or or annualised or annual GDP. Here is the explanation:

Quarterly: How much GDP has increased since the previous quarter.

Annualised: The quarterly result multiplied by four.

Annual: How much GDP has increased since the same quarter of the previous year.

So according to the official Eurostat release, and if we use quarterly / annualised / annual:

US: 0.4% / 1.6% / 2.3%

""political party"" translates to ""politische Partei"", but ""birthday party"" is ""Geburtstagsfeier"" (from Geburtstag and Feier)

If you use ""who"" in a question, to ask for a person, it's translated as ""wer"". If you use it to refer to a person, it's translated as one of the articles ""der/die/das"". Examples:

* Who is it? -&gt; Wer ist es?
* The woman who sings (is this even correct English? I would use ""that"" instead of ""who"") -&gt; Die Frau, die singt
* The man who sings -&gt; Der Mann, der singt
* The child who sings -&gt; Das Kind, das singt

About ""I am working"". This ""to be"" + ""ing"" form [apparently](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_and_progressive_aspects#German) doesn't exist in standard German (which means I'm not speaking standard German). So it might be best not to use it: ""I am working"" -&gt; ""I work"" -&gt; ""Ich arbteite"".

""When"" is funny, too :) It can be ""wenn"" or ""wann"" in German. I *think* if you can substitute ""when"" with ""if"" (even if the meaning changes), it got to be ""wenn"". On the other hand ""wann"" is for asking for a time.

* When I visit them -&gt; Wenn ich sie besuche
* If I visit them -&gt;  Falls ich sie besuche
* When will I visit them? -&gt; Wann werde ich sie besuchen?
* If will I visit them? is not even grammatical English.

e.g.

""How did you like the soup I made for you?""

I don't want to commit myself to outright lying about it being tasty in case you get the wrong idea and make it again, and I don't want to embarrass either you or I by saying I hated it.


The real key to understanding ""very interesting"" is the modifier applied to it - usually either ""and"" or ""but"".

e.g.

""The soup was very interesting **and** (something something something)""  -&gt; I am responding with some positivity.


""The soup was very interesting **but** (something something something)"" -&gt; I am responding with some negativity.


The soup was very interesting."" (no modifier). -&gt; Let's save ourselves some embarrassment and not discuss this further.

True.

Very true.

It's technically true, but you have to remember that the loans didn't really support a spending binge for the tax payers. It was mostly lost to corruption, inefficiencies and to cover the hole tax evasion left.

True.

Still, if you're forcing Greece to sell its best assets off in return for the bailout money, Greece may prefer to take the risks of restructuring and take you down with it.

-Ségolène Royal: she had been Sarkozy's opponent in the last elections and since her loss and when Aubry become first secretary of the party rather than her, she has never managed to regain quite the same momentum as during the election. It seems she's trying to get back on the horse but she has lost some contributors and is less visible in the media as before.

-Martine Aubry: actual first secretary of the PS, logically, she should be the one running but her image and ideas has her as more on the left side of the PS, which would hinder the parties effort to open up to the center parties during the election.

-François Hollande: a long time First secretary of the PS, during the 90's and a good part of the 00's. He is a little bit difficult to gauge because he more or less has always maintained himself closer to the background before, letting others go for the big elections, which was the case with Jospin. Nevertheless, he is today the most visible candidate, one that is truly campaigning already. His ideas are closer to the center than Aubry's.

The problem today is that DSK was the 'natural' candidate. The fact that he was far from France, preventing him from falling into any internal policies booby trap, all the while bein proactive in an important international role has made him very popular in France. That is until this scandal and the smaller one that came before where he was seen driving a Porsche. It might come out that is this is not assault but simply an affair, the Porsche scandal might hinder him more; the French don't like people showing that they have money but don't mind as much sex affairs, I mean seriously every politician bangs there secretary. 

So, now, the problem with the PS today is that their candidate will be chosen through a 'primary election', to which anybody can vote, even if they are not a member of the PS. This makes it very difficult to predict who will be the candidate, all the more because DSK, who was enjoying an important lead, mostly because he attracted a more right wing crowd, is probably out of the race now.

If Northern Ireland wants to remain part of the UK, why should the Republic of Ireland  have a say in that? Just like how the rest of the UK states shouldn't have a say, that is entirely up to the Northern Irish. It think it would be bullshit to say otherwise, it would be like the Scots have a referendum on independence but then counting votes from the English and the Welsh at the same time, it's a decision for the Scots to make and no one else.

Now if Northern Ireland wanted to separate from the rest of the UK, and then join the Republic of Ireland, then it would be a case of all of Ireland voting with the south voting on whether to accept the north and the north voting on whether to join the south if the south allow it.
