true,VomisaCaasi,ESTO,Estonia,"Well put.

I'm afraid this all goes even further. The occupation that took place 1721 - 1918 couldn't really be comparable to the Soviet Union because all administrative, legal and educational matters were still left to be handled by Germans. Something that they used to be doing since 13th century. Also, we accepted capitalism quite enthusiastically between those periods (1918 - 1939) as before WWII our GDP per capita well exceeded even Finland's. 

So my only real theory is that this stigma was created after 1941, when Germany retook us from Russia (1939 -1941). At the time, we also knew what we were up against, as over 30,000 Estonians had already been deported to Siberia in 1941, and so most Estonians thought they could regain their independence through aligning their forces with German army. Although the mentality in those forces was pro-Estonian, it never was pro-Nazi (UN later on acknowledged that). In 1944, Russians came back and that was that.

I just can't see how this all translates to contemporary world where we've once again accepted capitalism, and we even have growing support for a party that is leaning heavily towards Scandinavian social-democratic model (I think that's a first among post-soviet countries). Could it be that the Kremlin is just trying to shift focus from it's own innerproblems to us, just because, well, we fought ""for"" the Nazis in the WWII, and is basically looking for a scapegoat?",0,1301619870,null,0,true,0,c1n9u9a,t3_gfmh2,t1_c1n9u9a,t1_c1n9iko,1427029665,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

""Problema"" is masculine in Italian (and has only one ""m""). Although most Italian words ending in ""a"" are feminine, words ending in ""-ma"" that are of Greek origin are usually masculine. Other examples: ""un dramma"" (a play), ""un tema"" (a subject, a theme), ""uno\* schema"" (a plan).

&gt; negli Stati -&gt; negli Stati Uniti

""The United States"" or ""the States"" is always ""gli Stati Uniti"". There is no shortened form ""gli Stati"" in Italian.

&gt; un po -&gt; un po'

This has an apostrophe because it is short for ""un poco"".

&gt; Spagnolo -&gt; spagnolo

Names of languages don't have initial capital letters in Italian. (Hence also ""italiano"" and ""inglese"" in gosp's post.)

The streets were definitely safer before the last ten years immigrant tsunami. Every time you go out to the street, it can be your last time, especially for children and women in the evening. A video answer ""To Russia with hate"" starring some immigrants could be done, and try to guess which one will be more scary!

Of course Russian neo-nazis with swastikas and hitler-worshipping are ridiculous and pathetic. However there are so few of them i've never met one in my life. I am sure the ratio of immigrants to neo-nazis is at least 50000 to one, and their efficiency is zero. I don't support violence, it's too late, nothing can help now.
The immigrants are the reason I am moving from Russia to Europe. I want my children to grow in a little bit safer place, and my family will assimilate as much as possible.

Ce que j'appelle ""touriste moderne"" c'est ceux qui privilégient les bars, les concerts, les musées modernes aux visites des monuments historiques par exemple ! I tend to look for quirky things when I visit places.

Haha I always thought that about pho! Asian, you'll need to look on trip advisor as I don't visit those in Paris much (although I did go to the most disgusting Asian food place last weekend - a place called Zen Zoo which also does fancy teas and is EXTREMELY high rated on internet; avoid at **all** costs. My food was the worst thing I've been served in restaurants in about ten years, even my friend couldn't swallow it...) There's a crêperie that's even higher-rated than the ones I told you about called Café Breizh in the Marais, it's usually packed so you'll need to book or go at a weird hour.

Oui, il y a des supers expos à Pompidou en ce moment ! I really recommend le Musée du Quai Branly, ouvert depuis quelques années ; il est entouré d'un magnifique jardin qui devrait être sympa en Mai ! En printemps/été le jardin du luxembourg a un marchand à son entrée qui vend le plus de parfum de glace que j'ai pu voir en un seule endroit... Sinon il y a les Pâtisseries Ladurée ou Pierre Hermé (de grand pâtissiers français) qui servent des choses délicieuses... Il y a le musée d'art moderne de la ville de Paris aussi qui est moins connu et très sympa. Maintenant que j'y pense, le Paradis du fruit est une chaîne de restaurant très sympa et à tout petit prix; I'd describe it as healthy, fruity food. for about 16€ you can get one of their mixed platters with poached eggs, hummus, potatoes, brochettes and anything from a large list (stay away from the tzatziki) and they have faaaaabulous deserts including frozen yoghurt, large ice creams with fruit etc.
If you want to eat something typically French, try a 'fondue' place. big pots of cheese that you dip things in and meat to put on a grill.

true,thehappyhobo,IREL,Ireland,"Ireland's debt problem stems from two distinct but interconnected problems:

1. Low interest rates and poor regulation led to one of the largest property bubbles anywhere in history. When Lehman Bros went under, investors in Irish banks got spooked and they couldn't access credit. The banks came to government claiming that they were facing a liquidity crisis, which was serious, but by its nature short term. The government responded by guaranteeing all of the banks' liabilities. It later emerged that the banks were in fact *insolvent* not illiquid and over the ensuing two years €70bn would have to be injected into the banks.

2. During the property boom, the government reduced income taxes and increased spending to win elections. It was able to this because the tax receipts from property transactions were so high. When the bubble burst, this income dried up. This was compounded by the fact that most employment growth between 2002 and 2008 was in the construction sector. As these people lost their jobs they joined the dole queue increasing the government's spending commitment.

The [government's budgetary response](http://www.irisheconomy.ie/index.php/2011/03/22/behaving-like-teenagers/) and the public acceptance of it is, by historical standards, impressive. However, the outstanding sovereign liabilities are now so high that Ireland appears to be entering a debt spiral - the deflation from cutting further and faster will eviscerate the budget surpluses needed to repay our debts.

Corporation tax is only linked to this problem in a very indirect way. The peripheral budget crises in Europe arose because those countries didn't undertake the discipline needed in a monetary union where interest rates are matched to the exigencies of the core countries. Interest rates were extraordinarily low during the last decade because of Germany's economic malaise. Peripheral governments like Ireland and Greece should have dampened demand through taxing and spending. Instead they did the opposite. To prevent this problem afflicting the Eurozone again, the core countries want to harmonise a number of economic policies, among them corporation tax. This, however, will have no effect on the current crisis (at least as far as Ireland in concerned) which will most likely require investors in Irish banks to take a hit for investing in reckless institutions.

I'm uncertain about how much sense the harmonisation of a corporate tax base, or tax rates, makes. I know the motives behind them aren't the most rational - in Ireland the 12.5% rate has become a sacred cow and in Germany and France attacking it is a useful way to impress voters angry about bailing out insolvent sovereigns. In reality, Ireland budget problems are totally unrelated to corporation tax (it makes up a greater share of government revenue than the [EU average](http://www.ronanlyons.com/2010/11/16/and-its-hard-to-craft-a-budget-when-youre-watched-by-olli-rehn-open-letter-to-soon-to-be-european-overlords/).) Ireland is also unusual in that its average corporation tax rate (after loopholes and exceptions) is very close to its headline rate (about 11%) In contrast there is a difference of about 25 percentage points between [France's](http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2011/0323/1224292848181.html) average and headline rates. Ireland also lacks easy access to large ports and European transport routes. This makes it heavily reliant on services and high value manufacturing, which are notoriously footloose. In attracting these MNCs Ireland is competing as much with jurisdictions like Switzerland, Israel and Singapore as Germany and France.

Ireland tax rate obviously does bestow it with a competitive advantage, and [some MNCs](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39784907/ns/business-bloomberg_businessweek/) do abuse it, but on the whole I think its a legitimate and necessary economic strategy with benefits for Ireland and the EU.",0,1301765034,null,0,true,0,c1nhl14,t3_ggwgg,t1_c1nhl14,t1_c1ngmv1,1427033389,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

My maternal grandfather comes from a family of well to do farmers that can trace back to the Posen area since the 12 hundreds. They lost all and fled in WWII.  
My maternal grandmother comes from Silesia. Also lost all and fled in WWII.  
My paternal grandfather comes from a family of East Prussian blacksmiths that moved west around 1900 to become chemical workers.  
My paternal grandmother was the daughter of Jewish shopkeepers in Berlin, but also with a more Eastern background, don't know too much about her though, since she died when I was very young.

So what do I think about it? Those are all areas that were at least partially/often predominantly a German speaking population for hundreds of years, in some cases over 1000 years. But those areas also always had an ethnically quite diverse setup that kinda lived side by side pretty successfully. The kings that ruled often had little in common with the culture of the population anyway.  Germans speakers ruled for a time, Polish speakers ruled for a time, Swedes and Russians ruled for a time. And even such a German posterboy as Frederick the Great used French as his primary language.

It's just the rise of national states and nationalism that screwed this up big time for the last two centuries.

* Member of the Council of Europe since 1949.
* Part of NATO since 1952
* [Ankara Agreement](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Ankara_Agreement) in 1963 between Turkey and EEC for accession.
* Part of the European Union Customs Union since 1995.

Of course Turkey will have to change its laws and policies according to [Acquis](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Community_acquis), but this would only strengthen Turkey's long term viability and potential contribution to the EU.

It would also allow the EU to have a border with the Middle East (Syria, Iraq, Iran) as well as a border with Central Asia (Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan). This would increase trade opportunities with these areas and improve European-Islamic relations, not to mention improving living standards in this part of the world and possibly even exporting Turkish secularism to overly Islamic nations.

An exception are most discos, where you get both tables, chair-less bars and no table service, presumably because the owners don't want people to hang out in what's supposed to be a line.

If you sit down at a table, barkeepers usually take it as a hint that you don't want to drown your sorrow in whisky and their semi-compassionate remarks and serve you at the table, yes.

That said, for the continental variety, go to your local bakery, buy some [bread rolls](http://www.nw-news.de/_em_daten/_nw/2010/11/15/101115_1851_broetchen.jpg), and have some [cold cuts](http://www.wurstauswurz.de/uploads/pics/Laden_Aufschnitt_01.jpg), [cheese](http://www.kopiaskaesekiste.de/images/kaeseplatte1_klein.jpg), cream cheese, and jam (Raspberry, Cherry, you name it) at home. Definitely do try [Nutella](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutella) (or similar products) if you like a sweet morning. Add a boiled egg and a cup of fresh coffee, avoid croissants and what the Brits call ""continental breakfast"". I wouldn't go scrambled or fried egg without going British. Try frying some [ham](http://www.serranoschinken.com/images/Serrano%20Schinken%201.jpg) cubes, scrambling two or three eggs on top of it and eating it on a (toasted?) piece of [proper bread](http://www.reesdorfer-hof.de/images/ganzkorn_g1.jpg). A glass of juice won't hurt, as will replacing coffee with tea. Hot chocolate if you like it. That is, have *some* kind of hot beverage, if possible. Helps to settle you down and start the day grounded.

*Do*, however, buy fresh rolls (a little walk on an empty stomach is a very good way to start the day), or, at the very least, buy pre-baked ones and eat em more or less directly out of the oven. They absolutely have to be crisp (hence don't go for croissants (not to mention that they taste like cardboard (and are french))).

If you're confused by the fluff ending up on one side of the roll, stab them in the middle before cutting. This only happens when they're fresh out of the oven.

If you're short on time, just try downing one or two [Malzbier](http://www.germanbeerinstitute.com/Malzbier.html). They will prevent you from starving until lunch.

&gt;key passages restricting the freedom of the press for private publications

There was never an intent to restrict any freedom of press, only that the requirement of registration of publications be extended to the Internet. The biggest internet-only news portals required registration even previously, and presuming that the government intended to require registration from the thousands (if not hundreds-of-thousands) private blogs, is even technically impossible. The funny part in this one, is that the owner of the biggest and loudest left-leaning (currently opposition) internet-only news portal (index.hu) was actually member of the board, who drafted the law. Ain't that a situation, that the same portal then publishes its opinion about how freedom-of-speech limiting the new law is?

Treating the new law with prejudice, voicing opinions without even reading the law, presuming ill-will from the Hungarian government, generalizing the media law criticism to the whole Hungarian political system, attaching derogatory remarks, titling Hungary a ""lesser"" democracy than the rest of Europe, ""Führerstate"", ""Putinism"", has given a chance to the outgoing corrupt political forces to regain in power, and it is all, that the media law hysteria has done to Hungary.

The app unfortunately is just for iPhone now. I don't have enough resources to do both right now. The cool thing is that it will work offline, so no roaming charges. The maps and nearest functions work offline using GPS and open source maps.

Thanks a lot!

That was my thinking too, but ""qualcuno"" is also [a noun with the sense ""important person"" (as in English ""somebody"")](http://www.wordreference.com/iten/qualcuno). The reference here doesn't say that it is invariable. There are also many Google hits for ""qualcuni"" suggesting that it means ""some people"", although these could be mistaken.

As for becoming fluent... It's complicated, because you will probably be hanging out with the erasmus students, with whom you will be talking english. And maybe some or most courses you'll take will be in english.

""crucial for the foundation"", actually the text reads ""nation-preserving role"", it is a reference to Hungary's history. The Hungarian state was first established under St Stephen as a Christian state. Putting in there Judaism, just for sake of ""religious correctness"", is silly. If they'd followed that logic, they would had to properly dismiss Islam, since it (trough the Ottoman Empire) caused 150 years of hardship to Hungary.

This is exactly how most of the people in Hungary feel about religion: ""a tradition"".

true,AK47blues,null,null,"Hi. Army brat here. I grew up over there and I just graduated from an American college. If you've looking into this and talking to your advisor and the possiblity is there, do not hesitate. Like others have said, you will hugely regret passing this up.

Germany is a good choice because it's centrally located in Europe, it makes getting around to the other countries awesome. The key thing here is that it basically doesn't matter how good your German is, because most Germans are half decent at English, even if they think they aren't you can still understand them. If you stay with a family, you will be golden. Most schools will have families that sign up to host you, and they usually have ones with German college students and they will take you by the hand and guide you.

If your advisor tells you it's possible, do it. Worry about the paperwork later. Either way, if he/she gives you the go ahead, I'd say they are responsible for making sure it works out and pack your bags.

When you get thrown into a situation where all you hear is in German, all you read and have to understand and say is in German, your skill of the language will improve exponentially. I really hope you get to go. I grew up in Bavaria, so of course I'm going to say Munich rocks with their cocks out.

I've studied at other German unis (MA and Mainz), and believe me, especially as a foreigner, it's an advantage to **not** be at a huge uni. The German unis work on a different system, but you generally receive very little time or patience at busier schools. Often a prof will only have 1 or 2 office hours per week, and at a bigger school, you'd better be in line 2 hours in advance if you want to talk to the guy. 

That's all different at Eichstätt, where everything is on a smaller scale, and things seem to move slower. And it's not like there's no one there. There are plenty of students, a large international program, a couple bars and places to party on the weekend. 

The OP isn't looking for a prestigious degree; he's looking for the experience of living in Germany, and from my personal experience, I can highly recommend staying away from bigger places, where you are just another anonymous face.

Your timing is great for Barcelona, the weather should be excellent and it's not going to be filled with (other) tourists.

Nothing wrong with that.  Unless you speak fluent Catalan, you will have to deal with being an outsider.

I could list bars, cafés and restaurants, but I'd hate for you to make an effort to go to a specific place and find it either full, disappointing or closed altogether.  For first timers, my very best advice is to walk around, especially in the older parts of town (El Born, Raval, Gothic Quarter) and keep an eye on where you see a lot of locals hang out, and join in.

In Barcelona there are not many tourist-trap restaurants serving shitty food for high prices.  (Unlike in most of the other touristy cities/villages along the coast, although even there it's not that bad)

While people like Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger continued to walk the old libertarian walk, it's been more and more apparent that the FDP would sell any rights they could get their hands upon to satisfy the CDU's regressive politics, then having a party that doesn't move a millimetre from their libertarian position in any case whatsoever, spiced with a grass-roots democracy the Greens would like to have and, while arguably not letting themselves be dragged into class struggle (on either side), has a social conscience makes things, well, problematic.

If you ask Pirates about their goals for the next election, ""More votes than the FDP"" has largely replaced other goals such as ""Finally enough votes to overcome the five-percent minimum"".

I don't have accurate statistics, but, alongside with the Greens and SPD, the FDP is one of the prime sources of defectors now fighting for the Pirates.
