To me, nationalism *can't* work if you look for commonalities, can't work if you want to unify. You have to look for the differences to learn to cherish them, you end up with a much more fine-grained map of different cultures, and, last, but not least, the whole thing isn't based on a superiority complex.

I argue that you could split any group of people into smaller, distinctive subgroups - the British are Welsh, Irish, Scottish and English, who in turn are - besides others - Cornwallish, who in turn split into subtribes. The situation in Bavaria is that even small towns think of themselves as ""different"" than the neighbouring town. 

I don't deny that there are things that seperate us - but argue that there are *more* things that unite us - and thus we *do* have nation-states and ""nation-people"", we do have the British, and yes of course we do have a German nation.

But if we have such a german nation, is it necessarily nationalistic - and even if - is the net return of a small degree of nationalism for the welfare of the united german tribes not worth it? would countries like Schleswig-Holstein - or for that matter Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg - be substainable on their own, or would we fall back into agrarian developing countries, subject to the constant threat of being assimilated into neighbouring nation-states and being stripped of our cultural heritage ourselves?

&gt; nationalism can't work if you look for commonalities, can't work if you want to unify

You unify peoples by either a common cause, a common enemy and/or a common symbol. Excessive nationalism (and we don't have this nowadays) is such a symbol.

I hope my WÃ¼rttemberg gets assimilated into Switzerland as fast as possible (they do have a law to allow this!), not for nationalistic or ethnic considerations, but because I like the swiss way of keeping out of trouble.

Sure, but not having equal chances does not equal having no chances. I stated that in another thread - in my area, we have tons of Turks and Russian Germans.

&gt; You unify peoples by either a common cause, a common enemy and/or a common symbol. Excessive nationalism (and we don't have this nowadays) is such a symbol.

Hmm, I don't think you got my drift completely. I refuse the vadility of projecting a motive or such onto another tribe. I, as a Holstein, don't get to tell Bavarians what being German means, that is. It's not so much excessive nationalism I'm opposing (hell, I'm a seperatist), but the presumptuousness involved in *defining*, instead of *living*, culture. Tradition is the passing of the fire, not praying the ashes, nor pointing at light bulbs. 

The BNP, or, fwiw, also the majority of the English (though presumably in majority not for nutjob reasons but sheer ignorance) seems to like to define for the Scots what being British is supposed to be all about, and the Scots don't seem to be overwhelmingly thrilled by that. So while the NPD and BNP is calling for the glory of their respective cultural constructs, I naturally side with the Scots and their right to self-determination. Same goes for Belgium. I don't mind balkanisation, at all, it's very necessary to relieve tensions and avoid trampling on minorities.

I then paraphrased the adherence thing to plain language for brevity's sake. While you might have *thought* ""the *criminal* Roma"" while writing ""a culture"", the common semantics of English say that you refer to ""The Roma culture"", that is, ""The way all Roma people live"".

&gt; It's that I don't think it has a place in a public school curriculum as a means to somehow help Roma adapt and integrate.

Well, we gotta do it *somewhere*. School is, IMHO, a sensible place. Definitely better, cheaper, and more dignified, than in prisons... not to mention more effective.

&gt; Which is it?

There's ethnic Roma which assimilated into majority society, there's ethnic/cultural Roma who arrange themselves with majority society in a way that makes them quite invisible (unless the clan comes over for a party...), and there are those that have problems doing that for a gazillion of different reasons, one big being fear of becoming the first type. So the idea on which the project in Kiel is based is reconciling both cultures -- and state authority -- so that every single one of them can be type two, albeit more visible. 

What I *hope* we end up with -- and so far it looks good -- is a vibrant Sinti clan cherishing their culture composed of well-educated people being economically successful that become a role-model that other Sinti and Roma and other majority populations want to imitate.

edit:also,obligatory nazi joke:
Three women â a German, a Jew and a polack â all gave birth to seven pound baby boys at the same time. The nurses got the babies mixed up somehow and couldnât tell which baby belonged to which mother.
After an hour of mass confusion the father of the German baby decided he would settle the problem. He walked into the nursery and lined up the three infants in a row. He then clicked his heels, raised his arm in a salute and shouted, âHeil Hitler!â

UnverstÃ¤ndlich aber diese Passage:

&gt; Ein beliebter Trick bei Studien zu Vorsorgeuntersuchungen ist es, statt der Sterberate die Ãberlebensrate etwa nach fÃ¼nf Jahren festzuhalten. 

Aus der Sterberate kann ich die Ãberlebensrate leicht errechnen und umgekehrt, weil sie sich zu 100 Prozent addieren. Was also meint der Autor hier mit ""Sterberate""? Zu einem anderen Zeitpunkt, etwa nach 20 Jahren? Kann man machen und sollte man auch in der FrÃ¼herkennung (meint der Autor wahrscheinlich mit dem unglÃ¼cklich gewÃ¤hlten ""Vorsorge""), aber dann hat man die Erkenntnis eben auch erst eine halbe Generation spÃ¤ter.

Und weiter:

&gt; Weil bei Vorsorge-Screenings auch schon sehr frÃ¼he Krebsformen gefunden werden, die erst Jahre spÃ¤ter Beschwerden verursacht hÃ¤tten, fallen FÃ¼nf- oder Zehn-Jahres-Ãberlebensraten bei diesen Patienten natÃ¼rlich eklatant besser aus als bei jenen, die erst viel spÃ¤ter zum Arzt gehen. Auch dann, wenn die Getesteten trotz FrÃ¼herkennung genauso sicher an der bÃ¶sartigen VerÃ¤nderung sterben.

Dies ist als ""lead-time bias"" bekannt und hat nichts damit zu tun, ob die Sterberate oder die Ãberlebensrate, oder auch nach welcher Zeit bestimmt wird. Das ist im Wesentlichen ein Selbstselektionsproblem (die aus eigenem Antrieb zum Arzt gehen, haben die Beschwerden schon, im Rahmen eines FrÃ¼herkennungsprogramms noch nicht), dem man mit randomisierten Studien zu Leibe rÃ¼cken kann (prominentes Beispiel die [europÃ¤ische Studie zur ProstatakrebsfrÃ¼herkennung](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19297566)). 

Zur TitelÃ¤nderung: Wer sich von der ""Schulmedizin"" daraufhin mit Grausen abwendet und in der KomplementÃ¤rmedizin eine rigorosere Anwendung wissenschaftlicher Prinzipien sucht, kommt vom Regen in die Traufe. Aber das ist nicht das, was die meisten in ""besonderen Therapierichtungen"" suchen und eher das, woran sich die ""Schulmedizin"" messen lassen will.

Already mentioned but we are not that different.  
At first of all, it takes patience.  
I moved to Hamburg for a while and it took me half a year to have at least two or three people I used to see on occasion.  
Getting to know people and make friends takes time.  
Church would be a good possibility, but that's not an option for most of us.  
Other than that: Job, Hobbies and Clubs.  
Frankfurt has a very vibrant electronic music culture, but most people there might be younger than you &amp;#040;and maybe they take a little more drugs than you would like&amp;#041;.  
But there are a lot of bars and life music venues, I know it isn't easy to go out alone, but that's a great way to meet people.  
I managed to get to know a huge amount of people by taking on a second job at a bar here in Stuttgart, one night a week for two years.  
Even if you work as a busboy, you will meet plenty of people our age and a little younger.  
Other than that, sports?  
Maybe a martial art? People there are usually awfully nice.  
There are often free sparring meetups where people hang out and do some sports &amp;#040;hitting each other&amp;#041;.  
You are right about groups though, people here take a little time to open up to new people, but if you make friends you usually make them for life &amp;#040;at least at our age and in my experience&amp;#041;.  
The trick is to use one of the above mentioned activities to break the ice, after that people here in Germany are perfectly nice &amp;#040;well except the usual amount of assholes of course&amp;#041;.

The discussion of the meaning of subculture is irrelevant because, either way, they don't mesh well. Blacks in the USA, as well as New Yorkers, people from LA, and hill people from the South, are all subcultures, but the difference between these cultures and the mainstream culture is much smaller than the difference between Roma and mainstream European culture. In the USA, the subcultures even speak the same language. They all shop at Walmart, drive cars, watch TV, have computers, and enjoy US pro sports. So the analogy to the Roma is weak.

I'd just like to add that if in case reddit was sold by Conde Naste to, say AOL, and the latter messed with the algorithms how the content and product should behave. Then, if we think that made the site biased, then we could simply vote by our feet (or clicks) and move away from the site. The money stream would dry up (as in the case of Digg) for AOL, and this would be highlighting the fact that users are at least partly responsible of success of the site, hence have at least some form of responsibility and ownership (not in terms of money or IP, of course, but in power). This might not be so on sites which just aggregate content to users, but on sites where the content is produced by users to users, this will lead to a effect of hivemind, which is something you, me or really anyone else can neither predict or control.

Btw, have you noticed how little moderation reddit has lately gotten from the admins and wondered why was it so? The site has matured to a stage where users control the site, not the admins (and definitely not Conde Nast for that matter). You wouldn't want to piss off the hivemind, that's why.

To an average Bulgarian, the problem looks like this: there's this minority in your country. You pay taxes (subtracted from a piss poor wage) and your taxes partly go into subsiding this minority. At the same time, it's members of this minority who: beg on the streets, steal, rape, and are the thugs you're worried about when you go out of your house at night. All while they're making everything dirty (or just dirtier) have no respect for for community property, and live in slums like these.

It goes both ways, is what I'm trying to say. It's not just the Bulgarians discriminating against the Gypsies. And, as rospaya said below, it's also a cultural problem. The two ethnicities, if they are to live together peacefully and prosperous within the same country, have to accept their cultural differences, and play off of them. But they don't. They neither trust each other, nor do they want to cooperate. It seems everybody is discontent with the status quo, but no one wants to change it either.

Just so you get a feeling for the cultural differences, this is the first hit when Googling for ""Bride market stara zagora:"" http://svetlanabah.photoshelter.com/gallery/G0000wL5jPAlcYpw

Lot's of people think about close cooperation with Northern Africa, mostly the French.

First of all, don't be too hasty. Last time there was a ""democratic revolution"" in the Muslim world [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/26/world/africa/26iht-iran.html) happened. Let's wait out and see how everything developed. In my opinion, any protest where people gather to pray is nowhere near democracy.

Other than that the region is very different. Some countries there (example: Libya and Tunisia) don't even have roads going between them. They don't even consider that anytime they'd want to have any partnership with the neighbor.

Third point is that this is Africa, and those are some of the economic leaders of Africa and maybe they should work towards the African Union or a North African Union with which the EU can have a more close relationship.

Hey, I'll help you with that: we never did cope quite well with this ""capitalism"" thing that appeared, and have been on a downward spiral for some centuries now. We are not alone in this and much has been written on the subject (cf. Protestantism and Capitalism, expulsion of the Jews and aversion to capitalism, etc, etc). This in itself isn't that bad, but given this we have steadily been an emigration country.

Just add to this the fact that most emigrants from Portugal have traditionally been illiterate (or almost) and you have the scenario set for all sorts of prejudices: our emigration profile is one in which people go to do menial tasks. This is broadly what underpins most prejudices, I would say. Especially since this took place in the XX century. Since this is also hand-in-hand with the ascension of Northern Europe in general I think that the prejudices acquire several different dimensions.

Yes, it annoys me when people appear to make very little effort to, for instance, learn the language. I worked in a supermarket over the summer and every week I would get the same people unable to say anything more than ""bag"" and ""thank you"" coming to my till.

Putting them into 'reservations' is absolute bullshit though. We are not 1800's America and fuck you if you think that's a valid way to treat them. ""Oh, they're not making any effort so we'll just put them into Ghettos until they breed themselves to death"".

I've been living here for close to five years. my protip: take your time finding a flat you like, location- or otherwise, because tÃ¼bingen really can suck balls if you don't.

Get a bike, one that is functional but does not look flashy or expensive. bikes get stolen fast around here.

I'm lucky - also decent salary, with a girlfriend who also earns well, in a place that's generously proportioned (again, we got lucky) in an awesome area.  I have good friends here, a relatively straightforward job, a superb commute (5.5km on foot or bike through the center), I love the food, the shops, etc.

There are two keys, IMHO, to getting on in this city.  The first, is speaking the language.  I speak pretty fluent French.  That helps enormously.  

The second, and I learned this quickly, is to not take them seriously at all.  Just approach everything with a gigantic shit-eating smile, and they'll generally be so taken aback (or think you're insane) that your life will be easier.  Remember also that, on general, everyone's (in the words of a friend) living up each other's asshole, wages are low, prices are high, bureaucracy is stifling, commutes are long.  So the next time someone snaps at you or ""excludes"" you from something (e.g. the art scene -- we live in an area with a ton of galleries, and have had some hipster moron sneer at us when we couldn't get past his skinny ass standing on the sidewalk with our car while coming out of our underground garage) just think to yourself...""lol, you, lol.""

I loathe London with an overwhelming passion.  I hate every instance of what I've observed frequently as English working and management culture, I disdain the falseness (at least a Parisian will be a dick to your face), and it's more crowded and expensive (Parisians get defensive when you say how expensive it is -- ""boot...boot...London eez more expenseeve!"" which should tell you something).

I can't imagine living here permanently, no way, no how, nuh-uh.  Taxes are too high, there's not enough space, etc., but for a few years, it's fantastic.

Re. art, let me know if you want to go hit the Mondrian exhibit at the Pompidou, I've been dying to see that.

_Edit:_ Downsides, as I was reminded again this morning, include way too many cops so I can't run nearly as many red lights in my bike as I want.

You're correct on both points, especially in what you implied in the first: Being a foreigner may help to see the nice side. As a French I tend to see the half-empty glass, this is quite common. Are you English? Your comment on London seems to suggest so. In the end, and sorry in advance for the clichÃ©, this is all a matter of perspective: The English falseness that upsets you, to me is a refreshing old-fashioned politeness. Loved Japan for the same reason: You know it's pure social convention, but oh-so-sweet social convention! (though 6 months later I'd probably want to torture a bunny out of boredom).

Your second point, I think, should be valid anytime, anywhere, but is indeed specially useful in major cities, as a shield against anomie.

lol you should see me on my bike in the morning in summer.  Le LÃ©zard on Etienne Marcel is the hotspot for best viewing, don't tell your girlfriend.

I'm actually half-Swiss, half-American, and when I was in Japan, I saw the cultural politeness (similar with Thais, by the way) as vastly different from what I've experienced from the English in every.  single.  fucking.   job.  And that's a lot of jobs, over 15 years, I'm sorry to say.  I've spent a significant amount of time in the UK for work and visiting friends (whom I love, but wouldn't trust them in a work situation, and sometimes I want to fucking slap them for being such a bunch of whiners).  

I found the Japanese to be much more considerate, and not ""fake"" - and under the politeness, I always felt very well treated, respected, and welcomed, as long as I didn't make the usual gaijin-going-overboard mistake of getting ""too close for comfort"".

&gt; Your second point, I think, should be valid anytime, anywhere

&gt;I agree that immigrants into a country need to work towards integration with the host community, but it's not a simple thing and won't be as long as people fear losing their identity. You're very protective over your being American, so too are these people of their heritage.

I work really hard to make sure my kids speak English, understand our culture, keep in touch with out people in the US. **At home.**  I don't expect the school to teach that to my kids.  What I do expect them to be is tolerant of the fact that I'm a foreigner, that my German isn't perfect and that my kids are ""different"" from the other kids.  I will not tolerate people making generalizations about Americans, or something that has become a problem lately, correct my daughter's English because she's speaking US rather that British English.  When I moved here I thought that it wouldn't be that big of a deal to fit in, US culture is pretty well knows and hey, I thought, not that much different than German.  Wrong.  I'm always walking a line between staying who I am, while accepting where I am. 

We all have a say in what our children are being taught, there are lots of parent organizations, political groups and human rights groups that anyone can become active in, and anyone can become a citizen and vote if they choose.  But they have to learn the language, which I think it fair enough.

* [FrenchPod101](http://www.frenchpod101.com/learn-french.php) : Lots of lessons (at least for the japanese version of their website, but I guess it's the same for this one) in a podcast form, so it's a cool way to learn while you are commuting. Maybe not the fastest way to learn French, though.
* Pimsleur : Audio lessons. Didn't try this one too much, but it seemed quite well made. You have to repeat the words spelled, however, so it's not something I would use in the subway. I believe Assimil also works in the same way.

That's *your* absurd claim, I haven't made it.

One of the reasons Mubarak wants and absolutely has to stay a little longer and ensure an ordinary transition is the fact that religious zealots are waiting around like vultures, ready to snap the perfect moment for them to return Egypt to the dark ages.

10 years, almost certainly not. 20-30 years, probably not. Beyond that? Who knows. But transitioning to an EU defence force will take longer than a decade, both politically and logistically. Probably not a good idea to wait until it's needed before you do it.

If its that the EU Parliament decides whether to engage in military action then its quite easy to imagine that the EU Parliament would decide not to use its forces to defend these non-European territories when France or the UK would want to.

I would say yes. If an EU member state has territory overseas then the obligation should be on the EU to defend that territory be it the Falklands, Martinique or the bit of Cyprus that Greece owns. Yes, there will be a political issue with this, but it is imperative that the EU acts as a unified force when it comes to issues like that.

&gt; Then there's the problems with agreements with other countries. UK gets access to sensitive military technology from the US which France and others aren't permitted access to. Imagine the US trying to decide what technology to permit the EU to have access to when its still expanding to new states. Would it want Turkey to have access to its latest stuff?

This is an issue, but personally I see the EU and US interests diverging over the next century, by the end of which they will probably be competing rather than working together in the same manner they do today.

Internally I can see embassies remaining until laws are unified to the point of making them redundant, how long this would take I couldn't tell you. Externally I can see EU embassies replacing national ones, even if it just begins as combined missions to small nations or buildings which happen to contain multiple missions from EU nations.

Good thing about this it's not over yet and we will see the developments unfold. After some years we will be able to judge. Right now I really think people are getting overly excited about this and not considering the realities of a revolution and a revolution within a muslim country, and the current events in Egypt. It's not only just about the Muslim Brotherhood, as they are called, it's about all the other religious populist who are going to gain now and the current demographic reality in Egypt. Two thirds of the Muslim Egyptians come or live in rural areas and are definitely more conservative and gullible thus ""material"" for an islamistic twist to to the events.

They're in the unfortunately-not-so-unique situation that they are the basis for the current government's majority, so they get to decide a lot of important issues, even though they are in the minority. That means the current government's attempts at economic reform have been accompanied by extreme restrictions on immigration and civil rights of foreign citizens. We currently have the strictest immigration law in all of Europe â of course it's kind of irrelevant, since Sweden and Germany are quite lax in comparison, and there's free movement within the EU, but stillâ¦

There are no radical atheist because if someone is radical it certainly isn't caused by absence of belief in deities.

Back on the Egypt thread, it's going to show its true face in the coming months.

The history of racism in Denmark and Scandinavia is long and complex, and there are huge regional differences in attitude, but the crux of the matter right now is the question: ""Why should my tax kroner go to the welfare of poor people who just got here?""

It's hard to be liberal and not care what your neighbor does, as long as he doesn't impact you, like you describe, when the social system is comprehensive and even invasive. I'm not against a comprehensive social system per se, but combined with latent racism, it's a very dangerous cocktail.

Your friend is correct on the French concept of friendship. There's a big difference in commitment level, between ""amis"", ""potes"", ""potes de potes"", ""connaissances"".

Once I traveled with two californian girls, whom I had met in a airport, for a few days. When we parted they were all like ""this was awesome, we love you, thanks so much, come visit anytime, give news"", while I was all like ""hey thanks for the trip, hope to see you one day"", that is: Much less expressive! Turns that I was the one who sent mails to have news, and they barely answered each time :) This was a bit frustrating, but I've since learned to tone down American displays of attention, before interpreting them. Not dismissing anyone here, to each its own way, and I now find they other way rather enjoyable.

So, all in all, I don't think it's really hard to make French friends, I mean true friends. This is not Helsinki here :) IMO the problem comes rather from the city in itself, but that's just a feeling. However you're correct, not speaking French must be a big handicap. Make a French girlfriend maybe, that helps!

What are those race issues you're talking about? Are you of Asian decent maybe? That'd explain the hassling, Asians have it a bit tougher than others.

A lot of Germans speak English.

&gt; and the German spoken there is not as clear as the one in Essen or Bonn.

Yes in Munich they speak a pretty heavy German dialect which can be hard to understand for people not from Bavaria. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_language

Here is a sketch about it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yWn08Dhv5E
and here is sketch in Bavarian language as another example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsFTo1YONFk

The German in Essen and Bonn is much clearer and closer to Hochdeutsch. The ""dialect"" in Essen is Ruhrdeutsch http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhr#Language But they are very close to Hochdeutsch and most people don't speak real Ruhrdeutsch anymore. The local dialect in Bonn is http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%B6nnsch .

&gt; I am an Arab btw (not sure if that matters anyway).

It's probably not a problem. Depending on the city there are a lot of Turkish and Arab people anyway. e.g. Berlin and I think Essen too have a large Lebanese community. Of course if you are a practising Muslim and don't drink alcohol and don't eat pig meat then you might not get the full German experience. But it won't be a problem.

&gt; Is living with a family a good idea?

Yes. You'll be forced to speak German and they'll probably do some culture stuff with you.
