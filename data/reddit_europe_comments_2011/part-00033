That's the whole point,yes; higher taxes mean higher prices which means lower demand. The carbon emissions create a negative externality which is not currently part of its price, and hence the product is over-consumed. That's how all [Pigovian taxes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax) work. The revenue from this tax, if it is high enough, is supposed to be sufficient to offset that externality, or some other taxes to less damaging practices can be lowered.

Fuel taxes are indeed similar but the taxation base is slightly different; for quantity of a fuel is not exactly the same thing as its co2 emissions, for different fuels can be better or worse in this regard.

A current biometric passport photo. (Eyes completely open, not smiling, hair out of the face)

Rent/lease contract or home sale contract. This must include the number of square meters of living space. 

Proof of the monthly cost of the home/apartment. You either need to bring proof of a withdrawal from your account or a mortgage contract showing the monthly payment. As long as it proves how much you're paying per month you're fine. 

Proof of adequate knowledge of the German language. (Level B1 or equivalent)

Additionally: 
If you were educated in Germany: 
proof of a recognized German university/college diploma, or proof of a three year apprenticeship. 

If you were not educated in Germany: 
Proof of a qualifying apprenticeship outside of Germany
AND
A letter from your previous employer (or employers) about the type and length of time of your employment, proving that you've worked for at least three years in an industry, and that this employment qualifies as an apprenticeship. 

OR

Proof of a diploma from a German university/college or from a comparable foreign institution. 
AND 
A letter from your previous employer describing the type and length of your employment. This needs to prove that you've worked in the field for at least 2 years. 

This list is not exclusive (there's a better word to put here, but I can't think of it).

Bullshit. The ""cit√©s"" (French schemes) are there, yes, but they're just one (small) part of what France is. Their importance on the political stage is due to the media (especially TF1) showing those places in a negative light, blaming the people there for all the crime, under a veil of barely masked racism.

They are underprivileged, underfunded, immigrant and working class with high unemployment rates, and pretty much abandoned by the state with the exception of education and heavily armed police who go in and kick the asses of small time dealers.

Nonetheless, schools there are still free - and uni in France is still almost free - and French universities are full of people from schemes all over the country, many of whom are friends of mine.

Not only that, the article you referenced, to which you didn't even bother to provide a link, is in a language OP probably doesn't understand, while the main quote you were aiming for to back your badly made point up is available in its English original.

That said, the Treaty of Versailles actually was one of several contributing factors that helped to make it possible for the Nazis to come to power, and I've never said otherwise.

Unless you have a job already lined up, it might prove difficult to move to Paris for more than the duration of an extended vacation.

My point was that for the same type of work I did in Greece for ¬£14k I did in the UK for about ¬£35k with no change in  my productivity.  The amount I am paid does not have much to do with how productive I am.

Alexander is a very Greek name.  Alexander was Greek, from his mothers side.     (Although the Albanians are claiming that she was Albanian.)   And even if  Macedonia was separate, Alexander embraced the Hellenic culture, and incorporated his empire as Hellenic.

 But maybe you  can  explain how the slavs can suddenly claim the right to be macedonian when they have no continuity, when they did not embrace the macedonian culture or language.  They rejected it.  There is no continuity.

I can see the criticism here being reasonable; still I disagree with both your points; the decision for this extension of Residence Palace was made in 2004, since it was decided all Summits will be held in Brussels, and Council and the European Council have had a lack of space since. I think the contractor was chosen in 05, I presume it's been build ever since. With Lisbon Treaty this is only more pressing with a permanent president and European Council becoming an official EU institution.

Re budgetary expansion, agreed that the timing is unfortunate, but this is a reasonable consequence given that EU has expanded its role and institutions with the Lisbon Treaty and things like the EEAS need funding too . As it stands, trans-european networks funding has been butchered in 11, and such infrastructural investment are a terrible shame to loose. Both offer options for net savings in domestic expenditures across countries by pooling resources.

Also, the increase asked is 4.9% after the negotiation (I'm not sure if it ever was 5.8%, though that is the increase EEAS part of the budget will get, as baroness Ashton demanded), and the fight is now for a 5% increase in the multi-annual 2014-2020 budget, a timeframe that isn't impacted by current recession, so the argument from austerity today makes little sense. Less is impossible anyway simply by counting the costs of measures states have already accepted. But I guess instigating eu-hate brings Cameron votes.

""We already agreed you would give us more money""

&gt;Less is impossible anyway simply by counting the costs of measures states have already accepted.

""We are used to getting more money""

There is this sort of common base assumption that you make. That the money the EU 'needs' / 'negotiates' or is accustomed to, is in any relationship with the costs.

I'm pretty sure it is very well possible to use the budget from 10 years ago, to take of the responsibilities of today.

Like the ""good"" national governments, they need to do more for less. 

&gt;But I guess instigating eu-hate brings Cameron votes.

I think he just tries to represent his people, who will likely feel that way as well. This is not just 'populism' .. this is exactly what democracy is supposed to be doing.

&gt;till I disagree with both your points; the decision for this extension of Residence Palace was made in 2004, since it was decided all Summits will be held in Brussels, and Council and the European Council have had a lack of space since.

This is the part of your argument where I agree with you. That in general, things take time and we can't consistently come back on decisions because the winds suddenly blows in another direction.

There needs to be continuitiy. But the EU costs too much money for what it wants to do. And when you have something like this, which does send a very weird message, then you need to be able to list a bunch of stuff you are going to do, to cut operating costs.

Because in the end of the day, they really do need to realize it's the people's money, and symbolism matters.

This building is not just expensive, more importantly, it's more expensive than it needs to be, and it visually screams that message.

This is not a government building of humble servants to the people. It's a King's palace. 

Things they could have done, includes scaling the project back. Give it a more boring look. 

&gt;oh, and are you sure national budgets, in sum, are actually shrinking? I gather 23 of 27 national budgets increased in 2011, and 24 are to increase in 2012

In a number of countries the people and the government have all decided that we need to cut spending and do the responsible thing. 

These countries are the main ones that are now expected to pay up for Greece, Portugal, etc.

The fact that there are many southern-european countries that aren't cutting spending and risking our shared currency can't possibly be an excuse for the EU to this financially irresponsible, nor to disgard the symbolism of their spending choices.

You are right, that it's easy for any government to point the blame to the EU. But it really shouldn't be that easy.

It's almost as if they don't really care what we think of their legitimacy.

&gt;Like the ""good"" national governments, they need to do more for less.

EU is vastly more financially disciplined than any government; it can't do debt, its spending is tightly constrained, part by part, and in terms of backloading and flexibility wiggle room etc by the multiannual framework; its budget grew by 37% in the last decade, while the national budgets grew by 62%. Given that it doesn't have much slack during boom periods to mushroom the budget, and the rigidity of its obligations and decision process, its quite logical it cannot cut back significantly from established plans due to a recession.

&gt;That the money the EU 'needs' / 'negotiates' or is accustomed to, is in any relationship with the costs.

it is in an 1 to 1 correspondence with the cost, since it cannot go into debt. 96% of the budget is for specific projects, in Member States, and 80% is for projects selected and decided on by member states; only 6% is for administration (half of this for wages), and the entire budget is just ~1% of the GDP. And the administration costs are frozen in this period (for a couple of years now), as have been the staff numbers.

So it 'needs' the money to the extent member states don't want to cut any programmes they have chosen to finance. Ofc its possible to abolish some programmes, but in that case :

&gt;I'm pretty sure it is very well possible to use the budget from 10 years ago, to take of the responsibilities of today.

well, that isn't, for it necessarily entails dumping some of the responsibilities it has today (not necessarily a bad thing; I'd like to see CAP payments lowered, as would the parliament; but that's not the opinion of a sufficient number of states). Ofc various underperforming programmes were indeed cut in the current budget proposal.

&gt;The fact that there are many southern-european countries that aren't cutting spending and risking our shared currency can't possibly be an excuse for the EU to this financially irresponsible

Well how many southern-european countries do you think there are? In any case if anyone is cutting spending now, it will be those countries that have a debt crisis on their hands, since they're in a prolonged recession, yet trying to close the deficits, so revenues drop. No, most of Europe is back in positive territory now (as are revenues), and expenditures and deficits rose in recession automatically for say benefits etc, so mere fact a government was trying to cut back didn't necessarily mean the mass of the budget decreased; lot of the cuts were also just closing the deficit gap to catch up with the expenditures that the EU couldn't even have in the first place...

&gt;But the EU costs too much money for what it wants to do

you base this on what?

&gt;This is not a government building of humble servants to the people. It's a King's palace.

that is a good point; first glance, it looks extravagant. We should have some idea as to how its cost (given its an extension of an existing building) actually compares with other major seats to really judge though.

&gt;Things they could have done, includes scaling the project back. Give it a more boring look.

maybe, I really don't know how the project was initially chosen in 05, nor how much was there left to be done the year before its completion, to effect its boringness.

You are obviously much more knowledgeable than I am, about the actual numbers. So anything other than just assuming you are right about this would be silly.

I do want to point out, that I don't have any issue with 'high wages'. If anything, that can actually help prevent corruption.

&gt;96% of the budget is for specific projects, in Member States, and 80% is for projects selected and decided on by member states

But how much of that money is spend in Brussel? On food, travel and other expenses? And is what is paid for those expenses, is that truly market-conform or do these guys pay more for products &amp; services that they personally befriend or are being lobbied by. Why is it so safe for me to assume they pay more than 10,000 euro's for developping a communication website about a topic that isn't visited by more than 100 people a month?

Many types of economic transactions are considered 'corruption' by the people, that aren't technically illegal. In the healthy democracies such type of politicians are usually called out, shamed and voted out of office. 

But Europe isn't a very healthy democracy at all. We tend to vote about Europe in a more national way. And the people in Brussel don't really take notice of how we feel.

Doing something differently than what any generic poll in Europe would tell you the people want, is the type of choice that is consistently made too lightly.

&gt;&gt;I think he just tries to represent his people, who will likely feel that way as well.

&gt;Saddest thing is, you may well be right here...

But that isn't a sad thing. They aren't trying to make us feel differently about Brussel. People care about the symbolism of things, because it speaks volumes about loyalty and respect.

The extravagent building will generally be seen as a big FU by most people in the EU. And the numbers really don't matter that much. The fact that any idiot could have predicted this reaction .. suggest they know we hate it, and they don't care.

And that's the problem. Brussel should care about how we feel about these things. They are the extensions of a very complicated political system that depends on the goodwill of the people.

The Brussel clan should be _submissive_ rather than _right_.
It's our money, our democracy, our needs and our mistakes to make.
Why is it so easy to build an extravagent looking building? And so hard to put net-neutrality in EU law?

The cause isn't just Brussel. It's the lack of proper media attention. It's the lack of a strong European justice system that deals with corruption. You really can't blame the people for not trusting the EU, if it takes 7 years for us to discover what we appearantly agreed to. Sure, most media attention is generally negative. But unlike local politics, negative attention doesn't translate to a change in policy. It's not like the EU is giving informative interviews to the negative media outlets. It's not that they take it in consideration when making decisions.

And this may be par for the course, for certain democracies in Europe. But not for all. And in some democracies, if the people are pissed, you get on your knees and you say sorry and you try to explain your choices. You are right, that we agreed to it. But have you not noticed the fact that most people are strongly considering voting for anti-EU parties? If they don't listen to the people _now_, and keep telling them _this is what you voted for, this is what you agreed to_. They will vote differently next time. They will stop agreeing.

This all or nothing mentality is nothing more than an extorion. A proper political system adapts to the priorities and concerns of the people, in between elections as well.",0,1309097933,null,0,true,0,c21zace,t3_i961f,t1_c21zace,t1_c21z383,1427286304,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Some of this is being corrected, some is tied up in contentious proposals of the most federalist MEPs. Looks to me a bit like crossing the uncanny valley; too powerful to just holds governments individually responsible effectively, yet not powerful enough to be a true (con)federal political sphere for itself.

Though to be fair, I did hear most of the arguments re the current budget and the multiannual framework, criticism and justification, fairly clearly on euronews, initially.

&gt;But how much of that money is spend in Brussel? On food, travel and other expenses? And is what is paid for those expenses, is that truly market-conform 

I'd strongly expect such costs to be part of the 6%; I can't see where else it could fit; its neither fisheries nor rural development (11,1% budget), nor direct agri payments (30.2%) , nor territorial cohesion (ie projects in less developed regions , 36% ), nor research, social cohesion or trans-european networks (9.5%), nor foreign relations (6.2%), nor border control, police cooperation etc (.8%), nor consumer protection, public health, culture, youth etc (.5%). All of these are marked for specific projects, and a Council of Auditors needs to verify they were spent accordingly, and yes in compatibility with say state aid rules, and public procurement rules you mention and a host of other (so examples you give definitely are illegal). As I said, on most of this, the money isn't even in the hands of the institutions to spend or decide about, but decided on by individual states (that's how 'net contributions' can even be calculated, which is crucial for say the UK rebate calculation). Not everything ends up deemed regular (just 95%), esp in cohesion policy(11%!), though even then, its mostly bureaucratic mistakes. I'm not sure which mechanisms of control could exist that aren't implemented. You mentioned corruption; I don't see on what facts this is based on; out of hundreds of transactions annually, at worst a couple provide grounds for anti-fraud investigations (in which cases, the money is recovered).

&gt;Sure, most media attention is generally negative. But unlike local politics, negative attention doesn't translate to a change in policy

Well, an extreme amount of media attention in certain states is either simply fabricated or tortuously constructed from actual facts, and EU is more than the couple extremely eurohating countries, for the policy to conform merely to these. I don't see there is much that can be done on the EU lvl for UK for eg.; it will simply take a decent commitment of local politics if they desire to continue their membership (or they can just leave). That said, given how easy it is to say one thing in Brussels and than claim something  different domestically to avoid responsibility, EU definitely should seek more direct contact with the citizens, at a grater pace than this is currently expanding. What I don't understand is how ppl can buy this type of tale so easily, given that pretty much every decision needs a majority vote of the governments to happen .",0,1309103721,null,0,true,0,c21znph,t3_i961f,t1_c21znph,t1_c21zace,1427286480,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Its a whole subject in itself and it takes people a whole lifetime to understand it. How far are you in.The grand mufti in Egypt has the knowledge, how far are you in to that study. I suspect your interpretations hold no value whatsoever because you dont have a knowledgeable basis to work from.

As for it being a just set of ideas, thats a complete nonsense. Its their whole guide to life, and it was not written to be interpreted literally. Its a very complex book and a very complex religion. 

Muslims in Europe either have a right to be religious or they dont, but if they can't nobody should have the right, no more jews, christians, hindus or sikhs.

Its unfair and actually cruel to condemn sections of your society who live normal lives, work hard and live within the rules of your society. People should be able  to live their lives peacefully and without constantly being under attack. Attacking islam is personally attacking muslims. Singling them out and isolating them is what Hitler did to the jews in Germany. Its what the buddhists did to the hindus in sri lanka. Its never an OK or an acceptable thing to do. From my own experience, Ive found countries that are made up of religious people to be warmer and more friendly, happier.

If your solution is to persecute religion out of society, then you're repeating the mistakes of the past. Its never ever ever worked, and its been tried thousands of times, causing millions of deaths. You cannot force people to not be religious, thats tyranny, a form of fascism. Your views are fascist. If youve got a right to think freely, so have they, and they can choose to live their lives how they like, if they choose to change how their religion functions that is their call.

Yes, there's a street in Paris that's closed off every week for a couple of hours, so muslims can pray. The neighbourhood mosque is very small and cannot host so many people, so the remaining has to pray in the street. The Pr√©fecture and the Mairie d'Arrondissement are turning a blind eye and allowing the practice because of the lack of proper infrastructure, and right now there's a prayer center that's being built a few streets away, that will be able to host the neighbourhood muslims (not a mosque, more like the ground zero islamic center, with rooms for associations and such)

So No, there's no invasion. Some people (mainly associated with a right wing ""french identity"" stance or a borader ""republican secular"" point of view) fear it's a demonstration of strength for muslims who pray in the street, but it's not.

true,BusHeckler,EURO,European Union,"I personally would like this very much, but I don't think the US model is a particularly good model; you would need some way of ensuring that nations as they exist now kept their identity to make it a politically viable institution.

I think the leap to a state-like structure, but something tailored to what Europe needs not what different political factions would like, is not far removed from the current EU structure. The problem is that it is pretty higgledypiggeldy. 

For example, the EU parliament elections are held on different days depending on what country you're in. It would make more sense and seem more unified if the elections were all on the same day all over Europe.  The EU parliament needs to promote itself better, particularly in the press, it needs to provide visible leadership to make itself seem viable.

Above all, I think the EU missed a trick when it stopped short of creating the Presidency of the European Council a publicly elected role. Dissatisfaction in Europe cannot be addressed when the citizens of Europe cannot vote for the leader, and the leader isn't actually elected in any sense, it's just a general concensus of heads of state.

The EU is only in its adolescence. Since the Lisbon Treaty was ratified, and Ashton was appointed High Representative, common foreign relations are beginning to become a reality. Such a shame she didn't make any announcements about the Arab Spring, and left that to NATO.

On NATO, and more broadly the integration of military forces, I don't think that this is far along enough to be viable for a while. If there was more co-operation and sharing of troops and equipment between states first, then it may become a reality.

It's even worse than that. The way MEP are elected is chosen by their home country. And since we don't have pan-european parties (and elections) what incentive do they have beyond representing their home countries ? The only reason the European Parliament is currently working and useful is because it's still mostly full of honest politicians. I mean, being a MEP hasn't helped anybody become president or prime minister.

&gt; Above all, I think the EU missed a trick when it stopped short of creating the Presidency of the European Council a publicly elected role. Dissatisfaction in Europe cannot be addressed when the citizens of Europe cannot vote for the leader, and the leader isn't actually elected in any sense, it's just a general concensus of heads of state.

You want the president of the embryo of the European Senate to be elected by universal suffrage ? As if governments weren't powerful enough in the european institutions.

It's too expensive and not much fun, except if you like spending time with a bunch of other tourists. Caf√© Florian is interesting for its history and interior, not for its terras and the musicians. You might as well buy a bottle of wine, take a few glasses from your kitchen and sit on the steps at San Marco (if that's where you really want to be). You will still hear the music ;)


My favorite square is Campo San Margherita, there are ('were' at least, it's been 8 years) nice bars there. 


When in Rome, do as the Romans: the typical drink in Venice is the ""Spritz"", it comes in several flavors: Aperol, Campari ('spritz bitter'), Select and Cynar. It's basically one of those liquors with mineral water (natural or carbonated) and prosecco. 


If you want to ride in a gondola and are not prepared to shell out 80‚Ç¨ (or more, dunno the exact prices, I've never done it) you should look for the 'traghetto', it's a ferry service (usually for generations run by the same family) to get you across the grand canal where there is no bridge. It's much shorter than a real gondola ride of course, but also 80 times cheaper. If you insist on a gondola ride, I'd say go by dusk... and maybe smaller canals. Pay attention to the backs of the houses (coming out on the water) since Venetian houses typically have 2 front doors, one on the street and one on the water, often the fanciest side of the house is on the water side. 

All in all, do some reading up on its history... 

...and if you stay for long enough, consider a 'venice card', it comes in different flavors, with/without museums, but if you get the one with museums included, you'll get reduced rates at e.g. the Biennale, you can ride all the vaporetto's you can take (also the boats to Murano and Burano), some museums are free, and last but not least: you get to skip the mile long lines of tourists and go right in!!

In Germany we (or say: most people, especially the not-very-young generation) are also really sensitive to comments (even joking or mocking) concering Hitler or the Nazis as such.

Exception to that is, by the way, whenever the German Soccer Team is playing (e.g. World Cup). Then it is totally okay to show flag and be proud of the country (one of the huge things I like about these kind of events, you can show flag and celebrate your country with other people openly and don't feel like a bad person).

So you should refrain from showing symbols such as an eagle (yes.. it sounds ridiculous), or if you do, wear it with a bright T-Shirt and not a black one (I am assuming your shirt was dark?).
So, don't think badly of us. It's kinda system inherent since we are educated to think like that.


Imho it's two sides of a coin: For once it's good to not forget such a past, but on the other side it's also so deeply nested within our consciousness that we are taking things far too seriously.
For example: If I am just doodling on a piece of paper and my abstract lines and squiggles are even remotely beginning to look like [Swastika](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika) I just **have** to overdraw it so no one notices and thinks ""omg he is drawing a hakenkreuz - what a nazi!"" (Yes, it is that bad).

(To explain that a bit further: I am not especially paranoid or have any abnormal psychological problems. It's just the way we are brought up think.
I recently had that topic coming up as I was talking with some of my friends and, to my surprise, they said it was exactly the same for them.)


Hope I could explain this whole subject to you a bit, it's still 8am over here *yawns*


**tl;dr** We Germans are educated to be really sensitive about that kind of stuff, so just be careful / aware about your clothing / small talk choices. Don't think badly of us because of it.

But there are a few additional elements. Depending on which kind of eagle was on your shirt (the current Bundesadler or the old Reichsadler) might make a big difference. Further the way of writing, certain styles are simply associated with Nazi propaganda and especially the SS. Lastly I guess your general appearance will be relevant: Do you have very short hair/a bald head and were maybe wearing heavy leather/military boots?

Obviously none of these things make you a Nazi but in the Neonazi-subculture these are common symbols (also: never wear Lonsdale - lo-NSDA-le - clothes). Generally military-esque attire is frowned upon too - even soldiers usually don't wear their uniform during their spare time.

Why all of that? Well, for once because there is a history and modern Germany essentially is the opposite of what the German Reich was in its way of thinking. E.g. it is still not easy to criticise Israeli actions without being suspected as an antisemite (although there are many many good reasons to criticise current Israeli actions...). Or patriotism is more of an insult than a compliment, contrary to most countries (which I completely agree with since what is described as patriotism is usually blindly and unquestioningly risking your and other's lives for decisions made from above - such a thing can only have devastating effects...).

Lastly, don't take it too seriously. These were to random girls walking past and you don't know what subculture they are in or which event they came from. E.g. if they are somewhere on the political far left it is quite a common thing to see any kind of nationalism as Nazi-ism and express it openly. On the other hand maybe they were just two random not-too-smart teenage girls who confuse showing a flag with being racist and fascist.

&gt;can the people speak there a fluent enlgish , like a native one?

since its been 20yrs or less English has had such treatment (and on second thought I'm not sure if its so treated in all stripes of schools actually), definitely not among older ppl (my mum learned just Russian for eg, and briefly). 

Among younger, well not anything like a native language generally, but they manage to communicate fairly decently, say, w tourists, or online. A book in English though would present some challenges to many. 

Fact TV is subbed rather than dubbed probably has a lot to do w it, perhaps more than formal education; that's one other measure I hope countries would  take, on public TV, along w more european films etc, to promote multilingualism (and just better films :P)

I don't think that many ppl are near-native fluent in any second language they may to some extent know.

&gt;I do not think it's fair give enormous importance to the anglo-saxon press, the anglo-saxon ideas and the anglo world above the rest of the european press, for example.

well, I haven't really seen anglo-saxon press on newsstands here; Its more a matter of dominance of anglo-saxon popular culture, and simple network effects of many europeans from various countries knowing English. 

I agree with you, more multilingualism should be promoted, not just English-lang monoculture. But there are currently pragmatic benefits for ppl to know English alongside any other languages they might know; I'd acknowledge this fact for mere economic benefits, as long as it is a fact that is. If more ppl knew say German or Spanish, I'd expect they'd choose to use it in their trans-national communications fairly frequently.

Just to be clear; I'm not saying English should be an obligatory second language as in my description of the domestic situation; I'm just expecting it would be widely freely chosen as such.

I am glad that I'm German, yes. I'd rather live here than, say, a third-world country or a dictatorship. But I see nothing to be ""proud"" of as a *German*. Without the intervention of foreign armies during WW2, Germany would not be a democratic state. 

Our democracy is the result of millions upon millions of brutally murdered civilians. Some people say as Germans, we should be proud of great thinkers and inventors who happened to be German. I did nothing to make these thinkers and inventors who they are. Why would I be *proud* of them? Do I respect them? Like them? Look up to them? Yes. But I don't see how my parents living here and happening to giving birth to me should make me respect them any more than, say, American inventors and thinkers.

Being *proud* of Germany means ignoring Auschwitz. Nazi Germany wasn't ""Hiter-Deutschland"". The whole nation (with few exceptions) ignored, supported or took part in the discriminations, the boycotts, and the mass murders. 

Also, it is not true that Germans have lost their national pride or racist beliefs. According to a [study](http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/do/07504.pdf) (pdf, german) by the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung...

* 34,3% of all Germans think that ""The foreigners only come here to exploit the social state

* 23,6 % think that ""What Germany now needs is one single, powerful Party that represents the whole ""Volksgemeinschaft"". The word ""Volksgemeinschaft"" means ""People's community"" when translated literally. It describes the people as defined by ethic or racial factors.

* 17,2 % believe that ""Jews still have too much influence""

* 14,3 % believe that ""Jews are more likely to use dirty tricks that others to enforce their interests""

* 13,3 % believe that ""Germans are superior to other people by nature""  (22% agree in parts)

given that you're equivocating 'leader' and 'authority' so that you're first speaking of human tendency for some to stand out and others to follow them, but then switch to seeing them as power to issue commands (a ruler) to establish these too must exist in every society, seems like a perfectly reasonable use of the term 'straw man'.

It's just a bit difficult to find their contact information on the net as the agency doesn't like them advertising as an independent while they are current employed by the agency.  I have had some great tour guides this way and actually made some good friends who I have met up with on subsequent trips.

You can usually vet them through Tripadvisor as well if you cannot find them on their agency's website so I'm not worried.

D'apr√®s la communication de la HADOPI, les seconds avertissements, par lettre recommand√©e avec avis de r√©ception, ont d√©but√©. Les premi√®res coupures arriveraient pour la fin 2011, soit en pleine p√©riode √©lectorale... Mais avec les premi√®res condamnations, on aura surtout droit √† une QPC (si c'est possible) et bien plus tard √† un recours devant la CEDH. 
Pour finir, on a eu la rumeur de la fusion ARCEP, CSA et HADOPI, qui me parait bien plus inqui√©tante que la coupure de quelques fans des Bronz√©s ou de Dany Boon.

Auf des Herren Ro√ü sich geschwungen frank.

Und als er sprengen will √ºber die Br√ºck',
Da stutzet das Ro√ü und b√§umt sich zur√ºck.

Und als er die g√ºld'nen Sporen ihm gab,
Da schleudert's ihn wild in den Strom hinab.

Mit Arm, mit Fu√ü er rudert und ringt,
Der schwere Panzer ihn niederzwingt.
