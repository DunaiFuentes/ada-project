Germany uses GSM mobile phones that operate on the 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz bands. Depending on where the OP lives, he might not have a cellular phone that uses these standards. 

Depending on how much you want to utilize your mobile phone in Germany, it might be cheaper to just buy a prepaid phone (which are about 1 € including 1 € of deposit. D1 XTRA and D2 CallYA come to mind, if you are more in the urban areas. Rates depend on the prepaid plan, but are very affordable.

The best case scenario would be PSG, OL, OM making the CL because OL and OM have teams built for Europe, and PSG *CAN* spend if the need arises though as we know they are typically not spenders. 

I like seeing Lille and Rennes at the top because its nice to see new blood up there - but Bordeaux's win certainly did them no favors with long term stability - if anything it caused the EPL to buy some of their talent, inflate the egos of others, and the team has returned to a mid-table finish.

It behooves Ligue 1 teams to send teams to Europe that have a chance to compete, and unfortunately Lille and Rennes don't seem like those teams to be now - and even if they go to Europe, they don't have the capital or local markets to support the kind of spending that competing in Europe requires.

I posted the following info in a different thread, but maybe you can use some of this information when you are there.  

I grew up in Do and went to uni there. So if you have any questions, ask away.

Things to do: For drinks and bars find the Kreuzviertel. Lots of good bars and pubs. There is also a good little club there: Silent Sinners. Also for clubbing and concerts: FZW near the Hauptbahnhof. They have good concerts and clubnights. (The audience for some of the clubnights is a littel older, though.)  If you like it rough an dirty, go to the Spirit. It is a club owned by the local biker gang. Better after 2 or 3 am, best very drunk !

Dortmund brews its own mircobrew: Hövels. Go out for a traditional German food and beer night in the Hövelsbrauerei. Maybe after you saw a play in the theatre. The ""Studiobühne"" in the ""Schauspielhaus"" has pretty good experimental stuff going on and tickets are half off for students (bring your student ID).

Do you like climbing? Dortmund has the best climbing hall of the whole Ruhrpott (that is what we call the Ruhrgebiet). It is on the outskrits, but well worth it (www.kletterhalle-bergewerk.de).

In the summer: Rombergpark and Westfalenpark for some great walks. For some beer drinking (and other things) at night: West Park

The Nordstadt may look a little rough at the beginning, but you will find some very good ethnic food there and some cool bars, too. In the summer, there is even a beach bar in the (industrial) harbor.

For getting away I would recommend the nearby lakes (Möhne, Sorpe, etc.) All the other surrounding towns have cool stuff. Bochum for example also has a very cool bar scene. You can travel for free with your Stundtenticket in all of NRW. Make use of it. But do not even try to understand the train system, just ask other people to help you.

For being up to date, get a Coolibri magazine at the beginning of the month. You will find it in most bars to take for free. It will give you info on the best things to do in town.

Have fun in Dortmund. It is a great place. At the beginning you might think that it is ugly, since a lot of its pretty parts were destroyed in WWII and rebuilt in the 50s and 60s. But be assured, it has a lot of pretty places, is very diverse, has a lot of ""underground"" culture. The people are a little rough in the beginning, but have a ""soft heart under a rough shell"". (That's a German saying: Harte Schale, weicher Kern.)

If you meet Prof. Walter Grünzweig (which I am sure you will): He is awesome.
