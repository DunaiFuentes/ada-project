But it does not end there: the cake was discovered because the investment firm ""MF Global"" entered a loop where financial transactions remortgaging customer funds without the knowledge of these, up to 4 times (ie, counting only backed ""real"" for 25% of leveraged financial bets made), and it seems that now ""MF Global"" has blown up or it's at risk of blowing up and clients (institutional investment funds, pension funds, etc.) have found that their money is gone and is irretrievable.

The mechanism appears to be: the City of London does not regulate remortgaging nor does have a limit on investment funds, which it is done in Wall Street, and then the matrix of ""MF Global"" on Wall Street transferred funds to its U.S. customers branch in the City of London to operate without restriction.

That is, it has allowed the generation of unprecedented systemic risk (socializing losses) to obtain private succulent benefits. In fact, investment firms as ""MF Global"" have encouraged the generation of systemic risk to maximize profitability of their ""investments"" based on financial engineering ""repurchase agreements"", ""rehypothecation"" creatively using financial deregulation of the City, and playing in the casino with the money of its customers without their actual knowledge.

No, giving him a CD wouldn't do any harm by itself. Neither would a bottle of wine from a vineyard near some other colleague's home town, or a couple of cookies yet another colleague had baked. But it's a slippery slope and if all of those came together, suddenly it would become an acceptable thing to do, some career minded idiots would start gifting things, and even if you disregard corruption issues it would still put pressure on other colleagues to follow this apparent new social norm of coming up with present for colleagues, and frankly I wouldn't want that if I was one of them.

A similar line of thinking applies to the professor in question. If he doesn't reject your or some other entirely harmless present, rejecting some brown-noser's present that is actually and obviously intended to gain favors would become much more difficult, because it would be interpreted to be a statement of favoritism by the professor towards you by the person in question.

The agreement that is there now, isn't something the UK would hate, and especially Cameron. It requires governments within the EU to not lend too much money, and make sure the finances are in order. Isn't this what Cameron ran for? 

So, the UK didn't vote against this agreement because they didn't like it. **I think they tried to earmark the agreement**. Essentially black mailing the euro nations into giving the UK whatever the hell it wants, on every other topic.

Bach wrote pieces for Lautenwerk which is a keyboard instrument specifically designed to sound like a lute (could be an argument also for synthie-keyboard actually, as well), so lute is the ""way it is meant to sound,"" and the pieces are playable on lute (the precursor to the guitar) and guitar. Bach also traveled to Dresden to hear the lutenist Sylvius Leopold Weiss, to hear his playing and music. Also David Kellner was a big lutenist at the time whose music survives today. There is an extant sonata for guitar that has been linked to Beethoven, although nothing is proven, so we can't say about that one. Beethoven was acquainted with the guitar virtuoso Mauro Giuliani who played cello in an all-star premiere of one of his symphonies (I think the 7th). He was also reported to have called the guitar, ""a miniature orchestra."" Schubert played and often composed on, though not for, the guitar. 

The guitar is a traditional German instrument but not one that was suitable for playing in concert halls at the time due to the limitation in dynamic range. It wasn't suited for the bombastic forces of the Romantic era, so of course composers like Wagner weren't interested.

The BBC picked the one single way of calculating this that puts the UK on spot no 2.

We have had multiple governments, both left and right wing, tell Europe that we thought the Euro was a bad idea. It looks like we were right - it *was* a bad idea. Why would we share a risk in something we opposed from the very beginning?

Cameron didn't propose increasing and imposing a greater maximum on the Euro-states, he simply proposed that the UK should be able to extend the maximum regulated bank capital reserves for themselves as an EU member outside the Euro.

On a related tangent to the original point of people bashing Cameron for the sake of bashing Cameron and being in bed with the rich and the bankers, everybody should remember the 31st G8 summit at GlenEagles, even if not for the reason it deserved.

Before everybody jumps on the Cameron protecting 'the bankers and the rich' bandwagon, remember this:  France, Italy and Germany have failed to meet their aid obligations under the 31st G8 conference, and Britain went to the recent EU financial treaty meeting with a request that a non-Euro member in the EU should be at liberty to place *more* regulation on the banking sector *if* they should see fit.",0,1323792482,null,0,true,0,c37ofq1,t3_nasya,t1_c37ofq1,t1_c37o4wb,1428015127,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

France is set *to be* hit hard by a Greek default, even if it has not felt the grindstone yet.  

It is going to take a massive hit if Greece defaults, no doubt about it.  

It's not that France/Sarkozy wants to socialise the burden of Greek debt, it's that he wants to lessen the wave for the private banks so they can keep invested and not pass the burden on.

The problem being there isn't the cash for that if the Greeks don't 'suck up' and take many of the EU styled austerity measures, and they've been aware of these for two years now and they're still protesting, so it doesn't look good.

In summary:

* The collapsing of the housing bubble in the US was the spark that started the crisis, however the conditions at the time made the consequences far more damaging than usual.
* Central banks, especially the Fed, kept interest rates too low for too long. This was both politically expedient and also due to Central banks not really seeing the problems emerging.
* Banks and other modern financial actors like hedge funds thought they were reducing their individual risk through modern financial instruments, e.g. CDOs CDSs and so on. However their actions made the system as a whole far more vulnerable to large shocks.
* The lack of transparency and regulation on a lot of the modern instruments meant that banks couldn't reliably judge the credit worthiness of each other which made the panic far worse.
* Over time many institutions became too reliant on debt and didn't have enough reserves of cash to hold them over when things went south.

Some of Sweden's politicians have already indicated that the parliament may well not give their approval to this agreement. 


That is not what you said before you are changing the argument. I quote ""The fact of the matter is that everyone fucked up, when we decided to open up our economies so much without providing some more integration"". 


We did not fuck up, and I have asked you to provide example of where Sweden did that. Also, we have been paying netto since we joined, *while* battling a financial crises of our own, reforming a our pension system etc. We did not receive any money from the EU then, which is perhaps better in the long run because we were forced to change.


Second, we are in the **EU** together, not the **Euro**. And yes, we might not ever join the Euro, but saying that we have to leave the EU, because we are not joining in with the Euro, is plain bullying. Why? You have to separate those two. And, sidenote, there is no way Sweden is going near the Euro at the moment. A poll published today said a whopping 10% of the population  wants to join..We have more people believing in Martians. 


Third, we have not yet joined the Euro, so we have not integrated the way you imply or the way Eurozone countries have. Why do we then have to pay for the *Eurozone's* mistakes, not ours. And, why do we have to pay in a way *you* decide? (taxes not decided by us)


If the Eurozone countries decide not to obey the rules they themselves set up, decide to rush into a fiscal union without solving the political problems first, to ignore underlying structural problems, to ignore incompatible economies, to ignore rampant corruption in some parts,  the fact that they increase spending without any real growth etc - we didn't do that to you. You did that. You did not create our crises in the 90's , we did not create yours now.  I am OK with transfers has to be done, but I am not OK with a single krona going towards corruption or so other countries don't have to deal with their issues.  Also, I am not OK with paying more than we already are.  That is what the EU want! And the money is going to cover for the deficit they weren't supposed to have in the first place! We are providing plasters to a patient who has cancer....


&gt;They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety

That is correct but I find it unrelated to the point.


Good - then you are not forcing us in any way to implement FTT then? Because doing that is would be clearly undemocratic, wouldn't it and forcing us to give up our freedom.  So, let us then pay what we currently pay and leave us alone then. Forcing issues upon us that has been caused by Eurozone mismanagement is not very democratic, is it and I am glad you are agreeing with me on that. 


What more, I do not believe China, Japan, US *et al.* is going to follow the Eurozones lead, why should they. You can't even get Sweden, Hungary etc to agree with you. Also, our finances is a lot better managed than the avarage EU/Eurozone country and we do not want to hand over more power to you, or more money. Are you saying Sarkozy is better at managing the finances than Anders Borg? 

I have never proposed to dismantle the EU, which you seem to imply but maybe the Euro. That is however, up to the Euro-countries. Just ignore us, while you solve your problems.I do not see why I should pay for the saving of a currency I do not believe in. It will affect us too, greatly, but it is better than throwing billions down the drain for decedes, which is what essentially has been done. Let the recession come then, perhaps that will force the necessary reforms.


Last, long post, but of course I will provide you with links, I'll just do that in next answer. While I agree with you that economics is not the most reliable of sciences (while I have read some economics, I am more of a science scientist myself) I do tend to believe a LSE professor more than some ""unknown"" (in the nicest way possible) arguing on the Internet. I'd like you to provide me with scientific links too, as a base for your belief that China/US will join in and that the FTT will help.

Poul M. Thomsen is a Deputy Director of the IMF’s European Department. He is currently in charge of the IMF’s programs with Greece and Portugal, and also oversees the work of other country teams, including Iceland, Romania, and Ukraine.   
 
""When I  [Poul M. Thomsen] traveled to Reykjavik in October 2008 to offer the IMF’s assistance, the situation 
there was critical. ... 
The program we ended up agreeing in record-time with the Icelandic authorities had four important elements.  

**First**, a team of lawyers was put to work to ensure that losses in the banks were not absorbed by the public sector. In the end, the public sector did of course have to step in and ensure the new banks had adequate capital, but it was insulated from vast private sector losses. This was a major achievement.  

**Second**, the initial focus of the program was exclusively on stabilizing the exchange rate. Here, we reached for unconventional measures, notably capital controls.  

**Third**, automatic stabilizers were allowed to operate in full during the first year of the program—effectively delaying fiscal adjustment. This helped support the economy at a time of severe strain.  

**Fourth**, conditionality was streamlined and focused on the key issue at hand—rebuilding the financial sector. While there are some issues in the broader economy where reforms will eventually be needed, these were not a part of the program"".

As for the €, the only thing the Germans did to us wrong was loaning us money and (apparently) not caring if we invested it wisely or not.

Sure, EU policies like the CAP or the CFP could have been much better employed (they did wreck our national farming, and to some degree, our fisheries, but that was because we joined at the wrong time, when everyone was downsizing their productions and we needed to increase it) but what made the most damage was socialist policies like free computers (the Magalhães) for everyone in school, building football stadiums like there was no tomorrow for Euro 2004 or increasing in the minimum salary and unemployment wages (you have people that could work in industries like cork or textiles but that instead work as maids or waitresses because the government wouldn't allow them to receive the same amount of money if they worked in the industries). Not to mention that it's easier to shut down a factory than to fire 5 or 6 unproductive workers, but that's another story, about how unions can ruin your economy.

Honestly, with the €, the growth you do have is a much more real representation of reality than it was with the $ (escudo), as before the government could just set the exchange or interest rate and adulterate the currency, now we're forced to actually work in order to grow. Obviously our productivity wasn't going to beat the German one, not with our culture and our non-interest, but that's just how things are. We have nobody to blame but ourselves.

Germany isn't a white knight in shinning armor here to save us from ourselves, but they do work much more and harder than we do and our governments policies are (or have been) indeed above its capabilities.

&gt;And I have a feeling that it's going to play out for decades, long after Cameron's shuffled off.

That's true for sure. Some nations may be accustomed to having a non-functioning government (belgium, italy, greece) and having an economy or political system screwed for decades, but for us (the dutch) this is pretty new, and very much unacceptable. (we are spoiled like that)

And I don't think we're alone in this. Either this is solved by the current institutions at the current European scale in a timely manner, or we'll find some scale and some type of political system that will deal with this and effectively protect our interests.

If there isn't a real resolution to this within a year, we'll move to backup plans. Start talks about splitting Europe up, dropping the Euro or trying to get certain nations kicked out of the Euro. All these scenario's are already being investigated now.

The current political system really needs to step it's game, or some group of nations will go their own way. Whatever happens, the power dynamic of Europe will change. It obviously needs to. And the UK isn't really making a compelling ally for anyone at the moment. 

And many haggling politicians seem to be under the impression certain things (like the existence of the EU) are constants. They are not. For many nations, including Holland, if things don't work, you don't want to associated with the status quo, because all political and cultural alignments will gang up against you. Now, I know that spirit doesn't apply to all nations, but i would also like to state, that maybe those nations are a bigger part of the problem right now. 

Today the news told us, that Holland is officially going into recession. (yes, our economy was still growing upto now). That's completely unacceptable and we are now officially in radical mode. And if Germany says 'northern-european-union' out loud, things could move really really quickly.

Although we love many things (culture, food, architecture, people) of Southern Europe, their idea of political culture and the level of quality and the effectiveness of government, isn't something we'll compromise our own prosperity for.

Karlsruhe itself is quite nice. You have the ZKM (a modern museum dedicated to tech in art and art in tech), the Schloss and it's garden, just to name the things right next to the university. You'll probably get to most of those during the week.

As a student in Karlsruhe you will be able to use the public transport of the KVV (Karlsruher Verkehrs Verbund - kvv.de) from 18oo-05oo Monday-Friday and the whole weekend for free. Check the area they cover and you will find lots of beautiful &amp; fun places all around you.

long range: The nearby airport of Baden-Baden offers some flights to multiple cities in Europe and you are ~3h away from Frankfurt/Main airport which gets you anywhere in the world.

medium range: Karlsruhe is connected to the highspeed train network of the ICE (InterCity Express), so you'll reach all major cities in Germany in ~6h (ymmv on time and price) by train. Austria, Netherlands, France, Belgium, Luxemburg and the northern part of Italy are in short flight/train range too.

shorter range: You have the Schwarzwald right in front of you and also the cities of Freiburg and Heidelberg, which are famed for their historic city centres and their overall awesomeness. People from those cities will (be able to) add details.

The state capital of Stuttgart is pretty cool and can be reached in an hour and most of the route is covered by your KVV ticket already. Check out Strasbourg for your quick trip to France or take the Inter-City (express) train to Basel (Switzerland).

true,Mugros,,Niedersachsen,"Growing up with a Turkish boy as a best friend beginning with the Grundschule up to the time I went to the Gymnasium, yes that's true. They lived in a house with mostly Turkish families. The father spoke some German since he was working in a factory. The mother stayed at home and never learned German. I have to admit that this was in a small village and integration was maybe even more difficult almost 30-25 years ago, but I doubt that it is a lot different now.

In bigger cities you have Turkish quarters with mainly Turkish families and Turkish shops. There is no need to socialize with other cultural groups.

Of course, it is easier to integrate people coming from other western cultures. If you're American, British, Swedish, Italian, Greek or Spanish, just learn German and there is practically no problem.

With Turkish people it is different. There seems to be a big fear of losing their culture and that's why they don't want to adapt their life at all to German culture. They do what needs to be done and that's it. One result is the group of young German-Turkish people. Boys and Girls who were raised in Germany, are on paper German but grew up in families that live the Turkish culture, can't speak German well and haven't been integrated. These people have a huge identity problem, because they don't want to be German and separate themselves as being Turkish. But their life is also not that of someone raised in Turkey or having lived there most of their lives. It is quite common for these people to get in conflict with the law. They also develop their own kind of language, made up from bad German and Turkish (mainly swear words). They are not really liked here in Germany, but neither in Turkey.

Luckily there are positive exceptions to what I described. But it is noticeably that there are very few Turkish people in higher job position, even though there are a lot of Turkish in Germany.

I only know a few Arabic people or Muslims. The ones I know were pretty much either raised in western culture or seem to live in a quite modern way. The first one clearly showed me that it is no problem to live in Germany while being a Muslim. But as a fundamentalist Muslim it won't work.

And there are few young people out there who has made more *new money* than those working in finance, gaining bonuses from their work. 

The problem, however, is that banking and tertiary services can be a completely transient branch of the economy. It can take on a nomadic form, and is free to establish itself in any country where the conditions are favourable for maximizing profits. Should the government need more tax income and adjust tax levels, there's nothing preventing the entire industry from simply packing up their things and heading out to a more desireable location. The same problem as with the shipping industry, who merely moves their main office and their ship registration to the Cayman Islands.

In the eastern part there are many Vietnamese stick very much to themselves, quietly, mostly. They do make their children learn German - but I'd suppose this is because for them ""education is important still"", not because ""we have to integrate.""

It's not so much abouo the integration itself, really. There is a small core to the accusations, though. 

We learnt the hard way that even families that already live here for decades, with steady jobs and no registered encounter with the police will, on occasion, reject what we call ""fundamental western values"" - humanitarian values, really -  if it opposes their cultural heritage.

It is also true that these families cluster together and Sarrazzin-approved people prefer to move away from these neighborhoods. There are notable occurences of violations of criminal law (i.e. violations that the government is *required* to act on) are kept under cover and ""solved internally"".

They always say they are English and this is how most immigrants in Germany see their situation as well. If you ask a foreign where he is from, he answers with the country where his/her family has it's origins but only because this is the answer everybody expect.

true,Seefor,DENK,Copenhagen,"From a Danish perspective French politics are plagued by reactionary protectionist opinions and scepticism of capitalism. This is so widespread in France that Denmark will usually side opposite France on market matters (especially the CAP) regardless if France has a Socialist or Conservative PM.

Furthermore, the very active role that the French state has in labour politics is the complete opposite of the Danish flexicurity system, and the French system is reknown for its ineffectiveness. Most people have stories of getting bad service in France because their job protection is so high that the employees don't really care. The low pension age and low working hours is also something that puzzles us.

And French unions - especially the farmers - are notorious for striking and being militant. A very different situation from the consensus-seeking collective negotiations in Denmark. It's a standing joke that we can't get our reforms of the CAP pushed through because the French will block it out of fear of having their roads blocked with manure. 

So yeah, on matters of market and labour policies I suppose we're not very hopeful no matter who's the President in France, because those opinions are so entrenched in French society. I had hoped that Sarkozy would carry out some reforms to increase flexibility in the French system.

Oh, and as a side note, the French national chauvenism seems to be prevalent in all your parties too. Stop the moving circus of the Parliament to Strasbourg? Non! And the only reason for spending European tax money on it is that it is in France...

Why? That is the whole problem though. Pussy-foot about the issue as much as you want but if you're calling me a racist (I think that's what is being implied) for stating something which everybody knows, but nobody wants to admit for fear of being branded as prejudiced then that's not cool.

Your tired memes aside, places like Aulnay-sous-Bois can be equated with the area just outside... Göteborg in Sweden (I think it's there). The country is unlike many others in that it has an immigration and integration policy which really works well. Any sane person who believes in the concept of ""solidarity"" will see that ""hurrr, immigrants"" isn't a bad thing. This particular town though has a very high number of non-Swedish nationals living in government housing and they're angry. They're angry because they feel that no-one cares about them and they feel marginalised. As a result, crime is higher in the immediate area as the young here feel like they have no future, despite having come to Sweden for a better life.

You've just got to look at areas of London, it's the same. Wherever there are people feeling alienated and marginalised from society, this problem will arise, regardless of *who* the groups involved are.

So, just *don't* imply that I'm a racist because I have a brain in my head and am actually prepared to talk and *think* about this, as opposed to almost all French people I know who like to brush it under the carpet as their ""embarrassing little secret"".

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;But if you look very very careful at the graph you see even more telling details. For example that the 5 years of preparation of the Euro brought extreme advantages for every single country. It seems that the fact that europe united for a monetary union helped even the top performers to perform (much) better. Now that's interesting.  
  
We should remember that the years of low-interest bonds (and therefore years of high confidence) were also the boom years, which were themselves fuelled by the burgeoning housing bubble.  
  
What we can definitely see is that, generally speaking, the countries who were performing best before the introduction of the euro are the ones who have come out of the crisis the best, and vice versa.  
  
However, I find it very disconcerting that Ireland was essentially the third best-performing country on that chart before the introduction of the euro, and yet is the second worst-performing country after it (at least in terms of bond yields as a reflection of confidence).  I certainly remember people complaining in the early 2000s that eurozone interest rates were inappropriate for Ireland.  It seems that membership of the euro may have have actually had a negative overall impact on confidence in Ireland's government bonds.  
  
&gt;The housing crisis did not reveal a fundamental flaw in the idea of a monetary union. It revealed the lack of solidarity, which was unexpected by investors.  
  
I think you're absolutely right about eurozone bonds being necessary, but even that just feels like a half-measure to me.  I can't help but feel that the eurozone needs to become a completely separate financial system.  If you're going to have a single currency, with a shared central bank and eurozone bonds, you go all the way and have total financial union.  Eliminate German, Greek, and French bonds completely in favour of eurozone bonds, and do away with the DAX and the CAC40 in favour of a eurozone stock exchange.  
  
As you say, solidarity is the main issue - really changing the system so that the whole zone is forced to sink or swim together would, I believe, go a long way towards properly stabilising the euro.",0,1323877361,null,0,false,0,c37zlbe,t3_nbx9s,t1_c37zlbe,t1_c37ydo6,1428020456,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

And why should anybody be put in prison or anything else because of a drug? Why does it make it right because the person is dealing, how else are people supposed to get drugs? And drug tourists would not be a thing if it wasn't just isolated to the Netherlands. Alcohol is the obvious one as well, that causes a great deal of bad behaviour. And still here we are. 

What I think is that people would like to ban both Alcohol and Tobacco, but they can't. So they feel free to pick on weaker targets. It's just all about naked power and control, like so much is turning into (or has always been perhaps). Alcohol because it's practically ingrained in European culture (and other places) since before the dawn of history. And tobacco because it evolved into a massive powerhouse involving lots of people too powerful to fail. 

So basically it's because people do not learn. Power is still the alter which we all crowd around and worship. We're still all prepared to put ourselves and others through hardship in order to keep power.

&gt;Hey, I am a so called Turkish-German. life as an immigrant in germany is not easy. Its not that the german people are nazis (Its so complicated, i could write a whole book about it) but theres still racism against strangers, especially against turkish people. The major part of the immigrants are turkish.

I think that the story of my family explains a lot: My father and his parents arrived in germany when he was just 16. They came to work and had big dreams (probably like the american dream). But they were only disappointed by the people and the government. Just imagine: they had to live in a former pigsty and the situation of other immigrants were not better probably even worse. They were treated like robots and not like humans and were exploited and so on ...

I remember the first years of nursery school: as a kid i didnt recognize yet that im so ""different"" than the other kids. Kids dont care much about how u look. Many times they dont even ask what ur name is. They just start playin and laughin. But when i saw how their parents were comin everyday to collect their kids things started gettin different. I mostly had to go home alone cause my parents had to work. And even if they collected me it was kinda embarassing for me cause my mother was standin there alone while other parents were talking with each other. Sometimes they even made fun of her cause she wears a headscarf. When we were talkin Turkish other kids started laughin and asked whether this was even a language while their parents just looked amused. though she never cared about them and looked at me just smilin it was embarassing for me. I honestly hated her for being different and I didnt want her to collect me anymore. I was ashamed of my own culture and people.

So i stopped speakin turkish, copied their lifestyle and told them people that im german; typical behaviour of people with an inferiority complex which is still a big problem of immigrants. I kept this behaviour till highschool. Though i was like them they always let me feel that im different. They still made jokes about my culture and my religion. They still called me ""kanacke"" (thats what they call us immigrants here, maybe comparable with ""nigger"" but not that bad) and ordered me to take away the rubbish and silly things like that.

Kids never invited me to their parties cause their parents considered that i would have a bad influence on their children (though i was the most social child in class). The teachers still told me that i have to integrate into the society and so on. Eventually in the highschool i had enough. I changed my whole outfit, started to hang out with only foreign people, u know kinda gangs, i had permanently a ""rude facial expression"" and i disrespected all teachers who told me to be more ""integrated"" If i tryna tell them my life theyre like ""what, you try to tell me all this is happenin HERE, in GERMANY!? Please man, are u kiddin me?!"" people just dont want to believe it even if its totally clear. They say were responsible for our own situation. ""you immigrants cant adapt into the society"". Yeah we cant adapt cause they never accepted us. Just imagine: german statistics say if your name sounds foreign you have to write AT LEAST 3 times more applications to get only an interview. E.g. i know s.b. who studied architecture and finished the university with the best grade. Guess what: he searched for 6 months to get a job and he has only got invited to one interview and there they told him that he can work but he will get less salary.

Its just disturbing, all this struggle to live a normal life. Because all of that the youth just doesnt want to speak anymore. They've enough of all the hatred and racism and so they end up in the streets. Me and my friends never had a real childhood: while other kids were playin hide and seek or things like that, we in our ""hood"" took our boxing gloves and went outside to fight. The kids become psycopats here cause all this shit is unbearable, especially for a child. its just sick! Though today im “normal” again, thanks to my religion, its really hard to keep the patience. Everyday I have to listen to silly jokes and have to watch the news blaming migrants. People might say “don’t take it that serious, these r just little things.” But in german we say “Steter Tropfen höhlt den Stein!” which hast he same meaning as the english phrase „Little strokes fell big oaks.“. Don’t get me wrong! I neither blame the Germans nor the Turkish people. Both have to do something to solve this problem. But I can say about myself and many other people that we made much more steps towards the german society than they did. But I didn’t lose my hope cause I also see little positive developments everyday. U know: “slow motion better than no motion” ;) I hope I could bring across my point of view and im always ready to discuss and talk about things like that. Im always open towards other opinions and I’d love to hear’em! sorry if I made mistakes. Yet, my English is not perfect ;) !!! PEACE !!!

Altered mind -&gt; altered behavior. For better or worse.

&gt;What choices do we make that are outside the physical world? 

Difficult philosophical question, totally has nothing to do with the question at hand as responsibility is not some tool to restore some super cosmic justice and fairness but both a rough tool to get certain results plus a satisfaction of certain instincts.

&gt;And why should anybody be put in prison or anything else because of a drug?

I didn't say we should and actually as far as small quantities go in most EU countries we don't,  but that's a completely different story from seeing it as a simple health issue and not a social one. My point is simply that the health part of it is not the total story and the problem won't go away by healing alone. Not by prisons either. 

&gt;What I think is that people would like to ban both Alcohol and Tobacco, but they can't.

Correct. They are constantly putting more and more pressure on tobacco, like banning smoking in public places, even forbidding workplaces to establish a closed smoking shelter outside. I think a lot of people would actually like to ban it just can't, exactly. As for alcohol I think there is less pressure, as they are such an important part of our culture, people consider stuff like Dom Perignon a kind of very fine craftsmanship, a work of art almost, it would be sad if these things went out of existence.

&gt;Power is still the alter which we all crowd around and worship. 

Correct but irrelevant. Power is indeed one of the most exciting things, just look at a ""strategy"" videogame like Medieval Total War 2. However IMHO most people enjoy exercising it directly.

The reason why things are still getting worser in Greece is because the real economy hasn't had time to adjust. For example Greece has two times more teachers than Finland, that to note scored at the top of the PISA study, thus what needs to be done is to get rid of half of the teachers. Unfortunately organizations don't change so quickly, and worse than that, people themselves can't change that quickly. Those laid of teachers would have to re-educate and get a new  job.

What the EU and Greece are doing is walking in a fine line, if the EU doesn't give enough slack, things worsen too quickly, and if Greece doesn't do enough reforms and re-organize itself quickly enough, money is being wasted, and that can lead to a point where money stops flowing.

What we are seeing now in Greece is comparable to a situation where the west after the fall of communism would have assisted the ex-Soviet block with a strict economic guidance in exchange of assistance.

true,Norrsken,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;No one is supposed to be forcing anyone. All your country needs to do is stay out of the agreements and the FTT won't be implemented in its territory. I don't really get why you're correlating a joint decision of a set of countries to enact a common tax as a loss of freedom. 


No one is supposed to........And no one is suppose to cheat and be corrupt with EU money, lie to get into the Euro etc either, but that hasn't stopped a lot of countries. Everyone is supposed to pull their own weight too, but most don't. So when you say ""No one is supposed to"", I believe in that as much about as much as I believe in Berlosconis honesty and good heart (although I believe you, Naurgul is honest, but you are most likely not Merkel/Sarkozy or another prominent EU person). 


The Eurozone will bully other countries ecause you will need other countries to join up, or the trade will move, and ther will be huge financial losses.  The implementation of similar taxes shows that, and basically every theory supports it. Thus, you will need to put pressure on countries to make them implement the tax. What is ""the diplomacy"" that you are going to get China aboard about then? How are you going to get a possible republican president (US) and a republican senate to vote yes. By not putting pressure on those countries? Asking them to loose money and implement umpopular taxes to cover for bad European economics? 


I'd really really like you to show me how it has been done before, or just the theory/reasoning behind how you are going to convince China and the US, I am longing for those articles actually, and I am not being ironic, I think it would be a very interesting read.


Or are you saying that if you implement the tax the trade will not move, even if the traders can earn more money if they do their deals in London or Stockholm. Is that what you are saying? In my mind you seem to be saying one of these two things, perhaps you could enlighten me to which one.


A) The Eurozone implement the FTT, and the traders will stay within the Eurozone  (Paris/Frankfurt), even if they can move and avoid the tax elsewhere, like London/Stockholm.The Eurozone politely ask other countries if they want to join, and they are OK if no one else wants to join. 


B) We (the world) implement the FTT all across the world simultaniuosly, and everyone benefits from the FTT. Everyone has seen the value of the FTT, and are doing it to help Europe's failing economies.


I believe in:

C) The Eurozone implements it, the trade will move, they will lose money and more lose of prestige and remove the tax. Before that though, they will bully (or as you say, be diplomatic about it) other countries to implement it to. Maybe small countries like mine have to obey, maybe not. They will not get London, China, US, Canada, Australia, Russia, Japan, Brazil along, no way. 


If I got it wrong with A and B, please enlighten me to what you think will happen when you implement the FTT then.

I personally think that apprenticeships aren't necessarily the best way to teach for manual work. In apprenticeship you learn from one job, however it is a completely different thing on are those things done correctly.

Debt wasn't really a problem as that was denominated largely in the British Pounds.

Furthermore, a 50% devaluation is not the end of the world.

Sterling has devalued 30% against the euro since 2007.   Sterling is back on the way to regaining 2007 values against the euro and if the euro is still there in a few years the euro may well be trading at more than a 30% discount to it's 2007 value to the pound.

As we can see from here and I think it's accurate,

http://www.miketodd.net/encyc/dollhist-graph.htm

The dollar has fluctuated against the pound in the range of c. $2.50 per £1.00 to c. $1.00 per £1.00, since about 1973.

And life goes on with all it's problems and woe as well as dancing and laughing.

Currency fluctuation is the lesser evil than the slow, inevitable death of economic strangulation gratis the euro.

Ethnicity was often defined by language and language was often defined one's trade/socio-economic status.

Marx' observation that ""history ... is the history of class struggle"" takes on a rather prosaic tint in the context of multi-cultural/multi-ethnic 19 th century Mitteleuropa.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"I have to disagree with you. Fiscal discipline is not Northern European invention, before the crisis Portugal and Spain had enough fiscal discipline and Italy was slowly addressing its debt issue. After the crisis hit, Spain has probably done the most to address its short comings, and Italy and Portugal are right behind it. However Greece is in whole another category, with them I agree that it will take time before the political culture adjusts, but I don't think that is impossible.

Furthermore when we are talking about devaluation, there is a large difference if a country like Britain faces a devaluation than a small country like for example Finland. The difference being that a small economy is relatively more linked with the world economy than an economy of large country. Thus when a small country devalues its currency, there are more private companies and individuals that suffer from it. More so we have to remember that small countries have smaller credibility in the markets and that credibility can disappear more quickly than with a big country.

Maybe I suffer from the trauma of the depression that happened in the beginning of 90s. What happened then was that there was huge domino collapse of companies and individuals going bust and taking banks with them: first bankcrupcies were companies and individuals with foreign loans, the next ones were victims of the failures. At that time there were two options, either devaluate the external value of make an internal devaluation, it was calculated that by lowering 2-5% of all wages, we could have prevented the devaluation of our currency. We didn't do that and we suffered from the consequences.

In my honest opinion, it is a better choice to force the society and the economy to change than to buy time by doing a devaluation and keeping things how they are. And if we go back on the issue of forcing the society to change, I believe that the EU can offer more humane way of obligatory change than being crushed by the market.",0,1323895670,null,0,false,0,c382r3o,t3_nca0g,t1_c382r3o,t1_c382aku,1428022009,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

El problema es que, si autores como Hawking tienen razón, la religión se propaga como un virus. Se enseña en las casas por los padres, en las escuelas por los profesores, se propaga en la tele, se transmite en el boca a boca, se ejemplifica en los monumentos religiosos, en los templos, en la construcción de edificios arquitectónicos erigidos para honrar deidades, en los libros de propaganda religiosa, etcétera. Y los niños crecen con todo eso alrededor, por lo que se contagian del virus y ellos mismos lo transmiten a otros a lo largo de su vida, incluidos sus hijos.

Es muy difícil combatir la religión organizada, sobre todo si la esfera política no ayuda, y es difícil que lo haga mientras los votantes sean en su mayoría creyentes.

That's a sort of pressure that builds and builds until its on par with the Bastille.  Then again I always thought that if they really were in the business of helping people the Vatican would have put all its loot up for sale a long time ago.

 Do you really think that the Eurozone (do not say Europe, or even the EU, do not include us in your schemes, is so powerful at the moment, that they can blackmail them the rest of the free world? For a controversial tax? You said *Europe* . The rest of the world  have access to the market - Sweden, UK and other countries are not in the FTT/Eurozone. You are always talking like the Eurozone is Europe/EU. It is not!!!!  And, for your information - Sweden is against it on a scale that it would take a military coup to get us to join, and the UK too


So, if you want us with you, you will have to blackmail or invade us - how do that goes with your  democratic ideal.  Let me remind you about the quote I said before:


They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety? 

We  will say no, so there will only be C, unless you take our liberty from us. And then you deserve none yourself! 


&gt;If a tax like this is the only thing standing between the continuation of the current system and financial ruin,

Of course it isn't. It is very naive to think one tax, or one move can save (or ruin for that matter) economies. There are a hundred other moves the Eurozone could make, from saving banks differently (and actually letting some of them fail), to reforming pensions systems, increasing efficiency, stopping corruption etc. Even if the FTT tax was implemented and worked perfectly, it can not save the Eurozone, the problems are to big. 


&gt;Europe can not only blackmail them by denying them access to its markets but it can also make a pretty good argument that if they don't play along the world's economy will go to the gutter. That's a convincing argument isn't it?


No, it isn't, it is one of the worst I have seen. A free market need to have market failures to work. You are once again mixing up Eurozone and Europe, but this time with the world. If you are reading papers like Wall Street Journal, Financial Times or just following the general debate you will know that most politicians and influential finance guys/economists (even if you don't listen, other people do) outside the Eurozone is saying the Euro is dead and it is finacially unsound to save it. So, what you essentially have is a lot of failed economies who are globally very small (Greece, Portugal) some small ones who will do excellent on their own (Austria, Finland etc) and 2 big ones (Germany and France) who will struggle, but survive on their own. The only two countries really important to the world economy is Germany/France. And you are suggesting that these to, without the backup from UK will blackmail the rest of the world!  You are honestly beyone naive and can't even know the basic of size of other economies. This is not 1960. The worlds biggest economies aren't even in Europe. China is growing with a bloody Spain size economy/year. India is over a billion people. *We* are begging them to let *us* into their market. 


Yes, there will be a recession, we are already in one, with or without the Euro. And yes, it is possible, but financially unsound to save it, but it will cost an arm, leg, head, and your grandchildrens souls. Do not believe the rest of the world will fall for that, it is a German/French vanity project, and the rest of the Eurozone are just to deep in the shit or need the help to much. If you do want to save it though, you have to be smart. Believe me, implementing the FTT is one of the most unsmart things you can do, and it will lessen the worlds confidence even more in you. The market do not think like you do, they think like I do, which all the articles I send you showed. Doesn't matter if you like them or not, the market listens to people like that more than to you.

jajaja es la primera vez que oigo esa expresión.

Estoy de acuerdo, el poder de los lobbys en EEUU no conoce límites. Tanto en religión como en intereses económicos.

En primer lugar, la imbricación entre esfera empresarial y política no sólo es total sino que además es comúnmente aceptada. Lo normal es que los congresistas y senadores tengan, además de su cargo, sus propias empresas. Eso significa que leyes y normas son legisladas a gusto de cada uno en función de intereses creados.

Y algo parecido sucede con la religión. Los políticos que hacen las leyes son ellos mismos partícipes de comunidades religiosas.

Y el furor religioso es tan fuerte entre la población que basta con que los puritanos digan ""BLANCO"" para que los medios de comunicación, los políticos y los borregos de turno también digan ""BLANCO"". Porque Jesús lo quiere.

El problema de la locura delirante es que se contagia con una facilidad pasmosa, y sirve además de excusa para defender intereses creados.

Precisamente. Eso no sucede en Europa. La presión social no existe en absoluto. Para empezar, es muy raro la persona que vaya a la iglesia. La mayoría de los servicios religiosos están vacíos, salvo por personas mayores, unas pocas familias católicas y ahora muchos inmigrantes sudamericanos que tienden a ser creyentes.

La costumbre yanqui de ir por hábito u obligación a la iglesia está desapareciendo aquí. Tampoco se reza antes de las comidas. Nunca. Cuando lo vemos en las películas nos resulta extraño, y es entre triste y cómico saber que toda una nación habla con un ser imaginario antes de comer jaja.

&gt; creo que un otro causa de esta imagen es que en las noticias y el internet, solo veas las cuentas de cosas malas o algunas personas

A juzgar por lo que leo, Internet parece ser más ateo que la sociedad en general. Y aún así, está lleno de frikis religiosos.

Por ejemplo, ¿es verdad que hay gente joven que sigue defendiendo el creacionismo y su enseñanza en la escuela? A veces me entretengo leyendo perfiles americanos de OK Cupid y más de una vez he visto la respuesta ""debería enseñarse en el colegio"" a esa pregunta. Es de locos.

¿Es verdad, como he visto en algún rage comic, que compañeros de trabajo o amigos no entienden que se puede ser ateo y piensan que necesariamente hay que pertenecer a una iglesia?

Para algunos de las preguntas:


&gt;¿es verdad que hay gente joven que sigue defendiendo el creacionismo y su enseñanza en la escuela?

En mis experiencias solo es uno o dos jovenes extremos quien defende al creacionismo. Por ejemplo, asisto a un universidad de unos 50,000 estudiantes, y problamente hay diez de ellos quien defende al creacionismo. Como todo, siempre hay algunos locos, pero la mayoría tiene creencias más progresivas. 


&gt;¿Es verdad, como he visto en algún rage comic, que compañeros de trabajo o amigos no entienden que se puede ser ateo y piensan que necesariamente hay que pertenecer a una iglesia?


Lo mismo como el creacionismo, si, hay algunos quien no pueden entender una vida sin religión. Y, de hecho, muchos de sus amigos creen lo mismo y por eso la gente ignorantes nunca crecen o entienden a otros.


&gt;¿No es Rick Perry un candidato político serio?


No se en que sentido preguntas eso, pero de verdad, el ya es un candidato serio. Para cada uno en Reddit que dijo ""que tonto Rick Perry es"" o ""que malo que el no acepta los homosexuales"", hay dos otros en el mundo que vea a él como un hombre intelligente y apoya a él porque están de acuerdo que no es Cristiano para los homosexuales estar casados. 

&gt;Ayer empecé a ver una película de Bruce Willis y en una cafetería uno de los carteles decía ""In God we trust. All others pay cash"" o algo así. ¿Es América tan religiosa como se ve en las películas?


En algunos partes, como en el sur, y fuera de las ciudades, si, más o menos, es tan religioso como se ve en las películas. La broma en ""In God we trust. All others pay cash"" es que en todo el efectivo, ""In God We Trust"" está imprimido en un parte, entonces, no es tanto un sentimiento religioso, sino un chiste que el dueño solo tengan fé en Dios, y no acepten credito ni la palabra de la gente para pagar.

But I think this was a veneer of discipline overlying a profundity of dysfunction.

Italian debt had reached a level that it could easily become unsupportable in a severe downturn, like this one and the Spanish economy had become skewed by an unsustainable construction sector.

You only have to drive along the ""costas"", hopefully on your way to somewhere better, to know there's a lot of very bad business being done all over that place.

I don't want to argue fiscal discipline is a Northern European ""invention"" when the Germans have a debt of c.80% of GDP.

But the observation I cannot escape is that the problems in the Greek economy are not solved by having a currency that is horribly overvalued for a Greek context and austerity imposed from abroad that is killing domestic demand.

I think the Greeks need to find domestic solutions not German ones to these Greek problems and the same goes for Italy, Spain and Portugal.

Even though I'm not a native speaker, Google Translate is shitty. 

You were using the right tenses, but forming them wrong. Just to make sure you get it, I'll say it in english. In German, the past perfect and the future tenses are formed by putting the verb at the end of a clause and adding an auxillary. In the future tense you add werden, and in the past perfect you add either sein or haben depending on the verb. In the past tense you also use the past participle form of the verb. The future tense requires the infinitive. Thus:

Past - *Ich habe es gelernt* I learned it

Present - *Ich lerne es* I'm learning it

Future - *Ich werde es lernen* I will learn it

This is the simple explanation for how how tenses work in German. There's actually two more past tenses and the future tense can be formed from the present tense with certain adverbs. But, for a beginner this is what you should be drilling first. Have fun in Frankfurt, dude. :3

Taking up more new debt than what you invested has always been unconstitutional in Germany. There's of course higher-ranking considerations, like the continuation of the free and democratic basic order... which, and now comes a point, may be in danger because something can't be financed, or it could be in danger because too much debt is taken up, causing all future parliaments to lose all room of manoeuvre.

And parliament isn't allowed to abolish democracy, even with an unanimous vote. That's plain unconstitutional.

So all in all I'd say it's *very* sensible to have a court that's able to check whether a budget is legal.

You see one of the options to deal with the Greek debt crisis is for the ECB to conduct a ""stealth"" buying program where it buys as much as it gets undervalued Greek bonds. After it has conducted this buying program, ECB organizes financing via third party, likely a Greek bank, for the Greek state to buy the debt from the ECB. This would allow Greece to write off a big huge number of its debt, private bond holders would get rid of their Greek bonds, everyone would win except of course the ECB and in essence holders of Euro.

Now of course this is a very dodgy thing to do. In my honest opinion an act like this would more or less constitute a reason to lower Greece's credit rating into D and let it stay there for decades. However the reason why I mentioned this example is that credit ratings aren't just about getting the money back, they encompass much more.

The problem is that the Eurozone politicians still don't seem to understand that politics and economics cannot be decoupled when dealing with a government debt crisis. if there isn't the confidence in the politicians to sort out the mess then the economics, if not already fucked, will become fucked very quickly.

The rating agencies have, quite rightly in my opinion, decided that they've seen enough bluster and summits from the EU with nothing approaching a solution coming out of them. meanwhile our friends in Brussels seem to think that continuing to talk about perhaps talking about doing something next year will be enough.

There are several options which can be taken to resolve the Euro crisis.

The ECB printing money is probably the easiest option but it will spell problems in the long term.

The problem for the Euro and for Sterling too, is insolvent banks.
If the banks are insolvent then the insolvency has to be purged.

Printing money has many effects (especially on consumers/workers) and is not the save-all solution that pays debts. Further, the Eurozone could print money (but only jointly) if they wanted to. There also is a reason that central banks are indpendent from government: Else the government could always just make more and more debts and then shift the cost (through printing money) and other negative effects on the citizens. That's what will ensure that no government ever lives within its budget.

Administrative paralysis is not really a good reason for downgrading. Ratings are supposed to mirror the chance of a loan being paid back - that can even happen with administrative paralysis since that is generally temporary, but not if debt increases as rapidly as in the UK (highest deficit in the EU, see discussion above)

Inflation is classically defined as,

The goods/supply are all ready out there in the economy.

That is such a straw man comment as to be unworthy of reply, sadly.

The US was downgraded because administrative paralysis called into question the ability of the US to manage its debt, if I recall those events correctly.

And the UK can afford a larger deficit than other EU countries because it's debt is smaller than other country's.   The UK debt is, I'd guess, c.65% of it's GDP where as the German debt is more than 80% of German GDP.

On the UK - one of the commenters there expresses it better than I could:

&gt; I'm puzzled by the article on Britain. It states that the Government stepped in and absorbed the banks losses. This is true, some of the banks have been partially nationalised. So no bank has gone out business therefore how can billions of euros in savings of ordinary customers have been gambled away? This is totally untrue, nobody has lost their savings. Are UK banks in a worse state than a lot of continental ones? I don't think so.

&gt; The author imples that bailing out the banks is what caused Britain's own debt problems. This is again rubbish. The cost of the bailouts is small compared to the overall debt. The more accurate reason is that the previous Labour Government spent too much!

&gt; Financial Transaction Tax – if that is imposed solely in the EU then a lot of transactions would simply be done in the USA or Asia. If it must be imposed why not get agreement among the G20 to have it applied globally? A Financial Transaction Tax would ultimately hit pension funds who would bear this tax when they wanted to move investments around.

&gt; The Financial Regulation the EU wants to introduce is less about preventing another credit crunch and more about moving business from the City of London to Paris and Frankfurt. The latest EU diktat is that banks handling Euro denominated trades must be located within the Eurozone. Why? This is an attack on the single market.

&gt; Cameron was accused last week of blocking attempts to regulate banks but one of the things he wanted was to retain the right of the Government to demand that certain UK banks hold more capital than the EU requires. So that's more regulation not less.

&gt; ..the trading should be allowed to take place anywhere. Not being in the Euro has got nothing to do with where trading takes place. We don't seek to prevent trading of Pound Sterling transactions in Frankfurt or Paris. The UK is still in the Single Market so shouldn't be discriminated against.

Anni di stadio e di partite con mio padre e mio fratello - poi per un periodo ho smesso completamente di seguirlo, di guardare le partite, di leggere le notizie, di sentire la radio. Stavo *benissimo*. Poi boh, la Fiorentina finì in C2, mio padre si abbonò a Sky e mi invitava a vedere le partite. Sentivo in giro che si parlava di questa squadra buffa, il centravanti era un muratore di Lipari un po' sovrappeso, a Gubbio i tifosi delle due squadre spalarono insieme la neve dal campo per vedere la partita. Insomma mi sono intossicato di nuovo e sono tornato a seguire il calcio, che pure sotto molti punti di vista mi fa schifo - a volte mi dico di smettere per tanti buoni motivi, ma in fin dei conti mi piace troppo il momento di condivisione della partita, con gli amici, e con la mia famiglia. Non vado più allo stadio ma la partita la domenica la vedo spesso. 
Lo vedo come un piacevole vizio che vorrei non avere ma che mi fa compagnia, come fumare o prendermi una ciucca il sabato sera. 
Alla fine sono d'accordo con chi non guarda il calcio, tutte le critiche solitamente rivolte al calcio e ai tifosi di calcio sono giustissime e condivisibili, e capisco l'insofferenza davanti a uno sport sovraesposto, troppo discusso (e per di più in maniera insulsa), preso troppo sul serio e in larga parte antisportivo. 
Una delle caratteristiche più brutte del tifoso di calcio è che dà per scontato che tutti adorino lo sport quanto lui, e infligge a chiunque discorsi su questa o quella gara, questo o quel calciatore. Io cerco di non parlare di calcio in presenza di persone che non sono interessate, e trovo che sia antipatico farlo.

true,TomorrowsMisquote,GERM,Germany,"&gt; In economics, inflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. Consequently, inflation also reflects an erosion in the purchasing power of money – a loss of real value in the internal medium of exchange and unit of account in the economy. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation)

Money printed to shovel into ~~bank balance sheets~~ *paying off debts* doesn't just disappear there. It feeds the money supply and can cause inflation if there are no strong contrary factors.

Also, [hyperinflation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation#Root_causes_of_hyperinflation)

&gt; By definition, hyperinflation is a rapid increase in Price Index (the Money Supply multiplied by the velocity of money) without a corresponding increase in real output (see Equation of exchange). This is often caused by decisions on the part of the central bank to increase the money supply much more than markets had previously expected, often when money is printed to finance government spending.

Oh, and ""The goods/supply are all ready out there in the economy."" Is quite a big statement without evidence.

&gt; How are the London riots representative of xenophobia and racism? How does one leave a brain on a hat stand?

Cops shooting an unarmed member of an ethnic minority, fudging evidence (how did that gun end up there?) as well as testimonies, two houndred (iirc) people demonstrating for a proper investigation being ignored, a known record of ethnic minorities being way more likely to be suspect to ""random"" pat-downs, the resulting riots having the distinct smell of disenfranchised youth finally being able to get x-boxes they could never ever have bought because it's impossible to get a job... but your perception surely differs.

&gt; What do the Hartz reforms have to do with xenophobia and racism?

Not much, directly, though adherents to extreme right-wing ideas are usually low to no-income. It's got everything to do with stigmatisation, the middle class fearing their own downfall and thus beating down while their up, etc. pp. Statistical correlation to a widening income gap and bad low-wage working conditions to *group-focussed enmity* (that's the proper term) is overwhelming.

Also, I'm always sceptical when a Brit complains about xenophobia in Germany, because a) Brits don't fall into the usual victim schemas (now that'd be different as, say, a Turk)... I'd *really* be surprised if any German would consider you to be more alien than, say, an Icelander, and we *love* Icelanders, and b) Brits tend to confuse German frankness for impoliteness or hate because they, themselves, posses an endemic ""politeness"" being nothing else but a lack of sincerity, spine, and purpose.

When I lend money to someone with the aim to profit from it, I set the interest rate at such a level that it covers the inflation I expect + some %s for profit. At the end I expect the (original amount + inflation = original value) + profit.

The way you describe investments/lending means it would be ok to lend to countries with hyperinflation at a modest rate of interest, which is a bad idea. Unless all other options are worse or I my motive isn't to make profit, I shouldn't lend money to that country but invest elsewhere or simply keep the money under a mattress.



&gt; The country's ability to pay back its debt is as much of a weight on its grade as its inflation.

That's something I agree with. The point I was trying to make though was that being in control of your currency puts you in a better spot, but not necessarily in a good spot. For the good spot other factors matter more.
If you control your currency, and thus inflation, and raise inflation, to pay your debt, to a rate the investor didn't expect, then controlling your currency is a bad thing from the POV of the investor. All under the assumption that the country is healthy and normally able to service its debt. Which I think holds for the UK.
However if you can't service your debt w/o using inflation, then it probably is better to get the money back even at a reduced value.
In contrast the Eurozone countries can't use inflation in that way, to service their debt. Which is ok, unless you took up unhealthy amounts of debt due to a crisis/fudging the books/etc., then you need a bailout, convince your lenders to take cuts, introduce (severe) austerity measures, find a lender of last resort.
Which is the crux of the Euro crises. Some countries can't service their debt/roll it over, and the use of inflation is currently being denied to them.

true,SimonGray,DENK,Nørrebro,"Your point about shipping is not true. It's more expensive to ship to Europe. Most consumer electronics from China are shipped from around Guangzhou/Hong Kong. There is basically a straight line from there to the US West coast while going to Europe takes you on a long journey down below India and through the Suez canal (which in itself adds to costs) and finally probably ends up in a port in the Netherlands which is a typical drop-off point. Add to that high taxes on petrol in Europe for inland delivery versus almost non-existing taxes in the US.

Labour costs in Europe are generally higher due to higher minimum wages or union negotiated wages.

There are also translation costs which makes certain products more expensive in smaller countries.

As others mentioned, consumer protection is generally higher. The minimum warranty in Denmark for all products is 2 years.

You mentioned taxes yourself. They add a lot. Here in Denmark it's 25% VAT versus 0% advertised on US products, but of course you have to pay something. There's some psychological effect here. Also add other indirect taxes.

Currency fluctuations. Since a lot of international trade is conducted in Dollars, companies like to add some extra margin to reduce risk.

Tariffs.

Pricing to market. You see it here in Denmark where people are willing to pay 15 kr for a bottle of Coke while there are perfectly fine Danish colas available for 5 kr. Generally, all international brand sodas are priced at 15 kr while all Danish discount sodas are prices at around 5 kr. People put up with this because they're used to this virtual distinction. The big brand stuff and the discount stuff is produced by the same companies here in DK, licensing the Coke brand does not add 10 kr to costs.",0,1324009775,null,0,false,0,c38i9qr,t3_ndpke,t1_c38i9qr,t3_ndpke,1428029461,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3
