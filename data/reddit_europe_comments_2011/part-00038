If there would be a conflict in the middle-east and Israel would be part of it, we would have to defend and support Israel. Today this scenario might not be that expensive, but if and when in the next 20-30 years Arab countries develop and become more prosperous, thus more powerful, shielding of Israel would cost lots of money, man power and weaponry.

Not to forget that Israel has bad relationships with its Arab neighbours. If Israel would be EU member, it would reflect badly to Europe and worsen European political and trade relations to Arab countries. This would cost real money and weaken the European sphere of influence in the area.

Then there is the thing that Israel is not a European country nor culture. For example Samuel P. Huntington classified Israel as its own civilisation, not a part of the western civilisation.

Less bitterness means the other flavors come through more.  The fruity flavors are generally esters and phenols given off by the yeast during fermentation, and their flavors will vary depending on type of yeast and the fermentation temperature.

In addition to the collection of opposition organization and independent news sites spreading news of abuses and protests, there is a large social networking component, mostly through VKontakte (sort of of like Russian Facebook). Even protests are organized there as ""events.""

In return , the government is attempting to silence and control these. This is includes arresting, beating and intimidating online activists and people running/posting to the VKontakte groups. It also includes DDoS attacks on opposition sites such as Charter97 and on independent news sources such as REF/RL (something the government also did during protests against the fraudulent December 2010 elections). 

Even more interesting, it includes some sneaky redirecting through the national Belorussian ISP Beltelecom. For example, visitors in Belarus attempting to access the VKontakte even page organizing real-life protests are redirected to a phishing page that looks like its from VKontakte, but which asks visitors for their mobile numbers to confirm their identity. In Belarus you can't buy a SIM card without showing your passport, and having that information recorded, so anyone who fell for this would be giving the state their real name and open themselves up to pressure and real risk (they might fall for it if they weren't paying attention because VKontakte uses SMSes *from* the company for some security measures). 

In another case, Belorussians visitors to the opposition site Charter 97 were redirected to a site that looked like Charter97 but which attempted to install malcode on visitors' computers. Most AV solution identified this, but it is enough to frighten away already-nervous potential supporters of the opposition (this is an old trick in China, although there they are more likely to actually own the site of the human rights or Tibetan independence group in question. in the case of Belarus, the government doesn't care about things like plausible deniability as much as it does ensuring that scheme continues operating, so they used the ISP instead.

There is some response public, online as well, from Russia.

Anyway people here is friendly, don't speak english (but they try to help you in case you ask for), it's hot in summer (especially if your going to visit southern regions), the major cities will be almost empty bacause of vacations.
If you can visit small cities and towns, there are a lot of gems apart of the major cities (Rome, Florence, Venice), really a lot. Those smaller towns are usually easier places to visit, have good time, enjoy food.


Socially speaking the southern you'll go the harder will be to drive (in case you'll have to) and the easier will be to interact with people. Every region has its own food specialities, stay away from restaurants that have photos in the menus (tourist traps). You can drink alcool wherever you like (streets, bars etc.) but for us in not common to eat in the streets (general rule, not apply to gelato, pizza etc.) but nonody will tell you anything about. We usually don't tip (in tourists places the waiters are used to get tips) but if you're inclined go ahead.

Still speaking about food, try regional specialities. Past and pizza are everywhere, but there is so much variety around that you'll be able to eat a completely different thing every meal of your staying, I bet you. ""I'm dying of hunger"" is ""Sto morendo di fame!""

 Nobody here wants wars and violence and we all like to be optimistic about the future. But no amount of wishful thinking is going to change centuries old attitudes in other countries. 

 Please let me ask, have militias and national tensions ceased to exist in the Balkans? The obvious answer is no. Not yet. Even if one of the disputes has been settled through diplomacy. Btw, diplomacy doesn't rule out war. 

 Is even the UN security council unanimous on the independence of Kosovo? No.

 Have the UN peacekeeping forces/Kosovo interim government (UNMIK) left the area? No they are still there. 

 Why do you think they are there if there is no chance for violent clashes and all this talk is utter bullshit?

 The question of whether a war might break out in the future cannot be answered by a simple yes or no. At this point in time, my opinion is we cannot rule out the possibility. The general attitude and efforts in the region point out a will to solve disputes within world forums and through diplomacy. So war is, like i said in my first post, unlikely. But with so many open fronts (i haven't mentioned all of them) no sane person with even a limited knowledge of history (like me) can rule out the possibility.

true,miramarco,altro,,"Hi there! Here's some random advice:

* **Restaurants.** You will be charged a *coperto* (a cover charge). This fee is usually listed in the menus and should not be more than few euros. Tipping (the *mancia*) is non mandatory and is done to show appreciation for a particularly good service. Doggy bags are non-existent. Cafés and restaurants can not serve you tap water, but bottled water.

* **Eating.** My suggestion is to look out for local dishes. You can easily look them up on the Internet (or just ask here!). Spaghetti are commonly eaten with no spoon, even though some restaurants do serve it along with the dish. Also, know the basic rules when ordering wine -- red wine with meat, white wine with fish. A typical way to end lunch is drinking an espresso: just ask the waiter for *un caffè*. For some fast food, try some snack bars. Some examples are the *paninoteca*, *tavola calda*, *piadineria*, *pizza al taglio*, etc. Don't forget the gelato! *Gelaterie* are very common in all Italy and are worth checking out.

* **Breakfast.** Even though hotels and the like usually serve a so-called continental breakfast, the *colazione all'italiana* (Italian-style breakfast) consists of just cappuccino and *cornetto* (croissant). It will be served in every café (*bar*). Never, ever drink cappuccino after 11 a.m. -- that's probably the biggest faux pas you can do in Italy.

* **Pizza.** Every Italian will say that our pizza is far better than the American style pizza. Don't even try arguing :) Italian pizza is thinner than the American and comes in standard types. Every pizzeria has the complete list in their menus and they available to prepare some custom ones. Almost all pizzas have tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese (when they have no tomato sauce, they're called *pizze bianche*). The ""mozzarella di bufala"" is a special kind of mozzarella and is more expensive.

* **Shops.** Most shops open at 9 a.m. and close at 6-7 p.m. Some also close during lunchtime. This can also apply to bus/train ticket vendors. Almost all shops close on Sundays, so make sure you have everything you need the day before. Also, the standard vacation month is August, so small cities will be eerily void of people. Shops open 24/7 are very, very rare.

* **Clothing.** Clothing rules are not so strict, except on formal circumstances (e.g. business and work). Just wear anything that does not make you stand out among the crowd, and you'll be fine. Remember to cover your shoulders and knees and take off any hats when entering churches.

* **Language and conversation.** English is not commonly spoken. If you need to talk to someone in English, try with young people. Older people might know a bit of French. It will be very appreciated if you try to speak Italian -- people are very proud of their language here. Some topics to avoid are: salaries, politics, fascism. Use the courtesy form when talking to strangers (*lei*: third person singular, feminine), but the usage of *tu* (""you"") is common among young people, even if they don't know each other.

* **Gestures.** The cheek-kiss between friends, relatives and close acquaintances is far more common in Italy than Canada and America. It probably will make you uncomfortable the first times -- just go along with it. In formal circumstances, handshakes are given instead.

* **Traffic.** Some people just don't follow the rules. Be careful when driving and crossing the road. Seat belts are mandatory. Don't drink and drive -- a glass of wine or beer before driving is tolerated though.

* **Railway.** Our railway system sucks. Full stop. Trains are often late, dirty and overcrowded. Also, it's also becoming a routine for the railway personnel to come out on strike quite often (exp. from Fridays to Sundays). Tickets must be stamped at the yellow ticket machines you can see in railway stations. Look for a functioning one and punch your ticket -- if it doesn't print anything, just write the station you're leaving from and the current date and hour (write them at the top of the ticket) and make a small tear on the side of the ticket. Otherwise, you must look for the ticket inspector as soon as you enter the train.

* **Safety.** The same cautionary advice from all the world apply in Italy. Don't make yourself an easy target for pickpockets and scammers. Don't wear expensive jewels or watches. If something approaches you with an offer, it is likely to be a scam. Be very aware of crowded means of transportation: buses, trains, subway cars. If you're a woman, be careful during the nights and, if possible, go out with someone you trust.

Also, remember -- if you ever need any advice, you can also come here to ask. We'll be more than glad to help you!",0,1310726551,null,0,false,0,c25se2h,t3_iq4ji,t1_c25se2h,t3_iq4ji,1427352138,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

As other redditors said, in southern italy people are more friendly - but watch out, because sometimes they're friendly up to the point where they scam you (but this is true everywhere). If you need directions, you can try your luck with law enforcers, but there's a good chanche they won't speak english. Your best bet would be trying with younger people - keep in mind that mos teenagers only speak some brutalized, butchered kind of semi-english.

As for the food, try to avoid the obvious tourist trap - restaurants on the main street, etc - because they usually sell mediocre food at incredible prices. You can easily live in italy eating snacks (Pizza, Focaccia, Piadine, Panzerotti, Panini...), but should you find yourself desperatly craving italian food, you can surely find some good restaurant.

Travelling by car: why would you do that. No, i'm jesting. But seriously: cities are hell if you're driving a car, because for italian people behind the weel there are no laws, just suggestion from the government. Be careful whatever you do, and learn to juggle with roundabouts.

Travelling by train: avoid at all cost Regional trains, because they make a metric fuckton of stops and are usually old, smelly and without a/c. Intercity trains are what you should use if you're on a budget, while eurostar/eurocity/frecciarossa are the best train italy can offer.

*That*, in turn, was certainly inspired by the US Senate (which, before the 17th Amendment, was only indirectly elected, as the Bundesrat and Council of the EU), although with a more sensible apportionment (Prussia in 1871, and Germany/France/Italy in the EU certainly wouldn't have allowed for equal weight for all countries like the delegates of small states managed to carry over in the Philadelphia Convention for the US).  It's also true that in 1957/1967, any name like ""Senate"" would have sounded ridiculous for the Council of the European Community (which became Council of the EU in 1993).

So I agree that the European Council is the one that should have been named differently (and even if they really wanted to reuse the word ""Council"", they could have found some qualifier more useful than ""European"": e.g., ""Executive Council"", ""Council of Heads"", ""Planning Council"" of, failing anything else, ""General Council"" would already have been an improvement).",0,1310735478,null,0,false,0,c25sukj,t3_iq0iw,t1_c25sukj,t1_c25r7z1,1427352353,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

The biggest problem I've ever had with taxis in Paris is that you can't get them when you need them; but from the airport that won't be a problem. 

They don't necessarily know all the streets but they will have a map and try to take you the best way. On the inside window of every cab are instructions in English on how to make a complaint and the taxi authority responds very quickly to complaints; maybe this is one reason complaints are rare. A taxi driver in Paris now has to pass an English test to get his taxi license so they should be able to understand basic instructions. You might want to have the address written out before you start. Drivers are allowed to charge a fee for coming from the airport and for extra bags; this is clearly explained on the taxi decal on the inside window.

Advice for your vegetarian: Paris isn't an easy city for a vegetarian. If you decide to go for a nice meal somewhere, my advice is to tell the waiter that you are a vegetarian for religious reasons (they respect this more) but that you love good food, and ask if the chef will make something specially for you. Most good chefs will try to give you something nice and I have had good luck with this (I have a vegetarian in the family).

Also, there is a city in North Dakota named after the chancellor in the 1870's, but I think it was more a kind of publicity stunt than genuine German-American friendship of any kind.)

But still, as far as I know, the US were the first to take bicameralism and make it into an instrument of federalism, with the lower house of parliament representing (broadly speaking) the people and the upper house representing the states.

&gt; Nobody here wants wars and violence and we all like to be optimistic about the future. But no amount of wishful thinking is going to change centuries old attitudes in other countries.

I presume by ""other countries"" you meant the balkan countries/nations? Am I right? Well, that's so hypocritical. Take Germany for example. The idea of the great germany from the baltic to adriatic was alive for centuries and it almost came true during WW2, but today's germans what to live in peace and harmony with other nations. 

&gt; Please let me ask, have militias and national tensions ceased to exist in the Balkans? The obvious answer is no. 

Please name one of your imaginary militia that has caused any trouble in the last 15 years? 

&gt; Even if one of the disputes has been settled through diplomacy. Btw, diplomacy doesn't rule out war.
&gt; Is even the UN security council unanimous on the independence of Kosovo? No.
&gt; Have the UN peacekeeping forces/Kosovo interim government (UNMIK) left the area? No they are still there.

Making assumptions and generalizations about the whole balkan terriory based on a single regional dispute like Kosovo is also a load of bollocks. There is a huge difference between inner balkan relations and this rather small regional dispute. 

The presence of a peacekeeping force does not condition a war like state or any future conflicts. My very good friend is currently serving in his second term as a peace keeping servicemen in kosovo and he does not recall any major conflicts or tensions whatsoever. All they do is maintain a regular presence with the locals and help them out a bit with day to day stuff.

&gt; Why do you think they are there if there is no chance for violent clashes and all this talk is utter bullshit?
&gt; The question of whether a war might break out in the future cannot be answered by a simple yes or no. At this point in time, my opinion is we cannot rule out the possibility. The general attitude and efforts in the region point out a will to solve disputes within world forums and through diplomacy. So war is, like i said in my first post, unlikely. But with so many open fronts (i haven't mentioned all of them) no sane person with even a limited knowledge of history (like me) can rule out the possibility.

IMHO you're just being ignorant by even suggesting that a war might break out in the balkans. This part of europe suffers from such unfair stigmatization. It took a long time to heal the wounds of the 90s war and I presume it will take an even longer time to convince and educate the rest of the europe that the days of balkan militarism are over.",0,1310761366,null,0,false,0,c25vtbs,t3_ioc3q,t1_c25vtbs,t1_c25s6g7,1427353751,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

After your arrival you have to register to the City Hall (I guess in Berlin each Bezirk has its own City Hall) within maximum three months from the date of your arrival. I don't know if this applies to German citizens upon their arrival in a new city or Kreis (county) or Land, but I know for sure it applies to foreigners. I don't know if this applied to me because I came from one of those countries that are in the EU but do not have full rights as the others, or not.
Also, I have no clue about what rules apply to your wife, since she's not coming from an EU country. Does she have an Italian passport? 

Anyway, I'm a web developer. I started by registering to the Rathaus (City Hall) of the place I live in (and received an Anmeldebestätigung). They communicate with the Finanzamt your arrival. Shortly after, you will receive an ID number from the Finanzamt. This is NOT your Steuernummer (tax number), but your personal ID number that will ""follow"" you all along your stay in the Bundesrepublik.

Shortly after this, I went again to the City Hall and said I wanted to become a freelancer. I choose ""Programmieren, Verkauf von Software, Beratung und Service im Bereich Software"" (""Programming, selling software, counseling and service related to software"") as my field of activity, I paid 5 euros, waited 5 minutes and I received a ""Gewerbeanmeldung"" (the paper that describes my status and proves I registered the Gewerbe).

Three months after I registered to the City Hall (which is the standard period), I was invited to go to the Landratsamt in the capital city of the Kreis I live in, to the Ausländeramt (the authority for foreigners). They required me to go there with the following papers:

* proof of income (which would be the Gewerbeanmeldung);

* health insurance (this is a whole other complicated topic, especially for a foreign freelancer and it wasn't easy for me to obtain a cheap(er) one);

* personal identification papers (Passport).

There, an officer will be assigned to you. They are assigned in the alphabetical order of the family names of the foreigners, so S/He will handle both you and your wife if she took your name.

My officer took a short look at all the papers I came with (Gewerbeanmeldung, the papers I had already received from the Finanzamt, the insurance policy, my passport) and she gave me the Freizugigkeitbescheinigung (the certificate for free circulation), a paper that states that you are in their records and that you are allowed to freely move and live anywhere throughout Germany. This paper specifies that I'm an EU citizen, so - again - I don't know if this applies to your wife or not.

After one year or so, I changed address within Germany. You need to declare this to the Rathaus. When I did, they gave me not a paper about Addresseänderung (change of address), but a Aufenthaltsbescheinigung (certificate of residence). I don't know anything about the legal value of this new paper.

Getting back to the taxes:

After a while (I don't remember how long, but in the order of months) since I registered my freelancing stuff, I finally received a new paper from the Finanzamt with my Steuernummer. This will be your taxes number all along your work as a freelancer in Germany. Please note that, if I don't specify otherwise, all these papers come automatically to the address you declared.

You will not be required to pay taxes for incomes below EUR 8000 a year, but you will still have to declare everything. If you get over this amount, but under EUR 18.500, then you will pay a low amount. If you get over 18.500, you will pay a lot more taxes and you will have to declare yourself as a VAT payer and you will receive another ID (starting with DE followed by a few digits). If you stay under this income amount, you will not have to declare and invoice any VAT.

Regardless of this, as others have said, you will have to fill in the incredibly complex and time consuming Einkommenssteuererklärung. Even if I can speak a bit of German and I understand others, I am absolutely not able to understand the 20+ letters long words in that form, not even with the help of a dictionary. So, a Steuerberater is absolutely necessary.

I was lucky to find a guy that speaks very good English. He handled all things for me and made sure I don't forget about deducting anything that could be considered as helping me in my profession (computers, office supplies, office furniture, the electrical bill etc) - I'm working from home.

BTW: Strong advice: get yourselves a three-rooms apartment! Try to make sure that one of these rooms is accessible somehow without having to cross any other, except the entrance lobby. Make that room your work office. This will help you deduct part of the rent, which is amazing. I didn't know about this and now it's too late. :(

If you get a Berater, he should handle absolutely everything for you. You will just need to keep track of every income that you make (write and keep invoices, contracts etc), but also of every expense that you make and that would help you with your work.

With my (not so thick, if you know what I mean) taxes file, I had to pay around EUR 200 (the counseling, that is).

If you have this Berater, then you will be allowed to send your taxes until the end of the year and not until the 31st of May. And as far as I understood, the Greens want now to pass a law that would allow you to send your taxes file even the next year.
However, your FIRST tax declaration will have to be sent within the normal term - until the 31st of May. With it, the Berater will send some other paper that states that he's your designed counselor and then the Finanzamt will not ask for your declaration until the end of the year.

 Sure, they do for the most part. But Germans and their history has nothing to do with the Balkan nations and their history. The fact Germany is not a hostile nation to its neighbours does not negate the fact things in the Balkans are not like a fairytale. 

 As for militias, you want one that has caused problems in the last 15 years? How about UCC? An arm of UCK. They have not exactly attacked civilians or invaded (if a war breaks out in the region i doubt its going to be like in tv) but at least in Greece where i'm from a lot of safehouses have been discovered loaded with ammunition. Thousands of kalashnikovs. Just the other day the police caught some armed robbers and discoverd UCK flags and material in their safehouse. It is speculated a big part of the Albanian mafia is closely linked to UCK/UCC type militias and are currently plundering and not directly fighting. Maybe you think this is okay and not something that causes trouble. I can't speak for what goes on in other countries in any great extent.

 But what about UCK themselves? A terrorist organisation with attoricities under its belt, that ""disbanded"" and supplies Kosovo with prime ministers... That is totally normal for a region that is looking to forget ethnic tensions and violence, no?

&gt;IMHO you're just being ignorant by even suggesting that a war might break out in the balkans.

 I wish you are right. My opinion is we cannot rule out the possibility. No way. The conditions do not permit us to do this. In addition we don't have the luxury to be complacent. Maybe you are educated and love peace, but there are thousands and thousands of people that lack education and are raised in an environment of hate, you can't ignore this.

 P.S. Ask your peacekeeper friend, what happens if all funding is cut tomorrow and they abandon Kosovo? How long until the first border village -either way- is attacked in some way?

 In the end it doesn't take too much to destabilise the Balkans, even if things are being kept in check right now. The problems are there, its not just some stigma from the past.

This is what Reddit is all about. And the German bureaucracy is really intricate, but - as opposed to the ones in our mother lands, it works properly for most of the time, without any bribery. ;)

&gt; Another question I have is regarding bank accounts,... I'm gonna need one and I'm not sure in what part of the whole process I will be qualified to open it and what will the requisites be.

Immediately after I opened the Gewerbe at the City Hall, I went to the bank (Volksbank in my case) with two papers: the registration I first made (Anmeldebestätigung) and the registration paper for the freelancing stuff (Gewerbeanmeldung), and with my passport, of course. With all these, I opened two accounts: a personal one and a company one. 

I don't know if this is a legal requirement, but I would suggest you do the same: the personal account will be for personal expenses and income (if any), and the most important one - the company account - will be for every income that you will get as a freelancer. When you go to the Steuerberater you will have to bring the Kontoauszüge (the account statements) for both of them, but he will take a very detailed look at the company account. Based on this, he will calculate your income, then deduct whatever expenses you can prove to have made for your work.

Side note: very important, if you guys are really married (with papers and everything), then you will get more tax deductions! I'm just living with my girlfriend and this makes our taxes to be higher. We're investigating the advantages of a domestic partnership registered to the authorities, it seems this can also bring deductions.

About insurance: As I said in my previous post, a health insurance is one of the prerequisites to get the free circulation paper. As far as I know, nobody living in Germany is allowed to stay without a health insurance of some sort, German or foreigner. So, you will have to do this. The problem is that you - as a freelancer (or as both freelancer and foreigner? - not sure) - are not able to get a state insurance (much cheaper). So, the only option remains the private insurance.

Private insurances in Germany are not cheap. The cheapest you can get come with somehow shitty coverage (of course), but at the Ausländeramt all they want to see is the insurance policy. They don't care about coverage. So, if you know that you both are healthy, then you can go this way.

However, the price of the insurance is extremely dependent on many things: your age, your disease history, your weight etc. My first insurance was something like 167 euros per month, while the insurance of another friend of mine with similar backgrounds was 275 euros a month, because of his age (40+) and weight (130kg+).

You can find insurance companies over the Internet. You may or may not have the luck to perfectly understand everything they write there, and you may or may not have the luck to find an insurance employee that knows English. You can also take a look at special websites that handle comparisons between different insurance companies, but I didn't use those (and unfortunately I didn't save any such links...). What I did was to find a broker over the Internet (it's much better, he will have to show you multiple options) and schedule a Termin (meeting). 

The guy didn't speak English, but he was German-Italian and due to my background (speaking French and begin Romanian - so, all Latin languages), I managed to bare a conversation with him. He set me for the cheapest of the cheapest insurances (167 euros a month), with the only one that accepted foreign (Romanian?) freelancers.

I didn't use that insurance for two years, not even to buy an Aspirin. However, they suddenly decided to raise my insurance price to almost 300 euros without changing any of my benefits. This seems to be legal in Germany as compared to the States, for example. They say they insure a ""rotation"" of customers in between insurance companies... I call this bullshit. You see, not everything is nice and shinny in good old Deutschland, so you will definitely get burned with this sooner or later...

Anyway... the same brokerage company contacted me before I got the chance to contact them myself. The Italian guy had left the company, but as per my request I was put in contact with another broker lady there, who speaks perfect English. I told her that we should find something else and she found something for around 180 euros, with a different company. She handled everything, like breaking the other contract officially, signing the new one etc. All these without any need for a person to person meeting, she was really professional. When (if) you will want the details of this person, PM me.

Sorry for yet another wall of text... :) Hope it helps. Ask more if you want. And... learn the goddamn German language if you didn't already... While you can definitely find your way with English, you will see that so many shinny, nice doors remain closed for you because of this. Also, I would say that the percentage of projects that you may find as a freelancer and that require English as the first language is something in between 1 and 5%. However, almost all the rest require German and good knowledge of English. If you think you will have the time to learn it while working on your projects, well then you're wrong. I didn't.

After the war ""black education"" was abolished and more liberal views were practised. During the 1960-1980 periods many families raised their children very progressive, one term that comes to my mind is ""laissez-faire"""" (translates roughly to ""do what you want"").

Today, the ""laissez-faire""-style is outdated, most families raise their kids flexible (certain set of rules, mutual respect, a child is allowed to behave like a child).

 I also object to the section showing infrastructure upon which loan money was spent. It is certainly better to spend borrowed money on infrastructure than on ouzo, but the money was spent on a lot more than a few showpiece infrastructure projects and to suggest otherwise is disingenuous

My frustration is not specifically where the money went, however, bridges, ouzo, inefficiency, corruption, economic investments, benefits, I don’t care. That is for the people of Greece to care about. I care that Greece [lied to join the Euro](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/8580720/Timeline-of-a-crisis-how-Greeces-tragedy-unfolded.html) (they concealed how bad their debts were), and then once they were in, they used the fact that their default would bring down the entire Euro zone, and that the other members would be forced to bail them out, to borrow massive amounts of money in both quantities and at rates that they could never have gotten without the implied backing of Germany, France and other countries who had no say in the matter. The hope was that by bringing in all this money, the Greek economy would be so buoyed that it would grow until it was at the level at which the country could be prosperous and actually pay back the debt. 

This did not happen, mostly because Greece’s economy was not up to it but also because of massive government mismanagement, inefficiencies and even corruption and widespread tax dodging by citizens. Now those same countries to which Greece first lied, and then whose better credit Greece used to get the loans, are now on the hook to bail Greece out or damage their own currency and economy, while Greeks themselves are in the news protesting against the injustice of it all. That is what frustrates me, and no amount of videos filled with flawed arguments will change that, no matter how lovely the bridges.

Not true. This is just another manifestation of the worst enemy of Greece, which is, of course, Greece itself. And I guess some media ball dropping. All in all a common misconception.

In 2004, a little while before the Olympic Games, we had a change of government. The centrist/socialist party PASOK was voted off, and the right/conservative ND was voted in. ND (as is ""tradition"") wanted to downplay any achievements of the previous government (for the past 9 years). For this, they ordered an audit of the economics of the state, and ""found out"" that the previous government had under-reported some financial figures. Of course they made quite a show of this, but the truth is that, while with the *2004 methods*, Greece had a deficit of *3.4%* (happy times...), with the *1999 methods*, it had *less than the required 3%*. The ""funny"" thing is that Eurostat has now reverted to the the 1999 methods to calculate deficits.

Yet that is what exactly what happened. Of course you use accounting tricks if you want to lie in this case - you don't have a number 100 and say it was 50 - this is easily disproved.

In any case, the actual change indeed was very specific: Greece used the ESA79 methodology when reporting data for 1997-1999, under which it had a deficit of 1.8%, when using the ESA95 methodology it should have been 3.4%. The point is that in 1997-1999, the current accounting practice was indeed ESA79, while in 2004 the practice was ESA95.

No, you got that backwards. At the time (1999) ESA79 was the methodology that was supposed to be used. In 2004 ESA95 was in place, but it was not supposed to be in place in 1999. Greece didn't lie to join the Euro zone. With 2004 methodologies (when the reporting - from the Greek government - took place), Greece wasn't supposed to join the Euro zone. With 1999 methodologies (when the actual criteria were calculated) Greece made it (and with room to spare in fact). The lie was the reporting from the Greek government, which was done to discredit the previous government. As I said before, the worst enemy of Greece is Greece itself.

As to ""borrowing more money that we should"", it wasn't really unfeasible. If we hadn't voted for a government that did absolutely nothing for 5 years, and that only planned for the ""happy case"", we probably would have been in better state than a lot of countries in Europe right now. We did major infrastructure work up to 2004 (thinly disguised as works for the Olympics - nothing better to unite the Greeks than a common goal, and nothing harder to find), which was then left to rot because the government changed (and it didn't want to recognize that the previous government was anything but the scum of the Earth).

The ""unfairness"" in the whole deal is due to the fact that we are indeed one of the poorest nations in Europe. At least there seems to be a large enough gap between middle and upper class to prompt such a response, I'm not entirely sure. I can't really explain how so many people could afford so many Porsche Cayennes (well maybe I can), although there's quite a lot less of them on the streets nowadays (due mainly to the gas prices). The crux of the problem is that the only ones that pay all the time are the ones with a salary (because it's easier to tax at the source). We never seem to be able to tax the rich...

In other words: ***the current diversity of languages throughout the world is a consequence of geographic incommunication and the ancient lack of telecommunication technologies for keeping a single standard; it is not a consequence of any human preference or purpose about language diversification, or a solution to any sort of problem***.

You can almost notice the linguistic differences, not from country to country, but from neighborhood to neighborhood.

Err, no.  Every nearly every member of a national research laboratory in France is also attached to a university.  For example, many INRIA Saclay or INRIA Racquencort members are also attached to one of the big Paris universities like Ecole Polytechnique and Paris 7 Diderot.  It's routine when reading a publication written by a French researcher to see their institution given as INRIA and Ecole Polytechnique, for instance.

For example, [here's a research team I picked](http://proval.lri.fr/members.en.html).  Click a name at random and notice they *all* have dual relationships with an INRIA project and also a French university.

However, this also marks a massive difference between the UK and US because the United States also has the same concept of national laboratories like Los Alamos, and research institutions unattached to any university like the IAS, yet US universities are still coming out on top whilst French ones aren't.

It seems that it's hard for the MSM to hold two different thoughts in their head at any one time.

By 2021 it is possible/probably that Scotland will be independent; now those of us who favour Scottish independence have long been (mis)informed by the unionists that we would not automatically be accepted into the EU. In fact, we are told, we would have to apply for membership - and that that would not be guaranteed.

However, they fail to see the natural extension of their argument - that Scotland was not accepted into the EU, it was the UK, therefore Scotland would have to make its own application after independence - that the rump-UK would also be in the same position - as it is no longer the same entity that was admitted in the 70's.

Now if their reasoning holds water - and isn't just the usual cynical scaremongering and misinformation that the unionists engage in - and Scotland has to apply for membership, I see no reason that, by extension, *the rump UK would not be in the same position and also* have to reapply. Who is to say that the EU would want to readmit a bankrupt, quarrelsome member such as the rump UK. Maybe the rump UK would get the Gaullist FU that Britain received for the decades prior to the UK's admission.

true,minnabruna,ASTR,Austria,"So what you are saying is that the Greek government did not lie about its debt to join the Euro it lied about lying? I am not sure how much I agree with this version of events, but either way does not help efforts to attract international support.

The loans policy was a gamble. I do have sympathy on one count - you are right, Greece is poor, and I can see how it would be hard to resist the temptation to borrow as much as possible to change this. That sympathy is not enough to erase my frustration however. Greece is poor. Greece was poor. Greece on its own, outside of the Euro zone, was too poor to convince lenders and investors to give them nearly as much money as they did. Greece only could because of the consequences for other countries were it to default, countries not party to the borrowing decisions and not benefiting from the money raised. If Greece were to default, it would damage the entire Euro Zone. Therefore, the major Euro economies would have no choice but to support Greece. Lenders only believed it safe to lend this much money to Greece because of this implied, involuntary support from other countries. Greece itself was never qualified. 

Now Greece can't pay and those countries are on the hook. It is a form of legal extortion “pay our debts or we’ll take your currency down with us.”  The fact that the intentions of the Greek government were more honest than a mobster’s does not change the core situation; other countries are on the hook for Greece’s mistakes, and Greece could only make those mistakes because they were able to leverage those countries’ involuntary billions. Even if I have some sympathy for the situation which caused Greece to take on so much debt, my current sympathy for the uninvolved parties who are now stuck with the bill is greater. 

Defending  tax evasion and poor fiscal  management as something that happens in all countries is misleading. Yes, all countries suffer from tax evasion. But not as Greece does. According to the Financial Times, more than 25% of Greece’s GDP was unreported and untaxed as of 2007, as compared to 14.6% in Germany, 11.8% in France and 7.2% in the US. The [New Yorker reports]( http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2011/07/11/110711ta_talk_surowiecki) that in 2010 that number was up to 27.5%. According to [the same FT article]( http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704182004575055473233674214.html), poor Greece, so in need of funds, could recoup an addition 20.5 billion USD a year if tax evasion could be addressed. That is a little more than 6% of Greece’s GDP and a full 40% of the Greek government’s annual revenues.  At the same time, what money is collected could be used a lot more efficiently. If does not help your efforts to change international opinion to be favor of Greece when the BBC World Service reports that a cleaner/janitor in the Finance Ministry makes more than managers in other ministries lacking such direct access to budgets. Corruption is also a problem. According to a Trasnparency International Report on Greece titled [Corruption: A Root Cause of the Crisis](http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2011/tackling_corruption_in_greece) bribery alone cost Greece 837 million USD in 2010. According to [TI’s larger survey on Greek corruption]( http://en.transparency.gr/Press.aspx?page=34&amp;code=PressRelease&amp;article=295) hospitals and taxes were the two most corrupted service types. Overall, TI ranks Greece 78th in global honesty, between Columbia and Lesotho in its global corruption rankings, and ranks Greece as the most corruption country of the 30 countries included in its ""European Union and Western Europe"" section. There are a lot of wasteful and illegal financial activities is Greece, ones that, if eliminated, would go a long way towards paying Greece’s debt, and constructively supporting the growth of the economy of Greece, if only the government were able to control them and the people able to avoid doing them.

It all changed for Britain when turbo conservatives in 80s thought the European Union is becoming too socialist and was a threat to the Cold War. Neoliberal shitload of crap that got major ""repost"" after 9/11 and the War on Terrorism.

2009 European election results (Scotland) UKIP come 6th with 5.2% of the vote.

Oh look, stastical evidence of a difference in attitude between Scotland and the rest of the UK. UKIP are not a significant party in Scotland, and linking to a youtube video of Farage to illustrate a uniform xenophobia and inferiority complex in Britain is ridiculous.

You also talk about British Euroscepticism stemming from ultra conservatism under Thatcher in the 80s. In Scotland however, the Conservatives, particularly under Thatcher, are despised. Scottish votes have gone to (ostensibly) left-leaning parties since the 50s; any Euroscepticism would not likely to be related to fear of socialism.


Scotland has different views to England (can't speak for rest of UK) generally on a few topics, Europe included, so you should stop spewing shite. Particularly about simultaneous inferiority and superiority complexes, that's just confusing.
