So from what I've seen in Germany and read about, the Universities USED to be free, but no longer are. However many are INCREDIBLY cheap compared to the US. (My girlfriend pays 500 euro per semester for her tuition) There may still be some free ones around, however I've not yet seen that myself.

Also, most undergraduate level degree programs are taught in German and you would have to qualify at an acceptable level of understanding of the language before you can begin. (German placement tests) An interesting thing to me was that most of the graduate level courses were taught in English.

All the other questions I'm unable to offer any input for. I hope that helps at least a little!

As far as learning German I would say start immediately if this is a goal you're passionate about. You get as much out of a language as you put into it. It is always MUCH easier though to learn the language in the country of origin.

There's a lot you can do where you are at. One thing I've done is started putting post it notes on EVERYTHING in my room with the word translations into the languages I'm studying. (German, Japanese, and Bulgarian right now. Sometime my brain feels like it's going to die.) Also when you have idle time, think or talk to yourself about anything and everything in the language as much as you can. There's all kinds of videos and GOOD music out there too. Best thing is no matter where you are, immerse yourself in the language in every way possible. 

There are a LOT of German courses there. Some are inexpensive but I'm not sure about the quality of them. I've heard that the Goethe Institute is a very good one, however it's also pricey because of that I believe.

I personally, am not of fan of Rosetta stone. Mostly because I need to learn the rules to really get a good grasp on the languages, and Rosetta Stone just seems to be learning by repetition. While it may work for some, it is mostly just annoying to me.

Picking up German on the side and expecting to do well in German Uni is very ambitious. You should know that German schools are much much harder than your average English speaking University.

I was born and raised in Germany and I started in an American School and switched to German school in 7th grade after my father retired from the Army. After being a straight A student my whole life, my grades dropped dramatically in German school even though I already understood German very well, but was terrible (and still am) in Grammar.

After finishing German school I was not eligible to go to Uni because I didn't do Gymnasium so I did an apprenticeship and then went to American Uni which in my opinion was mostly easier than 10th grade German school.

If the courses are taught in German and you aren't a native speaker you will definitely struggle. German is a very difficult language to learn but since you have some prior experience to it, you might find it manageable. If your friend has no prior experience with German, it will take him at least a year to have enough knowledge of the language to even understand what is going on at University level.

Looking back and after hearing stories from cousins and friends that did go to German Uni, I don't think I could achieve anywhere near as much success in a German Uni as I did in the English speaking ones I went to.

Yes. Sorry, had too.

More seriously though, all of it applies. The language creates the first barrier but most Germans speak English nowadays, you'll only find a few in the older generation or the less educated ""Hauptschueler"" are lacking in the English department. Again, if the courses are in German, don't expect to understand much with only basic German skills, we have some very long words.

The workload is also ridiculous compared to my experience in English schools. I didn't know what studying was until German school. It also took me ages to learn the whole process of studying for a test which influenced my grades negatively.

And along with the higher workloads come higher expectations, but in University this may not apply, I am not sure how strict they are with attendance, but my cousin, who is pretty smart couldn't handle it, so he went to American Uni (as a 100% German) instead and laughed at the comparison.

Sorry about the negativity, but that's another thing you must learn, we Germans are pessimists. Americans always say: ""Hope for the best."" Germans always say: ""Prepare for the worst.""

Mostly depends if conservatives or left leaning parties are in charge. Mostly ranges from an administration fee (state wide public transportation ticket included) around 200‚Ç¨ to additional tuition of 500‚Ç¨. Compared to the us it is cheap. I myself pay around 780‚Ç¨ per semester. Am I right that you want to get into medicine? Well we don't have something like a pre-med degree here. Same applies for law...you go directly to med-School and don't have to waist time on some premed degree. But med-school is harder to get into. Friend of mine had an 1.2 gpa (1.0 Best) and could only into one far away from her hometown where she didn't wanted to go. Also most classes are not mandatory to attend every lecture. Nobody forces you to be there. That's a problem for many students because they rather sleep than being in school at 8 am. And nobody tells you what and when to study. I am studying civil and environmental engineering and all I have is exams at the end of the semester and no tests or midterms in-between. Being lazy is pretty easy. 

The wintersemester starts in october am I right that your semester ends in juli or something? You can have a 3 month vacation visa and enroll in the goethe institute or something like that to learn German. Germans will try to speak English to you as soon they notice you are an English speaker but just tell them you want to speak German and they will do it.

true,freibooter,null,null,"I think I can give you some advice. My wife is from the US and studied in Germany. She just finished her studies and started a well paying job as a teacher at a German University this month.

1. The student visa shouldn't be a problem at all. If you need more than 4 years, it's very easy to get it extended - my wife studied for 7 years. Essentially you have to visit your local foreigner's bureau (""Ausl√§nderamt"") roughly every semester and pay a small fee to get it extended (20-30 Euros depending on the state you'll be living in). The one thing you have to prove is that you can afford to stay in Germany for the next semester; either by having a certain amount of money in your bank account or with an informal letter by a family member telling them that they are going to support you financially over the next couple of months - I think the sum in question is roughly 2000-3000 Euros per semester for all your living expenses - for food, housing, tuition which is a somewhat realistic figure if you're living a simple lifestyle.

2. Tuition varies from state to state. Some states have introduced tuitions (no more than 500 Euros), some did but have since abolished them again (Hessen, for example). In addition to that there is a fee of roughly 200 Euros varying from University to University per semester. This usually includes _free_ use of all public transportation in a huge area around your University. Public transportation in Germany is stellar and almost everything can be done with it, so you don't have to worry about a car, driver's license etc. ... all of which can be terrible expensive. Gas is at roughly 9 USD per gallon here at the moment, if you can't transfer your current driver's license (depends on the state you're from) a German one would cost roughly 2000 Euros, tax and insurance of your vehicle wouldn't be cheap either.

3. You will be allowed to work 45 full days or 90 half days per year (I think) on your student visa. That isn't terribly much, but nobody will come after you for doing the odd undeclared job (like teaching English to your fellow students etc.). If you look for work, you will usually find it. The job market has recovered quite well from the recent global crisis.

4. Learn the language as soon as you can, it's pretty hard if compared to English. My wife still struggles with it on occasion, even after 10 years in Germany. However, almost all Germans speak English, most will gladly practice their English as soon as they see that you're not a native speaker.
That won't help you all that terribly much in a class taught by Germans for Germans, though. There are Universities and studies where at least parts of the curriculum are taught in English. Still, I recommend learning the language as soon and as well as you can.

5. There are no typical US-style dorms here, room-mates (as in sharing the same room) are essentially unheard of. You'll have to find and pay for your own housing and other living expenses. A tiny room in one of a local ""Studentenwohnheim"" starts around 200‚Ç¨ per month, but this also highly varies by region (smaller towns are cheaper than bigger ones, former East German states are cheaper than the ones in the west).

6. If money is an issue, and I assume it is, stay far away from cities like Munich (crazy expensive), Hamburg, Frankfurt am Main and several others. Studying in Berlin however, can be surprisingly affordable (all regarding housing and living expenses).

7. Books aren't as expensive as in the US and usually there are much less mandatory purchases.

8. (Almost?) all Universities have special departments for foreign students. Call them up (really cheap via Skype for example), ask your questions, most will gladly help you.

9. There are fraternities offering very cheap housing to (usually male) students. Be _VERY_ careful before joining one, do extensive background checks and do _not_ rely on information provided by their members. Not all fraternities are bad, but there are some pretty archaic ones (usually the ones with the most tempting offers) and being a member of a fraternity is not as well respected as they want you to believe.

10. You will not have to worry about changing your diet all that much. German students eat almost the same crap as American students. I'm just dipping some fake Oreos in milk (because real ones are expensive).
But the good news is that food in Germany is usually very affordable and it's even easy to maintain a somewhat healthy diet on a budget.

So if there was a break from the Eurozone, a re-introduction of a devalued Drachma and a general debt default, many Greek citizens will see their savings and retirement funds wiped out.

To be honest, Greece should never have been allowed to join the Eurozone until its own debt levels were under control.

It appears as though [Acquis Communautaire](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Community_acquis) analysis was too lenient.

true,temujin64,IREL,Poblacht na h√âireann,"Hold on a sec. Coming from Ireland I can honestly say that you obviously don't know why Ireland is being bailed out.

Before this recession Ireland had one of the lowest rates of debt in the EU. We were an impoverished country for our entire history until the '90s and borrowed heavily in order to build our economy. Just before the crash, we had almost paid it off... almost. We had something like over 10 consecutive surpluses and we used all that money to pay back our loans.

What happened to us is that while the public coffers were being managed very effectively, our banks were running amok lending incredible amounts of money to anyone (which they borrowed from reckless French and German banks).

Eventually our banking system was on the brink of an Iceland-like collapse and so we agreed to guarantee their debts. But that's when it got ugly. When the guarantee was issued the banks didn't say how much they owed and it turned out to be more than anyone could have ever imagined.

From there, the state was losing confidence in the markets and our credit rating took a thrashing. We thought we could hold out with some pretty vast reserves the state had saved away, but then the EU came knocking on our door. They coerced us into a bailout that was a raw deal for us in order to guarantee what they thought was potentially dangerous for the Euro.

Why did they force us into it? My view is this, the French and German banks were in trouble form lending too much to banks across the EU, including Irish banks. They owe a metric shit ton of money. The French and Germans were worried about that they'd have to bail their own banks out. Then they saw Ireland had bailed out its banks. They figured, if Ireland bails out its banks, which will in turn bail out the French and German banks that means France and Germany don't have to pick up the tab at all. Instead, they loan money to Ireland to essentially pay off their banks and then they make a long time profit on the loan for Ireland which was given at a very harsh rate. Not only do they get their banks bailed out for them, but they make money on it. Meanwhile poor old Ireland is ravaged back into poverty.

So it had nothing to do with recklessness on our part. The Irish people owe no one anything and yet we owe more than we can ever pay. The average Irish person who didn't owe a penny, who was never in personal debt suddenly can't find a job and has no future prospects in the country they were born and live in, so they are forced to emigrate. A perfect example would be me. I wanted to get a job in Ireland after college, but there aren't any, so I'm emigrating. I leave in July and won't step foot in this country for at least another 12 months.

TL;DR: Not Ireland's fault; had little debt before crash; its banks fucked up, not the national treasury; Irish people paying off German and French banks' debts for no good reason; Ireland suffers as a result, so I have to emigrate.

true,skythefly13,null,null,"Just spent last summer living in Napoli. Traveled to all the big cities minus basically Turin and Milano. I'm a college student and was in Naples for a study abroad program teaching swim lessons/lifeguarding on the American navy rec. sites.
One of my favorite cities BY FAR was Firenze. I highly suggest spending a lot of time there. It was clean, organized, easy to navigate, and has a ton of history. There are also a lot of Americans studying abroad there, which makes for fun night life. Never went to the top of the duomo due to the massive line there was. If you really need to go to the top, maybe go very early in the morning.
Roma is great. I went there two different weekends during the summer. It is amazing seeing the vatican after all of the publicity it gets, being movies, tv, or child abuse scandals...ha. St. peters basilica is unbelievable. I have never been the religious type, but it is a must see. The dress code is kind of funky and you have to wear clothes that cover up a lot, but I somehow managed to never get stopped wearing cargo shorts and just a t-shirt. No idea. Maybe it's mainly dress code for women. I also suggest doing the vatican museum. Bring a school ID if you can, it's about half the price. There are just so many things to see and do in Roma, it's crazy. It really is overwhelming. Also, the line for the coliseum can sometimes be massive I have heard, so go early in the morning if you plan to do that. Some of the negatives about this city: I had my credit card COPIED at a restaurant right next to the Trevi fountain. It was one of the only times I had used the card all summer and within 2 days they had spend 3400 dollars. Honestly, if you are around a tourist spot, ALWAYS be skeptical of what people are doing. Use cash, always know where your things are and just be careful. I went into the summer being absolutely paranoid of my things when traveling. Not so paranoid that I would wear my backpack on my stomach like an idiot, but I was definitely scared of my wallet getting jacked. Over time I relaxed a bit, and you probably will also, but just follow the rule of knowing where your things are at all times. In roma I also suggest the pantheon, and buy the all-day rail pass for I think 4 euro. Their underground subway system is really simple and was a breeze after traveling in Naples. Also...it can get damn hot there in the summer. Just grab a map and wander. One last thing, BRING A BIG WATER BOTTLE. Rome had the cleanest, best tasting water I had all summer. There are these fountains scattered throughout the city that continuously pour water all day. They look like they are disgusting fountains for eye candy, but just try it. Do not pay for water in rome.
Venezia....It's great. It absolutely poured there which is rare (I think). I would bring a nice camera for some good night shots if you can. We stayed out of the main part of venice which was about a 20 minute bus ride away. I had some of my favorite gelato right next to st. marc's square. If you have a group, try the gondola. If you are with one or two others, you might not want to fork out 80 euro for a boat ride. It is super, super easy to get lost in venice. It's a great experience knowing you are wandering through a place like venice with canals right next to the sidewalks (with no fences).
Pompeii...I honestly didn't go here. You will see that Naples is disgusting. Just wait for the difference between cities like florence and roma and going to Naples haha. There are just no words. Pompeii is hot, boring, lame, etc., and it wasn't worth it honestly. If you can, stay on the same train/railcar/wth it is and keep going to sorrento or the amalfi coast. The bus ride to the amalfi coast is one of the most beautiful drives in the world on a sunny day. Trust me. Skip pompeii and go to sorrento (home of limoncello) and then take the bus and stay overnight in a place like Positano. Just unbelievable. Look up pictures and you will see. It is hard to put into words how beautiful the amalfi coast is in person, especially comparing it to a dustbowl like pompeii. We also did the hike to the top of vesuvio...pretty cool. But it was still a hike to the top of a windy mountain which sucks knowing it's time to head back down the mountain. It's quite the trip down. 

I think that's about all. Sorry for the length. As you can tell I don't mind talking about my entire summer in Italy. It was quite the experience. Something to never forget. Have a good trip.

There are other countries in difficulty right now, Spain would be the next logical threat to the markets. Spain is too big of an economy to be bailed out, if the markets attack Spain next we are all in for a drive. So we can only hope that this ends here, in Portugal.

If I'm not mistaken Finland already agreed (couple weeks ago) to lend us the money. Which makes this whole video thing even more silly.

If Germany were to get out of the European Financial Stability fund it would leave the other countries exposed to this kind of economic attack, which in turn leaves the Euro exposed, the more the Euro goes down the more Germany's economy is worthless. It's a bad deal yes, being Europe's ""older brother"", why they signed up for this goes way beyond my economic/political knowledge.

true,leenucks,null,null,"&gt;**The finest hour**
&gt;
&gt;*February 2011, MAFIAA Lobbyists began a massive attack against the European Union.*
&gt;
&gt;*Defending the union were seeds and peers of The Pirate Bay along with the Telecomix, Anons, and the Pirate parties. The MAFIAA relied on an aggressive battle plan, utilizing modern communications such as radio and telefax to direct troops in the field. The Allies, for their part, assumed a defensive posture, just as they had done at the start of World Internets War of 2003, and in many cases still relied on irc.*
&gt;
&gt;*As a result, the MAFIAA blitzkrieg caught the Allies off-guard. MAFIAA's smooth talks and bribes against key players in the EU staged a surprise attack, then turned northward and soon surrounded the bulk of the EU headquarters in Belgium.*
&gt;
&gt;*After just a few weeks of battle, MAFIAA's armies had conquered the right, the left and the liberal parties.*
&gt;
&gt;I expect that the Battle of Internets is about to begin. Upon this battle depends the survival of an Uncensored civilization! Upon it depends our own free life, and the long continuity of our sites and our trackers. The whole fury and might of the enemy will very soon be turned on us.
&gt;
&gt;MAFIAA knows that they will have to break us in Brussels or lose the war. If we can stand up to them, all Europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands. But if we fail, then the whole world, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science.
&gt;
&gt;Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that if the free internets and its multitude of sites last for a thousand years, citizens will still say, This was their finest hour.
&gt;
&gt;Yours Winston Bay

There's also the problem that this totalitarian attitude is necessary to ensure the music/movie industries remain profitable (as they are some of the largest industries in the West). 

But the fundamental problem is the capitalist system that creates this situation where we cannot just distribute all the ""intellectual property"" freely. Just as the fetters of feudalism once withheld the industrial revolution, now the fetters of capitalism withhold the digital revolution, as they must make private profit on the goods they produce and so cannot utilise free distribution.

*Grimaces*. Please don't do the American thing of being loud and going on about how things are better in the US.

There are many Srilankans living and working in Paris, there's even a Srilankan enclave near Gard du Nord if you're looking for Srilankan food and products. Srilankans are seen here as friendly hardworking people, though sadly most Srilankans seem to be kitchen staff or nannies.

It is very unlikely you will have difficulties regarding racism. The French just think they're better than *everyone*. Nevertheless, they're pretty friendly when you get to know them. In a city where there are millions of tourist visitors coming and going we tend to ignore the stupid tourists, so that's where the idea of Parisian coldness comes from. We're tired of people asking for directions, blocking access to the metro while they peruse their maps and generally getting in the way while we're trying to get to/from work.

Meanwhile, we are post-scarcity in that we can provide a comfortable life to all. We don't have infinite resources, but we have enough to make it functional. Capitalism is somewhat responsible for limiting production now (especially in the Third World) as you cannot sell goods to those that lack the purchasing power to buy them.

So the solution is to nationalise all of the industry and resources and reform the government and society, so that the government is much more participatory and all people are trained, housed and employed.

In a nationalised system how would I build a prototype? How would I make enough samples for people to test it and vote on it? Would I have to go before a panel of Government industry experts and persuade them that my phone is a cool idea, without actually having a prototype? What makes them good at deciding?

Effectively capitalism allows us to vote on what we like (unfortunately our wallets are weighted by the market-derived value of our labour), and people make bets about what they think we're going to like.

I personally think the free market extremely efficiently *enables* the kind of democratically-induced production of consumer goods you're talking about. The limitation is the value of our labour... why should a banker earn 200x more per hour than someone cleaning a building, and as such have 200x more say in the weighting of production?

I think we have fairly similar feelings to be honest... I just think the free market is the best way of creating an efficient democratisation of production. The inherent problem with our system is we apply the same system to the value of labour. No one seems to examine *why* your standard of living should be tied to your value to the market other than as a motivator to increase your own personal value.

Edit: Just want to add, I think you're going to disagree because you seem to be tied to Marxism. In my opinion Marx fatally misunderstood the power of the free market for creating innovation in industry and creating the kind of consumer goods I'm talking about. This isn't necessarily down to a lack of intelligence, but its a property of when he lived. He was born in 1818. The Second Industrial revolution didn't even kick off until about 1850; his views were solidified before he even begun to see the effects of the real power of industry coupled with the power of the free market. I can almost guarantee that if Karl Marx had lived now he'd have a great deal more respect for the power of the free market to find and exploit the most efficient means to create what consumers (who we all are in a sufficiently free society) really want. I'm also sure he'd be disgusted with the way that standards of living are still tied to their labour value, but that's either a matter of redistributive taxation or regulating labour laws in my opinion.

&gt;
&gt;hiermit m√∂chten wir zu dem gestrigen Vorfall offiziell Stellung nehmen. Die Simovative GmbH ist eine Softwarefirma und entwickelt f√ºr Hochschulen sogenannte Campus Management Systeme. Die Simovative GmbH betreibt keine eigenen Portale oder Dienstleistungen im Internet, s√§mtliche Daten sind einzig und alleine Eigentum der jeweiligen Hochschulen und unterliegen einer strengen Datenschutzvereinbarung. Sollten Sie auch Empf√§nger einer dieser diffamierenden E-Mails gewesen sein und nicht an einer Universit√§t aus unserem Kundenkreis studieren, dann aus dem Grund, dass Sie fr√ºher ihr Interesse f√ºr ein Studium an einer dieser Universit√§ten bekundet haben.
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;Am Sonntag Abend wurden unsere Server gezielt und massiv angegriffen. Der Angriff richtete sich dabei gezielt gegen unsere Firma und nicht gegen unsere Kunden oder deren Daten. Dementsprechend sind keinerlei Daten abhanden gekommen oder manipuliert worden. Dem Angreifer ist es jedoch gelungen eine Sicherheitsl√ºcke des Mailserversystems auszun√ºtzen. Er konnte dadurch an alle sich in der Datenbank der jeweiligen Hochschule befindenden Studenten √ºber das System die E-Mail mit der √ºblen Nachrede versenden. Der Angreifer konnte aber nicht in den Besitz von sensiblen, personenbezogenen Daten gelangen. Auch eine Manipulation der Daten durch den Angreifer ist auszuschlie√üen. Derzeit wird das komplette System von Sicherheitsexperten mit Hochdruck einem intensiven Sicherheitscheck unterzogen, so dass solche Angriffe zuk√ºnftig vermieden werden k√∂nnen. Dadurch k√∂nnen vereinzelte Systeme vorr√ºbergehend nicht erreichbar sein.
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;Selbstverst√§ndlich wurde bereits gestern das Landeskriminalamt (LKA) eingeschaltet und Strafanzeige gegen Unbekannt gestellt. Derzeit werden von Spezialisten die Serverprotokolle ausgewertet, die Fahndung nach dem T√§ter l√§uft auf Hochtouren. Sie k√∂nnen sicher sein, dass wir diesem Fall h√∂chste Priorit√§t widmen und alles in unserer Macht befindliche unternehmen werden.
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;Wir bedauern diesen Vorfall zutiefst, m√∂chten uns in aller Form f√ºr die entstandenen Unannehmlichkeiten bei Ihnen entschuldigen und bedanken uns f√ºr Ihr Verst√§ndnis.

It's simple: they're angrier because, as a %, it's a greater increase than we've seen in Europe and they're heavily dependent. And why - the underlying oil price is heading up due to greater global demand (eg more cars in China), and they're feeling it more as their taxes are lower.

I've lived all over the place in the UK, Sheffield, Newcastle, Bristol, London, so I've taken in a fair bit of public transport in my time. 

But out of interest, have you ever been to LA? I spent over 6 months there, and to be honest, the public transport in Somerset was better.

To get from LAX to Santa Monica is basically un-doable by public transport, you have to drive or get a taxi.  (Of course there are places like New York and San Francisco which have excellent public transport)

Outside of the cities its an even greater contrast, So yes, public transport in rural UK is bad, but at least most people are 20 minutes drive from a train station, the USA doesn't really have a proper national rail network, and towns are far more spread out, so where as you could easily walk down to the shop in the morning, in rural and suburban USA, its all massive roads and strip malls, you're going to have to drive. Its hard to over-exaggerate how absent all forms of public transport are from a lot of the USA, the majority of the country is designed around cars.

true,[deleted],null,null,"J'aime beaucoup l'article en anglais qui est r√©f√©renc√© (http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/03/the-moral-crusade-against-foodies/8370/1/ )

C'est vrai que les US, c'est particulier de ce point de vue. Il y'a bien entendu le st√©r√©otype (pas infond√©) que les Am√©ricains mangent comme des porcs, et du coup en tant qu'expat' Fran√ßais on se dit que ceux qui appr√©cient la bonne bouffe auront quelque chose en commun avec nous- au final, pas vraiment.

L'Am√©ricain a besoin d'ext√©rioriser tout ce qu'il fait, d'en faire des embl√®mes sociaux. En France (et Europe en g√©n√©ral), c'est commun de connaitre quelqu'un (au boulot, etc.) pendant des ann√©es et d√©couvrir un beau jour qu'il est passionn√© de X ou Y, ou qu'il passe ses dimanches √† faire de l'aquarelle. 

Aux US, impossible- les gens portent leurs int√©r√™ts comme des badges. Si un Am√©ricain aime la bouffe, il se d√©clarera ""foodie""; si il aime courir le dimanche matin, il se d√©clarera comme ""athlete""; si il passe 2h par mois √† aider une charit√©, il le criera sur les toits; etc. C'est le pays du statut social apr√®s tout- toute action doit √™tre visible des autres.

Pour en revenir √† la bouffe, en France, on aime la bonne bouffe, mais on en fait pas tout en plat (h√©h√©). Un bon repas ou un bon resto sert plut√¥t de fond √† une discussion entre potes, une sortie en famille, un picnic en amoureux √† la campagne, etc. On appr√©cie la bouffe, mais on ne passe pas 3 plombes √† s'√©merveiller sur la texture du gratin dauphinois ou l'odeur du fromage. Bref, la bonne bouffe c'est dans notre sang, on sait la reconnaitre, mais on a pas besoin de l'ext√©rioriser √† ce point.

Aux US au contraire, il faut ext√©rioriser √ßa- comme le dit l'article, si on va au resto ou au march√© bio, il faut le dire; et pour confirmer le fait que √ßa soit motiv√© par les interactions sociales, comme l'article le montre, les gens sont pr√™ts √† mettre le prix. √ätre un ""foodie"", c'est une √©tiquette plus qu'une passion.

Un exemple qui m'est arriv√© r√©cemment qui est je trouve symptomatique est le fait que je fasse mon propre pain (ben oui, je vais pas me satisfaire du pain de mie US tout pourri). Quand un am√©ricain apprend √ßa, je suis tout de suite √©lev√© au rang de dieu vivant- pour lui, je suis un artisan boulanger, fleuron gastronome, qui doit sans doute passer ses week ends √† √©tudier les meilleurs farines et blablabla. Ben non, une fois par semaine je m√©lange de la farine, du sel, de la levure et de l'eau, je mets tout √ßa au four, et j'ai de quoi faire mes sandwich pour la semaine.

Bref aux US, on passe plus de temps √† philosopher sur ce qu'on fait plut√¥t que de le faire. J'ai une ex am√©ricaine qui se d√©clarait fana de cuisine, abonn√©e au food magazine, qui regardait the food network, qui disait qu'elle aimerait avoir son propre restaurant, etc. - si elle cuisine une fois par semaine, c'est bien le bout du monde. Ce genre de comportement est assez commun, et est soulign√© par le dernier paragraphe de l'article de OP sur les couvertures de magazine.

tl;dr: les Fran√ßais sont les maitres de la bouffe, et le reste du monde peut bien faire ce qu'il veut- √ßa ne changera pas. :D",0,1305147719,null,0,true,0,c1tkoh1,t3_h8xqf,t1_c1tkoh1,t3_h8xqf,1427138931,4,false,france,t5_2qhjz,4

Currently Schengen countries do random custom checks at border crossings - the only difference now is that Denmark will have a customs officer permanently stationed at the border doing _nothing_ (except when he's performing random checks every once in a while).

This is symbolic catering to the Danish People's party. In turn, a few days from now they're gonna vote Yes to significant reform of the pension system that goes totally against their party principles and wishes of their voters. In order to do that they have to have something to show for it - voila, fake tightening of the border controls coming our way.
