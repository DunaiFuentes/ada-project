true,CountVonTroll,null,null,"Racism is a class problem. The more educated, the less racist. You'll be dealing mostly with well educated people. Yes, I know that's another stereotype, but when you look at the polls that list *Abitur* (highschool degree that lets you attend a university), you'll find that this factor alone cuts anti-Muslim sentiment in half.

Staying with statistics, Muslims in North America indeed tend to be much better integrated into society, but they're also above average in things like household income or education. It's the reverse in Europe. ""Muslim"" is mostly a euphemism for a section of the working class. People aren't thinking of the Turkish-German engineer when they use the word Muslim, but of his cousin who dropped out of school and doesn't have a job. People will see you more as a Canadian.

So, yeah. There is some prejudice, but they're not talking about you. Not that this makes it any better.

Edit: To understand some of the background, consider [this chart](http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Berufsabschl%C3%BCsse_Berlin_Spiegel_42-2009.png&amp;filetimestamp=20100630183009).

true,devgeek0,ZBTQuebec,Québec,"Oui effectivement l'acquisition du language est différente chez les bilingues, mais d'abord il faut noter qu'il y a très peu de bilingues à 100 % dans le monde. La plupart des gens ne sont pas en mesure de profiter d'un environnement où les langues sont équilibrées à l'oral (c'est-à-dire les deux langues s'employent également dans les mêmes contextes). Le plus souvent, il arrive que l'une des langues devient dominante (ça peut changer plusieurs fois dans la vie).

Mais comme tu as certainement constaté, la situation n'est pas si simple que cela. Généralement, la dominance d'une langue varie beaucoup selon le contexte. Il arrive souvent aux enfants nés d'une famille bilingue (dont la langue maternelle des parents n'est pas la langue principale de la société, e.g., des immigrants) qu'ils ne sont pas capable de parler la langue familiale hors contexte -- à l'université ou en voyage -- alors qu'ils parlent de façon ""native-like"" à la maison avec les parents. La compétence linguistique est toujours présente évidemment, mais le déplacement de contexte rend l'usage de la langue tellement difficile.

Si tu as fait une partie de tes études en anglais, c'est sur que tu vois cet effet déjà -- moi, j'ai fait mon premier cours de phonétique à l'université en français, et le reste de mes cours linguistique en anglais. Même aujourd'hui, j'ai plus tendance à diretous les termes phonétiques en français que les équivalents anglais, alors que j'ai vraiment du mal à exprimer des concepts linguistiques en français. Mais le «contexte» en question n'est pas forcément le domaine du sujet, ça peut être l'interlocuteur (la personne avec qui tu parles), le registre (langage familier, soigné, soutenu) etc ainsi que le domaine.

Bref, tout cela pour dire : Si tu te lances dans de nouveaux contextes où il faut parler français, tu ne vas plus associer ta vie à l'étranger à seulement la langue anglaise, et probablement, les mots «plus français» te viendront bien plus facilement, et quand tu rentres finalement, le français ne t'échappera plus.

I try to respect copyright, but copyright law in the U.S. is far out of all proportion to all history of ownership of intellectual property in open society. 

Patent and copyright are supposed to grant a temporary monopoly to encourage innovation, but then release the rights to all for the advancement of society, not grant them in perpetuity.  We're supposed to be beyond the regal monopolies of arbitrary power. It's not genocide, but it is dictatorial, especially enforcement by blackout fiat. 

In the U.S., Tea Party and Libertarians like to imagine that only government can abridged personal liberty, but corporations track everyone's purchases, and they decide if one is deserving of the means to own a home, car, or whatever.

The point I was making by posting the survey from the National Centre for Social Research, is that this statement is not accurate.

Unfortunately it appears that despite evidence provided, you still refuse to accept reality.

 &gt;But in marxist speak ""working class"" has a specific meaning. That working class was made of poor factory workers, had the famous ""class consciousness""', and voted for socialist/communist parties, seeking to overcome the burgeoisie

Marx defined class by relationships to the means of production not on the basis of being a 'poor factory worker' or having a 'class consciousness' or if you 'voted for socialist/communist parties' or sought to 'overcome the bourgeoisie' 

&gt;From the lexicon, I suspect that the author of the article still lives in that ideologic dream

I think that you can safely presume that the author of the posted article does feel that a working class exists. To classify that as an 'idealogic dream' appears to be undermined by the survey from the National Centre for Social Research, which I posted yesterday. 

&gt;This means a struggle for the socialisation of the banks and all major international financial institutions under the supervision and democratic control of the working class

I appreciate you don't agree with Marxism and socialism but to make illogical claims about the non-existence of a working class, by displaying a poor understanding of the Marxist definition of the working class, while denying the evidence supplied and failing to supply any to support your claim, just undermines your argument.

I pay about 850€ per month, internet, television, electricity, water, etc all included to live directly in the center of a major(ish) city.  I have a bedroom, office, living room, large kitchen, and a laundry room.  My (brand new) washing machine only cost 250€ at Saturn.  I do live in an old, prewar, building, but I prefer it because it has high ceilings.  

I agree entirely with you about the garbage separation, but I think you will find that most Germans share this complaint with us.  

You sound like you are going through what is known as *culture shock*.  This term is often misused to mean the shock you receive from noticing a culture which is different than your own, but what it really means is the feeling you get after living there for several months and you just get **so tired** from everything being subtly different.

You don't realize the comfort to be had in using the same lightswitches and outlets that you have your whole life.  The little things like that don't seem like a big deal in the beginning, but after living for months in a place with weird lightswitches, you start to notice how tired it makes you.

I am not experiencing any culture shock here yet, but this is my second move.  I went through it hardcore when I lived in the UK.  It took me about 9 months to get over it.  

That being said, I have never heard of such a thing as these quiet hours.  Are you sure that they exist?  I was vacuuming last night at 3:30 AM and have been doing laundry all day today.  Also, opening the windows for an hour or so once a week should be fine.  Remember to open it all the way, and not just at the top.  The top is great for temperature regulation, but they have actually proven to not exchange air properly.  

What city are you in?  Maybe we can hang out.  Also, with the exception of last summer, I don't think it normally hits 40 degrees in the summer around these parts.  AC isn't really necessary here, but you can buy one on amazon.

My best advice is to read your post again and consider two things: 1. how much of this is actually just whining and not important? and 2. how much of this is you trying to maintain your North American lifestyle in a foreign country?  I don't blame you for 1 - just realize that this is the culture shock talking.  Work hard at number 2 and number 1 will naturally fade away.

So most of the things you complain about are pretty normal, but I'm German and used to it - I'll try to work to your points and maybe I can offer some advise:

&gt;salary deductions are absolutely ridiculous

welcome to the well-fare state - now you're the one paying but there may be a time when you're depending on someone else helping you


&gt; i.e. Germans have a lower standard of living (by American standards) and therefore pay less

Actually I think it's the other way around but that's just my personal opinion - maybe you can give an example why you think the standards here are lower

&gt;apartments/flats are expensive and poor quality, nearly impossible to find them furnished

This absolutely depends on the place you're staying and your wishes. Poor quality is depending on your view I guess because compared to even newly build US homes even 60 year old German houses are way better. Not only in terms of heat sealing and toughness.
Germans tend to buy theire own furniture because we mostly don't like the idea of someone else having used it before.


&gt;The prices were extremely high. For a first floor one bedroom + office + den, about a 10 minute walk from the city center, I ended up paying more than I would have for a centrally located penthouse in most North American cities

Especially the last part I simply can't believe!

&gt;On top of that, the agent listing the apartment charged me an additional 2.2 months rent, plus one month deposit to the landlord. Just finding a place to live and the first month put me back nearly $7000

Agents usually take 1-2.5 months rent for theire service but you can find many flats not listed by agents and therefore without paying them. The deposit to the landlord differs from one month to three months in most cities, depending if you rent private or from a housing association.

&gt;Now, this apartment doesn't have any furniture. So I had to shell out another $2000 on a bed, desk, table, and a few chairs. None of it is comfortable or nice; that would have run me upwards of $8000.

You seem to have a pretty expensive life style - don't get me wrong but my entire apartment is furnished I haven't paid more than you!

&gt;appliances like washers and dryers are rarely included

true but you can get combined machines at about 400€ new, if you really need a dryer. Most people I know just hang theire laundry and let it dry by itself

&gt;I was lucky and found a washer/dryer set for 500 EUR. They're both run down and barely work. Lovely.

Sorry to be the one telling you this but I think you got fooled on this one


&gt;The cheapest I can get is 200 EUR / month, for three hours of cleaning once every week

This means 12 working hours - broken down to a hourly rate this would be about 16€/hour - not cheap, agreed, but as you mentioned salary deductions are high. I know this is, again, completely depending on where you're living, but there should be cheaper possibilities.


&gt;Recycling is way too complicated, but it seems that everyone here is anal about it. There are like six bins to separate things; they recycle everything, and even with a poster telling me what goes in each bin, I'm still not completely sure where some things go, which makes even throwing something away a task

You'll get used to that pretty quick!

&gt;On top of that, there's nobody to pick up your plastic bottles. Instead, you need to return them to the store you bought them from (yes, that store specifically, not any other store) and you get some small refund. This is hell. Depending on where I'm at, I do my shopping at different stores, and end up having no idea which bottle has to be returned to which store. I have to make a circuit around town, which takes about an hour, just to get rid of them.

That' simply not true or you've been told something completely wrong - you can return them everywhere where plastic bottles are sold even at gas stations etc. Like it or not but this makes our streets way cleaner.

&gt;Garbage is rarely picked up. I don't even know how often it's picked up, or when, but it's definitely not every week.

Again depending from your city but usually picked up once a week on certain dates, at least every two weeks - maybe the winter caused them some problems the last weeks.

&gt;Quiet hours. I often arrive home around (or later than) 7:00 PM. This means I only have one hour to do anything that makes a lot of noise, such as laundry (takes longer than an hour) or turning on my dishwasher. I can't wash dishes or do laundry, period, on Sundays. This only leaves Saturdays. If something happens and my coat gets dirty or I run out of clean clothes during the week, I have to clean them by hand and hang them up to dry or wear them dirty.

If your neighbours or your landlord don't complain about it, this shouldn't really be a problem - I'm in the same situation and often wash at night but noone ever complained about it! Give it a try, most people will understand - you probably shouldn't do your laundry at 3am but until 10pm you should be fine!

&gt;When I leave my apartment, I have to open windows because none of the buildings here have any sort of system that exchanges air. Supposedly, I'll end up with mould if I don't do this. I'm perpetually in a rush to get to work on time, no matter how early I wake up, and this just makes everything worse.

It can't be that hard to open a window before you leave, really!

&gt;Air conditioning may as well not exist. I'm not looking forward to the summer. At all. Opening windows is not an acceptable replacement for air conditioning when it's 40 degrees outside. Normally, I wouldn't even consider an apartment without air conditioning, but there was no choice here. The heating is also bad. Most of it seems to be done by these grate things on the walls. They have dials that go from 0 to 5. It's extremely hard (impossible?) to get the temperature you want, it's always either way too hot or not hot enough.

Because of the climate there's no real need for air conditioning and you'll get used to the heating, believe me! And that's another point where the buildings come into play - good isolation and you'll even have a well conditioned home in mid-summer.

&gt;Most people here have no sense of personal space. This really bothers me. If I'm standing in line at a cashier and there's a person behind me, they will get as close as they possibly can without touching me. It doesn't matter if they're young or old, they'll literally stand just inches behind me. I find this extremely uncomfortable, like they're trying to pick my pocket or something.

This is something I can completely relate to, but sadly can't offer any advise. I usually try to step on theire feet or ask them if they think it will speed things up if they come closer - you'll get some strange looks but I think there's not much you can do about it.

I hope you can enjoy your stay in Germany once you managed to get used to certain things and I'm pretty sure the spring and summer will shed another light on many things!

Nah, not using dryers or air conditioners ain't culture shock, it's just a reduced quality of life.  Most flats don't even have thermostats, just valves on the radiators that you have to adjust constantly based on outside temperature or radiator input temperature.

true,DocTomoe,BAWU,Baden-Württemberg,"As a German, I don't even know where to begin.

&gt; A short list of problems: salary deductions are absolutely ridiculous,

On the other hand, you get a worthwhile social net should you ever need it, and an acceptable health insurance.

&gt; apartments/flats are expensive and poor quality, 

Depends strongly where you live, but I have an appartment for 210 Euros heated, in a 5-year-old building.

&gt; nearly impossible to find them furnished, appliances like washers and dryers are rarely included, 

We like to own our own stuff. If we wanted a room to live in with furniture and appliances in it, we'd go to a hotel or a ""Pension"".

&gt; i.e. Germans have a lower standard of living (by American standards) and therefore pay less.

Excuse me?

&gt; I'm not in one of the major cities, but the city I'm in does have a population of about 100,000. Finding an apartment/flat in the city center was very hard. 

We do have a somewhat-working ÖPNV (subways, street trains, busses). Why did you need to live in the city center?

&gt; The majority (possibly all, my memory is fuzzy) of them were old

Also called ""Altbauwohnung"", and highly searched for by young, rich professionals.

&gt; and what I would consider run down. 

Do you, by any chance, live in EAST Germany?

&gt; The prices were extremely high. For a first floor one bedroom + office + den, about a 10 minute walk from the city center, I ended up paying more than I would have for a centrally located penthouse in most North American cities. 

You should consider yourself being a target of a well-orchestrated scam against a gullible foreigner :)

&gt; On top of that, the agent listing the apartment charged me an additional 2.2 months rent, plus one month deposit to the landlord. Just finding a place to live and the first month put me back nearly $7000.

But you wanted the services of the Makler, and thus you have to pay for it. The deposit will be returned to you.

&gt; Now, this apartment doesn't have any furniture. So I had to shell out another $2000 on a bed, desk, table, and a few chairs. None of it is comfortable or nice; that would have run me upwards of $8000. 

If you didn't shop in one of those designer outlets, I find this figure hard to believe. I outfitted my whole flat (two rooms, desk, office chair, table and some chairs, sleeping room) for about 1200, and I live very comfortably.

&gt; I have to go through the process of selling it all when I move back to North America, and I'm really not looking forward to this.

If you know you are going back in a short timeframe (e.g. 2-5 years), why would you spend so fucking much money on furniture?

&gt; Now I need to buy a washer and dryer, because of course, that's not included. I was lucky and found a washer/dryer set for 500 EUR. They're both run down and barely work. Lovely.

Both easily available new for 100-200 Euros each at any major electrics store such as Media Markt or Saturn.
See http://www.mediamarkt.de/angebot/waschmaschine_trockner/

&gt; Now, since I only have a limited amount of time at home each day, I don't have time for cleaning (nor do I want to clean). So I look for a cleaning service. The cheapest I can get is 200 EUR / month, for three hours of cleaning once every week. Great. I will concede that cleaning people here are very thorough, though.

That's about 15 bucks an hour, extremly expensive for Germany. Did you order this service from a professional cleaning service?

&gt; Recycling is way too complicated, but it seems that everyone here is anal about it. There are like six bins to separate things; they recycle everything, and even with a poster telling me what goes in each bin, I'm still not completely sure where some things go, which makes even throwing something away a task.

If it's organic -&gt; Biotonne. If it's paper -&gt; Papiertonne. If it has a Grüner Punkt-&gt; Gelber Sack/ Gelbe Tonne. Batteries, meds and other dangerous chemicals are Sondermüll. Anything else goes into the regular trash. What's so complicated about it?

&gt; On top of that, there's nobody to pick up your plastic bottles. 

To the contrary: Gift them to a bum - he will gladly take them, for 16 bottles means a warm meal.

&gt; Instead, you need to return them to the store you bought them from (yes, that store specifically, not any other store) 

This has been correct until 2004 (or: seven fucking years ago). Plastic bottles are refundable at *any* store that sells plastic bottles. 

&gt; This is hell. 

&gt; Garbage is rarely picked up. I don't even know how often it's picked up, or when, but it's definitely not every week. It might even be once a month. 

Regular trash is usually collected every week. Gelber Sack is collected between each two to four weeks.

&gt; Quiet hours. I often arrive home around (or later than) 7:00 PM. This means I only have one hour to do anything that makes a lot of noise, such as laundry (takes longer than an hour) or turning on my dishwasher. 

Quiet hours usually begin at 2200 hours. It is extremly rare the tenants of a building collectively decide the quiet hours begin at 2000 - your landlord cannot - without the majority of the tenants - decide to enforce that rule before 2200.

&gt; I can't wash dishes or do laundry, period, on Sundays. 

You can let your laundry / dishes being washed while you're at work. As you stated above that you bought ridiculously expensive household appliances, those should have automatic time programs. Consult the respective manuals.

&gt; When I leave my apartment, I have to open windows because none of the buildings here have any sort of system that exchanges air. 

Actually, you're doing it wrong. You should do ""Stoßlüften"", which means opening all windows five minutes three times a day (before you leave for work, as soon as you come home, and before you go to bed).

&gt; Air conditioning may as well not exist. I'm not looking forward to the summer. At all. Opening windows is not an acceptable replacement for air conditioning when it's 40 degrees outside.

Just keep the blinds down, put some beer into the fridge, and buy a 10-Euro-Ventilator.

&gt; Normally, I wouldn't even consider an apartment without air conditioning, but there was no choice here. The heating is also bad. Most of it seems to be done by these grate things on the walls. They have dials that go from 0 to 5. It's extremely hard (impossible?) to get the temperature you want, it's always either way too hot or not hot enough.

You can buy and install automatic thermostats which allow you to set a specific temperature. They run for about 15-20 bucks a Heizkörper. Hint: Let professionals install them. See http://bit.ly/i52RUZ

OR: wear a sweater if you're cold.

&gt; Most people here have no sense of personal space. This really bothers me. If I'm standing in line at a cashier and there's a person behind me, they will get as close as they possibly can without touching me. It doesn't matter if they're young or old, they'll literally stand just inches behind me. I find this extremely uncomfortable, like they're trying to pick my pocket or something.

It's called ""standing in line"", and a favorite pasttime of my people. Standing near each other conserves space and prevents others from sneaking in.

&gt; I'm probably going to be stuck here for about a year, because I don't want to leave until I've reacquired the money I blew while moving.

&gt; We like to own our own stuff. If we wanted a room to live in with furniture and appliances in it, we'd go to a hotel or a ""Pension"".

It's not realistic for anyone but a millionaire to stay at a hotel for a year straight. What are those of us who are here for longer than a few weeks supposed to do? It's ridiculous to have to buy a full set of furniture that you aren't even going to be able to keep.

&gt; We do have a somewhat-working ÖPNV (subways, street trains, busses). Why did you need to live in the city center?

&gt; But you wanted the services of the Makler, and thus you have to pay for it. The deposit will be returned to you.

I didn't 'want' to, I had no choice. There were literally zero 'public' (what's the term for this?) listings for apartments or flats in the city center.

&gt; If you know you are going back in a short timeframe (e.g. 2-5 years), why would you spend so fucking much money on furniture?

Do you expect me to sleep and eat dinner on the floor? There was no choice to just rent furniture, so I had to buy it. You're making comments about me saying the quality of living here is lower than America, and then implying 'Why buy comfortable furniture? Just use crappy, uncomfortable furniture that's cheaper!'

I didn't buy appliances other than a washer/dryer.

This is another example of lowering standards. Thermostats are a given in North America. They're in every house and apartment, period. It's silly that I can't just come home from work and find everything at a comfortable temperature, instead of having to fiddle with knobs over the next hour.

3) Ability to drink anywhere, and very very cheap beer compared to Canada. I can buy 3 liters of good beer here for $5.50. That is absolutely impossible in Canada. I can also drink outside, before I go into a pub or in a park in summer. Great times!

I know it is different in America because you guys have a lot of space and square meters/feet aren't that expensive, but you really shouldn't spend 80% of your income on month to month expenses. Maybe your spending needs some adjustments to Europe ;)

[Plusieurs bactéries sont responsables de l’intoxication alimentaire. Elles peuvent être présentes dans les aliments pour différentes raisons: 
Les gens qui sont malades peuvent contaminer la nourriture qu’ils préparent. 
La bactérie peut être dans l’eau que vous buvez, surtout quand vous allez à l’étranger. 
La bactérie peut contaminer les œufs et la viande, ce qui entraîne la salmonellose. 
Si vous laissez trop longtemps à la température de la pièce de la viande, du poisson ou des produits laitiers cuits ou crus et des aliments préparés, la bactérie peut se développer et vous pouvez être malade (salmonellose). 
Les aliments en conserve peuvent contenir des bactéries néfastes si les boîtes sont déformées ou très vieilles (botulisme). 
Les bébés de moins d’un an ne devraient pas manger de miel parce qu’il contient une bactérie naturelle qu’ils ont de la difficulté à digérer. 
Les fruits de mer crus, surtout les crustacés, peuvent entraîner une intoxication alimentaire virale. 
Certains champignons, certaines baies, les germes de pomme de terre et autres plantes sont vénéneux pour les humains. 
La moisissure que l’on trouve parfois sur les fruits et les légumes, les céréales et les noix qui n’ont pas été convenablement entreposés peut également être nocive. 
Les pesticides et les contenants de produits chimiques qui n’ont pas été convenablement nettoyés peuvent aussi causer une intoxication alimentaire.](http://www.ahsc.health.nb.ca/Patients/HealthInformation/EmergencyHealthServices/food_poisoningfr.shtml)

Maintenant, le fait d'obliger les gens à payer (même peu) pour avoir de la musique en illimité, alors que jusqu'à présent on pouvait écouter ce qu'on voulait, autant qu'on le voulait sur deezer, constitue une régression par rapport à l'offre actuelle ; il ne faut pas s'attendre à ce que les gens soient contents.

It's a canard to pretend that the average person can opt out of the entire system of credit and money transfer, and in this case, access to information. Corporate tyranny is protected by government.

Thank you. Governments - at least you can vote them out of power. I can't do anything about a multi-billion investment bank that is exploiting the real estate business until the world economy collapses.. oh wait I can vote for a government that can regulate that.. oh now I'm a communist. Darn it!

true,klabauterfrau,null,null,"To be honest, your post is pretty insulting, being a German.  But I will try to be as open-minded as possible. 

Maybe you can get over the negative feeling towards Germany, when you try to appreciate the ideas behind some of the things. 

For example: The tax break. The German system is based on the idea, that we live in one community. The better earners pay more taxes, because they can afford to pay more. That way, everybody has the same chance to (for example) go to university (free quality schools here and nearly no university fees), have health insurance, get unemployment help, etc.  The idea is, that we all take care of each other and support the poorest and weakest. I am not trying to say, that this works out perfectly, but the difference between rich and poor is not so big here. We consider that a good thing. In most of the cities, you will not find ghettos, houses may not be great everywhere, but at least everybody can afford a decent apartment. You may feel that living standards are higher in the US, but have you taken the whole US population into account? I don't know, but I guess you have only considered the small US middle class and not the many people who have to work two jobs and still cannot pay health insurance? I can see how this system is annoying to you, since you and your kids are not going take advantage of the system. On the other hand, as other people have already said, it is advisable to learn about things like that when you move to another country and base your decision to move there on more than just a career option.

Another example: Recycling. I can see that coming from some of the US States, recycling is annoying. (But having been to Seattle, I assure you, that it is not much different there.) The idea behind is that we try to waste as less as possible. We had a huge green movement in the 80s here and the green party is still very influential. I must totally agree that the system is complicated and it takes effort to recycle (anywhere in the world). But have you ever thought about where the billions of plastic bottles are dumped, once they have been used in the US? 

Furniture: Yes, that also is annoying, if you only come here for a year. And the German way makes moving one of the worst things I can think of. (By the way, check your rent contract, if you have to paint the walls when you move out !) But the idea behind that is that we like our individual styles. Our apartments are part of our personalities, we express ourselves by the way we live. If you enter a German house or apartment, you will very likely get a tour of the house first.  Also, we in general do not want sleep on the couch some grandma has farted into :-). 

There are other things that are annoying about the German culture for sure. I for example think, that Germans are not as friendly as Americans and that they can be pretty anal about sticking to the rules, even if the rules make no sense. (Ever been yelled at for walking when traffic light is red?) 

I can also think about a lot of annoying aspects about the US culture, but I can also see many of the good things, too. 

And that is the point. If you choose to live in another country and want to be happy there, you have to accept it and try to like even the strange things. If you move only for career reasons without the willingness to experience a different mind set and a different view of the world, the emotions you are having right now are bound to occur.

So, suck it up, try to see the good sides and let the Germans explain the country to you. Once you have understood us, you MUST like us :-)",0,1295892066,null,0,true,0,c1e0btu,t3_f7jmp,t1_c1e0btu,t3_f7jmp,1426715918,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

Things to do: For drinks and bars find the Kreuzviertel. Lots of good bars and pubs. There is also a good little club there: Silent Sinners. Also for clubbing and concerts: FZW near the Hauptbahnhof. They have good concerts and clubnights. (The audience for some of the clubnights is a littel older, though.)  You might also like the Limericks (an Irish pub) near the Hauptbahnhof.  If you like it rough an dirty, go to the Spirit. It is a club owned by the local biker gang. Better after 2 or 3 am, best very drunk !
 
Dortmund brews its own mircobrew: Hövels. Go out for a traditional German food and beer night in the Hövelsbrauerei. Maybe after you saw a play in the theatre. The ""Studiobühne"" in the ""Schauspielhaus"" has pretty good experimental stuff going on and tickets are half off for students (bring your student ID). 

Do you like climbing? Dortmund has the best climbing hall of the whole Ruhrpott (that is what we call the Ruhrgebiet). It is on the outskrits, but well worth it (www.kletterhalle-bergewerk.de).

IN the summer: Rombergpark and Westfalenpark for some great walks.  For some beer drinking (and other things) at night: West Park 

The Nordstadt may look a little rough at the beginning, but you will find some very good ethnic food there and some cool bars, too. In the summer, there is even a beach bar in the (industrial) harbor. 

For getting away I would recommend the nearby lakes (Möhne, Sorpe, etc.) All the other surrounding towns have cool stuff. Bochum for example also has a very cool bar scene. You can travel for free with your Stundtenticket in all of NRW. Make use of it. But do not even try to understand the train system, just ask other people to help you. 

For being up to date, get a Coolibri magazine at the beginning of the month. You will find it in most bars to take for free. It will give you info on the best things to do in town.

Have fun in Dortmund. It is a great place. At the beginning you might think that it is ugly, since a lot of its pretty parts were destroyed in WWII and rebuilt in the 50s and 60s. But be assured, it has a lot of pretty places, is very diverse, has a lot of ""underground"" culture. The people are a little rough in the beginning, but have a ""soft heart under a rough shell"". (That's a German saying: Harte Schale, weicher Kern.)

Just taking a cursory look, I'd mistaken Belarus for the Czechs, just because he looks like the Good Soldier Svejk. But now that you mention it this makes much more sense - the red star, the farm stuff, the tattered clothes. Georgia makes total sense too now that you say it.

I'm still a bit confused about the Balkans though. The guy in the Serbian nationalist sweater is obvious, and to his right I suppose is Greece and to his left Albania? The three guys below them must then look kind of interchangable though. I guess the one in the patched blue sweater is Bosnia, because of the patches and also the headwear. That leaves Croatia, Montenegro and Macedonia, and which one of those is then supposed to be represented by the poor babushka? And is there no Kosovo?

The Bosnian link with Turkey makes sense though.

However, there's still some confusion, because baxinho's and your choices for the remaining four were, each one of them, different. Ha, see, it ain't that easy! :-) 

See my reply to his -- I'm persuaded by his picks for Bosnia and Albania, which takes them out of the running for the poor woman and the blue-shirted guy. Are they Kosovo and Montenegro, like he says? I think one of them must be Macedonia, which is less likely to be missing than Kosovo, which has probably never taken part in Eurovision yet.

true,HardlyWorkingDotOrg,null,null,"Well, I think the bottom line is that in general, the living situation is not really geared towards extended but ultimately time-limited stays.  
When you look for an apartment, you look for one because you now live in the city and want to continue living there for the foreseeable future.  
  
If you are really well off, like I guess is the case with you, you could probably look into buying a house. We have mortgages and stuff, too. Of course, that also only works for people who are here indefinitely and can afford it.  
In that case, you would get a *lot* of living quality back that you miss, I think.  
No quite hours etc. And having a house gives one the advantage of living somewhere with a lot of room and (to an extend) just the way *you* envision living in a house should be like. That alone adds a lot to the quality of living, I think.  
  
But, for someone like you who is not here for just a week, but also not here for 10 or 20 years it can be tough. The only option you have is an apartment.  
But, I think you really just had either bad luck or didn't do enough legwork. Because from what I've seen, it *is* possible to find an apartment that comes completely furnished. Also is it possible to find nice, newer apartments were the heating/cooling is a non-issue because everything is brand spanking new. Maybe not directly in the city center, but a little bit outside of that. Which in turn does not pose a problem, necessarily. Buses, trains or a cheap car would do the trick.  
  
The reason that many people actually rather live outside of the city could be because, historically, the city center is *very* *very* old and certainly does not add any value other than proximity. It is not like in the US where the citys are most often quite new*ish* and therefore the buildings are newer and up to coat etc.  
  
In Germany, you have to travel a bit away from the city to see better architecture.  
  
In conclusion, it could be that you are really just out of luck in your particular area. Or you could have had a better starting point with a little more research and/or help from native co-workers. Again, I don't know the people you work with but I know that *I* would lend a hand in apartment hunting and stuff like that so you wouldn't end up in a dump that is overpriced on top of it all. Of course, those places exist. As I am sure I could end up in such a place in the US, too if I don't know exactly how things work over there.",0,1295968469,null,0,false,0,c1e4h7b,t3_f7jmp,t1_c1e4h7b,t1_c1dx19n,1426717874,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

If you really want to give Germany a fair chance you're going to have to give it more time. Give it five years then get back to us. 

Also, remember all the problems that you've mentioned are superficial and/or material.

My suggestion: try to live in Germany more unconditionally, instead of always filtering everything through your American perspective, spend time with Germans, learn the language and try to look at things beyond money, objects and irritating routines that essentially only are neglible matters. To really get to know Germany you can pursue German culture (art, theater, film, sports, literature, history, cuisine, etc.).

Whoa.)

The US has control over its own fiscal policy.  They could, for example, devalue the dollar.  It'd royally screw up pretty much everything, but they could.  They can also print a bunch of money (e.g. QE2) and slip it into the system in various ways, hoping that nobody really notices, use those to buy bonds, drive down bond yields thus allowing the government to borrow more cheaply, while raising bond prices, at the cost of inflation.

Greece, for example, has no such resource.

Fundamentally, yes, it's a question of governments spending and borrowing beyond their means, putting other interconnected economies at risk.  But the reason Greece comes up more often than any other of the PIIGS is that the very fundamentals of it joining the Eurozone in the first place were fraudulent (e.g. the calculation of indebtedness and future government revenue projections were based on absolutely hilarious figures.)",0,1296062070,null,0,false,0,c1eaa6u,t3_f96vc,t1_c1eaa6u,t1_c1ea8gt,1426720599,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

It's not about the addressed people being superiors.

I even address homeless people on the street or younger students with ""Sie"", just because it's professional and polite. It means that I'm taking them seriously.

&gt;I got the impression that this asshole took a disliking to me since day 1.

You called him ""Du"" before establishing it. The only situation where that is normal is when an adult talks to a child. So he got the impression you are not taking him seriously/like a child. 

Maybe he just has an inferiority/superiority complex of some sort and interpretes such things as severe affronts. (In any case: From a German common courtesy perspective It was rude.)


I would suggest to you the book [""Knigge""](http://www.amazon.de/Knigge-heute-Benehmen-richtige-Umgangsformen/dp/3817464630/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1296078595&amp;sr=8-4) or [""Business Knigge"".](http://www.amazon.de/Business-Knigge-die-wichtigsten-Benimmregeln-Anke-Quittschau/dp/3448079847/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1296078595&amp;sr=8-5)

Most people in bigger companies pretty much expect that behaviour.

&gt;Or am I way off the mark here?

Yes.

It's just polite to address everyone with ""Sie"". He might not like you because you seemed rude or unprofessional by calling him ""Du"" without him or you offering it to each other first.

Seriously, this is basically the only thing about politeness you have to keep in mind when talking German. The difference between ""du"" and ""Sie"". 

You could just apologize because you had a German teacher who hasn't taught you the difference and nobody called your attention to it, yet. Tell him you think you two had a bad start and you talk to other people about it and didn't want to be rude or unprofessional.

If he is still an asshole, then he is just an asshole.

Just one more city and it would be worth buying a rebate card that lets you travel at half the price for a whole year…  
If you rent a car, a naive look at the Sixt page suggests you could get a VW Golf class car for two weeks for ~€460. According to Google Maps, the round trip by car is ~1650km (1000 miles.) One liter of gas costs about €1.50 (US$7.70/gallon), so depending on the car and how you decide to drive on a road without speed limits, that's easily upwards of €150 for fuel.  
In other words, both options would cost about the same overall, and yes, that's expensive -- welcome to Europe.

Using a car within those cities would be impractical. The city centers proper tend to be walkable, and there aren't even any cars allowed within the main shopping areas. To move between different parts of the city or to get to sights or to your hotel, the subway/tram is the most convenient in all three cities -- check for a nearby station before you book a hotel. With a car, you'd have to find (and near the center also pay) for a parking space, and go back to your car whenever you want to drive elsewhere. Subway stations are always near.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Germans have a lower standard of living

By what measure?

Germans generally try to have a higher living standard than Americans. That means people aren't able to earn as much as an individual because we pay a lot of money for the social security and wellbeing of others. Actually, a lot of people measure what to spend money on on what America is doing wrong.

Yes, you have less money personally, that's so those less fortunate than you can survive without problems, too.

But yes, if standard of living is not measured in stability and social security but in how many luxury items you can own, that's true. (In that regard Germany actually tries to *lower* their ""quality of living"" further in the future. ;))

For the flat/furniture/washing thing I can not give you any critique. I don't know where you live in Germany but that sounds just very unlucky to me.

I could offer you a 3 room flat, furniture/water/electricity included for 400€/month in my city.

&gt;The cheapest I can get is 200 EUR / month, for three hours of cleaning once every week. Great. I will concede that cleaning people here are very thorough, though.

You complain that salaries in Germany can sustain an individual's existence? How much do you earn per hour? 
Also: You can get cleaning service for less than 10€/hour. I'm 100% certain of that.

&gt;I ended up paying more than I would have for a centrally located penthouse in most North American cities.

That sounds like you got ripped off. :)
What do you pay/month?

&gt;So I had to shell out another $2000 on a bed, desk, table, and a few chairs. None of it is comfortable or nice

There's a store called IKEA... for 2000€ you could get everything AND it would be comfortable. 

&gt;I don't even know how often it's picked up, or when, but it's definitely not every week. 

Even in the most rural areas all garbage gets picked up AT LEAST once per weak. Your trash also doesn't get collected if you put metal/glass into the paper container or industrial waste into the biological waste container, etc.

Maybe you are doing it wrong? You have to put your trash can outside, up to front of the sidewalk. You can also request a garbage calendar from every city council, where the exact date of the collection of each type of garbage is listed.

&gt;On top of that, there's nobody to pick up your plastic bottles. Instead, you need to return them to the store you bought them from (yes, that store specifically, not any other store) and you get some small refund.

Yep.

That serves two reasons. First: Recycling. Secondly: Discouraging you from buying bottled stuff in the first place.

&gt;Depending on where I'm at, I do my shopping at different stores, and end up having no idea which bottle has to be returned to which store.

Actually, the ""pfand""-bottles can be returned to *any* store that sells ""pfand""-bottled stuff. You can't return the bottles to any store which doesn't sell such bottles. Some storeowners are annoyed to take bottles you haven't bought in their store, but if they sell the beverage your bottles stem from, they are LEGALLY REQUIRED TO TAKE BACK YOUR BOTTLES. 

If you buy weird stuff only one store in the whole city sells, then yes, you can't give it back anywhere else.

&gt;I often arrive home around (or later than) 7:00 PM. This means I only have one hour to do anything that makes a lot of noise, such as laundry (takes longer than an hour) or turning on my dishwasher.

That's wrong. Legal quiet hours are from 1pm to 2:30pm... and from **22pm to 6am**.

If you get back at 7pm, you have THREE hours to do what you want. If anyone complains, then you can just ignore them.

&gt;When I leave my apartment, I have to open windows because none of the buildings here have any sort of system that exchanges air.

Wow, hahahaha, where do you live? That's jsut ridiculous! :D

&gt;Air conditioning may as well not exist. 

Yes, you have to pay for it yourself, because it's a very wasteful and ecologically damaging activity. Buy an air conditioner and pay the electricity bill.

&gt;The heating is also bad.

Again: Maybe you should change apartements. In what kind of shithole do you live? :D

&gt;They have dials that go from 0 to 5. It's extremely hard (impossible?) to get the temperature you want, it's always either way too hot or not hot enough.

Uhmm... what do you want instead? Again: An air conditioner is an incredibly wasteful machine, no houseowner would consider putting something like that up.

&gt;I find this extremely uncomfortable, like they're trying to pick my pocket or something.

You are in Germany, nobody is trying to pick your pocket. ;)
Maybe they like you. Give them a hug. I don't really notice this problem, I think that's just your personal problem and nothing to be disappointed of.

&gt;my colleagues didn't mention most of this

Really, I can't believe anyone has problems such as you do. Maybe you should just look for a better apartement.

You measure standard of living based on the personal luxury goods of an individual.

How do you pay for the housecleaners? How much money do they make? I think what you mean is that the OP would have a higher living quality in America, because the house cleaner would have such an incredibly low living standard....

&gt;central heating and air conditioning

All houses in Germany are equipped with central heating. Air conditioning is seen as wasteful and ecologically damaging by most Germans and the government. (And it's true.) 

&gt;These homes come standard with washer and dryer, dishwasher, garbage disposal. Garbage is picked up regularly, including recycling.

That's usually the case in Germany, too.

&gt;The streets are clean even though they pick up the bottles from you instead of needing to return them. 

Uhmm... that depends on your definition of clean. Have you ever been to any American city? I mean, seriously... come on.

&gt;These Americans live in much larger spaces, as well, than their European counterparts, and they generally have a yard instead of being directly on the street.

Germans, too... I don't really see your point here.

&gt;Don't be offended by my post

We are not offended, we are just confused because what you say doesn't really reflect on why you consider the American standard of living higher. :/

The motto in Germany is: Just because you can doesn't mean you should. I think your perception of what ""quality of living"" means is severely differing from the German point of view.

The laws in Germany/the EU are VERY much in favour of your tenants.

If a tenant wrecks your apartement you can bet that you are the one who has to pay in the end.

Also: Most tenants want to bring their own stuff anyway, that means the furniture you provided would only be in their way and you would ahve to pay for transport, etc.

If a tenant doesn't pay rent, he can still stay in your home. You mustn't kick him out, except for a good reason (you, your spouse or your children need the place to live themselves and have nowhere else to go OR the person physically attacked you or is a danger others or him/herself). If he/she just isn't paying rent, you can sue him/her but the legal process can take many months. The rent he/she didn't pay will ONLY be part of the legal process and paid back to you if the tenant actually has the money. If the tenant can't afford the rent but have a legal contract, you are stuck with a person who doesn't pay you for several months and might ""unintentionally"" wreck your apartement as much as he/she desires.

This state is built upon the concept of caring for others and always being in favour of those who are least fortunate.

If you earn a lot of money, you pay a lot of taxes, etc. 
That works very well and provides for an incredibly high living standard for *everyone*. On average you can expect that every German citizen is very well off and doesn't ahve to worry about a thing.

Most fundamentally, one of the biggest drivers behind anything central in Europe is the fact that the more stuff you have in common, the less likely you are to go beat on each other, as Europe's been wont to do throughout history.  I don't entirely buy that argument, since most countries have by now figured out that selling bananas to each other is more profitable than invading Poland for fun on weekends, but there's always the chance that Grand Fenwick will get a little power-drunk and do something silly with its Q-Bomb arsenal...

Others are just silly, examples of what I call ""powerpoint mentality"" -- i.e. centralization/standardization looks great on a piece of paper, but in practice turns into a lumbering inefficient behemoth.

_Edit^2:_ On re-reading this, I thought I should clarify something.  I do not oppose the EU on principle.  I think some aspects of it are a great idea that mesh very well with my concepts of confederate government.  

What I don't like about it is its size, cost, and inefficiency, its one-size-fits-all approach to laws governing such a huge disparity of countries, its inconsistency, selectiveness, and inability when it comes to enforcing some of its policies (like the peace &amp; stability pact), its occasional bursts of ""you can't trust the voters"" undemocratic silliness (e.g. the noise every time a right-wing government is elected anywhere, the frustration about popular referendums shooting down the original constitution, its pretense to being a government, its redistributionism, and a few other aspects.  

That does not, however, discredit the fundamental idea, nor the value of many of its institutions.",0,1296116879,null,0,true,0,c1edwmv,t3_f96vc,t1_c1edwmv,t1_c1edu75,1426722289,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,Trem_r,null,null,"1/ Comment les français voient les USA ?

On peut dire qu'il y a deux tendances, d'un coté beaucoup de notre culture est américaine, surtout pour les gens de moins de 40 ans, cela dû au cinéma, à la musique, et à la télévision, donc on ne peut pas nier que les français sont friands de tout ce qui vient des USA, même de la nourriture car McDonald's en France est le 2e plus gros marché de la marque, ça marche très bien ( http://www.arretsurimages.net/vite.php?id=5986 ). D'un autre coté, la France est assez protectionniste avec sa propre culture (la fameuse Exception Culturelle française), et une grande partie de la population est plutôt hostile aux américains et à tout ce qui vient de l'autre coté de l'Atlantique, par principe et par conviction politique, par exemple le rapprochement de Sarkozy avec les USA après des années d'écart est très critiqué au sein de la gauche.
Au quotidien, j'ai surtout remarqué que les gens sont plutôt condescendants envers les américains, je vais en voyage régulièrement aux USA, et à chaque fois que j'en parle à quelqu'un, j'ai droit le plus souvent à des yeux ronds et levés vers le ciel, et une remarque sur l’intérêt d'aller faire du tourisme dans ce pays, je m'attendais pas à recueillir autant de remarques négatives de gens qui écoutent en majorité de la musique anglophone et lisent de la littérature américaine, mais c'est tout le paradoxe du français, il est très curieux et ouvert sur les cultures étrangères, mais il aime préfère manger un bon fromage et un boire un bon vin français, car ce qui vient de chez nous, c'est quand même mieux !
Il est quand même très difficile de tracer un dessin général de la relation qu'ont les français avec l’Amérique, il y aurait de quoi faire quelques livres tant celle-ci est complexe !

2/ Quelles musiques aiment les français ? Livres, TV ?

Si on en croit les meilleures ventes de disques, à peu près la même musique que toute l'Europe et le Monde, du David Guetta, Lady Gaga, Rhianna, du rap ... Et leurs équivalents en français. Pour info il faut savoir que nous avons des lois sur un quota d'oeuvres françaises à diffuser à la radio, cela incite donc le public à écouter de la musique en français.
Niveau livres, il y a une très productive et très commerciale littérature française qui fonctionne très bien. De gros écrivains qui vendent comme des petits pains des oeuvres pas très poussées niveau qualité mais qui font un carton, Marc Levy, Anna Gavalda etc.
A la télévision .. et bien comme partout, ce sont les séries policières gens CSI, Cold Case ... qui font les plus grosses part d'audience, quand ce ne sont pas les matches de Football (soccer) !
Ceci pour le coté très commercial et très grand public. Comme partout dans le monde, Internet change un peu ça pour la jeune génération, j'en parlerai dans mon prochain chapitre.

3/ Que font les adolescents français pendant leur temps libre ?

INTERNET, internet, MSN, des jeux vidéos, de la musique, des films, trainer avec leurs amis, du shopping, du sport. Internet est quand même devenu très important, et permet aussi aux adolescents d'avoir accès à beaucoup plus de contenus culturels variés, et à tendance à remplacer la télévision. Les jeunes écoutent de la musique téléchargée, et regardent des séries tv américaines en streaming. Les sports principaux sont le Football (soccer), le tennis, le rugby, et des sports de combat.

4/ Quel est le stéréotype français que vous détestez ?

Loin de le détester, il n'y a pas plus faux que le stéréotype du mime. Personne ne fait du mime, personne n'aime les mimes, personne ne connaît de mime en France. Pour la baguette, c'est vrai, le béret, c'est vrai aussi encore bien qu'en perdition, la marinière, c'est le vétement numéro des jeunes filles, l'accordéon fait partie de notre patrimoine culturel.
Les histoires d'hygiène sont aussi plutôt étranges, j'ai plus vu de filles aux aisselles poilues aux USA qu'en France (il faut dire que j'ai trainé dans le Tennessee et l'Alabama).
Pour ce qui est de l'amour, la mode et la modestie, TOUT EST VRAI.

I can only speak for myself, but I was the ""foreign"" kid in a small village, and both my parents were teachers, so they bought me a lot of history and general knowledge books for me to amuse myself with.  Some of my teachers in high school were awesome and very thoughtful, and most of my friends are pretty brainy types who love to debate.  &lt;3

My college degree was really improvised, consisting of international relations, history, and economics, so that helped; my university had a great series of classes called ""Political Economy of Industrialized Societies"" from which I got a few great bits of reading.  Combine that with living in a very politically left-leaning environment where you'd get in arguments and have to shoot down stupid, misinformed people a lot, and you get a strong motivation to stay reasonably informed, or to at least be able to make other people think that you know what you're talking about.  Bring a shovel.

I also recently did an MBA, but that was mostly oversimplified bullshit, and its main effect was to piss me off and get me to look things up so I could argue better in classes.  Wikipedia, IMHO, is the greatest thing ever invented (next to thongs and toy remote controlled helicopters, of which I am in awe, but that's a different story).

""lol""

I got a job as a sysadmin straight out of college, because I'd wasted my time knob-dicking around with unix boxes instead of studying.  The only thing I could have even remotely used my know-how for, given that my grades stank and no consultancy/investment bank would have taken me, was something like government service, teaching, or a law internship, none of which was even remotely of interest (how awesome to graduate and then realize that your degree is useless for any jobs that appeal to you, huh?)

Business school was an experiment to get the hell out of IT, which failed miserably, as we graduated into the teeth of this recession -- despite having a diploma from a super duper Big Important School, I couldn't find a job that paid nearly as well, or that exposed me to nearly as little stupid corporate politics as what I know well (security risk management consulting and incident response) so I went back into that.

Don't get me wrong, I am enormously grateful for my education; most of the people who spout on reddit about how college/grad school is not worth it are uninformed and silly.  It's exposed me to fascinating people, places, ideas, and ways of thinking/working, and probably turned me into the individual I am, capable of doing all the things I've done with my life.  But in terms of directly applicable skills, very little.

Which brings me to your startup question -- I have dealt with many of these, some more successful than others, and I think the skills required can be learned on your own.  I'm not doing it as my main thing right now due to the opportunity cost, and the fact that I've had a pretty chaotic life over the past 5 years and want to enjoy some peace and quiet for a bit. :)

If you partner with someone with a ""business"" background, you shouldn't do it because they have an MBA, but because they're smart, motivated, maybe a bit experienced, and you can work with them / trust them.

My main advice would be to keep a long-term goal in view, to not get stuck on details (i.e. do whatever works and don't be afraid to improvise), delegate, be prepared to fail, etc.  My biggest fuckups have come from spending too much time focuses on small elements that could easily have been circumvented.

You have been blessed. Most folks go to schools that actually seem to give education that you are able to self-teach yourself, let alone do they teach the students to think.

Excellent suggestions. I'm pretty anxious on this one, as compared to the first, it could turn out into a something serious, and hopefully because of that there will be less dicking around as well.

no the original idea was to stop the disastrous wars that have blighted the continent for centuries. and that should also answer the first misguided policy advice of yours.

depends how central the command is. Europe has many regional and sub-regional 'commands', making it quite resilient.

that said, i think you can improve on your situation by reaching out to an organisation specialized in manageing overseas assignments. you are probably getting ripped off on your appartment, and lost lots of money on the real estate agent, those are basically a scam, but depending on location they have monopolies.

there *are* furnitured appartments available (just not too frequently) and often hotels, especially smaller ones, may cut good deals for mid-term stays. what you did is the hardcore version of renting, which is a pita even for native germans.

forget air condition. true it is not well accepted, but if you avoid appartments directly below the roof you will be fine. there is no place in germany where it gets up to 40 degrees. 35 is rare and only in the high season. make sure your heating is properly maintained, as utilities are expensive and break/fix activities must be paid by the landlord anyway.

forget about quiet hours, just apply common sense. up to 10pm anything is fine. avoid noon to 3 on sundays as well and things are perfect.

from what i've seen in the US, living standards are comparable or even higher in Germany. again, you are probably getting ripped off. once you leave the appartment, try to sell the washer and dryer to your successors or ask a coworker to sell it for you. that way you can redeem some money.

just get out of that appartment and you will like Germany again. you just made one mistake up front which set you up on the wrong foot. what you need is a place with good facility management. it may be better to pay 50% more for a hotel where they will take care of everything than trying to become a native the hard way",0,1296158265,null,0,false,0,c1efqg5,t3_f7jmp,t1_c1efqg5,t3_f7jmp,1426723142,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

For the most part, American history has been one of frontier-ism, and individuality.  Even during our Revolution, we had concerns about native attacks, and did experience some of them.  At the same time, the majority of our army during that revolution were volunteers and militia enlisted for short periods that famously are called Minutemen.

We wrote into our Bill of Rights the right to own firearms for two reasons.  The first was personal protection.  Only the easternmost coastal areas were clear of natives so there was not any threat.  However the largely empty (of European settlement) areas were full of natives who weren't exactly friendly (which they had good cause for).  In this, the government felt a firearm was necessary to protect ones farm.  The second reason was also that our independence largely comes from those Minutemen volunteers, who kept and maintained their own weapons.

It was not until the very beginning of the 20th Century that our frontier was ""closed.""  All the way up until this period, one needed a firearm to protect themselves in certain parts of the U.S. against natives as well as some pretty dangerous wildlife.  Even to this day in some of the western states, you don't go off into the woods without a gun to defend yourself against animals.  

This 130 year or so period helped develop firearms into the American mindset.  We began to equate firearms with personal freedom, as one could simply get on a horse and ride off into the wilderness to find ones own fortune and freedom...as long as he had a gun to keep himself safe.  

The idea that guns equate personal freedom became very entrenched into our identity.  America was born with free speech and protest, so while we treasure it, we don't have the same values behind as many European states where historically freedom of speech and protest was not allowed, that's why you more than likely treasure it more than we do in a relative way, though we still value it.  

In a way, for example, your rights as workers, your right to speech is your hot button in many countries.  Whereas the Europeans will protest like crazy over workers benefits and education costs because of the long history in Europe of oppressed workers which many states overcame during the 19th and 20th Centuries, Americans get up in arms about guns.

How many of your friends and acquaintances get very worked up and begin to get a little rhetorical and radical, and lets face it a little angry and begin to say amazingly ignorant and stupid things about their rights in those issues and wonder why Americans aren't as worked up about it?

American's are the same way about their guns.  It is such an ingrained idea of who we are as Americans that we begin to start talking out of our asses in some ignorant ignorant ways.
