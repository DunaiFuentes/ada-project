Hast du vielleicht die Farbmarkierungen verwechselt? 

Ein ""Netz"" gibt es für 160 km/h Höchstgeschwindigkeit, teilweise sind dort auch 200 oder gar 230 möglich.

Was es für höhere Geschwindigkeiten gibt sind einzelne Strecken, wie z.B. Kassel-Würzburg, bzw. Streckenabschnitte, wie auf der Schnellfahrstrecke Hannover–Berlin zwischen Oebisfelde und Berlin-Staaken.  

Der finanzielle, planerische, bauliche, und sicherheitstechnische Aufwand für Hochgeschwindigkeitsverbindungen ist beachtlich. Bis da ein ganzes regelrechtes Netz zusammenkommen kann dauert es. Ob die Milliarden bei der Bahn nicht an anderer Stelle sinnvoller investiert werden könnten ist die Frage.

Der Artikel deckt sich mit meiner Erfahrung. Glenn Beck argumentiert nicht, er behauptet, dramatisiert, malt schwarz-weiss. Das ist immer sehr simpel gestrickt und leicht durchschaubar; Anhänger von Glenn Beck sind meines Erachtens ebenfalls sehr simpel gestrickt (die gelegentlichen Anrufer wirkten so).

Am Flughafen las ich in sein letztes Buch rein, ""Arguing with Idiots: How to Stop Small Minds and Big Government"". Eine beliebige Seite aufgeschlagen, Zusammenhang zwischen Schulergebnissen und staatlicher Förderung von Schulen anhand des meistgeförderten und des wenigst geförderten Staates. Die Argumentation war einfach und holzschnittartig, nur genau die Daten wurden präsentiert, die seine Behauptung stützen.

Selbst wenn man annimmt, dass bei Betrachtung *aller* Daten Becks Hypothese besser gestützt wäre: Weitere Erklärungsversuche gab es nicht. Mir fielen gleich mehrere alternative Erklärungsmöglichkeiten ein.

&gt;Bahnpreise: Bahn fahren muss bezahlbar bleiben!

&gt;Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband kritisiert Preiserhöhungen der Deutschen
Bahn AG

&gt;10.10.2006 - Der Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband (vzbv) hält die von der
Deutschen Bahn AG angekündigten Erhöhungen der Fahrkartenpreise für falsch
und unnötig. ""In Zeiten steigender Energiepreise brauchen wir eine
attraktive und günstige Bahn - mit Preissteigerungen von fast sechs Prozent
aber beschädigt die Deutsche Bahn AG ihre eigenen Wachstumschancen"",
kommentierte vzbv-Vorstand Prof. Dr. Edda Müller die heute veröffentlichten
Pläne der DB AG.

Was deine Vergleiche betrifft:

In den USA ist die Bahn v.a. Gütertransporteur, als solcher aber recht erfolgreich. Passagierverkehr wird von der Staatsgesellschaft [AMTRAK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak) betrieben, deren Fahrgastzahlen in den letzten sechs Jahren beständig gestiegen sind. 

Sei versichert, das politische Umfeld für eine quasi-öffentliche Eisenbahngesellschaft in den USA ist wesentlich feindlicher als in Deutschland, Gelder fließen zäher. Trotzdem hat sich AMTRAK gut geschlagen, verglichen mir der viel besser finanzierten DB.

Im UK ging nach der Privatisierung auch nicht alles besser, ebenso wie in Deutschland. Oft genug hieß das Ergebnis für die Kunden: [weniger Leistung für mehr Geld.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatisation_of_British_Rail) Es gab einige hässliche, und vermeidbare, [Unfälle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_rail_transport_in_Great_Britain_1995_to_date) 

In jedem Fall: die Deutsche Bahn wird nicht dadurch besser, das es anderswo noch schlechtere Eisenbahnen gibt. Wenn es, wie die zitierte Untersuchung der Stiftung Warentest festgestellt hat, bei 38% aller Fernverbindungen Verspätungen gibt, dann werden Passagiere auf die Forderung: *Hört endlich auf zu jammern* antworten: *Wir hören auf, Bahn zu fahren*.

&gt;While the tear gas was still hanging in the streets of Tunis, many pundits were quick to christen Tunisia’s revolution. Andrew Sullivan has asked (again) whether it’s a Twitter Revolution. Elizabeth Dickinson, among others, speculated in “Foreign Policy” that it might be a “WikiLeaks revolution.” Anonymous, the online activists who recently attacked targets perceived to be against WikiLeaks, claimed it as their own after their DDOS attacks on various government targets. For cyber-utopians, the unfolding events in Tunisia and the role of social media, was a cause célèbre [..]. 
&gt;
&gt;First off, it looks like social media did have an important role to play here. An estimated 18 percent of Tunisia’s population is on Facebook and, left unblocked by the government, it was a place where many Tunisians shared updates pertaining to the protests. As Ethan Zuckerman has pointed out, the video-sharing sites Dailymotion and YouTube were also important. And with a paucity of on-the-ground media coverage, Twitter excelled as a medium in getting the message out, in driving mainstream media coverage, and in connecting activists on the ground with multipliers in the West.
&gt;
&gt;Revolutions, of course, are notoriously slippery customers to evaluate. As Juan Cole writes, ""Revolutions are always multiple revolutions happening simultaneously."" It's difficult enough looking at revolutions from years ago and attributing relative importance to each of the many factors, let alone when people are still on the streets and chaos reigns. When you look at the complex mix of factors in Tunisia -- the economy, a frustrated over-educated, unemployed middle class, the trade unions, rampant censorship and government corruption, and, yes, social media -- establishing a single cause for the revolution, especially for something as marginal for most Tunisians as WikiLeaks, seems preposterous. If there is a need to apply a single cause and moniker for the events in Tunisia, it would make as much sense to call this the “Mohamed Bouazizi Revolution,” after the man who set himself on fire a few weeks ago to protest the government. But that too would be overly simplistic.
&gt;
&gt;As the events in Tunisia continue to unfold they will be ripe for study by academics and experts, but in so quickly applying our theories of social mobilization, or our frameworks of revolutionary change, we become blind to what is really happening. As Evgeny Morozov’s makes clear in his recent book, by over-focusing on the technology, we lose sight of what’s really important. 
&gt;
&gt;The problem is that we so desperately want there to be a Twitter revolution. In a 24-hour news cycle, we don’t just seek instant news but instant answers, clear explanations and narratives that can be book-ended with events and wrapped up into a three-word headline. At first it is just a catchy headline beloved of journalists in need of page views, but quickly that moniker becomes a narrative, an established truth that is often wildly divergent with the reality on the ground.
&gt;
&gt;In our search for a single cause, we're much more likely to settle on an ""new technology"" explanation rather than something as dull as a great many of the participants were unemployed or wearing socks. Not only do ""Twitter revolution"" explanations mean more page views, but they fulfill some deterministic urge within us -- the dual promises of technology and modernity. [..] 
&gt;
&gt;More than that, Twitter revolution narratives are popular because rather than being about Tunisia, they are often really about ourselves. When we glorify the role of social media we are partly glorifying ourselves. Some of us are not only praising the tools we know and love and use every day, but also the tools we build and have stakes in. To proclaim a Twitter revolution is almost a form of intellectual colonialism, stealthy and mildly delusional:  We project our world, our values, and concerns onto theirs and we shouldn’t. We use Twitter and so must they. In our rush to christen the uprising, did we think to ask Tunisians what they wanted to call their revolution?

With the Lublin Union of 1569, Poland and Lithuania formed a new state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Commonwealth lasted more than two centuries, until neighboring countries systematically dismantled it from 1772 to 1795, with the Russian Empire annexing most of Lithuania's territory.

On my part, it's ignorance. My problem though is that lots of your culture is quite inaccessible to me, because of your language. It's harder for me to enjoy a Hungarian movie (even with subtitles - which I've actually done) than a French one. My French isn't great, but I can at least understand a funny movie somewhat. A documentary (something I love watching) is even harder in a foreign language. French is quite easy to understand as a foreigner. Slavic (?) languages are just beyond me. 

Please fix this by posting awesome stuff about your country. Educate people you meet about your country. Don't be angry, be happy to have a chance to teach people stuff. And please, don't spare your harsh opinions. Our media may not always bring the success stories from your country, and perhaps there are reasons for this. Your personal opinion is valuable in the sense that the bad news show we see in the media isn't very accurate. If we can compare your gripes and stories with those in the media, we get a clearer picture.

Well I don't feel like a walking Ad for my country. I mean.. if someone wants to know something they should use the internet or a library.

Usually I would correct someone if they have heard false information about Bulgaria. Most people think we write in Cyrillic because of the Soviet Union and because Russia has imposed this Alphabet in many countries; and I tell them that regardless of the origin of the alphabet Bulgaria was the first country to utilize and officially develop it, and that Russia started using it much, much later. I think that is important because it's of our identity and also sooner or later there is going to be Euro currency circulating with the word [EURO in Cyrillic](http://i.imgur.com/M1HTQ.jpg) next to the Latin and Greek one; and I believe lots of people are going to go bananas over *""Why do we have Russian on our money?!?!?!""*

I'm not an expert on the subject of backpacking in Bulgaria but in comparison with the EU average we are way [less densely populated country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EU_Pop2008_1024.PNG) with a lot less infrastructure which means there's more wild places to go to. In the summer you can meet quite a few dread-locks-sandals-smelly Americans walking around the mountains and beaches. And it's a lot safer compared to other countries with so much wild areas too. Don't expect people to always be nice but I can give you a hint - tell any Bulgarian you're a westerner and you think Bulgaria has a long, rich and beautiful history * ***trollface*** * much better than the neighbor countries'... and they will shower you in hugs, love and homemade brandy (disclaimer: you can use this same strategy in virtually any of the neighboring countries.. always works perfectly).

For many centuries they were slaves for the nobility in Balkans - yes, they are not only on Romanian territory,  but rather in the whole Central and Eastern Europe. They kept to themselves and most of all they kept their culture (yes, they have one) and they way of live. And they continue doing so even now - this contributes to high poverty rates and low to 0 education among them.

I do not particularly like them - I was robbed both while in Romania and while traveling in Western Europe by some Roma children - but I am aware than they can be integrated into society only through continuous effort made by all countries they live in and, after all, they are not all alike. I'm sure some of them are highly educated and talented persons.

As a final comment, I also do not agree with the term ""Roma people"" (this was taken in the last 20 years both after Italy's capital and as a slap in Romania's face because the country's short name on official papers is either ROM from ROMania or ROU from ROUmanie).

Here is a comment I wrote a few months ago on this:

&gt;There are a number of itinerant groups in Europe. They're not closely associated, if at all; and there are a number of words that refer to them, many considered derogatory. Most of these groups have a long history in certain countries, and are treated slightly differently throughout Europe.

&gt;Mainland Europe has the [Roma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people) and the [Yaniche](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeniche_(people\)), also called Gypsies. The UK and Ireland has the [Irish Travellers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_travellers) (as seen in [*Snatch*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snatch_(film\)), and are also called gypsies  as they have a similar lifestyle and reputation). Also in the UK and parts of Europe are the [New Age travellers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age_travellers), who are similar to the [Rainbow Family](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Family) and sometimes mistaken for Irish Travellers or Roma, but have no strong link to them. These are the biggest groups, although others exist.

&gt;These are groups of people who don't integrate with society through choice, and earn the majority of their income through the black market. This can be by offering cheap and untaxed labour, selling goods they produce, collecting scrap metal, running fairs or festivals (especially the New Age travellers and Carnies), or by begging and theft. 

&gt;The Roma, Yaniche and Irish Travellers are very insular groups. They usually only marry within their communities. Marriages can sometimes be arranged and are usually during the early teens. 

&gt;Most of the groups are nomadic, and see this as their birthright. They have a reputation for [settling illegally on land until evicted](http://www.dublinpeople.com/content/view/3809/57/), and another reputation for [leaving the area covered in litter and/or sewage](http://www.thewestonmercury.co.uk/content/twm/news/story.aspx?brand=Westonmercury&amp;category=newsNorthSomerset&amp;tBrand=westonmercury&amp;tCategory=znews&amp;itemid=WeED28%20Sep%202010%2014:25:23:363). Many also have the literal belief in a [God-given right to thieve from others](http://ftp.fortunaty.net/com/sacred-texts/neu/roma/gft/gft021.htm).

Food standards have certainly improved, regulary to the chagrin and alarm of anti-EU newspapers in each state. The common labour market generally tends to be seen as a great thing in poorer states and a bad thing in the old Europe, despite its frequent need of a functional underclass - although poorer countries sometimes lose their very skilled workers.

They provide a lot of obscure **subsidies and grants**.  We had a roundabout built nearby, paid for by the EU - why?  It's for local traffic, and Luxembourg isn't a poor country.  Same for the local water tower.


On the other hand, they've also been taking a lot of money recently - 200m for Greece, for example, which is more than the cost of our city tram project, now likely to be postponed until Greece repays (haha).


Within the EP, the national governments all seem to fight their own weasely corners - the French introduce rules that favour French farmers and banks, Italy tried to have the state pension schemes merged to bail out theirs, etc.  The exception is, to some extent, Germany, which gets shafted every year in the EU budget, and has always paid more than its fair share of the cost of the EU.  The Brits were the same until Maggie Thatcher re-wrote the rules for their participation.


The **euro** seems a mess.  It was promoted for political reasons - the economic advantage of not having to change francs into guilders or marks never seemed worth the obvious problems of trying to make 17 different economies march in step.  It doesn't seem like a strong reserve currency in its current form.


The **bank bailouts** are also a mess.  At least the US deals with them consistently, whereas in the EU you have Germany letting some of them go to the wall (or get bailed out by shareholders), and yet still constrained to finance Greek and Irish bailouts of banks it would never have let survive in its own country - makes no sense.


Apart from the extra costs and single currency, the EU is known for **excessive(?) and zealous regulation**.  Why do we need a EU-wide standard for how long we can keep yoghurt?  It can't be the same north of the Arctic Circle as in Southern Greece.  Why do we have rules about the curvature of cucumbers and bananas?  (Banana rule has since been abrogated.  I guess you could say it was ... [takes of sunglasses] 'repeeled').

Why did the EU have to change the size of a glass of beer - are tourists confused about the quantity of beer they are drinking?  Why do they have to define what beer is - can't we have local rules for these things?


**Good points ...**


Free movement of labour is probably a good thing for unqualified workers, but we already had labour movement for qualified employees before the rules were in place.


Some EMPs say the EU has prevented wars, which is a good thing, if it's true.

true,almodozo,null,null,"Instead of writing an overlong comment about my opinions about the EU, why it's good overall but flawed in many of its day-to-day practices, I'm thinking about a couple of concrete ways in which it impacts my personal life...

* This is speculative, but I think that without an EU, Europe wouldn't have experienced the long absence of major warfare it's been enjoying, on the whole. I mean, it's pre-EU track record wasn't great in that respect. It does seem to have helped neutralize old rivalries and power struggles and channeled them into non-violent, bureaucratic venues instead. But obviously there's many ""parents"" to our current peace - economic prosperity, the Cold War (paradoxically enough), etc, so it would be foolish to credit the EU alone. But it does seem to help channel intra-European tensions into more manageable forms.

OK, that wasn't very concrete. Let me try again:

* I moved from my home country, the Netherlands to another country, Hungary. Emigration was smoothed over a lot by my being a fellow-EU citizen. Much easier to get a residency and work permit. And I came here when Hungary was already in the EU, but not yet in the Schengen-zone; it would be a lot easier still now.

* I can vote in local elections here and still vote in national elections back home.

* As a student, I benefited from one of the EU-funded student exchange/scholarship programs.

* EU regulations have forced, for random example, telecom companies to make things like switching contracts and keeping your number cheaper and have clamped down on excessive roaming rates. They've also stopped companies - from media owners to, say, banks - from developing monopolies, which has helped keep prices down. They've yielded some uniform worker protections, health and safety regulations, all kinds of stuff like that, which were absent or of lower quality in part of the EU before. 

* On the other hand, other EU regulations (deficit rules for example) have decreased the leeways of governments to pursue their own spending policies, and have forced governments to cut social services and spending when otherwise they may have followed more Keynesian spending-in-recessions policies. They've also pushed governments to privatize a lot of public utilities, not always to positive effect.

OK, that's getting far away from the concrete again. (Although ultimately, it does affect our pensions, unemployment benefits, etc. of course.) Ah, here's a concrete, specific example of EU regulation negatively impacting people I know: in the Netherlands, average-income people benefited from the availability of public housing with subsidized rents. But a new ruling from Brussels, if I understood the story correctly, has banned this practice as unfair competition with private housing companies and restricted the possibility to low-income households only. It is leading to skyrocketing rents in the average-price range.

* The EU has financially supported an enormous range of projects improving the infrastructure of the less-prosperous parts of the EU, including new member states such as Hungary. From highways to neighbourhood playgrounds, you can see the signs saying that they're only being built thanks to EU funding.

Hm. I'm finding it very hard to talk about the EU's impact in really personal, concrete ways instead of public policy terms! 

* I believe that some of the benefits I've accrued over the years (say, Social Security) in my home country will hold regardless of where in the EU I decide to live, for example if I'd stay here til old age. (That's a long time ahead though, God knows what will happen in this region before then.)

* There's no passport checks anymore when you travel from one country to another within the Schengen zone.

* The EU provides a lot of funding for policy-oriented academic research, and the university research center I work at has been a partner in several EU-funded international research consortia. So it's helping us reveal new data and insights (we hope) ... and paying for part of my wages. :) 

* The Hungarian government has been unfolding a very restrictive new set of laws on journalism and media regulation, this past half a year. The European Commission has vowed to review whether any of it can be shown to violate EU law. Let's hope they find a way to demand the repeal or amendment of some of the new legislation - it they do, that's another way the EU's proven itself useful, forcing member states to stick to some basic European values of democracy, free speech etc.

It's just lots of stuff like that ... The EU is just kind of there.

Firstly, we take up most of the legislation through the EEA agreement. Second, also due to the EEA agreement, we have access to EU funds at almost the same level as EU members. This is used by civil society, local government units and the general public all over society, although usually you'd never notice it unless you're specifically looking for the little logos you always find on publications they support. As an example, young Icelandic artists and youth organisations  have benefitted greatly from the Youth in Action programme.

The EU also affects us because we are part of the Schengen - essentially an EU institution, that som EU countries have opted out of, and that some non-EU countries have been allowed to join. This means that we can travel not only visa-free but also passport-free to most of Europe, something we hardly even think about anymore when we go abroad.

But what people have to realise is that European integration is also wider than the EU. The European Higher Education Area is much larger than the EU (although a lot of its activities are commission-funded), and it's because of this that we will f.ex. get our university degrees recognized anywhere in Europe. Through the Council of Europe (which is not the EU) we have a committment to democracy and human rights that's currently shaping the curriculum in our primary schools, and is also one of the reasons they're planning to close an outdated prison in downtown Reykjavík.

The list could go on, but the point I'm making is that even if Iceland isn't a part of the EU, we're very much affected by various parts of European integration - including the EU.

My taxes are high - most notably VAT (directive 2006/112 requires a minimum of 15%).  European contributions also cost money, which comes from members' contributions.  The countries I generally live and work in are net contributors.

Travel and work permit issues are greatly simplified due to Schengen, Erasmus, and similar agreements, which I am happy about.  That is not strictly ""EU"", but related.

We're at peace.  This is a good thing.  This is not a result of the EU, but generally of the Europeans getting their heads out of their asses and realizing that doing business and not beating up on each other every 50 years was better for everything.  Rather, the EU is an outgrowth of this mentality.  In general, people talk more before doing stupid shit, that is a good thing.

Regulations and labor law are strong, raising the cost of business.  This can be a double-edged sword (e.g. hazardous materials laws that go overboard.)

The business climate is very nervous due to uncertainty about the fate of the Euro (thanks, little buddies down South.)

The European ""government"" itself is a wasteful, expensive, bureaucratic nightmare without much power.  You see in projects like Euronews the desire for the EU to present itself as a beneficial body.  The rotating presidency, generous European parliament expenses, parallel EC/EU bureaucracies, and other elements are more nuisances than anything, knowing that it's me paying for them.

It's very unlikely that Europe will ever be partitioned because it's taking a completely different path, but it's a fun idea to entertain.

In reality, none of the two scenarios are likely to happen (flanders/wallonia being annexed and Europe being partitioned), and I don't feel really comfortable with Belgium splitting if Flanders and Wallonia were to become autonomous self governing states.

The writer of the article, Ian Buruma, interviewed Bart De Wever more than anyone else, so it seemed like it was pro-Flanders and pro-split.  It also went on at length about immigrant problems in Brussels.  

The article made it sound like if there was a split, Flanders and Wallonia would have to be autonomous, and that whoever got Brussels would be viable, and whoever didn't would more or less be a failed state.  The article also indicated that a split is probably inevitable. It said Brussels is the ""child"" of Belgium, and that people outside it, from both Flanders and Wallonia don't really like it.

It seems our politicians are unable to reach a consensus on which a federal government could be build. However, a split is still not an option that is seriously considered since it would be an even harder way to a solution as trying to reach some kind of agreement.

In order to understand the whole situation you should read up on the history of Belgium, but that would bring us a bit far. In short, there is a dutch speaking part, a french speaking part and a bilingual part. Not only are they speaking different languages, it are also 2 different cultures (as to why, that's a whole other can-o-worms), with Brussels being a weird kind of mix.

A federal state was born and over the years a rather complex systems of different governments was formed where certain responsibilities were pulled away from the 'federal- national' level to the 'regional-level'. Over the years it went downhill with the walloon region as the heavy industry collapsed and it went better with Flanders which is more active in the booming service economy. A common theme was the 'waffel-iron' politics. Where, for everything Flanders asked and get a similar demand from the walloon region was met, and the other way around. Whilst a good idea to get negotiations going somewhere it's hardly fair since both 'parts' aren't created equal, not in number of inhabitants or economical numbers. Which lead the a growing frustration on the Flemish side as they feel they proportionally have to give too much too the walloons whilst getting not enough in return.

So, here today, Flanders has massively voted on a former small party which an extreme position on the whole Flemish vs Walloon affair. Now, as a little side-note to this, In Flanders it's only possible to vote on Flemish parties (the same goes for the walloon region) with the sole exception of a handful exceptions (brussels and all). So, while these politicians are negotiating at a national level, there electoral responsibilities are only on regional level. So getting the most out of the negotiations for their region is what matters for most, the 'health' of the national government doesn't seem to be that important for most. Especially since further splitting of responsibilities is on the agenda.

So, there we are. Totally stuck since both sides won't budge an inch and have totally oposite ideas. The king which needs to help on forming a government is probably on the brink of a major brake-down as every attempt to bring both sides close enough together seem to fail. 

A split however isn't on the table, as no-one would even know how to solve those issues. It's like a marriage where man and wife have grown apart and are now finding out their marriage is broken. But the house, kids (Brussels), common debts and furniture pose quite some problems in breaking up without a fight, but I don't think there is any commitment for a revolution. So we have to resort to the political equivalent of marriage counseling (being a king of Belgium can be quite a task so it seems) and talk our asses off.

I'll try to keep it short: 

Flanders wants to become more independent, largely because they are the richer part of the country and don't want to continue supporting Wallonia, even more so because of the big gap between both cultures.

During the last elections, which were in June, over 30% of the Flemish voted for the N-VA, a very Flemish-minded party that wants to move - among other things - budgetary matters from the federal level to the regional level (Wallonia/Flanders). However, this would bring trouble for Wallonia, as their social security costs are not affordable without the financial help of Flanders, which is largely why Wallonia is strongly against a split.

This is why, in Wallonia, more than 35% (was it 40%?) voted for the PS, a very socialistic party that doesn't want to split Belgium. After the elections, both elected parties (PS and NVA) had to sit together and try to form a government. N-VA wanted to introduce many reformations, but the PS judged them to be far too extreme. The jibber jabber has been going on for over 200 days now, and we're still practically nowhere.

**tl;dr Flemish want to pull more responsibility to Flanders and away from the federal level, but this would (probably) get Wallonia in financial trouble, so Wallonia doesn't agree. Flanders can't introduce any reformations without the consent of Wallonia.

&gt; The article also indicated that a split is probably inevitable.

If we are to believe everything the media says, a split has been inevitable since 1998. It's different, but comparable to North Korea threatening to nuke South Korea. Maybe someday it'll happen, but they've been going on about it for so long nobody is actually in suspense.

&gt; It said Brussels is the ""child"" of Belgium, and that people outside it, from both Flanders and Wallonia don't really like it.

I believe the Flemish could be a little disgruntled because Brussels has become very francophonized over time. Because of its special status (It's a bilingual region, the capital of Belgium, the capital of Europe, split into two regions, Brussel-Halle-Vilvoorde, ...) it's an administrative nightmare. Nevertheless it brings in a lot of cash through taxes, because a lot of businesses, industries, offices, ... are situated in Brussels.

&gt; If not, are you Flanders or Wallonian? Thoughts on De Wever?

Flemish. While some say De Wever is an extremist, he is definitely among the most intelligent people in the political environment right now. He has very clear visions and plans for Belgium, and is very vocal about them. Before the elections, he was 'victorious' during most debates, and I believe people voted for him because they wanted the change he envisions.

You could say there's a fine line between stubborn and resolute, but he hasn't caved in so far. He refuses to accept a watered down reformation that would not be beneficial to Flanders, even under international economic pressure. His latest suggestion, to only reform one specific aspect (but reform it completely) was met with rage and frustration from Wallonia.

Allow me to quote your article: 

&gt; The Flemings and the Walloons have their own political parties, newspapers, TV stations, novelists, and pop stars. But the issues dividing them are not just cultural or linguistic.

**Tl;dr: Flanders and Wallonia don't get alone, Flanders wants to split, Wallonia doesn't agree (which is ironic) so nothing happens, we're stuck in the status quo and while the country is on freeze the economy is slowly collapsing around us.**

Thoughts about De Wever? Well, they're kinda double sided. IMHO De Wever got the votes by virtue of being the only one that wasn't totally an extremist, an idiot or was part of the 'usual politicians' who failed in the last years to tackle any important political dossier (like migration, which is a huge problem). Basically he looked like a capable guy who would stand up for the Flemish 'cause' without selling out to the walloons. - In a side note you also need to know that the media in Belgium is separated by the language barrier and there is very little communication over the language barrier. It's not uncommon for the same events to be reported from totally different angles, especially about politics. People can have a totally different idea about what's going on depending whether they are reading the french press or dutch press (the international press kind of always miss the ball completely) - so about De Wever. Turns out he really doesn't 'budge' and that NVA is indeed a small political party with little to no experience on running a federal government. It's no secret he doesn't like Belgium and the old political way of working. And that's why he was elected off course. We had years of bickering politics who didn't seem to agree on anything, making every freaking little thing (even the colour of car license plates) an issue between the walloon and Flemish part immobilizing all important issues and basically the whole country.

true,TwoTwee,null,null,"I wrote this [blog post](http://blog.katania.be/2010/10/the-breakup-of-belgium/) not so long ago about why Belgium is not going to split any time soon. You can't break up a country if nobody can agree on how to split it up.

And the situation today is not as black and white as it may first seem. It's not just the Flemish against the Walloons, but also socialist against free market ideals on both sides of the language border. And to complicate things even more, there is Brussels.

If it was business as usual, putting together a new government really wouldn't be that difficult. Forming a coalition with a 51% majority would be sufficient. 

But most of the Flemish who voted right, are not necessarily asking to split the country, they just don't like the idea of their tax money flowing to the south without having any say in how it is spent over there. And with the general feeling that it isn't being used as effectively as it could, they want the system to change: The regions should be made financially responsible for how our tax payers money is spent. But the Francophones fear that more responsibility means a weaker federal government and a step closer to the break up of Belgium. So they are trying to slow the Flemish down as much as possible.

But as long as the Flemish don't give in, constitutional changes need to be made, and that requires a 2/3 majority. Unfortunately, that leaves us with just one or two viable formations.

The most realistic one is the current 7 party coalition ranging from far left to far right and everything in between. It's a coalition where some parties would normally not form a natural fit, but are now forced to work together. With agendas so far apart, getting everyone to agree on anything is difficult and very slow. And it's why it's taking so long to form a new government.

And this is just a simple explanation. The reality is that it is even a lot more complicated than this. But most of it has to do with money and how the political system has to be organized in the future.

Like everywhere in the world, an anti-immigration standpoint is an easy vote winner. While Brussels has a large influx of immigrants, most of these are from the EU and are highly paid professionals. These professionals and the French speaking Brussels Bourgeoisie have all left Brussels and have swamped surrounding communes. Most of them speak french or english. In a country like Belgium, this causes added problems, especially in Flanders where language is a very sensitive issue due to past oppression. 

I'm a fleming. As I work in Brussels, I rather like the place. However it is true that Brussels is largely devoid of Belgian people living there. However, this trend is reversing as gentrification occurs. In fact Flemish people are moving back to Brussels. Especially artistic and professional types.

Yes, Belgians complain about Brussels. But we like to complain about everything. We complain about immigrants, then hire them to fix up our drive at a reduced rate. We complain about high taxes and tax dodgers, but the average Belgian is imaginative in his of interpretation of (tax) law. The reality is Brussels is a cash cow.

At the moment this is under federal control. Meaning the federal state is responsible for paying and organising these fees. A proposal was made to bring the responsibility, and thus the financial aspect as well, to a regional level. Since unemployment is far higher in Walloon region then it is in Flanders this would cause a significant extra cost on the French side and a significant saving on the Dutch side. The same idea was put down for the healthcare, and has an equally beneficial result for Flanders.

The economic situation is more difficult to explain. The Walloon region had a long history of heavy industry (steel, mining, etc…) which slowly moved away to lower cost countries (eastern Europe, asia). Mines closed, big factories closed. By the eighties there was little left of what once made Wallonia a prosperous economy. As a result there was huge surplus of low educated workers and very little for them to do, and a sub-par educational system to go with it. Flanders who had gone though a similar economic turn a few decades earlier had in the meantime recovered and had build up a good running service economy supported by a good educational system so there were (and still are) many well educated employers available on the job market. As a result Flanders is doing far better economically then the Walloon region at the moment. However, there are clear signs that Wallonia is picking up the pace and are turning things around by providing a better investment climate for companies, whilst still being in the hearth of Europe.

Another example: the European Council and the Council of the European Union serve similar purposes, although nominally their roles are clearly defined.  

Furthermore, the High Representative, supposed to represent Europe abroad, did not have a clear brief for years, and frequently conflicted with the EU and EC Presidents in terms of responsibility.  I'm not even sure whether the HR has its diplomatic corps yet.  There is significant overlap with national foreign ministries as well.

true,matzo1991,BELG,Belgium,"Being primarily Belgian and then Fleming, I'm bound to be prejudiced. But here's my say:

Around my friends, I'm known as a Belgicist: someone who takes a too 'pro belgium' stance in every discussion. I'm faced with a lot of ignorant arguments and bullshit every time, every discussion.
However, I'm afraid that here I'll be seen as a Flemingant radical. And that's because, while I think it's a pretty analogy, I do think it isn't correct.

It's a nice idea, comparing Belgium to a marriage, but first off:
the marriage you describe is obviously what people would call a 'failed marriage'. It's even worse than the real political situation over here!

Secondly, your conclusion seems wrong. While I don't hold the opinion that accountability is the idea behind democracy, I'll take your word for it. 

However, the Walloons have nationalists too. Furthermore, you describe, quite accurately, the way French was the cultural major of the languages. Dutch was looked down upon, and nevertheless specifically point to the Flemish as 'one-dimensional people'. And is self-determination necessarily as bad as you make it sound? Is it bad when the South-Sudanese decide to continue alone? When Kosovo decides to leave Serbia behind? I'm nót pro 'the split', but I can genuinely understand that my ancestors decided they wanted their offspring, the children of two Dutch-speaking people, to be able to get their education in Dutch! They were not: until 1883 high schools where French only. In 1930, the first university (Ugent) became Dutch. 

Even [the constitution wasn't translated into Dutch until 1967](http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staatshervorming_(Belgi%C3%AB)). It was the secondary language in Belgium since 1898, all the while it was the language shared by 60% of the population. It's only because people sense that self-determination is an important principle, that we were able to convince the politicians (then mostly bourgeois, because they got to vote multiple times. It was only after WW I that every man, disregarding class, social or economic standing had one and only one vote) to grant us those rights.
In a democracy that could see past linguistic differences, they, with their 60 percent would simply form a majority.

However, the general feeling is that minorities should be protected in democracies, a feeling that I can understand and appreciate. But, while I feel it is important to prevent the Flemish part of Belgium from forcing laws upon Wallonia, I fail to see why we must protect a linguistic minority, but not the libertarian minority. (For example, the 'pro-gun-carrying minority against the anti-gun-carrying majority). It feels like a strange, stupid and wicked comparison, even to me. But I'm not NonsensicalAnalogy, I just can't come up with a rational reason.

(Please, do inform me if you have one! I could use it in all kinds of debates. It is possible that within a few decades, there will be European country with a muslim majority. Why shouldn't they be able to introduce the Sharia? They are the majority, only the separation of church and state would stand in their way. But doesn't this separation feel artificial to you? We feel that certain laws should be followed, they feel the sharia should be followed, where's the difference?)

This all to show that self-determination is an important principle. A principle that isn't always put to good use, but not a word or principle as dirty as you make it sound?

Third point:
You fail to capture the problem with Brussels. Both opinions have a point, and you could have a long argument, but at the very least the Flemish part of Belgium feels like Brussels used to be theirs and theirs only, and that they had to give it up to make the marriage work. To keep working in your analogy, you could say that the Flemish father at least feels like Brussels being an extramarital child with their Dutch mistress. Maybe it is, maybe it's not, but it's certainly the feeling that Flemish people share. It's a bit objectionable, because it shows us clinging on to the past, not putting those things behind us, but yeah... it's the common feeling.

Futhermore, your analogy fails to address the problems around BHV. In fact, the problems around BHV are nothing but a matter of principle, but they are nevertheless important.
The problem was created when the government reformed the voting procedures. There were a few facilitary municipalities: municipalities around Brussels that always were Flemish, but had a significant Walloon minority. They were granted all kinds of rights and accommodations so they could undertake their judicial procedures and their business with the government in French. However, mayors still had to abide the same conditions as in any Flemish municipality. They(=The french speaking inhabitants) were supposed to integrate (It sounds terrible, but you expect foreigners to take the time to learn your language, nobody should look down upon us when we expect the same from an (in that time something around 15%-20% I'm always told) minority to do the same!) but these municipalities instead attracted more Walloons who wanted to leave near but not in Brussels, because they could be served in their own language)
But hell, the Flemish knew the deal at the time, they took it (In order to pass some other very needed laws to make both parts more equal. They had to sweeten the deal because the french speaking minority is protected, as I told you earlier), they should live by the consequences.
However, when the voting laws where reformed, the french speaking minorities suddenly had the possibility to vote French speaking people into office. That wasn't part of the deal and, even more important, is in breach with the constitution. The Walloon reaction is: you can have your Dutch-speaking mayors, if you give us some other municipalities, effectively creating 'a corridor to Brussels'.

I'm sorry if my post features any factual inconsistencies of incorrect facts. While I favour Belgium and not Flanders, I'm still from Flemish upbringing, surrounded with pro-Flemish voices and I still watch the Dutch-speaking news channel. That is a recipy for indoctrination with lies, misunderstandings and 'omission bias'. I'm doing the best I can the see through those kind of things, but I'm but a man, I can fail. (Or even fail miserably...)

Please note that the metaphor is not mine, I have merely copied it from a journal article.  

The thing with national self-determination is that it's something that is indeed an important international principle.  It is even kind of mentioned in the UNDHR (article 23: ""The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government"").  But it's a vague one.  What makes up ""the people"", what is ""the nation"", how do we measure, who decides?  In practice, it has only been applied to developing countries and I don't think it bodes well for international political stability when it starts being applied to secessionist social groups in the West.

I can understand my ancestors as well, but we (as Flemings) are not in their shoes any more!

When it comes to your minorities argument I would really like to do it more justice by giving you a longer response because this is an important element of democracy, especially in relation to Belgium.  I don't really have the time for that right now though.  In brief, there are 2 models of democracy: 1. the majoritarian, which has majority rule as its principle (UK, USA) 2. the consensual, which aims to protect minorities by forcing them into alliances .  The first is criticised for not being very democratic, the second for being too democratic as it entrenches differences and can therefore lead to political instability.  Belgium has the 2nd but not just any variant of this, it used to be what Arend Lijphart coined as a ""consociational democracy"", which, if you are of the opinion that consensual democracy is too democratic, is the worst of all evils because it accepts social divisions and entrenches them even further.

true,matzo1991,BELG,Belgium,"Thank you. Maybe it is my classical upbringing, but I feel the majoritarian democracy as the more 'democratic' in the original sense of the word. Plato tells us that Socrates thought of democracy as 'the reign of the mediocrity'. Plato describes democracy as 'the dumb ruling over the smart'. I feel this statement does injustice to the majority but also holds some truth.

My personal view is that democracy is far from perfect, but that it's the 'best of the worst'. And as such, I think that if you choose for democracy, it is inherent to accept what the majority decides, no matter whether you like it, whether it is chosen by a cultural/ethnic/religious group or not.

I'm glad to read that I'm not the only one who thinks that 'consensual democracy' further entrenches social divisions, I'll look into that!

true,haraldreddit,null,null,"When the fundamental division occurred between political parties in Belgium, depending on their language, it reduced the federal concept to almost nothing. Belgians can only vote for a politician from the region they live in (except BHV, but thats another story) and this politician will eventually be part of the federal government. There is no Belgian Socialist party of liberal party, there is flemish liberal party and a walloon liberal party etc. Their political program focuses of course on the interest of the people from their region that vote for them (otherwize they don't get in power). So this has pushed the frenchspeaking people and the flemish more apart. Today, everything is already seen from a regional position but in the administrations its not yet structured that way, so that what they've been blabbering about for the last 200 days or even more, on how to reach a deal on this.

Now, these parties are also in power in Brussels (my city) and this is what pisses me off. Since there are no federal parties anymore, and everyone seem to mostly care for their region, I'd like Brussels to become politically more independent also. That doesn't mean that I think everything should be seperated, some federal competences would be normal (and splitting the country, I believe, would be too expensive for now). The reason I want parties specific to brussels is because I don't want the walloons nor the flemish politicians continue pushing their regional-minded agenda's into my town. 
My hope is to make of Brussels region a European Dictrict one day, within a the Belgian structure. That is why, working in that direction and also if I had time, I would create a party called Brussels European Party, with frenchspeaking and flemish speaking politicians or bilingual (and why not throw a German Belgian in there for the heck of it), but I gotta job already (and I should better get back to it now)...

The US spends less on social services, but the majority of the federal budget is nevertheless spent on entitlement programs like social security and healthcare for children and seniors. A state like New York actually pays for these services in a state like Alabama. But you are correct to note that US states, although being integral to the federal republic, are nonetheless sovereign and guaranteed a significant level of independence.

There are also massive infrastructure costs in the US. The US is large and mostly rural: roads, transit, energy, telecommunications, and so on thus cost more in the US than they do in denser countries.

Some Americans might think of themselves first in terms of their ethnicity (Mexican-American, Irish-American, African-American, and so on) and second in terms of their citizenship, but they are still largely loyal to the idea of the Union, perhaps precisely *because* it's the one thing that keeps the country together.",0,1295456472,null,0,false,0,c1dd0jv,t3_f4i4n,t1_c1dd0jv,t1_c1dcred,1426704490,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

It creates an imbalance. Consider the difference between New Jersey and Montana. One is a small (area-wise), densely-populated state; the other is a large, sparsely-populated state. When the federal government subsidizes Montana's infrastructure, people from New Jersey (along with the rest of the US) pays for it. It would be like Japan paying for roads in North Korea.

This kind of subsidization is even clearer in public transportation. Amtrak, the US' national railway, charges people on high-volume routes more for travel in order to subsidize the existence of low-volume routes. It ends up costing more for people to go by train from Boston to New York than it does to go from some small city to another small city.

&gt;And isn't the majority of the federal money spent on defense?

A common misconception. The US spends more on defense than any other country in the world, but it has a lot of tax money (and credit) to throw around: [see here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fy2010_spending_by_category.jpg).

19% is spent on defense; nearly 70% is spent on social services. The rest is spent on debt interest, bureaucracy, and infrastructure.

To put it in clearer terms, a state like New York gets back $0.50 for every $1.00 it spends in taxes; a state like Alabama gets back $1.50 for every $1.00 it spends in taxes. That kind of disparity adds up.

&gt;Anyway, due to our Waffle-iron politic (sort of a positive tit for tat. a road here, a road there. a bridge here, a bridge there) we now have these 2 beauties in Wallonia

We have the same problem in the US due to the nature of the US Senate, in which senators attempt to bring back as much money as they can to their home states, because they can add amendments to budgetary bills passed by the House.

Maybe this has an impact on the unemployment rate.

true,4nr-,BELG,4nr is short for wanker,"The fact that you think majoritarianism is more desirable is very much in line with what you have argued before and that you consider yourself Belgian above anything else.  I agree with you that majoritarianism is more democratic but I only in practice, not in principle.  If we are concerned with the whole of mankind, the fact that the two great empires of the past 200 years have been majoritarian democracies - the UK and the USA - it is quite easy to describe the international rise of democracy that has taken place.  Their form of government allowed them to be stable and export and promote democracy internationally.  Democracy has, however, been on the decline internationally in the past couple of years (cf. Freedom House).  

And yes, I agree with your sentiment (Churchill - “It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried.”).  I think democracy is desirable for three reasons: 1. Democratic countries do not engage in war with one another (democratic peace theory) 2. Democracy is the least oppressive form of government that has been tried so far.  3. It has brought prosperity and equality to the West and although equality has been on the decline since the 70s, I think it can have the same effect on the developing world.  

Nevertheless, we must be careful to not idealise democracy too much and we must distinguish between democracy as an ideal and democracy as it actually exists.  This is why I don't think it is wise to cite Plato.  Plato has been accused of being the one who brought about the culture of political blueprints as found in Marx and St. Augustine.  Marx culminated in the Soviet Union and St. Augistine helped bring about the middle ages.  A more pragmatic approach to politics is much more desirable and if you're classically inclined you can find this in Aristotle (The Politics, books III,IV,V).

When it comes to BHV, I think it is just another factor that complicates things by antagonising the communities even further.  To be able to overcome the crisis, Belgium must change its political discourse and stop discussing extremely complicated particularities.

I'm a 34 old German native and I'd like to know this, too.

Seriously: It's not always obvious, and it's changing. It used to be easy when it was stricter -- not too long ago you had to use *sie* with all adults, unless the more senior individual had previously offered the lower ranking the *du*, which is usually done while you have a drink. This still happens. One change the late 60's brought was the universal *du* between students.

Nowadays, you have to go by intuition. In a formal setting, you go by the formal rules. Everything government, administration, bureaucracy and finance is strictly *sie*. Business settings still lean heavily towards the *sie*, but it depends on the sector. Among co-workers, I'd say it's mostly *du*, but as you can see this is already where it gets difficult. Since recently salespeople are beginning to use *du* more often -- in some stores it's company policy, in others they go by said intuition. As a rule of thumb, in informal settings I use *du* with everybody roughly my generation and younger, depending on how conservative they seem and how they dress I make exceptions either way. *Sie* can be inappropriate as well, e.g., between two people my age at the bar.",0,1295475228,null,0,false,0,c1dek33,t3_f59cc,t1_c1dek33,t1_c1de1xy,1426705209,12,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,12

There are many subtleties associated with the use of ""du"" and ""sie"" that even many Germans do not fully understand.   Among adult people ""sie"" is the default.  ""Du"" is used among friends.  I can assure you that ""sie"" is not reserved for addressing superiors.  In a professional context you should always go with ""sie"" first except if there's an explicit rule saying otherwise.  (Unfortunately, it's the other way around in some professions.)  Sure, there's an inflation in the use of ""du"" which I find kind of sad because it strips ""du"" of its friendship connotation.  In a professional context you have to be very careful with that.  Many people will feel offended when you address them with ""du"" but wont show it.  This might create a hidden resentment against you that might harm you.  On the other hand it's easy to make people feel respected by addressing them with ""sie"", so you could see it as a powerful tool.  In any case, better be a bit too formal than too informal.  There's no rule, btw, saying that you can address younger people with ""du.""  When talking to children sure, but certainly not when talking to colleagues or customers.  If you didn't make such experiences so far this means that people were tolerant because they realized that you are not from Germany.

true,mhermans,null,null,"&gt; it's actually quite a good metaphor.

I take issue with the metaphor on two points:

* a ""nationalistic assumption"": the basic entities are regions (man/women). Other crucial divisions that shaped and continue to shape Belgium (e.g. workers-employeers, religious-secular) are ignored.
* a ""grasshopper-and-the-ant assumption"": one party is, due to a large part it's own fault ('her unwillingness to work') a burden to the other party.

This might seem nitpicking, but I think these conceptions are pretty fundamental, setting the outlines of the debate.

If you accept that the basic conflict is between two nationalist entities there can only be further debate on the modalities of their relation and small differences get reinforced until we get two ""camps"".

If you additionally accept the grasshopper-and-ant argument, that already strained relation can only deteriorate.

Instead of the nationalistic assumption, you can start from the assumption that the basic conflict is not nationalistic, but between workers and some transnational elite, or between secularism and fundamentalism, or some other non-nationalistic ideology.

Instead of the grasshopper-and-ant assumption, you can argue that socio-economic shifts (early industrialization, de-industrialization, etc.) and geographic contingencies (coal deposits, suitable harbours) the last 200 years have shaped the fortunes of the inhabitants of different regions. Which makes it difficult to argue for a reduction in solidarity (if the grasshopper is not responsible himself, the ant becomes just a mean, cold-hearted cheapskate).",0,1295528742,null,0,false,0,c1dhffb,t3_f4i4n,t1_c1dhffb,t1_c1d8yla,1426706602,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Safe? I think it is. I don't think you, or your wife, run a risk of being harmed.

I hesitate to answer that question because, as I'm reluctant to admit, you'll probably find it a tad harder to make friends with people than in Canada. The majority of your fellow students will be white Christians (not very religious, though), who will probably tend to keep with their kind (there will be exceptions, of course).
Since the majority of Muslims in Germany are of Turkish descent, and their parent or grandparents have come here doing mostly unskilled labour, there is still a noticeable ""class divide"" between Germans and Turks (or Germans of Turkish origin) with few points of contacts. This is the recently frequently mentioned ""Parallelgesellschaft"" (*parallel society*).

[This](http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/akademie/berlin/04705.pdf) is a study saying that only a quarter of male Turkish pupils are attending a school that will allow them to go to university later, the others have little chance or motivation of ever getting there.

So you'll probably have few fellow Muslim students, and you'll probably have to take the initiative if you want to befriend your German fellow students. Mentioning that you come from Canada will definitely help, I assume.

It's hard for me to write these lines as they don't show this country in the best light, but in my experience, that's what it's like.

It is true that it has increased in the past decade or so (thanks to 9/11 the war in Afghanistan and Iraq) but you probably wouldn't notice that big of a difference.  
Berlin is totally safe to go, like all mayor German cities (I dont know about Dresden and Leipzig, it wasn't as nice as any of the other big cities when I last visited).  
You have stronger racism (nowadays often hidden behind anti islamism) and xenophobia in very poor parts of the country like areas in the former GDR.  
Afaik it can be quite pronounced there but you won't have anything to worry about in any of the mayor urban areas.  
Stick to r/Germany and ask away if you have questions.
I think traffic and regular crime are more dangerous in Berlin ;)  
I live in a city in southern Germany and I have a lot of Muslim friends and colleagues (even though most are not that religious, they drink for example) that don't have any troubles living here (most of them are second generation Afghans and Turks, and one Iraqi, who fled the country almost a decade ago).  
You also have educated turks and people from other arabic countries meeting in bars (or coffee houses) and restaurants, just like every other social peer group, if you feel feel weird with your student buddies and want to blend in for an afternoon ;).

Really, part of the problem Roma minorities have had for centuries. All those who manage to make a social movement up never go back and the community doesn't benefit.

I as Bulgarian am not very eager to tell my place of origin because all people know about this place is that we're the poorest EU country and that everybody's a criminal. I like my country just as the next European but it's not the same for us as it is for them. We get some of the most ignorant bullshit you can hear about a group of people. 

A lot of times people would think I'm Belgian or Swiss based on my accent and when I tell them where I'm really from their sudden disappointment is very visible. That hurts, that really fucking hurts. ""I liked you before I learned that you were born in the wrong place"". I'm so sorry people but I can't change that, can we go on with our lives please?! Or when you tell people where you're from and they assume you're Borat* and start explaining stuff like a red light or what MTV or StarWars is. It makes any real conversation impossible. It's a downer but I've managed to live with it.. what you gonna do.. that's the reality of going abroad.

Sometimes a girl likes me and flirts back... it's all working perfectly and then comes the question ""Where are you from actually?"". It doesn't really take more than a minute for them to make an excuse and disappear after ""Bulgaria"". Maybe it's me.. maybe I like racist bitch types..

The thing about not telling people where you're from is really the better choice as you don't allow the person standing in font of you use any stereotypes to ignore your actual personality. You should stop pushing people that don't want to tell you something like that. Be polite ;D

(**EDIT: Disculpeme por utilizar la palabra ""castellano"" sin explicación.** Aquí en Catalunya, nadie dice ""español"" por que la gente catalán no se considera española, y prefiere llamar ""castellano"" la idioma de las regiones centrales de España.)

Pero no quiero disuadirte de escuchar grabaciones. Michel Thomas es bueno para las estructuras gramaticales, y Pimsleur para gramática y  también vocabulario, y pueden ser muy útil para poner palabras en tu cerebro, pero tienes que buscar una situación en que puedes practicar producirlos de este cerebro.

The first time I visited Berlin I asked a bus driver for directions; he explained to me which busses I had to take but I could hardly understand him; I repeated what he said and he seemed satisfied; only later did I realize that I had repeated typical Berlin words which did not actually contribute to the content (somehow like ""well"" and the like).

When visiting other parts of Germany, I don't try to speak their dialects. Everybody would hear that I'm not actually from that area. And there is not really the need to adapt to their ""language"". However, Germans living in other parts of the country will probably start using expressions that typical for their new homes.

Yep, different dialects and vocabulary all over germany. The cleanest, unaltered german is said to be spoken in the area around hannover and north of that. 

To ""Moin, Moin"" or rather just ""Moin"": This is really handy greeting because you can use it at every time (has nothing to do with ""morning"") and is quite neutral so you can use it for almost everyone.

This ""Grüß Gott"" is a mostly bavarian expression and afaik quite common there, but I would never use it if I would travel there. Not only not because it sounds ridiculous. I have never met anyone who willingly tried to adapt the regional idiom. When you stay with a party of people speking one dialekt you will find yourself adapting some expressions automatically after a few days, but thats all.

true,CountVonTroll,null,null,"&gt; For example, would a Berliner try to say ""Gruess Gott!"" when vacationing in Munich, and/or try to use a Munich accent?

No. S/he *might* use *Grüß Gott* in an attempt to adapt, or honestly adopt it after having lived there for a while, but never attempt to speak the local dialect, with the possible exception of typical local phrases that stand on their own (e.g., *Pack' mas?* for *let's go."")  
You'll never get it right, and it would seem fake. Imagine somebody from Boston attempting a Southern brawl. It's just silly.  
Exceptions apply when drunk and/or for comedic effect.

Then of course there are some local terms, especially food related, that are just practical to use if you know them. For example, take JFK's ""jelly donut"" example. Nobody there actually understood ""jelly donut"", because they're called *Pfannkuchen* in Berlin, which means *pan cake* elsewhere. In other parts of Germany they are indeed called *Berliner*, in yet others they're *Krapfen*. It helps to know those terms if you want to buy some in your local bakery.

However, Switzerland is a bit of an exception. AFAIK, some Germans living there adapt after a while, especially if they already know how to speak one of the related German [Alemannic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alemannic_German) dialects. This is partially because it's distinct enough to be seen as a language of its own, which makes it a matter of adjusting to the culture, and partially because Germans aren't exactly popular in Switzerland.

In short, you can do it if you actually can do it properly, but normally you just won't get it right anyway.
