It's always the same matter; where do you put the line? 

What if they are actually innocents? Of course there are lots of cases where we couldn't be more sure, but as long as you use it you'll have cases where you make mistakes.

Is it really beneficial globally? Criminals that are to be condemned to death have no reason not to kill to save their ass. And high-security prisoners don't escape normally.

Philosophically it's questionable. You take the right to decide to kill someone. Whatever they've done, you decide that have the right to decide of their death. Isn't that exactly what we reproach to them?

It ask the question of the aim of our justice system. Is it only to technically remove criminals from the streets (in which case why not kill all of them), or is it also to try to make them better persons?

Also, some people wants revenge on them and say that killing them is too easy. I don't think it's a valid argument but it's common.

true,RedZupp,null,null,"Das Problem des Sozialparadieses Deutschland betrifft nicht nur Migranten. Sie erscheinen nur prominenter als gleichhandelnde Deutsche. Frei nach dem Motto: ""Der Deutsche ist zwar ein Assi, aber der Migrant ein Parasit!"" wird dasselbe Problem unterschiedlich wahrgenommen. Man mokiert sich ja lieber über andere als erstmal vor der eigenen Haustür zu kehren. 
Natürlich gibt es Sozialempfänger-Dynastien, deutsche ebenso wie ausländische. Sowas ist nur in zweiter Instanz eine Frage Herkunft (Migranten sind überproportional vertreten, aber auch da gibt es komplexere Zusammenhänge) und vielmehr eine der inneren Einstellung. Für das Problem gäbe es Lösungen, die radikale Einschnitte in den Sozialetat und Arbeitsdienste beinhalten würden. Die sind in Deutschland zwar unausweichlich, aber im Moment mit Verweis auf den sozialen Frieden nicht durchsetzungsfähig. Hierbei handelt es sich jedoch um eine andere Baustelle.

Zurück zum Thema, wie soll man soll man diese Leute einfangen ohne sie an die äußerste Rechte zu verlieren? Ich möchte zwei Stoßrichtungen darstellen. 

Zunächst die Abkehr vom generell links-geprägten Medien-Mainstream in Deutschland. Auch vermeintlich rechte Themen müssen artikuliert und diskutiert werden können (Etwa von der Position wie sie Prof. Wolfsohn hin und wieder vertritt), ohne dass sie kollektiv niedergebrüllt werden. So erhalten die Betroffenen schon mal eine Stimme und bei weitem wichtiger, sie sind nicht gezwungen sich am rechten Rand zu positionieren, da sie eine Alternative haben ihre Meinung kundzutun. Die Gefahr einer NNP sehe ich eben in der Betonung des Nationalistischen. Hier wird dann auch an einem Rand gefischt, den man nicht unbedingt haben will. Die Öffnung der Medienlandschaft für solche Meinungen erlaubt denn auch etablierten Parteien wieder ihre Gewichtung vielleicht etwas mehr nach rechts zu verschieben und nicht direkt in Panik zu verfallen, wenn man eine etwas kontroverse Meinung vertritt. 

Eine NNP, die diesen Diskurs allerdings alleine bestimmen kann, könnte sich als Gefahr erweisen.

Weiterhin sehe zur Lösung des Urproblems die Notwendigkeit von umfassender, lebenslanger Bildung und Information. Fairerweise muss man sagen, das eigentlich jeder dazu in der Lage ist, sich diese zu verschaffen.  Man muss es nur einmal machen und da liegt auch die Krux. Hier kann nur Angebote gemacht werden, genutzt werden müssen sie von den Bürgern selbst.

Damit ich nicht falsch rüberkomme, ich würde eine Partei rechts der Union mit einer klaren Betonung liberaler Werte begrüßen, allerdings sollten Grundfesten wie das Bekenntnis zu Europa unangetastet bleiben.

The two ways to avoid corruption is either through social-moral pressure, generally having a culture that despises corrupt people, or through empowering the user, the customer, through choice and competition. 

This means that small, local capitalism works, through both means, and also local socialism works to some extent, in the sense that even if the village doctor is paid a fix sum by the state his respect and standing depends on how uncorrupt he is. Large-scale corporate capitalism works less, as decision-makers are often too far away for social-moral pressure and customer choice is limited. Large-scale state socialism also doesn't work because it has neither. The difference is, that Soviet-type socialism was more thorough in centralization than global-corporate capitalism, because they could for example just simply nationalize all doctors, while the global multis could not drive all local small businesses out of business, many, but not all.

you can always try out [Wanderfly](http://www.wanderfly.com), it's a pretty cool way to plan your trip, basically, you give a bunch of info like from where to where, budget, timespan and select the categories you're interested in, it then proceeds to search for things to do, where to stay and flights (via orbitz), aggregating reviews from yelp, foursquare etc...

as for which district to stay (arrondissement in french), it really depends what's your style, the 4th, 5th and 6th are usually quite touristy and you'll find a lot of affordable restaurants there, including lots of small museums to visit and a lot of shops. Given that those are pretty central you have access to pretty much everything by bus or metro within less than 20min.
7th, 8th and 16th are usually the most expansive of the bunch, but you can find something affordable if you look for it. Close to most museums, luxury shops and pricey restaurants, it's also calmer (8th is where the champs elysées are, crowed place obviously...)

1st, 2nd and 3rd are like the 4th and such a bit less ""young"", tho it's pretty much as close as you can get to the center =)

If you plan on walking/visiting and shopping a lot, i wouldn't recommend anything other than 1st to 6th district and maybe 9th and 10, other disctrict will be cheaper, but you'll rely heavily on buses and subway whereas being closer to the center will let you walk and wander around more freely.

I mean, with that kind of behavior they first blow up unsustainable financial bubbles, encouraging people and businesses to take on irresponsible loans - and then when the bubbles inevitably pop and the crisis breaks out, they deepen it exponentially by cutting the economy off from investment right when it needs it most (and potentially trigger a bank run in the process). 

That kind of behavior only makes sense from the most short-sighted perspective possible (loan lots of money out when you get loadsamoney coming in, demand it all back as soon as you get less) - but the task of banks in the first place was to spread risks and invest wisely to avoid such scenarios. That's what banks used to stand for, before they dived head over heels into the reckless financial betting game - an institution you could deposit your money to, or take a loan out from, and be sure that it would still have your money / still have your back ten years on when the economy might be doing worse. 

That would require the wisdom on the parts of banks to pursue an extent of countercyclical investment - save money during good times instead of issuing ever more unrealistic loans, so you still have some money to keep the economy going in bad times.

The most important thing are already mentioned in the thread. Health care is nice in Germany, but the UK (for instance) has a better system. Germany hasn't big university fees (you pay around 400€ each year for stuff like public transport and the materials you use in your studies (computer or stuff like that). If you want children, that would be a good point. Our educational system is bad as fuck but from what I heard, it's better than the US one (English is a must have class. You can't leave it.  Second foreign languages are very common when your child goes to a ""Gymnasium"" (highest high school). The students learn a lot about foreign countries and world wide (or at least European) history. French revolution is a big topic).

The conditions of your work are better. 30 days paid holiday and stuff. Already said as well. As an American, I don't think you mind if your pension is lower than it was 10 years ago. Because of the break of the DDR we've got a lot of old people who get pension but didn't pay for it. And now, we haven't enough money to pay the same pension as we did 10 years ago. But when you're that age, if could've changed.

But I would recommend you should live here for a few month and take a good look how stuffs works here in Germany. But in the end, it is no problem to live in another European country if you don't like it here. The only problem you'll have in the UK is that you need a bank account for a place and a place for a bank account =P

Do it.  Just do it.  You get to keep your US citizenship and even if you don't think you'll ever use the EU benefits, your kids might.  I wish my family had done this years ago, it would have made my life much easier now.  Also, if you're applying through your grandparents, you are the last generation that can apply.  Your kids can get citizenship through you, but they wouldn't be able to apply on their own.

Be prepared: the process is sometimes arduous, annoying, and time consuming.  Collecting the documents (depending on what you already have) can take a few months, even with fluent German.  From the date of application, approval can take between seven months and three years.  They will likely ask for more documents along the line, after you think you are done.  From approval to actually getting a passport can take a few months as well.

A lot of people here are referring to other laws and giving you misleading information (not on purpose, I know!  It's just that I know some of the information in other answers is not referring to this law).

I can answer lots of questions.

you are joking, right?
the german system (while by no means perfect, and inferior to the scandinavian systems) is lightyears ahead of the british nhs, the common joke around here in germany is that you can spot a british person by their ugly teeth. we have 50% more physicians per citizen and 100% more hospital beds per citizen ([source](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=health+germany+vs+britain&amp;asynchronous=false&amp;equal=Submit)). wait times are much shorter, our life expectancy is higher and our health care is cheaper for the normal citizen (we spend more per person, but employers have to pay a bigger share of it over here)

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"This is a very complex situation. There's the immediate need to prevent a catastrophe, and there are the long term effects any solution would have. 

There's also domestic German politics that play into this, so let's get this off the plate first. Skip to *[Part II]* below if you don't care to read all this.
 
As you probably know by now, the ruling coalition in Germany isn't doing all that well and is widely seen as dysfunctional. Here are the [latest polls](http://i.imgur.com/upjSg.jpg). The (neo-liberal) FDP, the junior partner of Merkel's conservative CDU, wouldn't even make it into the parliament with the 3% they're at now. The opposition rather vocally supports Eurobonds, but Merkel would have a hard time convincing her coalition to support them, and this coalition might even break apart under such stress. Normally, the conservatives could try to form a new coalition with the Social Democrats, but presently the opposition parties would make significant gains if new elections were held (likely resulting in a SPD/Green coalition, depending on how well the Pirates would do), so that's what they'd play for instead. You do not want to see a government crisis in Germany right now.

Two other relevant factors that are Germany-domestic play into this. One is the Weimar Hyperinflation, which still affects the collective psyche and economic thinking. That paying for government debt by printing money is bad is dogma. The other is that Germany went through its own crisis when we held the ""sick man of Europe"" title a decade ago, and austerity measures like the reform of the social net along with wage moderation are part of the reason why Germany is doing so relatively well right now, even though they were highly unpopular and eventually cost the SPD/Green government the reelection.  
What is ""asked"" of the GIIPS right now is of course on a different level, and at this extend even counterproductive in the present situation, but perception of how deep the cuts actually go are obviously skewed when looking at it from a distance through a lens of righteousness.

*[Part II]*

Against this backdrop and in the face of *immediate necessity*, Merkel doesn't have much room to maneuver. Of course, had she acted more decisively earlier on, we wouldn't be in this situation in the first place.

Several countries are in a tight spot right now, but the underlying reasons are really quite different. There are those with good or even exemplary government financials that got in trouble when housing prices collapsed because they had an overleveraged financial sector and/or have structural problems because they were too reliant on construction. They need space to breathe and time to figure out their problems. In others, governments acted irresponsibly, and they actually do need some austerity (and the pressure to make it politically feasible), although the extend to which this is happening right now might go too far. Those countries also have a problem with corruption and nepotism, and those are issues that can't be solved over night.

The latter are the reason why the potential moral hazard of Eurobonds or allowing the ECB to act as a lender of the last resort might have negative long term effects, both for their own economic development due to the lack of necessary reforms and in the form of permanent transfer payments. Without a mechanism to ensure reforms and long term fiscal responsibility, the fear is that we'd find ourselves in the same spot we're in now a couple of years down the line, but this time with a precedent of how avert collapse by simply handing over a checkbook.  
However, the immediate need to act along those lines is clear. Otherwise we'll all be fucked.

*[Part III]*

What I *think* Merkel *might* be trying to do is to use the collapse scenario to force the EU into a solution that is at least somewhat palatable for Germany domestically and would minimize the potential negative long-term effects. IMHO, this would be a tighter integration of the Eurozone in which members have to give up some sovereignty over their budgets in exchange for core countries (at least partially) underwriting their debt in the form of Eurobonds and/or an ECB funded bailout. This would cost the core in the form of permanent transfer payments and higher interest rates that go beyond the current EU structural funds, but in return there would be stability. Also, the core benefits rather handsomely from having a common currency, and could keep doing so.  
This is a scenario isn't really popular anywhere. The Eurozone core doesn't like to foot the bill, the periphery doesn't like austerity and the loss of full sovereignty over their budgets, and those outside the Eurozone don't like to see it push ahead with European integration. But for everybody it would be preferable to economic and political collapse.

Obviously this is a high-stakes gamble and the risk of failure is immense. However, you can imagine that negotiations over measures to ensure long term fiscal responsibility would go very differently without the immediate need to find a solution. I think it's obvious that we need a reform. The question is whether our politicians are able to for once be pragmatic and find a compromise that will work in the long term and is acceptable for everybody. We'll find out very soon. I have my doubts, but I'm certain that they wouldn't be able to agree on a solution when the pressure was gone.

The following line of reasoning is a bit fallacious because I'm putting the cart before the horse, but it does help with understanding the ratings. The USA, while downgraded to AA+ by S&amp;P, has an interest rate that reflects a AAA rating. In effect, investors are ignoring the rating agency and saying that there is no default risk. To some extent, that's the truest rating because these people are putting their money where their mouth is.

Meanwhile, the interest rates in many eurozone countries reflect relatively high possibilities for default, especially among PIIGS. A common-area eurobond would involve some of these countries guaranteeing the bond, which is little guarantee at all given the very real possibility that Italy and Greece especially might not be able to fulfill its financial commitments in the near future. Ratios are good and all, but the question at the end of the day is ""will I get paid?""

I think it is a valid method, given the inter-reliance of European economies; Similar to the subprime mortgage backed securities that ushered in the US crisis, the risk characteristic of higher-rated tranches are contingent on the lower-rated tranches, so the rating of the eurobond as a whole should rest on the guarantee with the highest possibility of default.",0,1322810207,null,0,true,0,c34kn6s,t3_mwl2u,t1_c34kn6s,t1_c34ga7a,1427961053,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,diespinnendoch,null,null,"* Auschwitz als moralische Rhetorik:

Die Antideutschen sind die selbsterklärten weissen Ritter der Verteidigung der Opfer des Holocaust (und deren Nachkommen). Stimmt man mit ihnen nicht überein, kann man nur ein Holocaustleugner oder doch zumindest -relativierer sein.
Du hast selbst weiter oben im Thread ein hervorragendes Beispiel geliefert:
&gt;Nach Auschwitz Deutsches nicht als Bedrohung für die Welt zu betrachten ist ekelhaft. 

Teilt man deine Einschätzung nicht, nach der ""Deutsches"" zwangsläufig zum Holocaust führen würde, so ist man halt ein Unmensch, nicht? Völlig ahistorisch wird die europäische Judenverfolgung deutsch gemacht, was ich genauso absurd finde wie diejenigen die glauben am deutschen Wesen könne die Welt genesen - nur eben umgekehrt.

* Kadavergehorsam:

Ich muss dir überhaupt nichts beweisen. Ich kenne genug Antideutsche die wirklich jede noch so unmenschliche Maßnahme, in der alle Palästinenser mit Terroristen in Sippenhaft genommen werden, rechtfertigen.  Wie steht es denn bei Dir mit dem Existenzrechts Palästinas? Nicht einmal der Besatzungsstatus wird meist als solcher akzeptiert, obwohl das sogar die UN tut. Selbiges gibt für die uneingeschränkte Solidarität mit der Politik der USA.

Nochwas zu Israel. Die Antideutschen macht es doch dauernd zu einem Judenstaat - als ob es eine Theokratie wäre und die knapp 20% muslimischen Israelis egal, von den Säkularen ganz zu schweigen.

* Antisemitismusunterstellung:

Nochmal, ich fühle mich nicht in der Beweispflicht, du kannst um Argumente bitten, beweise mir halt das Gegenteil. 

+1 für deine Unterscheidung zwischen strukturellen Antisemitismus und Antisemitismus. Nur: warum folgt daraus keine Konsequenz?  Occupy ist ein Sammelsurium von Positionen und hat eben keine klare politische Zielrichtung. Es vergeht kaum ein Tag an dem kein Jungle World-Artikel erscheint nach dem Duktus: make ALL  the occupies antisemitisch - und zwar nicht nur strukturell. Ein anderer Fall ist z.B. Ken Jebsen. Dieser Verschwörungstheoretiker ist möglicherweise bekloppt und bei ihm findet sich struktureller Antisemitismus, der aber weder Holocaustleugner noch Antisemit ist. Das ficht die Antideutschen aber nicht an und sie machen ihn dazu. 3. Beispiel: Der Palituch-tragende Pirat im Berliner Parlament, der eine völlig überzogene Tirade der Antideutschen ertragen musste. ""Frierst Du, oder hasst Du Juden?"" Ich sollte mir mal ein Palituch kaufen damit ich antworten kann: ""Ja, ich friere und du hast einen an der Waffel"". Es steht dir/euch frei nach gusto jeden als Antisemiten zu bezeichnen, ein allgemeines Definitionsrecht steht dir/euch nicht zu.

* Kritik: 

Richtig, deshalb aber bin ich kein Antideutscher, da das eine Bewegung ist, die *nur* in Angriffshaltung ist - ohne eine konstruktive Vision, wie denn z.B. der Nahost-Konflikt zu lösen sei. Die Hauptfeinde scheinen zudem deutsche Linke und sozialen Bewegungen zu sein und nicht etwa Neonazis. Oftmals hilft Aufklärung mehr als blindes Antisemitismusgetöse.

* Islamkritik: 

Natürlich muss der Islamismus kritisiert werden. Faschistoide Tendenzen gibt es in allen -aber auch allen- Kulturen und Religionen. Der andauernde Versuch des Nachweises bei Islamisten und oft genug am Islam selbst, ist einfach rassistisch. Schließlich heisst es auch nicht Christofaschismus.

[Vorsorglicher Antideutschen-Rethorik-Disclaimer: Der Holocaust hat stattgefunden und ist ein fürchterliches Verbrechen, Israel hat selbstverständlich Existenzrecht und muss/darf sich verteidigen, Amerika ist nicht der Hort des Bösen, bei den Linken gibt es Antisemitismus, Islamismus muss bekämpft werden, der von XenophobicAlien herbei halluzinierte Deutschenholocaust ist totaler Quatsch]",0,1322822470,null,0,false,0,c34ligk,t3_muzma,t1_c34ligk,t1_c34h3o6,1427961460,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

I couldn't find this quote in the article. Where did you get it from?
 
Katla and Lakagígar are connected in the sense that they're both part of the [the Iceland hotspot](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Volcanic_system_of_Iceland-Map-en.svg) which covers pretty much all of Iceland. Katla and Lakagígar do not belong to the same fissure system ([Lakagígar is north east of Katla](http://visindavefur.hi.is/myndir/katla_laki_170409.jpg)). Not that it matters since Lakagígar belongs to the same fissure system that [Grímsvötn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%ADmsv%C3%B6tn) (the single most active volcano in Iceland). Grímsvötn has erupted more than 30 times in the past 400 years the last eruption was last may. Lakagígar has erupted once.

My point is this. No one knows if Lakagígar will erupt again. Maybe it will maybe it won't. Maybe it will be tomorrow maybe in a thousand years. It's impossible to tell. It's not very responsible to jump to the conclusion that it's going to erupt because a volcano that erupts very frequently may or may not be about to erupt.
 
Edit:

&gt;If it erupts in a big way it wouldn't be an ELE or anything, but it could fuck over global harvests quite badly! It'd probably kill a bunch of Icelanders directly, too...

I don't think it would cause as much damage in Iceland as it did then. We didn't have the logistics in 1783 that we have now and we're not as dependent on local agriculture. A large part of the Icelandic diet today is based on imports. Fodder for chickens and pigs is mostly imported and grains for bread is also for the most part imported.

Otherwise those pupils won't change. If Germany doesn't press on and stops playing hardball, the troubled countries will not learn from their mistakes and probably wipe it under the carpet again as soon as the money faucet (here the ECB) starts running again. All they'll do then is promise to do better, but forget about it after the momentum is gone. Europe really needs some changes, and it truly is important with a single currency that no member can pull the others down with it. The rules need to be changed to reflect that. Now is the moment to make those rules.

Ofcourse Germany isn't completely altruistic in this, consolidating all debt in the Eurozone would be a *good thing* for those countries in trouble now, as the bad ones would be evened out by the good ones. One can imagine the biggest *good one* isn't exactly waiting for its AAA+ status to be degraded because it's now linked to other, worse rated countries. So by ensuring that only countries with a healthy debt ratio can partake in these Eurobonds, they can protect Germany's good rating, which it earned fair and square. 

I don't see why people seem to think that Germany has to give up their hard earned rating, only to sponsor countries that overspent. 
That would give the wrong signal. Each country should first clean up their mess (get a healthy debt ratio by austerity measures/budget cuts/...).

Whilst you're right it sounds like you're equating say, a volcano erupting and a coin toss. Volcanoes erupting aren't probabilistically independent events like coin tosses are; they're entirely related. 

You *can* reasonably claim that the longer an active volcano has gone without erupting the more likely it is to erupt tomorrow and the more likely it is to be a big eruption: magma and pressure does generally build up over time in a volcano and if it isn't released you can be pretty sure its going to go sometime. Ditto with earthquakes. If a tectonic plate as a whole has ground past another a few metres over a century or so but a part of the plate has been locked together then you can be *certain* that there will be an earthquake and pretty sure it'll be larger as a result.

true,Eichenschild,ASTR,Austria,"Firstly, you must realize, that there isn't one single European mindset. What people think about the EU depends strongly on the media of the respective country, their social status and their level of education.

In many ""northern"" Euro-countries (like Austria) the crisis isn't really noticeable in everydays life (yet). Many citizen of these countries feel like the EU want to make them pay for other people's mistakes. So the support for the german point of view is strong there. A rise of euro-sceptic parties (supporting, for example, a split-up of the Euro) is likely to happen there.

Especially the periphery thinks that the issuance of Eurobonds is the only solution. Obviously, big parts of the populace is opposed to austerity measures. They doesn't seem to think that they are responsible for the debt made by their governments. 

Non-Euro-countries, like the UK and Poland, fear both a collapse of the Eurozone and a too tight integration of the Euro-countries as it would mean that they would lose influence. 

I don't know what will happen, but there are some scenarios:

-) Germany give up its resistance. Eurobonds are issued, the ECB buys government debt, the market are flooded with money. The inflation rises, Euroland becomes a transfer union. The reforms get to a standstill because the pressure to tackle them diminish.

-) The periphery gets hit by more austerity. Their economies will shrink for some years at least. Depending on the loss of tax money caused by the recession, their debt will rise or fall. Eventually, their competitiveness will improve, but only if they aren't driven into default by market forces before the austerity measures deploy their positive long-term impact. Deflation is also likely to happen.

-) Worst-case: The countries can't agree on a resolute way to solve the crisis and keep muddling through it. The crisis would worsen and the Eurozone would get shattered. Dire economic consequences would lead to the destruction of approximately half of our wealth.

-) The most likely thing to happen is a combination of the first two scenarios. For example, Eurobonds will get issued, but the countries will have to surrender their fiscal sovereignty to the EU if they aren't able to keep their books in good order by themselves. There will be some kind of economic government, leading to even more integration and in the long run to the creation of an European superstate.",0,1322862594,null,0,false,0,c34qrpy,t3_mxw7f,t1_c34qrpy,t3_mxw7f,1427964006,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"I'll try my best to keep this short and simple, but I probably won't succeed. In the early 1990s, the European Union was established under its current name, and a monetary union was agreed to be created. This became known as the Eurozone, which was established in 1999. 17 of the 27 EU members use the Euro as a currency. The problem is that while monetary union was established, fiscal union was not. Thus, fiscal policy is still done at the national level, and not by the EU. Germany, Greece, Spain etc all have their own fiscal policy, which can affect the Euro currency. For the better part of a decade, the Greek government (both major parties, when they were in power), lied about their financial status to Eurostat, the EU's statistical office. Thus, it was only about a year or so ago that it became known that Greece was in much worse shape. Portugal, Ireland, and Spain are all in bad spots for different reasons, but the two most significant countries to worry about are Greece and Italy. Greece, first and foremost, because the yield on its governments bonds are above 30%, which is not payable. Thus, without money from other countries, the Greek government would default. Greek government debt is held largely by private entities, such as banks, that are spread out throughout Europe. This means that if Greece defaults, then German and French banks stand to lose a lot, spreading the crisis to countries that are relatively well off. Italy's main problem has been a severe lack of growth for the past decade. As such, the government has had to borrow more and more money in order to finance all its operations. As such, the yield on Italian bonds is hovering near 7%, which is considered unsustainable, and was the benchmark at which Portugal, Ireland, and Greece needed bailouts. Thus, Italy is worrisome because it is a huge economy, the third largest in the Eurozone, only a few hundred billion dollars/euros smaller than France. Because it is so much larger, European banks are even more exposed to Italian debt. Thus, the fear is that Italy will eventually need a bailout, which would cost many times more than the Greek bailouts.

The problem with bailouts is that they are temporary fixes. Governments need to get their finances in order, and austerity has thus become a major string attached to the various bailouts. The fundamental problem in the Eurozone is a lack of fiscal union. As long as government finances are done at the national level, rather than at the EU level, there is the opportunity for one bad apple to mess it up for the rest of the Eurozone. Gradually, people are warming up to the idea of fiscal union, which would mean surrendering a great deal of national sovereignty to Brussels. Keep in mind that this is still met with a lot of resistance, as nationalism still runs strong in Europe, especially among older generations. Because a common European identity is still not universally accepted in Europe, it is hard to explain to/convince the average German/Frenchman that fiscal union is in their best interest. Most politicians that come from the major centre-left and centre-right parties in Europe, fortunately, understand that greater fiscal integration is required. The problem is that this will be a very time consuming task. It will require extensive treaty changes, new treaties, national referendums, and approval from national legislatures. The EU functions as a confederacy, and as such, national issues often trump pan-European ones. This was the case in the national referendum on the ""EU Constitution"" in France and the Netherlands in mid 2000s. Both countries are largely pro-European, but their major parties found ways to bicker over the finer points of the treaty in order to score political points. Thus, everybody had a reason to hate it, ultimately causing it to fail, though it was reborn as the Lisbon Treaty is 2007. Thus, there are three relatively good short-term solutions to the crisis; solutions that would give Europe enough time to create a new treaty that erects fiscal union. They are:

1. Eurobonds

2. Letting the European Central Bank (ECB) act as a lender of last resort

3. Pool Eurozone countries' Special Drawing Rights from the IMF


Eurobonds are a proposed idea that would see all 17 members of the Eurozone issue jointly-backed bonds, rather than each country issuing their own bond. This would lower borrowing costs for countries such as Italy and Greece, though it would raise them for countries such as Finland and Germany. Resistance to this comes mostly from Germany and other well-off countries, as their borrowing rates would rise, and they also argue it would disincentivize the bad apples to reform and proceed with austerity measures.

Letting the ECB act as a lender of last resort would make the ECB a central bank like those of most countries. It could then be allowed to buy unlimited quantities of government bonds from Eurozone countries, giving Italy and Greece the money they need to operate. Resistance to this comes mostly from Germany, where they argue it would risk inflation, something that Germans know about all too well.

Special Drawing Rights are funds that countries can draw upon that they have invested into the IMF over the years. By pooling the money that each Eurozone country has invested in the IMF, a large sum of money can be used to bail out other countries without taxpayers having to foot the bill. The problem with this is that the sum may still be too small, and that many of those in well-off countries, like Germany, feel their money shouldn't be given away to the Greeks or Italians.

Number 2 appears to be the best option, followed closely by Number 1, and lastly Number 3. Germany will have to give on one of these three options in order to get the time necessary to create a new treaty. The most likely outcome will be expanding the powers of the ECB to act as a lender of last resort. It is generally accepted that a more integrated Europe will be the result of this crisis, paving the way toward more federalization toward Europe. This is perhaps the most important event in European history since the last World War, because it is likely that within a lifetime, the EU will become a sovereign state, similar to a United States of Europe.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Whether the cause was negligence, incompetence or plain bad luck,

It's neither of those. Euro was formed for political reasons and warnings from economists were ignored. There is such thing as [optimum currency area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimum_currency_area). Euroarea was formed with only one real benefit in mind (capital mobility). We don't fill other criteria expect capital mobility: 

1. no labor mobility across the region (language and cultural barriers), 
2. no real risk sharing system because EU countries lack solidarity needed for increased money transfers in hard times. Only answer can be austerity and punishment (direct opposites) and it just pushes countries like Spain deeper into abyss that was not it's own fault (I don't think Spaniards should tighten their belt just because their economy is not in sync with Germany).
3. dissimilar business cycles. This is why Spain is in so much trouble. Money from Germany flooded the country that did everything right increasing prices and wages. Now that money goes to another direction Spain is totally hosed. 

Trade between EU countries increased because of Euro, but negative aspects are stronger long term.  EU is in trouble because we have different economies that don't work in sync under the same currency. Britain was also in big trouble, but it can set it's house in order because it has own currency and own central bank. ECB monetary policy follows more or less the events in the biggest economy in the euroarea, Germany. If there is boom in Germany while Spain is in slowdown, ECB's tight monetary policy hurts  Spain. When there is boom in Spain and slowdown in Germany, ECB does nothing to tighten monetary policy and Spain has no tools to prevent overheating with money flowing from Germany. 

I would like anyone who thinks euro is good thing share ideas of how to resolve these negative effects with common fiscal and monetary policy.  ",0,1322865378,null,0,false,0,c34r7p0,t3_mxfk9,t1_c34r7p0,t1_c34qnoi,1427964215,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

That's already done, and for a long time now. But it's not really effective.

Personally I'm a little sad if English is to be considered as *the* official EU language. Not because I want it to be my language or another national language, but because it's not really fair or ideal. I guess that if one language is to be declared and used as the only one for international communication, English is the most realistic for now (although it's unrealistic to expect all Europeans to speak English fluently), but it's quite unfair. It means that (as it's already the case), native speakers will always have a huge advantage over the others, no matter the policy of other states or the personal implication in learning the language that individuals have. Also, the UK makes a huge economy on that (it was estimated at 17 billions per year).

All of these issues and scenarios were studied in a report from the university of Geneva called ""Grin report"". It's quite interesting but ironically it seems it wasn't translated from French. Basically it studies (and assess the cost) of 3 different scenarios: only English, a mix of 3 languages (french, german, english for the example), or only 1 non-national language (Esperanto in the example). If you speak French you can read the conclusions [here](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapport_Grin). Basically it says that the most effective for EU cohesion and the most cost effective would be the third option.

Of course one could easily say that one report could be biased, and that's true, but I wonder why we see so little studies and debate about the future language policy in the EU. It's a very important point, and it deserves a better answer than ""Americans dominate the world culture, therefore, English"".

&gt; Greek government debt is held largely by private entities, such as banks, that are spread out throughout Europe. This means that if Greek defaults, then German and French banks stand to lose a lot, spreading the crisis to countries that are relatively well off.

This is a common misconception, the last figures I've read about this were that German and French banks held only €9 and €10 billion of Greek government debt, respectively. That's lunch money, by this crisis' standards.  
The fear is that a Greek default might cascade through the financial system, by bringing interest rates in other European countries up, and by triggering credit default swaps. Nobody knows how many CDS' are floating around, they're not regulated. So, it's more about the indirect effects of a Greek default than about the direct ones.  
Also, they've got it down to those amounts by off-loading most of their Greek bonds to the ECB, which essentially means that the losses would get socialized among the Eurozone members.

Yes, even in the pouring rain we will put you outside on the balcony to have your smoke. 

Much the same for gay rights. I have gay friends - they know I am straight. If they would hit on me, while they know I am straight... that would be rude. And yes, we would say something about it. 

Being religious is almost the same. Of course you can go to a church, and everybody is OK with it. If you need some time for prayer before lunch, people will be silent for a moment - that is the respect you get. But if you thank God out loud for each small thing, people will think you are freaky and even call you out on it.

There is a big social security, but it is mostly based on the cultural notion: ""Werk naar Vermogen"" - meaning ""Work to Power"". So if you are in a wheelchair, there is some fitting work. If you are mentally challenged, there is some fitting work.

Other cultures may have little inclination to work. Dutch people are very reluctant to pay social security for people unwilling to work. This can be native Dutch, immigrants, but in the current circumstances, the Greek Italian and Spanish are considered unwilling to work as well. In that way, the dutch aren't very accepting of others. 

On the other hand, the Dutch are practical-conservative. This is most clear in the gender-defined jobs. Of course, there are some women in IT. Of course there are some male elementary school teachers. But in general, IT is a man's job - and teaching is done by women. Also healthcare is becoming more and more a female profession, where it was male-dominated a few decades ago.

Well, the point is that it's not the case. When you speak English, you have to try to imitate the British or US accent.

No, I don't think anyone can *reasonably* argue the other side--yeah, I ""understand"" their point of view, but I also ""understand"" the point of view of the right-wing Christian nutjobs who think abortion should be illegal. 

Of course pot, prostitution, abortions, and buying alcohol when you're 16 should be legal, is this really up for debate anymore?! I don't think so.

true,ambitiousbutrubbish,null,null," From Wikipedia: The Russian Federation comprises 83 federal subjects.[110] These subjects have equal representation—two delegates each—in the Federation Council.[111] However, they differ in the degree of autonomy they enjoy.

 I'm pretty oblivious to the actual state of modern day Russia, but what has amazed me while trying to learn a thing or two is how diverse it is. Out of the 83 sub-divisions there are 40+ oblasts (under different circumstances a single oblast/province could have been its own country) and there are so many ethnic groups and religions that Russia has to be extremely diverse. (21 republics: nominally autonomous; each has its own constitution, president or a similar post, and parliament. Republics are allowed to establish their own official language alongside Russian but are represented by the federal government in international affairs. Republics are meant to be home to specific ethnic minorities.)

 So i think this country is much , much different than the picture most of us westerners have in our heads. 

 When i think about all this it is indeed amazing this colossus is holding up. And this also justifies to an extent that the ruler of this country wants to be all-powerful. Like i said i'm far from being well versed on Russian matters, but i don't think the people are ready for the kind of democratic regime the west ""wants"".

true,[deleted],null,null,"Sure.  When I first started working here I didn't get paid for six months.  I should have been paid every other month (something that doesn't happen in the UK for a start, but is an oddity of the type of contract I'm signed on here, one of Berlusconi's creations to run down the universities).  My employer (a public university) kept putting off paying me.  As I was employed on money that the EU provided, I got my MEPs involved writing letters to the university.  This didn't work, so I finally threatened to quit, go back home and sue for constructive dismissal.  I was summoned into the head of department's office, where we had a shouting match that nearly came to blows.  His attitude was that I was making trouble.  Mine was that it was simply unacceptable that this situation had been allowed to go on for so long.  A couple of things about this incident:

  * First, this isn't an isolated incident.  PhD students here start work in February but the administration only gets around to paying them their first stipend payment in October.  Similarly, Italy has lots of problems with businesses providing services to public administration and then waiting absurdly long for payment.  I believe the technocrat government is currently trying to address that.  Finally, I'd point out that the idea that I'd be working in the UK, not getting paid, and this situation lasting more than a month, at the very most, before it got sorted out is unfathomable.  I imagine the same is true in Germany.  But it is tolerated here.  I've been told by my boss that the situation is so common that banks usually give people leeway to account for their employers not paying them on time.
  * Secondly, my Italian coworkers were absolutely amazed that my political representatives actually got involved at all, instead of ignoring the complaint.  The running joke for a few weeks after was whether I could arrange to get them to write to sort the air conditioning out in the lab.  Italians simply do not expect any sort of functioning government, or any sort of response from their political representatives.
  * My threat to take legal action was mostly hollow because the Italian legal system is dysfunctional.  I'd be 60 before anything got sorted out.  This is how the abuses become ingrained.  Contrast this with the UK where we have a ""sue happy"" culture, and I'd of been in a small claims court inside a month trying to get my money.

Similarly, there seems to be a lackadaisical approach to safety here.  Our sole fire escape in the department is bricked up, if you manage to unlock it.  This simply would not be tolerated here, nor I imagine in Germany.  Yet, this is significantly better than the situation in the mathematics department across the road, where a fire escape on the sixth floor opens up to an 80 foot drop, as the builders never put in the escape stairs on the other side.  Fire inspections sometimes close buildings down, but they open up a closed building from previous years, and wait a few years again to open the other.",0,1322931329,null,0,true,0,c34xfbx,t3_mxqfg,t1_c34xfbx,t1_c34x28y,1427967217,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5
true,TheVenetianMask,null,null,"It may not be emphasized enough on media, but the European crisis stems from corruption in politics and business. Things like the construction bubble in Spain were the symptoms, and while economic integration issues make things harder to solve, they aren't the cause itself. 

Obviously, a straight bailout would have made things worse. It's like paying a gambler's debts. Now, the great trouble IMHO is that many economic, political and public work networks in the troubled countries are built around that ""you rub my back and I rub yours"" relationships, and when the EU/the markets demand more competitiveness, institutional efficiency and fiscal reliability in order to release the needed funds, they are essentially challenging the existential nature of these parties, business people and syndicates. It's a ""culture crash"" as much as a financial crush. For an old political party, it is traumatic to have their choice of ranks imposed by external needs rather than internal ""aristrocracy"".
