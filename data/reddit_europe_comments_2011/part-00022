For domestic routes seat reservations are optional. In Germany, unlike France, more passengers are allowed on high speed trains then there is seat capacity. It will cost about 5 euros to guarantee a seat. If you are traveling during the summer or rush hour times and require a seat, it is best to pay the reservation fee In Germany it is possible to buy two types of bahncards, the bahncard 50 and the bahn card 25. These bahn cards reduce the rate of a normal price ticket by either 50 or 25 percent, bahncard 50 and 25 respectively. The bahncard 25 can be used to take an additional 25 percent of a sale ticket while a bahncard 50 has no effect on sale ticket's price.

(I'm myself both French and Canadian, and it's amazing how often it is assumed as a matter of course, when I explain that my father is Canadian, that he is from Quebec.)  Anyway, this means that it's not obvious to distinguish what the French think of Canada and what they think of Quebec.

Voltaire once described Canada as ""[quelques arpents de neige](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_few_acres_of_snow)"", and I guess the sentiment stuck.  I'm curious to see whether the Canadian federal elections will get any coverage in French media tomorrow or Tuesday (so far I've seen none).

The attachment of Quebec people to the French language is something most people find silly, I personnaly think it's really great and we should feel ashamed in comparison.

When you drop English words in a sentence and pronounce them with an American accent, it's troubling because we are used to people speaking English with a really thick/bad French accent.

According to [this](http://luxembourg.angloinfo.com/countries/luxembourg/work7.asp), workers in Luxembourg must receive at least 25 paid vacation days per year on top of their 10 bank/federal holidays, which equals 35 days in all (5 days less than France).

And the average working hours for someone living in Luxembourg is 1971, according [to the Study PDF download on the same website the author referenced](https://www.ubs.com/1/e/investors/releases.html?newsId=170250). So, let's calculate this out:

* Luxembourg's productivity is: $89,563.63/1791 = **$50.00/hr**

Last I checked, $50 &gt; $25.10, which is what France makes.

Other countries are higher too:

* Norway: $66,964.36/1771 = **$37.81/hr**
* Ireland: $52,892.89/1807 = **$29.27/hr**

I'm not sure what you're trying to say here. As another guy has said in your thread, consumption is the biggest portion of the GDP. Pensions or unemployment benefits aren't categories here. We're ONLY working with aggregates: Aggregate working hours (with the working force as base rather than the whole population, though, I think this might be your problem with this?) compared to aggregate production (whole population as base). I agree, it's fishy, but iirc the proportion of the working force in France is relatively small anyway.

On another note, I just remembered that if a State deficit is financed non-domestically (ie a Chinese guy rather than a French guy buys the French government bond), it should affect Import/Export and thus lower the GDP anyway.

Don't go to the catacombs after 4pm, it closes at 5 and you wont get in.

Dali museum was good and can catch the basilica nearby on the same trip.

Go to the eiffel tour after nightfall - less queues and a nice nighttime view too. Dont listen to those lads selling 5 keychains for a 1euro, you can get 6!

Correct.

&gt;purchasing a bond amounts to creating investment

Purchasing a bond is simply a redistribution of value, it doesn't create value in itself. If the issuer of the bond now goes on and buys something, then we have investment. I suppose that's what you mean.

&gt;can be done through leveraging assets.

You lost me here.

&gt;Pensions and unemployment benefits give people money to spend on consumption, while there is no accounted hours worked for it.

Pension money doesn't arise out of thin air. To get it, the government either taxed somebody or took a loan from someone. This someone now consumes and invests less. But look at it the other way round: If the unemployed guy buys himself food and concert tickets and pays his rent, someone had to create these values beforehand. Everything that is consumed and invested and ""fiscally expended"" in an economy, has been produced. Everything that has been produced, is used for consumption or investment or fiscal expenditures. It's an identity.

Pension money does come out of taxes, however like I said before there is a shortfall.

The identify you're referring to holds true in static analysis, given an infinite time horizon or even time series, as you can continue to move your liabilities into the future (by rolling bonds) while maintaining a level of confidence in you, thus giving you consumption money.

Now the reason I am arguing that the GDP numbers for France are not good at measuring the productivity is because of the large amount of pension spending and benefit spending, and there is also a deficit and accumulated national debt.

To give a sample example. We have a retired guy who is 65 and retired.
He is no longer productive to the economy as he does not work. Yes he did pay into his pension however he received a higher rate of return on it than he would have on his own. So he has this money which is paid for by the state issuing bonds that they will have to make interest payments in the future for. 

Now because he consumes, his contribution to productivity by the GDP method is infinite, as he works 0 hours and produces some positive value to GDP.

Same for unemployed.

&gt;7. (C) COMMENT:

&gt;XXXXXXXXXXXX's frustration with the Bulgarian government's lame and insincere reform efforts was striking. It appears to be spreading in Brussels where at least the working level appears to be feeling ""buyers remorse"" over letting Bulgaria and Romania into the club too early. According to reliable contacts, Brussels Eurocrats have dubbed enlargement fatigue the ""Bulgarian Break,"" further tarnishing Bulgaria's bad image within the EU (REFTEL A).

Internationale Analysten haben für den jetzigen Zustand der EU den Begriff  *""Enlargement Fatigue""* geprägt. 
Details here: 

[Enlargement Fatigue in the European Union: From Enlargement to Many Unions](http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/rielcano_eng/Content?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/elcano/elcano_in/zonas_in/europe/dt13-2009)

[Enlargement Fatigue in the European Union](http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.barnesrichardson.com/files/tbl_s47Details%255CFileUpload265%255C126%255Cforgue_fatigue.pdf&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=sie_TcSWNMOSswasw6iLBg&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAC&amp;sig2=vIEbmbKsQZbnHd4KKRFR8w&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPuYxPSKDhjO_CQWYRr_vTBzD9Lg)

&gt;Experience with the 2004 enlargement has shown that
several of these fears may be justified. For instance, the
UK has seen an inflow of roughly 600,000 workers from
Poland and other 2004 members. While the British gov-
ernment indicated that these migrants have mostly
helped “fill gaps” in Britain’ s labor market, this large of an
nflux in a relatively short period of time has led to some
concerns in Britain.

&gt;However, Britain’ s low unemployment rate (below five
percent) helps lessen the pressure from this influx. In France,
with over nine percent unemployment, and Germany , with
over 11 percent unemployment, the impact of 600,000 for-
eign workers entering the country would likely lead to a
much more significant backlash than it has in Britain.

&gt;The unexpected consequence of the migration of
workers from the 2004 members to the west has been a
serious lack of available workers in the Central European
countries. For instance, Lithuania has experienced a net
emigration of 400,000 people from the country of four
million people. This has led some of the Central Euro-
pean countries to turn to non-EU countries like Ukraine,
Russia, Moldova, and Belarus for laborers.


&gt;Similarly, some of the original EU members have
experienced a rise in criminality that appears to be based
n Central and Eastern Europe. Europol indicated that
countries like Austria, Germany, and France have major
organized crime groups drawn from the 2004 members.
Bulgaria and Romania have both struggled with corrup-
ion and organized crime and can be expected to contin-
ue to struggle with these issues. Insofar as Turkish
criminal gangs are already active in Germany  Austria, the
UK, and other EU nations, this concern among the EU
citizenry is likely to continue to contribute to resistance
to Turkey’s membership in the EU in the future.

I'm always happy to discuss with people who've heard the other side of the story! I'm in the process of fact-checking about the situation because the story we learned in school was very one-sided and lacking.

I know that the bi-communal state that was created with the [Zürich-London Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich_and_London_Agreement) was very dysfunctional. The inter-communal violence that ensued was very briefly talked about in my education, and so were the backgrounds of the attempted coup by EOKA B. We also know that the Zurich-London foresaw that the guarantor powers (the United Kingdom, Turkey, and Greece) could intervene in case one of the ethnic groups in the island was under threat, but Greek Cypriots generally see this as a preface used by Turkey to further its expansionary goals.

After witnessing the strong nationalistic element Greek Cypriots have to this day and after hearing some first accounts by Turkish Cypriots, I don't doubt that TCs were an oppressed minority during the time of the bi-communal state. Some people still like saying stories about a peaceful coexistence but I find them hard to believe after hearing stories about entire villages of TCs being murdered by Greek nationalist gangs.

However, there is no doubt that Turkey's invasion was a brutal war crime, which caused a lot of suffering to all Cypriots. Thousands had to flee from one one side to the other and hundreds of people are still missing. Then there are also human rights problems with some people who remained enclaved and there has been a lot of destruction of cultural heritage. Turkey's deliberate and continuous attempts to change the demographics in the occupied area make it clear that there were other motives behind the invasion, rather than just the protection of TCs.

As for Famagusta, I have no doubts that the reason it became a ghost town is the economic isolation of the Turkish occupied area.

That's why I deleted it, and posted this.

I was about to send you a message to explain my stance. :) 

I wanted to reply with this immediately. I'll edit and weigh in (granted I have something to say) after I read the rest of your message.

**Edit:** I read your message, here are my two cents.

If we must blame an entity, that article suggests that entity should be the United Kingdom and/or Grivas, and the Turkish Cypriots for responding in kind.

Turkey is guilty of trying to force it's conterpart's hands, from what I can see, it did not allow for enough consultation time twice during this encounter. It is perhaps wrong to press for contingent territory for TCs, it is definitely wrong in occupying such a large portion of the land and expecting it to be a TC state. It is wrong to hope that securing the Turkish-Cypriot enclaves in a ""net"" rather than precisely liberating them would lead to the international community ceding the land to TCs. I also cannot see the logic behind TCs and thus Turkey pushing for exclusive seperation. (100% Turkish vs. 100% Greek)

I cannot pass judgment on whether or not TCs were wrong to declare unilateral autonomy. Note, they did that without support from Turkey, and Turkey's decision to support it was the most logical move for Turkey at the time. Also, the only one that correctly rewarded the solidarity the TCs expressed with Turkey, and one that didn't betray the trust they placed in Turkey to escape prosecution.

I cannot know how Greek-Cypriot national identity was back then. I assume they viewed themselves more Hellenic than Cypriot. I'm reasonably sure this does not continue today. But Greek Cypriots were wrong to seek enosis without the TC blessing, or at the worst without allaying TC fears.

The then-head of UN is at fault for forcing Turkey's hand, even though his move was warranted. The resolution, in my opinion, does not accurately depict Turkey's presence on the island. Not then, and not now. 

As far as ""expansionism"" goes, I do not see what use Turkey would have of a military base in Cyprus, when it can project its hard power on the surrounding nations just as easily from it's mainland (as demonstrated in the Cyprus dispute).

**Regardless, these are matters of the past. Since the political and social dynamics of Greek Cypriots are significantly different much like the Turkish Cypriot social dynamics, it is wrong to continue talks on the same pretext and play the blame game.**

Turkish Cypriots obviously do not want Turkey with them anymore, much like how Greek Cypriots are content with Cyprus being a state rather than Hellenic territory. Turkish ""occupation"" will end the minute the local government tells them to go. As such, it's not much of an ""occupation"" when the minute the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots reconcile, they will voluntarily withdraw. Thus, it is wrong to treat it as a fundamental problem.

If one doubts that Turkey will leave the minute TCs give the word, they should realize that Turkey wants to enter the EU much more than it wants the welfare of TCs, at least that is the present situation.

But it will be expected to subsidize the development of the north Cyprus - since it will be indirectly responsible for the sanctions, if it leaves as an invading power. It might not have a problem with it, but this has to be pronounced for it to happen. 

For that, Europe has to stop viewing North Cyprus and Turkey as a single entity. That is the only thing that will break the deadlock ideally, that will lead to a solution, imo.

Thanks for writing back. :)

Turkey can withdraw it's troops from the island. What then? The local Turkish Cypriot population elects that government that only we call TRNC.

It's rather the world who needs to realize that that political entity in the north is not just an ""occupation"". They are self governing people, and if Turkey withdraws, they will not yield.

I assure you, they will take up arms again (like they did with the TMT) if a solution they are comfortable with is not reached. 

At which point, without Turkey's support, the world will starve them, or beat the ones who take up arms, into a deal. Such a deal has no hope of being just, and thus has no hope of surviving.

North Cyprus is more of a nuisance and an unwanted responsibility for Turkey, than a bargaining chip. It would love to leave the island and cut all ties to the matter, believe me.

Please note, I'm not a proponent for Turkish accession. The most positive deed the EU can do Turkey, in my opinion, is transforming it into a fully functional European democracy, which is what it's already doing.

I do however believe it is somewhat odd to block out Turkey given it complies with the above. A Turkey in such a state cannot possibly be harmful to the dynamics and politics of the EU.

As for the settlers, here's what I have **heard** and **deduced**:

- This was being done to increase the Turkish population of the north, to provide justification for keeping the present percentage of the island under a federal or two state solution.
- There are north Cypriot laws for such Turks to gain residency or citizenship in Cyprus. (Side story: and there is a purposeful lack of such laws in Turkey. Turkey does not welcome Turkish Cypriots permanently - my mother had to marry my father for citizenship. Before they got a divorce though they fell in love and had me, and had a second ""wedding"" even though they were already legally married. :P)
- AFAIK the futility of this policy was realized, and it does not actively go on at the moment. However, the laws still exist, and as such the odd family looking to relocate to north Cyprus can do so.
- One overly optimistic hope was to increase the Turkish Cypriot population (from the 18% it was and is), by way of cross breeding between mainland Turks and Cypriots, thereby increasing the local Turkish Cypriot population.
- The above was never realized since there isn't much love or respect for the ""settlers"" from the Turkish Cypriot people.
- They are referred to with a slur, ""karasakal"" (translit: darkbeard) which translated corresponds to ""caveman"" in English. This is due to many of the settlers being from the impoverished and uneducated southeast of Turkey.
- Turkey used to offer meagre amounts of money to families willing to relocate. I do not know if this still goes on.

true,[deleted],null,null,"You can call it anything you want, and I suppose you're right about ""assassination"" if you define it as setting yourself as a goal to systematically kill someone in the field - but I'd personally make a distinction between going after someone who has advocated, planned, and led acts of war against your country and someone whom you just don't like (let's say someone like Hugo Chavez).

When I say ""acts of war"" - that's kind of a weird way of putting it, I know, but at the risk of going off on a tangent, I find the concept of ""war against Al Qaeda and similar organizations"" a lot less nonsensical than ""war on terror"" (how _do_ you fight a war against a tactic, Mr. Bush?)  

So in that sense, I see sending a hit team after OBL as no different than, say, sending commandos to blow up a German general in WWII.  I don't have a problem with that as long as you didn't start it.  Even if you give any credibility to the idea that OBL had nothing to do with 9/11 (I don't), there's still the African embassy bombings, the USS Cole attack, the WTC bombing, and any number of other planned and executed acts of violence against American and allied targets, military and civilian, that I'd classify as ""acts of war"" - in addition to the continued active incitement to violence.

That said, I personally believe that there's a distinction to be made on two levels - first of all, whether you consider yourself to be at war with someone or not, as described above, and second of all, whether you have the practical opportunity to capture and try your target (because war or not, you're also talking about criminal acts against civilians).  So, even if the idea of assassinating someone is legit IF (big if) they make themselves a target through acts of war, killing a prisoner in cold blood would be not OK at all.  A good example of this would be the assassination of Che Guevara.

So yeah, you're right about assassination.  But I would qualify that by saying that in my view, targeting bin Laden for assassination was legitimate, and unless he was killed in cold blood after surrendering or there was a practical opportunity to capture and try him, the way in which he was likely killed was legitimate.

The Greek Cypriots have to show that they are actually willing to peacefully coexist with a Turkish minority in order for Turkey to even consider loosening its grip.

I still do not see how you define ""European"". I still do not see what ""the past"" has to do with the accession of an economic socio-political entity entering an economic socio-political union.

Still, when the past is concerned:

I'm assuming you use both a geographical AND a cultural criteria, otherwise you would object to Cypriot accession, and that is why Canada and Japan aren't eligible of accession (not to mention Japanese culture is not at all European).

On the other hand, genetically and culturally, the 2 million Turks that got to Anatolia got assimilated completely on the ethnic front. Culturally, they managed to impose their new found culture, the blend that resulted of Byzantine Anatolian and Central Asian Turkic cultures on their territories for centuries, yes. But as I pointed out, that culture is nowhere near the same today. If you compare Central Asian Turkic cultures, to the culture of Turkey today, the Turks are more European than they are Turkic. 

Religiously, yes they are 86% Muslim, but half of that 86% do not practice their religion, if religion mattered at all. For all religious purposes our religion is Secular.

If these factors mattered at all, it means the EU agreed with me, since Turkey is a candidate member.

Not that it matters, but just as easily you can denounce European Turkey as half assed, you can do the opposite. It is bigger than whole European countries (WOAH), it's home to the biggest European city, and the second biggest city in the world (WOW), it's population is again bigger than the population of some whole European countries (OOOH).

I do not think the Union agrees with you on what constitutes European identity. They seem to define themselves more on social terms rather than cultural, it is ludicrous to expect the whole of Europe to assimilate into a single European culture. 

They also seem to agree that if Turkey becomes European by their definition, what happened before is a bitter mistake of the past sure to not be repeated. When that assurance is there, why it matters is a mystery to me.

The second the violent suspect either opens fires, or there's a more than reasonable suspicion that he will (ie: he draws his gun). That's not what we're arguing here though; if the orders of the Navy Seals had been to **apprehend** him, but then had to kill him in a firefight, I wouldn't have objected at all (although some people are raising an interesting question: whether a couple dozen of fully armed and fully protected Navy Seals couldn't, with a reasonably low risk to themselves, have apprehended him alive, even in the case he opened fire.

Your objections that follow do not have anything to do with an European identity, I would like to point out. 

I have not advocated Turkey's immediate, unconditional accession to ""The Union"", yet you continue to judge Turkey in it's present condition and offer that as justification for why Turkey does not fit. 

I do not know if you realize, all of the conditions the commission has set for Turkey's accession are aimed at increasing the compatibility of Turkey with Europe, and improving Turkish quality of life to the point where there won't be a significant rift between the two nations.

There are entire organizations funded by the EU that explicitly list this as their objective. Cooperation projects, NGOs, etc.

If and when that rift is bridged, I doubt the Turkish people will immigrate to Europe for shits and giggles, and start gangs when they have sustainable lives and job security in a liberal, democratic Turkey.

If you believe Turkey will access the EU in a condition any less than that, please reconsider. If it does, it will with heavy freedom of movement restrictions imposed on it. Maybe it will even have a heavy cap on the number of MEPs it can have.

But to think that a self-sufficient, developed, democratic Turkey would be harmful to Europe is nothing more than prejudice in my opinion.

I also like the system that we have in Austria that allows us to vote for a list and gives us an additional vote to modify the list (on a regional and a voting district level). This has the nice property of resulting in a constant number of seats. Unfortunately, the minimum number of votes required to effect a change in a candidate's ranking is too high, so it happens at most for one or two candidates per election.

Yep. The whole election was deemed unconstitutional, and somehow the judges failed to set a reasonably early date for re-elections. That non withstanding it's approaching (about a year left) and politicians still didn't come up with a solution. It *is* possible to fix the system and still have a cap on the total size of parliament [1], but the CDU is royally incapable of agreeing to any of the solutions, so parliament size is going to explode, again.

Greens and the SSW are the only sane parties currently in parliament.

With PR-STV, this pointless risk is eliminated in that you can just run two candidates in the hopes that both will get in, but worse case scenario, the transfers will get at least one candidate through.

Also, voting in PR-STV, I always like to vote for my favourite candidate, even if they're a total underdog and give my second preference to my preferred viable candidate. If we had SNTV over here, I would be robbed of that luxury and would be forced to vote for one of the viable candidates instead. You may ask me what's the point in voting for an underdog? The answer is, under PR-STV, there's no risk and every once in a while, when enough people do the same thing as I do, the underdog becomes a viable candidate, which would have been impossible under SNTV.

Lastly, PR-STV is the most democratic system, because it combines the advantages of AV and SNTV (as in SNTV's multi-seat constituencies which AV does not have) but ultimately, First Past the Post is a joke and barely worthy of being called Democratic.

true,kskxt,null,null,"**In terms of representation**, [Denmark's system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Denmark) is fairly good. It's as representational as can be, and politicians can call a public vote in issues deemed important. At the same time, it is not a direct democracy, so uneducated people aren't involved in the fiscal policies of the government - just look where that got California. Votes aren't weighed for weird reasons like Norwegians recently learned where, I believe, the votes in Oslo did not count as much as those outside (or the other way around, which may have tilted the scale in the opposition's favour instead of the incumbents. And we all know how the [UK system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtbfG_eKlZg&amp;feature=related) is ...

The same system applies to local elections - I *believe* - but I have absolutely no idea how that's working out. It doesn't attract the brightest people for the following reasons.

The **problem** with the system is that it's completely anti-technocratic; it's similar to the UK in how the parliament is comprised of people who've brown-nosed their way up the ranks of the party, often after decades of involvement. This means rather unqualified politicians and no chances of people showing up from the sidelines like you would see in the U.S. The politicians rarely have great credentials in terms of education (the educational system in Denmark is not exactly like that of the UK and US) or experience in private enterprises.

Not being a two-party system, Danish politics is more about party than candidates. The grandiose and bombastic rhetoric wouldn't fly in Denmark anyway, so it wouldn't fly regardlessly.

The low prestige of political life and the somewhat boring private enterprises of Denmark together with the insane footwork leading up to your candidacy means that there is little incentive, if any, to enter politics. Recently, we've seen some cases where it has become evident that people in government are doing everything just to stay in power - even if it means ruining the economy, culture, education, and infrastructure. And this isn't even being cynical. Granted, a lot of governments ruin the economy, but I hate the reason the government in this country does it. (Note that a prime minister has no term limits.)

I believe Denmark has the lowest corruption is the world, which is also largely attributable to the fact that there aren't any lobbies nor big corporations who see huge opportunities in the Danish industry.

I don't believe there is a supreme court to challenge the laws of government either. Then again, few nations are as focused on their constitution as the U.S.",0,1304471440,null,0,true,0,c1sb6cw,t3_h3b5g,t1_c1sb6cw,t3_h3b5g,1427116928,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

But in their defense, they did have laws about making men bring swords to political meetings.)

Also, historically the country has been ethnically and culturally pretty homogenous, even if the French and Italian Swiss think the German Swiss are all white sock wearing fascists, the German and Italian Swiss think the French Swiss are all obnoxious homosexuals, the French and German Swiss all think the Italians are lazy communists, and the Romands, well, we all think they make goat sacrifices up on their mountain.

The military's becoming increasingly irrelevant as mass armies have lost their purpose, and politics is becoming professionalized on the national level, which is unfortunate.  

Also, economically the country has a _lot_ of small business; combined with low taxes and a historical anarchic streak, this means that people are really loth to let anyone else spend money.  There are also a lot of checks and balances, both soft and hard - i.e. the federal council (the executive branch) gets to put out its own voting recommendations even with a popular initiative.  Laws are codified pretty simply and straightforward; any reasonably intelligent person has full access to both civil and criminal law (they are sold in little reference books) and can understand these pretty well.

The country is also very very small, which is a huge benefit.  This is why I don't want it joining the EU - even something that happens ""on the other side of the country"" can have a direct impact on Joe Voter - because it's, what, 4 hours away by train?  Tops?

There is a difference between finding your political ideology wrong and scary, and disagreeing with you about how you would vote (and yes, I know exactly what you're thinking, I'll get to that below).

The voting public is a scary thing, and requires vigilance and strong institutions to keep abuses in check - just like, oh, I dunno, strong politicians who are handed responsibility.  The difference is that in a strong democracy, ""the voting public"" is a wildly differentiated thing, even in places like California, where ""mob rule"" is often held up as a bad example of too much democracy.  Even in CA, with its comparatively weak institutions and vigilance, people start realizing that something is deeply flawed in decisions they themselves have made, and begin to understand that they must do something about it.

So unlike in an enlightened despotism, which is basically what a system is in which you vest decision-making authority in a group of ""experts"", in a highly democratic system there is always recourse - through institutions, and through other voters.

Now you're probably going to say that which decision is good or bad is an opinion. At least that's what I get out of the implication you concluded. I disagree with that notion. Correct me if I got that wrong. Anyway, that assumes that all opinions are equally valid, which they are not. Some decisions are (objectively) better than others.

Yes, and I stand by that.  No, not all opinions are adequately valid, but I trust voters to generally sort out which are and which aren't.  You may disagree with certain ones (I am not going to go into voting results about mosques and things because that'll probably end up in a fight about an irrelevant issue) but you obviously disagree with a certain specific result.  That's fine.  But it was voted on and (so far) found to be legitimate within the contextual controls set for the democratic process; you don't have to like it.

&gt; You claimed your voters tended to be informed and engaged. I gave two examples where that assessment might be doubted.

They were context-free and irrelevant, I regret to say.  One concerned a vote whose outcome you and many others personally disagree with - that does not make it wrong or the people who voted for it ""uninformed and not engaged"".  I find this to be a frequent, and highly condescending and presumptuous attitude that's frequently expressed about electoral outcomes.

The second is irrelevant insofar as it concerns a phenomenon that had not yet evolved at the time to the same level as the state of that particular issue (women's rights) in other states.  Not all countries evolve at the same rate - but you'll note that universal suffrage _was_ introduced.

The slowness of our forefathers in no way reduces the legitimacy of the process and it is IMHO pretty lame to bring it up.  I find it analogous to bringing U.S. slavery into a discussion about the socioeconomic systems of the present-day American South, Nazis into a discussion about German politics, or what-have-you.  Failing to give women the vote in as timely a manner as you or I would have liked was a result of shameful foot-dragging, not a broken system.

 The parliament of 500. 50 representatives from each of the 10 tribes of Athens were elected and prepared the material to be discussed in the citizen meetings, whose proceedings they were overseeing. Members had to be over 30 y.o.

 The 9 archontes (rulers). They were the then-equivalent of government ministers with mostly court/legislative powers. They were generally appointed through lottery to ensure fairness, except the positions that required serious expertise (army minister, etc) which had handpicked appointees. Rulers were checked both before and after their terms for competence and fairness. They could only serve one term. Former rulers could join the Areos Pagos.

 The Areos Pagos was the central court of sorts (Modern high court goes by the same name). Its members had lifelong membership and over the years its power varied. From all powerful to just a court, would be a simple analogy.

 The Ilyea public court. With a membership of 6.000 people it was the court for the masses. Citizens had the right to bring up cases and even report state officials thought to be corrupt/etc.

&gt; You didn't get a say on Lisbon in the same way that you don't get a say on your tax, criminal or libel laws; 

The party in government at the time promised a referendum on the EU Constitution. While the treaty is not the failed Constitution, it contains much of the same content. So, really, we should have had a say. But there was no chance of that - wouldn't want another France or Netherlands style smackdown. I suppose the EU could have conceded a few token gestures to secure the vote they wanted the second time, as seemed to happen in Ireland.

The government, which is the institution that is generally tasked with ratifying international agreements, has access to advice on the actual legal ramifications of the Treaty from the Attorney General.

By the way, reading the Treaty and understanding it are two very different things. You can read Lisbon without understanding it (and, if you read it without also reading the other Treaties, you *won't* understand it). On the other hand, if instead of reading it you obtain advice on or even a summary of the Treaty from someone who does know about it, you would have a better understanding.

&gt; Are you suggesting that the people shouldn't get a say on things they might not understand (which sounds a little patronising)?

What is the point in people voting for things they don't understand? What benefits does that bring, and how is it more protective of people's rights? It doesn't result in people getting the results they want. An essential part of making a decision is being able to understand the subject matter and likely effect of your decision.

true,vrrrrrr,EART,Earth,"Once in the Euro, there are two choices: either the ECB inflates to keep up with the most profligate of spenders (causing a race of deficit and inflation), or it reins in monetary policy, effectively bankrupting the same governments. Outside the Euro, the same governments could have inflated on their own. Ideally, you'd want balanced budgets and low debts, that's what the Stability Pact was supposed to do. But in the rush to join the Euro, everybody forgot to rein in spending.

Keeping a tight budget should still be an objective, even after the current inflationary spike. Plainly, the political leaders of Europe have lied to their people that it's possible to spend without having the resources to cover it. Deferring via borrowing has all the bad consequences beyond the political mandate, but brings benefits right away.

Perhaps the best thing in the mid term is just to reevaluate the debts and default on some of them. This has the added advantage that states will find it harder to take on debt in the future. Of course, it's going to be slightly worse over the short term, but otherwise it gets much worse in the future. These debts simply can't be repaid.

What will happen is the charade will be maintained for as long as possible, then we'll learn about the defaults at the very last minute. We only learned about the bailouts over a week-end, after months of denial.
