true,Britzer,null,null,"I used to buy my bread only in a bakery. There is a discount self service bakery where I live. There they have grey bread with a black and very hard crust and soft inside. Bread was about €1,80 there for a 0,75 kg loaf. They bake bread out of prepared loafs that come from their central bakery all through the day. So the bread is only a couple hours old. Fresh bread tastes the best. And maybe the next day. After that the bread doesn't taste as good anymore. 

Shelf life is very difficult to measure, because if handled correctly it is virtually indefinately. Sailors used to take dried bread on their voyages at sea. As long as it doesn't mold, it is good to eat. It is mostly about taste.

My wife has had a dental braces put in place a year ago. So for the last year we have been eating softer bread from the super market. They also have the same kind of grey bread that a bakery carries, but they put it in plastic bags and the crust is soft. Also it doesn't taste as good to me. But I like the stuff we are buying. It is called sunflower seed bread for obvious reasons. It is very dark brown, almost Pumpernickel and has a lot of unbroken seeds. When kept in the plastic bag it comes in, it has a printed on shelf life of four or five days. At 0,5 kg a bag it costs less than €1. I eat that in the morning and evening. Since I have a lactose problem I replace butter with [margerine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarine). I always put margerine below and a topping, such as [Kräuterquark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarine) (Quark mixed with fresh spices), ham, salami, fish, or anything else on top. There are whole sections at the supermarket devoted to toppings in Germany. Mostly all kinds of cheese and meat products. But also jam and Nutella. When I think about it, it is similar to how the Arabs eat their [hummus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummus). They tear off part of their bread and dip it in hummus. We Germans just put the bread down, put the stuff on top with a butter knife and then eat the whole slice of bread. But the end product: Bread with a topping ends up being the same. I mention this, because I frequently buy hummus at out local Arab food store to use as a topping.

This is the largest name brand franchise bakery chain in Germany:

Though there you would pay something between €2 and €4 for a loaf of bread. Lots of people buy [Brötchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_roll) (english article somewhat misleading again), in the morning. The very white version of them are also known as Semmeln or Weckerl in Southern Germany and Austria, Schrippen in Berlin and Rundstücke in and around Hamburg. But Brötchen can also be dark.

true,Britzer,null,null,"I find the German bachelor (and bachelorette) party traditions from southern Germany stupid. I live in Berlin and we have seen a huge influx of that in the last ten years or so. I don't even know if this tradition has any roots beyond 20 or 30 years. Basically what they do is wear the same embarrassing outfits. Often times just a t-shirt printed for the occasion. While dressing somewhat similar the groom or bride to be is dressed especially different. The groom would be dressed in drag or something. And then they would have games where the groom would need to talk to girls and get them to do something. Often times just signing the shirt.

Please, please, please DON'T do this. 

Have a nice party. A nice occasion. Something memorable. Climbing up something sounds nice, if it's what you like to do. I am not much into drinking. Are you and your friends into that? 

Maybe I am completely devoid of humor, but I always felt like the stripclub or stripper (and to a large extent the forced talking to girls) is some kind of prude attempt to the 'last time you are free to fuck around', where real intercourse is not allowed anymore, because you already have a relationship. 

But this is just me. It all depends on what kind of people you are and what you enjoy. If you can have a really good time in a stripclub, then by all means go for it. Just don't do anything because some five year old tradition forces you to do something.

My parents generation Polterabend was a party with friends before the wedding, because the wedding itself is with relatives, not with friends and during the day. So they invited all their mutual friends, neighbors and closest relatives for the Polterabend and were doing that together as future bride and groom and then had the extended family for the wedding. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polterabend

Just do something you believe the groom will like and if you really want to make it memorable, put a lot of thought into it. What would be the perfect party? Some people like amusement parks for example. Well, we have some amusement parks that are still open and during weekdays in bad weather don't have *any* lines. Perfect for a fun ride freak.

Let me paint the scene. We have a boulevard that is near the railway station. There is a cinema and lots of restaurants. So it's pretty crowded on weekends. I go there once a month to do some bowling. Afterwards we grab some dinner. And during the summer I swear to god, there will always be 2, 3 parties like this going on.  
  
You sit in the outside area of the restaurant because the weather is nice and you have two or three of these crowds approach you at your table while you are eating. Oh, and most of the time, they don't just want you to sign their shirt or something, they bring along a basket full of ""Kurze"". i.e little bottles of booze and you are supposed to buy them from them for a buck!  
  
The last time I had that happen, I sat inside a Pizza Hut. Two floors. I was on the top floor. They actually went inside and even up the stairs to walk from table to table. I was pissed. Which apparently they could see because as they approached my table one these guys just said ""we should better move on. i can see that this will not be fruitful, here""  
  
Oh, and one more thing happened at the same Pizza Hut, but on a different occasion. Another one of these parties comes in. Completely shitfaced. They ""detonated"" some kind of pepperspray bomb! Inside the restaurant! People had to leave it was so bad. The staff opened all the windows but it still took some time before you could breathe in there normally. I tell ya, I kind of wish I gotten my hands on these fucks.  
  

I generally cannot understand what drives people to public stunts like these. But I for one will never do this and there fore, I will never participate in these things, neither.  
  
To give a general idea how much grief this ""tradition"" gives me. When I started to be confronted with this, I was still just embarrassed and resorted to the ""look down and act like you are looking for something or faking a cell phone conversation."" Just so they wouldn't try to pull me into this nonsense. So, they caused me angst and discomfort. But since went on for so long, I finally decided that there is nothing these people could do to me that would warrant me being afraid of them. So now, I am just pissed because they interrupt my dinner while thinking its the most hilarious thing in the world.

Edit

Ok! So, your set up is similar to a few friends of mine; living separate from the family. Your pay is fairly average for an au pair, it is doable to live on, but you obviously can't be extravagant. They should also be paying for your groceries as well, so make sure they do! Keep your receipts and give them to them, or negotiate a food budget with them. The point  is that they basically pay for everything for you, and give you a small amount of pay that would be more or less equal to what you would have left over after paying any normal bills and rent.  
When I arrived, I spoke a tiny bit of French. Like, pretty much nothing, and I got by. The kids spoke basically no English, so it made things kind of tricky. If you have a smart phone, make sure you have a dictionary/translator on there, or otherwise keep a French/English dictionary on you. When I left, the kids were both top in their class in English, and I can hold a fairly extensive conversation in French. Are you going to school for French? Most visas require you to. 

If you're only working in the afternoons, you can certainly pick up another job. There are a bunch of companies that you can write to about teaching English to kids, or you can look at tour guiding and such. Paris is pretty expensive, but if you budget carefully, then you should be able to get by.

Hopefully this all makes sense, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to ask!
