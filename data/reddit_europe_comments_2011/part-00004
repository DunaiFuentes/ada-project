Regarding Europe, i find this especially funny. Maybe EU citizens don't need guns, since they can defend their interests trough the proper political process, and if that doesn't work, trough public protests?

It's your identity, do whatever you want with your national mythology. I don't need information as to why so many Americans have a fetish for weapons. I understand what a gun is for. Guns and need for protection are the same here, and all over the world. I don't go around the internet telling Chinese people how awesome paper, porcelain and gun powder is, and how we use it and their evil politicians forbid it.

&gt;America was born with free speech and protest, **so while we treasure it, we don't have the same values behind as many European states where historically freedom of speech and protest was not allowed**, that's why you more than likely treasure it more than we do in a relative way, though we still value it.

However, you must realize Flanders is generally richer than Wallonia and has a better job market. Although this has been changing lately (or so I've read in the newspapers) Wallonia still needs Flanders to be able to pay the bills of the social security, etc.

Obviously Wallonia is strongly against such reforms, as they would endanger the economic stability of the country. Also note that a very large part of Wallonians work for the government. This means they weren't struck as bad as Flanders by the financial crisis, and therefore not as motivated to engage in economic reforms.

The Wallonian party that received the most votes is a very socialistic party that nurtures the social security like a baby child, and hisses at every attempt the Flemish have made so far to try and change it.

Well, being an American I am obviously more familiar with American history than European, so I obviously will be wrong when it comes to details.  American history is full of protests, marches, riots, assemblies and movements, and it of course is part of who we are.  A study of 19th and early 20th Century labor history, will show lots of facts to back that up.

As for the slave comment, sure, we owned slaves, and we aren't proud of it, and causes a lot of bi-polar and split-personality behavior from us culturally.  I freely admit it was far from our finest moment, and most Americans know it.  The point I believe I was trying to make is, is that I feel Europeans get more worked up about their right of free speech and protest and the rights behind it, because historically it wasn't as available as it is now.  A cultural memory makes them more vocal about it, and any attempts to suppress personal freedoms in many (though clearly not all) European countries spark a sort of national memory and identity reaction.  Think of it as a very hurtful insult personally and the way you would react to it.

That's how Americans feel about guns.  It's a part of who we are in our cultural identity and it's very pervasive in our culture.  To attack or perceived to be attacked on those grounds is similar to a personal insult and will illiicit that reaction in many of us.

I did not intend it to be a pompous comment, more of a comparison in how we view certain things.

As for the second quote you cited, I used that as an example not to be taken literally.  While you may not know anyone personally who gets that worked up, I am almost sure that there are people in your country who do.  Perhaps a better phrasing would have worked better.

And finally, yes.  Americans love bombastic and frankly stupid rhetoric.  As we speak, one of our most famous comedians, who is also one of our most respected social commentators (Jon Stewart), is really trying to drive this point home.  His most famous quote from his rally in Washington a few months back was, ""When we amplify everything, we hear nothing.""  So yes, I freely admit, most Americans love over the top rhetoric.

Nobody was poor in the Soviet Union? How about the millions who died in the famine of the 1930s? In a famine, moreover, that was partly man-made, the result of reckless and punitive collectivization policies and sheer callousness on the part of the regime?

Most of the Soviet Union was dirt poor in the 1920s, much like most of Russia had been under the Tsars. For the mass majority of peasants, the 1930s were, if anything, worse. Then came the mass destruction and hunger of WW2, and the grim first years of reconstruction. Those were of course not the Soviets' own fault, but still, that already takes you halfway through Soviet history.

Things got a lot better in the 50s and 60s of course, and it's no wonder that many older Russians think back of those years as the good old days, despite the lack of democracy, repression of all dissent, and numbing ideology and bureaucracy. But nevertheless, through to the 80s there still remained millions of people in villages who survived on the kind of basic provisions that would easily have classified you as poor in Western Europe. 

(Not to mention - though that's admittedly no longer about poverty, per se - that even the urban dwellers who had many more conveniences still often had to stand in lines for consumption articles that were already widely available in Western Europe, if they could get them at all.)

You're on the more solid ground, of the two assertions, about crime - in the sense that there was less crime in the Soviet Union than there has been since the fall of communism. But even that needs to be put into context:

A) There was nevertheless a flourishing (and colourful, and brutal) criminal underground in the Soviet Union; 

B) Part of why the overall quantity of crime was lower was because, well, dictatorships tend to be better at deterrence (I hear that crime was low under Mussolini too, and trains rode on time ...)

C) There may have been less violent crime by free agents, but how fair is it to compare only petty and gangster crime between the Soviet Union and the West, without adding in the criminal acts of violence by state actors as well? There were arguably a lot more of those in the Soviet Union...

Chancellor Schroeder had made clear their intent to leave 
Brussels around 1:30 pm, due to pressing business elsewhere 
in Europe. With time slipping away for a deal, Papadopoulos 
balked at a mere declaration. Finally, de Gooijer recalled, 
President Chirac said, Tassos, look. Tony, Gerhard and I 
all think this is a good solution. We have not much time. I

reached out for Papadopoulos, saying, Now let us go into the 
meeting. And with that, de Gooijer said, Chirac shepherded

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'll respond to this in a very general manner -- I'm happy to engage in further discussion on the condition that we take it to /r/guns where it's more on topic.  Despite the strong pro gun rights tenor there, you'll find a lot of reasonable people who're always willing to engage in a constructive debate (just ignore the idiots).

&gt; The ""crazy gun nut"" thinks he/she needs to be ready for war against his own government

Actually, this is a very small minority.  I was more referring to the people who run around shooting ranges in camouflage despite never having been in any armed forces, who needlessly accessorize perfectly good firearms, and who talk tough about shooting bad guys.  By far the biggest pet peeve of mine is the frequent mindless assignation of nonsense labels like ""liberals"" and ""conservatives"", or ""patriots"".  Especially the latter is an indicator of deep moronitude.

Also, your statement makes a few false underlying assumptions.  I'd be happy to discuss it in detail, see above.

In my experience, most (not all) anti-gun arguments I've encountered in Europe tend to be founded on one or more of the following:

- sweeping generalizations and stereotypes
- arguments founded on personal fears, prejudices, and dislikes (this is the most common one IMHO)
- false statistics (or no statistics) based on personal presumptions (e.g. the line I quoted in my earlier post)
- incorrect facts
- false causality (_post hoc ergo prompter hoc_) -- one of my favorites.  Often, this goes hand in hand with a failure to incorporate cultural / economic / social / political / historical context
- ad hominem attacks (I'll include the very common snotty or condescending tone in this)
- false dichotomies
- argumentative evasion (i.e. bring up a point, see it rebutted, don't address the rebuttal but rather move on to the next argument)

A fun challenge, that I personally am very bad at, is to look at an argument you feel strongly about...and seek out viewpoints opposite your own.  Then, try to remove your personal bias and prejudice and attempt to spot fallacies as objectively as possible.  It can be pretty amusing.

Your best bet is to get a « sans engagement » contract (which means that you can cancel it whenever you want.)

For example, Simplicime (MVNO on the SFR network) has a 23€/month « forfait sans engagement » with ""unlimited"" data.

As for coverage, all three networks are reasonably equivalent. Where they aren't, the maps are so lacking in details that you can't make any useful decision just by looking at them.

You'll get no argument from me there -- it's idiotic.

&gt; I think the gun owners want to have a problem with everybody else while there isn't

This is a double generalization.

&gt; the pointlessness of having a gun in modern society

This is an assumption, and I dispute it.

...unless you're a sportsman, but yes.  That is exactly the argument that sensible gun rights advocates keep making in the face of hyperbolic, sensationalist nonsense.

I actually have zero fear from the kind of people that many Europeans would probably associate with the stereotypical ""gun freak"" (your words).

They're occasionally annoying, and probably more than a little crazy in their own way, but they're harmless.  

&gt; what makes a person who doesn't believe in gun ownership

No. No no no no no no no.

If you have a well-reasoned argument, one that you have thought through, based on facts, then you are not expressing ""knee-jerk anti-gun sentiment"".  The fallacies and behaviors I listed are used by a subset of people who don't ""believe in gun ownership"".  

By itself, having an issue with guns at any level does not make anyone crazy or a moron.  What does, however, is when that person uses dishonest, emotional, exaggerated, ill-founded, dismissive arguments for their beliefs.

Those are all things Europeans have taken up from an American example.. but don't tell them it'll hurt their feelings ;(

Cultures change, and that's a good thing. That's why ""culture"" as a term is undefinable. To me it seems like a very straight down the line unfair  statement to try to explain American culture as being defined by gun ownership when there are enough examples of Americans who really hate guns. It's like a San Francisco bar keeper stating American culture is defined by the love between men. You can't even make ""culture is"" statement about something as ubiquitous as religion.

&gt;That's how Americans feel about guns. It's a part of who we are in our cultural identity and it's very pervasive in our culture. To attack or perceived to be attacked on those grounds is similar to a personal insult and will illiicit that reaction in many of us.

Ah, yes the same ""reckless and punitive collectivization policies"" that fed the Chinese Nation for the first time in 6 thousand years history and slowly moved them to prosperity of unknown levels.

Everybody I know that lived in the Soviet Bloc would tell you the same thing. Society was equally poor and rich. There were some guys who had more and some who had less, but nobody was feeling left behind. If you had it in you, you could go from the daughter of generations of illiterate peasants to become an engineer. Not a myth, this is my mom and dad's story. With food costing a few cents being paid a couple of dollars wouldn't exactly make you poor. It's not an absolute truth but at the time up until the fall of communism, class related problems never occurred. I'm not here to defend communism. But I want to take a stand against this insinuating bullshit going on as arguments about anything, even gun ownership. Let's say you're right.. for all those years everybody under communism were starving poor bastards; how exactly does this mean the EU is the Soviet Union is beyond fucking me.

&gt;through to the 80s there still remained millions of people in villages who survived on the kind of basic provisions that would easily have classified you as poor in Western Europe.

I can assure you there were a lot of places in ""Western Europe"" that were just like that, and still are. Modernization doesn't automatically mean prosperity. Using wood to warm up in the winter and keeping animals in barns isn't being poor. In fact lots of those people are much more happy and healthy living like that. Can't see how a peaceful and unmodernized life is being poor. Sure ""compared to Western Europe"" the whole freaking world is a shitty place. Sure.

&gt;despite the lack of democracy, repression of all dissent, and numbing ideology and bureaucracy

That is something I can agree with. Although it is greatly hyperbolic.  A lot of those repressive mechanisms were driven by The Cold War and other extremes like WWII. If NATO wasn't breathing in its neck, representing democracy as the ENEMY, things would have been hugely different. Lack of democracy occurred in all those places and still is a factor in the ""Western World"". The KKK had over 5 million members at the time Stalinism took all those victims.

First, I just realized you are a truly ignorant  and self-righteous person. There was a time when I thought Europeans on average were less ignorant of world affairs than Americans, but people like you have showed that Europeans are just as ignorant, but are more arrogant in their ignorance. Have you ever even been outside of Europe?

Tens of millions charging the Brazilian government demanding revolution? Please tell me when this happened. The people you are talking about is known as the MST and they have around 2 million people not tens of millions. They have never charged the Brazilian government. They do organize protest. Very few demands of theirs have been met. I know the government does redistribute land, but doesn't give them much. For the most part they are ignored in Brazil. 

Do you want to keep talking about Brazil? I lived there for some time, so I can help clear up your ignorance. I can also educate you about the USA. When it comes to Germany I don't know much, although I have spent considerable time in other parts of Europe, but I don't pretend to be an expert in Germany like you do with the USA/Brazil.

&gt;A lot of those repressive mechanisms were driven by The Cold War and other extremes like WWII. If NATO wasn't breathing in its neck, representing democracy as the ENEMY, things would have been hugely different. [..] The KKK had over 5 million members at the time Stalinism took all those victims. 

NATO didn't even exist yet when Stalin unleashed the Great Terror. The Cold War hadn't started yet. You can't apologize Stalin's mass murder with references to those.

(Edit: come to think of it, the height of the Cold War actually coincided with a *lessening* of terror in the Soviet Union, after the death of Stalin. Not that there was a relationship between the two things ... just saying: any argument that Soviet repression was ""driven by the Cold War and [..] WWII"" is pretty ahistorical, considering that the worst of Soviet repression took place before either Cold War or WW2 had started, and actually decreased at the height of the Cold War.)

Take some responsibility for your own shit, is what I want to say to such arguments.

German Pop, sometimes poetic, very characteristic voice.

another one (about his ex-wife/-girlfriend having a new boyfriend/husband):

or this one about his hometown Bochum, some consider this the inofficial hymn of Bochum, the song is called Tief im Westen:

I do not have to mention Rammstein, I think. I need more information to mention more as there are many. What do you like? Dance, HipHop, Pop, Rock? Techno (but there is no text most of the time)?

If you want to learn a language the best, visit Germany on vacation or student exchange (most younger Germans can also speak English so you have a backup and in case of emergency) or team up with a „Tandem-Partner“ (my brother called it that) a German person in the US that learns English and who can teach you German in exchange, spend time, speaking a certain amount of English, then German. My brother learned Spanish that ways before he ever went to Spain.

Okay, enough talk, here are some different German music videos:

Xavier Naidoo - Frei sein (German HipHop/Pop)

Die Künstlergruppe Farbchimären präsentiert nicht nur Ihre Kunstwerke, sondern verspricht mit Lesungen, Konzerten und einer Tanzperformance abwechslungsreiche Highlights.

In München mangelt es nicht an Ausstellungen und kulturellen Veranstaltungen, aber es ist nur ein gewisser Proz...entsatz der Bevölkerung, der regelmäßig an solchen Events teilnimmt. Meist handelt es sich dann um Events etablierter und namhafter Künstler über die man „spricht“. Die Künstlergruppe Farbchimären will zeigen, dass es auch anders geht. Inspirierende und beeindruckende Kunstwerke findet man nicht nur in den Museen und Galerien unserer Stadt, sondern gerade auch in kleineren Kulturräumen, in denen sich die Künstler selbst präsentieren. Hier geht es nicht um Honoratioren, sondern um ehrliche hautnahe Kunst, die im Gegensatz zur Stille in den Museen oft laut und lebendig daher kommt.
Die Farbchimären sind eine Gruppe bildender Künstler aus München und dem Umland. Seit drei Jahren etwa zeigen sich die sehr unterschiedlichen Künstler auf Gemeinschaftsausstellungen im bayrischen Raum. Mit immer neuen Ideen und geselligen Künstlerfesten, die den Klischees über das Künstlerleben alle Ehre machen, haben sich die Mitglieder der Gruppe inzwischen schon einen Namen gemacht, der für künstlerische Vielfalt und einer zeitgemäßen Toleranz und Achtung gegenüber der Andersartigkeit steht. Auch im Nymphenburger Kulturpavillon zeigen die 9 bildenden Künstler eine große Bandbreite zeitgenössischer Kunst: abstrakten Expressionismus, Nihonismus, realistische Landschaftsmalerei, Skulpturen, Fotografie, Druckgrafiken…. Im hinteren Bereich der Ausstellung wird es außerdem eine abgetrennte Abteilung mit dem Titel „Abgründe“ geben, die nichts für zartbesaitete Gemüter ist. In der Sonderausstellung des in München ansässigen Vereins Kunstrefugium e.V., dem alle Farbchimären angehören, gibt es Kunstwerke mit zwei Seiten zu sehen. Auf der Vorderseite zeigt sich ein schönes, normales Motiv – auf der Rückseite aber wird der Betrachter mit etwas Abgründigem, Schockierendem bzw. Hässlichem konfrontiert. Natürlich nehmen die beiden Seiten der Kunstwerke aufeinander Bezug. Um den Blick hinter die Fassade besonders eindrucksvoll zu gestalten, wird die Sonderausstellung regelmäßig gewendet, so dass es nur jeweils die schöne oder die hässliche Seite zu sehen gibt. Der Rezipient ist aufgefordert, sich ganz auf diesen „totalen“ Zustand einzulassen – mit den Künstlern auf eine Reise zu gehen in die gefühlte Hölle.
Aber darüber hinaus geht es den Künstlern bei dieser Ausstellung um Vernetzung verschiedener künstlerischer Ausdrucksformen und so wird in den Abendveranstaltungen auch Musik, Tanz und Literatur dargeboten. Die Veranstaltung „Tatort Kunst“ ist als Erlebnisausstellung konzipiert, die auch „kulturscheue“ Menschen anlocken soll und aufzeigt, wie spannend kulturelle Events sein können, auch wenn nicht der große Kunstmarkt oder angesagte Musikproduzenten dahinter stehen. „Tatort Kunst“ will Menschen Lust machen auf Kultur, neugierig auf künstlerische Talente, mit denen man noch ins Gespräch kommen kann, vielleicht auch einen neuen Zugang zu Kunst öffnen, wo man im anerkannten Kunstmarkt oft ratlos zurück bleibt. Kultur ist nichts Elitäres für eine kleine gebildete Upper Class, sondern der kreative Ausdruck unserer Gesellschaft. Kultur ist, solange sie Subkultur ist, bezahlbar und damit für jeden zugänglich. Sie kann laut und lebendig sein, einen Diskurs mit dem Rezipienten zulassen und so ganz nah am Prozess des Kultur Schaffens Teil haben lassen. Tatort Kunst bedeutet Vielseitigkeit, Neues und Ungewöhnliches entdecken und Spaß haben an Kunst.
Die Ausstellung und alle Abendveranstaltungen sind kostenlos zugänglich. Die Öffnungszeiten sind täglich zwischen dem 04.02. und 18.02. von 15 – 19 Uhr. Die Abendveranstaltungen finden jeweils Freitag und Samstag um 19 Uhr statt, an den ersten beiden Sonntag gibt es einen Kinderworkshop für die Kleinen, als kulinarisches Highlight lockt eine Weinprobe und eine Kaffeedegustation.

Not a single soldier has stepped on and will never want to step on Serbia, but the Serbs are not the usual Christian neighbors of Peace and tranquility in reciprocity.

No one better to explain Serbs than the modern founder of Serbia: 

** “We lie to deceive ourselves, to console others, we lie for mercy, we lie to fight fear, to encourage ourselves, to hide our and somebody else's misery. We lie for love and honesty.

The other options always require you to have the SIM send to your place in Germany which can take 2-3 days, so I guess the supermarket ones are a better choice. You usually just buy em at the store and then activate them online.

As far as I remember there are:  
- Fonic (sold at Lidl supermarkets)  
- Medion Mobile/Aldi Talk (sold at Aldi supermarkets)


Fonic will cost you 9 cents/minute for calls to the US and they have a ""[Handy-Internet Paket](http://www.fonic.de/html/tarif_zusatz_handy-internet-paket.html)"" that costs 9,95 Euros and will give you 500 MB of data at UMTS/HSDPA speeds (after the 500 MB, they cap it to GPRS speeds. Still enough for emails and other small stuff). To cancel the internet service, just send an SMS with the text „STOP HANDYINTERNET” to 36642.


Aldi talk will cost you 12 cents/min to call the US and the [Internet Flatrate](http://www.alditalk.de/web/internet-prepaid-tarif/flatrates/handy_internet_flatrate/index.php) will cost you 7,99 €

Tchibo mobil might also be interesting if you can find a tchibo shop

The ""rotten free market game"" did not cause the crisis.  Poor regulation, corrupt accounting, nonsensical public finances, unsustainable social costs (ohai, Greece), inefficient allocation of resources (ohai, CAP), EU expansion at all costs, and a lot of other factors caused it.

Freedom of trade and exchange is the biggest achievement of the EC/EU.  For all my dislike of the EU and its institutions, the common market and things like Schengen are nothing short of miraculous.  To sacrifice that under some misguided guise of tightening down ""rampant capitalism"" or similar nonsense buzzphrases, without fixing the underlying corruption that's causing all this, would be idiotic and suicidal.

I'd like to see how Merkel proposes to deal with things like the ""more robust economies"" repeatedly violating the original stability &amp; growth pact in the run up to the Euro by spending like drunken sailors.

Unless the EU invests a _lot_ of effort in enforcement of its existing fiscal rules, and in setting clear punishments for delinquent, irresponsible members, the bond and currency markets are going to see this as a joke.

&gt; While it would be nice to be able to write a story about how one ISP defied the government’s orders in Egypt to provide its users with an essential service, the reality seems to be far more mundane.
&gt; According to France’s Le Monde, Noor provides essential services to the Egyptian stock exchange in Cairo. Thanks to this, the stock exchange’s site is one of the few Egyptian sites still available online. In addition, Le Monde also writes, Noor provides services to large multi-national corporations, including Coca-Cola, Pfizer and Exxon Mobile. Domestically, Noor also provides network services to Egypt Air. Because of this, Noor is likely considered to be an important economic asset and will probably continue operating throughout this crisis. We have to wonder, though, why the company wasn’t able to keep these business services up and running and cut its regular subscribers off at the same time.

Das ist dann wohl die gleiche Geschichte wie, dass Siemens/Nokia im Iran ""lawful interception"" ausgeliefert haben -- ohne Kooperation mit der ""law enforcement"" kann man allerdings auch in westlichen Staaten wie Deutschland, Frankreich oder den USA keine Kommunikationsinfrastruktur durchsetzen.
