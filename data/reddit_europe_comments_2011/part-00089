true,JB_UK,null,null,"I suppose there are various ways you can break this down. 

First, the most direct, the Euro gave countries enough rope to hang themselves: they were able to take on in the short term much more debt than otherwise because of lowered interest rates. Then their traditional escape route would be devaluation, but that has been blocked off by the loss of monetary policy to an external, strictly anti-inflationary central bank. And the politics of that situation, of an external authority enforcing not only tight monetary policy, but also now the scale of austerity, strikes me as thoroughly poisonous and unsustainable.

Second, there are questions about the fundamental viability of a single currency across diverse economies. I don't understand the current-account imbalance argument, but it's clear that the lack of synchronized business cycles has done damage. When the ECB was keeping rates low to lever Germany out of its post 2000 doldrums, it was superheating a Spanish housing bubble. And Spain, even as one of the most fiscally prudent countries in the EU, with low debt and a significant surplus pre-crisis, has still been torpedoed by the current crisis and then dismissed airily as Mediterranean.

A lot of this was brought up from the start, but the criticism wasn't heeded for one reason or another. I know many of the subsequent critiques were dismissed as political.

true,amatriain,null,null,"&gt;A true democracy is not possible because most people are ignorant

I'll try to keep my disgust in check and answer you in a reasonable tone.

If we assume a true democracy is not possible because some people (most of them, you said) are too ignorant, then it follows that some (most?) people should simply not have a say in their government, for the sake of the common good.

But who will decide whether I am wise enough to play a meaningful role in such a noocracy? You? A EU funcionary? Will there be a battery of standardized tests to check if I am educated enough, up to date enough in current events and of course whether I hold the ""right"" opinions to be recognized as part of the illuminated ellite?

Let's leave aside for the moment the fact that I will forcefully oppose any attempt to declare me, and most of mankind, unfit to decide my own fate. 

What will happen in such a regime is that those already in power will quickly declare themselves, and only themselves and those who uphold them, fit to govern. What will happen then is that decision-making will happen behind closed doors, with no public scrutiny (after all if the general public is unfit to have a say in political decisions, then keeping them informed is a waste of time). What will happen is that those who would criticize and oppose the current regime will be excluded from the res publica, because once you have the power to declare people unfit to participate in public discourse, it's too tempting and too easy to do it to your adversaries. What will happen is that even if some pretense of upholding the common good is kept, in truth the ruling elite will be ruling for themselves and for those with interests aligned with their own.

Because that's the sad truth of human nature. Give a group of people enough power and funds and too little oversight, and you will have corruption, nepotism and a push to concentrate power and funds even further in their hands. Every.  Single. Time. It's been said before but it bears repeating: **ONLY PUBLIC OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY CAN KEEP A GOVERNMENT HONEST**.

That's the problem we have now. Worldwide, not just in the EU. The problem is not that the public is unfit to participate in politics. The problem is that the public is not allowed to participate enough in politics. We choose representatives, and then those representatives have carte blanche until the next elections to operate with almost-zero accountability. As @dageshi said above, it's outrageous that if a referendum does not go the way the ruling elite wants, then it's tweaked and passed anyway without popular approval. It's shameful that the rules that govern our lives in the EU are being changed in ways that will profoundly affect our lives, and not a single public vote has been cast. It's enough to make one furious that when the greeek PM threatened to call for a referendum in his country, politicians in the EU had the nerve to call him ""irresponsible"".

This is what's happening in Europe right now. And it's a recipe for disaster. Unless you're a Goldman&amp;Sachs executive, I suppose. Then it's handshakes and good career prospects all around.",0,1325150949,null,0,false,0,c3c39kn,t3_nu0xc,t1_c3c39kn,t1_c3c07y3,1428091692,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

But i warn you that you wont enjoy it much, seems google can't handle our language perfectly.

The article describes that the spokesperson of the media authority complains that they were under pressure for a year to give Klubradio its frequency, to tailor their procedure so that Klubradio surely receives a frequency.

It seems that the biggest deciding factor was the price: the winner Autoradio offered 75M HUF, while Klubradio offered 55M HUF for the frequency. So Autoradio got 15, while Klubradio got 11 points for the price offer. It is 30% bigger offer from Autoradio, for which they got 30% more points. Klubradio has scored better on experience and public service, and the media authority assigned maximum points to Klubradio on subjective scoring. Finally they scored one point less than the winner, Autoradio.

If Klubradio did get the frequency due to the political pressure, then the other four entrants would now complain. It is actually typical for the socialists, they would have decided politically, as they did when they were in power.

If you want to find resemblance to a dictatorship, you will find more in how the previous government worked. Their laws were super-liberal, but they just governed trough background deals, incriminated people using the secret service, or put people into paying positions just to keep their mouths shut, and those super-liberal laws served the purpose that it was easy to get around them. Contrary to that style, the new government makes tougher laws, less comfortable, closer to reality than the ideals, but makes things more transparent too, since its hard to make background deals.

The Mediterrean was christian a long time before the Dark Ages, see Constantine etc. The Dark Ages  began with the influx of illiterate barbarians where the church was the only organization to preserve some scraps of ancient learning, although originally only for stylistic purposes. It took a few centuries for the church to civilize the barbarians and then around the 1200's, with the beginning of Scholastic Thomism a period of serious philosophical work began, using Greek texts preserved by the Islamic Golden Age which was then destroyed by Al-Ghazali's occasionalism, and already in the 1300's Europe became the center of learning. Thomism was a seriously logical and rationalistic system, underappreciated now as the focus was not so strongly on empiricism and the natural sciences as now, as our age tends to undervalue the human sciences, philosophy etc. in favor of the natural sciences, the preferences back then were the other way around. Concepts like just war theory or the basics of economics were developed in the Scholastic age.

true,ambitiousbutrubbish,null,null," I don't think the ""cooking the books"" argument is a serious one. It is totally true, i'm not disputing this in any way, but it is also something spoon fed to the public as a half truth. Greece cooked the books, like others have done, from way before the creation of the eurozone. In the case of fulfilling the criteria for joining the eurozone, Goldman Sachs were paid $300 ml to help with their recipe for cooking. 

 Are we, the European public, to believe that the rest of the EU did not know this was happening? Not even a suspicion? What are they, stupid? No, in fact Greece was not the only country doing this. I don't have too much time to spend in google for this but i quickly came up with [this article](http://www.theweek.co.uk/business/16599/evidence-mounts-greece-cooked-books), here's a quote: 

&gt;But others point out that cooking the books is not so unusual: both France and Germany have at various times sold off assets to trim deficits. ""Fiddling the books has become the order of the day,"" Karl Heinz Däke, president of a German taxpayers' lobby group, once explained. ""The German government and other European countries are hiding their cards from the public.""

 So lets not pretend to be shocked by the book cooking. I believe it was more of a lets all look the other way situation, than a big scandal that caught everyone by surprise. 

 Of course it is still bad. It is fraud. But its not something to be pinned solely on the Greek side, or something exremely huge. The huge guilt of Greece should be borrowing to feed the government workers/friends/relatives while shutting down remaining industry and a general looting of the economy.

 p.s. To introduce another angle to the Greek issue: Cyprus is drilling for natural gas. Greece has gas also. Lots of it. Why doesn't Greece and the rest of the EU do a natural gas for debt swap? Gas will be bought from somewhere either way. Why not even *start* doing this to solve part of the problem? Greek debt is huge as a % of GDP, but at less than 400 bn euros it is not huge in absolute numbers, at least compared to other states'. I will venture to say that selling rights to exploration/drilling would let Greece cover payment of debt interest in a significant portion at least, without borrowing more in a vicious spiral. Because currently we are borrowing and are *not* covering even the interest payments.

No one is forced to be boss of the ECB.

Blaming others for Trichet's mess, when the buck stops at his desk, is just more limp evidence the French ""don't get it"".

Decisions are taken, policies implemented, consequences flow.

It's not an intellectual discussion. 

Saying it's not Trichet's fault and it was all a consensus thing, which the Anglo-Saxons don't want to ""believe"", will not bring the parrot back to life. 

As for that buck toothed, twit Baroness Ashton of Upholland, she was just jobbed in by Brown to annoy Blair.    No doubt much to the delight of her fellow Commissioners because I am sure they can see no reason to take her seriously since no one in England does.

That's exactly my point. We are being controlled by economists (and not the kind that understand economic science) and their rich friends who only want power for themselves.

The response from the EU in this case has been very different: there's been such pressure and threat of sanctions, forceful expulsion from the euro etc, that all such countries have had to agree to apply extreme cuts to lower their deficits. At least in the case of Spain the EU has forced the government to make this unbelievable change to the constitution: that by law a foreign lender's right to be paid by Spain has precedence over any spanish citizen's right to receive payments, services or anything from the government.

That's very interesting and I think very revealing of the euroseptic mindset: it's not perfect so we won't participate (amusingly enough the very same argument was used by both far-left and far-right parties in France campaigning against the Constitution Treaty in 2005). Trichet made the choice to participate and further its goals from the inside. I'm not suggesting that this is vastly superior to the alternative, mind you. It's an age old debate.

I would have hoped you could divide 17 by 60 yourself.

It comes out at a bit more than 8%.

Just as the Barnett Formula comes out at c. 10% rather than c. 8%, which could be a difference of 2% of the 100% and 25% of the 8%.

I hope I'm not keeping too much of a count here but I thought adding up the bill was a Scottish quality.

As for whether an independent Scotland is sustainable now, I think it quite probably is.

Although we all know that if Scotland had been independent in 2007 it would most assuredly be sustainably bankrupt now.

Scotland outside the UK would not be able to afford the mistakes it makes within the UK. 

However, it would be able to disport itself with it's 7 EU council votes, giving it less influence than Bulgaria (10), Hungary (12) and Belgium (12).

And for the ""rump"" UK, as Scots are so condescendingly inclined to describe what these islands free of Scottish drag would be called,  to lose 2 of 29 Council votes to get shot of the ever-bitching Scots looks like good numbers to me.

Going to Venice also is a pretty big trip.  Except between Turin and Venice, do not count on doing more than 55-60 mph.

Night of Jan 3-4 - Florence

Nights of Jan 5-6 - Rome

 - Jan 7 - Bologna pit stop (if you have time)

 - Jan 9 - daytrip to Venice by train (Venice has exactly one parking and cars are obviously not allowed in the city)

You will be aware that international banking norms are that the territory in which the bank operates provides the bailout funds.

Yes and no. Let's assume we have independence. Clearly there are still RBS branches operating in England. Nat West is a RBS subsidiary and it has branches open in England. These would all have to operate, if they are not already, as English registered companies paying their payroll and corporation taxes to the English Treasury. The ""investment banking"" companies operating in the City of London would similarly have to register in England. So it would be operating in both countries. I'm sure if you search Companies House you will find that a large number of RBS's subsidiaries are actually registered as English companies at the moment.

* The inability of the Barnett formula to cope with population changes.

The Barnett formula calculates the block grant by taking your previous year amount and adding the change in spending in England, multiplied by a population %. Scotland's population fell from 1979 and has only just gotten back to that level whilst the population of England and Wales has grown steadily over the same period. Even if you continually change the population percentage you apply to the annual change you still have the previous year amount - which related to a higher population. So the imbalance has built up.

The debate over Barnett is sterile, however, as it only looks at one side (expenditure) and does not include a discussion of ""Unidentifiable Expenditure"".

true,Prestian,BELG,"Flanders, Belgium","&gt; Sorry but I don't buy that. We need to stop acting like the nation-states that were formed in the 18/19th century are somehow sacred and should never be re-evaluated. In the case of Belgium the democracies in the constituent regions demand different governance (as evidenced by the fact that they vote in majority for polar opposites of the political spectrum) and the different socio-economic situations outright require it. This doesn't mean that you need to split up the country; a confederation could also work, but since the francophones are completely blocking this they're not leaving us with much of an alternative.

1) I don't think the current borders are sacred. On the contrary. I believe we should let those borders go, in Europe. Not by forming the United States of Europe (which would be great, but which isn't really realistic), but by letting go those narrow-minded nationalistic feelings.

2) One election doesn't proof anything. Last elections did show a huge polarisation, but how can you say that this is permanent? We just had 8 years, where all of Belgium voted for the ""Purple parties"" (socialists &amp; liberals).

3) I don't think that *only* the francophones are blocking the country. The weird fetish towards BHV by the Flemish parties was blocking the country just as much. I even think that Elio Di Rupo has done a big effort to unblock the country (after the Flemish nationalists stepped out of the negociations).

&gt; The size of a country has nothing to do with what the most efficient form of government is. Denmark has a smaller population than an independent Flanders would have and they seem to be doing just fine. I'm sure they'll be glad to hear they have no self-determination either -&gt; i.e. this is a semantic discussion, you're interpreting self-determination too absolutely.

Flanders might be able to make it's government more efficient, but that really doesn't mean a lot. It's more symbolic.
And of course Denmark doesn't have self-determination. Only big countries can have a grip on the economy. Small countries can't. They might be able to act more efficient.

What we can do is steer this integration in the right direction: A real federation where the principle of subsidiarity is actually followed, where democratic control is embedded at the core of decision making, a union that values liberalism at every level of society from foreign relations to individual rights.

(An aside on subsidiarity: I don't like it because it implies a top-down distribution of power. Power in a federation flows upwards, from the state to the federation, thus the principle of subsidiarity is not necessary; the state chooses which powers to share or not.
