Sa conception des femmes

&gt;Dans L'âme du conquérant, paru en 1998, il compare la conquête d'une femme à « l'excitation de la chasse » et il soutient que la place des femmes est au foyer.
&gt;
&gt;Cette place subordonnée de la femme découle, selon Douillet, de sa nature, et son rôle est inscrit dans ses gènes : « C'est la mère qui a dans ses gènes, dans son instinct, cette faculté originelle d'élever les enfants ».
&gt;
&gt;Selon lui, Dieu aurait déterminé la nature et la place de la femme dans la société :
&gt;
&gt;« Si Dieu a donné le don de procréation aux femmes, ce n'est pas par hasard. »
&gt;
&gt;Dans le même livre, il écrit : « On dit que je suis misogyne, mais tous les hommes le sont. Sauf les tapettes. »

The financial sector is way beyond what it should do, which is being a servant to the real economy. So the real answer is to find ways to cut back the financial sector to a sensible size.

Yes, that would probably only be possible by having a huge recession. Because if 90% of the GDP is in the financial sector and you cut it back to 10% of its size, you end up destroying 80% of your economy.

But I think that in the long run, this is the only way to get the world working like it should. Only governments can start this process. Governments should look into all financial products and find out how much destructive potential lies within them and should regulate them more and more.

Après le Bac, j’ai suivi une formation de deux ans à l’Université. C’était un Deust en vente et négociation. Cette formation a pour but de nous former sur toutes les techniques de vente aussi bien locales qu’internationales. Donc une fois mon diplôme en poche, bien j’arrive sur le marché du travail et là, bien rien.

Là je me suis dit bien allez, qu’est-ce que tu peux faire. Je me suis posée, j’ai regardé ce qui se faisait et ce qui ne se faisait pas à Moorea. Et là j’ai vu qu’il y avait un marché à prendre, le marché des petits et de l’enfant. Et là je me suis dit allez, pourquoi pas !

Donc première des choses je vais voir la Ccism, j’ouvre une patente, et ensuite il faut chercher le point stratégique. Il fallait trouver le financement et c’était là où ça devait un peu compliqué. Moi n’ayant aucune ressources financières, je démarre, je suis jeune, je débute dans la vie, ce n’était pas simple, ce n’était pas gagné d’avance.
Une fois le financement trouvé, j’ai pu ouvrir la boutique. Donc en décembre 2010 la boutique est ouverte, quatre jours avant Noël d’ailleurs et là j’ai bien vu qu’il y avait une réelle demande de la population de Moorea : ils se sont dit enfin une boutique pour bébés à Moorea.
C’est tout ça qui fait que j’aime ce que je fais : d’avoir le contact avec les futures mamans, les mamans qui viennent demander conseil ? C’est tous ces échanges-là qui font que maintenant je me sens bien aujourd’hui.
C’est un peu dur à gérer mais il faut s’accrocher. Et puis moi j’ai la chance d’avoir obtenu des aides donc je bénéficie d’un conseiller qui peut m’aider à tout moment, je l’appelle, pour faire mes déclarations, pour redynamiser la boutique, quand il faut faire de la pub. Et puis le plus important, j’ai le soutien de mon conjoint, de ma famille, ça c’est très important pour se lancer.

Le conseil que je pourrais donner aux jeunes porteurs de projets c’est : allez-y ! Donnez-vous les moyens. Il y a des aides qui existent pour nous mais il faut oser. Être entrepreneur c’est ça, c’est oser prendre des risques. Et puis nous sommes jeunes, c’est un peu notre manière à nous de faire avancer le Pays, de faire avancer les choses. Après vous ne pourrez être que fier de votre projet, vous vous dites : c’est moi qui ai fait ça !

Allez-y, n’hésitez pas ! Moi je l’ai fait et aujourd’hui je suis fière de l’avoir fait. Bon, il y a des fois où ça va, des fois ça ne va pas, mais il faut s’accrocher et puis si vous vous dites que ça va aller, alors ça va aller !

It was very obvious from the beginning of the euro that it could not and would not work as initially designed, but that the architects believed that ultimately once in the euro none of the members would be able to leave and so would be forced to cede further sovereignty to ""europe"" from their own national parliaments.

We are at that stage now, all the bailouts and even this upcoming mega bailout that's being proposed is essentially just throwing cash at the problem hoping to buy time before....

Before the european nations begin the herculean task of trying to convince their populaces that they will have give up direct control over certain issues which are core to their sovereignty, they will become both citizens of a federal europe in the same way that I am both English and a Citizen of the UK.

I wish the eurozone nations good luck, I just wish they'd get on with what we all knew was coming.

I have a different understanding of Europe.

I grew up in the German South-West in the 80s, a few kilometres from the French border, when it still was a real border, a one hour drive to the Swiss border and half of my family living in East-Germany and Poland behind kick-ass borders.

A border is not just a line on a map. A border divides. Language does not care for borders, culture does not care for borders, in fact, human nature does not give a fuck about borders.

One side-effect of borders is that the development in border areas is slowed down; mainly the economy, the cultural exchange, the quality of life.

Different currencies, different laws and standards also can be borders, they also slow exchange and development down.

You might be happy on your island in the sun because you don't know it any different, the borders you have are natural and have always been there. But that is not the case in continental Europe. We know that borders are artificial and arbitrary and changed whenever a chosen dude had an idea coming to his mind.

So, I think, you developed a feeling now for my mentality. And I bet you can guess how much I care for your benevolent financial concerns.

Now in Britain we will have a real choice, we'll have the choice that should have been made available to the peoples of europe ten years ago but wasn't, we'll have a choice whether to join a federal europe or not, there will be reasons to do so for and against but we will have that choice.

I do not understand how you can pretend that does not matter, the euro member countries will not have that choice now, the most important decision for perhaps the next 100+ years which will affect them and their children has effectively been imposed on them, they will accept it or they will face economic ruin, my country on the other hand will make that choice knowing its full import and consequences.

Is it a scam? Is it a trap? For me now, of course not, I will get to cast my vote and make my decision knowing what I'm really getting, can you and your countrymen say the same thing?

true,[deleted],null,null,"Hi there, here's mine. First, a bit of background for you people living outside of the absurd world. This isn't coming out of the blue. The Romas have clans which can be very numerous in size. I don't really know how those are structured but often times they have a strong hierarchy and do not recognize any other authority. This particular clan chief guy is officially known as The King and is like a Gypsy superstar... a Gypsy King if you will. On top of every clan there's a rich family that runs everything - from crime rings to political representation. Clans can easily mobilize and have a system of ""reacting"".

There have been some clan vs. clan clashes before with riots and murder. I guess Sicily comes to mind but I don't want to offend anyone. Just like in this case the chief family has some sort of political umbrella and involves a ton of corruption. They are *""rich and powerful""* and have some discriminatory relationship towards poorer ethnic Bulgarians. Often times you would see a Roma clan vs. ethnic Bulgarians situation in places where clans have the upper hand. It goes a bit like this:

- there's some ethnic tension that has been building, mostly connected to petty crime and people just being extremely poor (in this particular case it all started with poor Bulgarians rioting against a rich Roma family)
- some incident happens; a girl's been raped, someone badly beaten or like in this case killed
- there's some sort of reaction depending on which side feels wronged; either a clan gets mobilized and trashes ethnic Bulgarian property or right wind structures (neo-nazis, football hooligans, etc.) of the big cities use the momentum to let their aggression loose on minorities
- police is absolutely inadequate and there is even worse crimes piling up
- the whole country starts a conversation about the Romas; ethnic tension is being released, most people calling for Hitler to come back and save us and the occasional voice of reason trying to calm everything down
- in a few weeks time it's all been forgotten; yet just another really embarrassing moment

Good idea. There [is one](http://www.uni-due.de/en/index.php), and the new semester should start next week. That means tons of new students will flock to the city, and most of them won't know anybody yet and they will try to make friends as well. They will hang out in the Mensa (cafeteria) or its vicinity, possibly cafés nearby, during the day, and they will go to bars at night. Note that next week will be the introduction week, so whole faculties of new students will have events at the same time and may or may not be around. Official uni cafés are [here](http://studentenwerk.essen-duisburg.de/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=10) (click on ""Lageplan"" for a map).  

[This](http://www.kkc-essen.de/) appears to be a popular hangout for students, close to the uni.

There should be an ""Erstsemesterparty"" or ""Ersti-party"" (party for first semseter students, older ones will come as well) or ""Semesteranfangsparty"" (to celebrate the beginning of the new semester), sometime soon. You could email the AStA (student representation) at oeffentlichkeit(at)asta-due.de and ask for dates/locations, they'll almost certainly will be public. While you're at it, you could ask for other places or events you could go to that aren't uni-related. There will be a student on the other end of the emails, so maybe s/he will have a some recommendations.

There's something for international students, their [PDF](http://studentenwerk.essen-duisburg.de/pdf/Internationales.pdf) mentions social activities for international students (it has some English text if you look for it). Email that friendly looking girl on the first page and ask about those cinema or barbecue evenings and whether you can come.

At some point they are going to have to face up to the fact that they are the ones with most to lose; they are the ones who profit most from the union; and they stood with all the other EU nations and said nothing while corporations based in their country made arms sales and provided inappropriately easy credit to Greece (and to a lesser extent the other PIIGS) contributing to the large debts.

A couple of months ago two police officers arrested a 19 year old gypsy for stealing. Someone was recording the ""interrogation"" with a cell phone, so it leaked on the web. It turns out that the police officer slapped him, and kicked him in the foot. He sustained no heavy injuries, didn't even fall on the ground. Now let me now say that I am against police brutality in a way that you're tased to death, that a police officer kicks the living shit out of you, but I think that an occasional slap or two can indeed help. 

Anyway, like I said, the video leaked on the web, and there was a mass outrage. The general public shrugged it off, but the politicians sort of made a big deal about it, hoping for the EU candidacy status by the end of the year. The Minister of Police apologized in public, and handed him a gift (don't remember what it was). The guy claimed how he was a decent student, a nice person, and how he does not fit the general gypsy stereotype. He was polite and nice and all, so I even believed him.

List the large brick-and-mortar banks, point out the difference between the commercial ones and Volksbank/Sparkasse, add that there are online banks and give a few popular examples. Point out that withdrawing from the wrong ATM pool can be expensive.

Regarding mobile phones, there should be a description of the four networks (coverage, bandwidth, and no, your American CDMA phone won't work), their discount brands, then the large virtual networks and that there are resellers.  
Here, we probably should have recommendations for typical usage scenarios (e.g., Internet with a prepaid contract), but I think there always should be at least three (if there are three similarly viable options).

Io sono uno studente stutunitense (è corretto ma di solito si dice americano) *che studia* (non si può usare il gerundio come si usa la forma in -ing in inglese, in senso relativo: quindi ""che studia"" o ""e studio"") italiano all'università. Studio la lingua da 4 anni, e dopo un *semestre* a Milano vorrei iscrivermi per *un esame* (niente apostrofo, è maschile) d'italiano come lingua straniera. Ma ci sono troppe opzioni, non so come scegliere *(niente ""ne"", al limite ""scegliere tra queste)*. 

La mia domanda e' questa: c'e' un'esame piu' *rispettato degli altri*? Ho trovato quelli di TELC, L'universita' per i Stranieri di Siena, e quella di Perugia.

Mi sa che ho molto da fare per prepararmi per qualche esame, ma questa lingua e' un *divertimento* invece di un lavoro (*grammaticalmente corretto, ma forse meglio ""più che un lavoro""*)  per me.

The way I see it, the problem is that since Greece can't control the value of their coin and the ECB won't let Germany have a little inflation the only way for Greece to be more competitive again is deflation. As we all know,  deflation seriously fucks up an economy. Now if the ECB would allow for some inflation in Germany (by lowering interest rates to zero or close), Greece would become more competitive just by having less or no inflation at all (which would probably happen with all the austerity measures).

I just need to reflect my own demands: I myself want healthy and harmless foods and high quality standards throughout the whole production chain.
Nevertheless there are guidelines (for the European Union as well as national ones) that take into consideration especially small gastronomy companies and restaurants and enable them to operate under different standards.
For me it seems to be the best protection for the consumer and his or her demands. If standards or regulations would be loosened more for some sectors, as for example for small family restaurants, it may be even harmful since consumers abandon visiting a restaurant where they cannot expect the highest possible health standards.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I think Britain would be quite happy to just be in the single market and little more, the problem is the eurozone will obviously integrate further and being part of that is not something that has popular support in the UK. 

yes, basically like Noway etc, just w/o Shengen. That's quite close to the status it has now, but with a vote, except for defense, where presumably it wishes to participate, and CAP, where it doesn't. And I think this is perfectly fair, if the British so desire - your political elite shouldn't be pushing more Europe than is supported down your throats, thought I think it would be legitimate for them to try convince you its a good idea. However those aren't the only signals coming from the UK, for eg:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15102436
&gt;But the deputy PM, and Lib Dem leader, said that, while the 17 eurozone members must decide the response to the crisis, decisions affecting the whole of the EU must be made by all 27 states.

&gt;He said eurozone states must not be allowed to act against the interests of the others.

&gt;...

&gt;He said any change to ""governance structures must not lead to a weaker and divisive Europe where the aims of 'euro ins' are set against those of 'euro outs'"".

wait, must not be **allowed** to act against the interests of others? Well, Mr Clegg, there is exactly one way to implement this, as you hint when talking about governance - that is for every country outside eurozone to have veto power over the decisions (or, I presume, some decisions) of eurozone members - about affairs where they don't even participate!. A majority vote would indeed mean that countries can and do act against the interest of a particular member, if its worth it overall. So, a UK that doesn't want to be part of any further integration, but with a veto against any such decisions of other countries? how convenient... This is why I think UK's political elite is quite pleased with the current status quo. Well, like I said, luckily there's quite a bit of flexibility for multispeed Europe in Lisbon, still unused, and some of it can be complemented by separate treaties. There are structural bits though, where there is no other way but unanimity...

And by the way...**generally** people in Eastern Europe who have a problem with gypsies don't have a problem because they are gypsies, but because of the way they behave. The very few ones who made an effort to integrate in the civilized society and sent their children to school, and took a job (at least struggled to find one) are seen differently: poor people tring to make a living in an onest way, just like other poor non-gypsies. Nobody has a problem with these people.

It is a very complex situation, no side is 100% right while the other is wrong. Neither gypsies, nor locals (whatever nationality they might be), neither pro-gypsy NGOs, nor right wing groups, neither the West, nor the East.

The main differences are Ireland is smaller and so didn't have the same resources or tax base to handle its bailouts and it was also within euro so it couldn't devalue its currency as we did.

I am *not* implying that British culture is in some way better than either Northern European or Southern European culture, I am saying that attempting to mix all three, in one go, inside one currency, one set of rules while removing all the policy measures that historically have been used to deal with crises is a very very bad idea and it would be best for Britain to avoid it.

For example, in late Wilhelmine Germany, ennobled persons were allowed to add ""von"" to their name, while in Holland and Switzerland you have quite a few ""van"" that have nothing to do with nobility at all (just some ancestor was from a certain place.)  I believe that this is the case in France too.

Many European countries have legal recognition of titles/honorifics - for example, in Germany, if you have a doctorate, your legal name is not ""Herr d Clauzel"" but ""Herr Dr. d Clauzel"".  This goes on official records.

In France, an aristocratic title (""titre de courtoisie"", e.g. compte, baron, etc.) forms part of your proper legal name (décret du 24 janvier 1852).  Wikipedia\*:

&gt; _Les titres de noblesse réguliers sont considérés comme un accessoire du nom et peuvent figurer sur tous les documents administratifs, y compris la carte d'identité._

So you have a democratic republic (!) among whose core three principles is ""égalité"", recognizing archaic feudalisms in official documents and usage.

Note that France isn't the only country which does this.

Add to that the fact that:

&gt; _Il faut aussi noter qu'en France, et contrairement à d'autres pays européens (la Russie17 et l'Empire allemand par exemple), en raison de la loi salique18, les femmes ne portent pas de titres ""en propre"", fors celui de princesse ; considéré alors non comme un titre mais comme le témoignage de leur qualité_

So pretty fucking sexist as well. 

Maybe I'm a horrible anal retentive egalitarian republican fanatic, but this sort of thing really annoys me.
