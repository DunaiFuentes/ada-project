Das ist schon ganz schön weit von der Theorie entfernt, und klingt für mich nach einem Sammelbecken in dem die Konzentration von extremen Fällen so groß ist dass ein normaler Unterricht unmöglich wird, was wiederum anfällige Schüler die sich unter besseren Umständen am Unterricht beteiligen würden selbst zu Störern macht. Dazu kommen dann noch diejenigen die durch die erschwerte Unterrichtssituation unterfordert sind und sich langweilen.

Dazu kommt noch ein weiterer Effekt: Natürlich gibt es einige extreme Fälle die sich in keinen normalen Schulalltag integrieren lassen, egal welcher Form. Schon ein oder zwei von diesen in einer Klasse zu haben macht einen normalen Unterricht unmöglich. Dafür gibt es Sonderschulen mit extra kleinen Klassen und speziell ausgebildeten Lehrern. Allerdings können diese, selbst wenn die Eltern ihre Zustimmung ihr Kind auf eine Sonderschule zu schicken gegeben haben, Schüler mit denen sie unter selbst diesen speziellen Umständen nicht fertig werden, wieder von der Schule schmeissen. Hauptschulen, oder eben diese integrierten Sekundarschulen hingegen können das nicht, und müssen diese ganz extremen Fälle wieder aufnehmen.

Das Ganze *nicht* auf die Schulpolitik zu schieben klingt mir nach Realitätsfremdheit. Ja, natürlich wäre es schön wenn die Schüler alle brav und pflichtbewusst wären, aber die Jugend von heute ist natürlich die schlimmste seit immer (das ist schon so seit Menschengedenken)

Man könnte auf der anderen Seite auch Probleme erkennen und sie nicht auf die Schüler schieben, sondern sich frühzeitig darum kümmern, dass zukünftige Problemfälle sich anders entwickeln. Das kostet natürlich Geld, ist aber Volkswirtschaftlich trotzdem ein großer Gewinn.

Irgendein Politiker hat vor kürzerer Zeit mal angedacht den Kommunen ein Existenzminimum für ihre Pflichtaufgaben zu sichern: Berlin geht's im Moment finanziell so schlecht, dass die Probleme lieber nach hinten verschoben werden anstatt Prävention zu betreiben: Das würde erst erst später Geld sparen.

Ne zweckgebundene Finanzhilfe wäre da sehr, sehr hilfreich, und Berlin stottert seine Schulden halt über Einstampfung von Prestigeprojekten ein, was den Politikern und ihrem Küngel (oder auch nur ""der Wirtschaft"" oder ""dem Tourismus"", Rot/Rot sind schließlich deren Lobbyisten auf ihre eigene Art) vielleicht nich gefällt, aber trotzdem die richtigere Lösung ist.",0,1308508515,null,0,true,0,c20n2t5,t3_i3lsk,t1_c20n2t5,t1_c20mwtt,1427263124,7,false,de,t5_22i0,7

questa personale teoria ha come base l'evidenza dello stato naturale degli esseri viventi tutti (che serve a definire dove c'è l'istinto naturale e dove la parte umana degenera)... ""facendo distinzione e guardando il tipo di mammiferi sessuati di cui facciamo parte (e non siamo ne gonocorismi o ermafroditi!!!)..."" così come in natura non esiste la pedofilia, la sessualità fra individui simili avviene raramente e solo quando c'è una crisi ambientale o mancanza d'individui di sesso opposto... evidente che nello stato naturale questo comportamento non da concepimento, ma delinea solamente lo stato di crisi di una specie!

la mia idea personale delinea un aggravamento nell'essere umano, visto che si ritiene di possedere un'intelligenza superiore a discapito dell'istinto (ovvero, il resto degli animali si possono anche scusare proprio perché seguono l'istinto è non seguono devianze irragionevoli), questi atti diventano una semplice depravazione...

La publication directe ou par voie de reproduction de cette allégation ou de cette imputation est punissable, même si elle est faite sous forme dubitative ou si elle vise une personne ou un corps non expressément nommés, mais dont l'identification est rendue possible par les termes des discours, cris, menaces, écrits ou imprimés, placards ou affiches incriminés.

 As for a TL;DW, its the story of Greece's debt and the film links it with the global financial system, the IMF, the American crisis and the EU system and its failures. It might be borrowing a little from other documentaries that have come out in the last years, but this one has some nice interviews with both Greeks and foreigners.

 I think it's pretty good, although not perfect, especially for someone who hasn't really followed Greece's internal processes until now.

It says that the crisis in Greece has been caused by the Euro zone.

The adoption of the Euro have increased competitiveness for strong economies (in particular Germany) and decreased the smaller ones. It says that the Euro actually advantaged German economy against Greece's one (and others). A guy says that it's like putting Mohammed Ali in the same ring as an average guy. 

That's quite contrary to what you can hear from Germany saying that Greeks are lazy and keep Germany down. It says that Germany basically got it's good health by destroying smaller countries in the EU.

They also say that the EU and the IMF pushed Greece into neo-liberalism like the US did with Argentina, which decreased even more the wealth of the state.

They say that the measures taken by the UE, IMF and ECB can't work, and destroys the Greek economy and level of living. They say they're made to save the banks, not the people. They transferred the debts of the banks on the public treasure.

The centre of Athens have similarities with third-world countries now. In the countries supported by the IMF, there is a decrease in life expectancy. Also, the government uses violence to pass the reforms.

It explains the concept of odious debt, which is when a new regime comes and is cleaned from the debt that the previous regime had (because it didn't benefit the people). That's what the USA did with Irak (but they didn't use the term to avoid other countries to use that).

It then shows how Ecuador proved his debt illegitimate and refused to pay it. They show that it turned good for the country. They say that a part of Greece's debt is illegitimate as well. For instance a guy say that big companies like Siemens bribed officials for a decade to get contracts. Goldman Sachs used old exchange rates between Yen and Euro to make millions. After that, Goldman Sachs was assigned to manage the Greek debt. They say that help from other countries comes with the obligation to continue to buy weapons (they quote Germany and France).

They ask for a audit committee to review publicly the debt and they claim that a big part of it is illegitimate and shouldn't be paid by the people. They say that such an audit must be asked and done by the people because the politicians and parties have benefited from the debt.

They say that Greece have to default on this debt because there's no way it can refund it, and they also say that it would be immoral. They finish by saying that they should free themselves from the IMF and the UE (I found this quite vague, do they mean quit the UE?).

Sorry if it's not that short, I made it while watching it.

*TL;DR:* Greece's debt has been caused because Germany stole its competitiveness. The international institutions push for neo-liberalism which is bad for Greeks. A big part of Greece's debt is illegitimate (bribes and flawed contracts from bigger economies) and a committee should review it to declare that Greek people don't have to pay it.

My favorites are Spaghettieis and Eireis(egg)  but most Eiscafes have a [photographic menu](http://www.eiskarte.info/eiskarte/foto-katalog.html) of their specialties so you should easily find something you like. Finding an Eiscafe is easy as there are usually many in the shopping district(Fußgängerzone) of every city. In the summer it's fun to sit at a table outside, rest your legs and and watch the world walk by while you eat, drink a beer, or enjoy a cup of coffee.

Which brings me to another favorite thing, the shopping district. We have nothing like it here in the US and it's fun even for just a walk. This is where you will find everything you need from electronics supplies to books, shoes or clothes. This pedestrian area is full of bakeries, butcher shops, fish shops, cafes and restaurants. The bakeries are awesome, full of bread, cakes, and pastries that are great for a fast cheap breakfast with tables to sit or stand at while you eat. One of my simple favorites is a Butterbrezel (pretzel with butter). Germans use about a third of the sugar we do so your taste buds may take a bit to adjust. The butcher shops also offer inexpensive lunch specials if you would like to sample the local fare.

Important electronics note: Germany has a 220 volt electrical system so make sure anything you bring that requires electricity has a switch to go from the US standard 110 volts to 220.

&gt;Die Bundesrepublik war 2009 und 2010 plötzlich in der historischen Position, eine Art europäische Hegemonialmacht zu sein.  

Was gäbe das für eine Reaktion, wenn De tatsächlich so eine Rolle für sich in Anspruch nehmen wollte. 

&gt; Deutschland hätte als ""benevolent hegemon"", als gütige Vormacht, agieren können - agieren müssen. Ähnlich wie die USA nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg hätte die Bundesrepublik frühzeitig und großzügig Geld bereitstellen müssen - verbunden mit der Schaffung neuer, mächtiger europäischer Institutionen, inklusive eines neuen Verfassungsvertrags.

&gt;Wir gelten als ""Euro-Nazis"" (so zu lesen in griechischen Tageszeitungen), nicht als gütige Führungsmacht

Wobei dann die europaskeptischen Engländer sofort ihre Lieblingsbefürchtung bestätigt bekommen hätten, das die EU in Wirklichkeit ein getarntes Vierte Reich ist. 

Ebenso würde Frankreich &amp; Sarkozy kaum freiwillig die selbst verliehene ""Führungsrolle"" in der EU abgeben. Der Euro sollte ja schließlich das wiedervereinigte Deutschland zähmen, nicht ermächtigen.

&gt;Oder was man so für seine nationalen Interessen hält: Dass die Bundesregierung darauf besteht, private Gläubiger Griechenlands mit zur Kasse zu bitten, ist reine Symbolpolitik. Ein Schuldenschnitt würde Griechenland überhaupt nicht helfen.

Tatsächlich wird nichts außer einem Schuldenschnitt Griechenland noch helfen können.
Internationale Wirtschaftswissenschaftler und Finanzexperten, darunter [z.B. Kenneth Rogloff](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/rogoff81/English), sind sich einig, das ein Credit Default Event nahezu unvermeidbar ist. Es bleibt nur die Frage, ob 2012 oder 2013, und in welcher Form.  

&gt;Außerdem nimmt die deutsche Regierung in Kauf, dass die Europäische Zentralbank in ernste Bedrängnis kommt. Die Spekulation wird angeheizt, was die Krise weiter verschärft. 

Was die EZB in Bedrägnis bringt, ist das Verlangen der Politiker, mehr und mehr Geld an Griechenland, Irland, und Portugal zu vergeben, trotz angeblicher Unabhängigkeit, finanzieller Unvernunft, und ""No Bail-out"" Klausel. Und was die ""böse Spekulation"" betrifft: die nutzt lediglich die Freiräume, die ihr die Neoliberalen geschaffen haben.  Auch und gerade in der EU. 

&gt;Falls der Euro zerbricht, wird Deutschland am Pranger stehen 

Falls der Euro zerbricht, wird er es tun, weil die Staaten in der Währungsunion wirtschaftlich zu heterogen und finanzpolitisch zu verantwortungslos waren.  Sein Zerbrechen wurde übrigens schon vor Jahren befürchtet, z.B. [vom Harvard-Ökonomen Martin Feldstein](http://www.marketwatch.com/Story/story/print?guid=9C887988-0102-4B87-8CE4-EFFC4B756A3A). Ohne deutsche Alleinschuld, sondern als Resultat einer Fehlkonzeption.

Auch zitierenswert ist eine Rede des britischen Historikers Nial Ferguson vom März 2004, betitelt ""*The End of Europe?*""

&gt;If you add up all the--to use the technical term--unrequited transfers that
Germany has paid through the European budget since its inception, one of the
most striking facts that I can offer you is that the total exceeds the
amount that Germany was asked to pay in reparations after the First World
War. 

&gt;It is more than 132 billion marks, the sum that the Germans in the
1920s insisted would bankrupt them if they paid it. Well, they finally did
pay it. They paid it not as reparations, but as net contributions to the
European budget.

Another interesting place to visit are beer gardens. These are like outdoor bars with tables and benches  that serve food and drink in a very pleasant environment.

The city has lots of green (basically a forest ranging directly into the city center) and many parks, also a lot of lakes and water channels.

You can usually bike to the university from most places where students usually live, which are usually in the south of the city center (Südvorstadt, Reudnitz, Plagwitz).  Your friend could also contact the Studentenwerk from the University for a room. It's usually easier to fetch a room from them, than finding a privately owned place from abroad.

This is a good show inspired by a real gang who ""owned"" the drug business in Rome back in the seventies, it is the closest italian tv has gotten to american serial dramas, unfortunately it is a little hard for you, since most of the characters speak roman (not exactly a dialect, but many words are not used in current italian, it' kind of street slang). If you move to Rome though you will be very popular ! Very entertaining anyway.
2 Commissario Montalbano : if you wish you can call it a ""cop show"", but mostly it's about Sicily and sicilian lifestyle, brilliant acting, unbelievable landscapes and sceneries. Again, same problem here, this time much harder: lots of dialogs are in sicilian, it is based on books written in sicilian. And in this case it is actually a completely different language.
3 Boris: best comedy show ever created in Italy, a very mean depiction of the italian society through the adventures of a television crew.. working on the set of a bad italian tv show. With this you'll laugh, they speak average italian, with the right amount of bad words (you need those ;)), you'll get an idea as to why italian tv and italian society suck that much. This one i recommend. Everything else, forget about it.
To sum it up: try Romanzo Criminale, definitely watch Boris, and if none of this works try Montalbano, but alas i think you'll definitely won't understand a word.",0,1308691071,null,0,true,0,c2139qf,t3_i5ivh,t1_c2139qf,t3_i5ivh,1427270889,8,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,8

If you are looking for 100% standard Italian the safest way is probably to watch foreign films dubbed in Italian, as professional dubbers have no inflection at all and do not use regional variations.

That said here are a few Italian movies I liked:

* Le mine vaganti (fun comedy)
* Non ci resta che piangere (classic with Benigni, but heavy use of Tuscan and Neapolitan dialects)
* Johnny Stecchino (another one with Benigni)

If you want something more 'serious' I also recommend 'La meglio gioventù'. It's 6 hours long, but it's very good.

Over 90% of Hungary's production facilities are said to be in foreign (multi-national companies, mainly) hands. And now there is a democratic (current government got a 2/3 majority and ...) dictatorship (...changed the nation's name and the constitution) with a megalomaniac president (who runs his party alone and is surrounded by opportunists), the liberal intellectuals like to call ""Mini Mussolini"". And this is exactly the same pattern as it was during the cold war: The interests in the country were coming from an imperialistic force from outside of the nation. Many Hungarians say, that the Russians ""owned the country"". And there was a dictatorship of a Hungarian ""elite"", which wanted to have power, make a career, etc.
While the political ideology is different, the pattern, that, what happened at a raw point, is the same.
If we name this pattern an architecture of everyday's life, then it may be easily visible what happened.
Before the elections in 2010 many Hungarians were proudly saying: ""Hungary is Right"" (meaning the political ideology). So, this means, that the majority (all those 2/3 who voted for the right wing populists and right wing christian democrats) is conservative. And there we have it: It all stays as it was before.

true,timoleon,FRNK,Franken,"&gt;Griechenland ist das Mutterland der Demokratie – und der Renaissance und der Aufklärung! 

Die Mutter der Renaissance und Aufklärung?

Die Titel gebühren Italien und Frankreich, in den genannten Zeiträumen war Griechenland von den Osmanen besetzt und konnte mit Mühe die eigene Kultur bewahren. 

&gt;Einige der heutigen Spitzenkräfte in Athen mögen korrupt sein, aber ihre Urahnen und ihre Geschichte verdienen Respekt.

Das Geld bekommen aber die korrupten, nicht Homer, Euripides, oder Sophokles.

&gt;Keine andere Nation in Europa ist angesichts der Geschichte des 20. Jahrhunderts stärker darauf angewiesen, nicht isoliert dazustehen, sich auch selber nicht zu isolieren.

Wieder und wieder als Universalbegründung den Adolf auspacken wird nach 75 Jahren langsam unglaubwürdig. Die Welt ist nicht 1945 stehen geblieben. 

&gt;Von 1950 bis 2050 wird der europäische Anteil (einschließlich ganz Russlands) an der Wertschöpfung der Menschheit (globales Bruttoinlandsprodukt) von über 30 Prozent auf unter 10 Prozent sinken. 

&gt;Zudem sind wir der einzige Kontinent, dessen Bevölkerung nicht nur altert, sondern auch schrumpft. Am Ende dieses Jahrhunderts werden wir Europäer nur noch fünf Prozent der Weltbevölkerung ausmachen. 

Sind das alles Gründe, noch mehr Geld zu verschwenden, wenn in- und ausländische Experten sich einig sind, das Griechenland seine Schulden in voller Höhe nicht bedienen kann? Je länger die Umschuldung verzögert wird, desto höher die Kosten für alle Beteiligten. 

&gt;Deshalb müssen die Nationen und die Staaten Europas zusammenhalten!

Food varies massively and it really depends how often you want to eat foods from brand names you recognise.  If you go for the supermarket branded items and basics like rice, pasta, meat and veg you can live very cheaply.  Your weekly shop will depend on that.

rent: 625€, large (&gt;100m2) 4 bedroom furnished flat on a very nice place of the city.

internet: 48€/month, cable.

heating: ~40€/month in summer (mostly hot water for showering), ~100€/month in winter. it's somewhat usual to have central heating and have it included in your 'community' cost.

electricity: about 70€/month

water: included in our 'community' costs, totaling 73€/month. this goes up or down a few €/month every year, depending on the previous year expenditures.

food: between 100 and 150€ per person/month. depending mostly on how much meat we eat each month.


other costs: 

a glass of beer/wine/coke at a bar: 1-2€.
cup of coffee and some pastry: about 2-3€.
 
eating out: from 5€/person (kebab/gyros/burger/bocadillo) 10-12€ (tapas, day menu) to 40 (a la carte) or more. 

taxi fares vary depending on the time of the day, about 4-5 for a ten minute ride. bus fares come about to 0.60€ if you get a city card.

medical insurance goes from 40 to more than a hundred a month, but most people rely on public healthcare.

private parking: i don't own a car, but it is definitely needed if you do and want to live downtown. i'd say between 70 and 100€ a month, higher the nearer you live from the city center.

true,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Before addressing your points, which I think are inaccurate, I'd like to point out that comparing a series of wars from the most violent century on Earth to a banking and loans crisis is comparing apples and oranges. It just doesn't compute, mate, I really have no idea why you started out on this analogy. 

&gt; If you told someone in 1900 that in 20 years the entire continent would have fought the largest war, people would have laughed at you, saying that the economies of Europe were too interconnected and any nation going to war would be devastated economically.

1900 is only 29 years after the close of the [Franco-Prussian war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War), in which almost a million people killed or injured, and had the French seething with a desire for revenge. You would most certainly would *not* have been laughed at.

&gt; If you told someone in 1920 that in 20 years that Germany would conquer half of Europe, people would have shown you a newspaper showing Germans with a wheelbarrow full of marks to buy bread and told you you're crazy.

Possibly. But Europe was in chaos in the 1920's. There was ethnic cleansing going on all over the continent, Empires collapsed into mutually-antagonistic small nation states, right ring regimes were popping up all over the place. I found a overview for you [here](http://www.the-map-as-history.com/maps/3-history-europe-treaty-versailles.php). It was not the nice, comparatively quiet, time you guys had over in North America.

So yeah, maybe they would call you an idiot... with a small nervous laugh tagged on at the end.

&gt; Ditto in 1960 if you said the Cold War wouldn't turn hot, and in 1980 if you you said the USSR would dissolve and that the EU would be formed and would include the former Soviet satellite states.

The EEC was the forerunner of the EU and already existed in 1980. The Cold War not turning hot was what everyone was hoping for, and the Economic collapse of the Soviet Empire was something governments in the West had been trying to bring about since its inception. In 1980 the Soviet Union was embroiled in a War in Afghanistan, which was at least partly engineered by the CIA to be a drain on Soviet resources.

&gt; My point is that the average European, doesn't matter from which member state, does not want to pay for another country's mistakes, nor will they vote into office a party that will promise to do so.

I'm sorry I don't get it. You try and make the case for peoples predictions or expectations about the future being wrong... and then you follow it up with your own prediction/expectations?

I do however think there's a good argument for constraining freedom of speech, because actually, constraining freedom of speech does not necessarily stop a politician from saying whatever he wants to convey. If Wilders wants to say that everyone with a Muslim background should be deported from the Netherlands, then, however miserable and impossible doing that would be, him conveying that belief is possible and should be possible. I don't think the charges in this trial were about this, the charges were instead about inciting hatred with particular one-liners about tsunamis of Muslims and about ""cleaning the streets from headscarves"" (which obviously has some nasty connotation in Europe). Him being denied to say these things obviously wouldn't stop him from talking about the nastiest possible anti-Muslim regulation that he'd wish to implement.

It's more on the use of language rather than on the meaning of what you're actually saying.

I can give you my personal point of of view, though. 

I don't believe in collective guilt, ever. We can only be guilty as individuals, either for doing something or for not doing something when we should have. Of course there can be collectives hat consist of guilty individuals, but I believe the distinction is important. More on that later.

Anyway, this goes well beyond only the Nazi party. Many more at the very least are responsible for having voted for them. But on the other hand, a sizable share didn't, and voted for the KPD or SPD when they still could. Thankfully, all members of the SPD in the Reichstag that weren't imprisoned yet voted against the Enabling Act, despite of the present SA, while all representatives of the KPD had already been arrested or forced to flee the country. A small number of individuals even risked their lives to actively work against the regime during the dictatorship.  
Many others, however, supported the regime, and all too many were much more involved than what had been necessary. 

What we do have as a collective, IMHO, is a responsibility to keep the memory alive, and to learn from it. Those lessons go beyond just preventing another dictatorship, war, or mass murder by industrialized means. The way I see it, what we can learn from it also holds true on the small scale. Take mobbing, for example. It's ugly, and it only works if we all play our small part in it, and if we don't speak up when we should. This is the responsibility of each individual in a group. Similarly, when we witness something happening that demands intervention but just stand buy and watch, we can't just walk away afterwards and maybe say ""you know, we really should have done something."" No, not ""we"", *you* and *I* should have done something, we're each individually responsible for taking part in something or not doing something when we should have. 

Edit: Another thing, btw., is to understand what we as humans are capable of doing, and how or why we do it. Just think of the Milgram Experiment, or the Standford Prison Experiment. Some call the Nazis ""evil"", but I believe this is wrong. They were humans. I'm not evil, you probably aren't, either, so calling the Nazis evil somehow implies that those lessons don't apply to us.

Does it matter if you get  14 salary cheques a year or 12.  What matters is the amount you get per year, or how much you earn per hour.  Not how often you  get paid.

Someone in Germany would probably get Euro 20 000 per year, and somebody in Greece would get paid Euro 14 000, but it will be paid over 14 months.  Why are you resentful of that.  They do not earn more than you.  Salaries in Greece are very low.

There are a lot of people who work hard and get a small salary.  In Greece salaries are extremely low.   When I worked  there I earned less than EURO 1000 per month. I used to do corporate finance for one of the accounting firms.  In the UK I would be earning about £ 4000 per month.     Yes I got the 14 cheque, but it meant that I earned £14000 per year.  I paid tax as it was automatically subtracted from my earnings.

**Point 2**

Regarding the age of retirement , I misunderstood your argument.  I assumed you were saying that you live longer if you work less or more.  




**Point 3**

I agree.  The Greeks should have been protesting about all  these issues long before now.   
 
  Some of the changes will be beneficial although they may hurt certain special interest groups eg hairdressers, chemists etc.

A lot of Greeks who leave Greece are successful in their new  countries but can not succeed in Greece.   You success in Greece depends on who you know or bribe.  

There is a lot wrong with the country.

**Point 4**

A lot of people in Greece are angry because of the situation.  A lot of people were not responsible for this mess.   And now they have to pay the price - retrenchments, and a drop in salary that was not high to begin with.  They  as a country are accountable for the crimes of a few, and are being punished. 

Yes, it can be argued  that the Greeks should have protested sooner, but I do not know why they did not.  They were complacent.

**Point 5**



Its not sympathy that is required, but rational thinking.   A lot of the measures are necessary and much needed.  

But I do not think that the EU taxpayers should be throwing good money after bad.    i do not think these proposed measures by the IMF will grow the economy or enable Greece to ever repay its debt.

Well, you can imagine how those who hold prejudices against Jews would be very careful in which environment they would voice them, so it's difficult to gauge. There also simply aren't enough Jews in Germany for those prejudices to have enough practical relevance to fester.   Prejudices against the much larger Turkish-German minority are alive and well, but so far we've luckily been spared of the kind of anti-Muslim populist parties that have sprung up elsewhere in Europe.

&gt; If an American brings up Nazis, why not bring up the centuries of human slavery that the U.S. enacted against non-whites?

That's easy, measuring historic injustices against each other is something I just don't want to get into as a German.
