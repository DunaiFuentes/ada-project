Sorry, my humour was highly dependent on context, I said it minutes after the official declaration of the PM on national television.

&gt;How are things in Portugal?

That's a very open-ended question :)

I can give you some very general answer, trying to cover many different sensibilities. When I speak in imperative form it shouldn't be read as ""I support this"", I'm trying to convey the *vox populi*

**Some feel betrayed, the IMF request is seen as a capitulation that should have been avoided no matter what.**

* Of these, some blame the government for the policies in the latest years, they should have reduced public spending more,etc, etc.
* Others the opposition for not approving the latest austerity package, it created the final destabilisation that put an end to the government strategy of pushing on until the EU comes up with something out of fear of the crisis reaching countries tha would need billions and billions more in terms of rescue.
* Others the previous governments, all the way to the one of the current President, or even all the elected government (""During the Estado Novo we didn't owe anything to anyone and had the coffers full of gold! Those were the days, today this is filled with debauchery, corrupt politicians and africans."")
* On this vein, others blame the IMF, the EU and the Jews that are behind the banking system. This week announcement from the banks saying that they would not lend money and that they wanted the IMF gave rise to a sociologically interesting increase in comments mentioned Jews, marranos, etc, etc.
* Others the EU at large since the situation only reached this point to to leniency and outright complicity. Leaving the euro is seen as an option since the policies being promoted are purposely made to simultaneously stifle growth and make it appear as a huge favour.
* Others blame the overall right-wing policies, neo-liberalism, etc. There are signs of a rather marked increase in left-wing (Communist Party, Left Bloc, etc) rhetoric in a much newer generation (the Portuguese Eurovision song is a half-in-jest song that speaks about ""The people marching on, singing against the reaction!"" and a opo hit song speaks about ""One has to study to be a wage-slave"", etc)

** Some say that it should have been done longer ago**

* In an opposite movement there are also some that stress the need for neo-liberal measures and the popularity of the Christian Democrats (to the right of the right-wing part that generally rotates in the government) is also rising. 
* For others immigration is a problem that must be controlled, violence is rising while the natives birth rate is dropping, writing is on the wall, deportation, etc, etc.
* Others simply think that the shock measures that come with the IMF are needed for competitiveness reasons.
* Others submit that the IMF isn't a bogeyman, all's well, it's BAU.

** Some are just still trying to figure out what it means**

* Some think that the measures will only affect ""the lazy"", which are generally public workers, teachers, anyone working for the State
* Others are concerned about the cuts since they are just barely middle-class (which is eroding).
* Others do not really care since they can't imagine being worse of.
* Others are actually concerned about Spain being next. Despite the historical rivalry there is some genuine concern there, which is nice actually.


Apart from this, things are pretty good in Portugal. Sure, the economy is fucked, we're also pretty fucked (and we have ourselves to blame), but the weather is actually improving lately, so that counts for something.

Mobile data is 24ct/MB, but you can also buy packages (**edit: 500 MB** 10 Euros, 5 GB 25 Euros - both are flat rates - if you reach the limit the speed drops to 56kbit/s but you can still use the net). 

If you reach 40 Euros a month they will not bill you any further (they call this ""cost-airbag"" ;)).
You can buy the sim cards at gas stations and stores (lidl, dm, real, jet, staples, promarkt, saturn, media markt, müller, rossmann). 

There is no need for a German bank account, passport or credit card: just buy a card, enter your name and adress on the activation website and you're done. To top up you can use vouchers from the stores above or a german bank account.

Oh, and there won't be any air conditioning -- it would only be useful for a few weeks per year, energy in Germany/Europe is expensive, and buildings typically are well insulated. Hint: Keep the window open over night and close it first thing in the morning after you wake up.

You can tell people that you're there to learn German, and keep replying in German even when they try to switch to English. Keep in mind that it's not just about practicing, it can be quite frustrating to keep up a conversation with somebody who's struggling to express her-/himself in German when the seemingly obvious and simple solution would be to just use English instead.  
It's often easier when you're with a group of Germans, because at least one or two won't be comfortable with English and the conversation will transition to German eventually, especially when you keep switching back to it.

If by any chance of (bad-?) luck you have a BofA account, you can withdraw cash at Deutsche Bank ATMs for a 1% fee -- ask them about the ATM Global Alliance. There may be American banks that have other favorable conditions, like free international withdrawal via credit card.  
Depending on how long you stay, it might also be worth it to get a German bank account so you have an [EC Card](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cash), which is by far the most common cashless payment system in Germany. Most commercial banks offer free accounts for students, another reason why an international student ID card would be a good idea.

Edit: Pro tip: Döner Kebab is *the* perfect meal when you're ~~out drinking~~ experiencing the culture, also try Afri Cola, Club Mate (slogan the latter advertises: ""You get used to it."") and proper bread. YSK that it's illegal for American citizens to buy Cuban products (like most rum consumed in Germany) even for consumption in third countries (I'm [not making this up](http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Documents/ccigar2.pdf)), but we won't tell. Beer bottles almost never are twist-to-open and it will hurt if you try to -- some breweries tested that a couple of years ago but people apparently didn't like it. We're *very* conservative with beer. Ask somebody to show you how to use a lighter to open beer bottles. Also ask somebody to explain the deposit (""Pfand"") system for bottles/cans.

true,Juhdas,flag-eu,,"da du ein entschiedener Verfechter der Kernenergie zu sein scheints, möchte ich gerne auf deine Punkte einmal eingehen:

&gt;Wir vernichten ohne Not auf Milliardenwerte

* Welche Werte werden denn vernichtet? Die wartungskostenintensiven Kraftwerke oder die Brennelemente an sich? Ernsthaft ich würde gerne wissen, wo du die Vernichtung siehts, die nicht im Gegenzug neue Werte schafft, die das zumindest ausgleichen. Ich möchte sogar behaupten, dass größere Werte geschaffen werden. Denke beispielsweise mal an die Flächen die zukünftig für die Energierzeugung genutzt werden müssen - heute teils Wüste oder Brachland wird von einer Sekunde auf die andere Nutzfläche geschaffen. Zumindest die Grundstückseigentümer werden wohl verdienen.

&gt;Wir verzichten auf Milliarden an Steuereinnahmen

* Wir sprechen aktuell von ca. 2 Milliarden € die evtl durch die Brennelementesteuer verloren gehen, denkst du, dass die zukünftigen Formen der Energieerzeugung und -gewinnung steuerfrei sein werden?

&gt; Wir stürzen uns in zusätzliche Schulden

* Das ist nicht zwangsläufig der Fall! Würden beispielsweise die Erzeuger auch für Lagerung und Entsorgung der Überbleibsel zur Kasse gebeten werden und parallel die Kosten für die Umrüstung/Neuentwicklungen tragen, wären keine neuen Schulden nötig!

&gt; Wir riskieren durch überhastetes Handeln die Netzstabilität
  
* Zum Teil ist das sicher korrekt jedoch ist die Netzstabilität vor allem durch unterlassene Investionen in die Infrastruktur in den letzten Jahrzehnten deutlich mehr gefährdet!

&gt; Wir erhöhen die Abhängigkeit unseres Landes von Russland, Nordafrika und Arabien

* Wir leben schon heute in einer globalisierten Welt, in der die Nationalstatten und Regionen immer weiter an Bedeutung verlieren werden. Nimmst du beispielsweise ""Desertec"" als Beispiel für Nordafrika, so sprechen wir über ein internationales Konsortium. Die Abhängigkeit wird sich eher in Richtung der Konzerne verschieben. Da der Atomausstieg auch im Zusammenhang mit einem Ausstieg aus Öl und Kohle innerhalb der nächsten Jahrzehnte gesehen werden muss, wird die Abhängigkeit von Nationalstaaten sicher auch wieder etwas abnehmen.

&gt; Wir vernichten zusätzlich Gas- und Ölreserven, die unsere Kinder dringend brauchen

* Völlig richtig; doch machen wir uns nichts vor - früher oder später wäre es sowieso weg und auf ein paar Jahrzehnte kommt es dann nicht an - evtl. beschleunigt dies sogar die Entwicklung von Alternativen.

&gt; Wir erhöhen den CO2-Ausstoß um Abermillionen Tonnen

* Nicht zwangsläufig! Ich kann jetzt hier keine Gleichung aufstellen, aber auch Kernkraftwerke bzw. die Ernergierzeugung mit Kernkraft haben eine CO2-Bilanz bei der dir die Ohren schlackern. Denke nur an den Uranabbau, Transport, Lagerung, Wiederaufbereitung, Entsorgung etc.

&gt; Wir verschließen die Augen vor den Möglichkeiten und sehen nur Risiken

* Die Möglichkeiten sind sicher noch nicht ausgeschöpft, doch ist vor allem die Bewertung des Risikos etwas sehr individuelles. Wenn nun also die Risiken von einer Mehrheit (ja so funktioniert unsere Demokratie zumindest prinzipiell) als zu groß eingeschätz werden, treten die Möglichkeiten in den Hintergrund.

&gt; Es ist nicht passiert, was die (Sicherheits-)Lage in Deutschland auch nur ansatzweise geändert hat

* Völlig korrekt, jedoch gab es die Bedenken in der Gesellschaft bereits vorher. Diese wurden ignoriert bzw. als nicht mehrheitlich eingeschätz. Bedenke, dass der Ausstieg bereits beschlossen war und im Nachhinein auf ein späteres mögliches Enddatum festgelegt wurde.

&gt; Wir erhöhen grundlos unsere Lebenshaltungskosten

* Eine Behauptung die ich immer wieder lese und höre jedoch noch nie rational begründet bekommen habe. Allein die Subventionen verschiedenster Art für die Energieerzeuger, die derzeit für Kernenergie aufgewendet werden, könnten zukünftig in die alternative Gewinnung und Erzeugung investiert werden. Eine Verteuerung ist nicht zwingend daraus abzuleiten. Hätten die Unternehmen in den letzten Jahren/Jahrzehnten nicht die Infrastruktur dermaßen vernachlässigt, wie sie es nunmal getan haben, würden wir nun auch nicht mit solch hohen Investitionskosten konfrontiert werden, die nun nötig sein werden um das Netz auf die neuen Gegebenheiten anzupassen.

&gt; Wir vertreiben die Industrie, die unseren Wohlstand gebracht hat

* Da muss ich ganz ehrlich sagen, dass ich das nicht verstehe! Welche Industrie wird denn vertrieben? Ist es nicht für jedes Unternehmen in einer Marktwirtschaft unerlässlich sich auch auf ändernde Marktverhältnisse vorzubereiten und einzustellen?

&gt; Wir verschandeln unsere Landschaft mit riesigen Windrädern

* Glücklicherweise ist die Windernergie nicht die einzige Variante zur alternativen Energiegewinnung - und es sei mir erlaubt zu sagen, dass ich mir lieber 100 Windräder als auch nur einen Kühlturm ansehe, aber das mag meinem persönlichen ästhetischen Empfinden liegen.

&gt; Wir häufen tausende Tonnen Sondermüll zusätzlich (Cd-Te, Hg und ähnliches) an

* Über Jahrtausende strahlendes Material erscheint mir da irgendiwe nicht besser! Kompromisse werden genauso nötig sein, wie das Einsehen, dass alles seine Vor- und Nachteile hat. Das Abwegen ist hierbei jedoch ausschlaggebend!

&gt; Die Politik verliert jeden Rest an Glaubwürdigkeit

* HAHA, der war wirklich gut - hast du die letzten Jahre fernab der Zivilisation verbracht? Restglaubwürdigkeit kann eigentlich nur noch bei völlig realitätsfremden Menschen vorhanden gewesen sein. Man denke nur mal an diverse Korruptions- und Parteispendenaffären etc.

&gt; Wir erschaffen eine Gesellschaft, in der diffuse Ängste das Handeln bestimmen

* Ich möchte glauben, dass wir evtl. in der Lage sind eine Gesellschaft zu schaffen, in der der Wille der Mehrheit des Volkes sich auch wieder in der Politik niederschlägt. Ob ich dann im Zweifelsfall mit meiner Meinung zur Mehrheit gehöre oder nicht erscheint mir dennoch erstrebenswerter als die derzeitige Situation, in der Interessen von finanzstarken Interessenten mehr zählen.

&gt; Wir isolieren uns in Europa noch weiter

* Das mag derzeit sicher so aussehen, jedoch sollte man die Außenwirkung und deren Folgen nicht nur negativ sehen. Zum einen sind sicher die politschen Vertreter unser europäischen Nachbarn nicht begeistert, glaubt man jedoch Umfragen unter der Bevölkerug so begrüßen viele diesen Schritt. Desweiteren gibt es auch in Europa bereits Staaten, die schon lange vor dem Unglück in Japan und dem deutschen Ausstieg eine Entscheidung gegen die Kernenergie getroffen haben. Wir mögen uns also von den (beispielsweise) Franzosen entfernen jedoch rücken damit die Schweizer, Österreicher und Italiener wieder näher an uns heran.

true,Juhdas,flag-eu,,"Da hast du mich leider völlig falsch verstanden! Ich möchte weder die Energieversorger enteignen, ihnen die Einnahmequelle zerstören, noch auf Kosten ""sitzen lassen"". 

Es geht mir vielmehr um eine soweit wie möglich gerechte Verteilung der Kosten. Warum sollen deines Erachtens nach die Komsumenten mehrfach zahlen? Warum sollen in diesem Fall alle Bürger des Landes die Entsorgungskosten tragen, wenn es in allen anderen Fällen die Unternehmen übernehmen? Denke beispielsweise an Industrieabfälle anderer Art, mir ist nicht bekannt, dass der Steuerzahler direkt für deren Entosrgung aufkommt.

Die Einnahmequellen werden meines Erachtens auch nicht zerstört sondern lediglich eingeschränkt, und das genau um eine einzige Möglichkeit der Energieerzeugung - nicht mehr und nicht weniger! Gesetzliche Änderungen gibt es regelmäßig und fast immer ist die Wirtschaft davon betroffen, und bisher haben gut geführte Unternehmen auch immer eine Möglichkeit gefunden damit umzugehen oder sogar davon zu profitieren!

Dass es derzeit keine Möglichkeit einer effektiven Lagerung gibt ist ein Versäumnis der Politik - das macht es nicht besser, hat aber mit der aktuellen Situation nichts zu tun! Alternativen wären vorhanden, diese scheitern jedoch zum größten Teil an den finanziellen Aspekten.

Zu den Windmühlen und zusätzlichen Kosten, die du da hineininterpretierst, kann ich nur sagen, dass es doch wohl im Eigeninteresse der Unternehmen sein sollte sich zukunftsfähig aufzustellen. Außerdem gehören Investitionen in neue Maschinen zum wirtschaftlichen Alltag; dafür gibt es ja dann auch so schöne Dinge wie Abschreibungen. Die bisher vorhandenen Kraftwerke, egal welcher Art, wurden ganz bestimmt auch durch die Energieversorger finanziert.

Ich gebe dir natürlich völlig Recht - die Unternehmen werden wohl kaum ihre Reserven angreifen um den Verbraucher zu entlasten, aber kann ich das ernsthaft dem Verbraucher anlasten? Soziale Kompetenz, gesellschaftliche Verantwortung und ähnliches kommen mir dann eher in den Sinn, aber das ist dann ein anderes Thema...

Die Konsequenzen müssen meiner Meinung nach nicht ausschließlich negativ sein. Die höheren Kosten, wenn dem dann so sein sollte, können beispielsweise zu einem geringerem Verbrauch führen, die Entwicklung von energiesparenden Verfahren und Technologien vorantreiben und daran kann ich beim besten Willen nichts negatives finden. Ich denke man darf nicht den Fehler machen alles nur schwarz und weiß zu sehen.

Another interesting prepaid plan is [Simyo](http://www.simyo.de/). Same 9ct/minute, limited to €39/month. The data option (€10, 7.2Mbps max) officially will reduce speed after 1GB/month, but a friend of mine regularly goes over that and never noticed them actually limiting it. Without the data option, they will reduce speed when you hit the €39 limit.  
However, calls to US landlines cost 12ct/minute, 29ct/minute to mobiles. I also think that Simyo uses ePlus's network, but for inhabited areas that's OK.

I think data is especially important since OP has an iPhone, just think of maps and generally looking stuff up.

true,jb2386,null,null,"Hey mate,

I came from Australia and studied in Germany for a year. I just got home 5 weeks ago, so it's all fairly fresh still, so here's my advice:

1. Phone company. It took me about 2 months to get the right one. I finally settled on [blau](http://www.blau.de). They are the only ones I could get a prepaid data plan (I took over my iPhone). The other companies either charge you per MB or 100 kB or want you to go on a 24 month contract (no such thing as a 12 month phone contract there). With blau I could choose a data pack or ""daten-tarif"". They just changed the name of their plans by the look of it, but I had the ""Internet-Flat XL"" which is 9.90 euro for 1GB to be used in 30 days. After that you can still use data, but it'll just be slower. ""Flat"" usually means unlimited, so in this case it's unlimited (i.e. you'll never be charged more than 9.90 euro) but it just gets slow. The site actually just went down for maintenance as I was checking it, but they do have an unlimited plan (I think it's the Flat XXL) which is actually unlimited. Not sure how much. Oh and the good thing is you can do everything online with them, including loading up on new credit. They even let you set it to be automatic. I had it so if I reached 5 euro in credit to put another 20 on automatically. Worked brilliantly.

2. I lived in Konstanz, which is far south-west. Right on the border with Swizterland. So my first big trip was to Berlin, so getting the BahnCard 50 was pretty much free for me because a one way ticket to Berlin was 110 euro or so and the BahnCard 50 costs 120 euro. So a return trip would normally be 220, but buying the BahnCard then the return trip, it became 230. Then the next time I went to Berlin (I went a few times, and also to other parts of Germany) the return trip was 110 euro. Well worth it in my case. Try to estimate how many trips you can guarantee you'll make and see if you'll save money on them or not.

3. My part of Germany was different in weather terms. It was often warmer where I was (up to 30 or 35 in summer, that's Celsius, not sure what that is in Fahrenheit sorry!) To me the Germans always dressed fairly conservatively. In Australia in summer it's common to be in shorts, thongs (flipflops for you) and a loose t-shirt. I noticed in Germany people would still be wearing pants and jeans. In the end, it doesn't matter, take what you might wear normally in summer and you can always buy other stuff there in Germany. Clothes can be cheap there.

4. My biggest regret is not forcing myself to speak German enough. I think someone else mentioned it here, but it really will be about WHO you hang out with. If you're with the ERASMUS people (you'll start to use that as a general term for all exchange people), all you'll be doing is teaching everyone else English or making yours worse (I talked A LOT slower over there and started to use very simple words and stopped using Aussie slang). The best way is to live with Germans, undeniably. If you're using it everyday, you'll get better. Unfortunately I was in student accommodation and got stuck with other foreigners. If I did it again I would have moved out at the first opportunity to live in a private WG with Germans. 

You will find most Germans speak very good English, and yes they do want to practice it. But mate, fuck it, you're not there to help *them* with their English (they'll probably already be very good), you're there to learn German. Just force yourself to speak German. Pretend you don't speak English (though it's hard because they'll know your accent), or pretend to yourself at least that you don't speak English. A big problem I had when I first got there is in a shop I'd ask something in German and immediately get a reply from them in English without so much as a blink. The only way forward is to continue in German.

Also, I recommend finding a tandem partner. You teach them English, they teach you German. It's a great partnership and helps you a lot because you're both in the same position, and because you're both not very good it actually forces you to talk German half the time because they won't be able to understand everything in English.

**TL;DR**

1. Use blau.de

2. Yes if you travel far, often/repeatedly

3. Don't worry about it, you can always buy clothes there if you don't take the right things.

4. Make **German** friends, not ERASMUS friends (or choose them wisely). Live with Germans. Get a German&lt;-&gt;English language tandem partner. Force shop people to reply in German.

The euro is doomed, not because it is a bad currency, but because, in times like these, countries don't want to have a shared currency anymore.

Regarding bandwidth, 384Kbps is half of what a typical YouTube video has (and that's not even HD, which has some 2Mbps), so you'll have to wait for half its duration until it plays. Considering Congstar is T-mobile's discount brand, this is intentional, they could easily be as fast as the others. They also don't have a cost limit for the calls.  
And Blau (most of the other SIMs you can get everywhere use rebranded Blau plans) charges by volume for anything above 100MB/month (Edit: I was wrong about Blau, please disregard.)

Personally, I would refuse to pay the same (or potentially more, in case of Congstar, although they admittedly have the better network) for less features. That rules out Congstar ~~and Blau~~, and leaves us with Fonic and Simyo *and Blau*.  
Fonic's network (O2) is somewhat better than Simyo's (ePlus) and they only charge 9ct/min to US landlines instead of Simyo's 12ct/min. Simyo has twice the transfer volume and apparently doesn't reduce speed if you go above it. I'm not sure if you can get a Fonic SIM in a brick and mortar store (would have to be an O2 store, but I doubt it), you can only get Simyo online, AFAIK.

Edit: We forgot about Vodafone's CallYa, and those are definitely available in Vodafone stores. This gets complicated quickly, though, they have different models. Some plans cost 15ct/minute, others 29ct/call…

It's oversimplified to think euro vs dollar value is directly proportional to the economic problems faced by individual states who use those currenices. If your currency goes down it can be very helpful in times of strife as it makes your country more competitive for both exports and MNCs creating jobs... the latter being a large chunk of many smaller eurozone economies like here in Ireland.

The german attitude that they're bailing us out while ignoring the fact that they're simultaneously screwing us over (at least that's the impression I see in the media, not that vox-pops are statistically significant) is quite unfortunate.

In 1995, my country was the beneficiary of a bailout, but we paid it back in record time (back then), and have since had continous growth. We have lower unemployment than the US, and we are going to grow our economy by 5% this year, with minimum inflation. Oh, also, we did not request a bailout nor did we need one after the 2008 financial crisis. Our currency is stronger than 3 years ago, too.

For years countries from Europe and North America had lectured my country how to do things. When we finally did it a bit differently, we are now in a better position. So, forgive me if I'm a bit judgemental. But it is my opinion that all of the PIIGs countries could've done a lot better with their management. True, Germany is on the line, but it isn't at all the German's fault for what the smaller countries are going through. Germany did not ask Greece to overspend on their olympics. Germany did not ask Spain to give away Real Estate as if it was a freebie. And Germany certainly did not tell Ireland to guarantee 100% of the deposits of the Irish banks.

The issue is that, now that all of these instances of irrational exhuberance are problems, now and only now have they become ""European problems"". But they weren't ""European issues"" back then, were they? What would've Greece said if Germany or Britain asked them to be more fiscally responsible back then? These problems are of a national origin, and now those nationalities want an international solution. It is better to have one, to be sure, but penalties must also be given, and assurances that the bailout will be paid back and that the national conditions that led to the crisis will be remedied. If you find them harsh, I am sure Germany is sorry about it, but there really is no choice. Otherwise, what incentive would countries in the euro zone have to behave properly?

Addition: It just occured to me, fiscal and monteray policy should be employed on matching geographies. The main issue is that you have 25 or more different fiscal policies throughout the region with one single monetary policy. If you want a single currency, you need a single government.

true,bunburya,IREL,Hibernia,"Interesting post. Out of curiosity, where are you from? Canada, Mexico?

Anyway, it seems a bit rich that you complain about how your country was lectured for years on how to do things, back when your economy was doing worse than others, and now that you have a head on other countries you are so quick to lecture them. I guess it just demonstrates that hubris is not confined to European countries, or the US.

Your thinking matches the thinking of many throughout the EU at the moment, but I think it is misguided. At no point during the ""good times"" from 2000-2008 did Germany or the other large nations voice--or at least act on--concerns about the sustainability of Ireland's economic model. They were happy to let Ireland spend away with the EU funds it was receiving, and were happy to let their own banks and property developers partake in the madness that was going on here. And now that the shit has hit the fan, people like you and others are suggesting that we be punished for our (and everybody's) exuberance by harming our chances for economic recovery.

I think that is wrong. But I want to make quite clear why I think it is wrong, because I'm sure I will be misrepresented. It's not because I blame Germany for the mistakes of Ireland, or that I think people should take pity on the smaller countries. It's wrong because it will not help to prevent future crises. A lack of regulation and oversight leads to exuberance, bubbles and ultimately to economic crashes and financial crises. The EU then responds after the fact by punishing the perceived offenders. That solution offers nothing in the way of deterrence and probably only makes it more difficult to recover from such crises. It also harms the European project in the long term. A much better solution would be to work on institutional reform and implementing a robust, uniform system of regulation. Prevent market failures from happening in the first place. And give the EU more powers to enforce good regulatory practices on Member States.

Finally, I should point out that the premise of this discussion--that the EU is ""punishing"" Ireland and Greece for their sins--is not something I agree with. That is to say, I don't believe that's what's happening. Speaking from an Irish perspective, it seems to me that the EU is on our side.

Otherwise, I agree with what you are saying, but, ultimately, it wasn't the German government who sponsored this ""irrational exhuberance"" of Irish banks; it was German private investors and banks. Let them fail. If Germany wants to bail THEM out, then that is a German decision. Germany shouldn't interfere, positively or negatively, in Irish decision. If Ireland decided to, on their own, back their banks 100% at the expense of their people, that is Ireland's problem, not Germany's. If some German investors were benefitted by Ireland's move, that is beside the point.

My point is, you cannot be half a Super Country and half independent. You NEED to be a single government to have a single currency. You cannot have a single currency with multiple governments. You either split off completely, or unite completely, but whatever it is the EU is doing is unsustainable. Note: I am not saying it is either right or wrong, merely unsustainable.

Finally, if there is a problem, it is because somebody sinned. In the case of Greece, I think it is very much the government's fault. In the case of Ireland or Spain, less so. But, in any case, if somebody sinned, that somebody should be punished. What I find wrong is this impulse of governments to shield their banks or Cajas, or whatever from the punishment, and then expect the rest of Europe to share the burden.

So in contrary to the usual dark mood that's also synonymous with harsh Estonia's winters, ice roads bring a sudden flash of light into our daily lives; henceforth, all of a sudden we're expected to accomodate all of our friends, relatives and also their friends who all are coming from the mainland just try out ice roads and well, to booze. The ice roads are somewhat stigmatized by foreigners, though. We had few British coming in to a business meeting few years ago, and since the sea had frozen up to a point where ferries were no longer in schedule, the Brits were forced to use the ice road. And indeed, they took up the challenge. Only problem was that it took them more than 2 hours to cross that 25km strip of ice.

A l'époque où mes deux parents ont souffert de cancer, nous avons tous fait énormément de recherche sur l'alimentation et son influence sur les cancers et autres mutations génétiques.

Etant végétarienne (mais j'adore la viande et en ait longtemps consommé) il est bon de savoir que c'est l'un des produits les plus affectés par les pesticides ainsi que le lait et autres produits laitiers ; ceci a été montré dans nombres d'études. La dernière que j'ai survolé étant une longue étude dans Time magazine l'année dernière citant des sources précises et des 'scientific journals'. Sans compter que qui dit bio, dit souvent (mais pas tout le temps) élevage en plein air et non-industriel. Chose que je soutiens particulièrement après avoir découvert les méthodes totalement inhumaines infligés aux animaux dans l'élevage intensif.

It's not applied to everyone, last I checked, but if you are selected, you cannot opt out.  You may argue whether, upon selection, being limited to the choice between rapescan and ""not flying"" constitutes ""mandatory""

That said, they're by no means the only culprits - the Dutch have been pressing since 2009 to make millimeter wave scanners mandatory in Europe.  Last time I flew through Schiphol in 2010, I was directed to want, told them to get fucked, and was sent through the normal metal detector, so I'm not sure if that ever got anywhere.

Cost of living depends a lot on where you plan to live. Cities like Rome and Milan and the northern part of the country tend to be more expensive. Rental prices can also be crazy in Rome and Milan -if you try to find something near the center-, while elsewhere they are much cheaper. Cities with universities are usually full of apartments for rent -in not so good condition- as they'll be usually rented to students with low expectations of proper care. Prices however won't be so low as there's lot of demand.

Other cities will probably be much cheaper, but it all depends on what kind of location you are looking for.

true,CountVonTroll,null,null,"&gt; Oh right, speaking of languages, is there much of a difference between the various areas of Germany with respect to dialects? The language school is in Munich so I doubt it'll be much of a problem in Konstanz hopefully (as opposed to if I'd gone to Kiel instead).

All language schools will teach the same standard High German. Think of it as the equivalent of BBC English. Everybody who knows German is used to it and will understand it without problems.  
That said, depending on education and whether they're native or not, even those living in cities will often have a regional accent. Note that it's just an accent, usually they don't speak proper dialect, especially not when they're talking with somebody who's not from the region. But in rural areas, they still speak dialect. Neighbouring dialects are usually mutually intelligible, those further apart tend not to be.  
I know dialects in England have, shall we say, a rich variety, and I admit [Scouse can be difficult](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDaTTVR2JXY) to understand, but I suspect it may go even further than that. For example, a friend who grew up near the Dutch border was working at the bar not too long ago, here in Leipzig (which is in Saxony), and embarrassed himself when he replied in English because he didn't even recognize a customer's Saxon dialect as German. A similar thing happened to another friend when we were in Switzerland, but that's admittedly almost a different language. However, the latter technically is part of the Alemannic dialects, and if you look at the map on the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alemannic_German), you may notice the soon familiar shape of a certain lake…  
Bavarian is different from that, and if you go to the far North West near the coast, then you end up with Frisian, which is also spoken in parts of the Netherlands, and a close relative of Old English.

But really, it's not much of a problem. You'd be able to pick up the language soon enough, and not really encounter any problems in everyday life. Not any more than a native speaker from a different area, anyway. :)

&gt; How would the elections tell you? :P

Well, in the West, the Greens currently poll at 25% and the Left polls at 4%. In the East, the Greens are at 14% (which is stellar) and the Left at 20% (which is unusually low.) The Left has its roots in the former East German state party.  
The Reunification was two decades ago, but before that, it *was* a different country with a very different political system for four. Something like that leaves its marks. On the plus side, people aren't religious over here.

&gt; Incidentally, do you think €1950 is much to live on for 3 months?

Definitely not much, not unless you have housing covered separately. You seem to have a talent for picking expensive places. Munich is famously expensive. Well, maybe not *London* expensive, but by German standards, it's at the top. And for smaller cities, Constance is quite expensive as well.

If possible, try to find a temporary room [in a shared flat](http://www.wg-gesucht.de/en/) (the German name for Constance is *Konstanz*. Students from Constance go on exchanges too, so maybe you'll find a good match. This will also give you access to a kitchen, which will save you even more because you can prepare your own food.  
Bread is a proper meal over here, and not comparable to the soft white stuff you're probably used to. Buy it whole so it stays fresh and learn to cut straight with a bread knife (*Brotmesser*), you'll find a cheap one in most supermarkets (no straight edge, looks more like the edge of a saw.)

What you are describing will be very difficult. Without a work or family visa, you will have to go through a bureaucratic nightmare, proving financial stability, etc.  Have LOTS of money on hand. 

Having a visa will let you acquire a ""Permesso di soggiorno"" ( a permission to stay), a resident's card , and a ""codice fiscale"" - a type of social security number. Without these documents, you will not be able to rent an apartment, turn on the electricity, gas, phone,  internet or start a bank account.  

Another downside is that working for a US company, you will be paid in dollars. You can do as I did, and have them deposited in a US bank. But then to withdraw money, you need to go to an bancomat (ATM) and you will get charged up the ass on exchange rate, and service charges.

&gt; Hmm, it seems strange the Green and Left parties are even different parties, here in the UK they are mostly the same, but I suppose the ex-soviet socialist parties would be very different to foreign ones.

There are five main political parties in Germany. You can think of the CDU as the Tories, the Social Democrats (SPD) as Labour (including the transition to ""New Labour""), and the FDP as somewhat related to your Liberals. We even ~~suffer under~~ have a conservative/liberal government coalition. The Left takes the whole Socialism thing much more seriously than modern mainstream Labour/Social Democratic parties do anywhere in Europe, and forming a coalition with them in a Western state, or even on the federal level for that matter, would be political suicide. However, there *are* states in the East where the SPD has formed coalitions with the Left as the junior partner. The Greens, on the other hand, have practically become a part of the establishment since the pragmatic/realpolitik wing permanently won over the idealist/fundamentalist wing at some time in the early 90's -- Baden-Württemberg is one of our two most conservative states, together with Bavaria, and the Greens just won a quarter of the vote and formed a coalition with the slightly weaker Social Democrats.

A couple of points to help you, some have been pointed out before:

1. You must learn Italian - Italy has the 2nd lowest level of English in Europe.  Anything you have to do outside of tourist crap requires Italian.

2.  Make friends - in general Italians are hypersocial and appreciated people and friendship.  That's a good thing for several reasons, one of which is the fact that the ONLY way to get anything done in Italy is via friends (or friends of friends).  Another of which is that, if you don't have local friends you will probably not ever do anything outside of standard tourist crap.  Plus (again in general) Italians make great friends to have and will enrich your life greatly.

3. Learn what ""L'arte d'arrangiarsi"" means.  Enough said.

4. Get a tourist permesso di soggiorno for 3 months as soon as you arrive.  Use that to get a codice fiscale.  Go to a housing agency and rent an apartment.  Let the permesso di soggiorno expire and don't ever get another one.  NO ONE WILL EVER ASK YOU AGAIN.  As long as you have the codice fiscale, you're good to go. Every time you enter Italy with a US passport - they will never ever even ask you or probably even look up.  They are not looking for rich Americans over staying their permesso di soggiorno.

5. Not paying taxes is par for the course in Italy.  The tax situation in Italy is totally different socially and culturally than it is in the US - don't be the solitary idiot who actually pays them.  Not only will they never catch you as an American - but they will never even have the desire to figure it out.  No one cares.

6. Italian salaries (at least for professionals) are 60% of US salaries, a fact that most people will point out to you constantly - however they also have the things such as the ""tredicesimo"", the ""quatordicesimo"", ""liquidazione"", and a bunch of other payments that narrow the gap (there still is a gap though).  Also, generally you can't just ""fire"" someone in Italy like you can in the US.  Point being - be aware of this - everyone will complain about how little they make, but they won't point out they get a 40k euro liquidazione + 6 months salary payout if/when they quit. 

I love Italy, and as mentioned I lived there for many years and am in fact Italian, however you must have some very strong reason to want to be there (art, food, wine, friends, football, whatever) because you are going to run up against some REAL challenges.  As long as it's worth it, cool.  

And if it doesn't seem worth it - and I say this with all love and respect to Italians and Italy - you're better off moving to Spain.

I decided to bring my car down here as well. It's been great having it here, as we've done loads of travelling, but here's a run down of what you need to know:

 * You can drive in Spain with a UK registered car for 6 months out of every calendar year (so I'm here a year, but only 6 months in 2010 and 2011)

 * To drive legally, the car must be legal to drive in the UK. So you need MOT and road tax (as illogical as that seems). MOT tests can't be done in Spain anymore as far as I'm aware.

 * Insurance is fine. As long as your are over 25 it will be simple enough to get insurance fairly cheaply.

 * If you were to get a Spanish car, I'm fairly certain you can insure it easily enough. UK driving licenses seem to be accepted here.

That's the legal side of things. 

 * Worth having a car here? Definitely. With the heat you'll be wanting to get down to the beach as much as possible. Some other great cities nearby worth visiting (Cordoba, Granada etc) though you could just take buses/trains anyway.

 * If you bring your car, expect it to pick up scratches or bumps (mine got scratched even though it was innocously parallel parked at the side of the road)... Sevillan drivers are pretty impatient, and a much more aggressive than UK ones. Still, driving here isn't exactly hard.

 * Parking in the centre is a bit of an effort. Funny thing: here you find people will double park, but leave the handbrake off so if someone wants to get out they simply roll your car out of the way. 

 * People find it hilarious that my car is RHD. I get funny looks all the time.

There's a decent (but quite expensive) bus route to the airport which leaves fairly regularly and quite frequently from the centre. You can get a month pass for €40/month which is fairly reasonable since it's €4.20 for a return. Near the train station Santa Justa there are some fairly nice and reasonably priced apartments, close to the centre as well. You can get the bus to the airport from there, so that would probably be a good starting point. The bus route takes about 35 mins in total, from the train station only 20mins or so.

I'm not sure how easy it will be to find single person apartments, everyone I know is sharing. With regards to cost, renting on a yearly basis, prices are between €200-270/month more or less (but these prices, and the others I give you are what I know for sharing with 2 or 3 people). You can find some nice places in the centre for €270 or so, with roof terraces etc, which are great for the summer months. Or down at €200 for slightly less nice places out of the way a little bit. There are some more expensive places (€300-350) which will have everything like air conditioning as well (which will probably be necessary July/August) around the centre if you want.

This is a common misunderstanding. Yes, there were individuals on behalf of the state that signed a deal to repay the money the governments of Britan and the Netherlands one sidedly decided to pay their nationals. Therefore we can assume that someone definitely did promise to repay it.

However, something like the Icesave repayment deal can only be ratified by the Icelandic parliament followed by a signature from the President of Iceland. In fact, there was one deal which was ratified but was subsequently rejected by the governments of the Netherlands and Britain. So, again the three nations sat down to negotiate. The other two deals, or promises, which UK and NL were set to accept, were not ratified by the populace of Iceland, and thus you cannot say that there was an accepted promise to repay it.

I've been living near seville for a couple of years now, so welcome to andalucia. It's not as english as the costa del sol but I think it's actually better for it. I'll try and give you some quick info but let me know if you need any more info on anything else.

* I agree with rolmos that movistar sucks, vodafone is ok IMO and orange isn't bad.

* If you decide to get fixed broadband ONO is ok, you could look at Yoigo as well. I moved house alot so I got a mobile broadband provider. You don't need a landline and you can take it with you wherever you. Check out Instanet from Clearwire or vodafone does a mobile wifi service. Speeds are pretty much the same everywhere, so it's pretty much take your pick.

* Lots of english people have shipped their car over. Not sure if it's worth it, depends how attached you are to your car. I found the left hand drive comes fairly easily after a few weeks (though roundabouts are still scary in the other direction) buying a car here can be tricky and Seville has quite a good public transport system. I have my car insured with Linea Directa (Direct Line) they have english speaking operators and you don't have to do anything in spanish.

* It's a buyers market at the moment and there are tons of apartments available. A decent 1 bedroom apartment can be found for between 500 - 600 euros but a lot depends on where you are looking. I can give you some idea of what a neighbourhood is like if you let me know where you're looking.

My main tip would be to get your identification paperwork done as quickly as you can. You need the foreign residents ID (called the NIE) to do a lot of things. The council offices here are really slow, so you may need to take a day off work to go in and sort it out.

I'm originally from the West, but I live in [Leipzig](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig), the city with the highest poverty rate in Germany (at least among large cities.) It's beautiful, and I mean this seriously. It used to be a rich city ever since the Middle Ages, and most of the houses were build a bit over a hundred years ago when the population exploded ten fold with the industrial revolution to half a million. Here's [a graph](http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Leipzig_population.svg), you can clearly make out both world wars and the Reunification, and the recovery over the past decade.

The [center](http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=leipzig+zentrum+OR+innenstadt) is so squeaky clean that many I know don't like it, but my mom loves all those shopping arcades when she comes to visit. Essentially, it's a giant mall, but for something like this it's nicely done and some of the old buildings are [true gems](http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=leipzig+jugendstil). The inner districts have seen a wave of renovation -- our house is almost the only exception in a post-hip, gentrified [neighborhood](http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=leipzig+s%C3%BCdvorstadt) south of the center. Rent around here typically is some €5.50/m^2 ""cold.""

The reason for the cheap rent is that a bit further from the center, prices drop dramatically. There still are many empty apartments in the less desirable districts. The new hip [districts](http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=plagwitz+OR+schleussig), a bit west-south-west of the center on the other side of the park, have almost caught up in rent and currently ~~suffer~~ see gentrification. You'll still find old factory ruins, others have been turned into sterile lofts. It's great, [if that's your kind of thing](http://www.immobilienscout24.de/expose/59835731).

However, unemployment was at 14.1% last June. Much of it is structural, but Leipzig has also become a city many move to after graduation if they can't find a job elsewhere, because if you have to live off the dole, it's probably the best city to do that at. Others come here because it's cheap, there's space, and you can just do your thing, which of course is great for alternative culture. Berlin is *so passé*, you know?

To get out of the city it's just as simple - from my former home it took me only about 40 minutes to get to Poland for example.

Living there is cheap - a fact that shouldn't be underestimated because the payrate in Berlin is much lower than in other citys and places in Germany.

The article is right when it comes to recreational things but seems to miss some points:
for example [""Die Gärten der Welt""](http://www.gruen-berlin.de/parks-gaerten/gaerten-der-welt/ueberblick/) are awesome, the old center [""Dorf-Marzahn""](http://www.berlin.de/ba-marzahn-hellersdorf/verwaltung/natur/dorfmarzahn.html) has it's nice things as well and Marzah could be considered really green compared to other parts of Berlin and most of other German Cities I've ever been to.
But the lack of cafes, restaurants, bars etc. always bothered my friends and me as well... I guess it's simply because of the fact that most people can't afford it and those who can take a ride into the city.

The gains in Iceland's economy were hollow, basically a pyramid scheme, and now the citizens are paying the price.  It is my understanding that pretty much everyone in the country benefited from a grossly overinflated currency, among other things.

I am just extremely disappointed at the way it was handled; the British, Dutch, and Norwegian banking regulators were asleep at the wheel, customers in those countries got greedy, went for unrealistically easy money, and screamed when they got burned, the British invoked a totally inappropriate anti-terrorism law in response to Icesave/Landsbanki's failure, and British and Dutch negotiators refused last-minute at least semi-constructive Icelandic attempts to try and unwind the collapse with a comparative minimum of collateral damage.

I may be a bit of a conspiracy nut here, but I also wonder how much of the aggressive British response was calculated to drive Iceland to its knees, resulting in a nearly inevitable application to join the EU, thus subordinating long-contentious fishery rights to European law and giving the UK better access.  The timing is also suspicious, coming at about the same time as well-publicized banking fuckups in both the UK and Holland.  Just a thought, but I do not like comparatively powerful countries throwing their weight around regardless of the circumstances.

No they didn't. This is a oft-repeated misconception.

The law provides for several things, including anti-terrorism legislation and it also covers the subject of freezing assets. It is under the latter that the Government used the Act to freeze the assets of the UK subsidiaries of the affected Icelandic banks. The freezing order states that they did this in response to an Icelandic law that may disadvantage UK creditors. Seems sensible to me - why allow the failed banks to move assets out of the country when they can be used to help pay UK customers?

Unfortunately people just read the title of the act and assume that it's all about anti-terrorism. Not true.

It is also interesting how you seem to want to blame Britain and the Netherlands for not regulating, and not the Icelandic banks who caused the problem.
