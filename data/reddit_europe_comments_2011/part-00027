When someone accuses another person of having raped her/him, we must presume that:

AND

- the accuser is actually a victim until proven otherwise, which means that he/she allegations must be taken seriously and that he/she must be well taken care of in terms of personal protection, medical and psychological care,...

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Yeah, well, there's nothing that can be done about that now, is there? Yes, we have to learn from this, and yes, countries will have to give up some sovereignty in favor of transparency.  
The euro makes tremendous sense in the core area, going beyond that was a political decision. The European Project isn't just about economics, it's been political ever since the Schuman Declaration ([read it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuman_Declaration) if you haven't yet). People tend to forget that.

Anyway, what do we do now?

One thing we will have to take care of is how the Eurozone itself works, to prevent the next crisis. This will mean giving up more national sovereignty, and it will mean more internal transfers. Learn to accept that, there is no other way. Instead of bitching about it, we should focus on getting it right this time.

But first, we'll have to take care of the current crisis. Ireland, Portugal and Greece have very different problems, and need different solutions. Ireland needs time, Portugal needs help, Greece… well, here's my proposal: 

More budget cuts would be counterproductive in that they would choke off the economy and only hit the wrong people. Throwing more money at it, whether from the outside or by forcing them to sell assets, only delays the inevitable if the underlying problems aren't fixed.  
A default would have unforeseeable consequences for Greece and beyond, and again, if the underlying problems don't get fixed, they'll come back to haunt us eventually.

The way I see it, Greece's problems are the inefficiencies that come with corruption and nepotism. It makes the bureaucracy dysfunctional and lets the rich get away with tax withdrawal.

So, I propose Bruxelles' pin-striped minions take care of business. Make Greece an offer they can't refuse. A €100bn special investment fund, but Bruxelles handles everything. Plus €100bn at zero interest for ten years. In return, Eurocrats get full access to all books and perform random checks. When they come across corruption, the responsible bureaucrat gets fired and loses all benefits. If one bureaucrat rats out on another, s/he gets a premium.

Not realistic, either, but I still like the idea.",0,1306515004,null,0,false,0,c1wcqmc,t3_hlijk,t1_c1wcqmc,t3_hlijk,1427186959,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

true,VomisaCaasi,ESTO,Estonia,"There are various reasons that make up the whole.

1. Most of the Russians don't know Estonia had been a country and even a republic on it's own before the WWII, therefore they think Estonia has always been part of Russia, and as such they don't really understand why Estonia should be given a right to exist.

2. In the Soviet days, more than 300 000 Russians were brought to Estonia in a process called Russification. It's goal was to simply eradicate all the Estonians (also happened to Latvians and so on), our language and simply make us Russians, while our elite (scientists, artists, intellectuals etc.) was deported to Gulag to die. After the fall of S.U, we had about 400 000 Russians living here, which at the time was about 30% of the total. We didn't kick them out, but unless they spoke our language or hadn't already been carrying Estonia's citizenship prior to WWII, they weren't granted Estonia's passports. If they wanted to succeed under the new set of rules, they were finally forced to learn the language. 20 years forwards, and statistics show about 100 000 of them haven't still learned Estonian, hence they aren't rightful citizens (although they can travel freely along the Schengen boarders). Their situation isn't that good (especially for those who happen to live in areas to the East), but for those how actually know the language, we work side by side and we are friends with them. Companies, even the ones owned by Estonians, do not care whether where the worker comes from as long the work gets done. That, however, doesn't mean Russian's living Russia see the situation in such light. They think Russians living in Estonia are being highly discriminated against, and hence, their living conditions should be improved by force from outside. Truth is that Russians living in Estonia are way better off and visas granted to Russian workers from Russia has been rising steadily since the 2000s.

3. During the WWII, after Germans had taken the place from Russians (who in turn took the place from us), most Estonians sided with nazis because we had already seen the full wrath of bolshevik power (first wave of deportation had been carried out), and for us, the nazis seemed like a lesser evil. We didn't know about the nazi concentration camps nor did we have anything against the jews. We just wanted our freedom and Germans promised us independence for fighting with them, while Russians did not. Although WWII ended for Russians when Hitler got what he deserved, but since we had lost our freedom, the war had never really stopped for us, and therefore, we don't really cherish the day when Berlin was conquered in a way Russians do. Thanks to the Kremlin fed media, Russia Today and other channels alike, most Russians to this day think we are nazis and haven't still learned our lesson, and should instead be given one.

Generic advice for Americans of that age group would be Heidelberg (Mark Twain would agree) and Rothenburg. Weimar is a good choice, as it probably has the highest density of historic relevance anywhere in the country. Unfortunately, the Bauhaus Museum is a bit disappointing, IMHO, but Weimar is still a nice destination overall. It's tiny, though, so don't plan too much time for it or you will get bored. Unless you've planned anything specific there, I'd say two days are plenty, three if you visit Buchenwald.

Leipzig is on the way from Weimar to Berlin, and if you left Weimar in the morning it would lend itself to a quick stop on the way to walk around in before you travel onwards in the evening.

You should also consider Hamburg. A tour of the harbor by boat is touristy but worth it.

Frankfurt above the river was very heavily bombed during the war. Some small parts were reconstructed, the immediate area surrounding the town hall (the Roemer), The Paulskirche and the Dom (Cathedral). Only one of the skyscrapers allows visitors to go to the top and that is the Main Tower at 200 metres.

For traditional apple wine, go south of the river to Sachsenhausen. Although there are famous places like Wagner's in Schweizerstrasse, it is often more interesting to find one of the smaller places in Alte-Sachsenhausen with its cobbled streets.

A short drive to the north into the Taunus mountains takes you to the top of Grosse Feldberg which at 800m is the closest point to go for a good view. Nearby is a reconstructed Roman fort, the Saalbau just outside Bad Homburg. If you walk a bit downhill from the top of Grosse Feldberg you can actually find a lot of real Roman ruins as this used to be the ""Limes"" the fortified border of the Roman Empire. Btw, the town of Oberursel has quite a nice museum about the Taunus with much about the Celts (again you can see their earthworks still). Also you have Hessen Park, a large open air museum showing crafts, different building styles and so on.

If you drive to the west, you have Rudesheim in the Rheingau a well known wine making region. Here you take cruises up and down the Rhein. You can even drive up to Lorelei or a bit further to Marksburg, the only castle on the Rhein that was never destroyed.

In Frankfurt, the Alte Oper (Old Opera house) is used now more for special events. Regular concerts, etc take place at the Opern- und Schauspielhaus, in Willy Brandt platz.

For museums and galleries, there are many. For galleries, the Staedel is good for old art, the Schirn is more for temporary exhibitions and the Museum für Moderne Kunst for modern art. I would also mention for museums, the Historisches Museum history of Frankfurt, (it dates back to 1200 or so) Deutsches Film Museum. There is even a museum of old pastic at the Liebieghaus.

If you drive south to Darmstadt, (a half hour's drive or so) you can get to the Burg Frankenstein, which is supposed to be the inspiration for the location in Mary Shelly's novel. If you cary on going south, take the Bergstrasse rather than the Autobahn indirection Heidelberg if you will.

true,mattkerle,null,null,"I Am Not An Expert, but it seems to me that Germany has an economy founded on [manufacturing for export](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/gdp-growth), which makes it one of the strongest economies in the EU. Manufacturing requires energy, lots of it. If they turn off the ~25% of their power that is supplied by Nuclear in the next 9 years, then they will need to grow the rest of their electricity sources by ~30% in the same time just to maintain parity. No small feat.  
  
However, the German economy [grew by 1.5%](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13386113) in the first quarter of 2011, and assuming the economic recovery continues, with energy demands apace, the projected electricity demands of 2020 will be significantly higher than 2011, requiring even more energy production.  
  
Where will this energy shortfall come from? Well, lets look at how [they're currently addressing their 7GW shortfall](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/23/us-germany-power-nuclear-idUSTRE74M4BD20110523). It looks like they're burning more lignite (coal) and importing more electricity from France (which I've read is planning on building more nuke plants but I can't find the link right now). I read elsewhere (but can't find the link now..) that they're also importing more natural gas from Russia.  
  
So, to replace a largely carbon-neutral 7GW, they're burning more fossil fuels, as well as importing electricity that is largely produced from Nuclear power plants just over the border. Their renewable resources would already be running at capacity (you can't make the wind blow harder or the sun shine longer), so there's no spare room there.  
   
Germany in 2010 produced [17% of it's electricity from renewables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_Germany), that's great. However the problem is intermittency, capacity factor and economics. The more [intermittent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_energy_source) your power source is, the more [Operating Reserve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_reserve) you need to follow the load.  
  
If the percent of your supply that's intermittent is small, say &lt;5%, then it's simple to absorb across the grid. but when the intermittent fraction is large, say &gt;30%, then you need significant amounts of reserve in order to ensure smooth supply. This is where [Capacity Factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor) comes in, where for every installed MegaWatt of Wind/PV, you also need some large fraction of high-availability reserve (hydro or Natural Gas) to scale up or down in case the wind stops blowing. In the linked article they work out the CF for a wind farm at 25%, which we can call indicative. PV is harder to estimate because of it's profile, and correlation to peak consumption times, but I would be surprised if it's higher than 30%.  
  
What I'm saying here, is that the shortfall of Nuclear power cannot simply be met by more renewables, it must also include capacity factor, which is usually hydro or nat gas. Smart Grid helps, but when you have wind stalls in winter there won't be much wind/PV spare for sale. So this knee-jerk response to close Nuclear Reactors is very shortsighted, and will either result in:
* importing electricity, likely the majority of which will be coal or Nuclear since Germany already has a lot of renewables and would not need to import during sunny windy times.
* burning more fossil fuels, which will impact it's carbon reduction targets
* energy shortages, eg rolling blackouts. which will likely come in winter when PV production is at it's lowest (although wind tends to pick up in winter which may compensate some)  
  
Therefore, Germany's decision to shut down all of it's Nuke's in 9 years will make an interesting case study for other nations talking about renewables. If they can pull it off without just importing the difference, and do it economically, then that's a great sign for the world that renewables have arrived as a valid option for baseload generation. It will be interesting to see what happens.  
  
I'm not anti-renewables, I think they're a great part of the whole solution. But the problem is that they're expensive, uneconomical, and unreliable. Nuclear is slightly more expensive than coal, but otherwise economical (except for risk and cap costs) and highly reliable (in terms of TeraWatt-hours). The waste is a problem but it can be solved too.

If you could demonstrate operational feasibility (not just pilots) of MSR alternative fuel cycle breeders and their scalability within 40 years I would happily grant them the status of effectively renewable.

&gt; my question to you is, how can renewables (wind/hydro/PV/biomass) provide base load power?

The whole idea of baseload isn't very sensible. Yes, you would have to resort to agile swarm power producers when all renewable is in a worst case situation. Long-term, this needs to be addressed by storage and long-distance distribution, as well as SPS.

See http://www.renewablesinternational.net/yes-we-have-no-base-load/150/537/29353/ for a short discussion of baseload issues in renewable context.

I'm cynical. While undoubtedly a disaster of epic proportion, humanity can afford to lose a region around a nuclear station way more than it can afford the effect of global warming.

&gt;But the real reason nuclear energy is not an option is because it is not renewable, and expensive once all costs are factored in.

There is enough uranium to power humanity for more than a century IIRC. Saving our precious uranium is not exactly as big a priority as saving our oil and coal.

&gt;Which is why we should substitute nonrenewable fossil energy sources with renewable, mostly thin-film photovoltaics as soon as humanly possible, by 2050 latest.

Can you point me to a refutation? I haven't seen a decent one yet...  
  
Also, what renewable, affordable energy scales to 20TW of baseload? I haven't seen one yet, except maybe hydro, and there's no dams to build of that size. 20TW is a lot by anyones reckoning, you're talking about current world electricity production right?  
  
&gt;Nuclear won't scale beyond 1 TW, is not renewable, is not affordable and not safe.  
  
It's only slightly less affordable than coal, and greatly more affordable then wind/PV. Yes burning U-235 is not renewable, we need to be burning Thorium, but that's another debate, and I don't think you'll approve of it either. As to the scalability, the [Westinghouse AP1000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP1000) generates 1.1GWe of power, you'd need 20,000 to power the world. That's a lot, but I invite you to calculate how many wind turbines or square kilometers of PV would be required to equal that feat.  
  
Although, we shouldn't be burning U235 with solid fuels. I'm only in favor of solid-fuel reactors until someone (it will be the Chinese) start producing Thorium molten-salt reactors. Then the renewability issue will be irrelevant for a few thousand years, more than enough time to come up with a more permanent solution.

true, construction costs can be brought down a lot by appropriate regulation and standardisation, but decommissioning costs are still expensive, not to mention the cost of a Fukushima.   
  
Going back to the scenario in Germany, I don't have a problem with retiring reactors reaching the end of their service life, I *do* have a problem with arbitrarily extending that life as Fukushima was due to be after it reached End-Of-Life on March 26 2011 after 40 years of production, and Merkel was due to do prior to Fukushima.  
  
However, I don't think it's a good idea to decide to turn off a large part of a countries energy supply in the political equivalent of a heartbeart, with no plan for later review. By all means, retire and decommission the old reactors, and then build cutting-edge state-of-the-art reactors in their place which are even more resistant to all known accidents ( of which Chernobyl &amp; Fukushima are the worst, Chernobyl being just a nightmare from start-to-finish, and Fukushima being a comedy of errors after surviving a 9.0 earthquake. Germany is not exposed to Tsunamis I don't think..)

In practice, as I understand it, nobody really cares if you come in - as long as you do not use social services.  Hypothetically, you must be either an EU/Schengen resident, in which case you do not require any particular permit, or you must have a Carte de Sejour, which can be a PITA to obtain.

http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/N110.xhtml is a start.

[This](http://www.vie-publique.fr/actualite/panorama/texte-discussion/projet-loi-relatif-immigration-integration-nationalite.html) is the law relating to immigration - have him start having a look through it.

I believe that you need the Carte de Sejour if you are either working and not EU/Schengen, or if you intend to stay for over a year.  This is obtained at the Prefecture.  She'll initially also need a long-stay visa (check with the French embassy) - and must register upon arrival.  [This](http://www.ielanguages.com/cds.html) link has some information about the steps required.  The Carte de Sejour is kind of a pain in the ass to get and takes some time.  Show up early, always.

For care, unless he is paying for it out of pocket, she will need a Carte Vitale.  That is the real kicker.  Private care is definitely doable, but again, would be payable out of pocket.

Exactly.  Malakas, we're printing a shipload full of Euros, and telling Stavros Niarchos to fill them in a boat and take them to the World Bank.  

Of course that's silly.  But at some point, the local mint will have some influence/control over how much physical currency it is able to put into circulation, and, I assume, over the amount of electronic money floating around with its country's name on it as well.

As I responded to NonMaisCaVaPas, if it's a different currency, the markets will cut that country off.  But it's not really a different currency.  

I'm also not aware of any distinguishing marks (beyond serial numbers) on the paper money.  Plus, even if you could easily tell Greek bills apart from the others, one of the whole ideas of the Euro was that national coins (and bills?) would move around the various countries, which is why in any handful of change, you may see coins from 5-6 different countries.  To just say ""we no longer accept Greek bills"" would mean that all Greek Euros in circulation outside of Greece would become valueless - and that would be kind of catastrophic.

- The campouts in sol have been taken over by the usual causes like pro palestinians, pro saharai, 9/11 truthers and other left wingers. nothing to do with the original may 15th movement. so i suspect you´re in for a disapointment. its currently a game of chicken between the local goverment (right wing conservatives) and the central goverment (""left"" wing socialsts) on who has to call the cops to clear them out. 

- Things to do in Madrid ? see the prado and reina sofia museums, which are free saturday and sunday afternoons. see the retiro park which is a kind of central park in central madrid. has the only known statue dedicated to satan in the world. El escorial (its outside madrid but theres a direct train). which is a town around a palace a king made for himself. Also visit chueca which is the gay section of madrid. very livly. 

- how to get around madrid. madrid has bus, train and metro systems. you can get a 7 day tourist pass that will allow you to use all 3. theres also a monthy pass that costs around 47 euros that also allows the use of all 3. and then theres the metrobus which costs 9 euros but only allows uses of buses and metro but not the rail. 

Consider that the transport system is seperated in to zones. this will allow you to use zone A only. further zones get more expencive and will require further passes. but most of that you want or need is in zone A with exception of the escorial and maybe alcala de henares. 

- Where to eat. well you can bum it. a bar of bread usual costs under euro and some ham and cheese to put inside wont cost you much more unless you over do it. as for supermarket brands you should try to go to mercadona. lidl and dia are the cheapest. alcampo and carrefur are ok 
sanchez romero and hipercor should be avoided like the plague price wise (but they have the best stuff).

Eating out i recomend alot you check out bars. alot of bars that look very shitty will allow you to get a decent meal for very cheap. places like el tigre (in chueca) or la blanca paloma (tribunal) will serve very substancial tapas with each drink (but they serve the best ones when you go in a group) but it depends on the bar. some bars you will end up with a small bowl of chips or some olives, its a hit and miss issue. you should avoid eating in the area around sol or in major train stations like atocha or chanmartin, the restorants there usualy have higher prices, even BK there charges 1.5-2 euros more per menu.  you should visit the  san miguel market near sol but AVOID eating there. its a delicatesen place which is considered very expencive so once or twice is great. but as a regular eating place its gonna cost you. 

- as for safty, theres not alot of muggings in central madrid. and you will notice theres normal traffic up to 2-3 am. but there is some so careful about where you hang out. when around the city center keep an eye out for people asking you for directions with maps. its a common scam where one keeps you busy with the map while another picks your pockets and goes through your backpack. so just say you dont know and walk away. 

Most muggings and pick pocketing are done by romanian gypsies. so best avoid them and keep an eye out for them. especialy if you dont look spanish.

1. The airport has special buses that are cheap and take you directly from the airport to Plaça Catalunya (it's the last stop..about 20 mins).  I think they're called Aerobuses, or something like that.  Definitely more economical than a taxi, and really convenient if your hotel is in the center.
2. The metro is awesome.  You can use it to get almost anywhere, but make sure that you keep your belongings within sight (and preferably within grip, too), because pickpocketers are everywhere.  This is also true outside the metro!  I only had a problem once in my four months in BCN, but it's good to be aware.
3. There are some nice areas along the coast near Barcelona.  You can reach Sitges, one of the more popular beach resorts (also known for its gay population), by train in less than an hour, I think.  Girona is also an important and relatively close Catalan city, and has a lot of history.
4. I think so
5. Ahh so many things.  If you like nature, there are a lot of awesome parks.  Definitely visit Montjuic (also has tons of museums and a magic fountains show at night).  Mount Tibidabo has gorgeous view of the city.  Also check out Parc de la Ciutadella.  Puerta del Angel (which comes off of Plaça Catalunya) leads to the old area of the city, and that's a great place to meander around.  There's also a Picasso Museum in that area.  Of course, you'll also want to check out Gaudi's famous works (including Parc Guell) and the beach area.  If you like walking, you can walk straight down the Ramblas from Plaça Catalunya until you reach Port Vell, and then just follow the coast (to your left), which will lead you to Barceloneta and Port Olimpico (beachside areas).

The analysis of why Americans (and Canadians for that matter) don't mind seeing people like this man in cuffs isn't about revenge in my opinion.  It's simply a deeply held principal that no man is above the law, to be treated differently because of his status. It doesn't matter how brilliant you are, how many examinations you passed, your titles and who you know. Commit a crime and you will be arrested and taken away in handcuffs like anybody else would be.

That being said, if it had been some nobody on the street that had committed this crime, chances are the media wouldn't have been very interested in the subject.  The truth is that in North America the rule is: the higher you climb, the harder you fall.  People don't want extra prestige cushions for the elite because everyone knows they already have a lot of money and connections that do this for them.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Ah, I see. Well, in this very hypothetical scenario, there would be some practical limitations. They don't only need the plates and technology, but also the paper and ink. More importantly, they'd have to bring a huge amount into circulation to have a negative effect on the value of the currency -- there were €840 billion in euro bills at the end of last year, several times Greece's GDP. The World Bank, presumably, wouldn't take the bills, as they'd be little more than perfect counterfeits. Or maybe they would, just to call the ECB to ask whether they'd want to use them in order to save printing cost or if the World Bank should just destroy them outright.  
The only way to bring so many bills into circulation would be to hand them out to the population, but this could hardly be done secretly. As jrohila suggested, the electronic flow of currency could be stopped easily, much quicker than such a large amount of cash could be distributed physically, and border checks would be effective against large amounts of cash. So, most of it would remain in the country while the rest of the Eurozone governments might seize the opportunity to force a quick cash exchange for new bills. Not much of a problem for what people have in their wallets and what is in stores, not even for paranoid retirees that have a couple of thousand under their mattresses, but a huge problem for tax withdrawers and organized crime. After a certain deadline, only small amounts could be exchanged at a time, for large amounts you'd have to show its legitimate. Merely suggesting such a plan would undermine faith Greeks would have into the cash in circulation there, and they'd effectively be without currency.

They'd be branded a rogue state and expelled from the EU. I don't think this is technically possible, but as long as there's agreement… Next, there could be economic sanctions. I'm sure there are a few specialized parts that are being produced in Greece and that companies elsewhere rely on, but the economic entanglement isn't exactly symmetrical.

It would be political and economical suicide.

another thing i hear is that parisians are snobs or something, which i think is absolutely ridiculous. but like i said, these people arent from big cities, they are used to smiling and saying hi to people they dont know, and making small talk with people while waiting in line and that type of stuff. i tell them it would be the exact same in new york or something.

funnily enough, they hate the bathrooms here too because they are too small and 2 seperate rooms instead of just 1 room.

true,Gro-Tsen,null,null,"You mean actually *printing* physical paper bills?  This is rather silly: physical currency (or what is more accurately known as the M0 [money supply](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply)) is a rather negligible part of the total aggregate money supply (M2 or M3, essentially held in bank accounts): somewhere around 0.7T€ (tera-euros, or trillion euros if ""trillion"" is taken in the US/small sense of the word) versus around 8.5T€ total (for M2).  Greece would need to print a dreadful number of 500€ bills to make a difference, and it would be a lot of trouble to launder them.

The way money is created in the modern (post-Bretton-Woods) economy is that banks give out loans.  It is a common misconception that money is created by the central bank: the central bank's function is to act as a lender of last resort and to regulate creation of money by fixing key interest rates and reserve requirements.  But ordinary banks create the money: when you borrow money from a bank, the bank does not ""lend"" you money in the sense that it should have it beforehand—it creates it.

So in more relevant terms, your question might be something like: what prevents Greece from finding a corrupt Greek bank and getting it to lend it lots of money (that would then be created).  In legal terms, the answer is that banks are not allowed to create money for the state: at the EU level, this is a provision of the Maastricht treaty, but in every country which adheres to this principle there are plenty of internal regulation mechanisms to ensure this—it is similarly forbidden for the Swiss government to create Swiss francs directly by getting a loan from a Swiss bank, for the United States government to borrow money directly from the Fed, and so on.  There is nothing really specific about the euro, here.  The regulation mechanisms must be credible enough to avoid inflation by the mere fear that the government can influence the central bank or create money in any other way.

As to what would happen if..., well, a major diplomatic scandal would occur, of course, and presumably Greek banks would be cut off from the European exchange mechanisms, making their currency ""Greek euros"" which could no longer be exchanged for bona fide euros, and of course it would be an economic disaster for everyone (Greeks and others).",0,1306848843,null,0,false,0,c1wyv6g,t3_hnn2m,t1_c1wyv6g,t3_hnn2m,1427197600,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

My two favorite ""English language"" websites in regards to European news are [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/) and *[Der Spiegel](http://www.spiegel.de/international/)*. *Der Spiegel* is of course a German language magazine but the website has a pretty substantial English language section. Here are the European sections of both websites:

* [The Guardian – Europe](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe/roundup)
* [Spiegel International – Europe](http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/)

You can also see that *Der Spiegel* has a list of European partners on its website that could be worthwhile checking out. You could also check out the [List of non-English newspapers with English language subsections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_non-English_newspapers_with_English_language_subsections) on Wikipedia.

The European media is in my experience a spectrum of neighbouring countries and countries who speak related languages reporting about each other so I wouldn't be surprised if you were getting better coverage about events in Italy and Spain from the French media than you would get from the German or the British media. 

I also think that Western Europe is also a bit of a bubble when it comes to reporting about Europe as a whole. I hardly see any news from Eastern European countries in Western European media. The Germans talk about the *""Mauer im Kopf""* (The wall in the head) when it comes to the differences between East Germans and West Germans after reunification. Perhaps there is also a similar ""Iron Curtain in the head"" when it comes to East Europeans and West Europeans today.

AFAIK, it depends on your intentions. If you take a photo of the Alexanderplatz it’s more or less impossible to avoid clearly visible random strangers in your shot, but that’s okay.

It gets problematic when you start taking pictures of individual random strangers. But even that shouldn’t be too much of a problem unless you publish them somewhere without asking them first.

Is this correct?",0,1306884350,null,0,false,0,c1x2fnw,t3_hohc5,t1_c1x2fnw,t1_c1x23xt,1427199350,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2
