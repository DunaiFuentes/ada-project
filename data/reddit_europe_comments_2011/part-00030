Pros:

  * people here are kind, IF you approach them politely, they will always help you
  * living in Lithuania is considerably cheap: food, clothing,  cars to some point
  * one of the BEST basketball teams in the world! We call it 2nd religion here.
  * our shore line(Baltic sea) is only 98km, but it's in the UNESCO for it's unique and beautiful looks 
  * you can party all day/night long. pubs/clubs working up to 10 AM :))

Cons:
  * terrible political system. the ideology comes from the times when we were occupied by Soviet Union: if you get elected, steal as much as you can from the country.
  * educational system is fucked up: very little financing comes from government and some studies are really really overpriced. I.E. for social studies (economics, law) your tuition fee is €1160/year, for technical studies it can go up to €7000/year.
  *  too many people drink with no occasions. yes, it's a problem, though maybe not for all

true,blackstar9000,null,null,"&gt; ... doesn't it seem that he meant to refer to the beginning of the abrahamic monotheistic tradition rather than to say that religion began as monotheism?

That would be the charitable interpretation. My interpretation is not so much uncharitable as it is literal. If he had instead said:

&gt; there’s something about religion that is very often, at any rate, in Judaism's original monotheistic form, is ab initio an expression of exclusivism

... that would be a totally different sentence.

As it turns out, the sentence as he spoke it is actually closer to the perspective that he expressed in *God Is Not Great*. There he's quite forceful and specific in arguing that religion as a phenomenon *is* exclusivist. So even granting that his grammatical mangling misrepresented his understanding of Judaism's place in the history of religion, it's entirely likely that his point was that religion is inherently exclusivist. It's still worth wondering how the isolated example of Judaism is germane to that point.

&gt; I read him as saying that Judaism was originally founded on exclusivism and I don't think that's a very debatable point, is it?

I guess that depends on your criteria for exclusivism -- or Judaism, for that matter. What we generally point to as Biblical Judaism was likely the nationalistic codification of religious traditions that were already extant prior to their expression in literature. The exclusivism appears to be the product of that nationalist imperative. So it's highly plausible that there was an identifiably Jewish religious community prior to any doctrines you might call exclusivist.

At the same time, Judaism has never, as far I know, barred entrance into the group to outsiders. It's always been possible to convert to Judaism, so it's palpably less exclusive than other ideological inclinations, like nationalism or racism. Nor is it as exclusive as other religious forms, like the Druze religion, which does not provide for conversion and discourages marriage outside of the Druze group. Nor does Jewish doctrine hold that gentiles are necessarily damned.

If you really want to stretch the point, you could say that there's an element of exclusivism in *any* ideology, since the expression of an ideology differentiates the person who holds it from everyone who holds a competing ideology. But if that's how Hitchens meant the term, it hardly seems worth pointing out, and it's hardly a damning accusation applied to religion.

&gt; it doesn't necessarily invalidate his point that he used an imperfect reference for the sake of expediency

There are no national parties; politicians are only elected by their local constituencies and so they have no incentive at all to compromise. This, coupled with the ever-increasing cultural distance between both ethnicities, has led to a polarisation where it has become impossible to make decisions on the federal level.

The last constitutional elections were held 4 years ago today. Since then, we have effectively not had a functioning government, and it doesn't look like we are going to get one any time soon.

Also today, a new poll was released: separatist countries would get 43% of all Flemish (Dutch-speaking) votes. Meanwhile, French-speaking voters continue to cling onto the idea of a strong Belgian state, and resist further devolution.

I'm not a nationalist who wants Flemish independence for sentimental reasons. But quite frankly, I see no future in cooperation between French- and Dutch-speakers: the federal system does. not. work. And as long as it exists, there will be political tensions. Separation is the only option that can get us out of this mess.

Seventeen year-old Kim is the pride and joy of her father Bryan Mills. Bryan is a retired agent who left the Central Intelligence Agency to be near Kim in California. Kim lives with her mother Lenore and her wealthy stepfather Stuart. Kim manages to convince her reluctant father to allow her to travel to Paris with her friend Amanda. When the girls arrive in Paris they share a cab with a stranger named Peter, and Amanda lets it slip that they are alone in Paris. Using this information an Albanian gang of human traffickers kidnaps the girls. Kim barely has time to call her father and give him information. Her father gets to speak briefly to one of the kidnappers and he promises to kill the kidnappers if they do not let his daughter go free. The kidnapper wishes him ""good luck,"" so Bryan Mills travels to Paris to search for his daughter and her friend

They are casting themselves as such, but don't take their word for it.

A very substantial percentage of their members are over 60 years old, and formerly belonged to the SED, the dictatorial communist party that ruled East Germany. So you will find among them much glorification of their past regime, including the Stasi secret police, and little sympathy for its victims.

Also, the Linke did their utmost to hinder a parliamentary investigation that tried to locate hundreds of millions of former SED funds. These had been secretly transferred abroad, e.g. into an Austrian company called ""Novum"".  

Today, they try to use social justice issues to attract the vote of the poor, unemployed, disadvantaged, and reform-minded. Whether they would, or could, deliver on their campaign promises remains to be seen. 

Much of their party program seems Utopian and more likely to look good on paper than be politically feasible, e.g., dissolving NATO and closing all US military bases in Europe.

http://eurotruth.tripod.com/08.htm

&gt;In the 1999 EU elections UK voters can only vote for one party (with some names on a list).Undemocratic but who cares! 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_the_European_Union
&gt;There is no uniform voting system for the election of MEPs; rather, each member state is **free to choose its own system**, subject to three restrictions:[3]

&gt;    * The system must be a form of proportional representation, under either the party list or single transferable vote system.
&gt;    * The electoral area may be subdivided if this will not generally affect the proportional nature of the voting system.
&gt;    * Any election threshold on the national level must not exceed five percent.[3]

&gt;The United Kingdom divides itself into twelve constituencies, these being the nine regions of England, and the three countries of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Constituencies in Great Britain (which include Gibraltar) use proportional representation from **closed lists using the D'Hondt method**

that happens to be the exact voting method my country uses. Also

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_voting_systems_by_country

quite a few others. If you don't like it (I don't), its your government's choice, not an EU one; complain there.

&gt;European Parliament only has power to ""advise and consult"" the European Commission.

No

Art 14 TEU:

&gt;1 The European Parliament shall, jointly with the Council, exercise **legislative and budgetary functions**. It shall exercise functions of political control and consultation as laid down in the Treaties. It shall **elect the President of the Commission**.

I already quoted to you the procedure re last point; which is why a discussion makes little sense unless you actually address what is said, rather than merely spam exact same links. In short, its analogous to electing a prime minister and a government, but given the upper house is dominant, it has to be accepted by both. Collective censure is still in the hands of the lower house only, as is the execution of the budget (and fairly equal, though somewhat dominant lower house powers in creating the budget) - quite typical powers of a lower house.

Here's a bit on the legal procedure:

Art 294 TFEU: http://euwiki.org/TFEU#Article_294 and a wiki summary http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codecision#Ordinary_legislative_procedure

&gt; The Commission submits a legislative proposal to the Parliament and Council. At the first reading Parliament adopts its position. If the Council approves the Parliament's wording then the act is adopted. If not, it shall adopt its own position and pass it back to Parliament with explanations. The Commission also informs Parliament of its position on the matter. At the second reading, the act is adopted if Parliament approves the Council's text or fails to take a decision. The Parliament may reject the Council's text, leading to a failure of the law, or modify it and pass it back to the Council. The Commission gives its opinion once more. Where the Commission has rejected amendments in its opinion, the Council must act unanimously rather than by majority.[3]

&gt;If, within three months of receiving Parliament's new text the Council approves it, then it is adopted. If it does not then the Council President, with the agreement of the Parliament President, convenes the Conciliation Committee composed of the Council and an equal number of MEPs (with the attendance and moderate of the Commission). The committee draws up a joint text on the basis of the two positions. If within six weeks it fails to agree a common text, then the act has failed. If it succeeds and the committee approves the text, then the Council and Parliament (acting by majority) must then approve said text. If either fails to do so, the act is not adopted.

regarding budgetary control:

here's how a budget is accepted: http://euwiki.org/TFEU#CHAPTER_3_-_THE_UNION.27S_ANNUAL_BUDGET

summarized version from wiki: 
&gt;The EU budget is subject to a form of the ordinary legislative procedure with a single reading giving Parliament power over the entire budget (before 2009, its influence was limited to certain areas) on an equal footing to the Council. If there is a disagreement between them, it is taken to a conciliation committee as it is for legislative proposals. If the joint conciliation text is not approved, the Parliament may adopt it budget definitively.

the relevant paragraphs re that last part of the sentence are:

&gt;5 The Conciliation Committee, which shall be composed of the members of the Council or their representatives and an equal number of members representing the European Parliament, shall have the task of reaching agreement on a joint text, by a qualified majority of the members of the Council or their representatives and by a majority of the representatives of the European Parliament within twenty-one days of its being convened, on the basis of the positions of the European Parliament and the Council. ...

&gt;6 If, within the twenty-one days referred to in paragraph 5, the Conciliation Committee agrees on a joint text, the European Parliament and the Council shall each have a period of fourteen days from the date of that agreement in which to approve the joint text. 

&gt;7 If, within the period of fourteen days referred to in paragraph 6: 

&gt;(d)the European Parliament approves the joint text whilst the Council rejects it, the European Parliament may, within fourteen days from the date of the rejection by the Council and acting by a majority of its component members and three-fifths of the votes cast, decide to confirm all or some of the amendments referred to in paragraph 4(c). Where a European Parliament amendment is not confirmed, the position agreed in the Conciliation Committee on the budget heading which is the subject of the amendment shall be retained. The budget shall be deemed to be definitively adopted on this basis. 

which means the parliament is slightly dominant in this area.

I could continue to quote the procedure for censure, its powers of inquiry but lets move on.

&gt;The European Commission is a permanent unelected body of 17 people appointed by national Governments for 5 years or more.

Once again, I already quoted the procedure for **electing** this 'unelected' body; its a simple falsehood that they are appointend by national government; they only have the power to suggest their candidates (""The Council, by common accord with the President-elect, shall adopt the list of the other persons whom it proposes for appointment as members of the Commission. They shall be selected, on the basis of the suggestions made by Member States,"") and then these, after person-per-person inquiry are subject to vote of confidence. Quite analogous to how governments are chosen in parliamentary systems.


&gt;Such law is secretly made behind closed doors.

As if any government drafts its laws in public. However, once the draft is submitted, as you can see following the legislative procedure description, every step of revisions is documented, and

Art 16 TEU:
&gt;8 The Council shall meet in public when it deliberates and votes on a draft legislative act. To this end, each Council meeting shall be divided into two parts, dealing respectively with deliberations on Union legislative acts and non-legislative activities.

, going forwards:

&gt;The Commission President has a virtual veto over who becomes a Commissioner 

And a prime minister doesn't over who is part of his government?

my thoughts exactly

I won't watch a youtube clip, limited bandwith right now; you could paraphrase and source whatever you say, as is common in discussions though.

&gt; the second that goes into how things have played out,

uff, fine more things for me to read to humor you even though you still haven't engaged any specific points; let's take a look :

&gt; The 2005 Constitutional Treaty made it clear that if the treaty was rejected by any Member State, this would kill of the Constitutional Treaty

... and so it did

&gt;“The Lisbon treaty is substantially the same as the EU Constitution. This shows a lack of democracy in the EU many would argue as it shows the EU is so determined of getting its way it will ignore what the voters have said.

...and so they used the same existing procedure for amending the treaties used for all previous amendments to get the gist of it in, years after the rejection (or do you think if a law was once rejected, nothing analogous to it should **ever** be tabled again? which country works by this rule again?). Procedure, which, I describe below, is hardly undemocratic in comparison to any other constitution-amending process on the planet.

&gt;Also the two most important bodies of the EU: the EU Commission which is appointed; and the Council of Ministers which is elected by their nation states, but not on a collective basis, is not elected by EU citizens. Therefore they’re not democratically accountable, the EU Commission can pass legislation even if EU voters don’t want the legislation, the Council of Ministers the majority of the time can then rubber stamp this

if you wish to argue these points, re legislative procedure, and the election the the Commission, disprove the account I gave of the process of its election, and legislating; otherwise concede that institutions are as democratically elected as governments in any parliamentary system (or in the case of Council, as Bundesrat or French Senate, or Rajya Sabha etc, and makes immediate sense for a structure still substantially intergovermental), and the vote on legislative act is fairly typical in bicameral parliaments.

&gt;Finally there is the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). This is a body which is supranational, meaning it overrides national law. The European Court of Justice is not an elected body,

... and constitutional courts are? Or even should be?

but to be more specific, as typical for constitutional courts, they do need to be democratically legitimated, rather than only professionally:

Art 19 TEU:

&gt;2 The Court of Justice shall consist of **one judge from each Member State**. It shall be assisted by Advocates-General. 

&gt;...They shall be **appointed by common accord of the governments** of the Member States for six years. Retiring Judges and Advocates-General may be reappointed. 

--

&gt;the third focusing on the unelected commission, 

I just gave a point-by-point debunking of each claim in your 3. link; this is the entirety of your reply?

&gt;the fourth discounting your conspiracy labeling nonsense,

you linked amazon.com **book sale** to me; I can't even **see** what you're supposedly saying? What is the argument anyway - that the laws are drafted beyond the public eye - and that's atypical, or worrying? What does that have to do with Bilderberg conspiracies (to which, you'll recall, 'conspiracy theories' referred to); are they mentioned anywhere? If the lone user review posted there is right, it doesn't sound like it, and the authors of the book apparently don't find anything particularly problematic in whatever it is they're describing: ""The authors claim that these undemocratic practices don't matter much, and are no worse than the failings of the member states. "" (and given the tone of the rest of that post, its unclear whether the user or the authors even consider them undemocratic, esp given he repeats 'unelected Comission' I just debunked, without getting any rebuttal - so I'd consider this is something you concede) Or what, exactly? Nor can I offhand see any published review, any data on whether it is a peer-reviewed publication or not? You could give the argument yourself and source your factual claims though. 

&gt;the fifth highlighting the EU Constitution author saying the EU can ignore referendums which is exactly what they've done.

First, your link, which leads to the Telegraph source, gives neither context nor source for its snippets of conversation - but a lot of its own interpretation. So lets see the snippets:

&gt; ""We are **evolving** towards majority voting because if we stay with unanimity, we will do nothing,"" 

&gt; ""It is impossible to function by unanimity with 27 members. This time it's Ireland; the next time it will be somebody else.""

&gt; ""Ireland is one per cent of the EU""


I share his hopes - in which federal democracy is it required for a constitutional amendmend to pass in all states? 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_amendments

&gt; An amendment to the United States Constitution must be ratified by 75% of the state legislatures

note no mention of a referendum; likewise, currently in EU whether a state will hold a referendum or ratify something only in the parliament is the state's business.

&gt;In referendums to amend the constitutions of Australia and Switzerland it is required that a proposal be endorsed not just by an overall majority of the electorate in the nation as a whole, but also by separate majorities in each of a **majority of the states** or cantons.

which is precisely what this 'monster' seems to be hoping EU will **evolve** to do in some future time. Imagine the horror, if it were to be as totalitarian as Switzerland!

In any case, what he is hoping is for now just wishful thinking, the procedure used with the supposedly ignored referendum was Art 48 TEU:

http://euwiki.org/TEU#Article_48

&gt;3 If the European Council, after consulting the European Parliament and the Commission, adopts by a simple majority a decision in favour of examining the proposed amendments, the President of the European Council shall **convene a Convention** composed of representatives of the national Parliaments, of the Heads of State or Government of the Member States, of the European Parliament and of the Commission...

&gt; 4 A conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States shall be convened by the President of the Council for the purpose of determining by **common accord** the amendments to be made to the Treaties. 

&gt;The amendments shall enter into force after being **ratified by all the Member States** in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.


&gt; 5 If, two years after the signature of a treaty amending the Treaties, four fifths of the Member States have ratified it and one or more Member States have encountered difficulties in proceeding with ratification, the matter shall be referred to the European Council. 

... where decisions again require unanimity. Hence unlike the US 75% majority, it needs ratification by all. Whether this requires a referendum is a national matter.

a shorter procedure was added, as follows:

&gt;6 ... The European Council may adopt a decision amending all or part of the provisions of **Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union** relating to the internal policies and action of the Union.  The **European Council shall act by unanimity** after consulting the European Parliament and the Commission ... That decision shall not enter into force **until it is approved by the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.** 

&gt;The decision referred to in the second subparagraph shall **not increase the competences** conferred on the Union in the Treaties.

and a few similar procedures for changing from special (unanimity w/o much parliamentary involvement) to ordinary legislative procedure (the one described in the previous post, in certain areas, with any national parliaments having a deadline to veto rather than procedure of ratification.

this is more interesting:
&gt; ""What was done in the [Lisbon] Treaty, and deliberately, was to mix everything up. If you look for the passages on institutions, they're in different places, on different pages,"" he said.

&gt; ""Someone who wanted to understand how the thing worked could with the Constitutional Treaty, but not with this one."" 

...but which could also be a lamentation over the fact that a clean-sweep constitution was scrapped in favor of amendments to the existing treaties - which are point-for-point diffs to the existing structure of the document. (though imho its fairly readable still; you should try it)

The food market you're referring to I think is [Mercat de la Boqueria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Boqueria), it's just off Las Ramblas (can't miss it when you come here) it's not near Barceloneta, you might have it mistaken.

You can get around with English and a bit of Spanish quite easily around here, but if you have the time to listen, download some podcasts from notesinspanish.com on the topics you find interesting. It will help a fair bit just by listening.

I think nessaj nailed it with the Mercat de la Boqueria.
Have a plate of food at Pinotxo, it's good stuff.

Architecture: since it's your first time, go for the classics.  They're classics for a reason.  Find them in your guidebook, map them out and check them off.

Food: amazing food is everywhere, but after a few of my friends came back with stories of having eaten 'so-so' , I recommend a few of the staples for good tapas: Quimet y Quimet, Cerveceria Catalana, Igueldo, Maitea Taberna, if you can get in: Tickets.

There's a Basque Pintxo place I really like but even after years of visiting I still forget the name; it's in the Barri Gothic and close to a great wine bar which shall also remain nameless thanks to my crappy recall.  You'll know it when you see it, they use the ""grab what you want but keep the skewers"" system and have good cheap txakoli.

There is good food to be had around Barceloneta and also in the Port Olímpic, but I'm hesitant to just recommend going there. If you're a bit savvy though, you should be able to spot the places (usually tent-like and with longish tables you share with whomever) filled with local workers having a lunch. Go there and for about €12 (sometimes bit more/less, it used to be 8(!)) you get three courses of good grub including half a bottle of wine.

For your trip away from Barcelona... lots of good stuff; it depends on what you want and how long you want to travel.  Tarragona or Girona are obvious city destinations, but maybe you want to get away from the city, and then you have the choice of going in-land, through cava country (but there's not much more than that, especially for first time visitors, IMO), north into the mountains or maybe just go to a village on the beach. I'm partial to Cadaqués, but that's not a party town.  If you want to go nuts partying, stay in Barcelona or go to Lloret de Mar or Sitges.  Not sure if those are on full steam already though.

That is way too much text, I'm stopping now.

edit: something I have to add: yes, pickpocketing in BCN is very prevalent and there's no 100% guarantee it won't happen to you.  However, it's not as bad as some sites/people want you to believe.  If you make yourself a slightly more difficult target than the average ""guiri"", you will probably be fine.  Don't be stupid and leave zippers open or your bag hanging from the back of your chair when you're drinking a beer. Also, dress like the Catalans do. Even if you have a camera with you, this will help. Locals have cameras, too.
Be observant and if you find someone walking behind you for too long or too closely, make eye contact. Often they'll laugh and move on.  

Say ""hombre..."" to them while gesturing to them with an open hand, to let them know you think he/she is a clown for even attempting to scout you.  This goes a long way to letting them know you're on the case. Don't be afraid to push someone away if they get uncomfortably close, this unfortunately goes for groups of (gypsy) children, too.

They were set up by the Soviet Military Administration in Germany (SMAD) and run by the Soviet secret service (NKVD). On 8 August 1948, the camps were made subordinate to the Gulag. 

&gt;Because no contacts of the camp inmates to the outside world were permitted, the special camps were also known as Silence camps (German: Schweigelager).  Between 122,000 and more than 150,000 were detained, at least 43,000 of whom did not survive.",0,1307907005,null,0,true,0,c1zacv0,t3_hwp7w,t1_c1zacv0,t1_c1z3zgq,1427238387,2,false,de,t5_22i0,2

true,Fucho,CROA,Croatia,"I'll try to be short, so I'll write just about Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks. First, and most importantly, don't put much weight on oft repeated ""old ethnic hatreds"", because while convenient that view is thoroughly discredited. 

Ethnic tensions emerged in times of crisis in ethnically mixed areas. That is mostly Bosnia and Hercegovina and parts of Croatia. Both have, for a variety of historical reasons, a large native Serb population. 

Now, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (first Yugoslavia) was formed after the First world war but ideologically and intellectually it was based on Yugoslavism developed during the 19th century. As it happened, it was mostly Serb dominated state. Reasons are, initially that Serbia led the unification, being on the side of victorious Antante while Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Hercegovina were parts of collapsed Austria-Hungary. Another reason was that at a time ideal of a stable and strong state was of unitary and homogeneous one, so attempts were made to achieve it on the basis of either Serb or Yugoslav (that never really caught on, and anyway most people outside Serbia didn't really see the difference) identity.

That was one of the causes of underlying ethnic tensions that were horribly expressed during the Second world war. In April 1941. Kingdom was militarily destroyed, parts occupied and parts divided between nationalistic quisling states. On one side, Independent State of Croatia (NDH), protectorate of Italy and Germany, took up a genocidal project directed mostly against Serbs. NDH included large parts of Bosnia and Hercegovina, and the idea was to make an ethnically clean state. On the other side, Serb Chetniks started of as an army of an defeated Kingdom but quickly turned to nationalistic force, doing their own genocide, directed mainly against Croats and Bosniaks in Bosnia and Hercegovina and to the lesser extent in Croatia. To that end, they also turned to collaboration with Germans and Italians.

During the Second world war only the Partisans, communist resistance, presented a option of different nations working together against foreign forces. They got more of the popular support for that, and actively trying to stop ethnic violence where able, than for their communist ideology. Anyway, they took the power at the end of the war and declared a ""national question"" solved as a part of a class question. 

In the socialist Yugoslavia (second Yugoslavia) nationalism was mostly taboo topic. Partly because it was a ""bourgeoisie ideology"" but mostly for the fear of reviving conflicts from the war. As was the case before the war, so after it we can't talk about any large scale popular hatred between nations. However, there were some national extremist, many in emigration that held on to it. Importantly, for many the idea of independent state was closely tied to the idea of ethnically clean one.

Causes behind the break up of Yugoslavia are complex and numerous, but let's just say that the fall of communism made it possible while not causing it. As independent states started to emerge, so did the idea of ethnically clean states. It was relatively easy for extremist in Belgrade to scare the croatian Serbs with memory of NDH era violence. Extremists in Zagreb certainly helped them along, with nationally exclusive speech and policy and a kind of rehabilitation of NDH. What followed was a new war, with new ethnic violence and new ethnic cleansing. 

I guess I didn't manage to be short. But in conclusion, latest conflict was in part fuelled by the memory of previous one. However we must view each through its own causes. Idea of old ethnic hatreds is an easy but ultimately wrong explanation. Before and between above mentioned times of conflicts were longer periods of peaceful coexistence and cooperation. Current animosity, that is rapidly declining I feel, is direct consequence of the last war. I think it will soon decline to insignificance, and I doubt it can be reviewed.

true,VomisaCaasi,ESTO,Estonia,"I guess less problems arise when being publicly gay/lesbian in Germany or especially in Berlin, but you're forgetting the fact that the East, even the ones already in the EU, is not as progressive and tolerant in that sense as you might love to think. Especially in those societies where religion plays a rather great part in peoples lives. I don't really know much about situation in Croatia, so I'm going to give an example how sexual minorities were treated in my own country during the Soviet Union (I'm aware that Yugoslavia, were Croatia belonged to, was merely a satellite state) and why organizing those parades actually is a good idea.

Homosexuality was banned by the law. All sexual acts that didn't involve one man and one woman were considered as abnormal up to a point where those who happened to get caught were put to the same basket with mentally ill, disabled, homeless people and even criminals. All of those groups were hidden from the normal view up to a point gay people faced treatments in hospitals whose main agenda was to cure them. I don't really know how bad sexual minorities had it, but I've heard rumors where, for example, homeless people were used as a live targets by special forces whose only goal was to learn how to kill a man with bare hands as effectively as possible. 

We all know that you can't really ""cure"" a homosexual person and neither could the S.U, but it had a great effect stigmatizing homosexuality in the broader society. Those views didn't change in change 1991. Even in 2011, people still haven't learned to be tolerant against disabled people. You don't see many wheelchairs on the streets of contemporary Tallinn, and even if a Tallinner was confronted with one who could use a hand in something, he or she would at best give a pitiful look at the person and move on in even faster pace without doing nothing to resolve the situation. Homosexuals, however, wanted to change their image and they did it by organizing their first gay parade on the streets of Tallinn in 2004. They were greeted with angry mobs with sticks and fists as we can see from Croatia's example. Fortunately, they didn't stop there and have kept on parading. In that window of 7 years, most Tallinners and even most Estonians have grown pretty tolerant against sexual minorities. You would probably ask why gay pride and not some other measure. Well, if two openly gay persons were to hold hands while walking through Tallinn in 2000, they were given the same looks as did the disabled people in my former example. The difference is that sexual minorities happened to give a considerable outcry towards the overall society through gay parades and nowadays people have learned to tolerate them.

I guess there aren't many problems in contemporary Germany concerning sexual minorities, and eventually those gay prides could get rather annoying, but currently we are not really discussing sexual intolerancy in Berlin, are we?",0,1307959870,null,0,true,0,c1zeea5,t3_hxrt4,t1_c1zeea5,t1_c1zdqsw,1427240285,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

It is my firm conviction that what happens in the bedroom (or the kitchen/the living room/... whereever) does not belong in the public.

In no way it is my intention to link homosexuality to pedophily. I know these two are very different thing that have no direct cause/effect mechanics. I am just using this rather frowned-upon sexual orientation to make a point.

In Cannes : mmm it's a very club-oriented city.
If you are ok for something not typically french, here are some names :

If you want to taste something from Antilles (French Caribbean) there is a ""rhumerie"" named ""Coco Loco"". You can eat spicy food, and also drink unlimited amount of rhum cocktails for 10€ and have a very nice night here.

If you want a good ice-cream, go to ""Vilfeu Glacier"", near the Church named ""Église Notre Dame de Bon Voyage"" and close to Palais des festivals.

There is a nice Irish Pub named ""Morrison's"" (Le Morrison in french :P), not so far from Coco Loco.

There is a traditional Japanese restaurant, ""Le Tokyo"" (~35€ each), which is quite good, and ""L'escale de Chine"" (a Chinese one), very good too.


If you can go to Nice (bigger city) the city center (""le vieux Nice"", the old Nice) is full of restaurants, pub, bars, and Fenocchio makes the best of all ice-creams. You will also find some nice museums (about Matisse, Chagall...), and the Russian Orthodox Cathedral is gorgeous. If you want to avoid pubs full of people, seek for ""The big ben"" which is more traditional and a bit isolated (not directly in the old city but easily reachable by walking)

If you can go to Antibes, you can visit the beautiful Absinthe Bar in the old town, where you can learn about and drink absinthe like people did in the past.

Near Grasse you can go to Caussols plateau, a large open plateau great to enjoy sun and shady walks in pine trees (and maybe to discover hidden caves ?). And by night the absolute pure sky, without any light pollution, makes Caussols the perfect place to observe stars and the milky way (sky is so good there is an observatory there).

In 2008 the combined military spending of the European Union member states was $406,7 billion. In the same time USA spend $620.5 billion. Now compare these two figures to DoD estimates of $63.0 billion that China and $70.0 billion that of Russia spent.


If Europe would combine all their armed forces into a single force under guidance of the EU in the same way as the USA has done, EU would have nearly comparable army to the USA, challenging its hegemony in the European area of interest. Now if the European states would spend even more and again have a single military, Europe would have a comparable force in comparison of the USA.
 

So if Europe is already spending enough on defence, why isn't Gates and Kagan lobbying for Europe to integrate its armed forces into a single entity? The answer is simple, they don't want to. They don't want to because the USA has in clear terms made it public that it will not allow any state to challenge its leading power position in the world. That includes also Europe.

I am not sure that Kagan had an agenda when he wrote his book, he's an historian after all. Gates certainly has one however, and I think you are right.

So again why join something that is becoming a burden when there is a lucrative alternative going to be born.


And in the case of Russian, I really don't think that they have anything against the EU having collective defence. Yes, previously they had very large problems on understanding that other Europeans are very serious about the union, but now they have more or less accepted it and work with it. From the Russian point of view, having an independent EU is a lot better option as it takes the world more into a multipolar globe where there are multiple centres of power.

Arrived at 6ish in the morning, lined up for the blessing at around 7:30, firecrackers went off, ran like hell, slapped a couple bulls as they went by, ran into the plaza del toro, ran around with the bulls (and ran into an old friend from the States who I hadn't seen in years completely randomly).  At this point my balls were feeling extra huge from my encounter with the bulls, so me and my friends relaxed and walked around Pamplona drinking wine and eating food.  In the afternoon we took a bus from Pamplona to San Sebastian in Basque country, this was easily one of the nicest little cities I have even been to, with an awesome beach.  Stayed in a hotel there for a couple nights and then went back to Salamanca.  BOOM, best weekend of my life.

Only the shepards are allowed to direct them. If you go down running don't get up until the bulls are gone cover your neck with both hands to prevent him from stomping on it and roll out of the way when you get a chance. Most deaths are caused when a runner is getting up since the place vital organs at the perfect height for the bull to pierce. After the running of the bulls it fairly (if not free) to go inside the bull fighting rink.

Norwegians value independence/sovereignty quite high. We only became truly independent in 1905, before that we were in a so-called ""union"" with Sweden from 1814 to 1905, and before that we were in a ""union"" with Denmark from 1523 to 1814. This was not an equal union, Norway was basically a colony of Denmark. Before that we were part of the Kalmar Union (1396-1523). The danish/kalmar period is known as the ""400-year-night"". 

Unions doesn't seem to do Norway any good. However, I doubt that people in Norway cares too much about history when they decide whether to say Yes or No, I guess current issues are more important.

Some important issues are the fisheries and agriculture. These areas are not part of the EEA-agreement which Norway has signed, but if we were to join the union we would have to comply with EU regulations. Norway is currently doing a lot to protect the domestic agriculture against foreign competition by using customs barriers. There's several reasons for this, some are food security/disease control and self sustainability. If we were to join the EU our local farmers would have to compete against the rest of the EU, a battle they are sure to lose. Norway would then have to import pretty much all of the food needed to feed the population. Also, we would have no way to control the spread of animal/food diseases. Sea food is a huge industry in Norway, and it's regulated quite well, it seems to be sustainable. If we join the union the fishing quotas would be decided by the EU. The fear is that this will cause overfishing, leading to the decline of the fishing industry in Norway resulting in a huge loss of jobs in rural areas.",0,1308074815,null,0,false,0,c1znw0a,t3_hzbz7,t1_c1znw0a,t1_c1zm9qj,1427244901,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6
