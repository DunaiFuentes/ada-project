true,lockdownit,cinefilo,,"I will shamelessy copy what I posted in another thread regarding italian tourism:

Travelling by train: avoid at all cost Regional trains, because they make a metric fuckton of stops and are usually old, smelly and without a/c. Intercity trains are what you should use if you're on a budget, while eurostar/eurocity/frecciarossa are the best train italy can offer. Usually you can get from big city to big city in 3-4 hours with a couple of stops, the seats are comfy and the a/c is blazing like you're on the kilimanjaro. Be advised, even if the seat is reserved, sometimes people will occupy your seat just because. Politely ask them to leave and usually they do.

Travelling by car: why would you do that. No, i'm jesting. But seriously: cities are hell if you're driving a car, because for italian people behind the weel there are no laws, just suggestion from the government. Be careful whatever you do, and learn to juggle with roundabouts.


As for the food, try to avoid the obvious tourist trap - restaurants on the main street, etc - because they usually sell mediocre food at incredible prices. You can easily live in italy eating snacks (Pizza, Focaccia, Piadine, Panzerotti, Panini...), but should you find yourself desperatly craving italian food, you can surely find some good restaurant.

Even if italy seems like a sunny place in the winter months it's cold. Florence is not that cold but if you plan on visiting the north, you might need some heavy clothes... depending where you are from.",0,1314120182,null,0,false,0,c2em6zi,t3_jreid,t1_c2em6zi,t3_jreid,1427509077,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

true,ohhiasj,null,null,"I think this specific case is probably an error on someones end. I'm sure you can dispute the charge with your credit card company.

However, I think you touched on something deeper; Italians, comparatively, don't treat tourists very well. They have had this sort of quasi protectionist spirit for the last century that has basically bred a generation of terrible businessmen. They are handed a free-ride and make nothing of it. It's heartwrentching when I watch tourists eat and drink at places that know they are providing a shit product at an outrageous price but get away with it because these people don't know better. But these people when making a decision where to vacation next time will almost certainly pick another location like eastern europe.

As for more specifics, Italy has the highest or one of the highest tax rates of any industry nation. Because of this the black market is huge in italy. An everyday Italian will almost certainly engage in black market activity to make ends meet. You can't really do this with tourists, atleast as well. This leads to 1) resentment (however unreasonable) 2) High cost of goods because the government is taking almost half. And those areas where lots of tourists are tend to have quite high cost of living. 

The tax rate was raised recently which is just going to encourage more black market behavior and more of the above. So no, nothing is being done. Although there is a bit of a silver lining, as tourists share their experience through sites like reddit or facebook or blogs businesses have to be more wary of their reputation. I'm already seeing this in restaurants, the patronage of good 'out of the way' restaurants is steadily increasing as tourists become more and more savvy.

true,Lucky75,null,null,"According to the credit card company, $45 is standard for these things in Italy. I'm not sure if I actually believe them, but that's what they said. I will try to dispute the charges though.

Like I said in other responses, yes, it really saddens and bothers me about the treatment of tourists (at least what I experienced). I'm sure I didn't do myself any favours by not speaking fluent Italian and that it's only natural to be annoyed when tourists come in, but I don't think I was rude or anything along those lines at all.

There were several things that really bothered me. One were the people on the street selling things like flowers, bits of string, or bird seed. Every place has that to a certain extent, but I've been to many places in Europe and never have I experienced the pushiness and rudeness that I saw from these people. Sure they need to make a living, but if they need to resort to that then it really speaks about the social situation in Italy. One of my friends was pretty much assaulted (on several occasions) for money, and they actually grabbed her arm hard enough to leave a mark. Police were nearby as were other locals, but no one really seemed to care or was bothered by it. This took place in every city we visited other than maybe Venice.

Another thing is the law about how merchants selling goods on the street are not fined, but tourists are fined instead of purchasing from these people? What that says to me is that Italy as a whole doesn't care about tourists and would rather gouge them more rather than fix a problem existing within the country. I suppose it's a good deterrent, but I don't think it's fair to expect tourists to know that they can be fined for purchasing from merchants on the street.

You mentioned restaurants and tourists eating at crappy places, and that's also a shame since the food can be so wonderful if you eat at the right places, although really that's to be expected and found in any city in the world. Again, though, I've never seen such gouging of tourists with hidden fees and whatnot, even with the french.

It's interesting about the tax situation, thank you for sharing that since I didn't really know some of it. 

It really is a shame that nothing is being done because, like I said, Italy is such a beautiful and interesting country. Many of the people I met were wonderful. However, when such a wide majority of people in tourist areas are involved in such shady and unethical business practices, it really does detract from what would otherwise be a magnificant experience. As it stands, I really don't feel the urge to revisit your country, and nothing really all that bad even happened to me. Rather it's just a sense that tourists are despised or deeply unwanted (except to steal from), which really baffles me since it seems tourism is one of the largest industries.

The thing is, French are bad at speaking foreign languages, most of us are ashamed of doing so.

Do some effort and they will follow :) You might speak to younger people too... EVERY student studies English, youngster should be better at it.

Everything is translated into English in the touristic places in Paris. No worries.

If you don't want to upset locals, never ever assume French are supposed to speak English. When French people go to the US, they don't expect you to speak French... why would they speak English when you come to France?

On another note, don't hug people when you meet them. If it's a guy, shake his hand. If it's a girl, kiss her on both cheek (start with the right one in Paris, the left one in Nice).

In US movies or shows I sometimes hear how someone expects something because they have dated for so or so long. ""This is our third date, that means I have to spread my legs for him"". This doesn't work like that here.

You might date a girl five times before you even get to kiss her, you might get into bed with another (even non-slutty) girl after the first date, or she might decide that she doesn't want to meet you anymore after the third.

You really have to pay attention at the small signals. Her body language, does she suggest follow-up dates, does she linger when you say goodbye at her door after the date, does she laugh a lot (even at your dumber jokes)?

On the ""calling back"" topic: I have had great success with not playing games. That means you text her after the first date to ask if she got home alright and thank her for the nice evening, and you call her back when you feel like it, not days later to show what a busy and dominant male you are. SMSes are your friend here. They are not as intrusive as a call and she can reply whenever she feels like it (and carefully think about what she writes).


BTW: Should I have to mention that *you* pay? ;) If she insists, you insist more. If she still insists, say that she can invite you on your second date. You now have brought up the topic of meeting again in an elegant and nonchalant way.

true,Shockingdiscovery,FINL,Finland,"I think the real mess in the Finland issue may be starting just now that Angela Merkel did not accept the deal Finland had previously made with Greece.

The context here is that Finnish politicians thought that bailing out Greece would not only be a low-risk affair, but would bring in a nice profit for Finland in the long run due to its interest rates for borrowing money from the markets being lower than Greece's.

In any case, the True Finns party, being anti-Europe xenophobes, inadvertedly hit the hammer on the nail when they doubted Greece would be able to repay their loans at all. As it so happened, the debate over the bailout came to a head some two to three weeks before historic elections that changed Finland's political landscape in the arch-conservative True Finn's favor. As they say (somewhere), even a blind chicken will sometimes find his corn.

Finland's national media outlets being A) liberal, leaning left B) heavily biased towards the incumbent's party (pro EU due to hefty agriculture subsidies) and C) funded by the government effectively sold to the voting Finnish public the story that Greek bailouts would be a low-risk affair and ultimately make Finland richer. 

The only caveat attached to getting the bailout through parliament without a political bloodbath came about right after the elections when the current Prime Minister (whose remaining political career may at this point be measured in months) could not for the life of him get a decent coalition together as temperatures were heading upwards of 30 degrees in Helsinki and everyone just wanted to go on summer vacation in their country cottages.

The plan was that Greece would have to supply some sort of collateral guarantee, to which everyone quickly agreed and went off to the sauna. On the street Finns joked whether said collateral would be the Acropolis, or some nice mediterranean islands, which beach loving Finnish tourists would not be categorically against in the slightest.

Fast forward a few months and the politicans return from their well-deserved summer vacations in the country as the Euro is rumored to be on the verge of collapse and the stock market is tanking. Lo and behold, the realization that they may have made a big mistake dawns on these same politicians who originally lobbied for the bailout as they slowly come to understand just in what kind of pickle the global market is in. The more enlightened among them begin to see the distinct possibility of Finland's government loosing a lot of money at the precise time when its business ecosystem is going the way of the dinosaur as Nokia razes operations at home in anticipation of moving the rest of the outfit to China. One imagines that, come next election, the politicians forming the government will be out of a job and True Finn nutjobs firmly in power, if the goverment can make it that far without falling apart on its own.

Now, by rejecting Finland's deal with Greece Merkel is really not giving the politicians any other choice than to withdraw from the whole affair or loose face big time. Finns really don't like to be told by anyone else (who is not Finnish) what or what not to do (see WWII) and ultimately the voting public couldn't give a rat's ass about Germany's wants and needs.

Much fun will be had. Cheers.

No, don't insist. This can go terribly wrong. Just don't insist on anything. Of course, you treat her on a drink or a meal if the setting allows this, but don't get into a fight about who pays, because you don't want to fight.

The second part of your advise is good ""You can treat me the next time"". Perfect. Next date is already secured. She feels that she is expected to make a move. There's an atmosphere of equality.

The male who pays all the bills is an ageing role model. Some will appreciate it. Actually, all girls will appreciate that you make an effort (and paying for a drink is not that much of an effort), but don't put her on a different level from yourself.

I'm an Eastern-European (EU, but ""black sheep country"") legally living in Germany, right across the border with Switzerland. I'm a freelancer and I have customers in both Switzerland and Germany.

As I see it, you could call it ""from the outside"", it looks like this:
The result of Switzerland's ""reticence"" to foreigners can be seen as better integrated immigrants. This is how I see it. The Turks and Russians I'm a neighbor of in Germany are lasier, louder and filthier (like they don't care about city's cleanliness) than immigrants in Switzerland. They don't speak the language properly (like me, unfortunately), but (unlike me) they ask for Harz IV, all kinds of social programs and shit. This doesn't work that good in Switzerland, and I love it for this. You come to work and integrate, not to beg. You know what's ahead of you and you should accept it as a given fact, because you went there to improve your life by improving others' (read: work hard), not to improve your life by begging from the state (read: profit from others' work).

So, this being said I think that Switzerland is doing exactly what it should: be selective. Much, much more selective than Germany is, and it will not last long until Germany will see how much it failed on this. Merkel said it herself once. Especially since the population of Switzerland is something like 8 times smaller, it needs to follow its interests and really be tough and selective.

I know quite a lot of very successful people of my nationality in Switzerland that are happy, felt welcomed and are well integrated. Some are even rich. Some had no problem in getting their G permit done and are now living in Germany, but working in Switzerland. Others live there since years, and I've heard absolutely no one complaining about how much of an asshole the Swiss people / state has been to any of them.

Also, may doctors in Switzerland are coming from the country I'm coming from. They are all happy.

Yes, I agree, in my personal Ausländer's opinion, the Swiss are ""colder"" than the Germans, meaning that you can harder make friends with them, you can harder relate to any of them and vice-versa, that you have bigger chances to meet people that despise you just for being a foreigner working there (bigger than in Germany, that is). Yes. However, all this is so hard to notice or to get affected by, that I really don't care about it too much.

Also, Switzerland was not only with Hitler. It was with everybody that wanted to keep its things safe. My country (first allied with Germany, then against it) kept some if its gold in Switzerland. Also, Swiss diplomats helped Eastern European countries a lot during the war. Please don't forget how small Switzerland is... What should have happened? Another Anschluß?

Ah, the way Merz handled the Libyan issue was completely stupid. He was spineless and he let the world see Switzerland the same way, but I think that was an isolated incident.

And NO, absolutely NOT: people in the EU do NOT get along so well. Not now and probably not in another hundred years. My country is part of the EU, but we (and not only us) are considered worse than any other ""old"" member of the EU. They wanted these ""second-hand"" countries just for a market and cheap labor, but they forgot that with that comes crime, too. Now, they (see France, Holland etc) say that we should still wait some more years until really benefiting from what's to benefit from this EU shit. This is not ""getting along well"".

The roses were in Rome, as were the string guys (it was apparently supposed to be some sort of ""good luck charm"").

I'll be honest that I can't remember all the details now about the payphone since it was a few months ago, but it was from a sign on the payphone, something that was ""locked"" in above the phone behind glass/plastic so that people couldn't just change it out at random. I took that to mean that it was meant to be there since these signs I would assume would have to be approved in order to get access to where they were. I suppose it was pretty stupid to trust it regardless, although I assumed that if there were any issues then I could always dispute it with the credit card company. No way I would ever use a debit/bank card for that sort of thing, but that's what credit cards are meant for.

I can't quite remember what subway stop it was, but it was right by the big duomo with all the spires (in the main shopping district) where there is that long street with all the flags of different countries. I saw the phones with those signs all over the place; it wasn't just one phone that had it. It was also in the subway station right there as well.

We were trying to go to Les Invalides and we got off at the Invalides metro station. We got outside but couldn't see it (Crazy if you know which station I am talking about) because of trees. There were magazine stalls to our right, so I walked up to the man behind the counter who was playing with his phone. I said, ""Excusez-moi-"" and he just started yelling in really fast French. I didn't understand any of it, but I caught something about Americans, and he just went back to messing with his phone. I turned around wide-eyed and we just walked forward...

It would have been a bit embarrassing if I had actually had a chance to ask him, but damn was it rude for him to just yell like that.

&gt;-so those ""new"" members did not want to join? the ""old"" forced them?

Oh yes, they did want to join so badly. However, economically and socially they simply weren't ready. Like for example, huge corruption (like it still is), corrupt politicians (like 90% of them), a population that wasn't ready to put some ""civil"" into ""civilization"" etc etc etc I could go on forever, really.

The EU (especially France and Germany) wanted some new markets for their products (Germany) and some cheap labor (mostly France). Probably many other financial advantages, too. This is why they accepted Romania and Bulgaria into the EU (since it's mostly them I was talking about), while the two countries really didn't conform to the real EU Acquis.

Also, they wanted a buffer zone with Russia, Ukraine and Turkey.

&gt;-what would have been an alternative? keep latvia out?

No. Baltic countries are OK, with a very strong Nordic tradition and civilization. East-European / Balkan countries, yes, unfortunately, at least for 10 years or so.

&gt;-Is Serbia forced to be interested in joining the EU?

I don't know. I guess Serbia should think of something completely different right now and take care of their own problems first (see Kosovo and shit).

&gt; Second thing I just can't accept is:

&gt; ""people in the EU do NOT get along so well.""

I might be too pessimistic, but at the peoples' level everything is fine. However, I was talking about the political level, where everything that you see is just facade and rarely anything more than this.

Do you think that Germany (and even Germans) gets along well with Greece (and their way of cheating the EU)? 
Do you think Holland gets along well with Romania (since they said that Romanians have NO RIGHT whatsoever to work in Holland, although we're talking about the EU free labor circulation and shit)?
Do you think Spain gets along well with Romania (since, they too, put new restrictions on Romanian labor)?
Again, do you think Romania is getting along well with Hungary, since Hungary encourages ethnic autonomy in Transylvania?

And I could go on like this forever. I really think that this EU stuff is getting more and more artificial. European peoples are much too individualistic and different in thinking and ways of understanding work! Look at how hard Germany is struggling to keep this shit together! (Well, they are very dependent on inside-EU exports, so if EU is going down, Germany will probably go down too. But not too much, I would guess.)

This is why Switzerland is doing the best thing it can do given the internal and European political scene.

There's also [Vezelay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A9zelay) which was a starting point for the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Burgundy is also famous for its vineyards and if you like French wine you have to go to Chablis and Beaune. There's also lots of castles and many gauls and romans heritage, just like in the whole country. Most of Burgundy is best discovered with a car though, even if there's a few train lines (even TGV from Migennes to Dijon), you won't be able to easily go on sites of interest without renting a car.

* cell phone provider : Really depends on what you're looking for. Bouygues Telecom is likely a bit cheaper than SFR and Orange, at least for smartphones contracts. Most contract are 2 years, but if they are for more than a year, you can break it after 1 year and just pay 1/4th of the remaining charges.
* ISP: Free (the company, free.fr) See [my comment here](http://www.reddit.com/r/paris/comments/jpwa8/best_isp_in_paris/c2ebk45) for more details
* Utilities : It's pretty much a no-brainer, you just have to transfer the previous contract. Electricity is quite cheap.
* Grocery stores : You'll find something open in Paris pretty much 24/7, but it'll cost you. The smaller the store, the higher the prices are, but they tend to have longer hours. Next to my apt, I have one that is open Mon-Sat 8am-9pm and Sun 8-1pm.
* Tips : No. Unless you're satisfied in a restaurant, and even then it's a few euros, not something like 15%

Zwei sinnlose Wochen beim Zoll sind für Spediteur und Auftraggeber vertane Zeit und verlorenes Geld.

&gt;aber beispielsweise falsche Warennummern sind auch ein Armutszeugnis für die Auftraggeber! 

Besondere aufmerksam hast du den Artikel nicht gelesen, oder? 

&gt;Nachdem der Zoll nun doch Warennummern, Hersteller und Ursprungsland aller Gegenstände in der Utensilienbox verlangt,

&gt;Dabei handelt es sich um Warennummern für ebenso wichtige wie teure Gegenstände: Kugelschreiber, Klebestreifen, Holzstäbchen, Fingerlinge, und so weiter.

&gt;Zudem liegen  keine Dokumente vor, nach denen es sich um eine professionelle Ausrüstung handelt. Hier seien besonders mehrere Kugelschreiber, Teppichmesser, Klebstoff, Klebeband und Fingerlinge erwähnt. 

&gt;Da Elena nicht verfügbar ist, kommt ein anderer Dolmetscher: Boris. Er rät mir, eine technische Dokumentation zu beschaffen. Diese könne vieles erklären. Also veranlasse ich das. Per Mailanhang kommen die Infos samt Anschreiben. Doch keiner der Beteiligten versteht den Inhalt. Das kann wohl nur ein Ingenieur.  

Wenn eine böswillige Bürokratie Verstöße finden will, dann findet sie die auch. Siehe oben, oder hier:

&gt;Das Mess-System wird wieder auseinander genommen, weil die die Ursprungsländer Deutschland, Dänemark und Japan. Folglich müssten es unterschiedliche Warennummern sein. Um den Irrsinn komplett zu machen, werden aus deutschen Kabeln dänische – oder doch japanische?

As I see it, it's a tool, or rather an excuse, to cut even more social rights and spendings when the economy is not doing so good. Note that taxing more the rich or the multinationals is out of question. Measures against corruption (we leak public funds like an old cauldron) are not on the table. Also note that they don't limit the debt because that would damage the banks' profits. I'd actually agree on cutting the debt because it's not actually sustainable.

And anyways, what makes me rage is that they didn't even consider touching the constitution (it was outrageous to even think about it! ""It is perfect like it is!"", ""The greatest consensus of our young democracy!""), but for pleasing the markets they do it in a record time.

The Democracy Now movement has been discredited by the mass media but it is pretty much constructive, they have a lot of proposals for changing things and I agree with many of them. 

The political system of our country is sick. It benefits bipartidism, and with it, corruption. So important points for me would be, reforming the voting scheme and putting in place strong measures against corruption. It's also stated in our constitution that matters of national importance should be voted in referendums, but this rule can be bypassed if matters are ""of extreme urgency"" (which is the trick they pull all the time). That should also be changed. That'd be for starters.

This lack of investment on education, investigation, development, etc is wrecking Spain in the long term. How are we ever going to pay our debt back if we lose all our competitiveness?

(Disclosure: I'm andalusian) And about the separatists, well, as a supporter of True Democracy ®, so it'd be pretty cynical to want something other than a referendum. Let the Catalans vote.

The notion of oligarchy carried out by banks and politicians creates a structure which is rotten and resilient to change because it would affect directly those who are in charge.

To some extent, the social state perks offered to the people, in a time when my country was still adapting to new monetary systems (it had just came out of a 40 year dictatorship), affected our growth and excessive insolvable credit, as in every country, fucked up the banks. Now, the new government is the FMI's and EU's lapdog, carrying out so many liberal measures that this country is turning into US, except MUCH much poor.

A combination of Google translate and a decent sized regular Italian- English dictionary should be fine IMO. Not really worth the 150$  
  
Though I'm really in no position to be giving out advice. I'm not bilingual. I know Spanish. But not nearly enough to hold a long-term conversation.  
  
Personally I think the best thing to do is just learn the mind numbing basics. Subject-verb agreement. Noun-adjective agreement. Syntax. Build your vocabulary. Work on verbs one night and nouns the other. Throw in some adj while you're there too : P . That's how I built up my foundation for Spanish.  Oh and make sure you hear the language too. Cannot stress that enough. While my Spanish rivals that of a 3-year-old there is no way I would be where I am if I didn't hear it. (wasn't too hard for me though because 50% of the language spoken in my neighborhood is Spanish  
  
I live in SoCal so it's pretty hard to find people who speak Italian fluently, unlike finding those who speak Spanish. But from everything I've read and everyone I know who speaks more than one language, they all unanimously agree that the best thing to do is to completely immerse yourself in the language. If you know someone who speaks even a little Italian, try making a small conversation with them. If you don't know anyone that speaks it, do what I do and just narrate what you are doing in your life at that moment. I don't know if it will work. But it's my little way of compensating. Oh perhaps getting an Italian movie might help too. [Cinema Paradiso](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095765/) I've watched. I know barely enough Italian to understand like 3% of what they are saying but I am actually enjoying it. NO SUBTITLES THOUGH. I just use the context of the situation. It still doesn't make much sense. I've seen it like 4 times and I still can hardly understand what they're saying. But each time I watch it i hear a bit more. 
  
Actually you know what I just thought of? Maybe if you want we can do a pen-pal esk type thing like they have on that website you just showed me. We just send each other letters, but like, only in Italian. I don't know. At the very least it would build our grammar. And we could have it so at the beginning of each letter we correct the mistakes the other made in their letter. Then we just write about whatever. We might sound like 5-year-olds, but it might help. If you're interested send me a PM. If you don't feel comfortable giving away your address but you still want to do it then send me a message and I'll give you my address first and I'll just get it from the return address on your first letter. Just in case you're worried I'm a bot or some rapist.

And the quip about how sometimes Germans would lack the US specific details for a joke. Maybe we lack the details cause of people like him who shield us from them? How are we gonna learn about them when they think they know what's better for us?  
Example: Homer in New York. Wants something to drink from street vendor. Is offered crap juice and Mountain Dew. In Germany? Krabbensaft und Mineralwasser. Seriously?

There are a million other phrases that will help you, too. But at the same time, don't feel 
overwhelmed. You don't need to be fluent to travel to France, and no one is going to expect you to master the French language in a week. Parisians are very accommodating of people (especially tourists) who only speak English, but as other people have said, they **will** appreciate you going to the effort to speak as much as you can in French.


Once you reach the end of your knowledge, you can say something like ""Desolé (deh-soh-lay), mon français (frahn-say) est (ay) trés (tray) mauvais (maw-vay). Encore en anglais (ahn-glay)? / Parlez-vous (parlay voo) anglais?"" meaning ""Sorry, my French is very bad. Again in English? / Do you speak English?"" 


The other thing you should know is that it's pretty easy to tell that someone is an anglophone by their accent. Don't worry if you make mistakes - they'll know you're not an expert and do their best to bear with you.

This isn't a practical guide per se, but it talks extensively about what it ""feels like"" to live in Paris. I found it to be super-helpful.

http://www.absparis.org/fr/_fileup/telechargements/pdf_telechargements_10.pdf
This is the guide that my exchange school (in Paris) sent me when I was accepted to study there. A lot of the details (like where to buy textbooks, etc) won't apply to you, but there is still a *ton* of useful information in there.

The rest is personal advice:

Cell phone providers: the big two are Orange and SFR. There are other smaller, ""no frills"" providers like Simyo that you can also investigate. Most likely, what you'll want to do is buy a pay-as-you-go SIM card to use with your existing phone. Orange and SFR charge 40-50 cents a minute, Simyo charges 15ish. Just beware - if you have an iPhone from AT&amp;T, you won't be able to put another provider's SIM card in it. If you need to you can get a phone for 10 euros or so.

Grocery stores are everywhere. The major chains are G20 and Franprix, and they're pretty equivalent, as far as I can tell. Of course, you can also buy food from individual shops / outdoor markets.

Tips are almost always (99%) included in the bill. If you feel that your waiter was phenomenally wonderful and is your new favorite person in the world, round the check up to the nearest denomination that you have (i.e. if your bill was 33.50, you can round up to 35 if you want). Say ""c'est bon"" (it's good) as you hand them the money to let them know that you don't expect change.

Cars: You don't need a car. In fact, you don't even want a car. Paris is probably the single most pedestrian friendly city in the world. What you'll want is a Navigo subway pass. Basically, these are cards that you can pre-load with money, and then swipe to get on to the metro.

You can also check out the Velib bike system. Basically, there are bikes in bike racks all around the city. You check one out for 1/2 euros a day (there are also weekly, monthly, and yearly plans) and then pay a small amount per hour until you return it to any other bike rack. Warning: You'll need a credit card with a chip in it to sign up for this system, and American credit cards don't have them.

There are a million other details that I can't think of now. I'll probably come back and edit this post a few times as I start remembering them.

EDIT: Be careful about ordering water in restaurants. If you just order water (*de l'eau*), you'll most likely be brought bottled water (*eau minerale*). By law, all types of eating establishments have to offer free tap water, but you need to know how to ask for it. *Une carafe d'eau* is a pitcher of tap water, and will be free.

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. I'll be living in Paris until May of next year, so if you'd like meet up and grab a beer or whatever, let me know.",0,1314376496,null,0,true,0,c2fdnpc,t3_jtbtk,t1_c2fdnpc,t3_jtbtk,1427522168,2,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,2

But to be fair, you have to be extremely familiar with both languages to make a decent translation and sometimes it’s just impossible.

If you cannot do a direct translation, you have to think of a similar joke that fits the situation, *both* cultural backgrounds an can be lip-synched.

I'm a Lyonnais who lived for a year in the United States (Oregon) as an exchange student a couple years ago. And since then I've hung out with a lot of US exchange students in Lyon, some of them becoming close friends. Overall, they really liked their experience here, for various reasons. Some loved the food, the night life, the human size of the city, the bars, I'm sure you'll find something too.

If you don't mind me asking, where are coming you from? If I'm not mistaken, i remember that Lyon 2 has exchange partnerships with Oregon, California's UC system but I forgot the other universities...

The list of links dclauzel gave you in pretty impressive. I'd like to add a blog though, set up by a US student as well. It'll be a good resources for you as it is written from the perspective of an American:

Otherwise, lots of good advices in this thread. Re your questions on gyms, don't worry you'll find what you need here, gyms are becoming increasingly commons in France. Memberships might be a bit expensives in most, but I think as a student you will be able to access (for a very small additional fee?) the student sport facilities, incl. gyms.

If you need any additional infos on Lyon, feel free to contact me. It's my city, I love it and I love to help other people discover it :)",0,1314400677,null,0,true,0,c2fgv8v,t3_jt5k2,t1_c2fgv8v,t3_jt5k2,1427523750,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

take RER B from CDG (9:00) to Gare du Nord (9:40), then line 2 to Anvers, you are then at the steps of Montmartre and Sacré Coeur (the meeting place with the phone booth in Amelie), the Moulin rouge is near the Blanche station (about 20 min walk from there) if you want.

if you stay on the RER, you can get down at Chatelet (9:44) for a short walk to Notre Dame, or a longer one toward the Louvre and the Tuilleries (i recommand).

or get down at St Michel and change to RER C to get to Champs de Mars for the Eiffel tower.

given the time constraints, i would advize against lining up for sight seeing (like waiting to go up the eiffel tower or other).

my suggestion: [t=0]CDG&lt;RER B&gt;Chatelet-walk for Notre Dame, until St michel [t=2h]&lt;RER C&gt;Champs de Mars- see eiffel tower&lt;subway line 6&gt;Charles de gaulle Etoile [t=3h]-walk down the Champs elisees through the Tuilleries and the Louvres until Chatelet (count a good 1h walk) [t=4.5] then depending on the remaining time, either check Montmartre or go directly back to CDG.

although, i have no idea how long gettig in/out of the airport (customs and all) will take.


http://www.ratp.fr/plan-interactif/carteidf.php?lang=uk

if you use the subway, count 1.5 min per station, if you walk, thats less than 10min per station (ie, if you are not in a hurry, it is easier to walk for a couple of stations)

finally, Paris is nice enough to just get there and enjoy the place without rushing aound. this might also be a good option.",0,1314406129,null,0,true,0,c2fhh4m,t3_jvi7v,t1_c2fhh4m,t3_jvi7v,1427524038,12,false,france,t5_2qhjz,12
