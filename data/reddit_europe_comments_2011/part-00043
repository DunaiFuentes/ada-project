true,Fucho,CROA,Croatia,"That's why this one is a trench.

Walls are not a sustainable solution to anything, especially in the ever more connected world. They are also repugnant, at least as a symptom of the serious problem. 

But, I wouldn't say that they don't work. East German wall did stop the emigration almost completely and avoided the collapse of GDR because of it. It did later collapse but for different reasons, and the opening of the borders in Hungary with the sudden mass movement was than more of a consequence than cause of GDR collapse. American fence is far less effective, but it almost certainly does make illegal crossing harder, therefore more expensive for immigrants (in money and in risk terms) and so very probably does reduce the immigration.

Immigration is a consequence of gross inequalities and it is unlikely to stop while its causes persist. Walls can slow it down, but also more likely to ferment the problem and lead to the more acute manifestations. Still, often invisible inequalities are given a strong symbol in such a wall and I'd say that they are a big ""failure here"" sign.

Oh yeah, but this is a trench. I guess the same applies, and maybe the visibility is the biggest functional difference to the fence or the wall.",0,1312480085,null,0,false,0,c2a4gid,t3_j8ylm,t1_c2a4gid,t1_c2a47x2,1427431131,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

I would also agree with your solution, but I don't have a clue about how it could be achieved. Now, I'm not saying that it is an excuse not to search for an answer, just that I don't have it. We seem to have similar values and judgements about walls and what they do and represent.

I do have to defend my initial post about effectiveness of walls and GDR. Before the wall was put up the rate of emigration from GDR was unsustainable and accelerating. With the wall it almost stopped, what was almost a mass exodus became a trickle of exceptions. 

I don't know if GDR would collapse because of emigration, but Ulbricht was certainly convinced that it would. In fact, he even forced Hruschov to approve it by hinting at closing the borders. That in turn accelerated the emigration to the point where it was really a clear choice between the wall and the collapse. I would think that without the wall, GDR would at least be less stable and maybe collapse sooner. 

All the other repressive measures you mention were in place before and after the wall, and the regime was in the long run unsustainable. But the wall worked in the sense that the collapse was not caused by the emigration, that in fact did almost stop. The whole system was not only ineficiant but also overly repressive and that caused the problem of emigration in the first place. What the wall did do, and do successfully, is stop the emigration. It was in the first place needed because of all the other problems and became a strong symbol of them. The wall worked, the GDR did not.

I guess we are back to the current trench and fences in a way. Like the wall they can't and don't even attempt to solve the main problem - injustice. They ""solve"" the consequence of those injustices, not nearly as successfully as the GDR did, and stay as a symbol of those injustices, but unfortunately all to often ignored.",0,1312485564,null,0,false,0,c2a5atf,t3_j8ylm,t1_c2a5atf,t1_c2a4tl6,1427431528,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Or you can try a small coast town near barcelona. Castelldefels is like 30 minutes by train, and Sitges (quite famous) around 45 minutes.",0,1312497918,null,0,false,0,c2a71h5,t3_j5uxz,t1_c2a71h5,t1_c29tnmj,1428196726,1,false,Barcelona,t5_2qosg,1

it was late and so and I could have been more throrough (naming influence via culture of course). But there is no doubt that all I said refers to real WTO / ACTA / Finance crisis happenings and that I am opposed to it.

As I said, I don't see it as anti-americanism since I have nothing against America itself or its people. It's the bad sides I am opposed to, I guess. I would be equally against other countries behaving this way. It's undemocractic, imperialistic and plain the wrong way to go.#

edit: Don't get me wrong, there are lots of people on this side of the pond who wants us to go in the same direction. As the present demonstrates, this is a very bad idea. I have my doubts about the viability of the European union. Having to seriously reduce debt will be very hard and lead to more and more bailouts of more and more countries, making their economy even worse. And it's not like our tabloids often want to represent it: The people in Greece, Spain and Italy are not lazy fucks bathing in our moneys. They large majority already suffers heaps for the benefit of a very limited, very small group of influential rich people -- would you call that american? because I'm clearly opposed to it, too. We need the rich people to pay their fair share again. Increasing income gaps are incompatible with stable democracies.

edit2:

What bugs me most about Anti-Americanism is the common idea here that somehow we should be everlastingly grateful for the Marshal plan and the US ""protecting"" us from the big bad soviet union after giving a large part of Germany to them, that we should forever just swallow all bullshit that comes our way and support the american ̶e̶m̶p̶i̶r̶ friends.

Yes, we certainly have to be thankful for the Marshal plan. But then again, we already tried the other way after WW1 and without the treaty of Versailles, WW2 might just not have happened / have been different. 

&gt; You can always trust the Americans. In the end they will do the right thing, after they have eliminated all the other possibilities.

Worst thing that can happen is that you know each other better, end up not being a couple, and still had a great time), be punctual (German-style. Seriously. There's nothing wrong with being 10 minutes late if you said ""around eightish"" instead of ""at eight"", so that's an easy one), if you can't find a common topic to have a sensible discussion about just take turns taking interest in each other, something will turn up (or not). If you have an opinion, back it up or at least admit you can't. 

She's ten thousand times more likely to be interested in your perception of the World and in having some American to dissect until she can find some nature to understand the country with than how much you like the Simpsons. Bonus points for intelligently explaining the one with the other, though. German dating isn't about negotiating contract terms, but learning to know each other while having a good time.

Bases happen as they happen. If you flirt behind her back before your status is clear, you're going to be considered, depending on circumstances, either a pal or a douchebag. (Or both, but you'd need to be me to manage that)

In general, as everyone told me and I bet other German Elders told other kids, (which then were equally dissatisfied with the answer): Be yourself. No relationship is going to hold for long if you start out with negotiating tricks and feints, so, if you aren't a match, well, let it crash and burn.

true,Gro-Tsen,null,null,"&gt; First, I do not speak a word of French. I will be trying my hardest until the 10th to pick up some common phrases and whatnot and will also try my hardest to be respectful while in France. Any advice on this front?

By all means, learn how to say some simple things like ""pardon"", ""merci"", ""au revoir"" (""sorry"", ""thank you"", ""good bye"") and some variation(s) of the following magical phrase: ""excusez-moi, je ne parle pas du tout français; parlez-vous anglais?"" (""excuse me, I don't speak any French; do you speak English?"").  Although a reasonable proportion of them do speak English (the actual proportion depends on how well you need to speak to qualify ;-), Frenchmen tend to find it rude for someone to start speaking English without making the minimal effort of speaking at least *one* sentence in French to make sure that conversation can proceed in English.

Also, when you speak English and find that people don't understand you, try saying things more slowly and more distinctly.  This should be an obvious piece of advice, but for some reason many native English speakers fail to realize that speaking *more loudly* isn't of much help, whereas speaking *slowly* and articulately does wonders.  (For many other languages I would have added the advice ""use simple words"", but in the case of English versus French it's not an obviously good idea, because a good number of the longer and more sophisticated words in English are actually of French origin, so Frenchmen might have more trouble understanding short words of Anglo-Saxon origin.  Anyway.)

&gt; Third, best cheap places to eat?

For French food, any of a huge number of brasseries around Paris.  It's impossible to tell beforehand which are good and which aren't, so just try one which doesn't look too seedy, and if it's good, stick to it, otherwise, move to another one.  I'd recommend staying away from those places which loudly advertise that they have a menu in English, because they're just trying to attract tourists (many restaurants *will* have a menu in English, or at least in Gibberenglish, even if they don't say so outside).

&gt; Where can I find awesome baguettes?

Any of a zillion boulangeries around Paris (although something between 1/2 and 2/3 of them will be closed on any given day in August).  Baguette is the most basic bread they make, and the quality depends much less on the boulangerie you go to than on the time of the day (baguette is really good only for a few hours after it's baked).  So you could try asking a given boulangerie at what time(s) they make their baguettes (generally two or three times during the day, I think) and come shortly thereafter.

But beyond the basic baguette, there are a number of specialty baguettes and other kinds of breads, with strange names that even Frenchmen can't understand or remember (and whose prime function seems to be that the boulanger can make fun of you for stupidly pointing and saying ""je veux ça"" because you don't know what ""ça"" is supposed to be called[#]), and which can be much better than baguette (at least according to most people's tastes).  Sometimes these will be advertised outside the boulangerie.  E.g., ""flûte Gana"" (""flûte"" literally means ""flute"" but refers to a thinner shaped baguette, and ""flûte Gana"" is a trademarked kind of flûte which is made from a special flour, maybe whole weat flour or something), ""Banette"" or others.  These won't be available everywhere.

[#] There is even a kind of bread called ""pain"" (it's a sort of thicker baguette), which is very stupid and very confusing because ""pain"" just means ""bread"".

&gt; Also, should I be worried because I'm going in August?

No.  It used to be the case that everything was closed in Paris in August, but now things have improved enormously.  (Except if you need to see a dentist.  This is still annoyingly difficult.)  Contrariwise, there are a number of things to do specifically in August, e.g., there are [outdoor movie projections](http://www.forumdesimages.fr/fdi/Festivals-et-evenements/Cinema-au-clair-de-lune) and the beaches of [Paris Plages](http://parisplages.paris.fr/).

Both languages are fairly close relatives to English, and you should not have huge difficulties learning either. Both have the same word order and both have two grammatical genders for nouns.

Dutch has more complicated verb conjugation, but I think phonetically it is a bit easier than Swedish (atleast as spoken Sweden; the Finland-Swedish variant lacks certain quasi-tonal qualities which are found in Sweden).

Nicht wirklich. Die Piratenpartei ist in sich selbst zutiefst undemokratisch. Jedes Jahr startet der Wanderzirkus in irgendeine Stadt und veranstaltet einen Bundesparteitag. Hast kein Geld oder keine Zeit dabei zu sein? Pech. Aber deinen Mitgliedsbeitrag nehmen wir gerne. So etwas wurde seit Jahrtausenden kritisiert, ob von den alten Griechen selbst oder von den amerikanischen Revolutionären.

Und dann wird jedes mal gemault, weil die Entscheidungen zu ""südlich"", ""nördlich"", sonstwas waren. Kein Wunder, sind doch Piraten vom Veranstaltungsort und Umgebung immer überproportional vertreten.

Nein, tatsächlich ist Demokratie genauso komplex wie andere Fachgebiete. Auch hier gibt es Jahrzehnte, Jahrhunderte an Wissen. Das kennen aber die meisten Piraten nicht. Da geht's ums Bauchgefühl.

Oh, and if you check it out, don't be scared by the big line in front of the restaurant. If you come by at rush hours, you maybe have to wait 10-20 minutes. So it's best to call and make a reservation if you don't like to wait.

Berlin isn't too expensive. Tuition fees at the TU Berlin are 284€.

As I see it all the different national economical decisions make steering a universal currency very hard and complicated. And if some ""bad scholars"" start to fudge their numbers or start to disregard their debt spending, things can get ugly very quickly. 

My guess is that the euro isn't leaving anytime soon. What I hope they can achieve is some sort of ""safety car"" procedure, that if a given country (after a certain amount of warnings) cannot stay above a certain percentage of GDP vs debt, that a certain EU-led organ will kick in and that said country is obliged to accept their input to get it back on the rails. As soon as the country can reliably and autonomously keep the debt to an agreed minimum, the EU organ would dissolve again. This would then create stability, and calm investors because there is a safety mechanism in place.

Furthermore, I believe they'll be looking at ways to protect the Euro from rating agencies like S&amp;P, be it by setting up an independent European rating agency or introducing other measures to be less effected by the whims of rating agencies.

True. This reminds me of what a friend told me when she returned from Iran. All the public buildings where well heated, to an unpleasent extent, just because they could. To my friend who grew up in Persia but lived in Germany for many years since it felt like a waste.

&gt; In Germany, most public spaces, restaurants, and offices are full of smoke. (Recently, some improvements can be observed.) People habitually throw cigarette butts on the ground. 

That changed dramatically (the smoking, the cigarette butts still litter the environment, but as less people are smoking, they also vanish in time). As a non-smoker I can tell. A joy it is, even some clubs banned smoking. :-)

&gt; In German cinemas, you have to endure a much longer barrage of commercials.

Funny thing. I like the cinema commercials, and consider TV commercials often annoying.

&gt; By contrast, German highway signs are unusable for foreigners (and many Germans) since they eschew points of the compass entirely. In order to navigate on German Autobahnen, you need to know the relative locations of all cities in Germany. The signs won't say ""B1 East"" and ""B1 West"", but instead ""B1 Richtung Bochum"" and ""B1 Richtung Unna"" and you are supposed to know that Unna is East of Bochum.

Never thought of this. But yes, that's how it is. But even foreigners often have a map (or navigations system) when travelling with car in foreign countries.

&gt; Worse, highway intersections in Germany use an utterly braindead and dangerous layout where the cars that are slowing down and leaving a highway have to share a stretch of road with those speeding up and joining the highway. I don't think that system is in use anywhere else

Yes, that is not the best design. I like the way you change from one highway to another in the Netherlands. You are changing the lane very early and then the lane takes a slow turn and joines the other highway. Also, the highways in the Netherlands are well maintained.

&gt; If a German is abducted in some foreign country, German diplomats will engage in negotiations and usually eventually pay some money to the kidnappers. The U.S. never makes such payments, clearly the correct strategy.

true,timoleon,FRNK,Franken,"&gt;It is often believed that the position of President in the US is an extremely powerful one; this is wrong. Essentially all he can do is govern by changing administrative rules and veto or sign laws written by Congress,

A surprising opinion - ""changing administrative rules"" includes in fact such enormous powers as ordering prisoners tortured, and their captivity hidden from judicial review, as G.W. Bush demonstrated. 

As the head of the administration, the president also decides how laws passed by Congress are carried into execution. Bush showed the world with his [signing statements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_statements) that a president can subjectively interpret, delay, distort, or even partially ignore such legislation. Nothing short of a showdown with Congress, or a Supreme Court ruling, could stop him from that.

&gt;Sports betting, prostitution, anal sex, and zoophily are not illegal in Germany

In part incorrect:

- recent legislation has made sports betting, including its online version, into a de-facto government monopoly 

- sex with animals for pornographic purposes is illegal in Germany

- prostitution is legal in some counties in the state of Nevada

&gt;driver's license information is sold to private businesses, something completely out of the question in Germany)

German *Meldeämter*, in charge of the mandatory address registers, will sell the their data to information brokers, unless citizens opt out explicitly. Also, all owners of radios and TV sets - i.e., more or less everyone - have to register with the GEZ, for payment of their broadcast receiver's fee. The GEZ is infamous in Germany for the amount of spying and harassment  it inflicts on its ""customers"".

&gt;While all of this may be partially true, it conveniently ignores the quite noble and enlightened treatment that Japan and West Germany received after the Second World War,

That is a popular myth, but unfortunately untrue. Initially, the treatment was in fact punitive and harsh, resulting in quite a number of deaths among prisoners of war and civilians, e.g. in Winter 1946/47. This was official policy, and only changed with the beginning of the Cold War. For Details see e.g. [here:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_food_policy_in_occupied_Germany)  There were, however, a number of noble and enlightened Americans who did their best to remedy the situation.

2. Pretty sure you won't, but just call your embassy / consultate. They will know for sure.

3. Not very, especially if you want to like together with roommates, because often the landlord lets the tenants select their roommates. As a rule of thumb, the bigger the city the easier it is.

4. Kinda depends on what you call affordably, but most cities are fairly cheap, Berlin probably the cheapest of the large cities. Expensive: Cologne, Münster, Frankfurt, Munich (list is probably not complete). For rent smaller cities are mostly a better choice.

5. As someone else wrote: wg-gesucht.de is a good start.

6. No idea.

7. A problem might be that for the jobs you describe, the employers might not speak well or at all. And the probably won't know the technical terms you need for being a mechanic.
If I were you, I would try calling Iceland's embassies and consulates in Germany. Maybe they have need for a part-time janitor or something. At least just to get you started.
Later, if you start studying working as a ""Hiwi"" kind of an aide to people working of doctorates is the way to go. Usually gives you around 8€ / hour. And it's taxfree as long as you stay under 400€ per month.

8. Others answered this one.

9. There are many cities that offer what you described. Personally, I like both Berlin and Hamburg and the city I studied in: Braunschweig. But afaik the computer science is held in German over here, so tha tmight be a no-go.

10. It's very difficult to hold a full-time job while studying something technical in Germany. Especially, if you would also like to actually have a life. A possible solution: Work for a year and save as much as you can, then live off that money while also having a taxfree job for 400€ a month.

It's hard enough to debate what to cut within a national level where people have some sense of solidarity and care for each others problems, on the pan-Euroean level is nearly impossible, people don't really care if some country halfway accross the contitent is falling back in education or has long waiting lists in healthcare, it is seen as their problem. Therefore, detailed budgeting on a pan-European level is out.

Our basic problem is with the systems and systems of the past on the whole is essentially not capitalism or socialism, but corruptionism.

The kind of free markets vs. governmental control debates Westerners tend to have - and we like participate on the theoretical level - are kind of useless here. Here ""more government"" usually means the elite steals your tax money, and ""more capitalism"" usually means the elite just steals big chunks of public property. It's the same sort of thing. No matter whether we liberate things or whether we introduce more control, we just get screwed by the same kind of parasitical elite both ways. We cannot have capitalism because they hijack any idea that would lead to a truly fair and free market, and we cannot have socialism because they hijack that, too. 

So we work abroad and hope things will get fixed, but I don't think anyone has any working ideas how to fix it. It is one of my hobbies to read a lot of economics, political philosophy, and don't see any working solutions. The logical and ideal solution would be to liberate the market from the bottum up not from the top down as before, i.e. really cut the taxes and the regulations of the individual consumer, the self-employed and the small entrepreneur while keeping control on the big business. However that's exactly the one thing the elite will not allow. They can profit both from socialism and big-business capitalism but not from bottom-up small-business capitalism. So what you do? Revolution? What kind? Socialist revolution? Will be hijacked. Free market revolution? Will be hijacked. There isn't really an option that cannot be hijacked and corrupted.

I recommend you trying in Sitges, Castelldefels or any coast town. Renting a house there is far cheaper (but anyway expensive, houses are rare here). Luckily you can find one with small garden near the beach. The density in that towns is lower also.

I am checking the net about dogs. It is highly probable that the owner will reject you if he finds out that you have dogs, so you can hide them... but, the building itself can ban dogs, so it doesnt matter if the flat owner allows you because dogs are banned.

In the case of Barcelona there is a big park, called ""Ciutadella"", it is also near the beach and near the center, so that maybe a good place for dogs. Also you can try near tibidabo, like vall vidriera, but that is far from the beach.

Honestly, if you want to find a cheap and good place, near the beach that allows dogs, you are in a bad position. You if you have a good amount of money, I'd say you will not have big problems.

true,Britzer,GERM,Germany,"Many people all over the world will say the same thing about Americans and American politics. I don't know about other countries and there are certainly international problems with the US. The the US is the sole super power for example. And that any kind of police (world police in this case) will not have only friends. Also the gap between the rethoric from US politicians and real politics of the US foreign policy is bound to get some people railed up. But think about it. The Soviet 'propaganda' was much worse. And so were their policies. 

In the case of Germany there is a more or less proven case of Anti Americanism in the intellectual left. I myself have suffered from this. I did read [Rolf Winter](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolf_Winter)'s ""Ami Go Home - *Plädoyer für den Abschied von einem gewalttätigen Land.*"" (Ami Go Home - A plea for a parting with a violent country) and ""Gottes eigenes Land? *Werte, Ziele und Realitäten der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika.*"" (God's own country - Values, Goals and Realities of the United States of America), both of which are scathing reckonings with all of Americans biggest faults. If you put everything what is wrong about a country in a single book and keep pouding it home and then mirror it with the best speeches of JFK and the likes, you end up with a pretty ugly picture. Think Michael Moore on steroids, armed with a million facts doing Bowling for Columbine as a pacifist systematically picking apart American history.

We know of so many things that went wrong with America, because of the tradition of transparency. Gulf of Tonkin anyone? Every nation that went to war has something like this. But very few make a big deal about the staged incident that started it. In most cases it is still 'disputed', in stead of clearly staged.

I know very well how Anti Americanism works, because I was right among them. I was one of them. Even before, during and after my one year long High School stay in the US. Only later in life, growing up further, I realized a lot of things about myself.

As I said, I don't know about other countries, and this is not coming from all of Germany. Just a broad range of intellectuals on the left, that suffer from it. Just like the anti immigratin reflexes, that a lot of people suffer from.
