I'm not big on economics, but I've read in some articles that one of the bigger problems the Eurozone has is that its member state economies weren't in *harmonization*, and that achieving said harmonization would somehow be part of solving the crisis. This contrasts with the way I always thought of economies. I saw them as very heterogeneous entities, consisting of different parts, based on unique qualities (resources, geography, technology, (un)employment...), hard to compare without taking a look at the full picture. Now this article seems to illustrate that the EU's economies are indeed very different, and that some reaped the benefits of picking a side, while others suffered (and some due to their own bad choices). So what *are* these parts of a Eurozone nation's economy that can be matched with the others? As in: is there a central rule of thumb that isn't yet in effect but would be beneficial to *all* economies? I can't shake the feeling that such thing does not exist. Also, if it existed, why haven't they enacted it yet?

true,[deleted],null,null,"keeping in mind that i am not an expert about british history in the post world war 2 war, here's a few thought.

the first ""fact"" is actually several facts.

1. margaret thatcher was elected. true.

2. she rode a wave of public opinion to power = she was popular. that's also true. when i visualise the kind of people she was most popular with, though, i can see two people. the infamous guy that broke a tv by kicking it when he heard the sex pistols swearing on tv (the comment of john lydon is priceless: ""didn't he know he could turn it off by pushing a button?"") and my ex-girlfriend, who in the blair years spoke at length about the stupid left was giving all the money to poor chavs and throwing the country down the flush. new government. no more money to ""chavs"". i don't see british economy blooming that much, though. despite the wave of service cuts, and fee increases. but perhaps it's just me and the usual grumpy communists.

3. the unions had become selfish and didn't serve the purpose they were meant to. half true. the unions had become greedy. the purpose of a union, though, is making the best interest of the workers. now, according to one's personal point of view, this ""best interest"" can be anything from ""i will never give in until i get EXACTLY WHAT I WANT"" (which, funnily enough, is exactly what thatcher did, in many occasions), or compromise. so whether or not the unions served the worker's best interest should be left to each person to decide, but without looking back. if we look back, then, yeah, of course they screwed up.

4. the behaviour of the unions (correct me if i'm misunderstanding), made the ""once proud industries being run into the ground"". that's highly debatable. let's concede that the unions had their fair share of guilt, which they did. but if the entire system went down thanks to the union it would be a never-heard-before thing. how about the fiscal system that managed to tax 98% of the most rich people's earning, driving people like John Lennon and the Rolling Stones (and, i'm sure, countless other millionaires) out of Britain?

also, are we talking of a crisis like, say, italy's where the entire system is screwed, and yet the only one needing to pay are the common people? did the politician lower their fees, for example, before someone declared that privatization was the only way forward? when the coal mines were shut down, did anyone actually rised up and say: ""wait a second. the mines have to go, because it's 1980, but what are these people going to do? just sit and die because they've been miners since they were 15 and now they're 45 and can't get another job?"" did a fairer tax system tried out, or did thatcher just embrace the equation ""taxation = evil"" and lowered the taxes for the rich, allowing them to multiply their profits when the rest of the population, how shall we say, didn't do that well? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8YCd9-Xtc8

your second ""fact"" is also highly debatable. sure, some hate comes from the fact that leftie were biting the bullet and they didn't like it. but that's good for the 1980s, not for the 2000s. what makes thatcher especially horrible is that she utterly, openly, completely, didn't give a fuck about the people.

the ""troubles"" in ireland? they should suck it up. fuck these commies that are suggesting even having a dialogue with them. first they can crawl at our feet and ask for forgiveness, then, perhaps, if we feel nice, then we can see if we can throw them a bone.

the miners? they can sit and die.

there is a recession? I know! let's raise the taxes.

What seems to be a most important factor is the attitudes towards education they get from home and neighbourhood surroundings. Most come in and keep the attitude that school is not for them, and they are not for school. Poor results follow, reinforcing that attitude in a vicious spiral. So they just keep at it for a legal minimum. Some even come in never intending to finish elementary school and state it outright. 

Even some who are interested get little to no support from home, and if they are required to work may be hindered. They often show above average effort in class, high interest and capabilities. However, they are still in a uphill struggle, often with poor learning conditions at home and parents unwilling or unable to aid them. Likely they are also looked down upon as either denying their heritage or as a kind of collaborators. In sadly too rare cases when they have proper support, academically there is no difference between Roma and majority students.

Moving to UK would remove communal constaints, and if parents are willing and able to help them, there is no reason to expect lower results. There are some programs of assigning study helpers to children that didn't give up but can't get much or any support and help at home.

Personally, I'm all in favor for devolved English parliament(s) and making the Welsh Assembly a full parliament. I would then have a federal government made up of representatives from all regions within the UK to manage foreign affairs and defense (I'd also base this federal government in Blackpool, but that's not important). I would not expect that federal government to come to big decisions without consulting with the parliaments for each region.

I would say it depends on the extent of the disagreement and how often these disagreements occurs. If one part of a country has a very different social makeup and consistently disagrees on foreign affairs then to me it seems that independence is an option that should be considered.

The obvious parallel with your federal government of the regions seems to be the EU itself, with Commissioners as representatives, and the Council as the major decision making body.

What I would do at first is remove your method of payment (credit card details) asap. You can delete all the credt card details you gave them. And other bank account details.

When Germany was taking on so much of the debt to finance the post reunification rebuilding of the East (still far from complete) European interest rates were kept low because that's what the Germans wanted and the Germans control the ECB.

These low interest rates were a very significant contributory factor to Spain's unsustainable construction sector.

For the past few years Spain has needed lower interest rates to avoid demand destruction in this severe downturn.

However, Germany wants higher interest rates to prevent inflation getting out in the German economy.

And guess where euro interest rates are compared to the UK and US?

Considerably above, whereas before c. 2007 they were considerably below.

So Germany basks in its self-righteous rectitude while Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece suffer from a (for them) over valued currency.

Yes, the Greek state has yet to collect property tax from 2009 by its own inability/unwillingness from an estimated 1.000.000 property owners, but is threatening to shut off electricity to the people too poor or too fed up to come up with money for yet another -unplanned- tax. They did not send the ETAK tax bill to a million tax payers until a couple of months ago - to be clear. 

 They did not replace the old taxes that they had trouble in collecting with a new one that is easier to collect from everybody through the utility bill, as it might seem to the uninitiated in Greek tax system chaos. They simply added another one on top to get some cash quick. And the good ol' property tax is actually getting more expensive than it used to as well.

true,VomisaCaasi,ESTO,Estonia,"From Wikipedia [1]: ""Many local Baltic German aristocrats at the time disliked Forselius’ idea of encouraging peasants to aspire to education and complained that pupils of the schools were taken by the Swedish army or that school fees were expensive."" 

In another words, Estonians at the time were considered too stupid to have expenses allocated for their education, and many thought that would be a hopeless case.

And that's how he solved it: ""Forselius countered this by taking two of his best pupils, Ignati Jaak and Pakri Hansu Jüri (Jüri, son of Hans from Pakri), from the parish of Kambja, to Stockholm, where their abilities impressed King Charles XI of Sweden.""

As for the aftermath: ""By the time of Forselius death in 1688 he had founded 38 schools with 800 pupils in the Estonian areas of Swedish Livonia and 8 schools with 200 students in Swedish Estonia"" [...] ""By the late 17th century, there is evidence that up to 70% of the adult population of Estonia were literate, as compared to 30% - 40% in contemporary Great Britain. By 1898, 97 percent of Estonian population was literate.""


Probably it was the Estonian work ethic that played a big role for the eventual outcome, but I can't see how we are now, almost 350 years later, less equipped when combating with Roma's education problems.

- The UK is a conglomerate, components don't have a claim on the whole.  Bailouts a disaster for Scotand; they'd have to buy their own banks back *if* they were to continue having a serious financial sector.  Scotland leaving the Union will not end dissolve the Union itself, only the Scottish link.  The banks will still be owned by HM Treasury; a controlling share in HBOS and RBS.  The English would actually have more control over parts of Scotland.  Scotland would have to buy them back, which it can probably afford if all things are equal...

They won't be.

- Scottish utilities then come into question.  Much of the costs are spread across the UK as a whole, reducing service costs.   It won't be fuelled by anti-Scottish sentiment, Engish population centres are just closer and more densely populated on average, and much of the infrastructure is there.  Union utility companies aren't going to continue spreading the costs out to non-Union members.

- Then there is a matter of currency.  If Scotland wishes to continue using the pound then fine.  If it decides on a new currency, or the Euro, then it has the cost of changing over to factor in, and possibly losing its control of interest over to either the ECB or the English depending which way it goes.  Neither are going to set the rates to keep the Scottish happy, they'll have their own priorities.  

So all things *not* being equal that leads to the point you raised:  Defence,

- Even if there is a common defence policy between independent Scotland and the remaining Union, and it is an 'if; it's certainly going to have to pay its way.  We're essentially looking at a much scaled back armed forces.  
Those flippant military maneuvers with the French?  After buying the banks back at the peril of the finance sector moving over the border, after spiked living and business costs, after sorting out the matter of currency, it's going to leave a skeletal defence, those military measures might be grown men running around with their arms out making airplane noises.

I'm absolutely fine with either, a common defence policy or going separate ways and a much downscaled military, but with all the extra costs which Scotland will face, even if they are currently a net contributer, there won't be much of a Scottish military either way...unless it wants to make cuts elsewhere by dropping out of the free trade area (which would be unpopular and counterproductive), or make cuts to its largest employer, the NHS (death).",0,1324664480,null,0,false,0,c3am5ul,t3_nmgwg,t1_c3am5ul,t1_c3ahw1u,1428066054,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

That is something we might, or even did, get from either Department of education or some non-governmental organization endlessly and uselessly dealing with the issues. Well, that sounds fine but the question nobody can answer is - how?! Nice, proper sounding questions and answers usually come from places far from front line trenches in education, and are therefore fully irrelevant and disconnected from practice. 

What we should accept is that not getting an education is really a rational choice for some. They have arranged jobs and even marriages waiting. In those cases they need little above basic literacy, and they will not just get by but will probably be earning more then most people that stuck with education, for example us, their teachers. 

There is also another side of the spectrum, cases in which we can really talk about child abuse. In those cases the response is generally the same for Roma and non-Roma kids, that is to say ineffectual, long procedure, bouncing files from school to social services to whatever child protection agency until they leave school and are no longer children.

&gt; Frugality can backfire, however—and in 2011, it did. Keynes had put his finger on the problem, calling it the “paradox of thrift.” One person’s spending is another’s income, he observed. So when everyone spends less in a recession, incomes fall. The more people try to save, the more the economy slows, and the harder it gets to put money aside.

&gt; There’s even a related “paradox of toil.” It says that when an economy is stuck in a rut, with interest rates at or near zero, cutting wages can backfire. Wage cuts lead to expectations of deflation and cause employment to fall rather than rise, says the person who coined the new paradox, Gauti Eggertsson, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That’s a scary thought for the Greeks, who are hoping they can keep the euro but effect an internal devaluation based on lower wages, and in the process make their economy competitive again.

However, it didn't really illuminate the alternatives: Is it possible to keep spending to foster growth or is this behaviour equivalent to just kicking the can a few more years? ",0,1324865525,null,0,false,0,c3b6cpa,t3_nq7hl,t1_c3b6cpa,t1_c3b68xn,1428075776,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
