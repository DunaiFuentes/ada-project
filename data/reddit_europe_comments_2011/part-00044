Since then, there were reforms of the labor market and the welfare system.

On the other hand, income inequality in Germany is still low [by international standards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality), especially compared to countries like the UK or the US, and wages are getting higher now that the economic situation has improved. 

The wage moderation and the reforms certainly helped, but you can't just take that as a recipe and expect it to work elsewhere. A major factor here is a strong manufacturing base, a well trained labor force, and the *Mittelstand*, the many, many SMEs.

In france you need a garant which makes 3 times your rent and pays taxes in france. Sometimes they ask for 4 times, sometimes you need a cdi. The more money around the higher chance you get the app.

This is because you can just not pay for 2 years till they can file a procedure to kick you out which takes another half year and lots of money. If your garant signs a paper they can confiscate 2 years rent as soon as they started the procedure, if you dont have a garant in france they can do jack shit.

Some agencies tell you to open up a bankaccount like secified in OP's post but i checked it out last year and in the end its just wasted money. What you can do is open a linked bank account if your garant's bank is represented in France.

The summer is a hard time to find work since people are going on  vacations and such but I was still able to get enough hours to cover food and rent.

I taught both private lessons and at an academy.  I had never taught before and I was also teaching under the table.  You won't make as much money at an academy as you could teaching private classes (I say could because you have to be proactive to find your work).

If you plan on giving private classes, I can send you the poster I used.  I suggest doing this because my buddy told me what to write down and he set up an ""english academy"" over in Getxo.  He had no actual building and it was all under the table but he had a bunch of clients and hired Enlish speaking students who were studying abroad and wanted some extra cash to spend at the bar.  Ohh this poster will also be helpful for getting calls from academies about work because that's how I got my job at an academy last summer.

Well, you got mainly typical french mainstreams retarded kids answers like ""french music is just bullshit"". That's world known, we only produce massive buckets of gorgeous shit.

Seriously, for deep understanding of french, i recommend you to listen MC Solaar. One of the best song writer at his beginning, inspired by poetry, with many references to philosophical thoughts and ways. You can listen his best album ""Prose Combat"" [right here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhCQn5fEiTs&amp;feature=related).

Try [Hocus Pocus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLvZIsLAERg) too.

If you're more into blues music, [Tété](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mvz7I7Dp5c&amp;ob=av2e) is a very good singer too

[This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--BTGqJmhow) is one of the most beautiful french song and Gainsbourg was very inspirational to next generations of french music, (Le Nouveau Western - MC Solaar is a sample among others). You've got to dig for the movie and the history of this guy, he's a real french legend, many of his texts were related to Verlaine and Rimbaud :)

[Francis Cabrel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85lKsSCZm4k) who is one of the ""common way typical french singer"" with beautiful texts, hate it or love it, you see. There's many of sweet and lovely songs he wrote (insert &lt;3 here) like "" L'encre De Tes Yeux "" or ""Petite Marie"".

Having looked through the relevant law ([Staatsangehörigkeitsgesetz](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/rustag/BJNR005830913.html)), I'm still unsure. One of the main things to consider is whether any of your ancestors gave up German citizenship before conferring it on their kids, since choosing another citizenship (as opposed to automatically receiving it) makes you lose your German one.

The ""trickle down"" should happen if your great grandparents had German citizenship when they came over, and had your granddad on American soil while still themselves having German citizenship. Then he'd automatically be German because of his parents, and American because of Ius soli. This dual citizenship should then have gone to the kids, too. If they had him before they came to the US, he would have automatically lost the German one when he became an American later in life. If they had him there and they themselves had already become Americans, they'd have relinquished their German citizenship in the naturalization process and couldn't have conferred that unto their kids.

What I'm essentially saying is that you would need to find out if all of your ancestors managed to pass on their citizenship without triggering an automatic loss of German citizenship (which is relatively easy to lose compared to an American one).

One thing I've read but couldn't verify was that when German citizens that were themselves already born outside of Germany have children in their country of residence, these kids have to be registered with the German authorities (with birth certificate and all) to automatically receive German citizenship. No idea what happens if they're not registered (which would be the case for you, I assume).

About music:

Most US website don't ship to Europe, but usually you can find one that does. Be careful, depending on your luck, the shipping company and what the seller writes on the label, your package can be checked and you will receive a 20% VAT a few weeks later. But it's generally worth it (again, if you don't need after-sale only).

People actually order a lot of different things from the US to get low prices. My father buys all his running shoes from there, it's much cheaper.

In France, you got these websites: Amazon.fr (you know), LDLC (pretty nice), Grosbill (was good but seems meh now), RueDuCommerce (very known, good prices and average service), Materiel.net (a bit more expensive sometimes, pretty good service), Pixmania (cheap but low service), Cdiscount (low prices but to avoid if you want real service)…

A lot of people buy from real shops: FNAC, Boulanger, Darty, Ubaldi… They have internet websites that offer the same price as in shop, but you get the best service and after-sale since you just have to drop by in one of their shops to get it exchanged (they're everywhere). Recommended for pricey items where you want real after-sale.

Usually I use a price comparator like http://www.prixdunet.com/ or http://www.clubic.com/comparateur-de-prix.html .

You're german if you parent was a german citizen at the time of your birth. My father was born to a German in the US, 2 years before his father naturalized (thus, surrendering his German citizenship). As my father was born in the US, he is also an American. Interestingly enough, he didn't know he was eligible for citizenship until last year, when I did all the research. 

What I did:

Collected the following paperwork:

* My Birth-Certificate
* My parent's marriage certificate
* My parents' birth-Certificates
* My grandfather's German Passport
* My grandfather's naturalization papers
* My grandparents marriage certificate (Stammbuch)

I think that's it, you can get legal copies of most of these with enough patience and a little bit of luck.
Once you have all of this, contact your nearest General Konsulat  and make an appointment. Tell them you want to apply for a passport (which proves citizenship) and presto!

Chances are, if your ancestors immigrated here, they were naturalized within maybe 10 years of coming here. In my case, my father was born 2 years before my grandfather naturalized.**

For the service sector the article might be true and this part of the economy would be affected by a minimum wage, but it would still be more fair to introduce it, because making society pay for those low wages some companies pay is not alright. Anyway, the current success is not coming and not supported from the service sector, that is more a little burden for the rest of the economy, as taxes/social security have to be higher to subsidise parts of it.

Rennes is nice and quite lively, but rather isolated and small. Cheap though. I guess it will depend on how long you plan to stay, and how much/far you want to travel around.

Strasbourg is a really lovely city, at the very middle of Europe. People are very welcoming (some might say too much). Alsace is basically the place where angels whish they could die to go. The food and wine are exquisit and from everywhere in france and the world. It is very international, has the largest university in France, which lead to a large and affordable night life offer. Given your ages, there is no doubt that Strasbourg is a better place for you. I must warn you though that if your stay is relatively short (about 1 year), the departure will only get more painful, and a smaller city might be a better option. it also has a little bobo touch that some dislike.

One more point, Strasbourg is the french city of bicycles. not only dont you need a car, everywhere is thought with bikes in mind, and you can go very far just by bike, making daytrips in the country a delight. Rennes without a car will be more inconvenient and expensive to enjoy after the first 6 months.

There is no EU-wide, unified deposit insurance system, however. The member states have their own national insurance schemes, with varying degrees of coverage and limits.  Some countries offer higher limits, e.g. €100,000.

As the Icelandic financial crisis has shown, in today's financial markets the deposit insurance of smaller countries can easily get overwhelmed.  Greek banks have already seen many customers cashing out, or transferring abroad, the money in their accounts. In the event of a bank run, or even national default, I wouldn't count on depositors actually getting the protection they are guaranteed on paper. 

&gt;Directive 94/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 1994 on deposit-guarantee schemes requires all member states to have a deposit guarantee scheme for at least 90% of the deposited amount, up to at least 20,000 euro per person.

&gt; Why should anybody but the Norwegians decide who is to produce this valuable resource on their own territory?
&gt;
&gt; That is a basic question of democracy and self-determination.

Well, joining the EEA/EFTA means that with respect to (certain aspects of) the economy, everyone has the same rights. The same way that Norwegians could open a company to mine Bauxite in Greece, Greeks should be able to open a company to produce oil in Norway, no?

Are you deliberately trying to ""misunderstand"" the issue?

I linked to an article, but you seem to have ignored it.

The question is the development and exploitation of *Norwegian oil resources* - drilling, pumping, storing, processing etc. 

Not oil merely as a commodity for trade. 

&gt;I remember the referenda, but I'm not going to go there now because I think it detracts from the issue at hand.

Because they ""detract""?  Or because they show how undemocratic and arrogant the EU really is?  

BTW, the Norwegian people rejected EU membership twice before, and this attempt at wresting control over their own resources from them can hardly made the EU any more popular.

&gt;Okay, be that as it may, how would staying out help Serbia in that respect? 

They can import better quality bananas without quota limits or import tariffs. And as many Asian textiles and shoes as they like.

&gt;Wouldn't it be smarter to run with the pack?

Just a few month ago, disappointed Cypriots started a campaign called ""EU donkeys"" on Youtube. Trying to order hardware online, they had to find out that customers in small, less prosperous countries, like Cyprus or Malta, were discriminated by European mail-order stores. 

Either they would not sell to them at all, or only at significant higher prices than to customers in the bigger member states.  So much for the blessings of the EU for the consumer in small countries. Who nevertheless have to pay for all those subsidies and import tariffs. 

&gt;Serbia is relatively poor. It would be a net receiver if it were to join the EU. I hope we can at least agree on that.

Joining the EU is a very expensive process for small countries, because it introduces a veritable torrent of new bureaucratic procedures,  reporting requirements, fees, paperwork, etc. Laws and regulations have to be translated, passed, promulgated, circulated, implemented, controlled, and enforced. 

The compliance costs for the public sector and the economy are considerable. Some of these costs are transitory, others permanent.

true,boq,BAVA,near Germany,"You know, I don't whether you are angry, but I really get that vibe from your text.

Anyway:

&gt;Are you deliberately trying to ""misunderstand"" the issue?
&gt;
&gt;I linked to an article, but you seem to have ignored it.
&gt;
&gt;The question is the development and exploitation of Norwegian oil resources - drilling, pumping, storing, processing etc.
&gt;
&gt;Not oil merely as a commodity for trade.

I'm not ignoring it. Here's what you quoted: ""current requirement that oil operations in Norwegian territory be managed from or be based in Norway."" That is what the European Free Trade Surveillance Authority has a problem with.

I'm asking why a Norwegian company should be allowed to mine Bauxite in Greece, managed from its HQ in Oslo, while a Greek company managed from Athens shouldn't be allowed to drill for oil in Norway? Single market says there can't be discrimination based on nationality, i.e. there must be a level playing field for everyone, but this clearly favours Norwegian companies which are already managed from Norway. Norway agreed to these rules when it joined the single market so why is enforcing those rules bullying?

(You can stop reading here, because I'm really only interested in discussing this single topic.)

&gt;Because they ""detract""? Or because they show how undemocratic and arrogant the EU really is?
&gt;
&gt;BTW, the Norwegian people rejected EU membership twice before, and this attempt at wresting control over their own resources from them can hardly made the EU any more popular.

Because we are discussing whether Norway should have the right to force foreign companies to do things that Norwegian companies in other countries aren't forced to do. Referenda on EU treaties in other countries have little to do with that.

&gt;Just a few month ago, disappointed Cypriots started a campaign called ""EU donkeys"" on Youtube. Trying to order hardware online, they had to find out that customers in small, less prosperous countries, like Cyprus or Malta, were discriminated by European mail-order stores.
&gt;
&gt;Either they would not sell to them at all, or only at significant higher prices than to customers in the bigger member states. So much for the blessings of the EU for the consumer in small countries. Who nevertheless have to pay for all those subsidies and import tariffs.

Well, the EU can't make the geographical isolation of Malta or Cyprus go away. It costs more to ship to them, that's how it is. Same applies to Hawaii or Puerto Rico and the US. It also costs more when I order something from the UK to Germany instead of buying it in Germany. Either way, with the EU there is a legal framework to do something about it. Without the EU, nothing to be done. But again, we were talking about Norwegian oil.

&gt;Joining the EU is a very expensive process for small countries, because it introduces a veritable torrent of new bureaucratic procedures, reporting requirements, fees, paperwork, etc. Laws and regulations have to be translated, passed, promulgated, circulated, implemented, controlled, and enforced.
&gt;
&gt;The compliance costs for the public sector and the economy are considerable. Some of these costs are transitory, others permanent.
&gt;
&gt;If Serbia would eventually benefit from EU membership is a difficult question to answer, especially in the current sovereign debt crisis.

Okay. I see your point. Given that the other eastern members do get more money out than they put in, I'm inclined to believe the same would apply to Serbia.

Wages do not appreciate ""naturally"", unless they are in some way tied to the inflation rate.  They need to be raised, which is inevitably also a political process. 

&gt;the trade deficit of other eurozone countries wouldn't be quite as bad and the bailouts would be smaller, if not non-existent.

""Blame it on the Germans"", that never seems to get old in Europe.

But this argument does not stand a closer look, popularity not withstanding:

&gt;But eurozone countries like Greece and Spain have run trade deficits with Germany since at least 1980 -- 20 years before the euro was established -- while a handful, like Ireland and the Netherlands, have trade surpluses with Germany. 

In 2010, Ireland's trade surplus with Germany was €10.1 billion.  
Overall, Ireland is one of the major exporters within the EU.

&gt;According to IMF statistics, since the introduction of the euro in 1999, Germany's trade surplus with the rest of the world has grown faster than its surplus with the other eurozone countries -- and faster still with European nations that have not adopted the euro. 

&gt;Some of Germany's most dramatic trade growth has been with the East European nations, like Poland, that opened themselves to market capitalism after the fall of the Berlin Wall ... Trade between Germany and the Czech Republic grew to more than $80 billion in 2008. Trade with Slovakia, which recently adopted the euro, is around $20 billion and last year provided Germany with a $1 billion surplus. The Czech Republic and Slovakia both joined the European Union in 2004.

Interestingly, the Eastern Europeans, for all their trade with Germany, do not need bail-outs ...

Student accommodation in Germany is very cheap. My rent is around 160 EUR/Month (Although I'm in a second tier city). I spent some time in the past in Berlin, and food there is very cheap, however I'm not sure how expensive in Western Germany. Probably a comparable price to Italy. Phone plans in Germany are much more expensive than my home country (UK) and if you want a plan you have to sign a 2 year contract. Main network providers are Vodafone, o2 and T-Mobile. You could look on their websites but I imagine at least 40EUR/month.

Choose Germany! It's the best! I also think most Unis offer pre-semester language courses and DaF in semesters.

Yes, they do. The safe, but flexible storage of financial means is a major function of banks, isn't it?

The people of Greece seem to think otherwise.  
To provide some numbers:  in May, the Greek Central Bank released the following information about deposit withdrawals from January 2010 to April 2011

- from privately held accounts, €31 bln
- from commercial accounts, €40.6 bln
- from foreign investors' accounts, €7.9 bln

That adds up to €79.5 bln, which is quite an amount for Greece in her current situation.  

Because of the unemployment, economic slowdown and wide-spread wage reductions, some of this money likely represents savings being spent on living expenses. In other cases, it is transferred abroad.
