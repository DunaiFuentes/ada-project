English is probably the best from the point of view of practicality, but Latin (probably Church Latin, as that has added in words to be able to discuss modern matters) or Esperanto would be more acceptable politically. The original Lingua Franca (that is, the language of those the early mediaeval Turks called Franks) wouldn't be a totally insane language either as it was a kind of creole of old European languages, but hardly anyone speaks it and it lacks a lot of modern concepts.

However, if there is no official policy, eventually I expect all EU officials will end up using English as the Lingua Franca, since the ECB, most scienctists and businessmen, and so on use it already. I don't expect it will be too long before English gains the status it once had in India, or that French and Swahili have in parts of Africa, where everyone has their own language but they speak the language of commerce whenever dealing with non-locals.

In every single comment section, non-BBC European news outlet and conversation I've pretty much heard anti-UK hate. I have thicker skin than most, but your seemingly innocuous and friendly comment drove me over the edge due it's great misrepresentation of the state of the EU-UK relations.

British people don't dislike the EU. Besides some absolutely crazy people, the worst I hear is ""I don't want Europe running Britain"". However ignorant, uneducated, educated or enlightened that person may be, that is not a statement of dislike. Whereas on this thread alone I've seen so much hate from Europeans (especially people sporting little German flags) that I'm sick of it.

If anything is going to cause WW3, it will be this attitude held by Europeans now. I never knew we were so disliked. I always had a fondness for my neighbours in Europe, but in the comments section I see near fuck-all respect for the UK. You know what? Bring on the fucked up world with the next round of idiotic genocides and war. I'll be laughing as our stupid societies crumble down over the idiotic opinions of manipulated laymen allow our politicians to turn us against each other.

I really don't care whether the UK is a part of the EU, but I do care that it seems to be causing actual Europeans and actual British people to hate each other for no reason.

Seriously, what have we all done to begin hating each other? I don't remember veto-ing any treaties, or supporting any treaties. I don't remember drafting it up or agreeing to it. I don't even remember the party I voted for gaining a majority. I suspect that the majority of people in Europe are the same. Yet, still, the politicians and media will turn us against each other, make us hate each other and it will end up in war. War is nearly always caused by economic problems masked with religious or ideological bullshit.

In order to fend off this imminent ‘attack’ on our free-wheeling anglo-saxon model of capitalism (irony alert), Cameron took the opportunity on thursday night for the following:

• Any transfer of power from a national regulator to an EU regulator on financial services would be subject to a veto.

• Banks should face a higher capital requirement.

• The European Banking Authority should remain in London. There were suggestions that it might be consolidated in the European Security and Markets Authority in Paris.

• The European Central Bank be rebuffed in its attempts to rule that euro-denominated transactions take place within the eurozone.

Lord Oakshott:

&gt; The idea that in the worst crisis in a generation our top priority for our prime minister today is to protect the fat cats in the City is extraordinary. There's not much of a threat. There's some perfectly sensible proposals about more transparency and better corporate government in hedge funds which are perfectly reasonable. You do need some supra-national regulation. British regulations on their own haven't proved a great success in the past. Cameron is banging the drum because it's a simple scare to do – and many of the Tory donors are in the city. 

Richard Murphy, Tax Research UK:

&gt; [The proposed European legislation] is about accountability and transparency and making sure that people pay their taxes. It's about effective markets. Why are they trying to maintain the status quote which is so flawed? Demanding a hedge fund is run, regulated and taxed in the same place is right. This is not being anti-market; it's arguing for a good market. 

The ""Verdict"" of the author:

&gt; Is the City really under threat from Europe? Yes. The financial regulations being implemented and considered in Europe are largely a response to the last financial crisis and measures such as a financial transactions tax, the reform of short-selling and hedge-funds are all designed to create more responsible behaviour in all the major financial centres. The banks certainly see that as a threat to them; it is supposed to be.

&gt; Whether the response is proportional or not depends on the faith you have in the City and whether you want to protect, control or punish it.

and a quote that ends the article, from a German newspaper:

&gt; **but the british don't just want to stop the Financial Transaction Tax that Merkel wants. They want to withdraw from already established European banking regulation and wouldn't even accept the new Basel-III rules for credit institutions.** These plans would create nothing less than a british special zone in the EU, where precisely the unregulated speculation that Merkel wants to stop, would continue.",0,1323515456,null,0,false,0,c36thec,t3_n68j4,t1_c36thec,t1_c36ouwk,1428000233,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I think though he fears the wrong thing. What would be much worse for the UK would be if a new set of institutions are drawn up, which then compete with the EU. Since any country's veto can stop EU legislation it would just need one or two countries each time, to stop any EU action and then follow up with a new action by the New EU (NEU?). This scenario would be much worse for those who stay out, because they won't have much of a chance to join in later - and if they do it, they will have lost a lot of ground.

Frankly, this summit should have happened when the Euro was set up.

In theory, you could get a permit if you could convince the local authorities of the city you want to move to that your business would be good for the local economy, and that you'd make enough to live off it. But in practice, I don't think you'd be able to meet those requirements if you want to set up a small photography studio with very little capital and no employees.

For a photographer to be able to hire you, s/he would have to show that there are no qualified applicants from within the EU. Again, this would be difficult, to say the least.  
And I guess that unless you somehow manage to turn into a celebrated hot-shot photographer by the time you graduate, a special skills artist visa would be equally difficult to obtain.

Currently, there are some changes on the way to simplify immigration to Germany for skilled professionals, but since photography isn't one of the ""MINT"" professions (maths, engineering), a relevant job offer would have to pay €44k for you to qualify.

Frankly, this is going to be very difficult, unless you enroll and graduate at a German university.

I suppose the Europeans will have to pass some laws to ammend the single market in financial services.

The Germans probably won't mind too much about this because they'll finance their own stuff but everyone else in euroland will be paying more than they should for their finance.

As such the Europeans are handing yet more competitive advantage to emerging markets and the Americans.

Now we're trying to correct that mistake to bring long-term stability to the Euro zone. This is what this was all about.

Dave's problem is that any change to the Lisbon Treaty would have forced him to call a referendum. Maybe not legally, because the coalition agreement only requires a referendum if powers are transferred from Westminster to Brussels, but practically because his own party would insist on it. That is a referendum that the British government would certainly lose, paving the way for another referendum on leaving the EU. He doesn't want that, at any cost.

To avoid further delays and difficulties, and I'm of the belief that Cameron, Sarkozy and Merkel all agreed on this, he simply took the UK out of the present discussions and left the rest to get on with it. Now the Eurosceptics owe him a favour and Merkel can get on with saving the Euro.

For better and for worse, the UK has made the Financial Services industry the core of much of what we do as a nation. This means we make a great deal of money from that sector, but it also means we are particularly vulnerable to any changes in Financial Services legislation imposed by the EU.

That is exactly what France and Germany did during the latest summit, they put the UK in a position that made the use of the veto inevitable. The UK *cannot* allow any treaty to go ahead without safeguards to protect the financial services industry, if we did, then it would mean that France or Germany could later push legislation though that would decimate our economy, and they could do it almost at will.

true,Kim147,UKGB,United Kingdom Thanks,"Further look at what the various key acts post WWII did - they very much protected the middle class - the generators of the economy - and they protected and encouraged the bottom up . Look at Bretton Woods , look at Glass-Steagall , look at media ownership laws and regulations , look at conflict of interest laws and regulations and laws and regulations against monopolies . The leaders at that time realised just how important these all were .

In the mid 70's we , as a massive result of these laws and regulations and the bottom up and the associated freedoms , had a surplus of investment moneys looking at a shortage of safe investment placements . This led to the debt culture - both private - corporate and personal - credit cards etc. - and public - government . It was also a time of the building up of the corporations - mergers and acquisitions . And it was a time of building up of many political monoliths - both government and QANGO .

We are now at a time that is unsustainable . We are in a massive hole and some of us are hell bent on keeping digging . It is the 20's and 30's repeated . Me - I think we should stop digging and change course very quickly .

Seems to skip the simple majority vote to establish the existence of the breach of the stability pact, rest seems same - qualified majority vote to overrule the Commission-imposed penalties.

Likewise with monitoring, which sounds much like the already introduced European Semester system. The text of the agreement does say it 'builds upon' those three systems (europlus, europan semester and the new stability and growth pack) , so I guess this is unsurprising. 

I don't think these systems are that toothless though - in past, it precisely the now-patched-up easiness of blocking vote and lack of credible punishments that enabled countries to ignore the stability pact commitments - but that remains to be seen.

Golden rule obligation is already a part of the 'Euro Plus' pact, so again nothing new. Though giving the ECJ power to rule over the correctness of the transposition of that rule in national laws, like with directives, sounds significant, since before, no such obligations sounded particularly credible.

The most substantial difference imho then is making the decisions to release the ESM/EFSF funds by a supermajority rather than unanimity, and bringing ESM's timetable forward. So no future Slovakian etc dramas.

But neither has anything to do with financial services negotiations, Cameron was it seems just suggesting some horsetrading to get his way in a decision where he'll easily get outvoted otherwise. And failed. I can't see how anything else could have happened, since accepting unanimity voting in single market issues would be rewinding the clocks for decades, in terms of the functioning of EU..

true,U3dlZXQgSmVzdXM,EURO,European Union,"In fiscal union as I and economists I quote seem to understand it, there would be fiscal measures that would stabilize differences between economic cycles. I have been bemused for some time how this discussion can go on so that nobody explains how monetary and fiscal policies are supposed to work. 

It seems that everybody thinks that:

1. This is about overly generous social contracts. Spain and Italy (soon France, I guess) are not like Greece. In 2008 Spain's debt to GDP ratio was shrinking and it was smaller than in Germany. Italy had big debt but it was working it down, not bad at all. 
2. When country is in recession, government should cut spending and pay off debt and this will somehow magically grow economy. In reality, fastest way to reduce debt to GDP is to increase GDP or at least prevent it from shrinking. 

&gt;In such a world, fiscal union is an essential counterpart to monetary union. If the gumbo industry goes into decline, driving the US state of Louisiana into a recession, residents will pay fewer federal taxes and receive more fiscal transfers. These financial flows are a natural counter-cyclical mechanism that helps local and regional economies to weather bad times. In a hypothetical European fiscal union, there would certainly be transfers from Germany to the periphery in 2011, but a properly designed setup would have ensured flows to Germany in the 1990’s, as it struggled to cope with the costs of reunification with East Germany.

&gt;With this in mind, the most obvious point about the recent summit is that the “fiscal stability union” that it proposed is nothing of the sort. Rather than creating an inter-regional insurance mechanism involving counter-cyclical transfers, the version on offer would constitutionalize pro-cyclical adjustment in recession-hit countries, with no countervailing measures to boost demand elsewhere in the eurozone. Describing this as a “fiscal union,” as some have done, constitutes a near-Orwellian abuse of language.

It was all ""Here, join the EU, we'll give you money to reform your country and in return, you'll give it right back to our banking and industrial sectors"". 

That's why it was so easily put forth for decades. It allowed the further expansionist intents of the industry and banking sectors of the bigger countries. Now, those interests are set on another horizon. Whats coming for us is this neoslavery of everyone bellow the *banksters* social tier. They're collecting and they're repossessing. Very few will be able to keep paying.

I also doubt the referred treaty changes are ever submitted, given the market behavior, let alone put in practice. I say that same thing for those constitutional changes many countries are setting up.

Enshrining deficit limits is ridiculous wishful thinking. In an age where constitutional rights conflict and get trampled on by the many governments, it is really really infantile.

As for Germany, I see Germany playing their game, as always, protecting their own interests, their own agendas and bullying Europe into submission. They don't anything that isn't in the interest of their elites. 

Good for the UK. But bad also, because the UK is actually a nest of financial malpracticing. If you track the global money trail, it leads to a lot of UK based mega-clusters. 

What would take to solve the issue is real courage. Take on the need reforms announced on the treaty changes and apply them fast. Get rid of the unlawful lobbying. Clean all parties of it.

Pretty much spot on.

""If the British political class does not undergo a fundamental transformation, there is only one possible answer. Out.""

Wildly off the mark, however!

Every polity is, at least in part, the creation of its shared social and cultural history, and this will lead to differing aims and expectations of what society and the state should do, and where the balance betwixt the two should reside.

If this shared social and cultural history is not very distinct from that of its neighbours this will obviously minimise the barriers to cross-polity governance.
If that history has involved endless shifting national borders resulting in nations and states to do not match this might even encourage cross-polity governance.

It is a recognised factor that proportional governance is most applicable, and most attractive, precisely when society is heterogeneous with many large and distinct socio-cultural groups.

If in the case of britian, neither of the two factors apply to any great degree then you will struggle to produce cross-polity governance that is [both] representative [and] accountable, and thus it won’t be considered legitimate.

This can of course be fudged in the good times, because there is no incisive event that demands radical policy, likely to prove greatly more contentious with one group or the another, but it’s a different case when the bad times roll around.

Supranational governance is not considered legitimate in Britain for this very reason, for all that casual racism can and does effect the view of a tiny minority in any and every polity across the globe.

&gt;The European Commission is not elected but appointed

well:

Art.17.7 TEU:

&gt;Taking into account the elections to the European Parliament and after having held the appropriate consultations, the European Council, acting by a qualified majority, shall propose to the European Parliament a candidate for President of the Commission. This candidate shall be **elected** by the European Parliament by a majority of its component members. If he does not obtain the required majority, the European Council, acting by a qualified majority, shall within one month propose a new candidate who shall be elected by the European Parliament following the same procedure.

&gt; The Council, by common accord with the President-elect, shall adopt the list of the other persons whom it proposes for appointment as members of the Commission. They shall be selected, on the basis of the suggestions made by Member States, in accordance with the criteria set out in paragraph 3, second subparagraph, and paragraph 5, second subparagraph.

&gt; The President, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the other members of the Commission shall be subject as a body to a vote of consent by the European Parliament. On the basis of this consent the Commission shall be appointed by the European Council, acting by a qualified majority.

The current comission president was the commission president candidate of the victorious EPP party in last elections. Pretty standard procedures, albeit with a strong upper house.

&gt;and it writes all legislation, implements all legislation, and runs the EU.

as do governments generally.

EDIT:

&gt;here are advantages to the EU but more representation is not even remotely one of them.

oh, I agree - there are many better and more democratic system within the EU than the one used in EU institutions. I just don't think UK has one of them.

&gt;Can you imagine the size of their constituencies! ... More representative, a constituent would never be able to meet them

And this would matter in a system of proportional elections how exactly? Ideally the size of the constituency would be the whole 500 million, since best proportionality is obtained if its calculated on whole-parliament level. A couple of hundreds of thousands people per (multi-winner) constituancy is perfectly common; even my tiny county has such sized ones.

And made the little effort to cut through the usual circumlocution, the agreement, to be adopted in March (year not stated) if not before, says, 

The European Commission has the final say on a nation's economic policy if there is a budget deficit in excess of 3% of GDP or a national debt in excess of 60% of GDP. 

This was obviously completely unacceptable to the UK from the start.

Anyone putting this on the table infront of the UK would know this unless they were a delusional fool.

To suggest Cameron overplayed his hand is rubbish.  In the circumstances he had no hand to even play.   There wasn't even a card game going on. 

The relevant passage is at the top of page 4 on the link and states,

""As soon as a Member State is recognised to be in breach of the 3% ceiling by the Commission, there will be automatic consequences unless a qualified majority of euro area Member States is opposed. Steps and sanctions proposed or recommended by the Commission will be adopted unless a qualified majority of the euro area Member States is opposed. The specification of the debt criterion in terms of a numerical benchmark for debt reduction (1/20 rule) for Member States with a government debt in excess of 60% needs to be enshrined in the new provisions.""

true,Elanthius,null,null,"Most notably the government had earlier promised that there would be a referendum if we ever had to sign a new treaty. They later backed off a bit and said that the referendum would only happen if significant power was handed over to Brussels. In any case if they had gone ahead without the referendum they would have looked like right numpties and suffered a significant, probably fatal blow at the next election. If they did have the referendum it would absolutely definitely have been rejected by the British people and the whole thing considered a ridiculous waste of time and money. The financial problems in Europe have made Britain very sceptical of the whole European project.

The UK Government aren't focusing on that because it doesn't paint them in a great light. They are mostly focusing on the Tobin tax that everyone else in Europe has agreed to. This ""transaction tax"" will be a significant blow to the financial industry in London. This industry represents a dangerously large percentage of the UK GDP so until we can balance the economy better it would be very costly to chase away these companies to Singapore/Hong Kong/Zug/New York. 

In my personal opinion the Government was absolutely right. The Euro has only been around for a decade and there's a significant risk (still) that it could fail. It was very lucky for us that we didn't join and everything that everyone who was against the Euro said now appears to be correct. It largely depends on the details of the transaction tax but it is highly likely to be a pure disaster for companies that trade on margin like those who trade futures and options and other derivatives. I wish England had a more balanced economy but the situation we find ourselves in is that we cannot pay our bills without the taxes paid by these huge financial companies that could essentially be based anywhere in the world.",0,1323552638,null,0,true,0,c36wymq,t3_n7nvj,t1_c36wymq,t3_n7nvj,1428001867,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

Of course France and Germany will be uncompetitive as a result of this tax but they are already pretty uncompetitive when it comes to the financial industry so this will hardly affect their economies. None of the European countries really see this tax as a big deal since their financial sectors are relatively small and of course sticking it to those evil banks is a surefire votes winner (even in Britain).

Basically Sarkozy and Merkel tried to use the crisis in the eurozone to force the EU as a whole to fundamentally alter its financial sovereignty, and that was something that would never pass through the UK parliament (and indeed is apparently likely to fail to pass through some other countries' parliaments also).

Hell you could argue that the economic crisis of the last few years is due to politicians making decisions to win votes rather than in the best interest of their countries. 

I know certainly it was the case in Ireland. Fianna Fail were using the revenue off a property bubble to buy elections, increasing the public finances to levels that were unsustainable once the eventual crash happened. They did nothing to protect the country and to try to keep us competitive with other EU states, instead contributing the inflation and the cost of living and spending our money.

But most floating voters just wanted to believe that it would go on forever, and they wanted the short term benefits that FF promised them, so they kept on giving them the vote.

If our government could have balanced the budget, or been close to being able to do it, for the last few years, then we could have taken this bank collapse in our stride. We could have told the EU for fuck off, and burnt the bondholders, because we wouldn't have been reliant on the bailout money to pay for the country's day-to-day expenditure.

But can you really blame Fianna Fail? Had they campaigned on responsible economic policies they would have been dumped out of power of the Irish voters and I know that no other party before 2008 was running on the idea of deflating the bubble as no one would have voted for them. 

I am a firm believer that this mess was created just as much by the flaws in democracy as the lack of banking regulation.

Through out this whole crisis Sarkozy has constantly been by Merkel's side. Why, because he knew that when shit hit the fan, he wanted a say in how the E.U and the Euro are structured. Cameron on the other hand never offer much of any support and even criticism at times. Germany, the U.K and France are the E.U strongest powers but at-least 2 are need to get anything done so without Britons support it was natural that Germany would rely on France as its main ally. Sarkozy well aware of this and being more media savvy than Merkel,only had to play the attack dog in order infuriate the U.K and Cameron in order to make him keep his distance. With Cameron isolated Sarkozy only had to wait for Cameron to make a mistake, which he did this splendidly by bringing up financial regulation exemptions at a meeting to determine the fate of the E.U. This is not say his demands weren't justified but he brought them up at the wrong place at the wrong time. Now Europe is moving forward with a plan that is Sarkozy's brainchild and Britain is left to watch on the sidelines. 

If Cameron was smarter (not to ask he is dumb but he made a mistake) he would done a better job cultivating a relationship with Merkel, this would have allowed him to negate some of Sarkozy's influence and I am sure Merkel was have welcome the support  as strong counter-weight to the head strong Sarkozy.

true,Bhima,ASTR,Austria,"As far as I have been able to find out the general consensus is that large crudely designed and un-offset financial transaction taxes have negative qualities which do not overcome the positive aspects, while smaller more skillfully designed transaction taxes with offsets have less drawbacks and sufficient stabilizing effects...  Surely they are not going to generate enough revenue to solve the debt problems in any of these countries facing them

There was a Czech study a few years ago that which modeled a few of these transaction taxes which suggested that crude and relatively high taxes would have few benefits.  And it's the modified proposals after that study that avoid those sorts of problems (and interestingly are not the proposals that people against transaction taxation talk about).  

Obviously the more markets that implement such a tax the better, and outside of the largest markets there is likely a sort acceleration of adoption as truly destabilizing practices (that are not all that socially beneficial) flee for less regulated markets... thereby making those smaller already volatile markets unacceptably volatile.  However, as everyone has observed the Americans and the British are more or less completely subservient to their large financial institutions and so highly unlikely to go along with broad intra-market tax harmonization plans.  This is where the proposals have to get really skillful.

For example, if there was an EU zone wide financial tax, it would encourage some firms to leave Europe for the less regulated markets in the UK, US, or Japan.  If all the revenues from that tax went to lower the corporate tax rate with the requirement to be eligible these corporations had to do business in, be listed in, and do the bulk of their trading in that market.  This sort of offset will help keep businesses which happen to employ socially beneficial trading or hedging in the market while pushing the most socially useless most volatile schemes out of the market.

Something which I don't know is the dynamic of the smaller markets adopting such taxes first.  For example if Asian markets adopted a small transaction tax would that force market manipulators to flee to other BRIC markets and cause sufficient instability there to push those markets to adopt similar taxes... and start a cascade without the US and UK... or perhaps before the US and UK, because faced with a world of more stable markets and a flood of destabilizing trading schemes entering their markets, it could that the US and UK markets would not be large enough to absorb that level of instability.

Yes, there are ways to implement a transaction tax which have benefits which outweigh downsides (though perhaps those benefits are not the ones some folks might desire).  So I think it's important to keep in mind these are modest tax schemes with comparatively modest goals.

I suppose I need to stress that in reality a given market does not really want every possible or existing business or every trade.  So that a business or trading scheme flees a market in response to reasonable regulations is not automatically a bad thing.  In fact if such a taxation scheme drove out the most worst players in the market it would be a benefit.  The least socially desirable and most volatility inducing trades, for example. This would make room for the sort of trades we all want and need.  Like firms who hedge on commodity futures markets for commodities they actually and honestly use.

Yes, certain types always find away to subvert regulations.  This is something both Libertarians and Marxists agree on.  Personally I don't really find their common responses of Therefore No Rules or No Corporations completely compelling. Though I would support a reformation of the corporate charter.

You appeared back on the map in 1878. after the Great Powers of Europe decided you should exist. Ever a peaceful race you managed to last 7 years until you invaded Bulgaria, and lost.

Your tactic was simply to murder the fuck out of everybody who didn't agree with you and try to turn everbody into a Serb. Eventually the other parts of Yugoslavia declared independence from Serb rule, and ever since then you've basically warred against your neighbours, still of course murdering people as much as you could, the last of your wars was when you tried unsuccessfully to murder Kosovo until it gave up - you failed there as the UN had to come in to stop you from killing literally everybody who wasn't a Serb.

Analysis
Myth and Reality About the Euro Crisis
By THOMAS CATAN

It's tempting to view the European debt crisis as a simple morality tale. Hard-working, fiscally responsible northern Europeans such as the Germans and the Dutch are being forced to pick up the tab for their profligate southern neighbors—the Greeks, the Italians and the Spanish.

Germans tend to see the problem this way and, increasingly, so do many U.S. commentators. Unfortunately, that attractively simple story doesn't always stack up—most notably in the case of Spain.

In 2007, before the crisis struck, Spain had a modest debt load representing just 36% of its economy, according to European Union figures. And those responsible Germans? They had 65%.

A Madrid pizza shop uses a sign of a euro coin to advertise its prices.

During the past decade, Germany repeatedly breached the euro rules by running too large a budget deficit. Spain actually ran a modest budget surplus in the years before the crisis hit.

But haven't things changed since then? The German economy has powered through the crisis while the Spanish economy has languished, so you would think the two would have traded places.

You'd be wrong. Last year, Spain's public debt load represented 61% of its economy. Germany's rose to 83%. In fact, Spain's debt burden last year remained below that of the Netherlands (63%), France (83%) and, for comparison, the U.S. (93%).

So if public debt is your yardstick, then the Spaniards were paragons of virtue. They borrowed lightly despite the fact that their euro-zone membership gave them an all-you-can-eat buffet of financing at bargain-basement rates.

As Europe scrambles to find a solution to a debt crisis that's threatening the world economy, it's crucial to understand what actually happened in countries like Spain. Otherwise, policymakers will end up prescribing the wrong medicine, with disastrous results.

""The whole euro-zone strategy is predicated on the assumption that fiscal ill-discipline caused this crisis,"" said Simon Tilford, chief economist for the Center for European Reform. ""That is a radically incomplete analysis.""

If you believe that Spain's problem was that its government spent and borrowed too much, then the solution is simple: more austerity. But Spain's problem wasn't public debt—it was private debt.

For much of the past decade, the European Central Bank set interest rates at the appropriate level for countries like Germany. That rate was far too low for countries, like Spain, on the euro-zone's edge.

So for years, Spain actually had negative real interest rates, because its inflation rate was higher than the ECB-set interest rate. That gave Spanish households and businesses a huge incentive to borrow. They did, with gusto, and ploughed the money mostly into housing, inflating a giant property bubble.

When the financing dried up after Lehman collapsed, Spanish banks and households were saddled with a glut of overpriced housing. As Spaniards labor to pay off that debt with ever-shrinking assets, the economy has ground to a halt, and unemployment has soared to 23%.

That means that the economy cannot restart and makes investors leery of lending to a country without any growth prospects.

Seeking to get back into the good graces of investors, the newly elected Spanish government has vowed to impose punishing new austerity measures. That could prove counterproductive. With households and businesses still paying down their debt, further cuts in government spending could tip the economy back into recession. And that, in turn, will make Spain less able to service its debts.

""Fiscal austerity of this order against a backdrop of recession is only going to make things worse, says Mr. Tilford. By prescribing only austerity, euro-zone leaders ""have already dramatically exacerbated the problems in Portugal, Greece and Ireland. Now they risk making similar mistakes in Spain and Italy.""

So even though it's wrong, the idea that Spain took on too much public debt that it cannot now pay threatens to become a self-fulfilling prophesy.

If government spending wasn't the problem in Spain, then what was? The country's experience points to a different, more troubling culprit: the euro itself.

The prevailing view of the crisis is that southern Europeans destroyed the euro with their spendthrift ways. But in Spain's case, you could make the opposite case—that the euro has destroyed its economy.

According to this line or argument, Germany wasn't a victim of the single European currency—it was its chief beneficiary. Interest rates were set at a low rate for their benefit, even as other, overheating euro members snapped up their exports.

But after that unsustainable model broke, it was Spaniards who have been left to suffer the consequences. Nearly a quarter of their work force is unemployed and the country is facing years of economic misery. Meanwhile, Germany has been enjoying a spurt of economic growth.

The point here isn't to assign blame for the crisis. There's plenty of that to go around. It is that the truth is more complex than either of those caricatures. If Europeans accept the prevailing morality play that sets some member nations against others, they'll all end up the losers.

• Any transfer of power from a national regulator to an EU regulator on financial services would be subject to a veto.

• Banks should face a higher capital requirement.

Yes, there is a segment of our society that has advanced, post-national, human-dignity-minding view on politics. It's the kind of sunday speech politics you often find the president saying. It's how things should be, what doesn't mean that we're acting that way as a nation. There's a huge gap between what our constitution says and what the [Bundesverfassungsgericht](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Constitutional_Court_of_Germany) keeps deciding and what goes on in every day politics. We're defined as a social market economy, have paragraphs like [""Property entails obligations. Its use shall also serve the public good.""](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P14), yet the poor get poorer while the rich get richer. We have the basic human dignity as highest good in our constitution, the [BVerfG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Constitutional_Court_of_Germany) recently decided that we can't shoot down kidnapped airplanes even if we knew that they're going to be flewn into buildings, yet somehow we're engaged in the Afghanistan War, for no good reason at all. 

So not even within our politics, these grown-up ideas have really taken foot, the disconnect to the common people couldn't be worse, I'm afraid.

IMO the tension stems more from anger of a failed opportunity to act as a true union rather than ""we hate everything from the UK"" as some bitter people would have you believe. The (long overdue) situation left no time and no leeway for much politics. Cameron probably never envisioned it to blow up like that. But it did, and while I believed it had to happen someday, I'm still sad to see the UK walk out. Because I believe Cameron miscalculated the outcome. But perhaps it's good for both parties to realize their own plans for now and see where everybody ends up. The door will always be open, though.

Furthermore, those slinging the Europhile and Eurosceptic terms around engage too much in black and white thinking, negating everything even slightly positive and inflating even the most miniscule of errors and vice versa. The truth is somewhere in the middle, and while the European Union surely has its flaws, I believe we must work together as a union and see it as a strength rather than a weakness, as its separate parts are no match on their own versus any established world powers.

Or it simply stands that democracy is a lot healthier in the UK than it is in India and the US.  And when you look at it, it is.  Politically the US is stuck with no real alternative.

So not elected by the people, again the 'demo' in democracy, and everybody else in the Commission is directly appointed i.e. it is not democratic.

Still not voted for by  the people, again.  Every MP and MEP is voted for directly by the public, MEPs obviously being far less representative, but Commissioners aren't.  The public never voted for Peter Mandelson or Baroness Ashton to be commissioners.  Mandy even took Commission after being forced from public office, Ashton has never held public office.

in a way camerons hands were tied, if he signed the treaty he is legally obliged to hold a national referendum on our participation in europe, if he vetoed we become the outcasts of europe

the bottom line is either way we would be where we are now and everybody in europe knew this was the situation from the beginning.

the thing is we and europe have very different ideas about its purpose, we like the idea of a common market and open trade, they are pushing to create a european superstate to stand alongside the US and China as equals. at some point, perhaps on friday, we come to a crossroads.

if you have a look there is a really interesting thread in the uk forum where someone has posted the list of 'demands' cameron made from the FT and actually they sound quite tame. these demands have been known for a long time so it is telling that they completely unfactored into the deal or rejected without negotiation. its not as if he turned up and surprised everyone.

one factor you need to consider as well is that sarkozy and merkle are up for re-election soon and cameron is trying to hold together a coalition.

all three have good relationships but at times they need to ham it up to play to their own domestic audiences.

think about it, these stories about sarkozy having to be physically restrained are bordering ridiculous, he couldnt punch a hole let alone a person, its like being accused of being mugged by mr tatum. all drama. 

even the whole thing about him snubbing camerons handshake, the photo looks bad but the video shows two guys walk past each other

true,edsballs,null,null,"the whole problem with a financial tax is that it doesnt affect the big boys, it will just hurt the smaller market participants.

any market is a balance between buyers and sellers, when there are more buyers the market goes up, sellers down.

if you want stable markets there needs to be liquidity and a more or less equal balance of opposing participants.

the big guys can survive with a tax, it wont be great for them but they will just ramp up their fees. its the smaller fish who will get burnt.

if you look at eur usd, 40% of that market is retail investors. lets just lump in all the differing institutional participants together and say they have 60% of market share.

retail traders follow trends and use technical analysis primarily ie they look at charts to ascertain a strategy

institutional investors work on client flow ie. client x wants to sell EUR 200m today, lets sell.

institutions use the movements of the retail investors to get the best positions possible. you can see it some times in the charts, the market is really trying to push up but whenever it gets to a certain point it gets slammed back down again sharply.

thats because an institution will be waiting for the retail investors to push prices up to a favourable level before selling that 200m in chunks

once they stop selling the market eventually breaks higher if the retail momentum is still there.

Its not as clean as my example and overlaps occur a lot but that is a basic example.

Bare the above in mind... If you tax financial transactions the following will happen; 

the retail 40% will get squeezed out because they dont make fortunes and they already get ripped off on spreads by brokers.

the big boys will just wait and execute their transactions on a monthly or quarterly basis rather than intraday

that means that 40% of the counter balance liquidity in the market is gone meaning that it is dominated by the institutions.

consequentially, if bank x decided to sell EUR 4bln one Quarter, there is nobody there to provide balance to their trade

When they sell, the move is completely amplified and what might be a 2 point move today could explode into a 6point move in the future because there is nobody providing the counterbalance to the trade.

a spin off from that is when you put algorythims into the equation, they are programmed to pick up on fluctuations and jump in at certain points.

think back to the flash crash in 2010, the story is a fat fingered trade caused an accidental huge price drop which was so big that it got picked up by the algos which went into a death spiral.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5TfL4guItI

watch this video, this could be a regular occurance, with or without algos on a regular basis if the liquidity gets sucked out of a market.

Of course a lot of people don't see the EU like this but everybody would complain if they need to change they money again and if can't just travel to another countries and have to wait at the border.

I think if our cultures would more similar in Europe, we would just say ""I'm from Europe"". But they aren't because we were so much separated in the past. But you can see the change of the minds of Europeans. Take France for example. A few years ago, if you didn't speak French you were pretty much fucked. Most French people just don't want to speak English and want at least that you try to speak French. Today, It's impossible to learn French if you live in Paris. I know a woman who lives in Paris since 2 years and she can't speak French very well. She doesn't know any grammar and has a lot of problems with vocabularies. And why? Because as soon as she says ""Bonjour"" people answer her in English because they hear that she isn't French. The younger generations don't even care about the the nation you were born. Of course they ask about differences if they are interested but I never saw somebody who has problems with foreigns. 

Europe grows more and more together and I like this. Even the politicians. Have you ever seen Merkel and Sarkozy? If they see each other they always kiss on the left side and on the right side. It's common for French people if they know you well of if you are a part of the family (I have family in France and I always felt that I had make up on my face but I never met a lot of these people). They also are pretty close together if they talk or Sarkozy touches Merkel like they are close friends.

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"When Cameron and the Conservatives took power, a pushed a law through Parliament stating that if a new EU treaty would be drafted during their time in office, and that it required London surrendering more national sovereignty to Brussels, a national referendum would be held on British membership in the EU.

The Conservative Party is largely Euroskeptic, and as such, would love to see a larger repatration of powers from Brussels. Many would go so far as to leave the EU altogether. Some in the party, like Mr. Cameron, are not Euroskeptics. He is not a Europhile in the same sense that politicians of continental Europe's center right parties are, like Merkel and Sarkozy, but he understands the benefits of British membership in the EU.

The treaty that Merkel, Sarkozy, and the rest of the EU were pushing for includes a financial transactions tax. This, argued Mr. Cameron, would hurt the United Kingdom disproportionately more than the rest of Europe. This is because London (the City to be more precise) is the world's biggest financial center. It is far bigger than any financial center in continental Europe. As such, the Conservatives deem this kind of tax to be a surrendering of national sovereignty to Brussels, and would thus trigger a national referendum that would, according to polling data for many months, most likely see the United Kingdom leave the European Union. Mr. Cameron wants to avoid that, and as such, used his veto on the proposed EU wide treaty. Meanwhile, the rest of the EU appears to be going ahead with this ""fiscal compact.""

This has several profound effects. Firstly, it displays just how little influence the United Kingdom now has in the European Union. Previously, it already had little influence in the Eurozone's affairs. Sarkozy famously told Cameron that ""He had lost a good opportunity to shut up"" in reference to the Cameron government's insistence on telling the Eurozone what to do despite being outside it. Historically, the UK has been the proverbial brake on European integration, and has found some allies within the Union with similar interests, mostly nordic countries like Sweden and Denmark. For many decades, the UK has pursued a policy of EU enlargement in an effort to dilute Franco-German power in the Union, since the UK itself is reluctant to embrace the European project in the same manner that France and Germany are. It now appears that the UK is utterly alone, and now has no leverage over the rest of the EU to pursue what the Conservatives want, which is a further repatriation of powers from Brussels. Politically, this development has shaken the governing coalition in the UK, which is composed of the Euroskeptic Conservatives, and the Europhilic Liberal Democrats as their junior partner. The leader of the Lib-Dems and the Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, is reported to be very angry with Mr. Cameron's decision. This issue could potentially cause more instability in an already awkward coalition of two very ideologically opposed parties.

Well, as I said: I don't give a damn about both Prussic and Danish imperialism and their wars... and neither about their insistence on Danish or German national states. Regional cultural identities are deeper than a couple of wars, and I bet Danes forced Danes into a war at some time or the other, too. At least Germans did.

The UK has long been resisting calls from other EU leaders for a Europe-wide bank transactions tax which it says would hit the City of London hardest. It is not thought such a tax was specifically discussed but Mr Cameron sought a separate legally-binding ""protocol"" to protect the City of London from more EU financial regulations.

true,atheistmil,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; This really negates the other monetary unions that work without a political union... CFA Franc, East Caribbean Dollar, CFP Franc, South African Rand

You've misunderstood several key factors about those currency unions. Firstly, all are pegged currencies and all are controlled by external central banks. Most of the African nations are either war-torn or piss poor and rely on international aid and few are so heavily involved in the global financial system. 

You're comparing apples to tables and wondering why they dont taste the same.

&gt; there is the assumption that the Euro caused the crisis or even made it worse.

It did, at least for Spain. Spain's effective interest rate was probably negative for most of the 00's, the interest rate set by the ECB was unsuited for the Spanish economy but was better for France and Germany.

Furthermore,  Greece would not have been able to get in to their current situation without the Euro, the interest rates they would have been paying would have shot up ages ago. The markets took the bet that Germany would not allow the Euro to break up and therefore Greek (and other) countries paid a lot lower interest rate than they otherwise would. 

Also, a massive devaluation of the Drachma would have helped them escape the crisis, it would have been a good example of the markets working as they should. Banks would have taken a massive hit and so they should. See Iceland, they had a crisis, devalued and the problem is working itself out.

&gt; I'm rather of the opinion that the Euro protected Greece from an even worse fate

To an extent with Greece you might be right, they would still be in trouble, they just wouldn't be in as much trouble because ultimately countries like Greece, Portugal and Ireland are small enough to be bailed out successfully by the IMF and their neighbours, Italy and Spain, if they had their own currencies could have used quantitative easing to hold down their debt costs as we have done in Britain. Remember we in Britain have much worse debt problems than Germany but our interest rates are below theirs.

Agreed, I wish we'd have a few more serious parties.

&gt; I don't see why a more federal model like ours can't be adapted to work in Europe. 

The main problem with this will be that it will be perceived as Germany dictating to the rest of Europe how to govern itself. Like it or not Germany as the biggest power in Europe will get the flak. We've already seen Greek protesters using unsavoury historical connotations. 

&gt; The solution to deficits in democracy would be to actually change things for the better 

i agree, but the EU has shown little appetite for doing the right thing, or even doing things for the better. Why the hell is CAP still around? Why does the EU move between Strabourg and Brussels every 6 months? Why did Germany and France ignore the Stability and Growth pact when it suited them and now acts all upset when other countries did the same?

It wasn't that much of an oppressive presence like other super powers and had little interest in keeping them through force because it quickly realized its size vs. the world. No, it was all about trading and integrating indigenous people. If you can't beat them, fuck them.

Our people circumnavigated the globe and [discovered Australia](http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/03/21/us-australia-map-idUSSYD3449720070321) some 250 years before Cook. We established trading posts across Asia and in Japan. What this says about our culture is that we're not afraid of the dark.

It's not just our country that's old, our people are the most ancient in Europe ([we hold the most ancient European genetic ancestry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_history_of_Europe)) and even cultural diversity shows that we assimilated some of those peoples traits and did it not by sword but through cooperation. 

Also, there is evidence Portugal was the birthplace of the Celts (still controversial) and even today some places in Britain are much closer genetically to Portugal than to any northern European.

Now, all this self promotion means nothing but one thing to me. When shit hits the fan, there's at least a couple things I'm pretty sure won't change - the Brits ain't going nowhere and neither are we.",0,1323689810,null,0,false,0,c37c43n,t3_n8ep3,t1_c37c43n,t1_c375xe7,1428009201,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,belgianguy,BELG,Belgium,"Well I guess one could call this the dark side of social media. While Twitter et al. shined with their liberating good side, (e.g. providing oppressed people with information they could not spread or obtain otherwise due to dictatorships or other malicious practices) the lack of content control and quality control can *also* induce panic runs because of it. In no way am I advocating that these measures should be implemented, I just want to highlight that it's inherent to the structure of certain social media.

The sensitivity to monetary matters is always rather high, couple this with bad memories dating back to 2008 and reports of other banks going under and it's not hard to envision that the dial was close to the dark red on the panic scale already. 

Then some well-crafted flurry of rumours about another bank going under can push a whole lot of people right into panic mode real quickly. As the panic kicks in, they probably retweet it to all their followers and leave to get their savings from the bank. Even the more skeptic persons might have seen the tweets and ignored them at first. But if the news starts showing people getting their money from the banks, they'll too get the uneasy feeling that there might be some truth to the messages they first ignored and get their money from the bank *just to be sure*, and thus might get swayed by something that is in essence nothing more than a self-fulfilling prophecy.

And it could very well last quite long, as people rather believe something their friends tell them than what the TV/radio/newspaper reports, because the latter could be in cahoots with the banks, conspiracy theories might surface and cause the real truth to become buried under the massive trending of the false topics. They'd have to wait until the false topics stop trending for the truth to appear, after which the damage probably will already be done.

Now Latvia wasn't really in the eye of the storm, but if such a stunt was pulled in Greece or Italy, the effects could well be disastrous. I just hope this wasn't a testing ground for more social media mayhem, or we're back to the ""Forward this letter to ten people or you'll die"" chain-letters of the 90's (or the 00's analogical YouTube comments).

The stuff you learn on a Hauptschule is only a fraction of the stuff you learn on a Realschule and of course a even smaller fraction of the stuff you learn on a Gymnasium. Teachers think that people who went on a Realschule don't need English at all. 

I learned to use the English language in my 11. grade where we started to work with real English texts from ""The Guardian"" or other magazines or news papers and not the stuff made for English lessons. Actually, I learned most of my knowledge about the current problems we have in my English lesson. I had to learn new words on my own and I had to learn how to understand a text and how to work with a text on my own as well. The teacher was only there for first aid and speaking was something I learned by doing presentations in class about a currently important topic. The teacher was great but he lived in the UK for years so he knew how he can teach us the most important thinks for the English language. Actually, because of him a lot of other people think I'm a Brit or went to an English school because I copied a lot of his accent. But this is an exception. A lot of my friends had teacher in the ""Oberstufe"" who just went on with the stuff our Realschul-teacher did and this is pretty useless because the only think you learn with teacher like this is how to not fail in class tests.

I think this would be the fact as well when your son goes to high school. Maybe not on a Gymnasium but maybe in a Realschule and the chances are even higher on a Hauptschule. If you're lucky, the English teachers changed but I don't think this would happen.",0,1323697486,null,0,false,0,c37cknt,t3_n8h93,t1_c37cknt,t1_c37c2jx,1428009408,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

Ive been living here for 4 years and I love the French for their ""Aperos"". These are short (or long) hang outs over drinks. Either at a bar or at someones house. And this is in the evening after work.

And this is across all social classes. Everyone does these Aperos.

This I figured was not so easy in America where, when I was living there, we worked longer hours. Here on the other hand where I work, on almost every Friday we finish an hour early, head to the meeting room and crack open a few beers and end the week. I get to go home really peaceful, the stress of the week long gone and Im 100% with my wife and son. This was not possible in America where my boss could call me when ever he choose to. In France my boss apologizes to me for disturbing me during the weekend (took me a while to get used to that). And in the last 4 years he has called me 3 times, once offering to give me a day off since I spent &amp; couple of hours on a Saturday morning - that blew my mind.

I also find people inviting us and us inviting people over more often here than we did in the states. And my neighbors are always sending us food.

true,yannickmahe,FRAN,France,"Effectively, this summit has laid the groundwork for future help. Basically, there were three main obstacles to massive help :

* The slow pace of the diplomatic process. The British demanding to be in discussions while not intervening, as well as blocking further integration was one part of that.
* German demanding massive fiscal reform before intervening
* The absence of political will and leadership over the player with the possibility to help : the ECB.

Problem 1 was ""resolved"" in that the next discussions will not include the UK, therefore make it more likely for the fiscal union to be able to move forward. In effect, separating those that want more integration from those that don't makes future integration much easier.

Problem 2 was resolved by the treaty in itself : now that serious rules are in place to ensure this problem won't happen again, Germany will be much more willing to help out.

Problem 3 was sidestepped by inventing the [EMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Stability_Mechanism) and political leaders going ""wink wink nudge nudge"" towards the IMF and the ECB.

This is why, unlike other summits, everybody is at least fairly happy with the results. Cameron and the UK win, Germany wins, and other EU members win.

true,boq,BAVA,near Germany,"It’s time to start calling the current situation what it is: a depression. True, it’s not a full replay of the Great Depression, but that’s cold comfort. Unemployment in both America and Europe remains disastrously high. Leaders and institutions are increasingly discredited. And democratic values are under siege.

On that last point, I am not being alarmist. On the political as on the economic front it’s important not to fall into the “not as bad as” trap. High unemployment isn’t O.K. just because it hasn’t hit 1933 levels; ominous political trends shouldn’t be dismissed just because there’s no Hitler in sight.

Let’s talk, in particular, about what’s happening in Europe — not because all is well with America, but because the gravity of European political developments isn’t widely understood.

First of all, the crisis of the euro is killing the European dream. The shared currency, which was supposed to bind nations together, has instead created an atmosphere of bitter acrimony.

Specifically, demands for ever-harsher austerity, with no offsetting effort to foster growth, have done double damage. They have failed as economic policy, worsening unemployment without restoring confidence; a Europe-wide recession now looks likely even if the immediate threat of financial crisis is contained. And they have created immense anger, with many Europeans furious at what is perceived, fairly or unfairly (or actually a bit of both), as a heavy-handed exercise of German power.

Nobody familiar with Europe’s history can look at this resurgence of hostility without feeling a shiver. Yet there may be worse things happening.

Right-wing populists are on the rise from Austria, where the Freedom Party (whose leader used to have neo-Nazi connections) runs neck-and-neck in the polls with established parties, to Finland, where the anti-immigrant True Finns party had a strong electoral showing last April. And these are rich countries whose economies have held up fairly well. Matters look even more ominous in the poorer nations of Central and Eastern Europe.

Last month the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development documented a sharp drop in public support for democracy in the “new E.U.” countries, the nations that joined the European Union after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Not surprisingly, the loss of faith in democracy has been greatest in the countries that suffered the deepest economic slumps.

And in at least one nation, Hungary, democratic institutions are being undermined as we speak.

One of Hungary’s major parties, Jobbik, is a nightmare out of the 1930s: it’s anti-Roma (Gypsy), it’s anti-Semitic, and it even had a paramilitary arm. But the immediate threat comes from Fidesz, the governing center-right party.

Fidesz won an overwhelming Parliamentary majority last year, at least partly for economic reasons; Hungary isn’t on the euro, but it suffered severely because of large-scale borrowing in foreign currencies and also, to be frank, thanks to mismanagement and corruption on the part of the then-governing left-liberal parties. Now Fidesz, which rammed through a new Constitution last spring on a party-line vote, seems bent on establishing a permanent hold on power.

The details are complex. Kim Lane Scheppele, who is the director of Princeton’s Law and Public Affairs program — and has been following the Hungarian situation closely — tells me that Fidesz is relying on overlapping measures to suppress opposition. A proposed election law creates gerrymandered districts designed to make it almost impossible for other parties to form a government; judicial independence has been compromised, and the courts packed with party loyalists; state-run media have been converted into party organs, and there’s a crackdown on independent media; and a proposed constitutional addendum would effectively criminalize the leading leftist party.

Taken together, all this amounts to the re-establishment of authoritarian rule, under a paper-thin veneer of democracy, in the heart of Europe. And it’s a sample of what may happen much more widely if this depression continues.

It’s not clear what can be done about Hungary’s authoritarian slide. The U.S. State Department, to its credit, has been very much on the case, but this is essentially a European matter. The European Union missed the chance to head off the power grab at the start — in part because the new Constitution was rammed through while Hungary held the Union’s rotating presidency. It will be much harder to reverse the slide now. Yet Europe’s leaders had better try, or risk losing everything they stand for.

And they also need to rethink their failing economic policies. If they don’t, there will be more backsliding on democracy — and the breakup of the euro may be the least of their worries.

""and a proposed constitutional addendum would effectively criminalize the leading leftist party.""

This is the biggest grudge of the source. A law academic in the US thinks she knows anything about Hungarian politics, and adds up issues from apparently one source. That source, obviously a Hungarian, is from the said ""leading leftist party"". This writing is biased, biased to that ""leftist"" political side. A lot of other points are based on bent facts, but lets stick with this one.

Here are some points to that one:

1. The MSZP is the legal continuation of the old communist party. It inherited all the assets of the communist party. There was even a court trial, which they have won, so they could take the assets of the communist party.
2. ""would effectively criminalize"". This is a classical twist of words. The constitutional addendum is specifically for the officials of the communist era. To say that it ""criminalizes"" a ""party"" (or even their voters), is a lie.
3. The MSZP is hardly the ""leading"" and is hardly ""leftist"". Its a group of post-communists, who have inherited wealth from the communist era, have made fortunes during privatization, and managed to get away with crimes. All that was ""leftist"" during their rule, was that they indebted the country, and spent the money on state workers benefits, and on themselves. My guess is that the source was related to this party, especially because of the ""the leading"" adjective, the writer tried to attach. MSZP is constantly losing support, in part to a new liberal party. The demonified Fidesz made more leftist moves that the MSZP ever made. All MSZP did, was to support big finance, and it still does that. To sell out state property. To put the Hungarian (a NATO country's) secret service under Russian influence.
4. The MSZP will be cleaned out of Hungarian politics. They can go to their old contacts to spread lies, but this process is inevitable. I don't agree to speeding up this process by finally making them accountable for what profit did they make from their communist past. The complete political system will push them out anyway. Their voters are the old communist believers, those who were made to believe in the system, like a religion. Those old voters are dying out, the MSZP's voter base is getting older. Their place will be taken by new political forces. It will be to the benefit of the leftist political side if that corrupt party is finally gone, and something new can take its place.

true,khthon,PORT,Portugal. Exit. EU. NOW.,"It's not insecurity but to you it may seem insecure of me to deny it.

It's a mere cultural trait. Given our history and knowing our traditions and idiosyncrasies, like most people, we're just a unique blend. That particular trait has its roots in our Arab/Jewish past (before we reconquered the peninsula). The religious traditions of hospitality run deep to this day and people just need like to make others feel welcome as if there were a defining social score being kept. Its really annoying at times. For example, whenever I go anywhere, the hosts are always asking if I need anything, if I want something, if I'm enjoying things. During the holidays its nearly impossible to go anywhere without lengthy conversations, food and drink being offered. It's also bad manners to refuse. So, expect formalities.
this also explains why there are so many more coffee shops and restaurants per capita than in Europe. 

Some of us are also prone to exagerations and drama. We like to grieve and to constantly complain. Even our national music genre - Fado, is a clear giveaway of just that. But in all this appetite for emotions, some good things can come of it, sometimes we can really exceed ourselves and surprise everyone. We're also generous to charity. The downside is that same emotional instability pervades everything in our society.

Two years ago I would have called you ""stupid"" for thinking the Euro isn't the greatest thing since sliced bread. There are so many known benefits. One of them (touted at the beginning) was that they would protect us from financial markets. Now they (politicans) tell us that the Euro is suddenly in danger because one country can't pay it's debts. So while I still think the Euro has a net benefit for the European public and respectfully disagree with your ""feelings"" for the English pound I must say I have been humbled greatly.

I disagree. With large infrastructure projects for example, the long term benefits are usually known before construction even starts. That's what encourages people to build them in the first place.

Has the banking industry in any country contributed at all? If you take into account the bailouts I don't believe they have. After all it is a big casino. The investment banks that is. And because they seem to be biggest in the UK, they have alse taken the larges chunk out of the UK. You call them ugly, because they are.

 &gt;&gt;   You are completely overstating the possible effects of this tax. It's not going to cripple Britain financially in any way. Why on earth would you think so?

&gt; Except that it will. Since the financial sector is huge in Britain, the majority of EU money from that tax will come from Britain

I didn't know that the Tobin tax would be something the EU would get. I am really not sure that is how it's supposed to work. The Tobin tax is pretty much a goner anyways. If (and that's a big if) it were ever to see the light of day in any country I seriously doubt that it would flow directly into the coffers of Brussel. As it stands now it would be introduced in continental Europe and if your calculations are correct all trade would move to London and it would benefit London greatly. 

I am not so sure about any of that though. If the trading would really move and if moved trading would really benefit the place it went to. Because we have seen how much benefit we get with the unregulated banking sector. Right now it threatens to sink not only our economies, but also our democracies with it.

(Btw, I've never voted Tory in my life and don't propose to start.)

Have a look at this,

http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/government-budget

It's the UK Governent budget since 1995, apparently.

We can see that the UK had (from a German perspective) a bad 1995/1996 and 1996/1997, post the fall out of the ERM and all that but thereafter seemed to do quite well until 2008/2009.

In 2007, the UK had a sovereign debt of c. 40 % of GDP compared to the German one of  c. 60% of GDP.

That means it's fine for the UK to run a government deficit of more than 3%  from 2008/2009 to probably 2014/2015.

OK, our curent deficits are probably a bit excessive but life's not perfect.

Anyway, UK debt remains only about 60% of GDP while the German one is nearly 80% of GDP.

What this means is the terms of last weeks treaty, severe opprobrium for any deficit in excess of 3%, were fundamentally unsuited to a British context.

Maybe that's why the British civil servants, our own very most excellent Sir Humphreys, prevailed upon a tired and emotional David Cameron to walk out.

Which is only fair and good because the British economy is not and should not be run on a German model.

Have you had a look at the London skyline recently?

If so, you'll understand a bit fo this,

&gt; I do believe you're exaggerating.

And that is coming from the guy saying the Tobin tax might crash UKs economy...

I just said ""people are saying"" for a reason. Because I am not a doomsayer like that. But Michael Hudson is saying that. Michael Hudson is one of the few people predicting the 2008 crises and one of the even fewer people pinpointing pretty much the exact timeline, the circumstances and what has followed. And he has some dire stuff to say about what comes now (he is some economics professor from the US, who has been touring the media circuit following his sudden fame in connection with his predictions):

http://michael-hudson.com/2011/12/europe%E2%80%99s-transition-from-social-democracy-to-oligarchy/

&gt; Look, I want to be tougher on banks, okay? I want that as well!

&gt; But I don't want an ill-thought solution that would lead to us becoming financially damaged. I don't want my country to become collateral damage. Can we agree that that is a fair desire?

What kind of regulation is enough? We have done exactly nothing since 2008 other than giving a lot of money to the people that almost crashed our economies and asked them nicely not to do it again. And what did they do? They are coming back asking for more threatening to crash our economies even harder. I am not saying we should disown them all (even though they deserved it), because that wouldn't fly anyways. All I am saying is that maybe, just maybe, we should think at least of *some* regulation. Just a little more than the none regulation that we currently have. And it very likely won't be the Tobin tax anyways. Though we both don't have any idea if the Tobin tax will have a good or bad effect. It also depends on the amount. The theory is that markets work best, when they are the most fluid and have the lowest transaction costs. The Tobin tax would eliminate that by implementing a transaction tax and therefore not having almost none transaction cost for trading anymore. But the actual cost in dollar is just one little part of transaction cost. That is the cold, hard, truth. There is information cost as well. A lot of it. And most of it was/is still hidden. That is what hit us most. Because banks were trading happily and with almost zero cost and were buying garbage, because they didn't think about what they were buying/trading. So there was a much higher cost already. But it was hidden. And now the public has to pay that cost. We have to buy that garbage at 1000% or more of current market price or the banks fail. Will the Tobin tax help with that? Will garbage trading become less of a problem? Will banks realize the cost of not having enough information? I don't know. 

Personally I believe we should have not given them a dime in 2008 and just gone for the ride. We should have taken that 2000 trillion Euros that we spent on the bailout and just invested them directly into the economy. And I believe we would have been much, much better off.

Pretty much all major banking institution would have come crashing down. Proving my point that they don't add anything to the real economy, but are rather a cost (they are not the Romans!). Because they are all riding on thin air. Nothing more. They are given money by the central banks to distribute to the people. But instead they take that money and play with it. And they loose, all of them, because they simply inflate values and then calculate huge incomes off of inflated values. Other than that, there is not much, really. 

But that is what I personally believe. Might be that they have some form of contributing. But I don't think so. At least it hasn't been shown to me. 

All of that is pretty much irrelevant, if we can believe this guy (he is a Swiss investment banker):

Edit:

This is a very interesting Wikipedia article about the 2011 UBS rogue trading scanal:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_UBS_rogue_trader_scandal

Part of it says:

&gt; According to the Financial Times, and other sources, Adoboli is suspected to have used the fact that some ETF transactions in Europe are not issued confirmations until after settlement has taken place.[2] The exploitation of this process allows a party in a transaction to receive payment for a trade before the transaction has been confirmed.[22] While the cash proceeds in this scheme can not be simply retrieved, the seller may still show the cash on their books and possibly use it in further transactions.[22] The process of orchestrating fails to deliver trades may then be used in a carousel of transactions.[22][23] Unlike in the United States, no data about the volume of fails-to-delivers is available for Europe.[22][24] CNN and World Finance also stated that some banks have deliberately allowed certain levels of fails-to-deliver, as a method of ""dealing with financial stress"" so that between accounting cycles the value of securities sold, but not delivered, as well as the value of the cash booked, but not received can be reflected on the books.

That would mean that a bank can actually show money on their books for trades that they already lost on. So much for the lack of banking regulation. To be honest, this is just one more example where banks with huge trading volumes can artificially inflate their book value. And when their casino playing has them diving deeper in red ink than a smaller European country has GDP they could possibly still show balanced books thanks to (totally legal) accounting tricks such as the one mentioned above. And then everyone hopes that part of their trades will pay off a little more than currently expected so the ship won't sink for another quarter but rather throw off another round of huge bonuses. But if a lot of ships threaten to sink, the governments will thankfully come in and save the day. So the big guys like to join hands so that either none of them falls or all of them.

true,edsballs,null,null,"I would like to be honest about something, and it's a big elephant in the room. It's an unspoken factor which is deeply ingrained in the subconscious British psyche. It has only been brought to my immediate attention recently when speaking with some eastern European friends and watching the US financial news however. I have been warmed by the fact that it's not just us 'stupid Brits' who feel this way...

The war only ended 67 years ago. Whilst the German people have undoubtably turned a corner and emerged as one of the most progressive, strong and cool societies going... A lot of people aren't ready to have their economies and consequentially politics dominated by Brussels which in the last two years is now de facto Berlin.

Don't get me wrong I like Germany a lot, I have German friends and very nearly moved to Frankfurt a few years ago. I know there is no risk of the past horrors reoccurring but 67 years is not that long. 

We abolished slavery in the 1830s and if we are honest it is only now that we as a society are slowly starting to come round to the ramifications of the dispicable behaviour of our ancestors. Even if you go back 30 years you still had wide spread racist attitudes considered as being ok by and large. Societies take time to heal... I'm not suggesting that Germany sits in the naughty corner for 200 years but those horrors happened within a lifetime. 

If it wasn't because of the straight jacket of the euro there is no chance in hell that anywhere near 26 nations would have signed that treaty. It's also worth remembering that before the euro Germany was seen as the sick man of Europe.

Also I really don't get France's attitude. It baffles me. Germany is the country with the power, France is in a terrible position. I don't see how Sarkozy gets so much attention. Maybe I just don't like him? I like france a lot though so maybe.

All of these houses need to be replaced in about 20-50 years, making it an interesting task of relocating/rehousing millions and millions of people in major cities all over Eastern Europe, often housing third of the population (like is the case in Czech Republic, [3.5 million being housed in such buildings.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel%C3%A1k))

However, I do think that I have a reasonable argument which is thus: The money to run our societies is already out there. The boom-bust cycle is just the result of borrowing it from the rich instead of taking it, because then you have to return it. So my proposal is that instead of asking the rich for their money and then giving it back to them with interest, to take some of that money with taxation and use it in our societies. 

&gt; Also, how on earth, are you going to get China, Japan, US, Canada etc to obey, and not make money out of it?

That's a good point. Obviously, if everyone plays greedily in this scenario you end up with Europe losing money and the others profiting from it. But that's like saying that if one country unilaterally outlaws slavery, then all others will profit from the extra workforce while that country's economy suffers. Clearly, sometimes it is possible to get countries to cooperate for some joint good. 

&gt; Please explain en economical/financial terms exactly how this tax is going to get rid of youth unemployment in Spain, global warming, corruption in southern Italy, etc

Youth unemployment can be combated by providing paid apprenticeship positions and investing money in business plans young people with no capital come up with. Global warming can be partly combated by investing in alternative technologies. Corruption can't be healed with money, unfortunately. I do agree that when it comes to implementing specific plans you need to decide them as scientifically as possible, but I think my idea has a strong rational basis which should be enough for the beginning? 

&gt; Sweden have tried, why not listen to us and our finance minister, we have better numbers than most of you. 

You talk a lot about science but this is a single data point. You can't really conclude from Sweden's example that a tax on financial transactions in impossible. Under different circumstances, for example, a different framework or scale or specific parameters, it could well work. 

&gt; We did not fuck up

The fact of the matter is that everyone fucked up, when we decided to open up our economies so much without providing some more integration. The inconsistencies and imbalances caught up with us all and I really don't think this is simply the fault of the debt-stricken countries. 

I don't like the fact that the EU is becoming less democratic any more than you do and I realise this is one of the problems.

true,Kim147,UKGB,United Kingdom Thanks,"The EU is accepted piecemeal by most of the EU countries including France . 

France does not accept the single market if it doesn't suit it - just look at what it does over Internet gambling for a classic example - Euromillions in other countries cannot trade in France . Internet gambling sites have to get special permission from the French authorities to trade in France irrespective of which EU country they are based in .

Then look at contractors and consultants - small business people - most EU countries do not allow these businesses to operate out of their home countries - they have to arrange for their staff to work via umbrella companies in the particular country where they are working . This , in practice , is irrespective of how short or long they are working in that country and where they reside in and where they will locate after the job is finished and , for that matter , where they will retire to .

Britain has abided by far the most to EU legislation , stupidly so it can be argued .

true,Norrsken,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;It's hard to have papers available that tell you stuff about large scale economics, simply because it's hard to create meaningful experiments that deal with these complexities. 

Well, that 's why we have scientist, since everyone can't be an expert on everything. I's say that most economics scientist are against, it, but the Eurozone is arguing for. Would you do that with other scientists? Claiming that doctors are wrong, chemists don't know what they are talking about. Admittedly, social sciences are more difficult to predict but that doesn't mean we can't. So, basically you and the Eurozone are ignoring what science say because of faith. And, yes, experiments has been done and they didn't turn out well. 


&gt;    Also, how on earth, are you going to get China, Japan, US, Canada etc to obey, and not make money out of it?
That's a good point. Obviously, if everyone plays greedily in this scenario you end up with Europe losing money and the others profiting from it. But that's like saying that if one country unilaterally outlaws slavery, then all others will profit from the extra workforce while that country's economy suffers. Clearly, sometimes it is possible to get countries to cooperate for some joint good. 


Second, you can't ignore the fact that China, Canada, etc are not playing with Merkozy. You have to solve that first, or the trading will just move. China is not lying awake thinking of the greater good of Europe


You are saying taxes=good. That is simply not true, not at all. There are a million scenarios when this doesn't hold true, more often than not I'd say. You are also saying that all of a sudden that all of the Eurozone, that up until know have behaved irresponsibly, all of a sudden would turn around and act like selfless, good people, just wanting to help. That is the most unlikely scenario I've ever heard about. So, Italy is going to be free from corruption from now on. No more billions down the drain?



    &gt;We did not fuck up

The fact of the matter is that everyone fucked up, when we decided to open up our economies so much without providing some more integration.


But *we* said no to the level of integration. Please, point out where Sweden fucked up our finances so much that we have to give up our right to independence. *You* integrated. *You* didn't solve the underlying issues beforehand. *You* overspent - Sweden didn't. 


That doesn't mean that we are not willing to help, but it should be in a manner of our own choosing, not being bullied into imposing taxes that we have tried and rejected. 



&gt;I don't like the fact that the EU is becoming less democratic any more than you do and I realise this is one of the problems


This is the worst. If I may quote Benjamin Franklin:

They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety



The EU started as a democratic union, to end wars. Now it has become an undemocratic monster, who is willing to trade in freedom and democracy rather that face problems themselves are responsible of creating. Democracy is not a little thing, it is *the* thing. We said No to the Euro and every single country in the Eurozone (apart from Finland) is more corrupt than we are. Merkozy do not care about the Swedes, you just want our money and you are certainly willing to trade in issues like democray and freedom to get that. I am sorry, those issues happen to be important to us, and I do not want to be part of an union(in this case the Eurozone) that so easily gives that up. I don't think anyone should be who belives in democracy.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Oh, so it is just German and French banks? What happened to the bad loans held by British banks? When you include obligations of the financial institutions, the British GDP to debt ratio is far by far the worst in Europe, rivalled only by Japan.

The amount of bad loans made to Southern European nations by French and German banks dwarfs the exposure of British banks to same said nations.  Once you understand this, the amount of squirming that the French are doing, trying to stop Germany from pushing haircuts for private lenders, becomes perfectly lucid.

&gt; But I guess that doesn't fit in the world view of a country that still dreams in terms of an empire.

true,AgentOfMisdirection,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Christ knows what will happen if Scotland goes down an independent path and there's two tier financing in Europe with the rest of the UK not transferring powers.

Personally I'm all for the Union between Scotland and the rest of the UK but if Scots decide for themselves that they want to tread another path then that must be recognised.  Problem being can Scotland afford to buy back autonomy of its banks? And if they do go down the independence route and negotiate their own entry into Europe as a separate entity a lot of finance jobs are going to go South of the border.  They'll have to.

My concern this time is genuine for Scotland.

&gt; Tuesday's plenary debate saw MEPs unleash much of the pent-up anger about what many politicians in Brussels see as Britain's permanently lukewarm view of the EU.

Well, when we repeatedly get screwed by the EU (see above), can you really blame us for being less than enthusiastic about the EU? The EU as an ideal is great, but as in practice it has been largely disappointing.

EDIT: Found [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_rebate) on the rebate:

&gt; The UK made CAP reform a prerequisite of removal of the rebate, a proposal their opponents rejected. The negotiations thus ended without an agreement being reached. In December 2005 the UK Prime Minister Tony Blair agreed to give up approximately 20% of the rebate for the period 2007-2013, on condition that the funds did not contribute to CAP payments, were matched by contributions from other countries and were only for the new member states. Spending on the CAP remained fixed, as had previously been agreed. Overall, this reduced the proportion of the budget spent on the CAP.
