Si c'est le cas, je te conseille d'élargir tes horizons et te voyager un peu: Paris, Marseille, Cannes, Toulouse, Nancy, Grenoble, Strasbourg... on dira ce qu'on voudra à propos de la SNCF, ça reste un excellent moyen de rapidement voir la France pour pas trop cher si on s'y prend bien.

SecondSilencer a déjà établi une bonne liste de choses à faire. 

Si tu es à Lyon en Juin/Juillet, les nuits de fourvière sont excellentes, et je te conseille d'en profiter plus que d'une fois!

De ce que j'en ai entendu dire, le musée des confluents est pas mal.

Le vieux lyon est sympa à explorer, et tu as aussi tout le quartier de St Jean avec la basilique de Fourvière, etc.

Enfin, il y'a les monts du lyonnais autour, avec plein de randonnées très sympa. Si tu peux trouver un petit groupe de gens avec qui t'organiser pour ça, c'est le top.

Personnellement j'aime aussi beaucoup le parc de la tête d'or et la cité internationale pour les journées glande estivales.

true,starbuckzero,BAVA,Bayern,"Not much, really. While the NBA is probably the most popular / well known of the 4 big American leagues in Germany, basketball is still an niche nowadays, especially since there hasn't been any ongoing TV coverage on public channels (and even on PayTV) for years. This used to be different in the 90s, at least I remember more of my peers were interested in basketball back then and there were weekly NBA shows.

There's the regular articles mentioning Dirk and the Mavs on the big online news sites since the playoffs have started, but usually they are in the ""mixed sports"" section next to other sports only few people care about, like tennis, athletics and golf. There might be a bit more attention if the Mav reach the finals, especially since football (soccer for you) season will be over by then, but even in 2006 when they were in the finals there was only little coverage. 

Sadly the only sports most Germans care about, are football and Formula 1, then there's a big gap before winter sports like skiing and biathlon, handball and maybe hockey (though even with the German national team doing really well in the world cup a few weeks ago hardly anyone noticed).
I'm a big NFL fan myself and i regularly follow the NBA during playoff season and there's hardly anyone to talk about around here. ",0,1306048477,null,0,false,0,c1vd2vz,t3_hh21o,t1_c1vd2vz,t3_hh21o,1427169891,12,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,12

If you go through a legitimate real estate company you will probably pay almost one month rental in agency fees.

Bring as much documentary proof of income/ability to pay as possible, photocopies of ID etc. Some landlords will request 3 months security deposit. This is **illegal** as the law changed well over a year ago. One month's SD is all they're legally allowed ask for. They will also request a ""garant"" somebody who will garauntee to pay your rent if you default on rent payments.

You don't say how long you are intending to be here, or if you are already here and working/studying.

Word of mouth is one of the best ways to find an appt. ask in anglophone bars for help. I live in a two room appt in Vincennes and I only pay €550 with utilities included (but that is an exceptionally good deal and my rent has not increased in the last four years). I have no rental contract and I pay in cash, oh and my landlord is a member of the French equivalent of the US SWAT I kid you not.

I'm not going to pull any punches and I don't want to discourage you, but finding an appt is really difficult for non-French people without a full-time job. But as evidenced by my situation you can strike lucky.

Your budget of €1000 p/m is reasonable. Try the 18th, 19th and 20th arrondisements as well as they are currently the cheapest.

Regarding minerals, my only direct source is http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/027ns_005.htm (the original article is apparently behind a paywall, here http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19426051.200-earths-natural-wealth-an-audit.html)

Also the mere impression from spiking resource prices. And political tensions of Europe and China over the latter's possible limits on exports of Rare Earth Minerals sometimes seen in news articles.

Two that specifically worry me are indeed food/water and energy. On the latter, its not that I think we lack solutions (better recycling is a 'solution' to the above too, up to some distant size at least - until the ultimate solution of asteroid mining), just that jumping from mere existence of a technology (or technologies) to a viable (including politically viable, in case of fission) large-scale deployment (with acceptable reliability and stability) is no trivial matter, and unrolling it needs sufficient will and time (and indeed - resources). Not so sure we're scoring great in either.

We're obviously also not scoring brilliantly in transferring food surpluses of the west to the ppl either starving or impoverished and without perspective because they must expand all their effort to avoid starvation. And a third is hardly enough anyway to cover both still rising population and one would hope rising standards, up to something like western levels.

All this doesn't instill confidence in me that we can manage say an &gt;9billion ppl world, esp presuming a desirable level of development and hence consumption of most of them (unlike now).

EDIT: oh, and to clarify; I don't really think having *shrinking* populations like Europe does is great either, for economic reasons, though aren't sure if this is the greater issue, and in any case a good *social* case can be made for neutralizing the economic burden of having kids so I don't disagree with measurements you propose really, except actually advocating more kids:)

Case in point: Many years ago myself and my American girlfriend, who I will call T, were invited to spend a weekend in Rath Cairn in Co. Meath.

My friend's girlfriend, who I will call C offered to drive us there. On the way there C only spoke in Irish to me, ignoring my girlfriend completly, while I tried my best to include T in the conversation. I was livid at the insult. In the house we stayed in girls and boys had seperate sleeping quarters even though myself and T were living together at the time.

So, anyway, out we go to the local community/cultural center and me and T tried to have a good time but she was excluded from conversation. Next morning after breakfast she asked me to talk to her outside the house. She told me that when they got back to the girl's quarters she could hear the other girls talking ""as Gaeilge"" and she heard her name being used in their jokes and comments amid much laughter.

I was absolutely furious at the lack of respect and welcome shown to T, after all, I had known this family for many years. One of their daughters has appeared many times on Irish TV programmes as a presenter. We packed our bags and got on the next available bus back to Dublin.

I have not had any contact with that family since.

2. Wie erwähnt - und von dir ignoriert - sind das *nur* die Kosten für Deutschland aus den *EU-Rettungskrediten* an Griechenland. 

Die gesamte Verschuldung des Landes, d.h. auch die bei IWF, EZB, Banken, Privatanlegern etc., beträgt cr. €320 Mlrd. (und steigend). Ohne weitere Beihilfen von mindestens 12 Mlrd. wird es bis [Mitte Juli zahlungsunfähig](http://www.finanzen100.de/nachrichten/athen-hat-noch-geld-bis-18-juli_H2064178976_1-1-19370/)

Diese Zahlen für den griechischen Geldbedarf wurden am 10. Mai vom Wall Street Journal veröffentlicht:

&gt;The Problem: The €110 billion EU-IMF bailout is not enough money for Greece. It never was. The original bailout math in May 2010 showed Greece would need €53.2 billion to cover deficits, €88.3 billion to repay existing long-term debt and €10 billion to prop up banks through mid-2013. That’s €151.5 billion. To plug the hole, the EU presumed Greece would borrow more than €40 billion from private markets.

&gt;The numbers have only gotten worse. In the most recent analysis, the EU added €4.9 billion to the deficits that will need to be financed. The current estimate is €44.1 billion in long-term borrowing to fill the gap, of which €26.7 billion should come in 2012. Almost no one believes Greece will be able to raise that much money; currently, markets want more than 15% to lend to Greece, and S&amp;P rates its bonds deep in junk territory

If the line it's too old to achieve full speed, you can request a ""naked ADSL"", they basically lay a new data-only cable from the DSLAM to your house.

If you want to stay in the city, you should check out the Arena, an ancient arena in the center of the city, similar to the Colosseo. If you're a fan of Opera or classical music, check out the program for the day you're there. You can find it [here](http://www.arena.it/en-US/HOMEen.html).

The rest of the old city center is really beautiful, and there are many good restaurants there, only avoid those directly in front of the arena, they are tourist traps.

If you want to go out of the city and visit the surroundings, there are many beautiful places a few kms from Verona.

I highly suggest (if it's a sunny day) to visit the [Sigurtà Park](http://www.sigurta.it/index.php), it's a beautiful botanic park overlooking the river Mincio. 
Another possibility if you want to stay out of town is to visit the Garda lake and its surroundings. Little towns like Peschiera, Desenzano, Bardolino are really beautiful and relatively close to Verona.

Actually, I think I was wrong above and it's the same for a permanent residence permit in Germany (without EU). I.e., it's not five years of legal residence, but five years of paying into the social insurances. Any legal residence counts for the eight (seven with an integration course) years towards citizenship, though, you just mustn't rely on welfare during that time.

Talking to the university is excellent advice. AFAIK, whether they accept credits is up to them, so they're obviously the right people to talk to.

Regarding dual citizenship with the US, some high income earners give it up because the US taxes citizens abroad for what they make above $96k or so.

The term comes from the Arabic dating back to the Crusades when the Arabs and much of the Levant called **ALL** Europeans Franks. The Greeks would later adopt the term as it became ubiquitous but that has happened much later in the 17th century.

The Greeks never saw Europe as a West and East. This concept is a fairly modern understanding that has its roots from Western barbarian tribes (like the Franks) who inherited the western part of the Roman Empire and were culturally, politically and socially rejected by the the Eastern ""rehellenized"" Roman Empire that we now often call Byzantium, a big separation that was further increased with the rise of the Muslim Ottoman Empire.

And while their payout is somewhat affected by the negotiated rent, the trouble to change that is simply not worth it for them. They are much more interested to get it over with fast. To be able to do that they need to present a good tenant - and that is a person who pays his rent on time and doesn't cause trouble with them or the neighbours. To offer more rent could be seen as a trick to get around that and it might be understood as an indicator of a questionable character. At least that is how I would see such an offer - and I do have some say over new tenants in my familys houses in Berlin.

true,nicasucio,null,null,"I don't know who told you that atms are the worst way to exchange money, but that is a complete misconception.

ATM's could give you a better rate, depending on the bank you have or the country you're in.

For example...you're going to France and England---Bank of america has a deal with Barclay's in England, and  Fortis bank in france so that if you withdraw money from their atms using your bank of america ATM card, you get no extra charges.

 However, do be aware that bank of america has one of the lamest exchange rates.  For example, taking today's exchange rate of 1 dollar = 0.62 pounds, bank of america would give you something like 1 dollar = .52 pounds.   A very expensive rate.   Just using that as an example, but BofA has bad rates.  But because you're actually getting no fees when using the ATM, the exchange rate might work out.

Example, Wachovia charges 5 dollars per transaction at foreign atms, and they will give you 1 usd = 0.56 pounds, so depending on the amount you withdraw, you might come out losing or worse than BofA, or you might come ahead.

And again, because you're using Barclays, they do have a better rate than bank of america, (or they used to), so withdrawing from a barclays atm in london using a BofA card, might be the best deal.  

What i used to do when traveling to europe is call the banks that you have and ask them, if i were to exchange 100 dollars today into euros, how much would you give me; they will quote you a number, look at today's exchange rate, and see who has the best rate.  The more money you exchange, the better the rate.  

Also, sometimes a bank will give you a better rate if you do exchange the money in the usa, but again, that requires you to call and ask, or go in and ask, and then do know what the exchange rate of that hour is.  (as you know they change every minute)

And exchanging at the airport is the worse thing you can ever do.  One time i got stuck in spain and i had no money, and had to use one of those kiosks, and their rate was like 15 cents lower than the ongoing rate.  Freaking lame.   If you're going to do that, you're better off withdrawing from the atm.  

And beware of the pickpockets.  You see any kids coming to you with some lame ass sign to help the children, just keep on walking and ignore them.

The Pantheon is nice to look at.  The Castel Sant'Angelo was awesome (by the Vatican).  We stumbled upon a flyer for a party there and went that night.  Food, history, music, art, and some creepy stories.  Best night ever.  In the Vatican museum, avoid the new age/modern art section- bleh and sooo long.  You can't take pictures of the Sistine Chapel but it's pretty albeit packed.  The crypt for the popes is kind of weird, especially with John Paul II shrine/tomb thing which is likely to be popular since he was recently beatified.  

Florence: there's a piazza on the southern part of town (San Michele, I think) and tons of people go there to watch the sunset.  Amazing.  La Accademia was boring as hell because it was mainly a bunch of the same pre-Renaissance works.  The David is cool and there are the fugitives, but I wouldn't go again.  Anyway, for the Uffizi and the Accademia, get tickets and for the first of the day- saves time.

In Venice, go to some of the other islands.  I went to Burano and Lido, best decision ever.  There are small old gondolas that take you straight across the Grand Canal.  Scary as hell, but cheap and fun.  It was .50 and you had to stand.  

Naples: la Racchetta di Regina Margherita- best pizza ever and it's in the shape of a tennis racket.  The archeological museum that houses most of the stuff taken from Pompei is nice.  First time I went to Pompei I was pissed with all the signs that said that the stuff was at the museum.  Definitely go to the garden of the fugitives.  Pack water and sunscreen (it's sooo freaking hot).  Stay away from ginger soda unless you like cough syrup.  Take the boat ride from Positano to Amalfi.  The bus is too long and scary.

true,mrmdc,null,null,"*I started writing a reply, and I started wondering what you travel arrangements are. Do you have a car, or will you be travelling by bus/train?*

In **Florence**, I suggest you visit the Boboli Gardens (Giardini di Boboli), it's beautiful. Plus, it's behind the Pitti Palace, which in itself is very very nice to see. You can stop at a really nice little *Enoteca* right in front of the Pitti Palace. You can get a good glass of wine and a nice cheese platter. It comes with various jams, it's delicious. 

Anyway, getting back to the things to see... I suggest also going to Fiesole, you can get there by bus with ease.

Pisa... Meh... There's the Leaning Tower... That's basically it. Unless you're *really* keen on taking that stupid picture where you're holding it up, you can skip it. Spend time in Florence... Walk around. Go down all the streets, take in the city. It's magnificent.

Other things to see: Santa Croce Church (even just to look at the facade... it's a beaut'!). You can also walk through the leather market, San Lorenzo. There are several old churches in the area as well (one of them is where *I think* Lorenzo De Medici is buried. It was nice), and some cool (very) little museums. 

You *could* go to Piazzale Michelangelo, you have a very nice view of the city from above, but it's kinda far and there's nothing else to do there. 

You could also go visit the synagogue (it's one of the oldest and largest in Italy). When I was there they wouldn't let in non-jewish people... Only people there to worship were allowed. I don't know if that's still true.

Do you want info on nightlife? I can suggest a few places.

In **Siena** you must visit the Duomo (if only from the outside... I don't know your religious views or interests... though the churches are beautiful works of art if nothing else), the tower in the piazza, just walk around really... It's all beautiful. If you're there for the Palio. I mean... You *MUST* see that. It's amazing. The city comes alive. It gets jammed and factioned. It's amazing.

There's actually a determined route that's set up for historical sites in the city. There are brown signs you can follow and it takes through a historical sites route. The city is a big circle around the piazza where the Palio is held. It's actually kinda easy to get lost. But getting lost is the best part. It's really a beautiful city. Going up the tower is worth the wait and the effort, you get an amazing view at the top, and the climb is really nice (though scary if you're claustrophobic... there are very tight parts).

In **Verona**, the important things are the Arena and Juliet's house. You have to walk through the Arena, if there's a show that night and you have the time, watch it. It's an amazing experience. Walking from the Arena to Juliet's house, you will be walking through a pedestrian shopping street... It's pretty nice... At the end of that street you turn right to get to Juliet's house. In there, you have to take a picture of you grabbing Juliet's tit. It's a tradition. It's good luck. *But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.* There's a plaque with that on it. 

Once you get out of there, head back to that walking street but where you turned right to go to Juliet's house, go the opposite direction and walk around. There are several beautiful cafes and restos (pricey, but hey, you're in Italy, in Verona). *If you're Canadian*, look up, you might still see a Canadian flag wavering on someone's balcony. :P

In **Naples**, I mean, if you care for your life, avoid the city itself. It's looking bad right now. Take the ferry to Capri. Oh man... Capri...

In **Capri**, get off the ferry and walk around. You can go up the little sloped street on the right (from the port) and find a scooter rental place. That's an amazing experience. I'd never driven a scooter before... You can drive around the entire island, go to Anacapri. In Anacapri, you have to visit the San Michele church. It's floor is all hand painted wood. You can't walk on it. You have to walk on planks that snake around the walls. Go up and take a photo. It's nice. You should also , if there's a woman present, buy a pair of leather shoes (open shoes). They're always on the avant-garde of shoes. You can find some really nice sandals that look like an ancient Roman would have worn. They snake up your leg. They're very nice.

Make sure to go to **La Grotta Azzurra**. It's worth the wait, the price, the everything. Make sure it's a nice day when you go. Otherwise you won't be able to go in. If the waters are rough, boatsmen won't go in. If the sun isn't out, it's also not that nice. The sun is important. It's what cause the grotto to become illuminated.

*Note:* If anyone tells you go to in the water so they can take a photo of you with your friends/girlfriend in the water, don't do it. They WILL steal your camera and/or bags. wallet.

**Positano**, you don't really need to get out of te ferry here. Just look at it from the boat. It's very nice, but not much going on there. You can walk around the nice little streets, maybe swim at the little beach.

If you're doing this tour though, and you have a car that you left in Naples or something, make sure you time everything so you can get back to Naples. Because otherwise you have to take the latest ferry to Salerno, then take a bus back to Naples and find your way back to the port and/or your car.

http://blog.susobaleato.eu/2011/05/hemos-hecho-brillar-el-sol-hagamos.html

Lo de los valores me parece interesante, pero pienso que podría ser poco práctico puesto que si hay algo vinculado a los valores son precisamente las ideologías y las creencias; buscar un consenso de mínimos sobre un conjunto de valores es una tarea realmente complicada; aunque desde luego yo te animo a ello.

En mi caso, trato de ser algo más práctico (deformación profesional) por lo que he pensado en identificar las modificaciones al sistema que podrían ser compatibles con un mayor rango de valores (ideologías, creencias, culturas...) distintos. Están al final del post referido para quien tenga interés, pero basicamente son: 1. reforma del sistema electoral, 2. control de la financiación de los partidos y 3. un régimen de referendum más flexible. Con los dos primeros se resolverían la mayor parte de los demás problemas, y con el tercero se resolverían los restantes.

And in the last couple of months the big companies all offer data plans for the pre-paid sim cards.

If you don't use a blackberry it's cheaper with Yoigo, I can't remember the exact amount, but a person I know got a month's worth of Internet on his phone for less than 20€. But it didn't provide blackberry service although some of their personnel claim they do. This is a virtual network (retails other carriers signals) so don't expect much support from them.

With Orange you get unlimited data for 3,5€ per week (you have to pay a minimum 10€ for the line of which you get 6€ for whatever you want and 4 for voice calling).

true,thorva,TEXT,the immoderator,"Short answer: Yes, you certainly would. I teach and work on the periphery of admissions for a similar international master's degree at the HU Berlin. I have had a look at the website for this course, and my advice to you is this:

1) Your GPA will be the very most important thing. Sounds like yours is good, so that's a strong starting point. American universities are generally held in high regard, especially compared to Eastern European or west-Asian ones.

2) Very much will hang on the ""motivation letter"". Make it good, concrete, make sure it is grammatically correct, and avoid bullshit like how ""ready"" you are to ""broaden your horizons"" by studying abroad or some such crap. Every American writes that, and we get tired of reading it. Relate your concrete experiences to the demands made of applicants, and show in your letter of motivation how you fit the profile of the sort of student they're looking for. I cannot stress enough how important this bit is.

3) Talk to the people whom you are getting to write your letters of recommendation, and let them know that it's very important that they are (a) specific, (b) unequivocal in their praise, and (c) relate to your ACADEMIC achievements, not your extracurricular ones. If the first people you approach don't feel like they can write a letter like that, find someone else. I know at Humboldt we put very little stock in how friendly you were when giving guided tours for prospective students at your college, and I can't imagine Uni Leipzig is any different.

4) It says 'basic' German, and it sounds like you have that. Practice your comprehension with some free spoken-word media, like by watching videos on www.tagesschau.de or listening to Deutsche Welle podcasts. 

The only other less-than-immediately obvious thing I might point out to you is that for documents of which they require a 'certified copy', a notary public in the U.S. should be perfectly sufficient.

1. Phone. Don't know what kind of cellphone you have. Is it Skype enabled? There's an internet café just near MIJE on rue de Jouy, literally around the corner.

2. Money. Opening an account for just six weeks will be problematic. You will need to furnish all kinds of paperwork (proof of income and proof of domicile). Why do you need a bank account if it's only for 6 weeks? Doesn't seem worth the hassle to me.

3. There's a Franprix supermarket just around the corner on rue St Antoine for your basic needs. There's a really good resto [nearby](http://www.paris-bistro.com/choisir/paris4/bouquetsaintpaul.html), for cheap good eats try [l'as du falafel](http://travel.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/travel/31bite.html) and is recommended by Lenny Kravitz!

There's a [bar owned by a redditor nearby](http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Pure-Malt-Paris/10150145817775167) and a nice wee bar it is. Tell Shep you're a redditor!

Otherwise there's another [""Scottish bar""](http://www.theauldalliance.com/) bar near MIJE where I'm quizmaster on Mon nights. Drop in and ask for the quizmaster.

Cafés in Paris are not really the places to strike up conversations with strangers unfortunately.

4. Bicycles. I was given a bike by a neighbour when she left Paris. It's a woman's bike and has a puncture. If you want it you can have it. I've never used it.

5. Locals. Better to say ""Pourriez-vous me parler en francais s'il vous plait, car j'ai vraiment besoin de pratiqué mon français?"" A lot politer than ""Parlez-français s'il vous plait!""

6. Stories. I was out one night when I saw a camel, yes a real live fucking camel, being led up rue St Denis, well that's another story.

Check out the new /r/Paris FAQ for some more info and tips

You'll have a great time. MIJE is in a fantastic location.

There's a nice beach and lots of shopping if you're into that. Also, you can get to Porto in Portugal easily from Galicia--so GO! It's gorgeous. Travel around Spain, and be sure to hit up Leon and Oviedo. Do you speak Spanish? (It's not a requirement for the program, so I've gotta ask. It's important!) 

I used 'easypiso.com' to find my apartment and had pretty good luck. 

In regards to the program (I know you didn't ask so I won't tell you too much) but be sure to come with sufficient funds. It generally takes about 1.5-2 months to get your first paycheck and you'll have to pay rent a couple times, pay your housing deposit, transport etc with what you've got at home. The exchange rate isn't in your favor. ALSO. Make sure that your landlord is willing to give you a WRITTEN lease. It's required to get your residence card and a lot of people don't want to give it (because you need some of their personal info, and they have to claim the income). A couple people I know ended up having to move after a couple of weeks to find a place that'd give them one. Finally. getting your residence card takes a while--everyone gives you different directions and sends you to different places, at least here in Leon. So get started ASAP, since you must get it before your visa expires!

Rise we will and I promise I will stand and the forefront and shout with and for you too. But you, the Greeks, haven't learned the right lesson yet. You chose the elites who already before the elections promised to betray you the most... the elites who allowed corruption and wastage of money. The elites who promised to lower taxes and make everything even easier. And now, when you have the first leader that actually stands up for you, that is honest about the state of your country, then you don't even give him a chance to fix it.

I know things are not nice over there but you're not exactly trying... your country's problem is not one of politics. You country's problem is one of values and ethics. If [tax evasion](http://aleksandreia.wordpress.com/2011/05/14/tax-evasion-in-greece/) is done by everybody, what do you think your country finances the higher-than-elsewhere retirement money and wages from? Why do you have the largest civil service relative to the population? No, sorry, Greeks, you will have to fight yourself. That is, you won't have to fight your government, you will have to fight the ones among yourselves who messed up - everyone who didn't pay their share, everyone who didn't vote, everyone who asks for bribes. Those you need to call out. Against those you need to found NGOs and organisations; and shame them until it becomes a universal value and honour to do your share to save your country.

I know not all are guilty. But too many are - too many are guilty of silence, of seeing what happens and not saying no. I'm sorry for those that acted right, that paid their share, that fought against corruption and cronyism - but now is the time for the majority to stop hitting your own government, the first in twenty years that does not lie to you and does not betray you, and actually tries to help you. It is time to hit those of you that brought you in this situation and to stop hitting those that try to bring you out of it.

tl;dr: The Greek problem is not one of social justice, social rights, rights, equality, gender, politics or European pressure. The Greek problem is a failure of civil society, a failure of the majority of individuals to either act right or call out those that acted wrong.",0,1306312789,null,0,true,0,c1vwq6k,t3_hjbkf,t1_c1vwq6k,t3_hjbkf,1427179278,18,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,18

I do not think that US and the Iraq war is a correct analogy in this case.

The corruption/ethical flexibility/passive stance in greek society is an everyday thing, made worse by everyday decisions and attitude. ""Cutting corners"" is the rule and unfortunately the majority of the population has an part in this (direct or indirect). I can get into specific examples, but I think that this is beyond the point.

Nevertheless, that is why I honestly believe that the changes that are needed are much deeper than borrowing money from abroad (and definitely selling out all the country's wealth).

That is why I support that a well educated, ""awake"" society is the way to go. Let us not forget that the governments that fucked up my country did not elect themselves.

PS. I do not doubt that Greeks are hard workers. I know they are. Still, in a society that rarely awards hard work, there is a lot of ""wasted effort"". In systems that do not work, the amount of effort that is required to do simple things is amazing. I hope you get what I am trying to say.

Where I **strongly** disagree is your view of the current Greek government. The problem in Greece may be as you say a civil society failure, but it is deeply political as well.

Leaving aside the nepotism in Greek politics (the current Prime minister's father and grandfather have been prime ministers in the past), this guy got elected promising all those things the corrupt elite has promised over the years. As I said in [another comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/hjbkf/the_call_of_greece/c1vwssm) the current government got about 30% of the popular vote and had 160/300 seats in the parliament.

Since the austerity measures have been enacted, the government did absolutely nothing concrete to make the tax system more efficient, or more fair. On the contrary one of the measures was to raised the VAT twice, and they are going to do it again in the next few days.

But again, let us leave aside the micromanagement stuff. Greece has a debt problem. We are told we owe 160% of the GDP, which is about 350 billion euro. The first thought of the government was  ""hey, let's borrow some more money"", the second ""let's cut the wages and increase taxes"" and the third ""let's sell the public wealth"". The Greek people deserve, at the very least, to be told who holds our debt and where this money was spent.

the debt is a state debt, the state is the people. So the Greek people owe the money. Further, the money lent is paid by other European governments, who either take up debts or cut spending to finance it. That is, the taxpayers in other European countries pay for the debt in Greece, either by having to pay more themselves (tax increases) or a cut in (social) services.

Yes, the people in the rest of Europe pay for the Greek debt.

Also: America is fucked and it's everyone's fault. Europe is undemocratic and it's everyone's fault. Yes. Yes it is. That's why we don't need internet rants but activism.

(I assume you are Greek): What did you, personally, do to prevent this from happening? Nothing? Good, then it is your fault. It is the same fault of yours as it was for the Germans who voted for Hitler and allowed the Holocaust, or basically all countries in the world which allowed genocides in Armenia, Rwanda, and elsewhere. It is the same amount of fault (although obviously the guilt regarding genocide and holocaust is a lot bigger).

So, YOU as long as you didn't actively work to prevent something like this from happening in Greece, as long as you paid bribes and avoided taxes, or did not shame those that did so, and did not try to rise up against the institutional corruption and cronyism, it is indeed your fault.

The Greeks are Greece, as the US Americans are the USA. They might not all agree with what is done, but as long as they don't (at least try to) prevent it they share the burden of guilt.

PS The Norwegian, Swedish, German, Dutch, Polish, Hungarian, Italian, Spanish, Estonian (etc.) taxpayers are not against lending to Greece because they don't want their government to give money to others. They are because the feel cheated - that Greece overspent (the Greek people enjoyed the services and allowed the corruption that lead to overspending) but *they* will have to pay for it with higher taxes and less services.

In essence the countries you mentioned, loan money to Greece in order to pay the interests of previous loans to private institutions. 

So what these governments are doing is taxing their citizens in order to pay the banks, through Greece. This is not at all fair. In fact it is outrageous, but it is not the Greek people to blame here. Or at least the majority of the blame should not fall on them. It is the Greek government, that did not seek another solution to the problem, their own governments that agree to do this, and the banks themselves for doing crappy investments.

For one, Andalucia has historically been poor and unemployment has always been high because they rely so heavily on tourism for employment. That means everyone is out of a job once the summer is over.

Secondly, and this might be an unpopular opinion, the labor market is extremely rigid in Spain. The unions have a tremendous amount of control and they strangle employment. It's very expensive to hire someone in Spain, and so companies won't take the chance. This also contributes to nepotism, because if I'm going to spend a bunch to hire an unvetted worker, he may as well be family. One thing that isn't often reported is that there is a vibrant gray employment market (people hired under the table) and that's why even with 20% unemployment you don't have widespread protesting (15-M was close but no cigar).

Regarding Telefonica and other large Spanish multinationals: they get unfair treatment by the government. After Franco, large nationally owned companies like Telefonica were privatized. In an effort to make sure that foreign companies didn't come in and buy all the newly privatized infrastructure, the government approved certain subsidies and protections for these new companies. These protections exist to this day and create an anti-competitive environment. The companies essentially take the subsidies and then use them to lobby the government to keep the subsidies. Less competition usually means less jobs.

So what's the solution? There is no magic bullet, but Spain needs to modernize the way it does business.

If a construction company bids to build a road that costs 100 euros, it will make an offer for 300 euros. 100 (hopefully) will go to construct the road and the rest will be split among the company and the government officials that chose the specific company for the project. So instead of paying 150 euros (let's say that 50% is the profit of the company), we pay twice that. Now imagine this happening for the majority of public projects, from roads, to airports, to websites and software projects. The people responsible either have immunity (MPs, or ministers) or the judicial branch will not prosecute them. It is my impression that these two, military spending (which is itself subject to corruption as I described above) and project overspending are the two biggest contributing factors to the deficit. 

The problem is that cutting wages, improved very little the deficit problem. Also increasing taxes, and VAT especially will just result in less consumption, which will actually result in less income for the state.

To be absolutely exact, it's not three e-mail warning, it works like this :
 
1. You get caught for the first time, you receive one warning e-mail from HADOPI.
2. You get caught a second time **less than 6 month after receiving the warning e-mail**, you get a warning letter by snail mail.
3. If you're dumb enough to get caught a third time **less than 12 month after the snail mail**, you get a fine, and your internet should get restricted. I say ""should"" because nobody has ever got their line restricted, and it's not clear in which way it would be (it should let you access your e-mails but not much else).

The lack of any sort of political dialogue in the national psyche resulted in the same incompetent leadership that doomed Greece. For the most part, Irish people view politics and having political opinions distasteful, probably because of the troubles in Northern Ireland etc. This had resulted in a very attenuated political landscape where all parties are indiscernible from each other. The recently elected Fine Gael party has continued the policies of the ousted Fianna Fáil pretty much to the letter. For the moment people are expecting hat something different is going to happen.

Political corruption and cronyism is tolerated and deeply embedded in the culture. There were two major student protests that were quickly put down by armed police and followed with accusations of police brutality. Political corruption is never prosecuted, whistle-blower legislation has been promised by the current government but opposed by them when they were in opposition.

Yes and no, there are many who would disagree with all I've said above. This type of argument has been played out a few times on r/ireland. There are those who believe that a strain of negativity and pessimism ( such as I would be accused of ) affects many and what's needed is optimism, generally (in my opinion) this opinion is accompanied by a denial of corruption, or rather, a claim that similar levels of corruption exist elsewhere and that there is nothing unusual in the political corruption in ireland.

&gt;I guess in Germany its not that bad yet - but what I know for sure is: if we don't do something it will be soon!

It's the political apathy that has brought Ireland to where it is. The sources of that apathy are debatable but for myself I doubt they are to be found in many other places. I think it was caused by Ireland's traumatic history.

And FYI, even before the bailout they cut spending.

My mother is retired and has lost about 300€ just through tax increases this past few months.
And now they'll reduce her retirement about 10% too and increase taxes on her even more.

And lastly, our research is on different markets. We performed one on the youth market, now we are doing the affluent market and we will be doing two more. We gave away over 4,000 Euros two months ago specifically to (many) French citizens between the ages of 17-26 who make salary ranging from 0-2500 a month. Simultaneously we performed the same research and gave the same amount of money to the same market in Brazil...

Trust me I'd rather do a research project that helps all parties, but in this case as you would guess it's extremely hard to find a French affluent target group who would donate their time (much easier in US and Brazil though)...

Furthermore, everyone else (i.e. in the UK) is paying taxes through the nose to pay for their X.  You know, taxes good, because they pay for those roads, universal healthcare, public services, etc.  So when you go protest because you and your parents pay a ton of tax under the understanding that ""OK, we'll accept this because it will mean good railways, professional policing, welfare to make sure the downtrodden and unlucky don't get shunted aside, education for our children, etc."", and those get taken away, yeah, you'd be pissed, and rightfully so.  Because you're not getting what you pay for.  

Greece's case is different.  You can keep saying that everyone should be able to retire at 55 with full benefits, all public services should be free, we should be able to spend money on tons of public works projects, everyone should be able to do the jobs that they want, and a whole lot of other things.  But you have to be able to pay for that.

Please don't try to frame this as some sort of noble protest against the evil privatizers or nasty corporations.  Because that is not what it is.  Nor against a wonderful bit of solidarity among countries when one member just got a bit unlucky.  This is the result of laziness and irresponsibility.

- the VERY saddening police shows (so sad because they almost always fail at catching up with their so obvious models which are of course their American counterparts)

Maybe the ""France"" section of [this](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A9rie_t%C3%A9l%C3%A9vis%C3%A9e) page will help.
