true,nonim,null,null,"It's not so easy to be a vegetarian, but you'll usually find something to eat in most restaurants, just note that you'll often be forced to eat two first courses instead of first and second course. For more traditional restaurants, a green salad is almost always available, and then you usually have escalivada too (just make sure it's not served with sardine). Depending on the season you'll also find mushrooms (rovellons, ceps, etc), calçots (awesome with romesco sauce, best time of the year for vegetarians), asparagus, etc.

No idea how animals are turned into food, but I think you can find organic meat at groceries like Veritas (they also have a lot of stuff for vegetarians).

Some vegetarian restaurants: La Riera (strongly recommended and cheap), Atzavara (recommended too), Arco Iris, Illa de Gràcia, Biocenter, etc. Just take a look at Happycow, you'll find more of them. There are also some ""fast"" vegetarian (or mostly vegetarian) restaurants such as Fresc Co, but you'll probably get tired of them soon. And then there are also some non-vegetarian restaurants that always have a vegetarian option in their menu, such as Out of China and Gut. Oh, and if you are looking for haute cuisine, there is a vegetarian menu at Moo (45€, 1 michelin star, overseen by the Roca brothers from El Celler de Can Roca).",0,1313480271,null,0,false,0,c2ct2o4,t3_jipkn,t1_c2ct2o4,t3_jipkn,1427477574,1,false,Barcelona,t5_2qosg,1

A [small village](http://www.flickr.com/photos/juanillooo/5443037608/) with a [great view](http://www.flickr.com/photos/beamillion/4761555562/) over the whole area (from Cannes to Nice). Of course you need to go when the weather is clear. Oh, and there is a small local honey producer in the main street, pretty good.

Monaco is good for a day. It's quite small. Go to the castle, the old city (up on the ""rocher""), and to the Casino square. Not much else to see I think.

Marineland at Antibes is cool (but a bit expensive I think). The old city of Antibes, with the market and the view from the [battlements](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ange1a/5625911901/) is worth a walk. You can walk to La Salis then (one of the beaches) and get [this view](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aseed/4551843876/). A bit further (go by bus or car), you can have a walk on the path all around the Antibes cape (starts [here](http://maps.google.fr/maps?q=Plage+%22Keller%22,+Chemin+de+la+Garoupe&amp;hl=fr&amp;ll=43.553183,7.138839&amp;spn=0.008646,0.02135&amp;sll=43.553836,7.137187&amp;sspn=0.002162,0.005338&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;t=h&amp;z=16)).

For Cannes, Le Suquet is nice (the old city), and not far from the Palais des Festivals (where the festivals are) and the Croisette. If you like shopping (or your wife :-P), the rue d'Antibes (parallel to the Croisette) is for luxury and expensive stuff, but the rue Meynadier (still parallel but one block further from the sea) is quite affordable (my mother and sister like to shop there). If you want a nice view over the Cannes bay, there is a great sight next to the Col de St Antoine, between Cannes and Vallauris (much easier to go by car).

If you like old towns and artisan shops, Vallauris have a big reputation for pottery and ceramic.

Grasse (you can go by train from Cannes) have its reputation for fragrance. The town is nice as well, further from the sea than other common visits.

If you like mountains, the Alps are close. The Mercantour is a national park up there. There are a lot of things to do there depending on your willingness to have some sport. Hiking, via ferrata (kind of secure, easy climbing, but still sporty), or just picnic.

In the Var, the Esterel is a small bunch of mountains next to the sea, which very particular views (red stone in particular). A walk can be easy there, just think of taking water.

Also, at [Fayence](http://maps.google.fr/maps?q=fayence&amp;hl=fr&amp;ll=43.617188,6.950912&amp;spn=0.276392,0.683212&amp;sll=43.616194,6.754532&amp;sspn=0.276396,0.683212&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;t=h&amp;z=11) (ok, it's not directly next to Nice, it's a 1 hour drive), there is a gliding field where you can have a flight (it's around 70€ I think).

Es ist lange überfällig, dass Schulen mehr praktisches Wissen für den Alltag lehren. Das kann man einfach nicht mehr von den Eltern verlangen. Was bedeutet das MHD bei verschiedenen Lebensmitteln? Woran erkennt man, dass diese wirklich verdorben sind? Wie hält man sie möglichst lange frisch?  
Wer weiß denn heute zum Beispiel, wann man Schafskäse nicht mehr essen kann? Ich nehme mal an, dass die meisten ihn wegschmeißen, wenn er anfängt nach Hefe zu riechen. Dabei kann man ihn dann, wenn er in Salzlake gelagert wurde, meistens immernoch gut zum Backen oder Kochen verwenden.

Was mich trotzdem an dem Artikel stört, ist dass er ununterbrochen Eindruck mit großen Zahlen schinden will: Soundsoviele Millarden Euro Verlust, Millionen Tonnen weggeschmissen. Das sind doch Uninformationen, niemand kann sich unter solchen Zahlen etwas vorstellen. Viel interessanter wäre es doch, zu wissen an welchem Punkt der Existenz eines Lebensmittels besonders große Teile weggeschmissen werden.

- Don't let the Nigerians into talking to you and selling you shitty bracelets for 20 euros (or they break your jaw if you don't pay once they've started). Don't let the Indis sell you their crappy miniature Effeil Towers either. There are very few of them during events though.
- Around the Sacré Coeur Basilic and behind it it's like a small town, it's very nice and cute there are many shops and restaurants.
- The place Pigalle is on (M°2) as well, the Moulin Rouge is on the right when you get out of the station.
- Are you looking for a nice restaurant ? I can give you advice on that.
- At the end of (M°2) you'll find Charles de Gaulle Etoile which is the central place where the Triumph Arc is located and that connects ways such as Foch avenue and the Champs Elysées.
- At the end of the Champs Elysées (you can walk the whole avenue as most tourists do, just don't fall prey to Roms who are liars and beggars) you will find the Concorde, which is in the centre of a huge open space where you can see the French National Assembly, the Invalides, the Great Palace, the Tuileries ... it's a really great walk.

- As for the festival you're attending here's a detail. Montmartre used to be the place where Parisian wine was made, one of the most famous was called La Goutte d'Or (the golden drop). This zone is now buildings inhabited mostly by muslims so don't hop of finding any remains of a wine factory or fields in that area.

1. Greece needs money or else it will default. This might result in other countries defaulting, namely Portugal, Ireland and Spain. If they default it will cause some big French, German and English banks to go over as well as they got massive amounts of money loaned out to said countries.

2. Greece gets the money, but it seems that the fire hasn't been put out yet. Greece needs more money and eventually gets it. Knowing that financing this through banks is a dangerous thing, politicians look at the European Central Bank (EBC). 

3. The EBC issued bonds to help Italy out. This bond means that all euro-zone nations are financially tied to Italy now, for better or for worse. We're also still stuck to Greece, who might be a ticking timebomb. Realising we're all in the same hole, we figured we might as well work together to get out.

An Audi did it to a friend of mine last week and almost caused an accident with her kid in the van. It is really the lowest of the low kind of asshole who acts like that.

That said, why did you switch back to the left lane? The only reason to be in the left lane is to overtake. I don't know where you are from but it sounds specifically like an American (or maybe more specifically Cali) style of driving where you use whichever lane you want and weave in and out between them. That's not how it works here. You stay in the rightmost lane and only move to the outer lanes when you need to overtake. I'm not justifying the guy's prick reaction, but the people who stay in the left lane going just above the speed limit are just as annoying and frustrating on the road and almost as bad as those twits who sit in the middle lane no matter what speed they are going; there's a special place in hell for those knobs. So when you say ""If it says ""100"" and I'm going maybe 120, why the frakk do they have to insist on going 122 and harass me"", it's moot.

Trickle down won't happen and the unemployment rate in industrialised countries won't raise because some companies get tax cuts, or new companies are founded. Mainly because manual labour isn't demanded and high educated is falling in price too. Especially in direct or indirect government employment like at the university or at schools.

Nope. ""Sonderrechte"" and ""Wegerechte"" are two distinct things. They are *most of the time* used together (the mentioned policecar or ambulance with flashing blue lights), but not always.

*That means* that policemen and perhaps emergency doctors have the right to go faster than the speed limit if their duties required them to do so, **even if they are not in a regular policecar/ambulance**.
Do you know how that stupid Audi-SUV behind you is not a doctor who was alerted at home and is now on his way to a patient in critical contition?

See?

Bottom line: You grit your teeth and make way.

Edit:

""Wegerechte"" in these situations basically means that there's a person behind the wheel who doesn't have to obey all traffic laws.

""Sonderrechte"" means that the *car* of said person has means to show that to other people (e.g. via flashing blue lights on the car's roof).

These two are often used together, but by no means identical. Whenever someone using ""Wegerechte"" isn't in a car that lets him use ""Sonderrechte"", he has to take **extra** care not to cause dangerous traffic situations.

I don't mean to belittle your complaint. I too loathe the submissive weaving required to navigate the autobahn. It often feels like driving the speed limit is the worst of both world. You don't belong on the right - with the endless caravan of trucks and trailers. You don't belong on the left - with the $9/gallon gas guzzling speed demons. As a result, you flip/flop your way between the two sides, spending equal amounts of time between your mirrors and the road ahead. First accelerating then decelerating, never going the speed you want.

If opting out and taking the train isn't possible, I tend to find the driving less stressful if you speed up to match the average left lane speed. Sure you're going faster than the posted limit and faster than you want to for safety/fuel-economy but it also become easier to drive when you're apart of the flow.

&gt; We would like our son to take advantage of the school system there. 

Out of interest, what are your expectations towards the German school system, that the US system can't meet? Germany's school system is not that great either - according to the PISA study (and my own experience) at least - in comparison with other European systems.

Note that you will need a residence/work permit if you want to seek employment in Germany being a US citizen. It can be helpful to have a job offer with a company that can help you with that before coming to Germany.

&gt; Will I qualify for German pension or retirement package as a US national? 

Yes, if you are legally employed you will pay in the pension fund which will entitle you to draw a pension after retirement. You'll most likely have to invest in a private pension fund too, if you plan to support yourself and your wife after retirement.

&gt; Should we plan on selling our vehicles before moving or try to ship them over? 

Probably. I have no idea what it costs to ship a car from the U.S. to Europe, but I could image it being expensive enough to pay for a used mid-class car here. If the cars don't have any emotional value it's probably not worth the money and hassle.

As for beer, this isn't Germany or Austria, so I suggest you get it at the supermarket as well, why ? Because in France restaurants make money on beverages, and they WILL charge you 8 euros for a pinte (half a litre).

Will you be staying at the same hotel ?

For restaurants there are tons of them, avoid kebabs, avoid chinese and disguised japanese (chinese) restaurants. Avoid Mc Do, KFC and Quick unless you don't feel like cooking and want it cheap.

So, I constantly see trucks overtaking each other doing ca. 100. I have yet to see one trucker getting pulled over by the cops for speeding.  
  
Btw, these maneuvers are the reason why I drive left most as long as no one comes up faster from behind. It is quite simple. I can and like to drive 200-220. The right lane is packed with trucks so probable speed is ca. 80. The middle lane is populated by your Smarts and Golf3's that seldomly do more than 120-130. So where am I supposed to go if not left? And the reason why I don't switch back after overtaking someone doing 130 is basically this danger: Truck does 80, Truck behind him accelerates to 100 and immediately pulls in the middle lane to pass. Because of that sudden movement, what would happen if I had driven there doing 200? Crash, most likely.

It's like this. Technically you were already breaking the law by driving over the speed limit. Now, you should have seen in your rearview mirror that there is another car approaching that drives even faster. Also breaking the law. What S54B32 meant about you assuming the pace car role here is, that it is in everyones own freedom to drive as fast as they want. If they decide to break the law, that is their right.

It is not in your powers to say ""I am already breaking the law by driving 10 faster than allowed. This is it. Nobody should drive faster than this."" You say you switched as soon as you could.

Further research suggests that there are ways to save on taxes/duties. Since this is a truck, you'd pay 22% duties plus 19% tax in Germany, plus €100-150 for the privilege. However, for a car that old, you'd only pay the 19% if you ship it to the Netherlands (plus €400 in fees), and even only 5.5% (plus €850 fees) in France. €1500 seems to be a good estimate I keep reading for the safety certification. Shipping itself should cost ~$1000-1500, plus some €1000 or so for yet more fees, getting it off the ship and to your door. So, €4000-5000 plus duties/tax, depending on where you ship it to. The question remains what the basis for the duty/tax calculation would be, since you didn't purchase it recently.

true,rawrr69,null,null,"We have pretty much exactly the same driving style but I do switch back to middle lane when I can, in case it is free... on Sunday, it really wasn't. And sadly, there are too many 2 lane Autobahnen around here so those trucks overtaking other trucks pose an even more serious risk there because you only have the second lane and the Smarts and V8s are trying to make it work there on that one lane. It just sucks.

And I, too, go as fast as I comfortably can and the weather and road conditions and my reaction time permit; on a narrow, winding Landstrasse, sometimes I just cant do 100 because I can't see far ahead, don't know the road and could not brake soon enough, it doesn't feel right... on the 3 lane Autobahn, going 220 in a decent car is comparatively a piece of cake and can be relaxing when there isn't a lot of traffic.

I think I can honestly say that I DO have a pretty good feel for my grip and ""Strassenlage"" and a feel for the whole traffic situation and I am never going faster than all those factors together allow me to and I am constantly watching my mirrors. Usually I am going 140+ to 170 which around here tends to be (way) more than middle lane anyway.

true,HardlyWorkingDotOrg,null,null,"I don't think it's the not realizing the car has mirrors. It's more of the inability to notice stuff happening in there. If I drive 200, but approach cordially on a slower driving vehicle, they just don't seem to realize I am there, wanting to pass. Even my turn signal gets ignored.  
  
If I come screaming down at them at 200 and brake at the very last second as to not crash into them, then I get noticed. Which, of course hurts *my* brakes and *my* gas mileage because of the constant braking and accelerating.   
  
It would be so much nicer if people were able to see stuff happening in the mirror and actually caring about it. For instance, someone driving slower than me. But staying in the left lane because on the horizon, there is a car they will eventually overtake. Ample time for them to switch over, let me pass and switch back so they too can overtake this car. But no. What they are driving should be enough for everybody, so they stay in the lane until they finally passed that car with me steaming behind them. Now they will surely switch, you would think. Nope, because now there is a new car on the horizon so we'll just continue to crawl away in the left lane.  
  
Behavior like this is just ignorant. Once it was so bad that I actually overtook a car like that on the right because of the massive amount of space and time available to do so before this car even reach the car it wanted to overtake. Dude had the dumbest looking expression on his face when I passed. He clearly didn't know/care there were other drivers on the road.  
  
On the plus side, I heard from some policemen, that if they were to see a situation like this unfold and me overtaking on the right without endangering anybody cause there is no one there and without doing so at breakneck speeds, they would not even go after people like me because it is not me that were the problem in that case.",0,1313588186,null,0,false,0,c2d3p1n,t3_jkiio,t1_c2d3p1n,t1_c2d3mo6,1427482722,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

You'll want an [EC card](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cash). Banks usually give you an account for free as a student. The commercial banks have two pools in which they won't charge each other's customers ATM fees, the larger one is [Cash Group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_Group).  
An easy and cheap way to transfer money from the US is to open an account with BoA. Deutsche Bank is part of the [Global ATM Alliance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_ATM_Alliance#Bank_of_America_International_Transaction_Fee.2FForeign_Currency_Fee), so you can withdraw cash at their ATMs directly from a BoA account for very small fees (and then carry it inside to pay it into your German account).

You'll need text books. For English books (and other items), you have several options. Prices can vary significantly between them, which option is cheapest depends on the book and how many you order (fees), so you'll have to compare. Within Germany, there are Buch.de and of course Amazon.de. If you order from Amazon.co.uk, there will be [shipping fees](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=200402870). Orders from Amazon.com *may* cost import duties and taxes on top of shipping fees, since it's from outside the EU. How much that is depends on the content. There are no fees on values less than €22 (*incl.* shipping fees, €45 for private mail). Above that, you'll have to pay VAT, which generally is 19% but only 7% for books. If the total is more than €150, you'll also have to pay duties. If the paperworks are OK, the Post will handle it on your behalf and charge you on delivery.

Also note that as a US citizen, you're still subject to the Cuban embargo even if you reside in Germany. You must not purchase Cuban products, even for consumption in a third country. That's inconvenient, of course, since most bars use Cuban rum for drinks.

How to travel :

the best ways to get around madrid are metro and bus. Metro stations are clearly marked on google maps so thats no problem, a 10 ride ticket costs 9,30 euros. This ticket is good for EMT inner city busses (red or blue) and the metro network for zone A (i doubt she will leave zone A)

Madrid has 2 Rail networks. the inner one which is the metro de madrid. costing 1.50 a single ride. 9.30 for 10 rides (ticket also good for buses), there are also 1, 3, 5 and 7 day tourist passes aswell as a monthly pass. the thing is that they are somewhat expensive and you almost never see anyone with them except people who need to travel 3-4 times a day becuase the entery level monthly pass (zone A) is 47 euros. but it allows free access to bus, rail and metro in zone A. Metro is simbolized by a blue and red rhombus that has metro written inside.

The outer rail network which is the cercanias network are the commuter trains which are used to access most suburbs of madrid. if she visits alcala de henares the easiest way to travel is by cercanias. The 10 ride Metrobus ticket (10 ride metro ticket) is not valid on cercanias and requires a different ticket. the monthly or tourist passes do. 

As for buses. a single bus ride is 1 euro last time i checked (might have changed). Its cheaper then a single metro ride. but its still best to use the 10 ride ticket. I do recommend she takes the 27 bus which goes along the entire main avenue of Madrid which is the castellana. The bus goes from plaza castilla which is the center north bus station to atocha which is the southen inner city bus and rail station, the northern one is chanmartin and its 1 metro station (or 20 minutes walking) from plaza castilla. This bus is good becuase its not a tourist bus so it costs the bare minimum. but at the same time it allows you to see or easly get to walking distance or see the museo del prado and reina sofia as well as the botanical garden and the retiro park. aswell as passing close to land marks like the cibeles or neptune statues. puerta de alcala and the old central mail offices which are the new city hall. 

Just beware of pick pockets of you travel with bags on the bus. quite common on city line buses like the 27 which tends to get quite crowded. 

Its recomeded you bring a open euro freq GSM phone. prepay simcards are cheap starting at 10 euros. i recommend yoigo as a carrier. but be aware that since the Madrid train bombings in 2003 all GSM lines even the prepay ones require that you register them with a valid ID or passport. this means beware what you do with the simcard after you leave. its just better to destroy it. They charge 15 cents + tax for connection fee and then 8 cents a minute and you can have a data connection for 8 euros a month if you need it. 

Safety tips ? the madrid city center is quite safe even at night. theres usualy in the center people on the street till 10-12pm. and the metro network functions till 1:30 (last trains with waiting times of around 15 minutes). I know it will sound racist but most petty street crime against tourists is usually committed by Rumanian gypsies and Moroccan street kids. In the city center keep your bags closed and keep an eye out for them. a friend of mine had to wrestle her purse from 3 Romanian women who just opened her bag in a streetlight and took it out. they also tend to try to distract you with a guide or a map while another walks behind you and grabs your stuff. 

The rules are the same as any travel. leave the most valuables in the hotel safe and carry on you the basics.. a bit of cash. basic ID (passport might be needed for some things). a credit card and no large bags if it can be avoided. DO NOT leave your cellphone on the table when eating at a restorant or cafe. especially not in the city center. 

Sorry about that. madrid is usually a very safe city but it tends to have some tourist Oriented crime in areas like Sol. 

For food. eating in local places is great. but can be expecive. she should avoid eating near stations like atocha or chanmartin aswell as eating around sol becuase the prices are usualy jacked up with a ""tourist tax"". Even the KFC and BK are 1-2 euros more expensive because of the location. 

In the worst case she can always walk in to a supermarket and get some food. Lidl, Mercadona and Dia are the cheapest. Carrefur and alcampo are OK, Avoid Sanches romero and Hipercor like the plague as they are the most expencive. take in to account that places like mercadona tend to charge between 1 and 5 cents per shopping bag. so bring your own or take price in to account. 

Good places to eat cheaply are el tigre as mentioned before its 2 minutes walk from the oscar hotel close to chueca or 10 min from gran via. they basicly serve large tapas with every drink. theres also a couple of bars called la blanca paloma in which you sit down and order a drink and while you drink they keep bringing in tapas. so its cheap and good. The bar and tapa thing is a hit and miss. some bars put the usual olives or crisps and other bars would present you with a huge plate of patatas bravas and a couple of pinchos. usualy the best bars are in 4 areas. Huertas which is behind sol. considered a more adult sector. la latina which is also close to sol which is a more modern but mixed with classic. very nice bars and small clubs in that area. alonso martinez which is very nice for its architectural value but at night it becomes a drinking area for teens. and tribunal which is next door to alonso which is more oriented at the 20+ rocker crowd.  

Huertas is nice to see during the day becuase its part of the old city aswell and you have quotes by poets ingraved in the floor with bronze. 
And your also walking distance from the la Kaixa social center where theres usualy modern art exibits (mostly) for free on display, and it also has a cute vertical garden. and then you have the prado museum just across the castella from that point. 

Also check out el escorial (outside town and requites a trip on the cercanias). its basicly a palace built by one of the kings as a spiritual retreat.

I hate saying this, because it admits just how bad the situation is in EU these days, but I think that USA has more democracy than EU, and I don't think that USA has much democracy at all. US states have more sovereignty than EU states where it matters (ie, laws affecting people who live there), and EU is quickly trying to match USA on all the bad points, mainly becoming an effective international bully through military conquests and trade sanctions.

&gt; You go just barely faster then the middle lane.

Were you there and witnessed how fast the cars were going and how fast I was going exactly? No. Cased closed.

Don't assume and then argue on it just for the sake of desperately having SOMETHING to say. Snap out of it already. You are beating on a completely moot point. Apart from going too fast for being in a 100 zone, I had all the right to be there and several people pointed that out. I just had a wrong phrasing in my initial post, that was all.

There were so many cars on the right and middle lane that I was constantly overtaking; also see HardlyWorkingDotOrg [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/jkiio/is_it_just_me_german_highway_rant/c2d3ff6).

&gt; I found some of you comments quite arrogant, chauvinistic and insulting

Guess my surroundings rub off on me quite a bit!! I have never seen a place with so many cold, condescending, arrogant and especially smart-assed people in one place who love nothing more than correcting and looking down on others and gossiping about others regardless of actually having to say or contribute ANYTHING to the matter at hand or not - case in point: just look at some of the replies in here.

Another example: all those popular German-made TV shows here are about nothing but degrading people and showing you people so fucked up you as the viewer can pat yourself on the back and feel better about yourself. They copy all that shit from the States (no original shows here AT ALL) and then adapt it for Germany and it thrives on nothing but showing authority and authority beating on people and putting people down and looking down on people. It's just classless. Or how do you explain complete BULLSHIT like DSDS and Big Brother and social-porn like ""Frauentauschen"" is still on and more popular than ever? And those are just the few that REALLY stick out.

In the States they go crazy for outrageous sex, hence Jerry Springer et al. - and here looking down on people does the trick. Think about it.

And what you are doing is not too far from that. You are arguing against what I wrote and based solely on facts you made up out of thin air. And half your sentences are quite difficult to understand, you can write them in German instead, it is my mother tongue.

And insulting? Can't stand the heat - stay out of the kitchen. I'm only rude to a selected few idiots in here who were rude and are too stuck up and bound on being ""correct"" so they are missing the details at hand...

And you are blowing ME out for overtaking people while that guy was actually trying to cause a massive pile-up at 100+km/h???

And why with the Germans? The French and German - by and large - are amongst the most smug, cocky and self-opinionated people I have ever encountered on this planet and I have been quite a few places.

EU, apparently, has several.


On a more unrelated but useful note, China, which is a ginormous (can't believe the spell checker accepts this word!) entity has dealt with this fact *de jure*, just like the States have *de facto*: Most Chinese people are bilingual or bi-dialectal, as the official language is Mandarin. Same in the States, most paperwork and most collaboration is done in English. Same in the former soviet union and some countries of the ex-soviet bloc.

And let's not forget the internet, or reddit itself: Most people (except for most Americans and some other English native speakers) are (at least) bilingual and use English for the Internet (and, in most cases, for interacting with any computer or electronic device) and their native language for the rest.     
Many cars, electronics, tools, computers, software etc. only have English text on/in them anyway.       

The main issue with EU law is that, when used in any country, it has to be translated and used in (one of) that country's official language(s). I still find this correct, since English (or French or German) cannot possibly be made mandatory learning without violating human rights.    

Oh, and the percentage of native English speakers in the EU is smaller than for many other EU official languages (such as French or German, for instance). Not to mention the constant UK bitching about wanting out of Europe.

This attitude of ""I deserve it"" is found throughout society today. We are all on the internet now browsing sites like facebook, twitter and reddit so I don't think the leap to a political forum would be that big. But the issue of setting up a system that is fair and 'game'-proof remains. I think there could also be an alternative public forum where people would go to discuss matters, in person, in their constituency (for those not in favour of the internet method) with their elected politicians. The essence of my proposal is that there needs to be better dialogue between governments and the people. Governments should no longer be allowed to make major decisions (war, finance etc.) with out the blessing of the majority. In the age of technology there is no reason for a system like that not to be implemented and our political situation in most western countries is dysfunctional to say the least.

true,nfrank12,null,null,"I'm moving into the student hostel for the first semester at least, I figured that would be easiest to get settled in and if I don't like it I can move out into a different apartment or something. I saw in order to enroll at the university I need the following things:

* original graduation certificates of high school 
* original graduation certificates of bachelor degree
* certified transcripts of both of the above
* admission letter 
* passport
* entry visa for study purposes
* proof of health insurance
* copy of bank transfer order
* proof of financial means to stay in Germany for a year
* proof of English knowledge

So I have questions about a lot of these and since you've already enrolled I think you can help. I'm not really sure how to obtain an original graduation certificate from my high school. I can probably go there and talk to someone but I figured you would know what to do since you've already done this. Will my transcripts be enough to prove that I have graduated? Same for bachelors, do you think my transcripts will be enough? I mean honestly I don't want to take my original graduate diplomas over there which is what they are asking for. I don't want to risk damaging them or losing them.

I'm in Hungary at the moment and went to the Hungarian-German embassy and they said as an American I don't need an entry visa to get into Germany, that we can enter without one. I went to Germany before without doing anything so I assume this is true, but would like you to confirm it so I don't fuck anything up. 
Proof of health insurance..I have American health insurance through my parents. If this isn't enough, which I don't think it is, it says on my acceptance packet that ""you will receive more information once you are here"" concerning German health insurance. Hopefully this actually happens?
Hopefully I have some sort of copy of the bank transfer..and how do you prove you have financial means? I can show them my bank account online, did you just print out a receipt or something? 
Really, thanks for all of your help.

The graduation certificate I found in my father's safe, from when I actually graduated. You should call the secretary at your high school and ask her to please fax you one. A fax of my birth certificate was enough, so perhaps this will be. 

It was impossible for me to provide my bachelor's certificate, as it was framed at high cost to my family and dissembling this would require new framing. They reluctantly accepted my official transcripts.   

About health insurance, you need to look into travel insurance first. You should call your current provider and ask what it costs for them to provide you coverage in Germany for 30 days. You don't have to do this to get your permission in Germany, but it's pretty stupid to travel without insurance, imho. Once you're here, then you have 30 days to shop around for insurance. It may end up being cheaper for you to sign up for 1 year of travel insurance from your current provider. Legally, however, I think it's okay to stay in Germany for up to 90 days without insurance, so it's fine to figure that out once you're here.

I'm a paid researcher here, so I didn't have to prove financial means, but I did in another European country for my Master's, so this might be good advice anyway. I went to my bank and asked for a letter from them stating my account numbers and balances and the date and for how long that money'd been available (to prove that it didn't just show up yesterday and will be returned to its original owner tomorrow... I think it needed to be there for ~3 months or something.)  The bank knew about what I was talking, so they just printed out some form letter. Tell them for what you need it and they'll know how to help.

Proof of English is waived if you did your undergraduate in an English speaking country, so you're good there. I don't know what you're talking about for a ""bank transfer"". I never had to pay them. I had to have a German bank account, but that took like two seconds and a cup of free coffee at Deutsche Bank.  When you arrive, the first thing you need to do is register with the city.

true,timoleon,null,null,"&gt;Is this such a stupid question?

It well could be:

- a *balanced budgets* means that the government doesn't create new debt by balancing expenditures with revenue  

- a *trade deficit* refers to a country spending more on importing foreign goods and services than it makes from exporting its own

The two are not closely related. The first results from government overspending. The second from disparities between national economies, e.g. in production costs and saving rates. 

&gt;Is the article ignorant?

Simply put, yes. It was written by a pro-Eurobond advocate, who basically wants the countries with better performing economies to pay for those with failing ones. Which is a great way of wasting what little liquidity and growth still exist in the EU.

The author ignores factors like deliberate overspending and over-borrowing for political purposes in Greece, or the need for many EU-governments to bail out their failing banks with public money in 2008-2009, like e.g. in Ireland. 

There must be an end to ever higher public debt, or more than one country in the Eurozone will eventually have to default.  Greece's default seems almost inevitable, unless a miracle happens. ",0,1313776090,null,0,true,0,c2dp2e7,t3_jnbkv,t1_c2dp2e7,t1_c2dn6cj,1427492978,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3
