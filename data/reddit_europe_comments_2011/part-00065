sur Reddit, le français est minoritaire et même sur les subreddit francophones, il y a pas mal d'anglais. Trop je crois pour faire de reddit un lieu d'échange où tous les francophones seront à l'aise de venir échanger. J'aimerais beaucoup pointer mes amis unilingues francophones vers un endroit où ils se sentiraient citoyens de première zone. C'est même indispensable à mon avis pour élargir le débat. Les subbreddit francophones sont assez peu actifs et les débats qu'on y trouve sont rarement d'un grand intérêt. C'est de toute évidence en emmenant beaucoup plus de monde que ça pourra s'améliorer. 

Ceci dit, lirele semble pour l'instant surtout parler  pénis et de vos problèmes de colocation. Je n'ai rien contre ça mais personnellement ça me laisse plutôt froid. 

J'aurais envie d'un endroit où plein de gens discutent des nouvelles du monde, de la science et de la technologie en français avec les outils qui ont été développés par reddit avec tous les avantages que ça apporte pour élever un peu le débat. 

Pour que ça arrive il devra y avoir une masse critique de gens qui participent avec des discussions intelligentes et des commentaires qui vont de paire. Le défi n'est pas technologique mais plutôt de resautage et de garder les gens qui vont venir participer. 

Dans ce cadre, je suis très intéresser par votre tentative. Mais sans que ça devienne ennuyeux, je vous propose d'élever un peu le niveau de vos contributions pour ne pas faire peur à ceux qui pourraient éventuellement être intéressés à se joindre à vous.

The allocation of seats is complicated. It started with the assumption that each country voted individually for its MEPs without any pan-European thinking or discussion at all. Now, an election is considered democratic when each voter has the same probability of casting the decisive vote, once translated into parliament (i.e. when he/she changing his/her mind would have the same probability of resulting in different outcome of a parliamentary vote). Under these circumstances of isolated elections for a common parliament this means roughly a square root distribution of seats. I'm afraid it's been too long for me to present the maths.
Also, if we take each country individually, there has to be a minimum* number of seats for a country in order to have any power in that setting at all. So there, over the years there's been some negotiating but it stayed like that more or less.

Dies betrifft aber sowohl Immigranten wie auch Deutsche selbst. 
Die Integrationspolitik ist fehlgeschlagen, das steht außer Frage. Leider wird auch immer deutlicher, dass die Bildungspolitik (neben vielen anderen Politikfeldern, allern voran der (nicht oder nur rudimentär vorhandenen) Sicherheitspolitk) ein ebensolcher Fehlschlag ist.

Assuming you want both and education and to perfect your english here is my input:
1. I would figure out if you can technically enroll in last year of a high school - I don't think its possible if you have your BAC or if you are over 18. Plus you need to get  a J1 visa so expect some paperwork!

2. Going to university here is extremely expensive even for a year. I would recommend community college or a state college either way you are looking at 15K to 50K a year depending on what you choose. For that price, I;d stay the extra length and actually get a degree or at least credit! 

3. ESL is a great idea, I also know alot of french people that were an au pair

4. My advice - enroll in a french university or school that has exchange programs. Its alot more cost effective and at least you will get a degree or credit.

Good luck!

I commend you on your decision to move to Germany. I can assure you its a great country and the transport is top-notch. I live in Berlin and my rent is about 400 euro a month. If I can do it, it proves that it is not impossible, because I am certainly not the smartest guy you'll meet today.

That being said, I speak to people often in the US who express a desire to live in Europe as if all it required was a plane ticket, a hackey-sack and a pair of skinny jeans. Folks don't realize that backpacking to Prague is one thing, finding an apartment is another. Talking to a guy who works at your hostel is easy and fun, talking to the Auslanderamt is the seventh level of hell. People often cant appreciate the fact that the EU protects jobs for EU citizens and only allows foreigners to fill jobs that EU citizens cannot fill (that's EU citizens, not just German citizens). Some people think, 'hey Ill just wait tables' but dont realize what it means to be an illiterate immigrant. Even more people are enchanted by all this talk of free healthcare and benefits not realizing that those are for EU citizens and, aside for accounting for some %20 of their salary, are fiercely guarded. 

So, of course, you are not one of those people. Right? You have a clear grasp of German, money in the bank, marketable skills, concrete job leads and cast-iron determination. These are just some realities you need to consider.

It seems to be that they believe the problems are directly being caused by the government. I always end up explaining to them that if the other countries don't give them money, NOBODY will get paid... or people can be paid slightly less and quite a few people get paid overall... it seems when it gets put that way they seem to understand it a bit better and it's a bit of an ""oh.."" moment.. something tells me the organizers of most of these strikes and protests know what the problems are but are only pushing for these things to try and protect their own really high paying position etc. It is VERY logical that from the moment that other countries are paying the bills, they get to tell you what you can and can't have. The only thing ""public opinion"" will do in this case is getting people in Germany to say ""screw these greeks.. why should we pay for them?""... and then shit gets 100 times worse for the greeks and then they blame it on the Germans and keep a grudge or some crap.

I also explain to them that if they just went back to the drachma, their currency would lose a lot of value almost immediately and they will end up becoming a third world country for quite a few years and abused as cheap labour. Life would maybe appear slightly better for a while, but quite a lot of ""luxuries"" 1st world countries enjoy such as electronics, travelling etc will become quite impossible for them.

There is no quick solution for this problem. Whatever happens greeks will suffer unfortunately. The way they are currently trying to go about it at least has a chance of allowing greece to continue with a ""1st world"" standard of living at some time in the near future.

For greek friends hanging around here... if shit is feeling very bad already, it will probably get a bit worse before it gets better.. If you want an overnight fix your only real option is to move out for a while... Olympic Airways is now offering very cheap flights to Cyprus (which is an easy country for you to move to language-wise). I'm guessing the real aim of this cheap flight campaign is to try to boost tourism from Cyprus -- it's very tempting at 49 euros return... it costs like 50 euros for a taxi to the airport hehe. It seems to be quite easy to find a minimum wage job (~900 euros/month) and being able to talk in greek will give you a slight advantage over others in higher paying jobs where greek language may be a plus for certain things.

Life would maybe appear slightly better for a while, but quite a lot of ""luxuries"" 1st world countries enjoy such as electronics, travelling etc will become quite impossible for them.

Not to mention that their debt would suddenly be much, much more expensive to pay for them, since the drachma's value would plummet compared to that of the Euro, which their debt is mostly in.

And I certainly agree with the rest of your post. Here is my take on it, cross-posted from [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldevents/comments/lgbmo/it_might_seem_crazy_to_protest_a_bailout_meant_to/c2son7a):

&gt; Personally I think it's mostly just a symptom of most people not being acquainted with macro-economics, or the intricacies of how the financial system works. So when their pay is cut or they are laid off from work, the knee-jerk reaction is to go ""Fuck that, and fuck this government. You're making my life worse"", while being blissfully unaware of the long-term consequences if those measures were not taken, such as the crisis spreading to Italy and Spain, or French and German banks going bankrupt because they hold so much Greek debt, which would threaten the entire financial system of Europe.

&gt;Most people view the situation from a ""me"" perspective, which is understandable, and thus react negatively to anything which will decrease their living standards. Especially if they are not aware that their living standards will be even more decreased if nothing is done.

&gt;The unfortunate thing for Greece is that these protests are only exacerbating the image of Greeks as irresponsible. What the rest of the world is thinking now is that first the Greeks get themselves in this mess with corruption, tax evation and politicians giving hand-outs to the electorate (and the electorate joyfully accepting), and now they don't want to take responsibility for it, while the rest of Europe's economy is on the edge partly because of them.

&gt;It's a huge drain on EU solidarity, and whatever the view in Greece is, which tends to paint themselves as victims of either their government or Germany, the fact of the matter is that the Greeks are not only gambling with the economy of Europe, but also with the very solidarity that is supposed to keep Europe together.

&gt;And regardless if the Greeks think this is just or not, they better take it into account.

A Greek bankruptcy will decimate the European economy. Firstly, Germany and Frace own the majority of the Greek debt. A Greek default would mean a loss of billions for those countries. Secondly, a default would trigger a tremendous increase in interest rates. That means, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland can not borrow money. If that occurs, these countries will also have to seek help from the IMF and EU(since EU members participate in the bailouts). Good luck finding money to bailout countries like Italy. 

In other words, we are getting help not because we are pretty, friends or descendants of the ancient Greeks(laughable idea).That's rubbish. We are getting help because without it we will cause harm to the rest of Europe.

true,specofdust,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;According to the [1] latest polls (unfortunately it is in jpgs in Greek, but there is a [2] pdf also in Greek in the same page) PASOK would lose by a [3] wide margin . 

Right, but New Democracy would be re-elected? This isn't specific to Greeks, but parties in power are always less popular when there's not an election coming up. How would collapsing the current government and getting ND back in be productive? (I'm sure I don't need to remind you that their leader was the most recent to commit fraud the EU and lie to your entire country). We have political terms for a reason, to give people a decent chance to make a difference before they're judged, because in general a population is more impatient than reality demands for serious political change. To that end, I would say attempting to collapse the government, **especially** when it would quite obviously either result in ND or (maybe, just maybe) PASOK getting back in, seems utterly pointless and kind of unproductive in democratic terms.

&gt;Another interesting question is ""Do you thing think the country is 
headed in the correct direction?"" [4] 85%  say no.

Really though, not many people in Europe (or much of the world) are going to feel their country is headed in the right direction. I think people tend to be fairly downbeat about the world, it seems to be in our nature. We complain constantly, we bemoan our violent unsocial world when all the actual evidence says we're living in the most peaceful century of the entirity of human history, and are far more socially aware and active than ever before. I'm not saying people are stupid or anything, just that I think it's easy to lose perspective of what we've gained, and all that good progress that's made every single year, while focussing on the problems of the moment. It's part of what makes humanity so productive and active, but it's not great for perspective.

&gt;...but I totally disagree with this. It is not preventing a collapse of the Greek economy but it postpones it until it has covered its ass. In fact the austerity has caused a greater depression than expected in the Greek economy this year. The current policy has been far from beneficial for Greeks.

It's prevented it so far though, hasn't it? The goal is to prevent the collapse, and so far, it's worked. As someone or other further up said earlier on, it's because the EU is loaning Greece money that public sector workers are still getting paid. That seems pretty beneficial to me. The long term prospects for Greece if it collapses are very, very poor. The chances of preventing a default may be low, but even if they're 10% it's worth it, because the effects of a Greek default would be...unpleasant.

As I read it the strikes are going to be massive. Even the employees in the finance ministry will be striking, and members of PASOK is beginning to waver in support of the austerity measures facing this huge popular opposition.

This is a quote from Der Spiegel:

&amp;gt; It is just one sign that the state apparatus could be disintegrating. And there is also deep dissatisfaction within the parliamentary group of the governing Pasok party. Member of parliament Thomas Robopoulos, for example, resigned in protest against the austerity measures. And a former economics and labor minister, Louka Katseli, announced she would vote against the planned legislation to reduce private-sector wages.

That's 100% true. The risk is high. Plus, it was the state that caused its debt, not an external European source. 

As for PASOK and the members voting against :

Two months ago, we had another parliamentary vote taking place for austerity measures(the first ones). I remember 3 members of the party being against the measures and stating that they would vote against. In the end the two voted for. It is a fragile situation and nobody is certain.

Apart from the vote, there is also a european meeting on Sunday. We shall see.

Also the leader of ND changed in 2009 (not that the current guy is any better). I feel that if you are to have a meaningful democracy, one of the most important principles is for the representatives to be revocable. They are given a mandate when elected, based mainly on what their program is. If they don't follow it, it is important to be able to change them. Also, giving someone a carte blanche for four years is not really participatory democracy. In fact it's not democracy, it is parliamentary oligarchy.

Since 2009 people in Greece have seen their income reduced significantly, and prices of goods and services (and taxes), either remained more or less constant, or were raised. There is a significant part of the population for which [poverty](http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,775301,00.html) is the reality. [Unemployment](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/15/greece-unemployment-idUSL5E7KF16320110915) and [suicide rates](http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-09-20/europe/30178967_1_greece-psychologist-talks-debt-crisis) are soaring. A lot of people in Greece find it more and more difficult to survive every day, so yes for them the country is headed in the wrong direction.

Finally I believe that the goal is not to prevent a default of Greece, but its consequences for the banks that are exposed to Greek bonds. I agree that the effects of a Greek default would be unpleasant (major understatement) for the Greeks, but as you said before this is not the reason the EU is lending Greece.

&gt; You know why? Because all of your politicians profit from Greece all these years and they have much more coming!

The entire EU profits from a prosperous Greece. Broke and unemployed Greeks can't buy the things we offer and can themselves not offer us anything worthwhile. Everyone loses if Greece loses.

And the Greek people are the ones who either elected them or didn't care enough to stop them from being elected. Until now, I hope. Greece is a democracy, Greeks can run for office themselves or support worthwhile candidates. It's not easy, but the current situation isn't either.

The fact is, nothing has changed. The only difference is that the old way of handling the situation is no longer applicable. Before the Euro, Greece had [very high inflation](http://www.inflation.eu/inflation-rates/greece/historic-inflation/cpi-inflation-greece.aspx). What effect did that have? Prices for everything foreign went up regularly. Today that's no longer possible, you can't inflate your way out of it any more because Greece can't just print Euros. Domestic prices have to be cut manually, one by one, instead of globally reducing them through inflation (with global meaning ""all of Greece"" in this context).

true,specofdust,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;Since 2009 people in Greece have seen their income reduced significantly, and prices of goods and services (and taxes), either remained more or less constant, or were raised. There is a significant part of the population for which [1] poverty is the reality. [2] Unemployment and [3] suicide rates are soaring. A lot of people in Greece find it more and more difficult to survive every day, so yes for them the country is headed in the wrong direction.

That's the understandable, but childish way of looking at things. If I take heroin for 10 years and then stop, I will feel terrible. The withdrawal symptoms will make me shake and scream and I will want to take more heroin, that does not mean taking heroin again is the right ""direction"". You feel me?

I get that Greeks are going through a shitty time right now, but that's not because of current policies, that's because of past policies. The shitty times are here, and they are real, and they are unavoidable. To avoid them in the short term is to experience collapse in the long term, and that will just mean shitty times for 50-100 years, instead of shitty times for a decade or two.

&gt;Finally I believe that the goal is not to prevent a default of Greece, but its consequences for the banks that are exposed to Greek bonds. I agree that the effects of a Greek default would be unpleasant (major understatement) for the Greeks, but as you said before this is not the reason the EU is lending Greece.

Again, of course it isn't. There shouldn't be anything wrong with that. But your logic just doesn't especially make sense to me. The idea that the Germans would bankroll the Greeks just so the Greeks could pay back *French* banks before they collapse is just...weird. This also ignores the fact that even German and French exposure to Greek debt is only about 45% of the amount that the EU has bailed Greece out for already. That is to say, if the Germans and French were truly worried about their banks, it'd be cheaper just to give the money to the banks than to bail out Greece just for it to collapse later on.

So I suppose what I'm saying is, is that if the Germans (and others) are truly bailing out Greece just to ensure banks get their money back, they're doing it in a round about way which is adding €100 billion or so onto the bill. Hence this course of action seems unlikely due to it's extreme insanity and it seems much more likely that they actually **are** trying to save the Greek economy, whether you will accept it or not as a country.

I wish there was more general awareness of these sorts of figures in Greece, because I feel like if people understood that the money the EU has spent on Greece is already rapidly approaching the amount Greece owes the entire world, then they would understand that the EU is actually trying to save their economy, and not just bail out its own banks which it already could have done, far more cheaply, far more simply, and without having people start hating them for helping them.",0,1319063891,null,0,true,0,c2suaue,t3_lhazw,t1_c2suaue,t1_c2sr3pn,1427755143,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Originally, they made sure that radio stations and the like didn't use the intellectual property of other people without their consent. Artists would go to GEMA for compensation, GEMA would get radio stations to pay them for using other people's creations. GEMA is an optional service for the artists (meaning there is plenty of GEMA-free content), and it is a not-for-profit organization.

So, the original reason why GEMA stops youtube from ""broadcasting"" certain videos is to protect the creator of the video. **However**, GEMA blocking youtube videos has been cause for controversy in Germany. Mainly, because it doesn't go too well with international contracts that youtube has with companies like SME, who are already paid by youtube for the broadcasting rights. My prediction is that GEMA will soon be a thing of the past, but as with all things, the wheels of German bureaucracy turn slowly.

Maybe some are doing that (Cameron in the UK seems to want to have a grand social experiment in polyarchy, with his 'Big Society', but he can't sell it to the entrenched Brits) but it is an open question as to whether government as we know it can survive in the face of polyarchic *governance* and whether national democracy can remain as the sole or best guage of legitimacy.

Not really, I'm just saying that the 10% of the population is responsible for the 90% of tax frauds. But they are the politicians or their ""friends"" and the laws have been made so that they cannot be touched. Is that so hard to understand?

The shops you say, me, my friends and the normal everyday worker are the 90% of the polulation who are responsible for the 10% of tax evasion, something that we would never do if WE SIMPLY HAD ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY THEM!!! And this happens because they make laws to suit their needs and they exempt themselves from paying their laws by amendments to the very same laws. So, when I pay and pay and pay there is a point that there is no more money in my pocket and my family's safety is on the line. That's when I try to evade taxes!

C'mon now!!! You read 60% of the swiming pools and you think that every greek owns a swiming pool, so 60% of greeks do not declare their swiming pools. The people that own swiming pools do not care about the crisis! They have enough money and they are the people who are exempt from the laws according to which all of us pay!
And what about that 20000m2 of that hotel you mention. God, do you believe that the guy who owns that hotel i in the same fate as me? Do you think that he pays taxes? He is, most probably, in the aforementioned 10% of the largest tax evaders in Greece and the law doesn't do anything to put him behind bars!

In fact currencies move everyday and banks don't blow up because of it!

- You see this bridge? 300 million euros cost. 15 million in my pocket.

The greek minister smiled in compliance and said nothing. One month later, the greek minister calls the german in Greece. After the usual hospitality and all the typical stuff, the greek minister shows the german some of the works of his time in the office. At some point they reach a place in the middle of nowhere. Nothing to see for miles in all directions. The greek minister says then with an attitude of a thousand cardinals (as we say here):

- Do you see this bridge? It's the largest in Europe.
- What bridge? , the german minister says
- Cost 1 billion euros. 100 million in my pocket.

true,Britzer,GERM,Germany,"Farming: We have huge problems with farm animals such as that we only focus on high yield animals and breed them so that most of them are siblings (coming from lines of high yield ancestors). Because they are so close genetically and usually kept in ""factory-farming"" barns very close to each other they are very likely to get deseases themselves. So we have to give them antibiotics all the time. Meat farming is seriously f*cked up in EU countries these days. And the EU policy of subsidizing for mass (guaranteed prices) is to blame for that.

Whaling: While I don't condone whaling I firmly believe that the biggest problems our oceans are facing these days is pollution and overfishing of all kinds of species. Not only whales. But instead of tackling that problem the EU is buying the right to overfish costal waters of African countries, while, at the same time has to subsidize their fishing fleet. Without such a large fishing fleet the EU wouldn't need to buy fishing rights, because we wouldn't have that many boats. Also this will destroy West African fishing industries and cause conflict (people of work), general instability, poverty and will, among many other things, lead to more people from those countries trying to enter the EU.

true,dageshi,null,null,"As a rule interest rates help to control the demand for loans within an economy. The central bank controls the base rate which the banks within a country will use as a basis for their lending, so normally when lending money a bank will never lend lower than the base rate, it will usually add a few percent on top.

The idea is that a loan at 2% for a year is much better than a loan at 5% for a year (because obviously it costs you much less to repay your loan+interest)

So in a recession the central bank can lower interest rates to spur people to take on debt to expand or create new businesses, hence increasing economic activity within the economy. On the opposite side, if the economy is doing well and inflation is rising, interest rates can be increased in order to dampen down on economic activity.

The problem is that each country within the eurozone is different and most probably need slightly different interest rates, so during the boom, the interest rates were way too low for Ireland but were perhaps about right for Germany.

Right now, Britain has an interest rate of 0.5% and probably Ireland could do with a similar rate, but it has 1.5% which is the current eurozone interest rate. ",0,1319140823,null,0,false,0,c2t32te,t3_lj1vr,t1_c2t32te,t3_lj1vr,1427759347,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

true,thelittlebig,EURO,European Union,"Well you should consider that for quite a long time the Polish king was voted on and held little power compared to the nobles. He might even have been weaker than the Kaiser in Germany or the King in Hungary (both also voted into office). It is easier to keep a Kingdom or realm of any kind large if the obligations of its parts to the central authority are minimal. The Holy Roman Empire lasted from 960ish until Napoleon only because its states did not have to leave the Union even when they faught wars against each other every other year. Being in the Empire protected member states from agression by the Ottomans (one of the main reason for the Habsburg Kaisers), the Magyars (Ottonen), the French, etc. Also being a federal noble (Markgrafen, Herzöge/count, King of Bohemia, Bishops, abbots of federal monasteries, etc.) allowed one to influence decisions on a federal level. 
Sorry for the German centric explanation, it is my nationality and I suspect it went along those lines in Poland, too. Maybe someone with more knowledge in that area could chime in.

Basically only 2 channels out of the main 7 are not directly controlled by government affiliated people and oppose Berlusconi's influence. One of them (Rai 3) is a state TV channel, but it's slowly being reduced into irrelevance as they're taking away all the interesting shows. The other (La7) is a private channel which, in my opinion, is doing a decent job of staying informative and right now it's probably the most serious and balanced source of news.

The other channels' news programs range from the utterly inane (75% gossip and filler) to outright propaganda service, with purposefully edited videos that cut out protests or marginalize some facts. They have also been caught adding fake applauses to cover booing and stuff like that.

Until last year there were also 2 political talk shows and a satire program that were pretty strongly critical of the government and were also the TOP programs the state TV had in terms of audience. Now only one of them is left, as their authors found themselves suddenly without a contract. As a result the state TV lost lots of audience (much to the enjoyment of Berlusconi's channels) and some very popular and criticizing voices were forced off the air.

Newspapers and the internet offer a somewhat broader choice of views, but unfortunately not many people get their news from them. The new law proposal would provide an easy tool to control what gets said, since you can basically disagree with anything someone says to force a retraction, followed possibly by heavy punishment.

The debate is now how far and how fast the EU should go from here. By going too fast, governments may risk upsetting their electorates and artificially creating a renewed sense of Euroskepticism, contrary to the pro-European mantra of nearly all mainstream European parties. By going too slow, the European, and thus global, economy are put in deep jeopardy. It is now abundantly evident that the EU as it exists today is too decentralized to produce the quick response needed to the sovereign debt crisis. One could draw considerable comparisons to the United States under the Articles of Confederation. In took about a decade for the Articles to fail, prompting the Constitutional Convention that produced the Constitution of the United States, creating a powerful federal system. One bump in the road is not a sufficient reason to abandon the European project that has lifted the living standards of so many people, and brought more prosperity and convenience to people across the continent.
