true,Duhbeed,null,null,"I'm seriously puzzled by this... Are you really living in Madrid or just made up a few random facts? Anyway I suppose you've been here for very very little time so you couldn't grab real stereotypes and are just biased by some random experiences you had. Some of the points may be true but most of them make no sense:

·Siestas: this is so non-true... How many people do you know who take siestas everyday? Because I've been living here since I was born and can't tell of anybody, except retired seniors or people with plenty of free time who also happen to like siestas (these two conditions are not necessarily related). Seriously, I know there's high unemployment here, but if you stay here a little more and meet some real people you'll realize most people's lives are incompatible with daily siestas. Besides, some of us never do it even when we have the time (weekends, vacation...).

· ""I can walk everywhere. Metro/bus system is superb"" : That's true in Madrid, but may not be so true in some suburbs, rural areas and smaller cities. It's like trying to describe transportation in the USA if you've only been to Manhattan. Anyway, public transportation is much better in Europe than in North America overall, but taking Madrid as an only example is too biased.

· ""No taxes or tips"": well, I get the ""taxes"" comment... I suppose you are aware that taxes here are much higher than in the US, but you just mean most of the tagged prices do not split them from the final amount to pay, unlike in the US. That's right, but describing it as ""no taxes"" could be a little misleading for somebody who doesn't know what you're talking about. About the tips, you are not totally right... It's not like in US cities at all, but you should tip something in restaurants (and some bars too) to be polite. Tipping the pizza delivery guy is also common, for example.

· ""They put ham and cheese on everything"": this is totally surreal. I don't know what you're talking about, honestly. Cheese consumption in Spain is not particularly high compared to other countries and its most common use is as a single ""tapa"" instead of a base ingredient or garnish for meals like in other traditional cuisines (French, Italian, German...). Of course, you may ask for cheese at some places and is present in common ""imported"" meals such as sandwiches, hamburgers and so on, but don't you think it's a basic ingredient in traditional Spanish cuisine, because it's not: cheese is just a typical ""tapa"". About ham, it's not so clear... The most typical kind here is cured ham (""serrano"" ham), rather than smoked and boiled varieties you are used to in some countries. It's widely used as a tapa and as an ingredient for typical dishes, but I wouldn't say we put ham in everything at all.

""Online poker"": I think this is only a passing fad. Poker has never been particularly popular here compared with English-speaking countries. The traditional Spanish card set is different from the one used in poker and games played with these cards are more popular, specially ""mus"".

""They don't have donuts here"": I'm also really puzzled by this, because it's totally wrong. It may not be the most popular food in Spain, but donuts are really easy to find anywhere in Spain, both in their traditional bakery version (which we call ""rosquillas"") or the American imported version (which we actually call ""donuts"")... Even the chain ""Dunkin' Donuts"" have some notable presence in Spanish big cities (although it's named ""Dunkin' Coffee"" for copyright reasons). But it's not only fast food, just enter any cafeteria in Madrid for breakfast and chances that you can't find donuts alongside croissants or churros to choose are very rare. Go to any supermarket and you'll find brands like ""Donuts"" (yes, here the word is a brand which has become a generic term, and it's owned by a very large food company named ""Panrico"", thus the ""Dunkin' Donuts"" issue) and ""Donettes"" (delicious mini-donuts covered on chocolate or glazed sugar) on the higher and most visible shelves.

""GOOD MUSIC IS NORMAL HERE"": well, I know this is so subjective, but as a hardcore music fan I have to tell you good music is anything but normal in this country. Those who have a sophisticated taste for music are really rare here.

""Instead of pigeons, there are parakeets"": What??????? LOL You're kidding me, right?

""I cannot identify more than half of the liquors here"": this is kind of weird, because when I go to the US I identify most of the liquors there. Well, maybe it means we have a higher variety here and that liquors are much more widely consumed in nightclubs (specially combined with soft drinks), while in the US it's normal to drink beer all night (here you start with beer, then you get ""serious"" :P) or just do shots, in which case taste is not particularly relevant so you don't need to know what you are drinking exactly.

""Even if I don't talk, people can tell I'm not fluent. I need to figure out how to fool them..."": I think this is not a matter of being in Spain. No offense, but I have met people from many different countries and can tell Americans (I guess you are American, don't ask me why) are the worst at learning languages, which is particulary shocking when you have a huge exposure to Spanish language on your society. Maybe that stereotypical view of American people we have makes us think you won't be fluent if we know where you are from. Besides, Spaniards are also awful at languages in general, so we are probably more empathetic with people who try to speak a foreign language and try to be helpful with them.",0,1315522013,null,0,true,0,c2igy65,t3_k7mnw,t1_c2igy65,t3_k7mnw,1427575803,15,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,15

I would think that collective bonds which are senior to any further national debt and with their volume capped within stability pact requirements cannot be a liability for decisions of other states, since if any mismanagement of national finances lead to their default, this would be charged to the junior bonds first until this is exhausted fully, and the clearly bounded rather than incalculable liability via senior common debt level is one accepted as non-risky already in the stability pact by all countries that ratified that.  In any case, it needn't happen, or not yet; I simply said I hope it does. Well:

You should enjoy just walking around, shopping, eating, visiting museums and parks (museums are free for those younger than 18)-- try going to the Louvre in the evening when the statues are lit up and there are fewer crowds. Paris is one of the best places in the world for movies and always has lots of English-language ones including revivals-- check the Pariscope, a 40-cent weekly, for them. Try visiting the new aquarium at Trocadero, across from the Eiffel Tower. Take buses not metros if you are not in a hurry and want to see the city. You are also more likely to meet people on them. You can buy a ticket on the bus, they stop every two or three blocks, and the routes are clearly explained and announced both on the bus stop maps and inside the bus.

Parc Astérix is still open and it's a wonderful fun French park (based on the Astérix comics) with better rides than Paris Disneyland and of course way French-er. http://www.parcasterix.fr/en

There aren't really any dangerous things to watch out for in Paris, except pickpockets and they tend to be in just a few places: number one, the Châtelet metro station. Just keep valuables out of sight. Recently there has been a rash of gold-necklace-snatching, and iPhones are the top theft target so don't use a smartphone in public without making it hard for a thief to grab it.

hm, if it so suits you, interesting then that the British never entered the border-less zone at all. 

But no, I completely disagree; a free trade zone w/o freedom of movement of workers, w/o recognition of qualifications, w/o a right to at least vote in regional elections, w/o health and social security payments transfers etc, is a lopsided system giving the producers the upper hand in any labor negotiations since they can move where its cheaper for them and the workforce can't to any extent; w/o a competition authority, w/o freedom of establishment, w/o common regulations on health and safety of products, w/o common duties and tariffs, w/o a common agricultural policy re subsidies etc is just a collection of anti-competitive practices rather than an efficient market where the best players profit, and a borderless zone w/o common border controls and tight police and judicial cooperation is a boon for cross-border crime, etc.

&gt;A federal europe doesnt suit us the people, you're dutch, I'm British, we are all very different people and cultures. 

hah, that's a Croatian flag actually :) But I don't see Britain being a part of such further integrations; given internal dynamics there, it looks more likely they'd exit unless they and similar countries not particularly keen on further integration are given more formally an 'outsider' status - as the article you linked suggests: ""EU states which choose not to accept political union will have to be offered a new form of associate membership.""

It looks like he's simply speaking of a commissioner that monitors a country in persistent breach and upon non-compliance w his/her demands, suggests the standard array of sanctions to the Council, which come into effect unless a supermajority there rejects them (reverse qualified majority vote). But he also wants a final penalty of kicking them out if this doesn't work, which can't happen w/o a change of treaties. I'm not finding if he is actually suggesting any executive power which the comissioner is to have over a country rather than just demands and fines upon non-compliance, or even a power to fine then for non-compliance w/o the possibility of a supermajority in the Council shooting that down.


Given that monitoring and such recommendations and reverse QMV sanctions are to be part of the new stability pact anyway, this is perhaps just a call to create a separate budgetary commissioner for this role, plus that of being able to kick someone out of the euro as the final straw?

In any case, the Comission is already unhappy about that last point:

They deliberately set out to break Yugoslavia and stimulate national tensions.

Now walking into another form of some kind of forced economic unity but on a much bigger scale may seem like a great idea, but I think it poses exactly the same risks that could lead to future disharmony.

The UK was taken into Europe on the idea that it was simply a trading pact, but the EU idea is far bigger than that, and I personally believe it poses exactly the same kind of future risk of separation, more so. This idea strikes me as an incredibly dangerous and artificial concept, it seems be an attempt to enact political dogma over common sense and what the people want. I have no problem with any other country but you are croatia and you deserve to run your country in the way that suits your people, as do the french or the italians and every other country.

I predict forced economic and political union will only end up seeing more of this.

een parallel worden getrokken met de rol die de Commissaris mededinging speelt
bij het toezicht op de interne markt. De interne markt regelgeving wordt door de
Raad, op voorstel van deze Commissaris en na raadpleging van het Europese
Parlement vastgesteld. De Commissie houdt volledig zelfstandig toezicht op de
naleving van deze regelgeving. Bedrijven en lidstaten kunnen bij het Europese Hof
van Justitie in beroep gaan tegen de genomen besluiten en de opgelegde sancties.
Het Europarlement kan controle uitoefenen door gebruik te maken van de
algemene bevoegdheden die het EP heeft.

am I understanding this correctly - he wants a commissioner to impose the fines by him/herself, and if some country has a problem w this, they can complain to the court of justice, and the parliament can if dissatisfied organize an inquiry, and in the end censure him? I think the latter is untrue, the parliament can only censure the commission as a whole, not individual commissioners unless the commission president agrees also, so it can only be a request to the commission president.  

He compares this w competition commissioner - the rules are set by the council and the parliament, but enforcing them, including giving fines for breaking the competition regulation is exclusively in the hands of the commission.

IF this is what he wants, which is what was basically talked about as automatic penalties, he's just totally unrealistic. A semi-automatic penalty system, one where the council still gets a reverse qualified majority vote to reject the penalties the commission advocates turns out to be a hard thing to pass, the parliament and the council are still negotiating that one. And he wants automatic penalties too?

I understand he wants this in parallel to the reverse QMV system of fines via the stability pact, but I don't understand the difference.

&gt;1) In eerste instantie kan deze Commissaris lidstaten bij herhaaldelijk overtreden
van de eisen van het SGP verplichten gebruik te maken van de ramingen van de
Commissie en een dwingend aanpassingspad voor het begrotingstekort
voorschrijven. Dit in de context van de monitoring per kwartaal door de Ecofin
Raad als eerder genoemd, om te voorkomen dat lidstaten te veel tijd nemen voor
zij op een reëel aanpassingspad komen.

&gt;2) In een volgende stap, als de maatregelen in de eerste stap niet tot verbetering
leiden, zou een lidstaat bindend opgelegd kunnen krijgen om maatregelen te
nemen om de overheidsfinanciën op orde te brengen. Daarbij is een mogelijkheid
dat er een standaard sluitregel voor de begroting van de betreffende lidstaat
wordt opgelegd (bijvoorbeeld het verhogen van belastinginkomsten en/of het
verlagen van overheidsuitgaven), waaraan de lidstaten zich ex ante
gecommitteerd hebben. In deze fase kunnen ook sancties gekoppeld aan de
inkomstenzijde van de begroting worden getroffen. Er is al afgesproken dat
betalingen uit de Cohesie en Structuurfondsen verder afhankelijk worden gemaakt
van naleving van afspraken. Nederland zal inzetten op meer sanctiemogelijkheden
door omgekeerde besluitvorming en hogere sanctiepercentages. In aanvulling
daarop kan de hoogte van de bijdrage aan de begroting afhankelijk worden
gemaakt van de mate waarin een lidstaat voldoet aan de eisen uit het SGP.
Cohesie- en structuurfondsen worden vooraf getoetst op hun bijdrage aan
economische convergentie en alleen ingezet voor structuurversterkende
maatregelen (zoals ook door Frankrijk en Duitsland in de brief aan Van Rompuy
wordt voorgesteld).

this is coming out quite garbled by the translate.google - so first they just demand some kinds of adjustments, no extra penalties yet - or are these orders legally binding as if the country's executive gave them? I really don't understand how they could be w/o a treaty change; where is the legal basis for EU to be deciding community-method style about fiscal matters - the only thing there, is a clearly intergovernmental stability pact, and he seems to be specifically suggesting this as separate and in addition to the stability pact mechanisms.

Next step, any money they get from cohesion funds is suspended unless they obey, right? and in addition to this, the Council can by reverse qualified majority voting impose a further fine on the recommendation of the commission, as is currently planned. OK, well it may make sense for the commission alone to decide on penalizing a country w EU's budget only w/o a council vote on it, since she is the executive of that budget.

The last phase is basically we vet your budget, and you lose your voting rights or you get kicked out of the euro? Which is complete wishful thinking on his part since it requires a treaty change.",0,1315591087,null,0,true,0,c2inszs,t3_k821s,t1_c2inszs,t1_c2imfjq,1427579165,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

2) 1: the commissary can force the member state to use the numbers and stats that the statistic bureau of the commission came up with and not their own. This to ensure that no tricks can be used.

2) 2: If the member state fails to comply to budgetary rules and has been through step 1 without showing any improvement, the member state can be forced to adopt measures to sort out its budgetary problems.  If needed, the member state can also be fined. 


He speaks about how member states that fail to comply with budget rules can be forced to pay more contribution to the EU. He says that payments out of the cohesion and structure funds will be made more dependant on how well a nation complies to the budgetary rules (sorry, I don't know anything about this so I can't elaborate.)

The uni canteens are about as upscale as eating out gets for me, so no ideas on restaurants (maybe try the harbour), but if you're just going for a drink and don't mind something a bit studenty (most students will probably still be away anyway), you should head to the Kuhviertel (i.e. Rosenplatz, Kreuzstraße and Jüdefelderstraße, in the very northwest of the old town).

I'm not sure I'll be in Münster next week, but feel free to pm me if you want to meet for a beer or need someone to show you around and I'll let you know.

Don't rely on the US$ being strong - it's been in serious trouble for quite some time . If the Euro crashes or breaks up France should be ok. - it's one of the strong core countries .

Exchange rates don't reflect relative values . They are a measure of the flow of money - how strongly a country's currency is , hence goods and services are , in demand . As the US$ becomes weaker things will be more expensive in other countries . However incomes in those countries should be higher .

But seriously, since you say that you've never rented abroad before, please be extra careful for the first couple of kilometers. I've driven cars in a couple of countries, and the Autobahn can be quite different. If you're from the UK, you'll probably have to get used to driving in the right lane at first as well (I always find using the other lane than I'm used to very irritating).

There's a speed limit on large sections of the Autobahn, but where there isn't, people *will* drive as fast as they want (especially the BMW, Mercedes and Audi folks). That means that if you're in the right lane going 130 (km) and you want to overtake the car in front, please look in the mirror twice so you can see how fast the cars behind you on the left lane are coming at you - they may well be going 200 and will be behind you a lot quicker than you think, which can lead to dangerous situations.

If you're on the left lane and there's someone behind you who's either driving dangerously close to you or flashing their lights, that means they want you to get out of their way. Either behaviour is forbidden, but you see it quite often anyways. I'd recommend to just calmly get into the right lane at the next chance and let the assholes pass. Do not let them push you to go faster than you're comfortable and don't anger them even more by driving extra slow (that's forbidden too, you have to drive in the right lane unless you're overtaking), it's just not worth it.

Other than that I hope you have a pleasant trip! If you can, get off the Autobahn for a couple of km and take a look at the countryside. And take plenty of breaks so you don't get exhausted.

Pap.fr works well if you have the time to call people (and speak French), and are available on site to visit a lot
I also found some apartments on Craigslist (visited a few - rented one for 6 months) that tend to have the benefit of being furnished. (Like any Craigslist add tho, be mindful of scams - anything with rent by the week is no good). Advantage is people usually speak English then.
Your employer should be able to help you, ask them to post an add in the teacher's lounge?

The main issue might be to have a deal on renting a place if you cannot visit it / sign it. You might have to consider some temporary logding while you're on site and available for visits (people like to see who they're renting their apartment to). 
Otherwise you'd have to go through an agency and will have to pay agency fee. Friend of mine found his place on seloger.com (you pay a fee for getting the numbers, but as it's not free fewer people do it).

* Freep'Star - 8 rue Sainte-croix de la bretonnerie/61 rue de la Verrerie/20 rue de Rivoli. It can get very crowded (basically all the Parisian hipsters shop here) and you definitely have to dig to find good stuff, but it's great if you have some time on your hands

* Various shops around rue de la Verrerie. There's a bunch of them, including the aforementioned Freep'Star.
 
* Guerrisol - 19 Avenue de Clichy. Great prices (shoes for less than 5 euros), the atmosphere is very different from thrift stores in le Marais, but that's kind of refreshing. Once again, be ready to spend hours digging through piles of clothes

For stuff other than clothes, you can go to the marché aux puces de saint-ouen (métro 4 Porte de Clignancourt) or the less famous marché aux puces de la porte de Vanves (métro 13 Porte de Vanves). For ""vide-greniers"" (equivalent of garage sales), check out [this website (in French)](http://vide-greniers.org/agendaDepartement.php?departement=75).

Anyway Greece will probably partially default on it's debt to banks (say pay only 40%-60% of the principal), while paying the money it received from the IMF-EU-ECB. Maybe followed by a nationalization of the main banks inside Greece (which means that in practice it only defaults on foreign banks). It would still have to close the deficit instantaneously and impose some kind of bank holiday. Unless the troika helps them and they receive a second bailout, in which case they don't need to close the deficit instantaneously. Without any external help returning to the drachma is an option, it would start paying all state employees in drachmas, and maybe convert the bank deposits.

if you mean during the crisis, then no; their debt hasn't been any more sustainable since its true extent was discovered when the previous, fraudulent government lost the elections. Re defaulting, in a partial way it is set to try to do that 'voluntary' but it could still be unsustainably high after. In any case, it will hardly need less help after a default so not sure what's your point ...

&gt;country that has no intention whatsoever to implement any austerity measures? The ECB and the IMF walked out in exasperation of Greece just last week withholding yet more funds.

That's totally unfair; Greek government has pushed through quite severe austerity measures, despite strong public opposition, like: VAT increases, extra taxes on luxury goods, and new ""solidarity levy"", cuts to public sector pay, 150,000 public-sector jobs to be cut, €50bn of asset sales... Patching up a budget before being on your way out of a crisis though is quite a difficult thing, and for Greece there's no growth in sight. 

Its based on less negative growth projections ( by IMF etc) that Greece's targets for lowering deficit were made, and it indeed seems to be slipping below them. Given this revenue shortfall, indeed Greece has announced introducing some more taxes, which will unlock the next tranche (so I guess they bowed down to creditor's demands - http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110912-705542.html ). In any case, IMF making bad projections is hardly Greece's fault...

I'm not sure what news you're referring to when claiming ECB and the IMF walked out 'in exasperation of Greece' (maybe somethinj like this: ""A visit by a mission of ECB (European Central Bank), EU and IMF (International Monetary Fund) officials ended abruptly last Friday as Greece reportedly did not want to pursue an additional €1.7 billion worth of new austerity measures."") imho this is nothing more than haggling over the price. and given the harsh recession, its quite legitimate to ask how much austerity starts becoming counterproductive even for the fiscal viability of the country. So, again, what they need is some growth. or less recession at least, hence the OP's calls. Re buying Irish etc, frankly, you'll manage fine w/o any special 'ethical buying'', at least your public budget, and otherwise, could go through quite a lot of hardship before your average purchasing power approached the low of mine..

You are right that the Greek (at the moment) have lower salaries, but they also have lower productivity and as someone said, an overbloated civil service. Do you mean it should be at the same level? Who is going to pay for that?

Also, if you want to compare, the corruption in Greece is higher than in northern Europe, so a lot of the taxes do not get paid. [Here](http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/results) is a link to one of Transparency Internationals reports. So, when northern Europe raise the taxes,everybody pays - is that the case in Greece? Isn't one of the problems that the taxes actually do not get paid?

I know that Greece is going threw a tought time, but to say that they get taxed into oblivion is a bit harsh, when the taxes (if they get paid) are lower than in the countries that are helping Greece (and get paid to a much lesser degree).

I'm complete in agreement that tax evasion is a huge problem, but raising taxes is meaningless counter to that, the more you tax, the more  tax people will attempt to avoid it, especially if there is a history/culture of doing just that. You need a deep tax reform and combat the tax fraud, that would bring much more revenue than raising taxes and should be the priority.

But I think what is being done to Greece is not right, throwing 1/3 of the country to poverty, and a unemployment rating that went up 40% from last year (june 2011 data probably so worse now) is destroying the country.
