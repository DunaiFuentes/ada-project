true,Britzer,GERM,Germany,"I was mainly trying to convey that those 'issues' are more one 'industry issues' and have nothing to do with the common good of the people. The EU farming industry has certain interests that the Iceland farming industry will have to comply to. In return the Iceland farming industry will get EU subsidies. Since agro-business subsidies have come under attack both from the payers for their size (and mismanagement) and from the sheer number of new farmers sharing the same cake (all those new member countries) it isn't as attractive anymore. 

Even though agro business was very good in lobbying, they have been overtaken in recent years by other industries like the financial or electric power industry. And I always thought that here is where the beef is with Iceland in recent days. Because they wreaked so much havoc in the Iceland economy that they managed to topple a government (in the long run) and got themselves some stiff regulation that they managed to avoid in the EU (thank you Gordon Brown!). And now we are facing the Euro crises, because of that. So Europe doesn't even look all that appealing anymore.

Those are all very complex issues and always have been to some extent. The main attraction of the EU has always been emotional, rather than rational. Like national pride. First it was about France and Germany not getting into another war, then about democracy in Spain, Portugal and Greece and lifting the latter two out of poverty (that worked, well, didn't it?). Then about integrating Eastern Europe into Europe and celebrating the end of the cold war. That is an ongoing project. And the only explanation how Bulgaria and Romania became members. Everyone that knew those countries knew they weren't ready. Especially Bulgarians and Romanians that had seen the EU and/or lived there. They were/are as ready for the EU as Greece was/is ready for the Euro. But luckily they are too small to crash, or threaten, the EU like Greece is threatening the Euro. 

Ensuring peace, bringing Europe closer together. Those are the big issues. That is why we are currently negotiating with Croatia and Serbia. The reasons why Turkey won't get in is about culture. Not about economy or policy (I personally think we should give Turkey a date and a set of stable goals to achieve, since I believe the culture is compatible, hell they got the latin alphabet, the Serbians don't).

While negotiations about farming subsidies is going on, the big question if Iceland will join, remains emotional. That is how Norway, in the end, decided against it. They didn't *feel* like it. Iceland was occupied by Denmark. Does Iceland *feel* like joining?",0,1319179209,null,0,true,0,c2t8744,t3_kkg87,t1_c2t8744,t1_c2t62w9,1427761828,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,NeverWise,null,null,"Splitting the Euro would exactly reproduce all the difficulties against which it was initially introduced. E.g. high volatility, exchange rate changes (and thus insecurity for industry and trade), dependence of traders on changing money (costs a lot), less strength of the Euro, higher risk of default / inflation, ...

Secondly, the split would not reduce any of the current problems: It would merely shift them a bit, to a different level. E.g. Italy won't want the same amount of inflation / money printed as Greece and you are back to square zero.

Thirdly there is not really any clear line who is who. All EU countries have debt problems (just like the US which btw has much larger ones). Who really is the weak and the strong? There will always be differences left.

So, you see, practically the split sounds great in the media and from right-wing politicians who as usual promise things that don't hold true. 

But all that is just part of the story. The other side is this: The EU is a dream come true. For generations people dreamt of a united Europe, of a peaceful Europe, of a Europe where you can move, trade, work and speak completely freely. The Euro was an incredible step, away from small weak currencies to a transnational currency, the first true one of its kind - and to give up that project would be a setback for a lot of ideals, dreams and efforts. The Euro and the EU represent much more than they are, and that alone is something most would hate to see die.

There are other plans btw - eg Greece could still go bankrupt and banks could have a forced capital increase (that is, the state force-buys parts of the banks and they in return have cash. When the banks are stable again the state sells the assets back to the bank) to prevent the problems. We will see what Merkel and Sarkozy decide, but one thing is clear: If Sarkozy wins (the rescue fund can get as much money as it wants, whenever it wants) it will be difficult to ever explain to people again why their country has to avoid debt - since they will be bailed out anyway and all share the cost.",0,1319185062,null,0,false,0,c2t8ljn,t3_li21r,t1_c2t8ljn,t3_li21r,1427762015,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

So get rid of all these controls and basically there is no such thing as a lack of demand, as people when allowed will find ways to agree, like barter, gold money, whatever.

* El novio corta su corbata a trozos, la novia su [liga](http://www.elizabethannedesigns.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/wedding-garter-toss.jpg) y venden los trozos a los invitados (el dinero es una ayuda para ese matrimonio).

* Los novios hacen el primer baile.

Aparte de los familiares mayores, abundaba la gente joven (amigos del novio y novia), por lo que la celebración fue más animada que de costumbre:

* Celebración de la boda.
* Cocktail
* Banquete
* Fiesta con barra libre.

6__ Las bodas religiosas. No soy creyente, pero es cierto que las bodas por la iglesia suelen ser más espectaculares, más ""fiestas"" (al menos a las que yo he ido).

7__ Quizá las parejas actuales, en tiempo de crisis (y refiriéndome a las religiosas), prefieren no gastar tanto dinero en celebraciones y ahorrarlo para comenzar ese proyecto conjunto. Estamos, generalmente, menos arraigados a esas tradiciones que la generación anterior.

My remarks have exactly the same logic as the anti-euro remarks. If you think my remarks sound ridiculously stupid, that's exactly how a lot of anti-euro remarks sound.

We're the 9th largest exporter in the world, exporting approximately £260 billion of goods per year (that puts us in top 5% of countries). We export goods worth roughly the entire GDP of Norway, or Iran. Put another way, that's £3,600 worth of goods, per person, per year.

For our size as a country we produce large quantities of:

Oil

Gas

Chemicals (we have the 2nd largest chemical company in the world)

Alcohol

Pharmaceuticals (2nd and 3rd largest companies in the world based in UK)

High tech engineering products

Arms

Yachts, some ships too

Tobacco products

Food products

Fashion/Clothing

and quite a bit of other stuff too.


So...Those exports. 

The myth that British manufacturing is dead is just that, a myth. We are damn good at making stuff. Just because heavy industry is no longer worthwhile when you have to pay people £6.00 an hour doesn't mean we don't manufacture.

Britain manufactures, it does it well, and it does a lot of it.

true,stebbiv,ICEL,Iceland,"You're surprisingly correct. The status-cuo is the fact that Icelandic farmers do get the highest farming subsidies in Europe and they might get a chance to keep that status along with Finland if we join.

The current system does not enforce accountability but the CAP does go the other way around. So, while farmers might have to spend more money on bookkeeping under the CAP, at least we know what the money is used for.

What we used to call *The Agriculture Ministry* (until it merged with the Fisheries Ministry a couple of years ago) was essentially a floor with maybe 4-6 corner offices. What keeps every single database, takes care of statistics and even supplies the subsidies themselves is the *Farmers Association*. The EU has commented on this (obviously, this is a ridiculous system) but if you are a huge lobbyist organization you don't want to lose your powers like that, right?.

Speaking of emotional issues, the main * distractions* are in fact emotional, while the attractions like VAT Union for example are in my mind quite rational. We joined the EEA in 1993 along with Norway and we do have to accept a huge number of EU directives into your law without really having a say about it. Iceland has an embassy in Brussels located in the same building as other lobbyists like [Philip Morris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altria_Group).

Norway didn't join for many reasons. One of them is the fact that the countryside was excluded from the debate and in fact the No-Movement basically took over the discussion in some rural areas.

Seal clubbing was also an emotional issue in Norway and some sort of a symbol of national pride for both some Norwegians and angered environmentalists as well. –The exact same thing is happening with whaling in Iceland. Sure, it is a questionable way of killing wild mammals but every nation should be allowed to use their maritime resources in a reasonable manner. The minke whale in Icelandic waters is far from extinct and even though fin whale hunting is indeed questionable due to the fact that it's listed as a globally endangered species it's doing quite well here in the north.

Iceland became self-governed in 1918 (and thus de-facto independent) but left the danish monarchy in 1944 and basically replaced the monarch with an elected president and became *independent*.

Austria under the Habsburg dynasty was not part of the new Germany and thus the major competitor of Prussia was removed from the Empire. Also Prussia had a King not a Kaiser, just FYI.  
Traditionally there were always a few dynasties/states fighting for dominance in the Holy Roman Empire. For example Henry the Lion against Barbarossa. Another source of conflict was religion after the protestant revolution. The 30 year war saw protestant Saxons and Swedes and others fight against the catholic troups of the Kaiser from Austria.  
So after the Post-Napoleon reconstruction, the Revolution of 1848, the Italian independence wars and the Reichseinigungskrieg (Empire-unification-war, I shit you not, that is what we call the war against france in 1870/71), many factors were removed that stood in the way of unification under a absolutist ruler.

If the way you described is how the majority of the UK views this -- there may actually be some hope yet for this ""european crises"" that everyone is going on about. I am quite sure this will work out just fine in the end.. but I just feel that if the UK was a bit more positive about stuff, things would improve much faster.

Like for example.. look at the thing with the backbenchers trying to find a way to make a referendum about if the UK should remain in the EU. We all know that either it will never come to a referendum because people are just fed up of all the ""crap"" and would just vote ""no"" mostly for shits n giggles.. or it would come to a referendum with a ""no"" answer and then you still don't leave the EU -- because lets face it.. the government knows the EU is important to the country. From an outsider perspective it just seems that the UK is not even interested in helping to find ways to resolve the problems right now.. if anything they seem to be making them worse (because of speculation). Even the idea that the UK is considering to leave the EU is much worse than Greece defaulting (as far as the EU is concerned). My Cypriot side is very sad about the situation with Greece (as I'm also fluent in the Greek language).. but my English side hurts quite a bit hearing that the UK may not even want to be part of the family anymore.

You guys are our brothers and sisters even if we fight about certain things (just like family does). Now is the time for unity because together we are stronger. Your concerns are important and I believe that with your input and support the euro and the EU will become much better.

As you should already know.. I'm a hybrid.. half British and half Cypriot. I am not loyal to anyone and I understand that unity is possible and that it's important -- I am proof of it. As time goes on there will be more and more hybrids just like me and at some point countries just won't matter anymore. I may have a British name... British citizenship etc.. but I grew up in a different country (and let me tell you, these people can be a bit weird at times :P)..

I would say that a large majority in this country don't want to be in a federal europe, they would be absolutely content to be in the single market and little more. 

That is why when Britain was asked if it wanted to join the euro, the answer was no, because the question to us wasn't ""Do you want to enter a single currency?"" it was ""Do you want to enter a federal europe?"" and we do not, we viewed the euro as a trap if you will, to enter it was to accept that ultimately we'd be part of a federal europe whether we liked it or not or wanted it or not.

You could say that we foresaw that eventually a crisis would occur and the only solution would be a federal europe of some sort. Well now we are at that point and we understand something else, that at the moment we are half in europe and half out, but frankly as the eurozone integrates our voice in its affairs must ultimately be diluted to the point where it is meaningless. 

So those backbench MP's are articulating a thought in the UK that ultimately it would be better to redefine our role in europe, if we could be a member of the common market but little more that would be ideal, then europe could get on and federalise without us getting in the way.

In the interest of peace and stability, EVERYONE should make compromises and try to keep the average person in every country as happy as possible. Each country usually has about 2 dominant political parties with completely opposite ideologies -- you can't make decisions that EVERYONE will always like. The same applies with the EU -- you can't keep them all happy.. and we can't turn on it just because of a few disagreements.

Imagine if every decision in every country always ended up with riots or civil war.. COMPROMISE :)

The UK is a very powerful and very important country -- not just in the EU but also globally.. but so is Germany, France and even Italy. It's difficult to keep EVERYONE happy. This is why I believe if they changed a few of the treaties so that the majority wins.. even the countries who said no should also follow through with the decision.. because look at what happens when a single country holds up a decision just for attention.. it's quite a facepalm moment.

Y-chromosome haplogroup O3 is a common DNA marker in Han Chinese, as it appeared in China in prehistoric times. It is found in more than 50% of Chinese males, and ranging up to over 80% in certain regional subgroups of the Han ethnicity.[30] However, the mitochondrial DNA of Han Chinese increases in diversity as one looks from northern to southern China, which suggests that some male migrants from northern China married with women from local peoples after arriving in Guangdong, Fujian, and other regions of southern China.[31][32] Despite this, tests comparing the genetic profiles of northern Han, southern Han and southern natives determined that haplogroups O1b-M110, O2a1-M88 and O3d-M7, which are prevalent in southern natives, were only observed in some southern Hans (4% on average), but not in northern Hans. Therefore, this proves that the male contribution of southern natives in southern Hans is limited.[12] In contrast, there are consistent strong genetic similarities in the Y chromosome haplogroup distribution between the southern and northern Chinese population, and the result of principal component analysis indicates almost all Han populations form a tight cluster in their Y chromosome. Additionally, the estimated contribution of northern Hans to southern Hans is substantial in both paternal and maternal lineages and a geographic cline exists for mtDNA. As a result, the northern Hans are the primary contributors to the gene pool of the southern Hans. However, it is noteworthy that the expansion process was dominated by males, as is shown by a greater contribution to the Y-chromosome than the mtDNA from northern Hans to southern Hans. These genetic observations are in line with historical records of continuous and large migratory waves of northern China inhabitants escaping warfare and famine, to southern China. Aside from these large migratory waves, other smaller southward migrations also occurred during almost all periods in the past two millennia. Moreover, a study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences into the gene frequency data of Han subpopulations and ethnic minorities in China, showed that Han subpopulations in different regions are also genetically close to the local ethnic minorities, and it means that in many cases blood of ethnic minorities has mixed into Han, while at the same time, blood of Han also has mixed into the local ethnicities.[33] A recent, and to date the most extensive, genome-wide association study of the Han population shows that little geographic-genetic dispersion from north to south has occurred.[34] Ultimately, with the exception in some ethnolinguistic branches of the Han Chinese, such as Pinghua, there is a coherent genetic structure in all Han Chinese populace.[35]""",0,1319238562,null,0,false,0,c2teqsl,t3_lijfd,t1_c2teqsl,t1_c2tcdvb,1427765005,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

This empire might not work purely in the interests of the American people but it is a global empire and the American president is its figurehead.

Talking about empires might seem anachronistic for today's media but in foreign policy think thanking Americas status as an empire is accepted at face value and especially the Americans themselves aren't particularly shy about  it.

Mal im Ernst, ich gehöre ohnehin nicht einmal zum erweiterten Sympatisantenkreis dieser Partei, aber ich habe im Sinne des Liberalismus immer die Meinung vertreten, dass jeder seine Meinung kundtun darf. Dieser Vorschlag jedoch ist schlicht und einfach unverantwortlich. Legalisierung erleichtert in jedem Fall den Einstieg (Nach dem Motto, ich versuchs halt mal) und schafft einen Bruch im bestehenden Rechtsempfinden (Stichwort: Normenerrosion). Letzteres gilt einerseits für das Verhältnis zwischen Staat und Bürger im Bezug auf die Schutzpflicht des Staates (Ja, die gibts theoretisch tatsächlich) und andererseits wird somit auch ein Präzendenzfall geschaffen, eine Vielzahl von weiteren (durchaus sinnvollen) Verboten zu hinterfragen. Eine solche Entwicklung halte ich weder für gesellschaftlich wünschenswert noch ist sie akzeptabel. 

Aber vllt. halten Teile der Partei doch lieber an Fantastereien fest, anstatt sich harten Realitäten zu stellen und praktikable Lösungen zu schaffen.

Allerdings hinkt die verstärkte Bezugnahme auf Cannabis an dieser Stelle. ich wende mich nicht gegen die Legalisierung von Cannabis, du hast recht, wenn man Alkohol und Tabak legalisiert hat, dann kann man es eigentlich auch mit Cannabis machen. Allerdings will ich auch Cannabis nicht mit Heroin oder Kokain auf Stufe stellen, deren Auswirkungen deutlich desaströser sind.  Eines der Argumente diese Legalisierung zu fordern, war ja, dass die Grenze zwischen zwischen verbotenen und legalen Substanzen zu willkürlich sei. Nehmen wir nun an, wir heben diese Verbote auf. Wo sollten wir die neue Grenze ziehen? Eigentlich könnte man keine neue Grenze ziehen, weil jedes neue Verbot genauso willkürlich erscheinen müsste wie das alte. Das heißt, man müsste, sofern man konsequent ist, jede Droge legalisieren bis hin zu den feinen Neuentwicklungen aus Osteuropa, die im wesentlichen aus Erkältungsmedikamenten und Aceton bestehen und die Menschen von innen auflösen (siehe KROK). Dies kann nun wirklich keine Option sein!

Zum Thema Cannabisapotheken nennst du das erste Problem bereits selbst: Kontrolle. Ich denke nicht, dass sich jeder Süchtige dieser Kontrolle aussetzen will, zum Teil aus guten Gründen (etwa Beschaffungskriminalität). Zum Zweiten stellt sich die Frage woher die dann angebotenen Drogen kommen sollen? Natürlich kann man sich sicher langfristig eine Eigenproduktion zulegen (Viele Schmerzmittel basieren schließlich auf Opiumbasis), aber welchen Preis sollte man dann verlangen? Umsonst und auf Rezept? Eher nicht, zumal die entstehenden Kosten ja bei irgendwem hängenbleiben. Also muss es einen kostendeckenden Marktpreis geben... du kannst sicher sein, das der Schwarzmarkt weiter bestehen bleibt und seine Drogen weiterhin anbieten wird, knapp unter dem offiziellen Marktpreis würde ich voraussagen (Bei Zigaretten ist das ja genauso, die sind legal, aber es wird immer mehr geschmuggelt). Nun könnten wir natürlich beginnen die Drogen bei den schon bestehenden Herstellern zu kaufen. Mal abgesehen von der Tatsache das man keinem Steuerzahler verkaufen könnte, dass man mit seinem Geld den Drogenhandel unterstützt, würden man hier auch Konflikte mit den Abnehmern in den Kartellen schüren. Was wäre dann die Folge, ein neuer Opiumkrieg? Wenn schon alles aufschreit, wenn man noch halbwegs gerechtfertigte Interventionen in Afghanistan und im Kosovo unterstützt hat, dann möchte ich sehen was dann los ist. Und das Kartelle es mit Staaten aufnehmen können zeigt in diesen Tagen das Beispiel Mexiko.

Davon abgesehen heißt Liberalismus nicht, dass jeder tun und lassen kann was er will. Wie es so schön heißt: Die eigene Freiheit endet immer da wo die Freiheit des anderen anfängt. Die mit dem Konsum harter Drogen einhergehenden Folgen halte ich für potentiell so gefährlich, dass sie diese Freiheit der anderen bedrohen, von den selbstzerstörerischen Folgen einmal abgesehen.

&gt;The rich will send their kids to good schools, but the poor won't be able to afford this. I had hoped this kind of society was a thing of the past.

Indeed, but the problem is that financial services are actually worth quite a lot, where-as the jobs that low skilled service or manufacturing workers in this country do are artificially kept incredibly highly paid. Cleaners and lunch ladies and all the other min. wage folk think it's terrible that bankers and financiers earn what they do, but at least they're actually worth that to the world (rightly or wrongly, they are). We could have cleaners from India or Bangladesh or some other shit hole working for a £5-10 a day, not £6 an hour.

Globalisation is redefining the idea that you have rich countries and poor countries, what we're going to get is rich people and poor people, spread all over the place. The low skilled workers in a country like the UK are just simply too numerous, and too expensive for what they actually do, which is nothing that some person from the far east wouldn't do just as well for 5%-10% of the cost.

It's utterly unfair to children born into poverty, totally meritocratic, and completely without social mobility. I'm not sure it's a world I want to live in, but it is a world I accept is fairly inevitable at this point.

In a global economy as serious as ours I suspect the FSI has a long long time to go before it becomes redundent. Having large organisations stocked with people who know an awful lot about banking, investment, the markets, corporate strategy, etc. is a very valuable thing.

&gt;Electronics used to be high up, but I bet your smartphone was made in China.

My shitphone was made in Finland :(

&gt;Eventually, even financial services will go where the customers are, because their Asian clients like to sleep during the night.

This is a possibility, hence why we need to be competitive. Ultimately of course the world is going to flatten out and few countries are going to have wide scale advantages over others. For instance right now China makes loads of stuff but doesn't really have a mature FSI, so we do a lot of that for them. Once they get their own FSI, we'll probably be better at times, and them at times, so we'll all have to share the pie. In the UK we basically have to hope that the rate at which the pie grows in size correlates with the rate at which we have to increasingly share it, otherwise our standard of living is going to enter a serious decline.

In the UK we don't bet everything on one horse, but the financial capital of the world has to be *somewhere*, and right now it happens to be London, and that makes us lots of money and that's a good thing. Britain is a small country with high population density, a decent education and healthcare system, highly functioning infrastructure, and a large graduate class in it's society. These attributes are a big part of the reason we have the FSI in the UK, but they're also very flexible attributes which should allow the country to rapidly refocus if the need arises.",0,1319296736,null,0,false,0,c2tjcga,t3_ljohw,t1_c2tjcga,t1_c2tj6kt,1427767175,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

&gt;If you have another look at [1] the table I had linked to above, you'll find that there are many countries with a competitive industry where manufacturing workers are payed much better than in the UK. We (Europe) should try to compete through innovation, quality and productivity, not cost.

No doubt, they're just like us though, they're exporting expensive things which are complicated to make. 42% of EU exports are complex machinary and transportation products (think aircraft, high quality cars, trains, ships). Another big part of what we do is produce high quality chemical products. We don't make low grade steel, we don't produce tables, or even electronic equipment any more.

While of course we can compete by applying some of our good qualities as an economic entity, there are certain tasks which are so simple and refined already that basically short of complete automation, which is not technologically feasible yet, we're not going to be able to compete with the rest of the world. We've priced ourselves out of these markets, essentially. By having a minimum wage which is massively higher than what the market rate for a job is, we can not compete with those who work for the market wage, and in industries which rely on plenty of unskilled labour just aren't going to exist in the UK unless absolutely necessary.

&gt;. But another consequence of globalization is the emergence of industry clusters around infrastructure like know-how and suppliers. We should try to retain some industries while we still have them, so that financial services have somebody to service.

Well, currently most of who they service are people outside the UK, but we do have expertise in this country. We have a strong high tech manufacturing, engineering, and energy base in this country, and so long as we just make sure we supply these industries with the things they need to compete (intelligent, driven individuals, and not too much interference) they should continue to earn the country a considerable amount of it's money.",0,1319300246,null,0,false,0,c2tjprz,t3_ljohw,t1_c2tjprz,t1_c2tjm9f,1427767348,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,Aevum1,null,null,"Heres the thing. theres ALOT to see. 

where ever you are, you can get to sol quickly by taking the cercanias. it will leave you in sol in 5-10 minutes from both main train stations (chanmartin and atocha). 

now from sol you should check out all the old streets behind it. plaza mayor. 

Going from plaza mayor in the direction of the opera metro station you will reach the san miguel food market which is expencive but very nice. if you continue in the same direction (check google maps) you should reach the royal theater and opera house. a bit further in that direction you should reach  plaza de oriente. the sabatini gardens and camo del moro which are all very nice. 

Then get your ass in the metro (it functions untill 2am but the last trains leave at around 1:30 from the start of the lines) and you can either take opera or principe pio. 

If you take opera take it in direccion of las rosas and get off at retiro. that should leave you next to the retiro (do NOT go in at night). check out the park a bit. has the only official monument to the devil that i know of (monumento al angel caido). then go down alcala untill you reach the castellana. 

The 27 bus is a normal line bus (not a tourist bus, but it should be). it travels between atocha and plaza castilla. and the main benefit is that it allows you to see the entire castella with everything on it for a 1.50€. meaning that it passes next to museo del prado. the old central post office (which is also the new city hall). plaza colon. the santiago bernabeu soccer stadium. cibeles.  nuevos ministerios. and other madrid landmarks. i suggest you check out this link 
http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%ADnea_27_%28EMT_Madrid%29

and compare it against google maps to see where you should take the bus to get the best effect. if you take it near alcala you might miss some stuff. 


Another leg of the tour if you have time should be before going to sol you can go to alonso martinez and go down to barquillo. then plaza de chueca (gay district of madrid, which btw, theres an excelent ice cream shop on the plaza called bonata). visit the san anton food market which was just renovated and then take the small streets up to fuencarral which is a nice walking street with avangard shops mixed with alternative culture (but beware of the transvestite hookers at night), you should be aware that if its a weekend and evening chueca is going to be packed so going tribunal gran via from alonso would be a wiser choice. 

Once on gran via you can access sol through montera which is famous for its hookers (look but dont touch). or you can walk up gran via and enter by callao which is a classical comercial district. theres a half decent ramen place crossing the street from calao but thats another issue.  walking down callao where the fnac and corte ingles is you should reach sol. 

Feel free to make questions. 

From all of that. i do recommend that the most priority should be put in the sol-opera-campo del moro leg. 

And you should atleast ride the 27 for a bit, a 10 ride pass costs 9,30€, beware of pickpockets and romian gypsys (it sounds a bit racist but they are responsible for around 85% of the street crime right now).

sometimes they will have you look at a map while the partner is coming for your wallet from behind and sometimes they will just shove their hand in to your pocket or bags if they see you´re a tourist. so travel light and try to travel with a phone, cash/cards and ID in a place you can control it and with as little bags on you as possible.

I couldn't agree more, however, consideration has to be taken of the funding of these students.

Students coming to Scotland from the rest of the EU, and further afar, do not constitute a significant strain on resources, however, English students make up over 40% of some of our institutions - with the prospect of this number increasing when England chose not to fund its students' tuition fees.

The removal of this funding from England's budget meant that Scotland also lost ALL of its funding (our budget is based on the English budget multiplied by a population %) and we have had to find the money to provide free education for Scottish students from elsewhere in our budget. To protect places for Scottish students at our own universities we have had to resort to charging fees for students form the rest of the UK (RUK).

Many more Master programs use English as the course language. When you think about it, it's actually pretty clever -- after having lived here for two years, they will be fluent in the language, have made local contacts with fellow students that will help them later in their career, maybe they'll be in a relationship… as a result, quite a number of them will stay, or at the very least end up being good business contacts for those who do.  
So, we get highly qualified immigrants that will spend their productive lives here, create jobs, pay taxes and into the social insurances, and have kids (we don't have enough of our own). Even though some of them will go back home after graduation, when you compare the cost of putting somebody through two years at uni to that of their entire education up to this point, it pays off if just a fraction of them ends up staying.

true,thelittlebig,NISA,Niedersachsen,"What is the context of this possibility to ask a question?  
Should the question be about: Diplomacy as a job?, The economic crisis and other political topics?, US-American/German relationship?  

If you were to ask about diplomacy itself, then I would suggest asking about the impact of modern communication (Internet, twitter, etc.) on diplomacy. In an age where it is possible to contact almost everyone at any time and make almost any information public at any time, how has diplomacy changed? Has it eventually become more democratic?  
You could also ask about Europe in this context, Europe now has Mrs. Ashcroft(?) as a representative for foreign affairs. How does the European Integration affect diplomacy on a national level? How does Germany being the (lets face it) most powerfull country in the EU affect diplomacy on a European level?  

When asking about the economy, you could ask him if he thinks the way the Europeans are trying to manage the crisis is right. Specifically I would refer to the fact, that right now the crisis is managed by the so called Berlin-Paris Achse and diplomats in general, instead of letting the European Parliament take a more central role.  

You could also ask him, if and how the USA are taking part in managing the debt-crisis, since due to the global nature of banking and rating agencies their country is very much involved in the crisis.

If the USA/Germany relationship were the topic you could refer to the fact, that after Schröder it was said that the relationship between our two countries improved under Mrs. Merkel. Yet Germany refused military cooperation in Libya under Mr. Westerwelle. How does Germany's rather peacefull non-interventional style impact the transatlantic relationship.

After being in Germany a year and returning home, one of the first surprises was that the only common German beer you can buy in the states is Becks, one of Anheuser-Busch InBev' companies (also including Stella Artois, Boddingtons, Beck's, St. Pauli Girl, Staropramen, Bass, Leffe, Labatt and Hoegaarden).  The second surprise was the VAST varieties of so-called craft beers now available in the US.  Went to several NYC and Boston pubs after coming home and tried a variety.  There are quite a few extremely hoppy beers that are almost undrinkable.  By the time you get away from the hoppy ones and the stouts, well, your pretty much back to traditional German-style pils and weißbiers.  I finally settled on Shipyard Summer Ale and drank that pretty much all summer.  

In Germany, my favorite is Kölsch (the beer of Köln), couldn't find anything like that in the States.  Come to find out, the word was the American braumeisters had decided they couldn't do it- too complicated to produce it was said.  Hence my impression that most of the US braumeisters are basically figuring things out as they go (i.e. experimenting) rather than relying on centuries of development as in Europe.  The CW in Germany is that basically beers ""don't travel well,"" meaning that beers should really be local products serving a community rather than distributed internationally.  So most German Gasthausen and Oktoberfests are only going to have 3-4 different brews on tap, and they'll be local.  Beer is, after all, really about facilitating social connections and washing down good food.  Actually, in Germany they consider beer to BE food.

That said, it will be interesting to see how the craft beer movement in the US plays out over time.  My experience this summer back home was that the US craft beers WERE actually quite local.  On the other hand, since back, we went to a pub in Liege, Belgium where they must have had a menu with 40 pages of beers, almost 30 taps and 1000 different bottled beers- and there was not one American beer on the list.",0,1319392614,null,0,true,0,c2tspv6,t3_lf21x,t1_c2tspv6,t3_lf21x,1427771743,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

as for the hidden inflation... yes, I'm glad that we woke up, but the political corruption has to be eliminated.

Well, that's why I said that I wasn't aware of the insurance situation of financial institutions. You seem to forget, first of all, that many people might have more than 100,000 Euros in the bank. In the USA, they don't... According to an Australian news story I saw the other day, the average net worth of people in the USA is about $60,000, which is quite a small amount. Ours is a country where people spend their money rather than saving it; the average net worth of Australians on the other hand is about $250,000.

Furthermore, what happens when many major banks go bust at once in a huge financial disruption... and the federal governments are already in over their heads in debt and the treasury cupboard is bare, so to speak? Given how I've seen them respond to the investment banking crisis... I have no doubt that they'll do their best to honour the insurance claims. However, it might be through printing new money, which can potentially cause hyperinflation. This is why there's so much concern over the Greek government going into default - not to mention Italy, Spain, and Ireland.

Then I'd like to correct your view on Swiss banks. Swiss bank secrecy was introduced in the 30ies to prevent the Nazis from confiscating German money placed in Switzerland. Remember that the government isn't always run by the good guys. Also, for example Qaddafi did not have much money in Switzerland and the Swiss banks were among the first to freeze the few accounts he had there. If you were a dictator, I would recommend you places like Singapore or the Cayman Islands, but not Switzerland. What you believe about Swiss banks is largely a myth conveyed by Hollywood.

The reason the Swiss are neutral is because it helped them staying out of wars. If you think the Swiss are rich because of the banks, think again. The Swiss are rich because they did not participate in the world wars. Unlike others, they did not have to start from scratch in the late 40ies. Furthermore, it helps a lot to have a stable and well-balanced political system.

Btw: Swiss citizens have the highest tax honesty in the world. Even though the Swiss have to declare their taxes themselves and it is no crime to forget to declare something, the Swiss tend to pay their taxes more honestly than anyone else. This is because the tax system is considered quite fair and the tax payers know that their money is spent comparatively wisely and is not used to finance a distant bureaucracy.

You would also be able to bind files to specific hardware etc..

Every time it comes up, it gets shot down (look for the history on 'Trusted Computing'). It would seem the Germans have been against it the most for very good reason.

What is interesting to note is that a lot of the new hardware that has been coming out already support a form of this 'Trusted Computing'. Lets just hope it never becomes law to actually use it.. all you need to generate quadrillions of euros of market growth (/s).. is a combination of enforced 'Trusted Computing' and ACTA... that's when you start looking at getting a monthly 'Intellectual Property' bill at some point in the future...

You need to remember... a lot of these cocksuckers wouldn't mind implementing an automatic system where you would pay royalties automatically for anything you view... Saw a Metallica video on youtube? fuck you.. 10 cents on your next bill for each time you viewed it (but ye... it'd probably be much higher than that) :) ..but under such a system you could probably easily get a bill for 100 euros+ if they ever went such a route.. It seems that the ad industry is researching ways to make you pay for internet services (such as newspapers etc) with some form of new microtransaction crap (which would probably be implemented through your ISP bill somehow).

So no.. 'Trusted Computing' is the kind of thing that companies like Apple use. Their abuse of DRM is the reason I will never buy any of their overpriced products. ""Oh but.. you can install Windows on an apple box"" -- yeah.. right after you buy an overpriced fucking bootloader... ""ah but.. I know a guy who knows a guy.. (you obviously :P).. who can kinda just... do it anyway"".. ye... 'Trusted Computing' says fuck you :)

In the meantime.. as a lot of sane countries are not really allowing them to do this kind of crap, they try to play around with ideas of paying extreme amounts of money per GB transfered through the internet. This kind of thing does not go on in Europe currently as overall it seems the people making the decisions are quite sane and look out for the people.. but in countries such as the USA (and probably in the UK in the future if they keep up with this crap) they are trying to push such stupid crap.. it's also the whole thing about 'Net Neutrality'.. and remember in those countries most of the ISPs are run by content providers. They see that they are losing a lot of revenue on shitty entertainment that nobody wants because people like to use the internet more (reddit anyone? :) than they like paying for shitty movies.

It's all related.. ""Trusted Computing"", ""Net Neutrality"" (net neutrality is good), ACTA etc..

For those that don't know.. if we didn't have net neutrality.. ISPs would be able to do this kind of thing: http://i.imgur.com/ZR6bU.jpg (not to the extremeness of only allowing you to view x amount of sites.. but lets just say you'll be waiting a longer time for a youtube video to load if you didn't pay extra for youtube access for example.. initially the difference wouldn't be much, but over time it would all start becoming worse)

Ah and the funniest thing? The serious pirates would just install modchips on their motherboards and somehow bypass all of this crap.. so the only thing that would even come out of it is that YOU will just pay extra money like a tax if some of these assholes had their own way :)

And that the only reason NATO wanted him dead/ousted was to get the oil doesn't make sense either. At best it is one of many reasons. For instance, he was threatening to kill a lot of people and the rebels wanted someone to help them.

This is what angers me, not at you specifically, but Eurozone. The plan*seems"" to be? *Hopefully*! 

Sweden had a deep financial crises in the 90's and to get the markets trust back, we did crazy things like balancing our budgets, cutting down in the public sector, pay off debt etc. Above all, there was a long term agreement and a plan to be prudent, how quick to pay off debt etc


*Nothing* off that is seen in the current crises. Put all the cards on the table. How much money and for how long - that is the real issue!? What is the prognosis? What is Italys debt going to be in five years? How are you changing bank laws for this not to happen. What happens to someone who doesn't balance budgets etc.


What the Eurozone is doing right now is just putting out small fires, but not killing the underlying one. One ad hoc solution after another. I think it is really bad finacially. No one know where they are going.


I also think it is arrogant and audacious to ask tax payer for money, but not to disclose the full content of the problem, not how you are going to solve it. You serve the tax payers, they do not serve you. I do not understand how the tax payers in the Eurozone stand for it (no, I am not referring to Greece, more the Dutch, Germans etc)


We are not in the Eurozone, but they want money from us. Call me tight, mean and non solidarity, but I hope we do not give them any (although that won't happen). It is not solidarity to give away money to people who will not even disclose how bad it is, nor do they have any sort of plan. In must agree with another Brit - what happens when other peoples money runs out? What is the Eurozone plan then? Make the meetings public if you want my money, put a plan in order.

Well not really, in a participatory democracy such as exists in Greece, your ability to control the system rests with your ability to vote, to campaign, to be involved. If you choose to not be involved and then are annoyed, then that's basically just tough shit.

&gt;Yep, I'm gonna vote for my plumber and he will be the next President. Just like that. Gee, you obviously don't live in a fantasy world. Do you have any idea how the major parties get financed?

So stop fucking voting for them. Convince your neighbours and your friends and your family and your colleagues that all the major parties are as shit as you think they are, and get them to do the same. That's how democracy works, you convince enough people that option X is shit and option Y is better, and then option Y wins out.

&gt;and people vote for them because there are no other options.

That's such a childish get out. No other options meaning the other options are really **god damn hard** is what you mean. I agree with what you're really saying, the other options are really god damn hard, but *really fundamentally* changing the political system of the US would take far more than one person and huge commitment of time and work, but it can be done.

 Should different laws be made for Greeks? Should Greece not be included in the EU/Switzerland free movement of capital agreement?

 I seriously don't understand the outrage limited to Greek depositors over this. And i hate tax evaders with a passion. As Greeks, my family is called to pay more in taxes than they make because of these scum who have been partying all these years. I am in no way defending them here. 

 But it is not the Swiss or the free movement of capital that let this happen. Its the Greek state. They could actually get a single large scale tax evader*, in Greece, before complaining about those with money abroad btw (capital which could or could not have been already taxed - 90% has not of course) or actually sign an agreement with Switzerland to tax the capital (not interest) in all Greek deposits in Switzerland for those clients who want to retain anonymity and dodge an IRS investigation. Everything else is populist political pandering. The government's specialty.

 If you're interested look at what other countries have done for the same issue (USA, UK, Germany). These countries actually get money back from Switzerland, through settlements and taxes even if the way it is done is not totally satisfying in terms of transparency. Greeks just bitch about the fact because any person facing long term poverty is easily outraged at ""rich assholes"" and have no money coming in. A good distraction for the people btw.. Now the press reports about the Greek government and Switzerland agreeing -after 2 years of negotiating- to tax interest earned on capital by 10% (the same rate as within GR). No mention of tax on capital accrued over the years. Imho, this is a big joke, especially as this tax is already in place since the early 2000s AFAIK and can even be avoided, while Switzerland said it will be taxing interest with 35% from 2012. So is this actually a way to make it cheaper for greek depositors? I honestly don't think it will work out this way, but by the recent reports it actualy looks that way. I'm only wishing they actually sign a German style agreement to *heavily* tax capital that wishes to remain anonymous and avoid any questions.
 
 Also the government said it will investigate money transfers to foreign banks, *from 2009 onwards*. Not a word about the past. They will investigate the people who panicked in the IMF era and the prospect of a default and leave all the transfers from all those years to be forgotten. Okay i'm sure a lot of shady transfers are in there, but why leave out the vast majority in the years that actually led to the events of 2009? And to end my rant, Switzerland is known for its low interest. All this fuss about what is peanuts in the grand scheme of things.



 *Just a few days ago the PM himself accused the banks of making loans to a TV station that is 500 million euros in debt (i think 15 of those towards the state) and has recently resumed broadcasting after a few months shut-off. 

 Yes, the channel is 500 million in debt, advertising companies have already closed because of this -never got payed by the station-, and the PM blames the banks. He is the head of state and does nothing about it but blame somebody else. And the outrage is for those who move their money where they want. Not the people in power who talk and talk while taking a back seat in all this.

Well, maybe we are one off the richer better off countries *because* we are balancing our budget. Why do not other countries have to do this? I think (and there is some research on that too, but I am to lazy to look), that if you just hand over money, without demands, forever, then you are not helping, you are actually contributing to the problem. For how long has southern Italy received money? Greece? When do you think they should actually start paying taxes? What year?? What percentage? I think we are contributing to the corruption if we aid them - you do not? If Germany wants to pay money, endlessly to Southern Europe, go ahead, but you should at least understand the sound fincial reasoning behind asking the question  - where is our money going. Also, looking at the German debate, more than one German tax payer understand my reasoning. 


&gt;Personally, I don't like the ""IT'S OUR MONEYS!!!1"" populism that much. Mostly because I see how much Germany benefits from a common market (just like all other countries do, btw), no matter how small the share for the average German is.

That is not an answer to the fact that the Eurozone has no long term finacial plan, don't disclose how much money they need, where there are going or anything. Don't you think that they have to do that? You can still disclose both what you are doing, what you are planning to do and how much money that is needed. Are you saying that we should just hand over money, not ask questions. I do not want to do that - why, if you are not corrupt, can't you disclose information? How come you do not have a plan?

For me is sound financial reasoning to have a plan, and expect others to have one. Seriously, if Germany think they do not need plans, disclosure or anything, I think you are waking down the wrong path, and I'll fight to stay out of the Eurozone. 

Also, again - you blame the Eurozones problems on the UK - that is ludicrious. The problems are much more complex than that.


Second -you want money to the endless black hole that is the Euro, no reassurance, no plan, no nothing, just a vague - ""you are rich, show some solidarity"". Well, shouldn't it be better to give money to  any country basically that can come up with a descent plan (Thailand/China/Vietnam perhaps)), I think it says a lot about the current state of the Eurozone that they don't have one.

Germany, yes, but what about Italy? Greece? Everyone has to balance budgets, not just Northern Europe. And, for entering the Eurozone for example the debt to GDP ration should be 60 %, which no country has (maybe Finland/the Dutch, but certainly not Belgium, Greece) etc.

I did give alternatives. I think you should 
a) disclose how much money the Eurozone need, 

b) sit down a make a financial plan. When is Greece going to be in black, how much do we cut Portugals pensions etc. Disclose that plan. Then follow it.


c) start balancing budgets

d) disclose all the information about the bank, and make laws/plans etc for it not to happen again.

e) stop just handing over money without asking questions, etc


f)start paying off debt etc

Much more that can be done, but you are blaming the UK for what is essentially a complex European/world/Eurozone problem.



What is your suggestions then - hand over money to Merkozy, don't argue? When are you planning to have Greece back in black, and no more aid to Italy? Do you even have a plan?


&gt;Certainly not helping here is egoistic bickering

And your attitude against the Brits? And, as I said, I have nothing against helping out or solidarity, but I don't like throwing money down a black hole.  I think, it should be common financial sense to tell someone a) what you are going to do with the money b) for how long you need it c) how you are planning to /repay/climb out of debt. I do not see that. I think it is rude to call me egoistic, just because I just do not want to join in *your* version of financial planning, that frankly, to my mind seems very lacking, no structure or planning at all, just words, and throwing money ad hoc at problems when they show up

true,Britzer,GERM,Germany,"Greece could have easily gone bancrupt in 2010. Not in some horrible 'no money' way, but an orderly meeting with debtors in which they explain that they don't have any money and need to postpone interest payments and maybe negotiate cutting part of the current debt.

That wasn't possible, because a lot of European banks held too much of that debt and would have failed. So Europe decided to pump a lot of money into Greece, which directly went to said banks. Now that the European public has taken over a lot of that debt at inflated prices and already bailed out the banks (that figure of 50-100 billion is a wild guess) we talk about cutting down on the debt, which will make the debtors (now the public, but also a couple banks) loose a bunch of money. 

All the while a couple other banks earned huge sums of money hedging the crises. That is where the bonuses come from. 

If we had enacted regulations that force the banks to deleverage (and earn less money, but be safer against catastrophic failure), they could more easy take a hit like that without failing. Canadian banks weathered the storm of 2008 fairly well, because they are much less leveraged than European banks thanks to stricter regulation. And ever since the UBS almost bancrupted Switzerland, they also enacted much tougher regulation.

Then you discuss where you going to get the money from, and discuss with donors/lenders (what they are doing now). You also calculate how you are going to get a higher productivity in Greece,what cuts,  estimate when they can start paying back and about a hundred million things more

You do that for each country, and each issue. Then you know (roughly of course) how much you need, and how you should get there. 


Also - you tell people the truth, something the Eurozone hasn't been doing. 

Now - you want us to just hand over money, no plan, no nothing.I've asked you before, but I'd like to know again - what is your plan? For how long, how much? H0w are you going to tackle corruption?

You are claiming that the banks are irresponisible, but at the same time you are without a plan, and you want us to hand over money without security/collateral, or even a plan - exactly why the banks and the Eurozone are in this mess in the first place. Doesn't that strike you as odd/hypocritical?

Well, there is a difference between superficial, optional de-leveraging that was done by the European financial industry over the last years and tough regulation demanding a thorough de-leveraging and other best practice stuff like keeping all investments in your books...

&gt; I am not sure why it wasn't possible for other EU governments to do the same? Perhaps we British felt that it was quite possible for each nations regulators to implement such requirements without regulations needing to be centralised in Brussels?

Because we have a common market. Any somewhat meaningful regulation in one country will be dodged by moving to a different country.

&gt; We certainly have, I mean we're going a step further, I believe we'll be forcing our banks to ring-fence their retail operations from their investment operations so as to prevent contamination between the two, that sounds like fairly pro-active bank regulation to me and I haven't heard of any other EU nation doing something similar yet.

The problem is that this regulation still has tons of loopholes. But this also highlights why this specific regulation, only enacted in one country, means jack. Because if an investment bank in Britain goes under, they might still have a big debtor in another European country that is doing retail. Also what would stop said UK bank from letting their investment wing lend from a French bank that holds a lot of money from the retail wing of the same UK bank. If the investment bank goes bust, so will the French bank and then the other wing.

Since all this could even happen internationally with banks all over the world, regulation needs to be international to work. That isn't possible in reality. But you might be able to regulate capital investment, lending and borrowing across borders. So you can limit this problem beyond Europe. But you can't limit such thing within a common market. If mentioned UK regulation would really hurt any UK financial institution, there is absolutely nothing stopping them opening up a letterbox company in any other European country. After all, we have a common market.

&gt; So if Mr Sarkozy was was so passionate about de-leveraging and regulation he could have ordered that the French banks do the same as ours? But he did not and now French banks seem to be the ones in trouble.

I already voiced my opinion about the little guy. French politics is disgustingly corrupt at times. And he is the king of corruption. And yes, when the curtain falls, the dumb banks fail. But if they would *really* let them fail (which ain't going to happen) which banks do you think are next? UK's? Germany's? That is where the [link comes in that I posted above](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/ln1fm/very_nice_euro_crisis_data_visualization_by_new/). 

&gt; I am not so sure how this is our fault?

I am not sure who ""our"" is, but when tougher Europe wide regulation was on the table, Gordon Brown was the financial industry's best man in blocking any attempt for tougher regulation. That's not to say that there would have been anything really tough on the table. After all, other countries have financial industries, too. And those also have vested interests in their respective governments. But nowhere is the influence of the financial industry so strong and visible than in the UK. 

I figure that is also where part of the London riots came from. Societies have rules that are enforced by the police to some extent. But mostly by an unwritten agreement that all abide by those rules. If many people seriously stopped abiding to the rules there is nothing the police could do about it. The financial elite in Lodon openly disobeyed those rules and not only got away with it reaping massive fortunes that the rest of society has to pay for by huge cutbacks, but are heralded as an example to strive to.

In five years, we plan to have Italy back in black, cut these costs in Spain and improve the Greece produvtivity to EU level in 10 etc. We are also planning to change the banking laws so that this will never happen again, next time they will fail, etc etc (million more things).


I haven't seen any of that. It seems like they are  doing some ad hoc method, killing small fires but not the underlying one. Where is the plan? Where is the ""coming together"". Where is the agreements of fiscal discipline? As you may know, Sweden had a big crise in the 90's and what helped a parlamentary agreement to fiscal discipline (has been kept since), ""cleaning up the finances"", cutting costs,long term plans how to improve things, and also, disclosure of how bad it was. 


I do not see a lot of that in the way the EZ are handling the crises. It might as well go into a  Eurozone hole. If you have respect for your taxpayers, you disclose plans, and where the money is going - Eurozone do not. Nor do I see a plan.

America is equally responsible for it if not more.

Then in Europe, we all know how Churchill was a political hawk. Russians raped like few million women as they moved to Germany and just look how allies bombed Dresden.

About the Qaddafi money: this [article in the Süddeutsche Zeitung](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/geld/aufstand-in-libyen-schweiz-friert-gaddafi-vermoegen-ein-1.1064655) from February 2011 reports that Switzerland froze all assets of the Qaddafi clan (490 million €) while the EU is still debating about doing so. The total Qaddafi wealth is estimated at 6.5 billion. To be fair, the article also says that Qaddafi used to have much more money in Switzerland.

Here is a link to a [taxation treaty](http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/switzerland/eu_switzerland/political_relations/saving_tax/index_de.htm) from 2004. Switzerland agreed to hold back 35% of all income (e.g. dividends) on assets in Swiss banks. The owner only gets the 35% of his income back if he proves that he has declared his assets correctly. If not, the money goes to a large part to the EU. That makes it not so attractive to hide money in Switzerland in comparisons to places like Singapore.
