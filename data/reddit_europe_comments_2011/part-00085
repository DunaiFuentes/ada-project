true,DrunkenJarJar,null,null,"Hi there. I live in Asturias, am a foreigner too, and I can tell you, it is breathtakingly beautiful. I live in the capital city, Oviedo, and to be honest, it's not really a city. Coming from London, you will be underwhelmed by the size. I'd say it's a real big town, with a modern city mentality. A smaller village however will be just that, a small village with a small village mentality. If you were to live near the Picos de Europa (from your picture), such as in a city like Ribadesella or Arriondas, well, they're 'tourist' cities. I say tourist loosely though because they're mostly Spanish tourists and it's nothing at all like the numbers you see in Madrid, Barcelona or Andalucía. 

You could blend in easier in those places (Gijón, Oviedo, Avilés (to an extent), Arriondas, Ribadesella and Llanes), however going to a smaller town would be difficult to find a job maybe (I say this for anyone regardless of race). Your English seems pretty good, I assume you speak it fluently? Lately there have been quite a lot of posts on [infojobs](http://www.infojobs.net) for English teachers, so that's also an option. Even if you don't speak it fluently, a little lie and saying that you've been in London should suffice to get an interview at least. 

Cost of living is cheap here, cheaper than the rest of Spain, and a shit load cheaper than London, that's for sure. There are Spanish courses available, without speaking the language it'd be very tough to find a job.

You may have romanticised it a little, but even Woody Allen has fallen in love with Asturias and has [a statue](http://www.unioviedo.es/YORSGET/Venue.htm) to prove it.

true,Coastal_Storm,null,null,"I don't live in Asturias myself, although I've been living there ""virtually"" for years, and I am not fluent in Spanish, although I'm knuckling down now because I'm moving there in a few months.

The Oriente - the eastern coastal part of Asturias is the most beautiful part in my humble opinion, especially Ribadesella (winter pop. 3,500 downtown, 6,500 in the township, July August population around 30,000) and Llanes (slightly larger).   The coastal fringe is very thin, and the mountains surge up out of the landscape just a couple kilometers behind the coast.  The villages father inland - like in your photo - have higher rates of poverty, and I think you might find them a bit bleak in the long term. 

The people in the area (the Oriente) are known for their openess and friendliness to strangers.  I don't think being dark skinned should be a problem, but since I'm a white skinned North American I can't speak from experience.  In the nineteenth century, many Asturians emigrated to South and Central America.  In Ribadesella, there is a huge mosaic in one of the town squares of the old sailing ship the town owned that brought emigrants back and forth.  Some made fortunes, and they or their children or grandchildren returned - often racially mixed and darker.  They were the wealthiest people in the Oriente at the beginning of the twentieth century, and the landscape is dotted with the beautiful villas (""palacios"") they built.  They funded the building of primary schools, supported old folks' homes etc.  So - in my outsider's view - there is something of a tradition of slightly darker skinned, arriving from abroad with a slightly different Spanish, being at the top of the social pyramid. I'm probably overstating it, but there is an element there that you don't find on other parts of Europe.

The local Asturian television network (rtpa.es) has a program called Objetivo Asturias that features interviews with three or four foreigners living in Asturias in each program.  you might be able to learn more about attitudes there.  There are eleven programs online in their archive (""tpa a la carta"").  There are a number of French living in Asturias (over 400 I think).  Far fewer other western Europeans, almost no North Americans.  In Ribadesella in 2001, I was only aware of three non-French Europeans living full time in the township.  Now I am aware of eight.  And soon nine when I move there myself in May 2012!  All are very well integrated into the community - one woman has founded a new successful choir in Ribadesella.  Another two are a gay couple living in a village of just 150, who have had no trouble with acceptance, and one of them just had a show at the local art center.  Another couple from Germany who just moved in last month, will be opening up a bed and breakfast on the Camino del Santiago.  But you do need to learn Spanish.  Your neighbors will be friendly and engaging even if you only speak a hundred words of Spanish, but that won't take you far enough.

The community is in the middle of an employment crisis, not as bad as the rest of Spain (it's 11% in Ribadesella I think, 14% in Llanes) but that is because many of the unemployed leave and look for work in larger cities.  I can't imagine you would be able to find a job, that a local wouldn't be better at.  But if you can find some way of self-employment?

From a detailed income statement you can learn what is their profit margin, cost of goods and expenses. Compare margins of similar businesses in different countries and you'll get an idea why prices are different.

For example, if profit margins are bigger in Europe then it's obvious that consumers pay more. There might be further reasons, like higher taxes (so in the end business owners would get less if they had equal profit margin), less competition (due to regulations, unavailability of capital etc.), consumer behaviour (they just fucking love to pay more) etc. You might ask economist to explain that (although business owner is probably qualified enough to talk about taxes and regulations).

But at this point you've already ruled out large number of theories, so it gives you a lot of information.

Separation of church and state doesn't mean ""forbid religious practices in public buildings"". It means ""do not endorse or forbid one faith over another"". 

&gt; it is only logical that he also shouldn't be allowed to pray in the hallway. Do you see other students praying to their god in the hallway in school?

What is logical about him being forbidden to pray? Is he hurting anyone? Is he keeping other students from studying? Or is it just that he is doing something different (as you seem to imply by bringing up that no one else is praying)? In the simplest terms possible: Whose rights is he infringing upon by praying in the hallway?

Also, how do you know christian students aren't praying to their god? Prayer/ worship can take many different forms, should we also forbid bowing your head or folding your hands in school?

&gt; How is it right wing to not wanting prayer in school? Even in a radically religion obsessed country like the US they successfully separated this as it should be.

I have spent a year in the US, and I've spent that year in a religious area. I was enrolled in a public high school, and I had friends that prayed in school - before tests or sports matches, for example. No one stopped them from doing so, because it was well within their rights. Again: If the state (i.e. a teacher) had endorsed their (christian) prayer, for example by getting other students to join or by leading the prayer, separation of church and state would have been violated. Students privately praying in school has nothing to do with that.

Note that I'm not arguing for a muslim prayer room in public schools, because that would quite obviously mean that the state is endorsing islam. However, I do argue against forbidding prayer (of any form or denomination) in school.",0,1324026044,null,0,false,0,c38k154,t3_ncbns,t1_c38k154,t1_c389g66,1428030297,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

true,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; The British banks have had, however, a large hand in the dealing of junk financial products, which after devaluations led to the crisis. This is the part that has been gambled away.

Yes and no. Yes junk products (sort of) led to the financial crisis, and No because it has nothing to do with the Euro crisis. That has happened because of unwise governmental spending and mass-tax-dodging. It would have happened without the financial crisis.  

Using one as an excuse to impose a punitive tax to pay for the other is to conflate two separate issues. 

&gt; Another point is that the FTT can not lead to mass movements to both Frankfurt and New York. Frankfurt still has more regulations than the City, and there is no reason to move to a slightly more disadvantaged place of business.

I fail to follow the logic in this. You claim that there would be no movement through the EU, but if regulations are the same everywhere, then that clearly isn't true. In addition, if a bank can make more money being based in New York or Singapore than it can in London, then why wouldn't it move?

&gt; If all the countries did as this article suggest, they would all suffer a little bit for the greater good. Why except Britain?

You assume the suffering would be equally distributed. It won't be, and those that propose it know that. Those proposing the tax know very well that it would mostly hit London. 

Essentially, the FTT is using the 2008 financial crisis as an excuse to get London to pay for the Euro crisis, a crisis not of its making. In addition, it's an attempt to grab business from one city, and move it to other cities within the regions governed by those proposing the tax, thus further helping them deal with the Euro crisis.

And this kind of thinking is the problem. 

Everyone, especially on the continent, wants the banks ""regulated"", although they never specify what form the regulation will take. Why? Think about it for a minute. Why, *exactly* do you want the banks ""regulated""? 

Well, the Good ones among you want the banks regulated because you think it will prevent a financial crisis in the future. It won't. But I'll come to that in a minute. The Bad ones among you want the banks regulated because you think the banks, and any nation that derives business from them, should be punished for the 2008 financial crisis, because it led to the Euro crisis, and all the pain that's followed. Trouble is, that isn't true either. The Euro crisis would have happened anyway with the all dodgy accounting and tax dodging that's has been going on in places like Greece. 

On to regulation - no amount of regulation in the world will lead to a world in which there are no financial crises. It does not matter how much regulation you slap on the banks, it will still happen again eventually because people will *always* think their way around regulation if they have incentive enough to do so. 

What really caused the 2008 financial crisis was the bonus culture in financial institutions, and every financial institution, no matter where they are in the world, is guilty of that. In 2007 - if Mr Smith buys $10 million worth in junk bonds and sells them on an hour later for $12 million, then he has made his company $2 million, a healthy chunk of which will appear in his bonus cheque at the end of the year. But you and I know that that set of bonds probably isn't even worth £10 million. By the time it matures it might not even be worth half of that. You see the problem? The bonus culture encourages people to up-sell financial derivatives, regardless of their eventual value. If the derivatives are complex enough and mature at a far enough date in the future, then there is no way to check their value. No amount of regulation is going to kill off that culture, which is what needs to be done. 

Instead of talk of more regulation - a bad patch to a system already broken - we need to talk about how we change the bonus culture, so that what people get paid as a bonus is tied into the maturation date of the thing that they are selling. This will lead to a system in which payments get deferred, which in turn will incentivise people to figure out *exactly how much* that thing they are trading is likely to be worth down the line. A culture based on honesty because honesty pays off.  ",0,1324039604,null,0,true,0,c38ks4w,t3_nf22m,t1_c38ks4w,t1_c38koj7,1428030644,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Please don't base your view of this situation of the Telegraph alone, they aren't completely factual to say the least. And even so, what perks other than gloating will the outcome of this debate offer?

That said, it's my firm belief that both parties have absolutely no use for the other to perish or succumb to their debts and should better work together towards a solution in which all parties involved can benefit. They depend on each other much more than people seem to realize, a major downturn for either party will also be felt by the other.

As far as I'm concerned, we're all losers now, and this 'debate' centers around finishing last or second to last. Is that a battle worth fighting? How about we start to look at options together so we both can move up in the ranking? 

Pissing matches are fine and dandy on the school playground as is all this ""I'm-right-you're-wrong"" thinking that seemed to have crept into /r/europe. In my opinion it has no place and no useful consequences in international politics, the UK will be around for a long time, as will Europe, so for once lay off the national breast-thumping and start looking at the bigger picture.

Europe will have to reinvent itself as the speed and outcome of the political process seems to be magnitudes smaller than the tumultuous effects the rating bureaus are able to introduce on a day-to-day basis with a simple threat about downgrading a country. To use a dreaded car analogy: the debt-brake rule can be likened to a car that while skidding off the road plays an advertisement over the radio which announces that the next version of this car will come with better brakes. Nice, sure, but it won't stop this one from possibly crashing. In short: the brake is nice and all, but we need measures that have effect *now*. I think the window for *good* solutions has long since  passed and that the parties involved are left fighting over the *least bad* solution. Which at the moment seems to be introducing austerity to dampen the fall in affected countries, followed by measures to prepare an intervention of the ECB without damaging the AAA rated countries too much. I'm still afraid the AAA rated countries will end up paying for a large chunk of all this mess. Either that, or they'll have to take aim at rating agencies and inspect the ways they go about their business, as I too have a hard time believing those agencies are doing this for the common good, something along the lines of: *there are people losing a lot in all this, so there must also be people profiting from all this*.",0,1324040155,null,0,false,0,c38ktav,t3_nf22m,t1_c38ktav,t3_nf22m,1428030667,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Because they managed to set up a new record in destroying wealth?

&gt; Trouble is, that isn't true either. The Euro crisis would have happened eventually with the all dodgy accounting and tax dodging that's has been going on in places like Greece. 

While problems with the Greek were certainly inevitable, the quesion is whether the market reaction would have been as severe as it is now without the financial crisis? No. Because the crisis showed that risk was taken too willingly and rated too low. It raised the general doubt on debts. Also note how Greek bonds was supposed to be as safe as German bonds before the crisis -- sharing a cause with the crisis: disastrous judgment on part of the rating agencies.

&gt; On to regulation - no amount of regulation in the world will lead to a world in which there are no financial crises. It does not matter how much regulation you slap on the banks, it will still happen again eventually because people will always think their way around regulation if they have incentive enough to do so. 

Again you're going for extremes. Of course there is no way to completely eradicate bubbles from our economic cycles. That doesn't mean that we can't try to lower the risk and hold those accountable that caused them. 

The main cause of the crisis was not so much overreach/avoidance of the financial sector as much as deregulation of banks in the unlimited belief in the rationality of economic actors. Economic liberals set this one up.

&gt; No amount of regulation is going to kill off that culture, which is what needs to be done. 

We as the peoples are the sovereign powers. This is what needs to be demonstrated. We did not bow down to feudalism and we must not bow down to the power of the wealthy.

Yes, the wealthy are people, too, but we as democratic collective must not allow to be ruled by this minority. We can't keep falling to their lies of trickle down, supply-side economies and infallibility of the markets.

No wealth was destroyed. Money was transferred from one bunch of people to another bunch of people. The fact that you think it was destroyed is another indicator that you're not really thinking about what happened. 

&gt; While problems with the Greek were certainly inevitable, the quesion is whether the market reaction would have been as severe as it is now without the financial crisis?

Of course it would. 

You could argue that it's better that it happened sooner rather than later, given that the Greeks would have had no incentive to stop accruing debt otherwise. In other words - the problem only gets worse with time. Financial booms always end eventually, if this one had ended 10 years further down the line, Greece would be in far more trouble than it is now. 

The real fault, is with those who let Greece into the Euro, knowing full well what they must have known. 

&gt; Again you're going for extremes. Of course there is no way to completely eradicate bubbles from our economic cycles. That doesn't mean that we can't try to lower the risk and hold those accountable that caused them. 

In my opinion, that's not a sensible way of looking at things, because firstly you have to find everyone who is ""accountable"". It doesn't work like that. No one person, or persons, or institution is accountable - *it was the practice that was accountable*. 

&gt; The main cause of the crisis was not so much overreach/avoidance of the financial sector as much as deregulation of banks in the unlimited belief in the rationality of economic actors. Economic liberals set this one up.

This conflicts with what you said elsewhere about it being impossible to avoid busts in our economic cycle. How can it be the fault of economic liberals if such boom/bust cycles are inevitable?

Yes, the wealthy are people, too, but we as democratic collective must not allow to be ruled by this minority.

true,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; of course.. the few hundred bucks I got out of it make me as guilty as someone who earned billions out of it. The distribution of money is not nearly equal. The top 1% in the world own 40% of everything.

I'm not talking about guilt or wealth distribution. You made a statement referring to a mysterious ""guilty few"", and I was pointing out what I saw as the inaccuracy in your view. My point is, that very many people benefited a little from the conditions that led to the crisis, and a few people benefited greatly. Ironically, I don't think any of those who benefited greatly were the 1% you talk about elsewhere (again, I refer you to The Big Short as an example). So your allocation of blame for the financial crisis has become confused with your views on the unfairness of wealth distribution. 

&gt; Greece makes up for around 5% of the EU economy. I care more about the 95%, yes.

A lot of which is Germany. Yeah, I got that. 

&gt; The crisis has proven them wrong in large parts. Everyone with a brain could see it, yet they kept talking about debt not mattering, how you can just handle your credit card bills by taking a second mortgage. A system of everlasting growth, ignoring all the economic and ecological losses the society pays for in the end.

You're pushing your own political views into it again. I agree that the Ecological losses associated with most industries are never taken into account, as they should be. For example, we have effectively strip-mined Europes seas of fish (thanks in part to EU policy). But.. none of that has anything to do with applying regulation to banks.

You will surely agree that there are better and worst governments, calling someone narrow minded just because is stating the fact that one particular government had the worst performance in a given scenario is a sign that I can only interpret as political ignorance or a certain inclination for anarchism that I certainly do not share. It's our duty as citizens to evaluate a government performance, learn from its mistakes, remember those mistakes and vote accordingly. Gladly, in Portugal we can still choose our representatives from many different parties, maybe the US still has something to learn from a small country like Portugal.

FYI our economic decline started right after the Carnation Revolution.

true,AgentOfMisdirection,UKGB,United Kingdom,"EEA members do get a say through the EEA Council and they have quite a lot of wiggle room in how legislation is interpreted.  They ultimately do have a veto if it should ever come to that, but it never has.  The laws that are passed are exactly as I described them, bureaucratic misdemeanors, the sort of decisions if I were Lord of a manor I'd defer to my butler to make, and consider not worth my time.

Contributed to that no one state has a lot of say either way and is swamped out by quid pro quo voting.  If you look at the UK's EU vote now the three main domestic parties are split 4 ways, with UKIP being the second most popular party, and into 3 blocs, so the idea that the UK has any meaningful representation in the EU as it is, despite being one of the largest contributers and least net recipients per capita, is entirely specious.  72 MEPs split 4 ways in a sea of 736 MEPs.  

Added to that, if you're going to argue EU law as being a force for good, despite the UK already batting well above the EU average in many regards as it is, then if it works across 26 countries it will work in a 27th.  This isn't a xenophobic rant - I think you're all brilliant and I think you'll make great regulations.  When it comes to standardisation of orange juice containers I think you'll play a blinder and all the UK orange juice container manufacturers will just have to make EU orange juice containers if they want to sell to the EU common market.

Britain is the only country which can be relied on to actually enact agreed laws anyway, and to do what they say they'll do.  Even outside the EU the EU4 becomes the EU1.  Remember the Gleneagles G8 summit when Britain, France, Germany and Italy all agreed 0.56% of GDP by 2010, and 0.7% by 2015, would go towards aid, and how there's been a distinct lack of aid from France, Germany and Italy with only the UK being on target?  Yeah, the UK will take the same approach everybody else takes - they just choose on whimsy exactly how much or how little any regulation is enforced and interpreted.  

But I particularly like this argument whenever it rears its disfigured head.  Countries in the EEA get far more autonomy than those in the EU.  EU states do have to accept whatever is passed, as it is passed.  Even if you're dead set against it, you can bet somebody is behind it if the Commission's written it and a voting bloc that is utterly indifferent will vote for it on the understanding that another bloc will support them when the shoe's on the opposite foot.  The idea that being a part of the EEA but not the EU means giving away net power is barren, especially when it means they can now control their own duty, trade negotiations, fishing and agriculture policy  - all of which would otherwise come under the European Commissioners' claws, none of which are put into their seats of power by public election.  The argument staying in the EU gives you more say is like cutting your toenails with a shotgun.  Technically it works, you do get an irrelevant say, but you lose say in so much more.

But please join our German friend in asking Danish politicians to tell the UK they'd support them being part of the EEA if it wants a referendum to leave the EU if you think it would be a poor deal for the UK and a good deal for the EU.

true,boq,BAVA,near Germany,"Apparently Cameron asked to move back certain types of regulations into the domain of unanimity. At the moment they are subject to qualified majority voting. He was turned down. That's how I understood it [from the Economist](http://www.economist.com/blogs/bagehot/2011/12/britain-and-eu-1):

&gt;What they asked for was a protocol imposing decision-making by unanimity on a number of areas of regulation currently decided by majority voting. (If you want to be really technical, the choice is voting by unanimity or the special Qualified Majority Voting (QMV) used in the EU, which is a sort of super-majority system taking into account a certain number of countries and also their populations).
&gt;
&gt;As my source puts it, this amounted to a big winding-back of the clock for many EU leaders, setting a ""horrendous precedent"" that could unravel the single market. As they see it, common rules for the common market have been adopted (with few exceptions, such as tax) by QMV ever since the Single European Act approved by Margaret Thatcher in 1986.

crsp now claims French farmers, Spanish fishermen, German car manufacturers have some kind of protection and wants that protection extended to Britain's financial industry. I'd like to know through what clauses in the treaties or its protocols there is any kind of unanimity-based protection for said French, Spanish or German industries.

Your linked pdf continues as following:

&gt;it suggests that France (or at least Mr. Chirac) believed that France should not be outvoted on matters of supreme importance. The European Council would have been the better institutional setting for Chirac, since unanimity is the decision-making rule and there were better opportunities for issue linkage. A French attempt to veto a qualified majority vote in the CoAM would, politically, be much more controversial than lack of unanimity in the European Council.

It appears like this was just empty rhetoric by Chirac. As you can see [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_the_Council_of_the_European_Union#Unanimity), agriculture is not subject to unanimity. Neither are fish or cars. So again, where is that ominous protection that crsp demands for certain British industries coming from?

So far it appears to me that Cameron's demands in that respect can not be justified by certain 'protections' for any other European industry. Am I wrong?",0,1324060641,null,0,false,0,c38ngaj,t3_nf2u8,t1_c38ngaj,t1_c38m4e0,1428031902,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

If Italy and Greece go under then those French banks will. If France bails them out it will be an utterly insane amount of damage to the French Governments books. If they let them collapse then the French economy will be fucked. 

That's the source of the problem, not sovereign deficit. If the French politicians don't understand that then they're blinded by their own distrust of capitalism and should be removed for being delusional. If they do realise this, which I hope to God they do, then they're just playing politics, not criticising the agencies. 

They need to solve the debt problem not complain and attack people about it. Austerity and deficit reduction is completely beside the point in the short to medium term.

Omniscient business owners?

&gt;From a detailed income statement you can learn what is their profit margin, cost of goods and expenses. Compare margins of similar businesses in different countries and you'll get an idea why prices are different.

No, you'll simply get the impression *that* they're different.  An income statement, due to the very nature of its purpose, is purely quantitative.  There are no forensic questions posed, discussed, or answered.

&gt;For example, if profit margins are bigger in Europe then it's obvious that consumers pay more.

You're wrong again.  While a higher profit margin *might* mean that consumers pay more for a specific good, it could be equally true that they don't.   

&gt;Yes, economists might know these things too, but usually economic theories are over-simplified, they just consider few factors and ignore the rest.

If you would have stuck simply at simplified (instead of over-simplified), I would have agreed with you.

On that score the UK's most popular party is part of the AECR bloc, fourth largest, with 50 MEPs.  The UK's second most popular party when it comes to European elections is UKIP.  They don't have a voting bloc.  The UK's third most popular party is Labour and it is part of the second largest bloc in the EU.  The UK's fourth most popular party in the European elections was the Liberal Democrats, they're represented by the third largest voting bloc in the EU.  

See where this is going?

British representation in the EU does not flow with the mainstream.  The most popular parties, with the most popular support, are largely isolated, with the less popular UK parties currying more support in Europe.  British consensus is the inverse of that in Europe.

Fact is, whether it's good news or bad news, whether it is morally right or wrong, popular British opinion doesn't carry much weight in the EU.  The two most popular British opinions have the fourth largest voting bloc and no voting bloc.  

That spells irrelevant.

&gt; An income statement, due to the very nature of its purpose, is purely quantitative.

I had few economics-related courses in university, mostly math-related stuff. I can't say I remember everything, but I have a general idea.

By the way, prices are mostly a subject of microeconomics, not macroeconomics, from wikipedia:

&gt; Microeconomics examines how these decisions and behaviours affect the supply and demand for goods and services, which determines prices, and how prices, in turn, determine the quantity supplied and quantity demanded of goods and services.

Fidesz is trying to finance their failed economic model and badly timed tax cuts with one-off ""unorthodox"" measures like

- ""Crisis taxes"" on banks and telecom companies (most of these taxes are against the law and EU regulations and will have to be paid back someday)
- Forcing banks to allow people to repay their CHF-based loans massively below the current exchange rate (180 instead of 250). The effects of this law alone could cause the Austrian credit rating to be downgraded.
- Seizing the assets of all **private** pension funds (basically sacrificing the country's life savings to finance one year of their unrealistic economic dreamworld)
- And now they are also trying to get access to the reserves of the national bank to finance one more year. This is the last reserve of the country. After this, there will be absolutely fuckall nothing.

So the net result is complete unpredictability and a lack of direction. This scares investors away, which means

- higher bond yields, making it more costly to finance the country from the market
- no one in their right mind will want to make business here, because they don't know when and how their profits are going to be seized
- the country is starting to run out of its last reserves

So paradoxically this means that the more independent they are trying to be from the IMF, the more dependent they are becoming from the IMF - because without the support of the IMF behind us, no one is going to lend us money and buy our government bonds. If we can't get this IMF deal within the next 2 or 3 months, we are utterly fucked.

For instance, when a Tobin tax was introduced to Sweden [1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobin_tax#Sweden.27s_experience_in_implementing_Tobin_taxes_in_the_form_of_general_financial_transaction_taxes):

&gt; Even though the tax on fixed-income securities was much lower than that on equities, the impact on market trading was much more dramatic. During the first week of the tax, the volume of bond trading fell by 85%, even though the tax rate on five-year bonds was only 0.003%. The volume of futures trading fell by 98% and the options trading market disappeared. On 15 April 1990, the tax on fixed-income securities was abolished. In January 1991 the rates on the remaining taxes were cut in half and by the end of the year they were abolished completely. Once the taxes were eliminated, trading volumes returned and grew substantially in the 1990s.

Regulatory changes apply over the whole Eurozone, but Britain has much more to lose than other countries. There is also significant anger in European countries about the role of British banks in the crisis.

What you're seeing must be the fixed rates by which those currencies were exchanged for the euro. Conversion to the abolished currencies actually used to be quite common in the early days after the introduction of the euro cash -- people still ""thought"" in the old currency terms they were used to, much like somebody on a vacation would convert local prices to know what the price was in terms she was familiar with. Over time, people got used to the new magnitudes and the practice ceased, but it's a cheap gimmick and there is no reason to take it out of existing conversion tables.

\* There are exceptions, sometimes countries try to ensure a stable currency by artificially fixing them to that of another currency of a larger economy, like the US dollar or the euro.

From the point of view of Britain, there is no difference on what the answer to this question is, the only important thing should be how to work an common agreement with the ECB that would satisfy the both. For example maybe UK could give jurisdiction over the said entities and their employes to an Eurozone authority? Or could the clearing houses incorporate to Eurozone, but keep their location in London? Or could there be some legislation and regulation that Britain could enact that would allow hightened security to achieved?

true,rpad,null,null,"First of all its another false title. There was no attempt to ""curb powers"", there was tho an attempt to curb his pay. Since he is earning even more than the chief of the US FED. There was a law due to austerity to limit the pay of workers in the state sector (and there were other measures too). What the chief of central bank did, was to reduce the pay of those working at the central bank, but not of the leadership. If you are politically motivated, you can consider an attempt to limit his pay to be an attempt to ""limit his powers"". 

When you just read the summaries: ""created media regulator"", ""curbed jurisdiction"" those are true to a degree. But most of the people don't know what is behind those steps, why those steps were made, and what those steps really were. For example the media regulator existed even before the current government, but it was two separate organizations, one for the media content, the other for the carriers (radio frequency regulation, etc), and they were spending tax money separately. The current government chose to reduce the overall state bureaucracy. From the two media-related state organizations they made one, reduced spending (and made a number of bureaucrats redundant). The same was done in the field of state-media, the state news agency was merged with the state TV and radio. All these moves the opposition considers as ""concentration of power"", and presents as some kind of ""antidemocratic process"" to the world.

A similar proposal for merging has been submitted regarding the central bank. There is the central bank, and there is an organization for oversight of the financial institutions. The proposition was to merge these two institutions into one. Not right now, but the proposal was to initiate the process. I presume the government would have waited until the current central bank chief's mandate expired, and they would have then merged the two organizations. There is a new central bank law in preparation, which was submitted to the EU for review, and the law is being modified based on the received review. 

All these are state reforms. Much of the current state organization of Hungary goes back to communist times. A lot of state organizations are redundant. Did you know that if you wanted to build a house in Hungary, there is potentially 40 state organizations you may have to get into contact to get a permit? There is a big overhaul of the local government jurisdictions, and new offices are opened, where you can manage all your matters in one place. That too is a concentration of power. Or a more ""authoritarian"" state. Or streamlining of the state bureaucracy. Depends on the viewpoint. It is also true that all these reforms are hurting certain peoples interests.

All we can really do is guess. 

Cameron vetoed for one of three reasons I think.

1) He wanted to veto. It didn't matter what, but he wanted the popularity bounce. I'm cynical but not that cynical.

2) He felt if he didn't veto then he'd have to do a referendum. I don't think that's the case.

A crisis that is the product of the European euro.  A crisis the euro makes impossible to solve.  A crisis the full flowering of which, lies ahead of us. 

The Lisbon Treaty plays a major part in the European delusion, the faux European good intentions that litter Europe's road to the hell of bankruptcy.

It purports to provide an Emperor's clothes legitimacy to a construct that eats itself by the tail, unable as it is to get its accounts signed off.

It acts as a foundation of sand, postponing the collapse of a top heavy structure that gyrates between Brussels and Strasbourg for no other practical reason that to line the pockets of its functionary's and pander to the arrogance of its seigniors.       

A loose granular foundation that supports more and yet more levels of idiocy until, undermined by the the sovereign debt crisis the whole edifice comes crashing down.

The Lisbon Treaty made a solution to the crisis impossible because it enhanced and promoted the very pygmies, chimps and gnomes that inherited and enhanced the problem and created an administrative structure with insufficient financial accounting, regulation, understanding or even common sense to address that problem efficaciously.

The Lisbon Treaty was Valery's contribution to the European thing.   Valery wrapped it up in gorgeous silks and ribbons and passed it on to the fools who accepted it, the harbinger of their own destruction, like a sacred flame, the way fools usually do.

This is all completely unnecessary, and frankly little more than an invitation to slap our dicks down on the table and compare Daily Mail talking points. I wouldn't dream of making such sweeping generalizations about France or Germany. In fact, you even have a [borderline xenophobic remark](http://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/n7ge0/4chan_on_eus_expansion_to_eastern_europe/c36x8ym) about Britain on your first page of comments. Perhaps someone who frequents 4chan boards shouldn't complain about tabloid culture.

Now, it is true that Britain has a problem with its tabloids and borderline xenophobia, but it is very complicated to untangle it all, and it's useless to approach it in a glib way. Broadly speaking, the problem is that it is the result of a number of positive virtues. 

There is a long traditional of comedians who lampoon xenophobia by posing as xenophobes, John Cleese as Basil Fawlty being the obvious example. That sort of comedy can be misinterpreted, both by its domestic audience, who make those sort of jokes sincerely, or by a foreign audience, who interpret the jokes as sincere. Someone like Jeremy Clarkson is a sort of second-hand misinterpretation of that tradition. 

Also, the euroscepticism, sometimes sliding into xenophobia, often comes from an image of a traditional Britain, perhaps best described by the poet John Betjeman. To give a bastardized version, we're talking cricket on the village green, yew trees in the churchyards, vicar in the rectory sort of thing. That can be quite reactionary, but it can also represent some of the best things about Britain, for instance that tumble-down, bumble along attitude to life, or the humanism and slight absurdity of the Anglican church. Alan Bennett is in a similar tradition.

So it's difficult to stamp out those attitudes without stamping out good and positive things, which are at the heart of British culture. In terms of the relationship with Europe, in some ways it's a two way process, to smooth over the relationship it would be good if the EU was rather more responsive and functional (e.g. how long it took to sort out [throw-back with the CFP](http://www.fishfight.net/the-campaign/)), and if Britain wasn't constantly isolated against a Franco-German alliance (it would have been positive if a deal had been done in the last weeks, you have to congratulate Angela Merkel for at least making the approach).

&gt;the Lisbon Treaty is an important part of the European construct and the European continuum and as such plays a major part in the full flowering of the European sovereign debt crisis.

It's mainly a consolidation (and improvement) over all the former treaties. Since the crisis is about the euro, if any critic should be made about a treaty, it should be about the Maastricht Treaty. The Lisbon Treaty added pretty much nothing in this area.

Same thing for all the other arguments (which do not come with any kind of proof...). It's the very idea of european integration that is attacked, not the Lisbon Treaty in itself which wasn't really a revolution. Thinking this way, why not say that the crisis was caused by the Treaty of Rome ?

&gt; Individuen können Preisveränderungen bzw. die Inflation aus verschiedenen Perspektiven betrachten. Brachinger unterscheidet zwei verschiedene Perspektiven, die von Konsumenten und die von Käufern. Für einen Konsumenten sind die Kosten bzw. der Preis des von ihm konsumierten Warenkorbs und der Güter sowie die Kostenveränderung oder Teuerung des Warenkorbes von Interesse. **Ein Gut ist dabei umso wichtiger, je höher der Kostenanteil des Gutes an den Gesamtkosten des Warenkorbes ist. Diese Perspektive dient allgemein als Grundlage von Konsumentenpreisindizes.**

vs.

&gt; **Aus der Sicht eines Käufers sind aber die Kaufakte der Güter und deren Preisveränderungen von Bedeutung, weshalb die Kaufhäufigkeit und nicht der Kostenanteil der Güter am Warenkorb eine zentrale Rolle spielt.**

&gt; Um die Perspektive des Käufers darzustellen, erstellt Brachinger seine Theorie der wahrgenommenen Inflation. Ziel dieser Theorie ist es, basierend auf dem Entscheidungsverhalten von Käufern die Wahrnehmung von Preisveränderungen abzubilden. Daher beruht diese Theorie auf grundlegenden Erkenntnissen der Psychologie, im Wesentlichen auf der „Prospect Theory“ und der Verfügbarkeitsheuristik von Kahneman und Tversky.

Der Konsument ist rational und schaut einfach wie viel Geld er für was ausgibt, und gewichtet damit. Der Käufer ist es nicht und gewichtet nach subjektiven Größen:

* wie oft kauft er das Gut (unabhängig davon wie viel er dafür insgesamt ausgibt) -- also Essen kauft er vielleich 52 mal im Jahr, und darum gewichtet er das mehr als seine Telefonrechnung, die er nur 12 Mal im Jahr begleicht.
* entwickelt sich der Preis nach oben oder nach unten (negativ wahrgenommene Steigerungen wirken schwerer als positiv wahrgenommenen Senkungen)

Der Konsument macht beides nicht. Ihn interessieren relative Anteile, nicht Kaufhäufigkeiten und er wertet steigende und sinkende Preise als gleich wichtig.

true,almodozo,null,null,"&gt;First of all its another false title. There was no attempt to ""curb powers"", there was tho an attempt to curb his pay. [..] If you are politically motivated, you can consider an attempt to limit his pay to be an attempt to ""limit his powers"".

This is incorrect. As the article explains right at the top already, the controversial issue here isn't about cutting his pay, but about limiting his authorities. The government, obviously, wants to emphasize the bit about cutting his pay, since that's a popular move, but that's not where the beef of the controversy is, and the article mentions several very specific examples of how his say about central bank policies will be limited:

&gt;The law would expand the rate-setting Monetary Council to [..] nine members from seven, according to the draft posted on Parliament’s website today. The central bank chief will have to cede powers, including naming vice presidents, that would belong to the prime minister and the country’s president. [..]
&gt;
&gt;The central bank bill would allow the number of central bank vice presidents to be expanded to as many as three from two. The Monetary Council would decide on their responsibilities at the central bank chief’s recommendation.
&gt;
&gt;Simor was this year stripped of his right to nominate two of the four outside members in the Monetary Council. 

This is not a secret: the government itself explicitly argues that they're limiting his powers, and that this is a good thing:

&gt;The central bank bill “represents a shift in emphasis in the sense that the decision and execution powers concentrated in the hands of the central bank president will now be divided between the Monetary Council and a newly created board,” the ministry said in the document.

true,almodozo,null,null,"Similarly, what you write about the new media authority glosses right over the most controversial elements of the new media laws:

&gt; For example the media regulator existed even before the current government, but it was two separate organizations, one for the media content, the other for the carriers (radio frequency regulation, etc), and they were spending tax money separately. The current government chose to reduce the overall state bureaucracy. From the two media-related state organizations they made one, reduced spending (and made a number of bureaucrats redundant). 

The most controversial parts of the new media authority are not that it is one central body rather than two separate ones, though that is obviously part of the equation. What makes this centralisation so problematic is that this new body also has far more powers than the two previous bodies combined had in the past. The media laws imposed content regulations that go further than the previous laws, which the new central body will be able to impose. A whole bunch of regulations will apply to all media - not just broadcasting, as is traditional across Europe, but a wide array of online media as well as all print media. The fines are higher than before, extensive registration and data disclosure provisions were put in place. 

Perhaps most problematically of all, this new centralized body is governed by a President with unprecedented concentration of powers, who is a former governing party politico, and a Media Council, whose members were all exclusively nominated by the governing party.

&gt;The same was done in the field of state-media, the state news agency was merged with the state TV and radio.

Similarly, the way you describe the reform of public TV skips over the most controversial elements. The state news agency wasn't just merged with the public broadcasting system. (It's probably telling that you use the word ""state media"", as that is exactly what the government is turning it into.) No: the state news agency received the *exclusive* right to produce news items for all public broadcasters. All the news you now hear and see on public TV and radio comes straight from the state news agency. That's unprecedented in Europe.

As for what kind of news this state news agency produces under the Fidesz government, I will let its new director, Csaba Belénessy, [speak for himself](http://www.168ora.hu/itthon/belenessy-csaba-a-koz-uj-szolgalatarol-66304.html): ""public service media,"" he said, ""'should be loyal to the government and fair to the opposition' and should not be an ‘enemy of the government’ or challenge the ‘power of the freely (democratically) elected cabinet"". After all, he said about his own work: ""It’s not right to accept a position and then defy the employer.’""

It goes on. The merger of all public media is one thing; another is that these public media have been hollowed out of most of their editorial and financial independence. They used to have their own, fixed budgets - a set percentage of the license fee revenues. But now all their assets have been taken over by a new Media Fund (MTVA). This Fund is now effectively the employer of 90% of public media employees; it controls all their assets; it buys and produces the programs they broadcast. The Fund is also in charge of an annual redivision of budgets for the indvidual stations. And who is in charge of this Fund? Annamaria Szalai, the ex-Fidesz politico who leads the newly centralized media authority, appoints, and can recall at any time, the President of the Fund, the Vice-Presidents of the Fund, and the chairman and all members of the supervisory board of the Fund.

No wonder that journalists are in hunger strike now: public media have, more than ever before, been turned into state media, which only broadcasts what the government likes.

The fines are still lower than in west Europe, but media revenues are comparable to western revenues. The registration was mandatory even before the new law. It had one new element in this regard, and it was the registration of the biggest Web news portals. And that was put into the law, its not a secret, on the suggestion of the owner of the biggest leftist news portal, Index.hu. The need for registration was suggested as a way to make the owners of the far-right portal Kuruc.info responsible for the content on their site. They can still hide behind anonymity while poisoning the political culture. And don't tall me that ordinary blogs were also a target, because that was specifically made clear that they are not, 2 months before the law was put on vote. Just look at it how the MSZP-SZDSZ tried to solve the problem with Kuruc.info, they used the secret service to try to close it down, with not much success. This is all typical of the socialist political culture. Use the secret service to control the media, but when another government tries to regulate with laws, trough proper legal regulation, then start to defend free speech, even if its hate speech. 

&gt;(It's probably telling that you use the word ""state media"", as that is exactly what the government is turning it into.)

Well tell me that the ""public"" media wasn't a state governed media in the time SZDSZ reigned over it? They kicked out everyone from the opposition and put their own people in all places. I'm not saying that they did the same as Fidesz does currently, they did much-much worse, but they did it informally, silently, trough ""friends"". The political elite tried to make a new media law for 15 years, but either there was not enough consensus, or the chaos was suitable for those who had informal control over media anyway. Whenever someone of your conviction speaks about censorship and state-friendly media, i just remember what ""Napkelte"" was during the MSZP-SZDSZ government, and i lough. It is both sad and laughable that liberals are taken seriously in matters of media freedom when they have sink the media to the level of the old communist propaganda. That is the best example that regulation is only worth what the media actually makes of it.

&gt;No wonder that journalists are in hunger strike now

Some journalists are on a hunger strike because of a specific issue, for which two managers were found responsible and were kicked out. Its the same shit as was done all before, manual influence over media. But that again shows, the law is as worth as it is adhered to. Look at it this way, if this had happened during in the SZDSZ-controlled media, those people would have not been kicked out.

Also, they translate family names. And even mistranslate them, as in Josep Pla written as José Placita (you said you read the link, didn't you? So you agree with this translation????)

You talk about fascist names. Josep Pla, during fascist times, was known as José Pla, not José Placita. And another example in the link you have read is Plaça Francesc Macià. He was the president of the Catalan Government on Republic times. Of course he had no street during the dictature. In fact, this square was called Plaza de Calvo Sotelo at that time.

I don't have a TomTom GPS, so I can not try it. They have been using Tele-Atlas for a long time, and the names were the real ones.

I am a pragmatic pro-European but I have very real concerns with the democratic deficit, the way certain programmes are run eg. CFA, CFP, the fucking ludicrous Brussels-Strasbourg bullshit etc etc. Anyone voicing concerns about these things is almost always yelled down as a Eurosceptic or in your view a xenophobe/racist.

true,Kim147,UKGB,United Kingdom Thanks,"One of the things that retail banks get to do is to create money in response to deposits made . This gives them liquidity . What is also allows them to do is to provide good interest rates in response to those deposits made . 

What the government can do is to stipulate that certain loan categories have an interest rate pegged to the base rate . IE. they can stipulate that housing loans have a low interest rate and that other loans have a higher rate . This allows the government to enable stimulation of certain sectors of the market . 

Providing that this system is kept within the retail banking sector - ie. this created money is not allowed into the investment banking sector - then this system works well . 

Once this 'funny money' is put into the investment banking sector - ie. in an attempt to monetise it - it creates an unstable economy due to it's inherent lack of real value . A big problem with the economic crisis has been large amounts of funny money circulating around the various markets , distorting these markets , being increased greatly in size and being skimmed off .

My interest on the matter isn't big enough to look for an old map and check. That's why I called it a ""hypothesis"". Thanks for your kindness, anyway.

&gt; And take a look to these links, please, neither google nor Tele-Atlas:

Trobajo del Cerecedo has 785 inhabitants. They might have a whorehouse, but I hardly think they'll have a hotel. 
Here's the [""Hotel""](http://i.imgur.com/DzHdP.png).  The WTF thing is that one of the street signs with the name appears blurred, but you can more or less read ""Calle Generalísimo Franco"" (under some black paint), and in the other there's a clear ""Calle Huertos"". 

And apparently, there's a [shop](http://www.mouta.com.ar/directorio/ver/empresa/drexel-equipment-uk-limited-sucursal-en-espana_58506) in ""Calle del Generalísimo, Sant Jaume d'Enveja"". Doesn't seem very likely, either. Sadly, the google car hasn't reach them yet, so I can't check. 

Anyway, both appear on Bing as ""Calle Generalísimo Franco"" (the one in León) and ""Carrer Generalísimo"" (the one in Tarragona). In this case, the data is supplied by NAVTEQ.

In America, there is virtually no opposition to the federal government in terms of people separating and creating a new nation. Europe is way richer historically and way more diverse, so there will always be opposition to the full integration of an European state. As such I don't think the creation of a sovereign federal European state is something that will or should happen overnight. And in all honesty I have no clue how we can quell down this opposition.

No

No.

Of course I did. Gyurcsany was a self-confessed liar who deliberately lied about everything in order to get elected, and was proud of it. The MSzP-SzDSz government was a den of corruption, and the police violence in 2006 was explicitly condemned and criticized by Amnesty International.

In [this link](http://ukinspain.fco.gov.uk/en/help-for-british-nationals/living-in-spain/births-deaths-marriages/marriage/foreign-marriage) from the UK embassy in Spain you have all the information you need about EU citizens (you, in this case) married to non-EU citizens (your Canadian husband), and applying for a working permit for him. It seems you'll need:

&gt; signed and sworn affidavits for each person, a legalised copy of the relevant marriage certificate, a translation of the marriage certificate (if not in Spanish), a certificate from the British Consulate, and all the above completed documents, united into one document by the Consulate, including the original marriage certificate and the consular certificate

Prior to doing all this you need to be already on hold on your own Spanish Residency Certificate. This is a straightforward process for EU citizens (as you should be by the time you do this). You just need to go to your nearest police station in Spain with your (UK) passport and fill a couple forms. You will be provided with a document assigning you a Spanish National ID number. Everyone here needs to have one as is required for virtually everything. [Here](http://www.grancanariaguru.com/gran_canaria_residencia) you can find info about the whole process (in English).

You do not need a marriage certificate issued by an EU country. The general rule is that the only valid marriage certificates are the ones issued by the country where the wedding took place. You can [deposit](http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/births-deaths-marriages-civil/marriage-and-civil-partnerships/depositing) your Canadian marriage certificate in the UK registry, but they won't issue a certificate for you. Your Canadian certificate will be perfectly valid in Spain. You will need to have it translated into Spanish by an official &amp; registered translator, recognised by the Foreign Office of Spain (""traductor jurado"" - official list [here](http://www.maec.es/es/MenuPpal/Ministerio/Tablondeanuncios/InterpretesJurados/Documents/2011sepIIJJ.pdf); there's even one living in Ottawa! - page 485), then you need to have both the original and the translation legalised (having them stamped by an official authority in Canada, according to La Hague convention / apostille). More info [here](http://international.gc.ca/about-a_propos/authentication-authentification_documents.aspx?lang=eng&amp;view=d).

Regarding the banks, according to the official list from the Central Bank of Spain, there is one Canadian bank operating here: [RBC](http://www.rbc.com/), but they only have 1 office in Madrid. I don't know if you can operate online with them and just withdraw money from the ATMs of any Spanish bank. There are contact details for their branch in Spain [here](http://www.canadaespana.org/directorio.php?idm=10).

ING Direct is present in Spain but the accounts are really hosted in The Netherlands. You can withdraw money for free in one of the [biggest ATM networks](http://www.4b.es/localizador-de-cajeros-4b) countrywide.

I don't think you will be able to stay (only) with your current bank. In Spain cheques are never used for paying employee wages. You will be asked for a Spanish Bank account number where the employer will transfer the money automatically at the beginning of each month. Most expats usually keep their own account in their country of origin and open a new account in a Spanish bank just for everyday operations. From time to time they might send some savings to their bank at home, but not every month since the overhead (commisions, etc) is huge. Almost 15% of people in the Canary Islands are foreign residents (mostly British and Germans) so you shouldn't have any problem finding banks that speak English (most of them do it).

Good luck and welcome to Spain!

**TL;DR** 1. Get an UK passport. 2. Get a Spanish residence permit for EU-citizens (you can get it at the Spanish embassy in Canada or once you (not your family) are already living in Spain). 3. Get a Spanish residence permit for your family (you need to have your own permit first to apply for your family) - you will need official translations (stamped by Canadian authorities according to La Hague Convention / Apostille) of documents that proof the relationship: marriage certificate for your spouse, birth certificates for your children of the non-EU citizens with you.

Now here you are, the constitutional court is showing that the constitutional control is working. Its not about (the sometimes rash) way the laws are made and changed, but how this is presented to the world. Just check the posts about surrounding countries (even on this site), do they link to articles describing their own controversial issues as some kind of fascist power-grab (or by some similar hateful way)? Do you really think they are more democratic than Hungary?

From what the Origo article says, the constitutional court objected to written/internet media being treated the same way as TV/radio. The need for registration of the biggest internet news sites would have not been a big change. The newspapers already have to register as businesses. The biggest news sites on the internet are either online versions of newspapers or all have known owners (Origo, Index), there is only one big internet news site whose owner hides behind anonymity. What is a law worth, when it does not cover the reality?

The other points were really about too much authority, mostly the result of constructs like ""in every *needed* way"", or were not specific enough. The article does not mention the ""too high fines"" or the much quoted ""fines for unbalanced reporting"" objections. There is also no objection about how the media authority delegates are elected by the parliament.

Edit: Cyprus wouldn't have to upgrade, it's more about pooling our individual resources into one.

Whenever I look at the British political system and how its set up, I think there's so much culture here, I'd hate to lose all of that. All the arguing and how intense it is. HOWEVER I don't think we need to lose it in order to federalize. All I'm advocating is to unify our policies. If you look at the states, Vermont has taken it upon itself to adopt universal healthcare. States still have huge power when it comes to their own well being, however things like foreign policy are dictated on a federal level. I think it's a case of keeping cultures but through cohesion funds helping to bring communities together. People often say that Britain isn't European because of the channel, yet Irish people certainly feel more European and they're further away!

And yes, I do worry that what happened to the US could happen to the EU if foreign policy was moved to a supranational level. I do think we are fundamentally different from the US though, and whereas I consider the US to have very bad representation (two political parties), our system is much more different with a wide variety of parties. Also the US allowed its military system to sort overtake priority of the government after world war 2, which is probably why we see the US giving 4% of its GDP to the military. What we need to do is keep military at a minimum (at the moment altogether we spend something like 1.6% of GDP, which I think is good!).

I don't actually (cross your fingers) need my unemployment insurance and have no problem being a net contributor.  

Thing is, I am not sure whether this would work with the Swiss - friends of mine who have been on the dole have been required to report in to job centers fairly regularly (a good thing IMHO) and apply for work or take positions they seemed qualified for.  So I don't know whether you could knock off to another country and continue receiving it.",0,1324315202,null,0,false,0,c39e416,t3_nienn,t1_c39e416,t1_c39dre2,1428044897,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yeah I know that's not how it should work.  But she was insured in France - much as I love the place, the administration there sucks shit.  She had her Carte Vitale, which took her 13 months to get (which is apparently a short time) and some sort of private insurance on top of that through her work.  She broke her leg in Switzerland while on a short skiing holiday, got an emergency doctor's inspection and x-rays, and a bill that she had to pay herself.  This cost her ca. 500 Euros.

The French health insurance refused to cover it unless she got a translation of the bill done by an officially recognized translator (each Mairie, or city hall, has a list of court-approved translators) which cost her 160 Euros for something she or I could have done better and for free (the bill was pretty clear in any language.)

Both the public (Carte Vitale) people and the private insurance then flat-out refused to reimburse her, saying the bill was not valid (it was from the public emergency room doctor in Switzerland).

I've heard similar things from a lot of people.  To be honest, I have _never_, whether in Europe or in the US, had a good experience with anything health-related, be it hospitals, insurances, or doctors.  I realize that I may be an atypical case, and am perfectly willing to accept that, but as I have only had negative encounters with healthcare systems, I start thinking they're all cheats and quacks.  I'm just glad I've never gotten seriously ill or had an injury, I dread to think what would happen.

My problem right now is that after living in France, I currently spend a lot of the time in Germany (although not enough to qualify for taxpayer status here), am registered in Switzerland, work for an Irish company for a client in the Netherlands.  Before you ask, it's not a tax dodge - I don't earn enough for that to even be worthwhile, and with taxes, social contributions, and insurance, it all comes out to about the same.  So you tell me.  I totally and completely lost the plot several years ago and gave up even trying to figure out all the administrative bullshit anymore.",0,1324315636,null,0,false,0,c39e6ec,t3_nienn,t1_c39e6ec,t1_c39dp1e,1428044925,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2
