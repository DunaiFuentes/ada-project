[Another diplomatic reaction from Iran](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/03/us-iran-britain-idUSTRE7B11D620111203)

My take on this. Iran is a devided country with some hard-line anti-western sentiment in high places. (Probably secretly being backed up by some western warmongers. *kough*) 

The anti-western sentiment is not surprising at all. We really cultivated that over Iran's nuclear program and our (the western) demand of a complete enrichment stop. While in the meantime we have no proof at all that they are weaponizing their nuclear technology.

They used to blame the US, but since Europe just sits there and does nothing, we are not getting anywhere. It's not weird or strange that this escalates. I really believe that the people who are anti-western are so because of our actions. 

We just don't look at ourselves, we rather blame them. (Which in turn opens the door for the warmongers...)

Yes, the net receipts wrt the EU budget for the UK is -57 billion Euro, but for the whole period 2007-2013. That should probably be understood, eh? It amounts to a net expenditure of 9.5 billion Euro per year. 

Now let's take a look at the UK domestic budget: The spending in 2011 is 711 billion GBP. That's 827 billion Euro. So the EU spending is 1.14 percent of the total UK spending per year. (NB: I'm simplifying, since I didn't check the budgets of the previous year. So I'm going to calculate the ratio as the average expenditure over the 2011 budget)

In summary: I'm not saying it's nothing, don't get me wrong. A percent of the total budget is a real thing, but on the other hand, don't blow it out of proportion. The base line is, IMO, if you don't like the way the EU works, you will dislike /any/ amount of money a country spends on it.

true,PointAndClick,NETH,The Netherlands,"The thing that struck me about Merkel position was that there was already agreements and a pact to keep the stability of the Euro. But Germany had several instances where it couldn't (or simply didn't) follow the agreements. Then Germany blocked the reprimands from the European commission. France did the same. And Merkel wants a new agreement... and she got Zarkozy on her side.

The option to buy sovereign debt is also not really my favourite, and I can understand the German veto on that. But now it seems it was simply a political choice to get Sarkozy in the same boat. Germany and France, they have absolutely no credibility when it comes to these kind of stability pacts.

I'm a bit pissed of about it. The Netherlands has always been given the example, sticking to agreements. And I feel like we are simply throwing our money and efforts against the wind. I remember our internal struggles about cuts and spending, while in the meantime it seemed France and Germany where just doing whatever. I wish I could say I felt good about 'doing the right thing', but I rather had we followed German and France examples.

true,Bhima,ASTR,Austria,"Winston Churchill said that “You can always count on Americans to do the right thing - after they've tried everything else.”.  This pretty much sums up my thinking of all of the European leadership.

The discussion that is just now being discussed should have begun when Lehman Brothers collapsed and it became clear that business as usual had to change.  

This idea that if the ECB engaged in any sort of Quantitative Easing ""then Hitler"" is appallingly disingenuous and the apparent alternative, QE by way of character assassination of other EU member states, counterproductive.  The global market is dominated by nations who are manipulating their currency: The Dollar, the Pound, the Swiss Franc, the Yuan, and the Yen... all are being manipulated to some degree.

At some point people, especially people in the status quo power structure, are going to have to acknowledge that some portions of the loans, bonds, and derivatives held by European Banks are just not worth what the Banks want everyone to think they are.  That the house of cards constructed of securities derived from synthetic debt obligation created wealth that is largely imaginary.  That if those in power go along with banks and push the burdens of these bad debts and recovery of imaginary profits on to the average citizens of the EU, instead of those actively participating in these financial machinations, it will change Europe for the worse for generations... it's the anti-Marshall plan... and at the rate our leaders are going, we'll all be dead before anything gets done.

I understand the tolerance thing, and I don't find that too controversial.
I also understand social security being culturally shared to those willing to do their part.

However, could you elaborate on the last two points? 

* Why do certain jobs make more sense for the Dutch, besides simply stereotyping? As far as I can tell, gender segregation in jobs isn't very ideological (that is, it is rarely is justifiable), but culturally ingrained due to stereotyping. Or were you just demonstrating a way in which Dutch women and men, while they have liberal political views, behave conservatively?

* The point on LGBT-rights is interesting to me. In Brazil there is currently legislation being passed that will outlaw any sort of discrimination against a LGBT person (for example, hiring practices), and  apparently will outlaw other homophobic hate crimes. The religious groups are saying this infringes on their right to consider homosexuality wrong (say, hiring someone who is LGBT to care for their children). Is the discussion something along these lines in the Netherlands?


Also, if you feel like elaborating further, I was wondering how the Dutch consider foreigners generally. I've heard that it is difficult for a foreigner to build good friendships with the Dutch. Is this a myth perpetuated by people unwilling to assimilate, or do you think there is cultural segregation due to the Dutch being closer to their own?

If they don't speak very good english, or your french is terrible then show them what you're taking so they can try to match it. People are extremely friendly in this town as long as you show them respect and that you're trying.

2) numbers, left, right, north, south, east, west, je parle un peu le francais, enchantee (when meeting someone), I do not know, know your meats &amp; organs too in french so you know what you're eating, use vous instead of tu in all cases unless you happen to meet friends there. Understand the differences between la/le/fille/femme/homme/garcon/madame/mademoiselle/etc.., ""how do you say..."", ""how much is..."", and ""where/what is...""

3) There's an iPhone/Android app for Radio France. There's a few sub stations (pop, rap, talk, classical, rock, folk, etc..) within it but I encourage downloading it. 

4a - Food) Try everything. Look at www.parisbymouth.com and for reservations at most places, www.thefork.com . The really good ones like Frenchie and Chateaubriand are not listed on there and are booked months in advance. If you want a good place that's new, will take care of you, speaks good English, and really knows their shit: book at Vivant and Spring. If you want classic rustic French food without all the elegance &amp; bs, then check out Chez Denise (over 100 years old), around the Les Halles/Rue Berger area. *You won't be disappointed*. Just a warning, they do get very busy so do not get offended if they seem pushy. Ask for Patrick if you go. He'll help with the menu if you need it. Wonderful guy. Reservations encouraged. Only go there on an empty stomach. They do not skimp on the portions. Agape Substance is also at the top of my list of recommendations. Chez Robert et Louise if you like beef (the boudin noir is wonderful though), but its hard to find - not clearly labeled. Worth the adventure though. When you go see the Eiffel Tower, stop at Cafe Constant for Lunch (or Dinner - reservation for this sitting).

Ice cream: Berthillon. You'll see this all over Paris. Many places carry their product, but Maison Berthillon is right in the middle of Ile St. Louis (where you want to go if you're going to have this). Simply put, its fucking proper ice cream, like poetry. 

4b - Drink) Wine. Its cheap, and they do it right. Absinthe. Its also cheap, and they do it right. I recommend Cantada II for this. If you're looking for an Absinthe botique, Vert d'Absinthe (near Bastille). There's no better place for it in Paris. Harry's New York Bar &amp; Experimental Cocktail Club if you happen to like a speakeasy. Hemmingway Bar if you want something over-the-top. The Frog &amp; Rosbif (or any of them), if you're looking for a low key expat place (they make their own beer). Le Prohibido is a good small neighborhood spot w/ friendly folks and good music. L'Hotel Bar &amp; Perscription are also worth mentioning. Beer - also cheap, but not much of a selection in most places unless you're heading to a Belgian restaurant. Its still a better selection then what you're used to in America though. 

5) Museum National d'histoire Naturelle, Cite des Sciences et Industrie, Les Frigos, Les Invalides (Napoleon's tomb), &amp; Musee du Quai Branly. Give La Defense a go at some point, and don't forget the catacombs.

Safety: keep your personal belongings in your front pockets and watch your bags on the metro &amp; around major tourist attractions. Brush up on the scams you'll encounter from gypsies at these places and also in Pigalle. A Google search will tell you all you need to know. 

Bonus: get yourself a doner kebab sometime. Addictive late night food :) use your fork to eat french fries

Don't order your steak well done. 

Bring some cash with you when you go out. If you really like a place and want to leave a tip, there's nowhere to put it on l'addition (the check). 

Get a prepaid SIM card there, not before hand because you'll pay an arm and a leg. Stay away from SFR for this. Go with Orange. There's botiques all over the city. 

Extra: stay away from most Chinese food spots. They're not the same as what you're used to in the US. Think Panda Express but not as appealing. 

Live, drink, eat, dance, and be merry. You're going to love your stay.

It is not considered rude to just not leave any tip at all at most places?

Und jetzt? Das BGE ist die größte Volksverdummungs-Kampagne der letzten Jahre. Nicht nur, das jegliche Fragen der Finanzierung völlig offen sind.

Das oft zitierte Modell von Götz Werner hat vollkommen unabsehbare Auswirkungen auf den, für uns, so wichtigen internationalen Handel [100% Mehrwertsteuer], macht dann richtig gerechnet auch nur ca. 750 Euro aus und geht von unbewiesenen Annahmen aus, wie das die Preise bei sinkenden Netto-Löhnen sinken und sich das Ganze bei Abschaffung des Verwaltungsapparats schon irgendwie finanzieren lassen würde - was nicht stimmt, da ja zum Beispiel nirgendwo geklärt ist, was mit Menschen ist, die mehr Geld benötigen oder, mit Nicht-Deutschen.

Nein, die einzigen Profiteure sind die Besserverdienenden und die Leute, die sowieso nicht arbeiten wollen. Ausbaden darf das der Mittelstand.  Ich behaupte ja garnicht das unser jetziges System perfekt ist. Da gibt es viel zu verbessern. Aber das BGE als Alternative? Nein.

Hotspots that seem ""free"" really aren't and require some sort of user/password through a web portal similar to what you're used to seeing in American hotels. My place has fibre, so I'm without that issue. You could always buy a data package from Orange though that allows WiFi in the city. Skype will still cost you $0.20 a minute back to the states, compared to Google Voice at $0.02. 

Just bring a few Zyrtec-D or Claritin to hold you off. The pharmacist will be able to find something similar, and its also much cheaper then what you'd pay in the US. All meds are a fraction of the cost, and you can get tylenol w/ codeine without a perscription if need be. Cortisone cream requires a perscription though (they believe its addictive). I messed up my knee somehow &amp; had to get some painkillers and anti inflammatories to help, which only cost me a few euro at most. If you need to go to the hospital for whatever reason, do NOT go to an American hospital. Go to a French one. Their health care is superb and your pocket book will thank you later, even if you don't have insurance. Its still insanely cheap compared to the US.

Its not rude not to tip at places... I'm just saying in the event you want to be nice and you're really blown away by something, like I was at Chez Denise - La Tour de Montlhery, then leave a tip.. I wound up going back to that place several times and they always remembered &amp; took care of me. The ""rum cake"" usually means an entire bottle of rum left at the table for your disposal. Its also an awesome place to try organs: kidneys &amp; mustard sauce, tripe in calvados (normandy apple based cognac), brains, and other goodies like scallops, beef steak w/ bone (marrow included), stewed veal w/ white beans, escargot, head cheese, etc..  

If you're not a coffee drinker, you will be in Paris. Get it done proper. None of the watered down American shit you get at Starbucks. 

Cheese is served at the end of the meal, not before. Trust your waiter.

If you rent an apartment through www.airbnb.com or www.homeaway.com (which I highly recommend instead of a hotel) many landlords have free US calling available in the unit on their land lines. 

Don't worry about the French music.  You'll still hear plenty of stuff in English as you go. Quite honestly, French hip hop is pretty good, imo. 

Metro passes bought in bulk are only good from Sunday to Sunday. If you buy 10 on Thursday then they're no good come the end of the weekend. I got stuck at La Defense once without knowing this tidbit. Many places are also closed on Sundays as well. Mondays are also a common day for restaraunts to be closed. Check ahead of time before you go, and the same goes for museums and other attractions (ie: Louvre is closed on Tuesdays)

true,Bhima,ASTR,Austria,"Most of my friends are in ""Core Europe"" and are wealthy.  So in my circle the basic consensus is that the OWS does not have any relevance to us and our lives in Europe.  Unfortunately this is demonstrable untrue.  Just here in Austria there has been a lot of coverage of corporations corrupting politicians (complete with exchanges of plastic bags stuffed with money in back alleys).  Furthermore the disparity of CEO pay, while not as extreme as in America, is on that trajectory and is apart from the pay raises the rest of us face.  And lastly there is evidence of malfeasance and incompetence of every description in Austrian banks. So it's clear that we very much face difficulties of similar nature as in America, UK, or Ireland.  The scale might be smaller but it still presents an unacceptable risk to our civil society. 

I haven't really been paying attention but I am not aware of any large scale occupy movements in Europe, the one in Austria is / was tiny.  There have been similar protests in Spain but I think the Indignados predate OWS.

Instead what I see is highly fractured protest when small groups twig that they are going to be bearing the brunt of this newly fashionable austerity from their governments... currently I think Italian unions are waking up to this.

I feel that this is less effective as a unified European middle class protest could and must be.  Certainly I think the most urgent issue is the rejection of failed neo-liberal economic theories which the old, wealthy, and powerful assert are as reliable as gravity.

1. Economic condition in Germany is  not that good either. It has bigger sovereign debt to GDP ratio than Spain.  These people just assume that Germany has it better without looking at numbers. 
2. Spain and Italy had their debt under control before crisis 2008. Italy had high debt but it's debt to GDP ratio was coming down. 

The crisis was caused by economies in eurozone being out of sync. When money from Germany moved freely to Spain and Italy, these countries did not have own monetary policy to do anything about bubble that excess money created after they had joined eurozone. 

Eurozone is not [optimum currency area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimum_currency_area) and that's the reason we are in trouble. ECB's monetary policy mostly reacts to what happens in the German economy because it's the biggest. It seems that the assumption is that other countries so something wrong if their economy is not in sync with Germany and must pay the price for it.

Add that to the chronic deficiencies of economies like Greece's and you get a really bad situation.

Puoi affrontare questo enigma così:

* Prendi un foglietto - se scrivi sul bersaglio non vedrai cosa stai facendo e finirai con un casino
* Cerca paia di parole che sono anagrammi, o che si formano cambiando, togliendo o aggiungendo una lettera, bla bla bla, secondo le istruzioni (ad es.: ASPRA/SPARA; SARA/SERA; FATA/FATTA; SERRA/SERA)
* Scrivi ogni paio trovato, unendo le parola con una linea (AMORE --- AROME; SARA --- SERA; FATA --- FATTA; SERRA --- SERA)
* Se una parola figura in due paia, puoi legarle (SARA --- SERA + SERA --- SERRA -&gt; SARA --- SERA --- SERRA)
* Cancella le parole unite nel bersaglio
* Cerca fra le parole che rimangono connessioni con le parole già legate
* Continua così finché hai legato tutte le parole

I've heard that it is difficult for a foreigner to build good friendships with the Dutch. Is this a myth perpetuated by people unwilling to assimilate, or do you think there is cultural segregation due to the Dutch being closer to their own?

I'm an Italian that has been living in NL for 2 years now, I can give my 2€cents :P

Regarding the attitude of Dutch people in general I've had nothing but positive experience: people are friendly, patient with the fact that after 2 years you can barely say 5 words in Dutch (man, it's a hard language), helpful and cheerful. It might be different in big cities, but in my town (pop. ~100.000) that's the way I perceive it.

The fact that building good friendships is not easy, that has been the case for me. But I chalk it up to the fact that I haven't been able to learn the language decently yet, so basically I think it's my fault.

The Netherlands have a quality of life that is vastly superior to that of southern Europe. If they had also a ""normal"" (from the point of view of a southerner) medical system and a decent climate it would probably be the best place ever.

▪ There are a few easy rules that let you decide which word you've got to use. You don't have to learn these rules by rote. Read them one time and you'll never forget them.

1.daß?

true,_delirium,DENK,Denmark,"I don't disagree with all of that, but #1 is definitely a slanted view, and I'd say most scholars who aren't either Greek or Macedonian have a different view. In particular, while Macedonia is located in the area where Macedon *originated*, by the 3rd century BC Macedonians had diffused considerably, as Alexander conquered a large empire, and the populations intermixed, with anyone important in Macedon being sent to govern places as far away as Afghanistan and Egypt. These mixed with other Greek-speaking populations, with Persian-speaking populations, and with Egyptians, among others. By the Hellenistic age (3rd-2nd centuries BC), the Macedonians had more or less diffused into a much larger territory, with various ethnic origins but generally Greek-speaking, and there was no longer any distinctly recognizable ""Macedonian"" ethnicity as such. It became just a generic term for Alexander's successors and the Greek-speaking rulers of the various Hellenistic kingdoms (e.g. the Ptolemies in Egypt).

So when various Slavic tribes assimilated local populations in the 7th century in what was once Macedon, as you point out, these populations weren't in any strong way ""Macedonians"" except by geographical location, as that ethnicity had ceased to be distinct several hundred years previously. Many of the people living there were indeed descended from the ancient Macedonians, but then so were many people in Egypt, the Peloponnese, and what's now Turkey. So by *ethnic* lineage it's not really clear anyone has a strong claim to being the descendants of Macedon, as a lot of people are (including many people in modern Macedonia, but also many people in modern Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Egypt, Italy, Turkey, and Iran). The Greek claim is mostly based on culture/language, as the Macedonians were a Greek-speaking tribe, and their conquering a large empire ushered in the Hellenistic Age.",0,1323122965,null,0,true,0,c35k1zu,t3_n114t,t1_c35k1zu,t1_c35jvdt,1427978094,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

If you really wanted, I could find you complaints about the OED. It is incomplete. It is a very valuable source and a good descriptive look at the English language, but it really isn't a complete look at the language and wouldn't help in many situations. First off it would neglect American English, which Webster's Third New International Dictionary is generally considered the standard. Likewise the Merriam–Webster's Dictionary of English Usage is highly acclaimed and provides many things the OED does not. The massive The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language is another work which supersedes what the OED provides. Yet even if you add up all of these works, none of it is ""official"", and rightly so.

Americans absolutely do give a shit about the OED. You will find plenty of Americans who falsely believe that the OED is *the* authority on the English language, despite the fact that none exist. (Also the fact that the OED, as a descriptive dictionary, wouldn't attempt to prescribe authority.) But Webster (or the prescriptive American Heritage Dictionary) probably are better known among the general public, it is true.

Now, it's a pretty complex dispute rooted in centuries of animosity between the two nations. The Wikipedia article does an OK job of explaining most of the issues, however it glosses over (or entirely omits) others. 

Macedonians the ancient mediterranean tribe that give their name to the region of Macedonia. Macedonians the modern slavic nation that took their name from the region of Macedonia. 

It would take a lot of time and effort to explain everything in detail, but here are the most notable Greek beliefs:

1.	there is an unbroken continuity since ancient times between the Ancient Macedonians and the people who live in modern Greek Macedonia, while the people who inhabit the Republic of Macedonia are mostly of Slavic origin 
2.	the modern Macedonians and Macedonia were ""created"" in 1945 
3.	some people in Greece on the extreme right have this irrational fear that we will invade their country in order to reclaim what our extreme right considers ""lost territories""/Aegean Macedonia 
4.	there are no (/have never been any) ethnic/national minorities in Greece (i.e. everyone who lives in Greece is an ethnic Greek, and that's that) 
And here are rebuttals to those opinions:
1.	When the Slavic tribes moved to the Balkans, they went as far south as Thessaloniki, most likely even further. Wherever they settled, they didn't slaughter or displace the native population They came with flowers in hands and love mixed and slowly assimilated them, except 1/3 of the country population that said assimilation was impossible. Even today giving the original inhabitants their language while taking many of their customs as their own. The twelve gods of Olymbus and virgin sacrifices.
2.	This is how different cultures and nations were born all over the Balkans and Eastern Europe. The point is, the ancient Macedonians didn't just vanish into thin air to be replaced by Slavs. The Macedonian culture was pretty much dead durring the Roman times after the  Roman conquest their culture was Roman. They mixed with them and over time the Slavs and the ancient Macedonians, Thracians, Paeonians, Bryges and other smaller tribes that at that time didn't exist as entities in the Roman world as they were already assimulated and lived in this territory became a more-or-less homogenous entity, what we call the modern (ethnic) Macedonians, and what the Greeks would call Slavomacedonians. Despite having no country of their own at the time, most of them considered themselves part of the same people. Ottomans of the Ottoman empire. And then there's the issue of the modern Greek Macedonians.. See, most of the people today who live in northern Greece are descendants of Christians who were settled there after the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913 (when Greece conquered that part of Macedonia) and the Greek-Turkish population exchange of 1923, when 1.5 million Christians (mostly Greeks and Armenians) were forcibly evicted from their homes in Turkey, while the same was done to Muslims in Greece. This radically changed the structure of the population in Greek Macedonia as the Greeks became a majority while the former Turkish majority went to Turkey. while they were previously a minority (or at most on-par with Macedonian and Turkish, Albanian, Bulgarian, Roma, and Jewish populations). So, those same people who hold the most extreme and vocal opinions have little to do with the people who lived on that land hundreds or thousands of years ago. While the people from Skopje the former capital of Kosovo have every right to do so.
3.	There are centuries-old folk songs in Macedonia that tell tales of the exploits of important Macedonian historical figures. Some of them were dedicated to Alexander the Great and his father Philip of Macedon. They are texts, and artifacts, and folk dresses with ancient symbols that tell of the existence of a distinct Macedonian ethnicity long before 1945 but they are so well hidden than no one can find them. There have to be a well orchestrated conspiracy. 
4.	Even though it's very silly to think that a tiny country such as the Republic of Macedonia can invade and cause any amount of trouble for a country with a (proportionately) huge army that is broke, such as the Hellenic Republic  even thought it has already done this in 1946-1949, since 1993 there are articles in the Macedonian Constitution which say that we relinquish any potential territorial demands/pretensions towards our neighbors. So, as ridiculous as it was 20 years ago, it's a moot point now. Remember during the 90s US will never again have a war with Irak? well it has never happen again.
5.	Today, there are somewhere around 30.000-50.000 ethnic Macedonians who live in several municipalities near the Greek-Macedonian border. A hundred years ago there were ten times as more. and 10 million years ago one hundred times more. What happened in the meantime is rarely spoken of (or even known outside the Balkans). There were the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913 when the Ottoman possessions in Europe (mostly the region of Macedonia) were conquered by and divided between Greece, Serbia and Bulgaria. There were two population exchanges: after the Balkan Wars between Greece and Bulgaria (Greeks from Bulgaria for Slavs with Bulgarian self-identity from Greece) and in 1923 between Greece and Turkey (explained above); those Macedonians who remained in Greece were subjected to an incredibly efficient policy of assimilation which included replacing the names of people and places with Greek names from the former Turkish, compulsory Greek education from 1970 and forbidding the population to speak any language but Greek because Greece is not a country living from tourism so it will be impossible to know any other language like English. The policy was strictly enforced and punishments for disobedience were severe. Bad grades in School, which forced tens of thousands of Macedonians to leave the country and move elsewhere, mostly overseas (the USA, Canada, Australia). Then there was the Greek Civil War of 1946-1949 where the Macedonians in Greece fought for one of the sides the Communist, which turned out to be the losing one. 100.000 people left the country before the end of the war, tens of thousands of which were Macedonian children sent by their parents all over Europe and many of them Albanian or Greek without their parents permision (the ""children-refugees of the Greek Civil War"" or ""децата бегалци""), who are, to this day, not allowed to return to or even visit Greece at all without a passport. It wasn't until the late 1970s/early 1980s when trouble was brewing in Yugoslavia that Greece became interested in Macedonia. In fact, it was in 1987 that Northern Greece was renamed into Macedonia before that it was named North and Southern Greece was named South.",0,1323135557,null,0,false,0,c35m2uu,t3_n114t,t1_c35m2uu,t1_c35ih9l,1427979048,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

In a short summary: The standard of the English language based on the region you live in but, because there is no official standard, you aren't wrong if you, for instance, write a text in a ways that's not the standard in your region.

That would mean that basically the only important difference between the different standards are totally different words or different meanings of words. I think a American would be really surprised if you ask him if he fancy a fag break and a Brit would be quite shocked if someone would take his trousers off and say ""I just have to change my pants for the bar we're going to visit"".

its a beautiful beautiful place. And old shopping mall in the jewish quarter, became the HQ for the Nazi SS, was bombed in WW2.

I'm glad your experience has been so positive. That is great to hear. I'm sure people in bigger cities, like anywhere, will prefer to keep to themselves a bit more than in smaller ones. However, I don't doubt that in general the Dutch are friendly, helpful people. I have heard this often.

That's interesting that you have not learnt the language. I've heard it is very difficult for a foreigner to learn the language, because the Dutch don't mind switching to English at all, and there are many expat communities in Holland, so it actually becomes hard to make yourself learn. I've heard some expats say that they didn't learn Dutch until they married one!

Though I'm not exactly an expert in learning languages, I strongly suggest making it something of a necessity by asking friends to only speak to you in Dutch, and trying to isolate yourself from things otherwise. I know many immigrants that come to the US from Brazil and after more than a decade can't speak English because of not trying to assimilate.

If the german tax office thinks a german company evades german taxes using a subsidiary/holding/whatever in Luxembourg, then they can sue that company and get a german prosecutor to file an international request with the luxembourgish authorities. Luxembourgish police will then seize evidence related to that request and hand it over to the german prosecution. This happens every day.

To request a seizure, the german prosecution must however have a ""lead"". They can't ask Luxembourg to fetch them ""ALL the information"". In practice, they will ask to seize all known information about a certain customer at a certain bank.

Nations like Germany and France are cracking down on tax evasion. They want Luxembourg to notify them of all transactions involving one of their nationals. This would be a huge violation of privacy, and I doubt it will ever happen.

 Instead listen to what Kiro Gligorov, former PM of FYROM had to say [in this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyYa3AMtXr4&amp;feature=related) back in 1992.

 Or watch this interview with another former FYROM PM, Ljubco Georgievski, in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQL45bVtsZk&amp;feature=related) who explains things in more detail.

 One ex-Foreign Minister of FYROM also added a very interesting viewpoint [in this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujCUOveqhpw&amp;feature=related).

 Then again, in search for an answer, you could turn to academics. Let's see  what Robin Lane Fox, an English historian, currently a Fellow of New College, Oxford and University of Oxford Reader in Ancient History, has to say about Macedonian history in [this short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55tGPVKi3rw).

 I can't be bothered to argue about all the propaganda and half truths (lies) i see in this thread, but i have to say claiming  ""In short, the real problem Greece has with Macedonia isn't the name, but the existence of a Macedonian nation in any shape and form"" is totally missing the point. 
 
 The problem here is not just the name or the claim that the true Macedonian nation is the slavic population that moved in the general area millennia after Alexander and his forefathers established their Hellenic kingdom. It is the nationalist politics, the mind-numbing propaganda in FYROM schools (I've had a guy from Skopje tell me that Alexander was speaking slavic..) and the circulation of propaganda material in general - the internet is rife with people arguing their perverse case, all drawing sources from some propaganda websites.

 So for me, the biggest issue is things like FYROM having a PM that does acts this, seen in this [pic](http://i.imgur.com/n23mH.jpg). What am i supposed to think as a Greek (more so with half my family coming from Macedonia - I mean the Greek province of Macedonia of course)? Am i supposed to think it's all good and Greeks are bad for objecting to all this, or that FYROM's current policies are breeding ignorance, hate, nationalism, etc? Why should i agree that FYROM be named Macedonia, when they consider 30% of Greece to be part of their version of F.Y.R.O.Macedonia and their PM is posing in front of their national monument with a map like that attached?

 The raping of logic, history and scientific thinking in general will not be tolerated by me (I hope more and more people in FYROM will take this stance). I have nothing against the people of FYROM. I wish one day we can have normal relations. But its mostly up to them to start re-educating themselves and see this issue from our viewpoint as well. I cannot tell them what they will call themselves, i can however voice my objections where we disagree. But moreover, a line has to be drawn somewhere. I would draw it in front of the lies that corrupt their kids' minds and breed mutual resentment and hate in both sides. 

 In the end, if people in FYROM consider themselves Macedonians and descendants of Alexander the Great (no matter how illogical that is) they should see Greeks as brothers. After all, the life work of Philip and Alexander was uniting the Hellenes to fight against our common enemy at the time, the Persians. He called himself leader of the Greeks. He spread our culture and language, as his teacher Aristotle -a student of Plato- taught him. ",0,1323182612,null,0,false,0,c35r1t9,t3_n114t,t1_c35r1t9,t1_c35os7t,1427981467,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

*""Here is the correct answer: the commissioners have no problem with straight bananas, it's the crooked ones they don't like so much, but they have never banned them. As Commission Regulation (EC) 2257/94 puts it, bananas must be ""free from malformation or abnormal curvature"". In the case of ""Extra class"" bananas, there is no wiggle room, but Class 1 bananas can have ""slight defects of shape"", and Class 2 bananas can have full-on ""defects of shape"".*

*No attempt is made to define ""abnormal curvature"" in the case of bananas, which must lead to lots of arguments. Contrast the case of cucumbers (Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1677/88), where Class I and ""Extra class"" cucumbers are allowed a bend of 10mm per 10cm of length. Class II cucumbers can bend twice as much. ""*

In general, there's no degree required, though companies may have their own requirements. I *assume* if you can take a job legally in Germany, and you find a company to train you, there's nothing stopping you. 

There are *[staatlich anerkannte Ausbildungsberufe](http://www2.bibb.de/tools/aab/aabberufeliste.php)* (officially recognized apprenticeship professions) which generally have higher recognition.
