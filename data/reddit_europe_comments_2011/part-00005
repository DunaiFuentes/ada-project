Other than that both countries are more than willing for reforms and have an overwhelming public support for the EU and democracy. As soon as we get the corruption and decay caused by the collapse of the old system under control things are going to be a little bit more pink.. pinkish. Other that that the EU is not all about the freaking money. It's also about family and making sure nobody is left behind. It's a cold and unforgiving world out there.

Nevertheless Romania and Bulgaria are kept away from the honey. We're not even allowed in Schengen yet.. so the EU is more cautious than a lot of people think.

I did not bring NATO in connection with Stalin or his purges (NATO 1949; the purges 1936-38). You did. I did not in any way mention Stalin, but only to say that while he was murdering people the KKK in america had over 5 million members. It means that it was a fucked up time and you can generalize soviet socialism judging by Stalin as much as you can generalize American democracy judging by the KKK. Socialism does not mean totalitarianism. What he did cannot be called repressive mechanism, it was as you stated ""great terror"" (although I think ""cleansing"" is a more fitting term). I was talking about the repressive mechanisms at the time of NATO, the Cold War (1947-1989) and after Stalin freed the world of his presence. Stalin's genocide and the repression - two greatly different things. Mass murder is not repression.. it's a lot worse.... it's freaking genocide. Please think about it.

&gt;come to think of it, the height of the Cold War actually coincided with a lessening of terror in the Soviet Union, after the death of Stalin.

I wonder why this didn't give you a hint as to what I was saying.

&gt;You want my thoughts on the US crimes in South America during the Cold War, you'll be able to find them in threads that are about those.

The point was that repression and shitty politics happened on the other side of the world as well, which means the times were bad for everyone, generally. The difference is that you don't see so much aggressive criticism against American politics in the given period. Why? Because it's easier to repeat 1960 anti soviet propaganda like a parrot than actually think about what criticism really consist of.

true,breads,PACA,PACA,"I'm not French, but having lived in Paris I can tell you that it really depends on where you are in the city and how well you know French. In touristy areas (which, let's face it, is a lot of Paris), shops will have English-speaking employees. In such places, French phrases - 'oui', 'non', 'merci', 'je voudrais une crêpe' and the like - are effectively unnecessary, but they are nice gestures. If you're going to, say, a grocery store, however, I would be more prepared to speak in French.

If you attempt to speak the language and are clearly not fluent, the French tend to continue to force English on you. I've found this to be the case in a lot of situations: sometimes it's that they want to practice their English, others that they don't believe you could speak passable French. If, on the other hand, you are clearly able to interact past basic guidebook phrases, it will definitely be appreciated but you're unlikely to receive praise or anything.

So I would say that, in general, it's best to use what French you have, but be aware that it won't always be reciprocated or outwardly appreciated.  Sometimes people will be rude, but usually they won't.  Most of all, don't simply assume that people speak English, as that sort of presumptuousness won't go over well except at places like the Louvre or Montmartre.

Just because most people don't know or care shouldn't mean that we should simply lower the level of discourse. A language should evolve from new concepts and cultural ideas not from stupidity. 

Though I agree that there are a few types of errors (such as misspellings due to speed of typing or uncommon words) that are acceptable and shouldn't be frowned much upon if the message is not confusing. But I must confess it seems beyond idiotic to me for a native speaker to mistake ""your"" for ""you're"", ""its"" for ""it's"" etc. To me that means the person doesn't really grasp the structure of his/her own language, it relies only on the ""sound"" of the words which pretty much resembles a bat finding its bearing through echolocation but being totally oblivious of the world surrounding it.
I'm not encouraging a grammar jihad, far from it (I despise fundamentalistic and narrow minded approaches by default) but certainly the sloppy grammar skills erodes the confidence of a message and hinders or delays the agreement with it.

In dutch they would be written the same and you have to get the meaning from context - which works perfectly for us. So for me the english spelling system seems a bit artificial, as in: a way to show differences in meaning through creating artificial differences in spelling. But I must add there are certain spelling rules in dutch that are based on very complex rules that have nothing to do with the spoken language of today, and sometimes do not even have anything to do with our language at all.

However, I do no agree when people start giving SMS/LOL-speak as an example of degrading language skills and our pending doom - if that is what you also mean with stupidity/mediocrity. For me that way of writing could be seen as a new form of expression - and the interesting part is that it is almost pure text based, not based on spoken language, it is based on speed. And since history shows us that people will always try to express complicated thoughts, I am sure it will develop into something more complicated.

true,finisterra,PORT,Portugal,"&gt;What do you dislike about the flag?

Thanks for asking; since you're the guy behind this thing I'll assume you're into flags, hence my longish answer.

I like the coat-of-arms. I dislike everything else, namely the red/green combination which is:

- Something completely alien in terms of symbolism in Portuguese history
- Something that looks horrible together
- Something that breaks heraldic rules, which is the least of my concerns vexillology isn't bound to heraldic rules, it just so happens that the rules have a reason to exist most of the times.

You didn't ask, but let me say that my position has *nothing* to do with any sort of political position related to monarchy vs. republic. It's a simple matter of not feeling any degree with empathy for this flag from both an historical and aesthetic perspective. I'm saying this because the issue is also polarised by this.

I'm not alone in this, some forums (especially history-minded ones) have two other flags for Portugal, either one that is just the coat of arms in a banner, and another that looks like yours, only with a blue cross. This debate is at least as old as the republic (so, a century). The wikipedia article on the Portuguese flag is quite good, especially in visual terms, and you'll quickly see that the last revision was the one that most completely disregarded past ones.

As I said, the coat-of-arms is a completely different thing, and there I find to be one of the best in visual terms, being both somewhat simple and highly distinguishable at the same time.",0,1296757720,null,0,false,0,c1fcgae,t3_elxyi,t1_c1fcgae,t1_c1fbz73,1426739377,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I also think one should do its best to write as clearly as possible, and I usually only get pissed at people who correct other people, when it is very clear to me and others what they meant.

Because meaning changes all the time, as does grammar, etc. It should not be stopped by stupid conservatism. 

Without Shakespeare 'to copulate' would not mean what it does today. Do we have Shakespeares around here? No. Or maybe: not yet. It might be that creating a persona here - or anywhere else on the internet - could develop into the same thing as writing theatre 500 years ago. Instead of writing for actors you are the actor.

There is also definitely something to be said for neologisms and creativity with language. Sometimes mistakes can even lead to lovely almost-literary expressions. 

Still, if we have a Shakespeare in our midst, we can only tell in hindsight. I'm curious to see how long lolcat-slang will be around, for instance, and - if it sticks - how long it takes for grammarians to accept 'I can haz'  as a linguistically correct expression.  The problem with the arising of a new Shakespeare is that of access. People have access to so much more information and entertainment that the chance of someone ever having the same amount of pull (in one language area) ever again, is rather small, I think. On the one hand, when things go viral, they can be seen in many different places and may seep through to different social groups. But (I have no numbers) I would be surprised if anything can ever have the same impact as Shakespeare had, because there is such an astonishing amount of 'noise'  around.

true,yurigoul,NETH,Dutchy in Berlin,"&gt;I would be surprised if anything can ever have the same impact as Shakespeare had, because there is such an astonishing amount of 'noise' around.

The big difference 15th century england and 21st century world is:
- In Shakespeare's time communication was less and slower. You could even - in theory - read all the books that were known in that time
- In our time communication is more, but faster. People will process more information than there were books in Shakespeare's time.

Based on that it should be possible to have a new Shakespeare in our midst and eventually find out about it since we are all processing so much more information.

Another thing is that there are Shakespeares all around us all the time - but not all of them invented as many words as he did. We are both Dutch so I can come up with two or three examples from our language:
- Maarten Toonder from O. Bommel fame, invented the word 'Denkraam'. And there were other words as well.
- Koot en de Bie invented several words and sayings, but can not recall any directly from memory.
- Commercials are of big influence on our language (dutch). 'Helaas pindakaas' for instance. Same goes for movies in an international setting. 'I'll be back' is laden with meaning it would not have had without the movie.

&gt;But if an experienced mechanic tinkers with my engine, (s)he can probably make it run faster and smoother than I would have been able to do ever.

A mechanic is someone who is specialized in using tools almost no one else uses on a daily basis.

Since ware all able to speak, and we are all human beings with brains that are made to distinguish patterns and therefor understand language and also use language, we therefor are all mechanics. Language is an instrument ruled by democratic forces. Shakespeare made his joke about 'copulating peasants', but if nobody had understood what he meant it would have gone nowhere. (And if Shakespeare had been a Klingon he would of course have had no influence at all - /nerdy joke alert)

There might be people who are better at using language than others, but I resent the idea you have to be able to understand hermetic poetry first before you are licensed to tinker with it. Kids do it all the time, it might even be seen as the way they come to master the language - and therefor learn to be socially active, learn to be members of our language/sign based culture. Learning and playing helps young brains develop into grown up brains.

The american brand of english was not developed by Shakespeares, it was developed by poor people, refugees, mostly coming from non-english speaking countries. Because of the dutch influence, the word Yankee was added (Jan-Kees, a dutch name), the german influence added the word 'Dollar' (Thaler, the region were silver was found).

Just to frame it in a wider context, the problem is one of scale and not of a huge difference in behaviour: there are much less gypsies in Portugal and they also live separately, either in encampments or attempts at putting them in public housing which soon turn into a slum.

The pragmatism in this is such that local districts/department run by the Communist Party (which one would assume would be more sensible to this issue, at least in theory) built public housing for gypsies in a separate location outside of the city boundaries.

&gt;Why don't you integrate into theirs? It's not like they are immigrants.

That's something that in theory is true, but everyone that says it knows that the reality disproves it. Yes, they are not immigrants (and even if they were you could say the same, I know I have heard it plenty of times, ""there is no worse/better"", etc etc) but almost nobody recognises them as being ""truly national"" more than in their passport. Including themselves, since recent polls have showed that they feel a much higher degree of empathy and allegiance with Spanish gypsies than in terms of nationality.

This is not something particular, it's the same all over Europe: they aren't immigrants, but they aren't considered as ""natives"", whatever that means. I know I'm not explaining myself very well but I hope those reading understand the reality I'm trying to describe.

An example: we have received a decent amount of Eastern European workers in the last decade (I know, things must really be shitty there if they are coming here, this is what I say to some of my friends which came from Eastern Europe). In general there were only two problems: organised crime, that almost exclusively targets these communities, and gypsies. Because of concerns about racism/xenophobia related to gypsies the news outlets for a while talked about ""Romanians"" and ""Bulgarians"", which was in turn considered extremely offensive by Romanians and Bulgarians...

&gt;You may not like it, but they're a non-immigrant minority, they have their rights, and keeping their culture is one of those.

The problem here is that all the talk about integrating minorities, used especially for recent immigration from Africa, is based on selling the idea that what matters is cultural identity. Which is why saying the opposite for gypsies is complex. It is also assumed that a distinct cultural identity fosters segregation, which is somewhat true but IMO doesn't mean that the solution is to force people to drop theirs.

Unless you're talking about 100% private schools (that still follow the required public curriculum), this goes against everything that a pluralistic, democratic, modern society stands for.  And when you start talking about private schools, that's obviously incompatible with your proposal to use tax money that you make below.

Most countries in Europe have experienced migrations.  Spanish/Portuguese workers and farm hands, Italian railway workers, Turkish, Albanian, Serbian, Polish, etc. - all have eventually integrated, given time.  In some countries, some are still integrating.  the moment you start allowing various ethnic and/or cultural communities to run their own publicly funded schools outside the public school system, you send the message that these groups are not bound by the laws and standards that the rest of the community is obliged to adhere to.  

When you immigrate to a country, you obey the laws and you make an effort to join its community.  In return, the host country is obliged to make an honest effort to give you the resources to join.  We can argue that the latter is not happening as effectively as it could.  ""Cultural identity"" is nice and all, but it has zero place in this scenario if it is at odds with the law of the land you've come to.

_Edit:_ It just occurred to me that this might be construed as being anti-immigrant.  Far from it.  Europe needs more, and more diverse immigration.  Economic and cultural fresh blood keeps countries healthy and dynamic, something that many European societies are desperately in need of.
