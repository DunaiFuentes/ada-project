Selbst ein Foto, dass man ja bei einem 1/2^n Faktor schon mal selbst skalieren könnte, lass ich doch lieber den machen der das Original (und Photoshop) hat und die Kompression dann so machen kann wie er will -- falls es zu groß (in Bytes) zurück kommt, kann man sich ja hinterher immer noch beschweren.

Jetzt änderst du die Größe auf 75x75 Pixel, und das Ergebnis ist eine Linie die weiterhin zwei Pixel dick ist.

C'est précisément dans un soucis d'égalité qu'aucune religion n'est prise en compte lors du choix des dates de concours. Il serait impossible de se conformer au calendrier de chaque religion tant elles sont nombreuses. A partir de là, comment voudrais-tu organiser une cession d'examen ?

Things to remember:

1) Don't worry too much about Visas. If you work for an American company and are paid in USD then I wouldn't worry. I would simply enter as tourist and stay (I know an American girl that has lived in Italy for about 2years entering/leaving every couple of months and was not stopped once)

2) You will probably have some difficulties opening a 'proper' bank account. However, if you need a Euro account you can try with an American bank or try to get a prepaid card that as an IBAN code embossed. Unicredit or Banca Sella offer this product,that card will work exactly like a bank account (sending/receiving cash via bank transfer), you will be able to pay in shops or withdraw money from an ATM. The requirements to get that type of cards are less stringent than to get a full bank account (I know it because my GF has one, she is not Italian/EU and was unable to get a bank account without a VISA (Permesso di soggiorno)).

3) You need to learn Italian if you want to get plumber. Not many people can speak English. If you speak Spanish then learn Italian shouldn't be difficult. The cities with more English/American expats are Florence, Rome and Milan. 

4) Don't expect to get the same sort of Broadband/Phone service that you get in US. Everything is more expensive. However, you can find a couple of providers that work very well (i.e. NGI). Cable is available via Fastweb albeit there are some restrictions on the stuff you can do.

5) If you have a prepaid card as for point 2 then you can transfer money from abroad without problem. Try to have a look on xe.com for exchange rates.

6) As someone said, bureaucracy is completely fucked. Had my fair share of problems trying to get my gf legally here and to things by the book. We just gave up and she is now entering/leaving without registering as she should but no-one ever asked anything or cares (she is not western/white)..I guess that as American you will even less problems.",0,1302716427,null,0,false,0,c1p89eq,t3_gmjjm,t1_c1p89eq,t3_gmjjm,1427063601,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

I can't stress enough that *you are responsible for you entire application process*. That means that so many things can go wrong, but *you* will have to be informed about every step. Just ask around, but calculate to spend days on research and filling papers out on your own. 

 Another thing to keep in mind is that at almost every university the application process is different -sometimes slightly, sometimes significantly. So, in general, I would advise you to search for a few potential unis, then search their sites for the specific process. You might also want to search for each unis international office and make a few calls to them. Not speaking German will be a pain, but it should be manageable with business degrees. 

You could start at the uni frankfurt and check some others on the way (Fu or HU Berlin, ULM or TU München are always good choices) or check at http://ranking.zeit.de/che2010/en/faecher for the school rankings.

I would strongly recommend going with a host family, though there are some exceptions already mentioned (mainly food).  I would not worry too much about rules put in place, Americans (I'm assuming that's what you are) are very prudish compared to most of Europe.  I can't begin to count how many times the Spanish guys have told me that I need to experience the Spanish women.  When I tell them that I already have a girlfriend, they always say ""well, she doesn't have to know.""  They didn't really seem to be kidding, either.

Anyway, one thing to keep in mind about Spain: in the US, families take students studying abroad (especially in high school) and treat them like a member of the family... going on lots of excursions, taking them out, etc.  In Spain, it's done as an economic necessity.  You're more of a renter than anything else, and usually middle-lower class families are more likely to do it.  Don't let that discourage you, though.  I was a little nervous when I first read about that in my study-abroad program's literature, but ultimately I had an amazing host mom.  Really good cook, and I'd join her at the bars occasionally.

One of my favorite memories was when my roommates were out of town for a weekend, and my plans fell through.  My host mom was going to her sister's slightly outside of town for her nephew's birthday party, and invited me since I'd be all alone otherwise.  The kid was only turning 11, but there was a full day of food, socializing, music, and dancing that night.  I was literally there 8-9 hours, talking with the different people in the family and playing with the kids a little bit.  You just can't get that with your own apartment.

Do you have to find your own accomodation? I'd strongly suggest looking outside Paris if so. They recently removed a law which stated that dwellings had to be minimum of 15 square metres (or something like that) - now every rich douchebag with a basement is converting it into an ""apartment"" and charging €600+ a month for some dark, subterranean crap-hole of 11 square metres or so. Building standards in France are already pretty ... poor (sorry French people, but that shit just wouldn't fly in other European countries) - exposed cables, really badly insulated buildings so condensation forms on the walls in the winter and turns mouldy, leaky pipes - it's something very common in older buildings. If you can I'd strongly recommend finding a place in the suburbs just outside Paris - anywhere along the RER train lines and you'll never be more than 1 hour max train ride from Paris. It takes about 30 minutes from Versailles. You may want to check out the following websites to see some prices and potentially find a place to live:

[PAP](http://www.pap.fr/)

[Se Loger](http://www.seloger.com/)

[A Louer](http://www.avendrealouer.fr/)

You'll be looking at a minimum of €500 a month for an apartment, even a tiny place, somewhere in Paris... they can be had for a minimum of about €400 in the suburbs. Factoring in roughly €70 for a monthly transport ticket and things being cheaper in general outside of Paris I'd say being outside is your best option personally, but it depends how much of a party animal you are and how much time you're likely to want to spend in Paris in the evenings/nights.

First Polish surnames that come to my mind are Klaus-Rüdiger Landowsky (Politician, ""Godfather of Berlin"") Cardinal Sterzinsky and Hagen Saberschinsky (former President of Berlin's Police). No, no problem here. There are some resentments in the lesser educated classes but it's fading rapidly since German craftsmen are finding better paid jobs in Poland.

As for madrid. public transport is decent. you have 2 train systems :

- Metro : which is centered on the city center itself but has some lines leading to the suburbs. 

- Cercanias : this is mostly outer city suburb based with several inner city stations. 

you have 2 major rail stations which is chanmartin (northen station) and Atocha (southern station). 

Another interesting option is is the 27 bus which goes all the way from plaza castilla to atocha crossing the entire main avenue of madrid. the Castellana. just beware of pick pockets. 

Now travel on any bus is 1 euro a ride. same on the metro. the cercanias goes from 1.20 to 2.50 depending on destination. you can buy a 10 ride ticket for 9 euros which works on inner city buses and metro. theres also a monthly  subscription which can be done on the spot in any tabaco shop. all you need is ID and valid passport photo. it costs between 48 euros and 114 depending on the range. 48 being inner city A zone, while a E2 would give you access to ALL the suburbs. but most of the cool stuff are in A and the price differance is ridiculous. its cheaper to just buy the ticket. mind that you cant use the ticket for multiple people becuase the ticket automaticly locks when used in a train or metro station for around 5-10 minutes to make sure you dont pass multiple people. but the ticket allows you to travel freely on all EMT trains and buses aswell as free metro access. 

when visiting central areas like atocha, sol, callao. be aware there are large numbers of pick pockets. mostly romanian gypsys which target tourists. 

eating for cheap is easy. most bars will offer a small tapa with a glass of beer. usualy ranging from 1 euro to 2.50, but there are specific bars like El tigre is chueca or la blanca paloma in the deeper zones of tribunal. they will allow you to eat low/mid quality versions of spanish classics for dirt cheap, just be careful becuase they are usualy stuffed. 

Museums like el prado or reina sofia are free sunday afternoons. also near the reina sofia you have the la caixa cultural center that usualy has nice expositions. 

In sol you can visit plaza mayor. and the san miguel food market. going a bit deeper you reach la latina which is a very nice place for bars and restorants aswell as a classical part of the city which is worth visiting. 

the major ""drinking"" areas are Alonso martinez (mostly high school kids), Tribunal/malasaña (more indie) and huertas (behind sol, a bit more high class).

Famous clubs you have pacha near alonso martinez and kapital near atocha. Pacha is world famous as a clubbing brand, while kapital is known for being a old converted theater with 7 floors (they even have a small cinema). 

you can get a prepay cellphone for cheap. i suggest you get a simyo or yoigo terminal which are cheap. you could probobly walk away with a basic GSM phone and around 20 euros in credit for around 50-70 euros.
just careful where you buy it, the phone house (carphone warehouse spanish branch) shops are common, just look under ""ultimas unidades"". they usualy have offers on older phones.  CDMA/EVDO phones DONT WORK IN SPAIN. you need a phone that can basicly do GSM 900/1800 and is simlock free if you want to bring your own phone. Mind that since the atocha bombings in madrid all simcards must be registred with a valid ID. so mind what you do with the simcard after you leave spain. if anyone does anything weird with it even after you left spain your name still comes up when you check it. so remember to either take it with you or cancel it before you leave.

TU Darmstadt, Karlsruhe, TU Stuttgart and Erlangen are afaik more technically oriented schools (though they all have a business engineering programm, so they have a business department)

Heidelberg is probably among the most prestigeous German universities.

Just have a look at those in the area and take two or three days to go see them, maybe sit in a lecture (nobody gives a shit), walk around on campus etc. I found that highly beneficial when deciding where I wanna go.

If you know where you wanna go, you could also contact the ""Akademisches Auslansamt"" of the Uni and try to get an appointment for the time whe you are there.

Given that you are a EU citizen and from my personal experience there is very few UK citizens at German Unis, you may even have the benefit that a quota-system works for you in terms of admission.

tl;dr: Check out the Universities near Friedberg. See if they offer something that may interest you.

&gt; Is Germany racist towards Polish surnames?

I don't have one so I'm not the right person to answer that, but generally, Polish surnames aren't uncommon, especially not in the Ruhr Area.

&gt; Are the German people hung up on appearances?

Depends on where you go, which sector, and whether you will have contact with customers. At a bank in Munich there might be problems, but as long as a suit covers them up you should be fine. My local supermarket employs punks, but they are common in the area so even elderly ladies are used to them by now. In HR, you won't be ""the face of the company,"" so I wouldn't expect this to be a deal breaker. Generally, though, the South is more conservative than the North.

&gt; Are there Jobs?

Depends where and on the sector. There is a shortage in qualified labor, in engineering it's particularly bad (or good, if you're an engineer.) It's probably easier to find a job in HR than getting a manufacturing job that doesn't require any special qualifications.  
[Unemployment](http://www.spiegel.de/flash/flash-12125.html) in the South is very low, more in the North, and it's bad in the East. Large cities tend to have higher unemployment as well.

second of all, the quickest and easiest way to find a place is to use an agency, but be prepared to pay. if you have the money to spend, you can be living in a furnished apartment within a week. however, the agency fee is usually at least one full month of rent (think, 800 euros minimum). 

if you dont have the money to spend like that, be prepared for searching for a while. you will find people offering places, make contact with them, set up a visit, and then have them flake at the last minute. you will also find people lying about the quality of the place, everything you can imagine. it took me one month exactly to find what i was looking for. i visited one apartment which was going to be shared with an 80 year old lady, but the condition was i couldnt have any girls there and i couldnt ever use the kitchen. that is just one example of the kind of stuff you will encounter.

honestly, the cheapest way to go is either a) in the suburbs or b) with a roommate in a tiny apartment. the suburbs honestly arent too bad, plus there are some that have the metro nearby (zone 2) where it will take you about 20 minutes to get to the center of paris. but trust me, you usually wont be hanging out in the center of paris (at least that is the case with all of the french people i know).

the website i used to find a place is: appartager.com or something like that (google it). On that site, there are a lot of criteria you can enter, the catch is that you cant see anyones phone numbers or read their emails (unless *they* are a premium (paid) member). Personally, I paid, i think it was 25 euros or something and it was really nice to be able to contact people at will.

first off I really appreciated your post and had a decent giggle reading about the necessity of putting together a ""flatting guide"". I am a student of literature and politics who has lived in New Zealand twice for each more than half a year. I am German and thus can basically compare the tow ""lifestyles"" with regards to the flatting experience quite well.
Two things startled me while I was flatting with two Kiwis. Ropoama and Maria, both of proud Maori decent were absolutely brilliant quality flatmates. However, from my german perspective it was difficult to get used to not having the whole ""HELLO HOW HAS YOUR DAY BEEN TYPE OF CONVERSATION"" when you enter the flat. Its absolutely normal and while I got used to it I saw the potential in not having to break off a conversation when someone enters the flat. Once you sit down or the situation lends itself to a nice chat you go ahead and exchange some comments about stuff. Do not misunderstand me, I felt very welcome in the flat but its just that a lift of the eyebrow is definetely a long enough ""hello"". 
I loved it how we cooked in turns and that there was never a grand chat about who payed the rice last week. We all chipped in and thus enjoyed having food from the fridge. However, there is the concept of Luxury goods. chocolate or in fact any other drug is mostly bought by your flatmate with the intention of eating it.
When its cold get a blanket and make an event of it. Snoggle up have a few luxury goods and enjoy the evening.
That must basically be it. I can think of a few more things but I do not know whether you were thinking about those types of ideas. What is your task and where do you work.

Very little companies do reach the size they think English is relevant at all - the Bahn, for instance, but then only on the major lines, and then mostly for passing travellers. International corporations with major foreign contacts, such as Siemens. Banks, especially the counter business, are very local and customer-oriented, and English plays no role in this. 

We do believe that someone wanting to live in our country better learn our language. We don't like people separating themselves and forming ""social ghettos"" and subcultures. We do have a major problem with the Turkish community ""not wanting to integrate into our society"". 

We certainly won't encourage this behavior with other groups, such as the Australians/British/American group.

Phone company. It took me about 2 months to get the right one. I finally settled on blau. They are the only ones I could get a prepaid data plan (I took over my iPhone). The other companies either charge you per MB or 100 kB or want you to go on a 24 month contract (no such thing as a 12 month phone contract there). With blau I could choose a data pack or ""daten-tarif"". They just changed the name of their plans by the look of it, but I had the ""Internet-Flat XL"" which is 9.90 euro for 1GB to be used in 30 days. After that you can still use data, but it'll just be slower. ""Flat"" usually means unlimited, so in this case it's unlimited (i.e. you'll never be charged more than 9.90 euro) but it just gets slow. The site actually just went down for maintenance as I was checking it, but they do have an unlimited plan (I think it's the Flat XXL) which is actually unlimited. Not sure how much. Oh and the good thing is you can do everything online with them, including loading up on new credit. They even let you set it to be automatic. I had it so if I reached 5 euro in credit to put another 20 on automatically. Worked brilliantly.


Where are you going to be staying most of the time? That'll decide how far you can travel really. Train across the country takes about 8 hours. That's what took for me from Konstanz (far south-west) to Berlin. Regardless of where you're staying, you do have to see Berlin and Munich. They both have a lot of history and it's a great way to see how very different Germany is within itself. 

Not much special in Frankfurt tbh, it's just a business city really. I've heard really good things about Colonge (Köln), and Hamburg.

Wherever it is you're staying, you'll be able to buy tickets just for your state and go anywhere within that state for the fixed price (usually not too expensive, and with the one I got you could share the same ticket with up to 5 people, so the more that travel with you, the cheaper it is for everyone). So you'll be able to travel easily and quickly within your state. Try finding out about some smaller cities in your state.

EDIT: Maybe I should have read the other replies, sorry. You're in Bonn. Well, that's great for travelling. You'll be close to the Netherlands too, I would strongly recommended visiting it! I've heard Ghent is a nice place.

I studied in Konstanz, which is on the Bodensee in south-west Germany. It's a very nice place and a great place to visit in summer! I'd recommend checking it out! It's right on the lake and is the beginning of the Rhine river. There are views of the alps too. 

In Switzerland, I would recommend skipping Zurich tbh (other than a few hours), it's not anything too special. Hit up Bern if you can, it's beautiful. I've heard good things abot Basel, too.

In Austria, I'm really bummed out that I didn't get to go to Salzburg, as I had friends go and love it. So I'd recommend that!

In Germany, Mannheim, Stuttgart, Strasbourg (OK it's in France, but on the border), Ulm, Nürnberg are all reachable for you.

Adesso ci sono zone dove e' meglio non andare di sera, a causa di gruppi di nordafricani (potevano essere italiani, sarebbe stato lo stesso) che causano problemi. Settimanalmente ci sono risse e schiamazzi quotidiani.
Entrano ed escono di galera e quando le forze dell'ordine intervengono, questi tipi non si fanno vedere per un paio di giorni...poi tornano.

Concerning the recommendation by the Advocate General (which the court follows in ca 3/4 of cases), it's very specific to the situation in Belgium (no explicit law) and cannot be directly applied to e.g. France (Three-Strikes-Law). Also, sadly typical for EU institutions, the AG places as much emphasis on the lack of monetary compensation for the providers as on the infringement of civil liberties. 

Edit: Just to clarify, it's the AG's job to prepare, in complete independance, a legal opionion for the court in complex cases.

true,finisterra,PORT,Portugal,"&gt;Could you elaborate on this?

Sure. Let me however begin by saying that while I have several opinions on the subject I have no illusion that these are complex matters and my positions can be simplistic, wrong, or both.

I'm assuming that Finland's economy is no island and that it depends on the economy of their neighbours, but especially Germany and others Central/Eastern European countries.

The bailout in Portugal is not something that the rest of Europe received by surprise or with concern: strong pressures existed from European bodies for months prior to the capitulation urging Portugal to throw the towel to the floor. The reason for this is that the often talked about alternative - defaulting - would have a much broader impact. Had Portugal chosen to default and restructure the debt (something I think would have served our interest better) this would have an impact on the financial institutions that were exposed to this debt, not unlike the drama with Iceland. In particular, the banking systems of France, Germany and Spain would be affected.

A look at the situation in Spain in terms of the ""Cajas"", but also the ones from several banks in Germany which failed the stress-tests (the value of which are a separate debate), would most likely mean that the situation would deteriorate quickly. Especially so given the impact in Spain, which would then have an even bigger impact on the rest of the countries.

My comment was about this: if Portugal defaults that has an immediate impact on several banking institutions in several countries. The notation agencies, serving their own veiled interests, would immediately start attacking Spain, which would worsen the situation. At that point Spain could also default (even because the sheer size of it makes any debate about a bailout of Portugal seem like pennies). Given that a vast majority of the money was ""borrowed"" from German banking institutions (among others), this would have a huge impact and at the very least would mean mass bankruptcy of financial institutions or, in alternative, an extremely large bailout promoted by the Central Banks of the affected countries.

This would, in any case, have an effect on the economy of said countries, which would trickle down to Finland - this assuming that Finnish banking institutions were not directly affected to begin with.

Not that this should change the position of the Finns: just that they would have to be prepared to deal with some of the consequences, which I think is something they would be more than capable of doing.",0,1302975981,null,0,false,0,c1pqo90,t3_graoa,t1_c1pqo90,t1_c1pq4mm,1427072545,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"well, I thought 'joint criminal enterprise' was basically an euphemism for 'conspiracy'; I doubt this word would have created any better reactions...

Just to make it more explicit, though you warn that you're agreeing this is the case - the judgment is perfectly clear on what was contested, and mere military action clearly wasn't :

&gt;""The crimes alleged by the Prosecution include deportation and forcible transfer, plunder of public or private property, wanton destruction, murder, inhumane acts and cruel treatment. The crimes alleged further
include persecution, including through unlawful attacks on civilians and civilian objects, unlawful detentions, and the imposition of restrictive and discriminatory measures.""

in no way is this about the military operations, but about the treatment of civilians, and that's a crime whoever does it, and it states this explicitly:

&gt;The Chamber notes that the events in this case took place in the context of many
years of tension between Serbs and Croats in the Krajina. In this regard, the Parties agreed
that a considerable number of crimes had been committed against Croats in the Krajina.
The events in this case also took place in the context of an armed conflict in the territory of
the former Yugoslavia that had been ongoing for years. However, this case was not about
crimes happening before the Indictment period. _Nor_ _was_ _it_ _about_ _the_ _lawfulness_ _of_ _resorting_
_to_ _and_ _conducting_ _war_ _as_ _such_. _This_ _case_ _was_ _about_ _whether_ _Serb_ _civilians_ in the Krajina
were the targets of crimes, and whether the Accused should be held criminally liable for
these crimes.

The level of manipulation with facts in public is evident even in this simple case. (Another prominent is the sentence ""...inflict such blows that the Serbs will [for] all practical purposes disappear"" from the Brioni transcript, claiming the court took this to mean cleanse the civilian population - which the verdict explicitly rejects and interprets this as referring to the military)


And fairly frequent occurrences of these acts under Gotovina's etc effective command are documented on 800 pages of the verdict, yet he basically did nothing, to either punish or prevent them. 

The whole thing doesn't look frivolous at all; having read the brijuni transcripts as well as the court's analysis of it, and skimming the material evidence part, while I couldn't say where the balance of evidence lies or if the punishment is proportionate, since IANAL, it nevertheless is IMO the case that the guys could very well have been guilty, as the court ruled. Tuđmans statements there, enthusiastically accepted by Gotovina sound pretty damning, and suggest to my ear at least, a joint criminal enterprise to ethnically cleanse the Serb population from Krajna, as was done.

I'm mostly concerned that according to the polls from yesterday, 95% is SURE the verdict is unjust? Based on what? The nation has gone insane, IMO... I do understand being in such minority, I'll have to spend a decent amount of time reviewing the trial.

Everything was much better in the 1950s. Therefore, we should get back to how things were then.""

*Most likely voted by:* Grumpy old men, everybody's grandpas, unemployed youth, current and former neo-nazis.


**The party: Kokoomus (""the national coalition party"")**

*How a typical supporter thinks:* ""Money talks. Let's not tax the rich so much, the poor are poor only because they're lazy/stupid/incompetent. I am rich/well-paid/handsome/intelligent/good-looking/healthy/been lucky in life in general (or I intend to be some of those in the near future), therefore I deserve better. I don't deserve to be paying for the welfare of drug addicts, I've got my own kids to feed. 

Those young hippies of today should get in line, put a suit on and step on a proper career path. Also, military and religion FTW. 

C.G.E. Mannerheim was a god, everyone who points out that he was probably gay should be hanged for treason. 

People tell me I have no heart, but that's not true. I do, it's just black and doesn't beat.""

*Most likely voted by:* CEOs, soldiers, engineers, retired nurses, economists


**The party: Keskusta (""the centre party"")**

*How a typical supporter thinks:* ""Time to plant mi potatoes. I wonder how the cows are doing in the barn. Those young city-hippies 
should be taught a lesson, they have no manners! I'm voting centre, as I did also go to the military, belong to the church, and listen to Finnish tango too, after all those all are the things you're supposed to do, right? 

People living in Helsinki are arrogant bastards. We should take all their offices and move them to remote Lapland, so we can keep the Finnish countryside occupied. That'll teach them! I'm sure they won't mind selling their houses, uprooting their families, and leaving their friends behind - after all, life is much better in the countryside, when there's 300km to the nearest grocery store.""

*Most likely voted by:* Farmers, former farmers, wives of farmers, children of farmers (those that haven't moved to Helsinki yet), people from Lapland (if those do, indeed, exist).


**The party: SDP (""social democrats"")**

*How a typical supporter thinks:* ""My boss probably votes for the coalition party, and that makes him evil. I would vote for them too, 
but I didn't get that promotion yet, so I think I'll vote for the one major party that wants to tax him, and our firm more. That'll teach him! 
I admire entrepreneurs for the risks they take, but I don't want any of them to earn one cent more than me, since that would be so unfair. I generally like the society to be ""fair"" and ""just"", and by that I mean my conception of fair and just should be accepted by everyone. I'm for immigration, until firms start to hire foreigners in MY profession who compete for jobs with ME - then I suddenly want to close the borders immediately. 

I want the welfare state to continue, but don't want to think about where the money needed will come from. I'm not really leftist, though, so it's good that the party is not really, either.""

*Most likely voted by:* plumbers, factory workers, non-promoted office workers, former hippies, people approaching retirement age, people who want to avoid having strong opinions about anything (SDP used to be the largest party in Finland, surprisingly enough...)


**The Party: Vihreät (""the greens"")**

*How a typical supporter thinks:* ""Multinational corporations are evil. Nationalism is evil. Military is evil. Multiculturality is good. Humanitarian immigration from islamic countries is good. Modern art is good. Gays, lesbians and abortion are good. The world is doomed, unless we stop living and breathing immediately. Also, peace &amp; cannabis for everyone!""

*Most likely voted by:* Vegans, philosophers, artists -in other words: those damn hippies. Generally, people who are the total opposite of those voting for the True Finns.


**The Party: Vasemmistoliitto (""the leftist alliance"")**

*How a typical supporter thinks:* ""The world is screwed over by the corporations, capitalism and the rich people. Viva la revolucion, Karl Marx FTW!""

*Most likely voted by:* unemployed artists, recently laid-off people, philosophy students, former communists, voters who wish the Soviet Union still existed so Finland could join.


...And then there are those few smaller parties, who usually have a member or three in the parliament...such as RKP (the Swedish people) 
and the KD (the Jesus people). Additionally, everybody is free, of course, to give their vote away to a small party with no hopes of 
getting a representative, parties such as:


**The Party: Piraattipuolue (""the pirates"")**

*How a typical supporter thinks:* ""The most important thing in the world is to legalize downloading movies and games from the Internet. I'm sure, after doing that, we'll have time to think about lesser things, such as the economy, unemployment, human rights and all that. Of course, as a party, we have no opinion on those, only the more important stuff, like having the right to go and get that latest Pokemon movie from Pirate Bay.""

*Most likely voted by:* first-year university students, people sued for copyright infringement, everyone under 20.


In the end, though, these party differences won't matter much, as no matter which parties form the new government, nothing much is likely to change.
