Globalism. I don't really see that hurting cultures, either. It might enforce human rights and peace which, generally, is a good thing. It'd surely be a problem if such people as the NPD would be the ones enforcing stuff.

Americanism, well. Burger King and McDonalds have no chance against Döner outlets, Walmart failed epicly on the German market, and I wouldn't know about pop culture. Generally, I'd say that the USA were more popular in the past than now.


Internationalism is a topic, but I don't see Germany loosing its sovereignty. Germanism is a more acute topic, as I'm a separatist (though not anti-EU).

As to the economic take on all this, I'd say it's too early to say. There seems to be both opposition against planned economies and shark-pool capitalism worldwide, so stuff isn't as bad as paranoids may believe.

Thanks a lot, but then I have a dilemma: should I watch that Hungarian drama or that other Finnish comedy (pun, well... intended :p)?

Understanding the nuances has little to do with knowing the corresponding words (or the lack of) and everything to do with the local ethos. One should study a people's culture and history of ideas, dive deep into their literature and even their history that shaped their way of thinking, and still not grasp the very 100%.

Right-wing culture is a muddled pseudo-ideology consisting of willful ignorance, poverty, and a desire to belong - think of it like archconservative American Republicans and their anti-abortion, anti-global warming, anti-gay marriage rantings.  It feeds on poverty and a fear of the ""other"" -- again, something that the U.S. is all too familiar with (Nativist movement, Know-Nothings, KKK, John Birch Society.) 

""Globalization"" has nothing to do with this, beyond the fact that, instead of forcing the new Eastern German states to go through some sharp pain and then pick up their economic shit after decades of broken socialist central planning, the German federal government pumped billions upon billions into trying to stimulate some sort of economic well-being, thus only prolonging the misery.  That led to unemployment, economic stagnation, and resulting xenophobia and anger.

The main reason why groups like the NPD (which IMHO are far further out there than groups like the Dutch PVV, Austrian FPÖ, or even the French FN) is that they have succeeded in cloaking themselves in a thin veneer of respectability, and German politics are too polite to call them out for the insane bullshit-artists that they are.

Good Evening,

Today has come because 25 years ago 12 cinema professionals, in the middle of a crisis as grave as our current one, joined together in spite of their differences. I'd like to start this speech by thanking the founders of the academy. Not only them, but everyone who has presided over this institution. Vice presidents, directors, and the whole of the academy. We've brought ourselves here tonight to the Teatro Real to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Spanish Academy of Cinematic Arts and Sciences and the creation of the Goya awards. Many thanks to everyone.

It may appear that we come to today separately, with fundamentally different points of view. This is the result of each individual fighting for their convictions and nothing more, because in reality we are all in the same place. Which is the defense of cinema. For that, I'd like to congratulate and thank all here for moving forward together with agreement and even disagreement.

We are making much ado, but this time there's something. (No entendía)…behind a cloud of smoke that impedes seeing with clarity. But the discussion is not in vain nor is it frivolous nor hasty. We cannot forget that which is most important, the heart of the matter, we are part of a whole and we are nothing without that whole. A movie isn't a movie until somebody sits in front of a screen and watches it. The science of cinema is defined by two concepts: a screen, and the people who enjoy themselves. Without the public, it is meaningless. We can never forget that fact.

They say that I've provoked a crisis. ""Crisis"" in Greek means a process or a change and change is action. We are at a point of no return and it is the moment to act. There is no going back. Everything depends on the decisions we make today. Nothing that was true in the past is true today. The rules of the game have changed. 25 year ago, nobody could have imagined that something called ""internet"" would revolutionize the market for movies in this way. And for those that want to see movies, it isn't the only option to bring the public to theaters.",0,1297711518,null,0,false,0,c1grjr6,t3_fks0o,t1_c1grjr6,t1_c1gokre,1426916897,3,false,es,t5_22i2,3

The internet is not the future like some believe. The internet is now. The internet is the way to get closer to the world, of sharing entertainment and culture that is used by hundreds of millions of people. The internet is part of our lives and the new window that opens our minds to the world.

Web users don't appreciate it called as it is today. They are citizens. They are simply people. They are our public. These audiences we have lost don't go to the movies because it's on a computer screen. I want to say clearly that ""we're not afraid, internet"" because the internet is precisely the salvation of our cinema.

We will only succeed in the future if we ourselves can change and innovate, moving forward with imaginative and creative proposals. We must support a new market model that takes into account everyone involved: authors, producers, distributers, theaters, web pages, servers and users.

A crisis and a change is needed to advance toward a new understand of the business of film. We must think of our rights, of course, but never forget our obligations. We have a moral obligation to the public. We cannot forget an essential, we make movies because they permit us to and we should thank and respect them.

The films we are speaking of tonight are the proof that in this country (Spain), we work tirelessly. However the same effort, or more has been put into the films that have not come here tonight as nominees. They also warrant being here because they've worked just as hard as us, or more. 

I want to bid farewell in my final gala as president by reminding all the Goya nominees just one thing. What does it matter if we win or lose if we're able to make movies and work doing what we enjoy the most? There is nothing better than feeling liberated creating and sharing happiness with others. We are film makers, we tell stories, we create worlds that audiences live in. We are more than 30,000 people that have the immense luck of living to manufacture dreams. We have to be at the high level that society offers us.

I believe, with complete humility, that if we want people to respect us, we must give respect first.

Finally, I'd like to say that the next president of the academy is someone I'm very fond of. I don't know who it will be, but I already love him. These have been the two happiest years of my life. I've met marvelous people from all sectors of the industry. I've seen problems from new points of view. They have enriched me and made me better than I was. I've demonstrated that working along with others is an extraordinary experience, but it's very had to start.

To finish, above all and most importantly, 25 very good years have gone by but we are left with many more. Surely they will be the best.

It helps if you have some kind of a football team, or some nuclear weapons, but at the very least you need a beer._  There's a lot of beer in Europe already, so that doesn't work as a practical criterion, so I think we're going to have to settle for the former.

Of course it's an arbitrary distinction.  I thought the idea was to find exactly that, to avoid giving Upper Slobovia a comment flag because some angsty teenager is still trying to work out his sense of national identity.

&gt; there was no legal way to secede from the EU, and EU treaties in some instances superseded national parliamentary sovereignty.

The EU does not have final legal say over whether a country wishes to be a member or not, and never has, Lisbon or not.  Member countries, through accession to the treaty, give the EU authority to impose rules through the European parliament or the Court of Justice with which national legislation must be brought into sync as a condition of the state's adherence.  The EU has no enforcement mechanism, aside from penalties or sanctions.  It is a treaty organization, not a sovereign state.

Yes, and none of them have a potable beer.  Then again, neither does France, and they still let it come to parties.

Most people should speak english, especially in areas which are used to tourists just ask if someone speaks english and if the waiter isn't someone else will and they will get some other waiter for you. Asking in english is ok too, you could have some problems reading the menue but most times they should have a menue in english they can give you instead of the german one if english is not already used next to the german one.

What you should also know: There are no free refills. If you order one coke, and you order another one you have to pay for both of them. Also Water is never tabwater but always from the bottle. 

Also at the entrance door of most restaurants are sticker which indicate what payment methods are available. So you can see straight away if you can use a credit card, but Germany is a cash based country so I'm encouraging having some cash with you just to be safe. If you get money at an ATM they don't display yet what this Bank will charge you to get money so be carefull not that you get home and have a huge amount of fees to pay.

* It has a different language to the host state

But for Mexico, this is not the issue at all.

Simply thinking about it fosters impunity in a nation already riddled with corruption. Do you think that, given Mexico's current state, it can afford to look weak and unjust?

I think that the French are too fast to support Cassez, because they are too quick to forget her victims, and it's too easy to ignore Mexico's circumsances. This is a 14 year old democracy.

Well, have you been following our politics lately? Our non-environment-friendly-israeli-kissing-ass-not-giving-a-damn-about-journalists-freedom quite sucks right now.

Edit: Here is a list of what has been done in the past 4 years with a conservative minority government:

* Refusing to ratify Kyoto's treaty
* Our PM said to a journalist that he was for the death penalty, in certain case
* Even though we are also having hard times, they decided to order 15 (at least) billion worth of the new F35 (The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II), without any call for tenders.
* Our government currently has its hands in a torture scandal with Afghanistan prisoners. 
* There is almost no journalistic freedom within the government. Everything has to go through the PM office before being given to a journalist
* They have prorogated the parliament (proroger le parlement) twice, while it has never been done this way before.

true,[deleted],null,null,"First of all, questions: What major are you in? Male or Female? How old? Where are you going to live (dorm, shared appartment, own appartment)?

General rule: If you don't understand something, just ask. People will know you're american and will assume that you're different ;)

It's considered rude to talk to someone while chewing gum. In private conversations, it's mostly a nuisance but in a professional setting it's a no-go. (That's a thing I noticed US Students like to do)

Same goes for texting and listening to musik on headphones while talking to someone.

Nobody wears a hat/cap indoors (ok, a few people do). In a professional setting, it's again a no-go.

In University, most people are more or less fluent in english. They will speak english to you if they know you're American. If you want them to speak german (so you learn the language), just ask them. You can also work out a deal that you talk English to them and they respond in German if you like.

Read [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany#History). It'll give you enough information so you don't embarras yourself asking ""stupid american"" questions. If you've read that, you can ask pretty much everything and I guess most people would be happy to answer.

It's customary to take of your shoes in an appartment. When in doubt, ask or just take them off. The host will tell you if you don't have to.

It's common to have friends of the opposite sex without any sexual interest. If a girl/guy likes to hang out with you doesn't mean she's into you.

If you live in a dorm, the pro-tip to get to know people is to leave your door open and/or to hang out in the kitchen. Cooking a ""welcome dinner"" with american food is usually greatly appreciated. Just ask or hang up a sign-up sheet at the door where people pass by. (if it's something more expensive you can also ask people to chip in a couple of Euros)

When eating out, it's customary that you pay what you had. You might get asked ""Zusammen oder Getrennt"" (together or separate). If you unsure (eating out with a friend and his/her family), just wait a split second and get you wallet out. If you're invited, you'll get a ""Ich mach das"" (I'll take it) or somthing from whoever is paying.

Rule of thumb for tipping: &lt;5 Euro, round up. 5-10, round up, add 0.5-1 Euro if it feels too little (9E bill would be 10, a 9.50 bill could be eihter 10 or 11). Everything above 10, tip between 5 and 15%. Try to reach ""nice"" numbers (basically everything with a 5 or a 0 at the end). Low tipping is usually accepted, so adjust it for the service you got.

When going to a private party, bring something. Bottle of liquor, 6pack of beer, whatever. (Drinking age for beer/wine in Germany is 16, hard Liquor is 18. Pretty much everyone will be accustomed to drinking)

Most German households separate their trash and some people (including me) are pretty stingy about it. If you see several bins and it's not clear what they're for, ask someone how the system works. Usually people separate: Green Glass, White Glass, Brown Glass, Paper/Cardboard, Biodegradable stuff (""Kompost"" or ""Biomuell""), Packaging (like the omnipresent Tetra-pack etc.) and the trash that's left (""Restmuell"").

If you're a man: Unless it's a pissoir or a designated ""Stehklo"" (standing toilet) Sit down for peeing for gods sake. Also no peeing in a shared shower. Both will get your ass kicked in a serious fashion.

If you say ""We need to hang out soon"" or ""Give me a call"", expect Germans to take your word for it. If a German is friendly, (s)he usually means it and expects the same. So if someone invites you to come over for a beer or something, that's usually a real invitation.

Be on time. If it's 5, it's 5. Try being there a couple of minutes earlier. People get pissy if you're more than 5 minutes late, especially if it involves dinner or something. If you know you'll be running late for more than a couple of minutes, call them. This does not apply to a party. 

Not Embarrasment related tip but may be crucial:

Also watch out for the exam period. In a lot of Uni courses in Germany there's only one final exam that counts 100% of your grade. If you are taking courses designed for undegrads (&lt;6th semester in Germany or Vordiplom/Bachelor), the exams might be rather hard (especially to get good grades, i.e. over C+).
If attendance is optional, you don't have homework/papers/whatever, you might underestimate the time you have to study for one of those exams.

edit: I'm hungry, going to get something to eat now. Will continue later.

edit2:

Also when eating out, be aware that there are usually no refills. If you order a coffee, that's one (1) cup of coffee. Also, eating out is usually a lot more expensive than in the US, so people cook a lot more.

Dining halls are usually open during the week only and often have only lunch. Be prepared to cook.

People usually eat warm only 1-2 times a day. Usually lunch is warm and dinner is bread with cheese/sausage/... (""Abendbrot""), even though that shifts quite often for students. However, you usually only eat out for dinner, which is then warm of course.

When buying beer, go for brand's you've never heard of (so avoid Beck's for example). They're still good, but most German towns have pretty awesome microbreweries that taste quite different and awesome (and are usually cheaper).

If you travel, don't do a ""2 days per city"" eurotrip. It's just sad if you rush through a city like Berlin, Rome, Paris or London. Also, you'll be pretty close to Berlin. Go there for at least a weekend. Go see the ""Deutsches Historisches Museum"".

As for the substance of your post, most Canadians have no idea what equalization payments really are from a policy perspective.  Given the way the media frame it, most Canadians who didn't study these incredibly complex policy fixes at the graduate level (as I did) are under the mis-impression that equalization payments are payments made by the governments of Alberta and other ""have"" provinces directly to Quebec and other have-not provinces when they're nothing of the sort.  Furthermore, equalization payments have nothing to do with GDP, they have everything to do with GDP per capita.

I find it oddly funny how some people always rag on just Quebec for receiving equalization payments.  The programme says nothing about Quebec specifically receiving the payments, Quebec just happens to qualify (along with a bunch of other provinces) based on standards that were independently set.  But the fact that Quebec is the only province that gets to be the shit magnet shows a real bigotry on the part of people who bitch about it receiving equalization payments, in my opinion.  The real test of whether these arguments are hypocritical or not will come when people who bitch about Quebec receiving equalization payments start spending at least 1/100th the same energy bitching about Newfoundland or PEI or New Brunswick or BC or Manitoba or Ontario receiving equalization payments.  I noticed none of those provinces drew your ire or clichéd simplistic reductions of their people in all their complexity.  

As for Hydro profits, you're pissed about that?  Seriously?  That's pretty weak.  Are you also pissed at Hydro One for making strong profits off nuclear energy or BC making strong profits off selling pot?

The fact of the matter is that your argument as articulated above, is based on a cliché that seeks to reduce a whole complex population down to a caricature that has no relationship to reality.  You've presented a standard cliché and three ""arguments"" for it (actually, none of those were arguments, there were just assertions, but I digress) and every one of them wouldn't hold up in even a first year poli sci paper.

**Rock and Pop**:

- Dungen — Swedish Classic/Progressive Rock
- Контрол (Kontrol) — Bulgarian Punk Metal
- Ахат (Ahat) — Bulgarian Classic Metal
- Element of Crime — German Chanson (sounds strange, but is actually awesome)
- Rammstein — That was obvious, no?
- Amadou and Mariam — Reggae by a blind couple from Mali (lyrics in French, Spanish and some northern African language)


**Classical**

- Osvaldo Golijov
- Iva Bittová — Mesmerizing Czech performer, amazing voice &amp; violin play, intricate arrangements
- Vladimir Godar — Has an amazing album with Bittová
- Le Mystère Des Voix Bulgares (also Bulgarian State Radio and Television Female Vocal Choir) — Traditional Bulgarian female voices in classical arrangements
- The Bulgarian Voices Angelite (Ангелите) — Also traditional Bulgarian music, leaning more towards Orthodox church music
- Angelite &amp; Huun-Huur-Tu — Have 2 albums together that give me the chills every time I *think* about them. One is also with ""Moscow Arts Trio."" Huun-Huur-Tu are worth listening to if you like Tuvan throat singing. You probably don't know if you like Tuvan throat singing.
- Aziza Mustafa Zadeh — Armenian pianist and singer. Amazing, if you're into classical and operetta style singing. Even if you aren't her piano is gorgeous. 
- Yungchen Lhamo — Tibetan chants. Her first album is really the only good one, the rest is too westernized for my taste. The first one, however is enchanting.
- Omar Faruk Tekbilek (Ömer Faruk Tekbilek) — Traditional Turkish music. Again, the right word is enchanting, but in a very different way. Really awesome. 

**Folk**

- Goran Bregović (Горан Бреговић) — Bosnia and Herzigovina
- Emir Kusturica (Емир Немања Кустурица) — Serbia/Yugoslavia
- Gjallarhorn — Swedish mystical folk with astoundingly good performers
- Garmarna — Swedish folk/electronics crossover
- Hedningarna — Simple but fun Swedish Folk
- Tenhi — Melancholic Finnish folk
- Värttinä — Sophisticated Finnish folk
- Dikanda — Amazing live group from Poland, also perform Macedonian folk and other stuff
- Irfan — Bulgarian musicians that perform mostly oriental folklore. Amazing group, especially their second album is fantastic.
- Isihia (Исихия) — Bulgarian group performing traditional music with synth walls and some Turkish influences. Their album ""Orisia"" (Орисия) is one of my favorite albums ever
- Stellamara — Mixture of several flavors of oriental music. Available for free at magnatune.
- Dhafer Youssef — Oriental music. Prominent Oud, awesome chants, some electronic crossover
- Ale Möller Band — Swedish based international gypsy music. Sounds crazy, is crazy, but good!
- Azam Ali, Vas — Oriental music, with beautiful vocals. I prefer Vas, Azam Ali is the singer of Vas, who has some solo albums, but they're not all that good.
- Falik — Incredibly fun Oriental feel-good folk. Avaliable for free at magnatune.
- Ulver — Norwegian Black Metal band, but they have a couple of folk albums that are amazing.
- Clan an Drumma — No vocals, but awesome Scottish pipes and drums
- Kent Masalı — You probably won't be able to get their music. They're a local Germany-based band with a Turkish singer. They perform an awesome mix of Turkish and electronic music. Send me a PM and I'll send you some samples. You can (should!) buy their CD from their website :-)
- Panacea — America-based folk band who mostly specialize in Balkan music. Available for free at magnatune
- Буготак (Bugotak) — Remember Tuvan throat singing? This is from Russia, and it's very crazy. He's got an album where he does misheard-lyrics style covers of several popular American songs. Lyrics are, of course, Russian.
- Madredeus — Apparently this *isn't* Fado. But it's still awesome Portuguese music!
- Luar na Lubre — Celtic folk

I've also not included instrumental artists. I love a lot of international Jazz, but that's usually instrumental. I can add it, if you'd like.

You should check magnatune.com and maybe jamendo.com for their folk and classical sections. It's a treasure trove, but it'll take you some time to filter through it.

You know what else begins with rounding up people? Elections, schools, hospitals, flood relief, football games, etc. If being agitated on the internet is a means in its own end for you, then fine, be agitated for the sake of it, but don't assume that your antics are shared with anyone.

&gt; And... national purity, for god sake choose better word... you are not helping yourself

""National purity"" (in its different variations amongst the languages of the world) is explicitly used by the crazy people I referred to - call them racists, fascists, Nazis, ethnic supremacists or whatever you want (look carefully and you'll see that I explicitly called it a ""delusional dream""). If you still did not get it, maybe a little help will bolster your reading comprehension: There are the French, a subset of human individuals. And then there are the crazy French, another subset that shares some individuals with the French set. Now you might find it curious that I implied to gather the crazy in some place when it's the crazies' desire to do that to other people to keep their turf free from those other people, but that was the point of that fucking joke. Moreover, they might even embrace it for the sake of being around what they perceive as their kind, no matter if that kind would rather not be around the crazy.

&gt; And about our low density of population, it have a reason

Whatever. If there was a colony in outer space with a Martian speaking populace, I'd imply to send their crazies there too, just for shits and giggles. Right at that point I would not care if oxygen supplies would only last for an hour, because, guess what: I do not desire forced displacement for anyone.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well actually, you would if you're friends.
Basically I know of three major routes towards dating:

1. Good friends take it one step further
2. Casual Dating
3. Post-making out dating

No 1 is rather complicated (you've probably seen the front-page posts concerning this topic) but sometimes it works and the relationships I know that have come from this are rather stable and cool (mostly because you know each other darn well before you start dating).

No 2 is the classical approach of dating. Chatting someone up, have a nice conversation, decide to meet another day...

No 3 happens if you're at a party, usually drunk and for some reason start to make out with someone and decide that it wasn't a bad idea. If you survive the awkward day after and still like each other, you're either having an affair or you're dating.

I guess what makes dating a lot harder is that the friend-zone is a lot bigger, especially in terms of body contact. If you're good friends with a girl it can definitely happen that she cuddles with you/sits on your lap/gives you the occasional smooch on the cheek/talks about sex with you without being romantically interested. (which is kinda cool if you like that but aren't interested either) Oh and btw. a foot massage is often still in the friend-zone (despite Pulp Fiction).
A good indicator is how fast these things happen. If you don't really know a girl well (friend of a friend or something like that) and she starts getting rather physical, that may be a sign that you're in the dating zone.

Another one would be how that person behaves/dresses if (s)he knows you'll be around (usually useful for women). If (s)he really makes an effort to look presentable and not to say stupid things, that's an indicator.

Also look for the situation in which what you may perceive as ""hints"" appear. In the haunted-house it's because she's scared. However, if she sticks closer than usual to you when she's relaxed again, that might be a real hint.

Another thing that might be different from the US: Girls are often a lot less i-wanna-be-a-princess-ish. However, the usual want to be desired is still persistent in I'd say 90%. Means, the guy has to call on the next day (or whenever). She won't even if she has the most massive crush, just because she want's to be the one in control. Stupid, but that's the way it usually is.

Disclaimer: It might just be that I hang around with a lot of weird and very cool girls. Or that women are swarming me and I'm incredibly dense.

Appendix: Some thing's that can (but some are rather... rare) be in the friend-zone in Germany (some from personal experience, other as seen):
A kiss (more like a smooch but mouth to mouth), cuddling, napping in one bed, walking around in underwear, talk about sex and everything, really close dancing, massage (foot and back), close hugging, going on vacation together (just the two),...

Disclaimer no 2: Which one of these are accepted if one is taken (that is, accepted by the non-involved partner) is questionable. Usually a lot less. And people talk.

Final note: From what I've seen so far is that *usually* (at least in student circles), having a lot of sexual partners is rather unusual, as is sex on the first date (especially if no alcohol is involved).

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ok, since you'll live in a 2 person household with a girl, here's a couple of further tips that are more important in such a close environment:

1. Clean up after you. Do the dishes, leave the toilet clean, wipe the table if you've spilled something, you know the drill. There will most likely be a system of who cleans the shared areas (bath, kitchen, ...)/takes out the trash and when. If she doesn't tell you, ask. Girls are usually a lot more picky about cleanliness in common areas.

2. Figure out how they share things. Sometimes everyone has their own dishes and everything. More often people share their dishes, pots and stuff like flour, salt, beer ... (you usually chip in for buying those or buy them once in a while)

3. Usual greeting for girls you do not know is shaking hands. If you know them better, hug. When in doubt, nothing (or go for the hug like a boss).

4. Be attractive. just kidding, just shower/brush your teeth, wash your clothes. It's sad that this needs to be said but experience with some exchange and domestic students has proven that sometimes it's an issue (russia and argentinia, I'm looking at you &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;)

5. If she doesn't introduce herself when you move in, say hi and introduce you if she's there (unless it's in the middle of the night) or the next time you see her.

6. It's not as common that friends introduce their friends to other people. Sometimes people do it, more often you just shake hands and say your name (if it's a lot of people, the name just once in a while, ""hi"" or something for the rest, otherwise it's awkward)

edit: Couple of more things

7. If you're lacking an ingredient for a dish and you know she has some, usually it's fine to just ask if you can have some. If she's not there to ask and you really have to use it, make sure to leave a note or tell her asap and replace what you've taken if it makes sense (if you take half a liter of milk, buy her a new carton).
This does not neccessarily apply to stuff like sweets, finished food, specialties. People can get pissed off if they had a piece of pizza in the fridge and come home really hungry and the roommate ate it. 

8. Be prepared to not have access to a car, most students don't have one. Public transportation is awesome though in Germany so you need not be worried. You might want to get a bike as it is the primary way for students to get around.

9. You'll almost certainly not have airconditioning, which is pretty uncommon in Germany (except for in commercial buildings). As you are there for the summer, it might be relevant.  (T-)Shirt, Shorts and Flipflops are cool for Uni. Never Sandals+Socks. If it's really retardedly hot, ask the girl if she minds if you walk around topless. Usualy it's cool with everyone. (if you're hot, do it anyway. A lot of US students are more gym-happy than Germans so she might appreciate).

10. Dresscode (not really, just so you don't look awkward):
* Sweatpants/Tracksuits/Jerseys/Running Shoes: Unless you are going to/coming from sport or you're at home (i.e. not when you've got someone over), don't wear them. NOT in public/uni/whatever. US Students like their sweatpants a lot, in Germany they're a lot rarer. Unless you're going to a game or Germany is playing soccer, nobody's wearing a jersey (except maybe for sports) And running shoes are for running, not for wearing instead of sneakers.
* Going out: For guys it's long pants with no sidepockets. Jeans are ok. Shoes is nice sneakers or leather (less common but totally ok), definitely closed toe. (T-)-Shirt needs to have sleeves.
* Outside (for a BBQ, going to the park): Free for all! Shorts, sandals (not so much but are ok in this situation), flipflots, any kind of shirt. No sweatpants (seriously)
* University: Depends on the temperature. The hotter it is, the more relaxed the ""dresscode"". Pretty much everything is ok, except for the usual (tracksuits, sweatpants, jerseys, sandals). Observe your fellow students. Jeans, sneakers and a (t-/polo-)shirt are always appropriate. In the summer, exchange jeans for shorts if you want and sneakers for flipflops.
* Everywhere else: See University.

!!! THIS ONE IS IMPORTANT (can't believe I almost forgot it): 

11. Adressing people: German has two (major) ways of addressing people, i.e. saying ""you"". The informal ""Du""+First name and the formal ""Sie""+(Herr/Frau + Title) Last name (capital S, always). Pretty much everyone under 18 is ok with being ""Du"", over 18 it starts to get tricky. If it's an informal relationship (friends) it's a ""du"", same goes for students in general. Everyone else (everything professional) it's ""Sie"". Age is also a good indicator. Young people are ""du"" (under 18 it's always ""du""), middle aged/old people are ""Sie"". When in doubt, use ""Sie"".
When somebody introduces themselves with first name ONLY, it's usually ""Du"". Other than that, the older one/senior one has to offer the ""Du"", which he either does by switching from ""Sie"" to ""Du"" when adressing you or introducing himself with First name ONLY (""Hallo, ich bin Peter, der CEO""). In a private environment (for example when visiting a family), it's customary to ""Sie"" (the verb is sietzen) the parents unless they offer the ""du"" EVEN if they use ""du"" to adress you.

Another thing that is different from the US that in a University setting, non-students (so that doesn't apply to student TAs) are adressed and referred to with ""Sie"" and Last name. Also, people tend to be proud of their titles (""von"" in the last name, ""Dr."" or ""Prof.""). In written communication, always use them. When talking about them to others, also use them.  When talking directly to them it might be different (observe fellow students) but when in doubt, use the title.
tl;dr: When in doubt, use Sie, Herr/Frau + Last name and titles.",0,1298144844,null,0,true,0,c1hgw40,t3_fo5nn,t1_c1hgw40,t1_c1hgkto,1426929149,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3

One great example is health care. In Canada, the provinces handle it. In the US, they created a giant federal bureaucracy. Even US liberals are confused because they are blind federalists. They want to be like Canada, right? Yet the idea of *states* running their health care like the provinces do in Canada was a non-starter.

If Quebec does not want to support military action in a certain instance, like Afghanistan, they should not send anyone.

Racism and Antisemitism is in Germany (omg who would have guessed) a touchy subject (the more public the conversation, the more silence you will get). It's generally handled very open (go see the Museum in Berlin) and honest and most people are willing and able to talk about it, but it's something you have to be careful to make jokes about. As an American you sortof got a get-out-of-jail card but it's a damn sure way to kill of a conversation to make a remark that's not really funny. Of course you can ask people about racism/antisemitism in Germany, that's something different., you'll most likely get well thought out answers.

Germany's a social democracy. We've got universal healthcare, unemployment benefits that do not run out, unions everywhere, no tuition in the Unis etc. What in the US is left-wing is center or center right in Germany. Also it's rather liberal with gay-almost-marriage, low age of consent, low drinking age, legal prostitution, ... Just not guns or weed, they're still illegal to have.
Don't be surprised if people are baffled of how things are handled (best example: tuition) in the US.

Having a pan-national parliament dictating laws on individuals is the wrong way of doing it. Let the town or city decide how their inhabitants live, and give people the right to move away from towns they dislike to towns they like.
