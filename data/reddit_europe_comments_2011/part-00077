On the other side, rightwings are often immediately accused of killing any non-german people, after it comes out, that it weren't right wings, the case isn't mentioned anymore by the media.

He was pretty loose with a few facts and fairly manipulative, but then he is a politician.

His politics are very populist and pretty libertarian. But he's the leader of what is still a pretty small party in the UK, and he can afford to be more populist than most. He is, as you say, ""mouthy"". I think he likes to give off the air of not suffering fools gladly, and most of the videos I've seen have been of him attacking van Rompuy, Catherine Ashton, and Donald Tusk in the EP.

Meanwhile in England they secured 866,633 votes and in Wales 35,690 votes - *presumably incomers from England* (3.5% and 2.4% respectively).

The party stems from a particular section of English society's dislike of Johnny Foreigner telling them what to do as that is England's job (telling other people what to do). Now that they only have the Welsh, Northern Irish and Scots to boss about, the English will be damned if some swarthy skinned foreign sounding types are going to boss them about - *that's America's job*.

The party's position vis-a-vis our devolved assemblies seems to be a bit confused (though I suppose it makes perfect sense to them). They don't like them and would like to have them abolished - as with the EU - however they would also like an English Parliament set up.

I'm sure someone will be quick to shoot me down down though for being an uppity Scots git with ideas above my station.

And another point, this type of mocking doesn't go both ways.  Besides a few fringe right wing people, a lot of Americans perceive Europe in a very good light.  Many times more positively than what it actually is.

Fact is that US/Europe decided to do two different things with their time of economic growth.  US choose, security, domination in foreign affairs and leadership, while EU chose, social harmony, healthcare, and stable high paying workforces.  Neither entity can afford to do both, and neither choice is better than the other.  It could have easily gone the other way around and i wish people would get off their high horse once and for all.

Siempre puedes empezar con este puesto y trabajar ahi hasta que encuentres otra cosa mejor. Hay mucha gente fuera de trabajo y mucha gente que no se lo pensaria dos veces, todo depende de la prisa/necesidad que tengas en empezar a trabajar.

Criminals like the NUS are _not_ supported by the federal government or the member states. While it is true that various informants within the NPD are of, well lets say questionable worth and the whole system of using these informants for actually planning and executing neo-nazi demonstrations to get evidence to get certain key leaders to jail is wrong, there is not a shred of evidence that any of the members of the NSU or even its alleged supporters, who are until now are neither identified nor prosecuted, recieved any money from the agencies. 
And this may sound very hard for you and your conspiracy-loving head but even if that would be the case, this still would not mean that a goverment agency knowingly supported right-wing terrorists. 
All this goverment-bashing and conspiracy-thinking leads nowhere. As i have already stated, this form of right-wing attacks on immigrants is nothing new. We had the ""Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann"", we had the attack on the refugee house in Solingen in the early Ninenties and dozens of other attacks on immigrants and Germans by Nazis, some carried out by lone attackers or drunk groups, but there were a few cases where these things were actually planned by some form of organization, with a clear goal in mind.
And also, as a reminder, i am not downplaying this. Its a crime, its wrong and it should be dealt with. But if these people had not killed themselves for reasons unkown, no one would have known that these attacks were carried out by right-wing extremists. So again, i ask, whats the point? If you terrorize someone, you have to make it very clear who is terrorizing them, for what and for what reasons. Failing that, its a terrible crime, but not terrorism. So please, stop this hipocrisy, cool down and don't see enemies were there are none. ",0,1322095620,null,0,false,0,c32aomc,t3_mlqb7,t1_c32aomc,t1_c324j7z,1427921642,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

true,zekraut,null,null,"You're messing things up here. ""Handeln statt Reden"" does not refer to the modus operandi of right-wing terrorists. Its used by the more aggressive groups of the NPD, who adopted left-wing tactics at demonstrations (black clothing etc.) and refuse to work like a political party and more like a streetbattle organization, akin to the SA. While many of these people may be criminals and certainly a group that should be very closely monitored and, if possible, prosecuted they're not terrorists.

Its also not true that neo-nazis never proclaim responsibilty for their crimes. The members of the ""Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann/Ausland"" were very open about their goals and training, the attacks on immigrants in Moelln and Solingen were foreshadowed and followed by various calls to the police, fascist gatherings at night, bullying, verbal assaults and even physical attacks on immigrants. Hoyerswerda, Rostock, Muegeln, Magdeburg, all these attacks were carried out in the open. The ""Hochschulring Tuebinger Studenten"", was also very open about its willingness to use violence as a means to achieve its goals. 

And the RAF was not successful,yes, and it has nothing to do with how many, or how few, people they killed. What matters is, did they achieve their goals? No. Did they succeed in anything?

Out of all Europeans, the British (if we may call them that collectively and generalise across the different constituent countries) are the ones who probably feel the most culturally isolated. I think some of it has to do with the prevalence of monolingualism in modern times, but also the idea of English exceptionalism due to them being frontrunners in industrialisation and economic/democratic philosophy and a winner in WW2 (similar to the way French people can be nostalgic about their past, Napoleon's influence, etc). But most of all, I really think it's the language thing, not the loss of the empire thing.

British people simply don't speak other languages than English. A handful might be able to, of course, and many probably remember bits and pieces of French or German that they had to learn in school, but most are not able to communicate with other Europeans they meet apart from those Europeans who speak (heavily-accented) English. As a result, Brits identify with the people living in their former colonies instead (including Ireland) and they imagine cultural differences which aren't really there when they think about other Europeans. To some extent, other grossly monolingual European countries suffer from the same thing, but none are as monolingual as the UK so it tends to be the ""worst"". Brits have no problem fully opening up their borders to Irish people and did so many years ago, but are shit-scared of letting other Europeans in through Schengen. Why?

If you want to look at it scientifically, then sure, there are some cultural differences between European countries. One famous survey is the one conducted by Hofstede (his cultural dimensions) and it does indeed show that the culture of British people and people in former English colonies is relatively similar due to a shared history and shared cultural inheritance, however, Ireland doesn't always follow this trend and is not always consistently closer to British values than all the other European countries. In some respects, France and Belgium are more like British people, in other respects Italy or the Scandinavian countries are closer. British people in general just feel more at ease with other English-speakers - some English people even say that they are not Europeans and use ""European"" as a term to denote their non-English speaking neighbours rather than as an inclusive term for the whole of Europe.

I'm absolutely certain that if everyone spoke, say, French in the UK then their perspective on Europe and European integration would be totally different. The French would no longer be a strange culture across the pond, they would just be other Europeans like the themselves living directly south of the UK, their media would be totally accessible like many Europeans can access British media now and develop an understanding of British culture. And having that perspective as a UK citizen, it's also easier to imagine other European countries being closer to the values of the UK even if you don't speak their native language.

It is probably no coincidence that the ""core"" countries of the EU are the ones that are geographically quite central - Germany, France, Italy, etc.

I think your point about the colonies is very true. Britain grew apart from other European countries during the empire period, and is still seeing the effects of that.

One thing that I kind of disagree with though, is where you say brits are scared of letting other Europeans in though Shengen. Ok, UK is not part of Shengen, but Britain is one of the most ""open"" countries in the EU with regard to immigration. Uk was one of the very few countries to open its borders immediately to eastern european workers in 2004. Most countries waited several years, and Germany has only just opened them this year [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement_for_workers).

In fact, I think it could be argued that while the UK is isolated to some extent, it is one of the most outward-looking countries, which is a good thing. UK has a huge multicultural community and people are in general very tolerant of other cultures and races. This is much more so than many other European countries.

In answer to the OP's original question, the UK does not want to leave the EU at all, because it gains a huge amount in trade (the rest of the EU also benefits, of course). If current reports are anything to go by, it looks liek the EU could end up in a 2-tier system. In that case, Uk would end up in the outer tier, but would like to ensure that decisions made in the inner tier will not have damaging impacts. I also admit that there has been some shameful jockeying for position from some British politicians, who want to squeeze every last drop of benefits from the situation. Hopefully we can find a compromise that suits all.",0,1322127394,null,0,false,0,c32dz48,t3_mnmpi,t1_c32dz48,t1_c32djsq,1427923260,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14
true,Lams,FRAN,France,"My impression was that among the many many factors (and being an archipelago is probably one of the prime ones), the existence of the Commonwealth is an important one for two reasons.

For a start, this means that you're already part of an international community, where you share the language and some common values (your cultural love of your royalty, cricket and tea for instance). Europe adds potentially little here, as you can't really be part of a community that involves everyone. You gotta pick friends.

But more importantly, that also means that you can associate the behaviour of Brussels with the one of an imperialistic country, knowing first-hand that not all that comes of it will be good. Compare this with the debates we have in France or Belgium, were the ""consequences of colonisation"" are still considered in a mostly positive light. For us, being part of an empire (on the wrong side of the stick, of course) is a good thing. For you guys, it's less so.

But as I said, it really is a bunch of reasons, with a lot of them overlapping too.

true,specofdust,UKGB,United Kingdom,"This is a very good look at why the UK as a country is either opposed to EU membership or opposed to further integration. However I think that despite making a fantastic point, in order to get a real impression here, you need to look at the various reasons individual groupings of subcultures within the UK give.

For instance:

*The plebs*:

Much of this group hates the EU because they hear stories about how much it costs, read about bendy banana's being banned and water which claims to prevent dehydration being legally restricted, and ""unelected bureaucrats"" on the Brussels gravy train. The usual nonsense that we here make fun off, but they lap it up. This group is the reason we won't have a referendum.

*The old school tories*:

Queen and country and all that stuff you know? We beat the jerries and we're a great nation who, despite having no empire any more, is still really important in the world and is best placed to maintain our individual position of superiority and enact bilateral trade agreements with organisations like the US and EU, which we're not quite as important as, but almost.

*The nationalists*:

Keep the UK British, we don't want them roma gypo's and Bulgarian jews coming to our home and takin' our jobs, usin' our benefits and stealing our women, forcing the school teachers to speak Swahili and ensuring the NHS has to perform breast implants on 13 year old Slovakian girls so often that my old aunt Nora can't get that hip operation she's been waiting a few weeks for.

Right now, for instance, foreigners make up 11% of France population, compared to 7% in the UK. And this figure hides all the assimilation that has been going on in France too. For sure, we didn't have people from the West Indies coming in France, but just in the 20th century, we had people coming from Italy, Portugal or Poland and they're all very much french now, and were nicely accepted too.

So, what I'm trying to describe is not the fact that England or France or Germany has a different/better/worse history of accepting immigration.

The debate was very much a dichotomy between ""They're jobs that no-one else wants to do"" vs. the spectre of the Polish plumber. You just have to look to the headlines of *The Daily Mail* and *The Daily Express* to see the latter side of the debate. It's by no means received wisdom and immigration is always fairly high up on people's agendas in polling.

I think it's difficult to compare the French situation to the British one. We have our immigration debate, and we have fairly sizeable immigrant communities and descendants, but it just doesn't compare to France. We don't really have a far-right figure comparable to Jean-Marie le Pen, and we don't have a historic immigrant community comparable to the ~4,000,000 French North Africans. Our largest non-white ethnic group is British Indians (~1,000,0000), and I'd argue that they've assimilated and been adopted into British culture to an extent that French North Africans haven't. The debate about immigration is much more widespread in France because I'd argue it's perceived to be a bigger issue.

I'd also disagree with your comparison of the Romanian population in France with the situation of the Irish Travellers in the UK. I feel that while Irish Travellers are clearly on the receiving end of much criticism in the UK, they are still accepted as part of life here. The most extreme bigoted argument that I usually see is ""Why can't they buy a house?"" rather than ""Let's deport them back to Ireland."" The Irish Traveller community has been present in the UK for centuries now in some form or another.

I think much of it is to do with the different styles of government in the UK and France.

&gt; Except ... Kelly is correct. Pepper spray is basically habanero juice, according to Discovery News. And video viewers will note that Kelly very quickly adds that the composition of pepper spray ""is really beside the point"" and points out that the students were struck with something ""obviously invasive and obtrusive and several went to the hospital.""

&gt; As for the rest of the interview, Kelly, who is an attorney, appears to be evenhandedly informing the audience about the complex legal issues involved in the high-profile incident and even -- gasp! -- calls for more evidence before rushing to judgment.

&gt; ""Listen, I know the tape looks bad, I agree it looks bad, all I am saying is from a legal standpoint, I don't know that the cops did anything wrong. We're going to have to learn more about the facts.""

true,pretzpretz,UKGB,United Kingdom,"This is a very old fashioned view of Euroscepticism that I would have had some sympathy with pre-Lisbon Treaty.

Not entirely sure how you can accuse Britain of being the most 'anti-European' country in the EU given the fact that plenty of other countries in the EU have repeatedly expressed scepticism about the European project. Likewise I have no idea how exactly you are suggesting that there is a correlation between monolingualism and Euroscepticism.

The mostly multilingual Dutch and the less multilingual French rejected the Lisbon treaty when it was put to them in referenda. The Swedes, like us in Britain, opted out of the single currency. The Swedes are not exactly famous for their lack of foreign language abilities.

Norway and Iceland are not even in the EU, foreign language comprehension in those two countries far outstrips other countries that have traditionally been considered Europhile such as Spain and Italy.

Many British Eurosceptics have been, and continue to be, foreign language speakers. Enoch Powell spoke 12 languages and Daniel Hannan who is one of the most prominent Eurosceptics in Britain today is a fluent Spanish and French speaker.

In Britain itself, Scotland tends to be more pro-EU than England but I suspect that there is greater foreign language comprehension in England than in any of the other home nations.

For the record, I am a Briton who is becoming increasingly disillusioned by the EU because of its lack of respect for the will of the peoples of Europe. The fact that democratically elected European leaders are being replaced by more politically agreeable Technocrats is scary.

true,Lams,FRAN,France,"I'm not really comparing the French immigration situation with the British one (I wasn't even comparing to the British, but rather to the English one). For a start, the view about immigration/integration is quite subtle in France: the racism going on here is mostly against French youths of North-African or sub-sahel African descent. They are French. The main ""debate"" (if we can call it as such) is not about immigration, because they are here already (oh, and the ""they"" includes myself if you wanna know).

Moreover, the French do feel quite European, moreso than the British. And you will find a lot of French people with names sounding italian or polish.  So I think that in everyone's mind over here, Polish immigrants should be compared to the previous waves of european immigrations (same skin color, same religion, same values, and fairly well educated), rather then the actual problems of descendant of african immigration. 

This means that the problem is not about the lack of integration, the crime or the poverty but about jobs stealing and economy. And I will labout my point again: there IS a big difference as I said: the brits are more willing to accept foreigners to do jobs that no-one else will do. I've lived there, I've lived in France, I felt it very very much (and heck, we're the country that works 35H a week so that we can share even more the jobs across the population). 

Anyway, I'm not gonna spend my day arguing this point, I think it's a very minor one anyway. I was just trying to explain why I think the UK opened its borders to the new eastern european countries compared to the other western ones : more public acceptance.

This wasn't always the case. In the past, long time ago, media did use the word gypsy. It has only been recently that they started trying to invent what is the right terminology for things.

What makes it confusing, especially for English speaking people is that the English media use the term Roma.

I can see how English speaking people could confuse the two terms, but I don't think that Czech or Slovak people would confuse Romanians and Gypsies. It's even spelled and sounds quite differently - Romanians = Rumuni, Roma (Gypsies) = RÃ³movia. Romania = Rumunsko, so it's not easy to mistake.

I never said that they were the most anti-European country?

But, anyway, they're certainly the most anti-EU country. Take a look at the [latest Eurobarometer](http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb75/eb75_publ_en.pdf) or any number of years back and you will find that Brits are always rated as having the lowest overall opinion of the EU and always by a significant margin. The fact that the Dutch and French rejected the treaty does not mean that they are against the EU as a concept, it just means that they rejected the treaty for whatever reasons they might have had to reject it (internal politics, scared of a loss of sovereignty, institutionalising offical European symbols, etc.). The EU has serious image problems, no doubt about it, and people have legitimate gripes about the EU all around Europe, myself included. Still, I think it's safe to say the UK is consistently, statistically the most anti-EU country inside the union.

And my country, Denmark, also opted out of the Euro and, in fact, several other things which the UK _does_ participate in. That doesn't mean we as an aggregate are generally against the EU or European integration as a concept. It also doesn't mean that we accept all the other parts with no objections, the CAP for example has no friends here.

In England we have a method that for obtaining the least possible result at the greatest possible expenditure of time and money is perhaps unequalled. An English boy who has been through a good middle-class school in England can talk to a Frenchman, slowly and with difficulty, about female gardeners and aunts; conversation which, to a man possessed perhaps of neither, is liable to pall. Possibly, if he be a bright exception, he may be able to tell the time, or make a few guarded observations concerning the weather. No doubt he could repeat a goodly number of irregular verbs by heart; only, as a matter of fact, few foreigners care to listen to their own irregular verbs, recited by young Englishmen. Likewise he might be able to remember a choice selection of grotesquely involved French idioms, such as no modern Frenchman has ever heard or understands when he does hear.

[...]

&gt;I confine my remarks to French, because that is the only language we attempt to teach our youth. An English boy who could speak German would be looked down upon as unpatriotic. Why we waste time in teaching even French according to this method I have never been able to understand. A perfect unacquaintance with a language is respectable. But putting aside comic journalists and lady novelists, for whom it is a business necessity, this smattering of French which we are so proud to possess only serves to render us ridiculous.

&gt;In the German school the method is somewhat different. One hour every day is devoted to the same language. The idea is not to give the lad time between each lesson to forget what he learned at the last; the idea is for him to get on. There is no comic foreigner provided for his amusement.
The desired language is taught by a German school-master who knows it inside and out as thoroughly as he knows his own. Maybe this system does not provide the German youth with that perfection of foreign accent for which the British tourist is in every land remarkable, but it has other advantages. The boy does not call his master âfroggy,â or âsausage,â nor prepare for the French or English hour any exhibition of homely wit whatever. He just sits there, and for his own sake tries to learn that foreign tongue with as little trouble to everybody concerned as possible. When he has left school he can talk, not about penknives and gardeners and aunts merely, but about European politics, history, Shakespeare, or the musical glasses, according to the turn the conversation may take.

&gt;Left-wing-Groups are pretty much covered by politics
 
Yeah, windows of a few stores where smashed once in a while and some trains where delayed, which was interpreted as a wave of left wing terrorism and the dawn of a new RAF by Bosbach and other CDU members (They seem to be quite keen to exaggerate most dangers though, see the pointless ""warnings"" of terrorist attacks at this time last year - a warning is only useful if it allows people to react to it, without that it's just fear mongering.. maybe they're just paranoid and stuck in the mindset of the 70s when there still was left wing terrorism, who knows). Vandalism is shit, but a *long* way from terrorism, so I'm anything but wrong when I say that the police and conservative politicians vastly exaggerate the danger of left wing violence, while the fact that the numbers of right wing violence are systematically altered to look better in some cases (for which I have provided sources) - they still try to catch the guys, but they'd rather not admit that the violence was motivated by racism because that makes everyone look bad and it doesn't help local business. So the slogan when investigating these crimes is ""if possible, avoid detecting racist motivations that would make for unfavourable statistics"". 
 
&gt;after it comes out, that it weren't right wings, the case isn't mentioned anymore by the media.
 
Have you not noticed that these murders were huge stories even when people thought it was just immigrants murdering each other? Of course it's a bigger story now that they are connected with the murder of police officers and bank robberies, but it's not as if this was only because they were right wing murderers and nobody would have cared otherwise.
 
In the end, neither the extreme right nor the extreme left pose a significant threat in Germany, even though I'd still argue that right wing violence is the bigger problem since it's primarily violence against people while left wing violence is primarily violence against property.

It seems like an arbitrary limit (aside from the language thing, which I think is still the most upvoted comment). It's ok for the Welsh to decide on matters that pertain to the Scots, but it's not ok for the Spanish to decide on matters that pertain to the British, through the exact same mechanism (a directly elected parliament).

As an aside, I find it curious that you refer to the European countries that are not the UK or Ireland as ""Europe"", as if to say you're not European yourself. How would you define an ""European""?

&gt; Also, with Britain it's all done willingly. There's no fear or precedent that the Welsh / Scots / Irish are all going to suddenly gang up and dictate all of England's policies (even though they do have more of a say in our affairs than we do in theirs, due to the West Lothian Question). But in Europe there's this precedent that's started when the EU assigned the leaders of Greece and Italy themselves, rather than letting the people democratically elect them.

I'm going to need sources for that last statement, please. From what I've read, technocratic governments aren't unheard of in Italy and Greece. You're claiming that it was the EU that put them there (even thought the MPs remain the same and can still vote for whatever, or call for a vote of no-confidence if they like).

Unfortunately, instead of doing so in an over-the-time, orderly way, we done it immediately, which caused a major flow of expat return (More than 1 million people, my paternal family included, that was about 15% of the Portuguese population at the time http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Portugal-demography.png) and most of them had :

Yes, but we have more in common than we have to divide us. We (England, Scotland and Wales) shared religion, we shared royalty (four hundred years with Scotland, seven hundred with Wales) and we shared common enemies. We also had a shared fear of Catholicism that I think at the time was scarier for those people than the cold war was for us. During the civil war we didn't kill the king until it was thought he was asking Catholics (in Ireland) for help. By the time religion has ceased to matter we had successful colonies, and most of our attention was there. 

We have some of these things in common with European countries too, but we didn't share their experiences of them. The Dutch, and also many French and Germans were persecuted for being Protestant.  We never really were, but there was a spell of a hundred years or so where we were terrified of it. So terrified that we persecuted the Irish for being Catholic, and began a long involvement there too. 

When the wars of religion were over in Europe they learnt to get on with each other again. They had to, they were neighbours. We didn't, at least not in the same way. When those wars were over we had successful colonies in America and elsewhere and our attention was elsewhere. 

I'm afraid most people here do not know that Portugal is one of our oldest allies. This is a shame, considering how long we have been friends.

At the moment certain areas of power are devolved to the individual nations and some remain at the UK (Westminster) level, if we were to wholeheartedly join the euro project and ultimately it's fiscal/political union then what would be the point of those areas of sovereignty that bind us together as being ""British"" passing through westminster anymore? What would be the point of Wales, England or Scotland dealing Westminster at all? Why not just go either straight to the european level for what was before done at the Westminster level.

- Universities and schools are primarily associated with sports, not intellectual activity; it's apparently not popular to be a learner here. The exception could be a few best universities like MIT, Stanford or Princeton. I was asked countless times for which football team I ""root""; when I say I don't care about anything of the kind, people are surprised. At my place in Europe where I grew up, none of the people I know are sports fans. The latter still exist, but mostly among working class, not university students.

- There are places where you can be legally put to jail for having beer at home, like in some Afghanistan. Forget about having a beer in the street either.

- Stupefying ignorance of the large portion of the population, and wilful ignorance when it comes to new information. A man tried to convince me that ""in god we trust"" is in the US constitution and most people in Israel worshipped Christ; my attempts to tell him the facts failed. A technique very popular among Americans is this: when faced with uncomfortable facts (not just opinions or attitudes about something that already happens or exists), they would say ""I heard you and I disagree""; understanding the absurdity of this is absent, since they also disagree with this statement about absurdity.

- Unusually high number of religious extremists and fundamentalists - probably due to the items above.

- Ghost-looking towns. I was once in a small town in its centre on a working day in the afternoon and I was scared by being the only person around. Where are the people?! Apparently, they are either indoors or in cars.

- Cars are very popular. My lack of ability to drive and thus having no driving licence produces surprise in a lot of people. I am not looking forward to owning a car.

true,zekraut,GERM,Germany,"Wow and this guy is supposed to be a professor? I may have a wrong image of what a professor is in my head.

While the numbers and facts he states are correct at a first glance, they are completly taken out of context. How can a person, who by his position should be very well educated, seriously say that Germany had such a high debt after World War 1 without mentioning that this was because of the treaty of Versailles? 

This happened right after the biggest war in human history (at the time) and one of the harshest peace treaties in modern times. You can't even compare this to greece, who blew all its money on a bloated public sector, an ineffective taxation system and who willingly falsified their public spending statistics to become egilible for the Euro. Germany at the time did not only suffer from internal strife and civil war, but also from massive war reparations (if these were justified or not is another topic) and the loss of huge chunks of its territory. 

Also, the reason for the huge government spendings in the early twenties lay in the Ruhrkampf, which was a passive form of resistance against the french troops occupying the Ruhr area. Again, how can one not mention this? The situation is entirley different. 

But what really got me over the fence was when he actually said that Germany started two world wars - no discussion over the second but historians agree today that while the Kaiserreich was a key factor in the beginning of World War 1, its not alone responsible.

Also, while he is right on the waving of reparations, again this is taken out of context. Germanys enemies in World War 2 did not give Germany a cut because of a kind gesture, but because of the beginning of the Cold War. Back then, the well being of the german industry and its people was a crucial factor in the strategy of the NATO/the USA and there would have been terrible consequences for the western world if the USSR (especially under Stalin) had ever get a hold in Germany.

 If the reparations had been fully paid, thereby crippling the german economy, its very possible that the world had seen a reunification of both german states in the 50s or 60s - but this time, the other way  around. So, when the allies gave Germany a cut, it was serving their best interests at the time. 

And as a final word - it does not suprise me that this guy is german. He is the textbook example of the guilt-ridden, masochistic intellectual german. ",0,1322185482,null,0,false,0,c32j8m8,t3_mob17,t1_c32j8m8,t3_mob17,1427925745,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

Personalentscheidungen wurden vor allem so getroffen, dass mÃ¶glichst wenig Widerspruch zu erwarten war. Dies ist zwar sein gutes Recht als Minister gewesen (und wird sicher auch von vielen anderen so gehandhabt), aber Stil und FÃ¼hrungspersÃ¶nlichkeit beweist es nicht.

Hardly. See below.

&gt; You said yes to my earlier comment. So point out the difference, please.

When you vote for a political party you know exactly who you will get as Prime Minister, because the party leader is selected by the party *before* the election campaign, and is prominent in public life. People often vote for the man (or woman) as much as the party. So your claim that the Prime Minister is ""unelected"" (not directly elected by the populace) is true in theory, but false in practice. 

Who do I vote for to get a certain Commissioner into his post? Oh, that's right. *I can't*. And on top of that, he is not required to answer questions in Parliament, never appears on TV to give speeches or talk to his critics, never has to justify a vote or decision, and never has to fear being voted out of office as long as he has the right friends. He is an appointed cog in a completely opaque machine. 

If you can't see why a large number of people might have a problem with all of that, then I'm going to stop taking you seriously, because you'd obviously be a troll.

I seriously doubt you would ever get that kind of ratio. 

But aside from your hyperbole let's step back a second and look at something like the Lisbon treaty and its forerunner the EU constitution, it is the governments that sign the treaty not the people. 

Were the Irish blocking the will of the ""overwhelming majority""? No, I dont think so, a significant proportion of the French and Dutch disliked the EU constiution enough to scupper it. Other countries populations wanted referenda but were denied. 

So if Malta were to listen to its people and block a law were other governments were passing the law without due consideration of public opinion I would without doubt side with Malta. 

We are seeing the imposition of technocratic governments upon Italy and Greece and no doubt others, we need to be very clear what the parameters of these governments are and when they will step down.

What happens when Italys election is next due and the Eu says ""sorry you're still up shit street we think you should keep the technocrats there""?

People often vote for the man (or woman) as much as the party. So your claim that the Prime Minister is ""unelected"" (not directly elected by the populace) is true in theory, but false in practice.

&gt; Who do I vote for to get a certain Commissioner into his post? Oh, that's right. I can't. And on top of that, he is not required to answer questions in Parliament, never appears on TV to give speeches or talk to his critics, never has to justify a vote or decision, and never has to fear being voted out of office as long as he has the right friends. He is an appointed cog in a completely opaque machine. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the Commission's president subject to a vote by the directly-elected parliament, and then the whole Commission then subject to another vote? And then when the Comission proposes something, don't both the Council of the EU and Parliament have to approve it?

&gt;PORTUGALâS plea for help with its debts from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union last week should be a warning to democracies everywhere.

&gt;The crisis that began with the bailouts of Greece and Ireland last year has taken an ugly turn. However, this third national request for a bailout is not really about debt. Portugal had strong economic performance in the 1990s and was managing its recovery from the global recession better than several other countries in Europe, but it has come under unfair and arbitrary pressure from bond traders, speculators and credit rating analysts who, for short-sighted or ideological reasons, have now managed to drive out one democratically elected administration and potentially tie the hands of the next one.
&gt;
&gt;If left unregulated, these market forces threaten to eclipse the capacity of democratic governments â perhaps even Americaâs â to make their own choices about taxes and spending.
&gt;
&gt;Portugalâs difficulties admittedly resemble those of Greece and Ireland: for all three countries, adoption of the euro a decade ago meant they had to cede control over their monetary policy, and a sudden increase in the risk premiums that bond markets assigned to their sovereign debt was the immediate trigger for the bailout requests.
&gt;
&gt;But in Greece and Ireland the verdict of the markets reflected deep and easily identifiable economic problems. Portugalâs crisis is thoroughly different; there was not a genuine underlying crisis. The economic institutions and policies in Portugal that some financial analysts see as hopelessly flawed had achieved notable successes before this Iberian nation of 10 million was subjected to successive waves of attack by bond traders.
&gt;
&gt;Market contagion and rating downgrades, starting when the magnitude of Greeceâs difficulties surfaced in early 2010, have become a self-fulfilling prophecy: by raising Portugalâs borrowing costs to unsustainable levels, the rating agencies forced it to seek a bailout. The bailout has empowered those ârescuingâ Portugal to push for unpopular austerity policies affecting recipients of student loans, retirement pensions, poverty relief and public salaries of all kinds.
&gt;
&gt;The crisis is not of Portugalâs doing. Its accumulated debt is well below the level of nations like Italy that have not been subject to such devastating assessments. Its budget deficit is lower than that of several other European countries and has been falling quickly as a result of government efforts.
&gt;
&gt;And what of the countryâs growth prospects, which analysts conventionally assume to be dismal? In the first quarter of 2010, before markets pushed the interest rates on Portuguese bonds upward, the country had one of the best rates of economic recovery in the European Union. On a number of measures â industrial orders, entrepreneurial innovation, high-school achievement and export growth â Portugal has matched or even outpaced its neighbors in Southern and even Western Europe.
&gt;
&gt;Why, then, has Portugalâs debt been downgraded and its economy pushed to the brink? There are two possible explanations. One is ideological skepticism of Portugalâs mixed-economy model, with its publicly supported loans to small businesses, alongside a few big state-owned companies and a robust welfare state. Market fundamentalists detest the Keynesian-style interventions in areas from Portugalâs housing policy â which averted a bubble and preserved the availability of low-cost urban rentals â to its income assistance for the poor.
&gt;
&gt;A lack of historical perspective is another explanation. Portuguese living standards increased greatly in the 25 years after the democratic revolution of April 1974. In the 1990s labor productivity increased rapidly, private enterprises deepened capital investment with help from the government, and parties from both the center-right and center-left supported increases in social spending. By the centuryâs end the country had one of Europeâs lowest unemployment rates. 

Page 2

&gt;In fairness, the optimism of the 1990s gave rise to economic imbalances and excessive spending; skeptics of Portugalâs economic health point to its relative stagnation from 2000 to 2006. Even so, by the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007, the economy was again growing and joblessness was falling. The recession ended that recovery, but growth resumed in the second quarter of 2009, earlier than in other countries.
&gt;
&gt;Domestic politics are not to blame. Prime Minister JosÃ© SÃ³crates and the governing Socialists moved to cut the deficit while promoting competitiveness and maintaining social spending; the opposition insisted it could do better and forced out Mr. SÃ³crates this month, setting the stage for new elections in June. This is the stuff of normal politics, not a sign of disarray or incompetence as some critics of Portugal have portrayed it.
&gt;
&gt;Could Europe have averted this bailout? The European Central Bank could have bought Portuguese bonds aggressively and headed off the latest panic. Regulation by the European Union and the United States of the process used by credit rating agencies to assess the creditworthiness of a countryâs debt is also essential. By distorting market perceptions of Portugalâs stability, the rating agencies â whose role in fostering the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States has been amply documented â have undermined both its economic recovery and its political freedom.
&gt;
&gt;In Portugalâs fate there lies a clear warning for other countries, the United States included. Portugalâs 1974 revolution inaugurated a wave of democratization that swept the globe. It is quite possible that 2011 will mark the start of a wave of encroachment on democracy by unregulated markets, with Spain, Italy or Belgium as the next potential victims.
&gt;
&gt;Americans wouldnât much like it if international institutions tried to tell New York City, or any other American municipality, to jettison rent-control laws. But that is precisely the sort of interference now befalling Portugal â just as it has Ireland and Greece, though they bore more responsibility for their fate.
&gt;
&gt;Only elected governments and their leaders can ensure that this crisis does not end up undermining democratic processes. So far they seem to have left everything up to the vagaries of bond markets and rating agencies.

 I'm far from a core supporter of PS and coincidentally, there are many people that agree that the bailout was unnecessary outside of it and many that do agree with it inside the party. People believe Merkel is being selfish because she wants to protect the German economy more than she wants to safeguard European welfare. They're pissed off because now they'll have to pay for what the banks and corrupt politicians didn't do when they were meant to and Merkel wants that to happen.

have a look at the economy of italy over the last decade and compare it to ours. we had brutal reforms and cuts that put us in the position to handle the crisis pretty well. silvio berlusconi used the same time to keep giving gifts to his voter groups financed by additional debt to secure his re-election time and time again, and now we have to pay up to help them out. or look at greece and portugal, they wasted billions on deficitary prestige projects like the 2004 olympics and the football euro cup, useless projects like the vasco de gama bridge in portugal etc. their disneyland economies keep hemorrhaging money and its all somehow our fault. and i am also getting sick of this constant war rhetoric, look up ""crusade"" in the dictionary, it has nothing to do with what i am doing here

why should she? i think people don't want germany to intervene in other countries domestic issues, every time we do people start screaming ""omg the germans are taking over europe"". from our perspective it should be dead simple: you borrow our money, then you pay it back as agreed upon. you buy our products, you pay for them.

Zu Guttenbergs RÃ¼ckkehr gibt es im Privatblog von Frank Rieger (CCC-Sprecher, FAZ-Autor) eine interessante [GerÃ¼chtekÃ¼che](http://frank.geekheim.de/?p=1966) zu lesen. Das ist zwar nur Spekulation, aber sie enthÃ¤lt einige schlÃ¼ssige Punkte. Die Union ist in diesem Szenario nicht die einzige Option fÃ¼r den Plagiator wieder aufs politische Parkett zurÃ¼ckzukehren - das geht auch noch schlimmer. Rieger spricht da von einer potentiellen Partei-NeugrÃ¼ndung, einer ""Neo-Nationalen Partei"".


Selbst wenn Guttenberg einer solchen Partei nicht vorstehen mÃ¶chte, kann es sein, dass er diese MÃ¶glichkeit als politisches Druckmittel im innerparteilichen Machtkampf benutzt oder zumindest eine ""Vergeben&amp;Vergessen-SolidaritÃ¤t"" erzwingt.

I agree about the protection from unemployment. This is one of the cases.

About the ""PIIGS"" -- I'm not advocating its usage. I'm just saying that it is a shorter way of saying ""those European countries that have got fiscal problems"". And it means just that. Anyone who acts condescending towards people of these countries because of this is a moron. Every thinking person in Europe KNOWS that working peoples of PIIGS countries didn't decide for them to be like that, nor in any way consciously agreed to this terms, in which their countries suffer now.

I'm using the PIIGS acronym, because it sounds better than SIGIP and also goes with a story, that you dislike: ""countries that take advantage of the EU are unfair pigs"". This is just a story and no one takes it seriously.

About that ""soviet"" thing... I'm not really concerned, you see. All post-communist countries came this REALLY LONG WAY since then, that saying thing like that is just going to make you feel stupid. No one (if anyone) is even going to get offended by that, it's just too absurd.

true,RedZupp,null,null,"Ein sehr interessanter Blog-Eintrag und in seiner Darstellung wahrscheinlich nÃ¤her an der Wahrheit als vielen von uns lieb ist/sein wÃ¼rde. Ein Blick in die dazugehÃ¶rige Kommentarsektion macht es schon deutlich, zwar sind genug Leute gegen zu Guttenberg, ABER es gibt auch genug FÃ¼rsprecher. Nimmt man die Leserbriefrubriken der Zeitungen, Umfragen etc. dazu, so verdunkelt sich das Bild weiter. Von der GrÃ¼ndung einer Partei rechts der Union spricht man ja seit einigen Jahren immer wieder. Die im Blog angesprochene Politik Merkels gibt dem Ganzen allerdings im Moment eine besondere Brisanz. Viele traditionelle UnionswÃ¤hler sind vom sehr linken Kurs (nach UnionsmaÃstÃ¤ben) der Kanzlerin abgestoÃen. Obwohl es in den letzten Jahren genÃ¼gend Versuche gegeben hat solche Parteien zu grÃ¼nden, sind die meisten ja doch entweder direkt wieder zugrunde gegangen oder Marginalie geblieben (man denke an Herrn Schill in Hamburg oder die ebenfalls im Blog angesprochene ""Die Freiheit"").  Ein erneuter Versuch kÃ¶nnte glÃ¼cklicher verlaufen: die hÃ¤ufig kritisierte Profilosigkeit der Union, die SchwÃ¤che/das Sterben der FDP, die Wirtschaftskrise, genereller Politikverdruss gegenÃ¼ber den Etablierten etc. - Der NÃ¤hrboden ist selten besser gewesen. 

PersonalmÃ¤Ãig kÃ¶nnte man sicher einige Leute rekrutieren, Koch wurde angesprochen und ich erinnere auch gerne an Friedrich Merz, der ja selbst schon mal als Gallionsfigur einer solchen Partei gehandelt wurde. Weitere Unzufriedene lieÃen sich sicher abwerben. Geldgeber scheint es ja geben. 

Machen wir uns nichts vor, der Nationalismus kehrt zurÃ¼ck nach Europa. VerstÃ¤ndlich? Irgendwie schon. WÃ¼nschenswert? Nie und nimmer! Die Ursachen sind derartig vielfÃ¤ltig, dass man unmÃ¶glich auf alle eingehen kann. Ich will aber doch auf einige GrÃ¼nde eingehen, die ich fÃ¼r wichtig halte:

1. Europa (Ich verwende den Begriff Europa mal als Sammelbegriff fÃ¼r alle Aspekte europÃ¤ischer Einigung und AnnÃ¤herung) erscheint heute zunÃ¤chst als Belastung. Auch die gebetsmÃ¼hlenhaften Erinnerungen der Politik an das Gegenteil verklingen ungehÃ¶rt. Denkt man an Europa, dann denkt man daran, dass ""Deutschland ja sowieso fÃ¼r alle anderen bezahlen muss"" - SchlieÃlich weiÃ jeder, dass die SÃ¼dlÃ¤nder eh alle faul sind und maximal dazu taugen Horst, Heinz und Dieter auf der jÃ¤hrlichen Tour des Kegelsvereins nach Malle mit der nÃ¶tigen Ladung Bier und Bratkartoffeln zu versorgen... Zynismus aus!
Die VorzÃ¼ge Europas, vom Euro (Ja, auch der Euro hat seine Vorteile) Ã¼ber die FreizÃ¼gigkeit bis hin zum Binnenmarkt, werden von den meisten entweder nicht wahrgenommen oder nicht genutzt. SchlieÃlich wird der Frieden den wir erleben und der in diesem MaÃe in Europa seit einigen Hundert Jahren nicht mehr vorgekommen ist, als selbstverstÃ¤ndlich hingenommen. 

Der Preis von Frieden, Wohlstand und Wachstum erscheint den meisten Menschen heute als zu hoch. Europa ist in Deutschland hÃ¶chstens gut, wenn es gilt Subventionen abzugreifen.

2. Die Wirtschaftskrise. Dieser Punkt ist eng mit dem vorhergehenden verbunden, geht jedoch darÃ¼ber hinaus. Noch steht Deutschland gut da -  Fatalerweise kÃ¶nnte man leider fast sagen, denn nun scheint es, als ob man hierzulande als letztes arbeitsames VÃ¶lkchen in Europa buckelt, nur um am Ende von den ""anderen"" mit in den Abgrund gezogen zu werden. Volkswirtschaftliche ZusammenhÃ¤nge lasse ich jetzt mal auÃer Acht, die Quintessenz der Aussage ist folgende: So befÃ¶rdert man unguten Nationalismus.

3. Die Sehnsucht nach einer FÃ¼hrerfigur. Der Bezug auf Barbarossa kam nicht umsonst. In unruhigen Zeiten sehnen sich Menschen immer nach jemandem, der ihnen die Last der Entscheidung abnimmt. Zu Guttenberg hat zwar wenig auf der Erreicht-Liste vorzuweisen, ein Mann groÃer Worte ist er jedoch allemal. UnterstÃ¼tzt von den richtigen Medien, in diesem Fall vor allem der allseits beliebten Bild (die ich Ã¼brigens immer mit groÃem GenuÃ lese und im Gegensatz zu vielen anderen nicht als stumpfes Idiotenblatt abtue; einen grÃ¶Ãen Fehler kÃ¶nnte man bei dem meistgelesenen Blatt kaum machen), erfÃ¼llt zu Guttenberg ausgezeichnet die Rolle eines pseudo-messianischen Retters der Nation.

Man kÃ¶nnte Unmengen weiteres anfÃ¼gen, aber da ich hier einerseits sowieso schon wieder zuviel geschrieben habe und das hier nicht mein Blog ist, mÃ¶chte ich zum Ende kommen. Ich gebe zu, von einer solchen NNP geht ein Sirenengesang aus, dem auch ich mich nicht ganz verschlieÃen kann. Ich fÃ¼rchte keine Negativauswirkungen einer deutschen oder deutsch-franzÃ¶sischen Hegemonie Ã¼ber Europa (die besteht wirtschaftlich ja ohnehin schon), solange es eine wohlwollende Hegemonie ist und den Charakter eines primus inter pares hat. Wir haben im Westen 40 Jahre lang unter der wohlwollenden Hegemonie der USA gelebt und es ist uns gut bekommen. Auch andere Punkte, etwa die Durchsetzung vitaler nationaler Interessen (z.B. Sicherung von Handelswegen), sehe ich weniger kritisch. An diese RealitÃ¤t werden wir uns gewÃ¶hnen mÃ¼ssen wenn wir unseren Lebenstandart beibehalten wollen. Was mich ohne Ende abstÃ¶Ãt, das ist die neue und besondere Betonung des nationalen, der Ãberwachung und die implizite Fremdenfeindlichkeit. Gerade in Europa begann man gerade von einer beginnenden Post-Staatlichkeit zu sprechen, hier erleben wir den gedanklichen Schritt zurÃ¼ck. In einer Zeit, in der Europa nicht mehr im Zentrum der Welt steht (weil sich das mehr und mehr in den Pazifik verlagert) birgt eine Neo-Fragmentierung ungeahnte Gefahren. Deutschland kann und darf sich eine solche Entwicklung nicht leisten.

 First comes the obliteration of our fishing fleets, and other production quotas we often reach, resulting in waste and loss of profit so much more fertile Central Europe can profit instead. Yes, we do get paid for it, but it does nothing for national pride.

Which is actually hurt by the second cause of resentment, the constant name calling - PIIGS, lazy southerners, etc. We're not actually lazy. Everyday I take the bus,  and everyday it is filled. Even at diferent hours. We do try to walk around, but the difference is that we mostly just prefer to spend our money rather than invest it. We also have less productivity, although we work more than, say, Germany, because of different cultural attributes. It just seems, sometimes, that we are penalized for it, when it is cultural difference that makes Europe richer. We're actually a bit sensitive, and proud, about that. After all, northeners usually pick the south for vacations, for good reasons ;)

That said, and this is my sincere opinion based on reading news and listening to bus talk as a reasonable source of popular hearsay, we do not consider the german people arrogant, at all, although the price for help is considered very high, but we'd certainly appreciate if you leashed your top politicians so they do not mutter bullshit about the South's inferiority, and please do not allow Merkel to raise the spectre of war as an argument ever again.

That's a bit too positive of light on my culture. Things in Holland generally work, but it is because we have a culture of **complain, confront, blame &amp; shame**. And if we were as big as Germany, it is not unthinkable we would have acted with the same kind of arrogance towards the rules as they did. It's just that we would not expect others to pay for such flaws. 

You can interpret us is many ways: some people call us blunt, others call us honest, but just as many consider us impolite assholes. And they are at the very least partially right. 

Typical examples how this plays out:
- you pay for each drink, everywhere
- you pay for using the toilet, everywhere
- you don't just split the tab, you pay for your drinks
- our politicians, and even the corporate elite here, doesn't wines and dines on official time (they have to do their negotiations with bad coffee and McDonalds take-out)

In the end, culturally it goes back to [Calvijn](http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Calvijn) .. we kept the you-are-not-allowed-to-have-fun-nature of the protestants, but not the religion itself. (side-note: this is why parties in Holland are lead by the idiots and the teens, very much unlike Belgium, Germany or France)

That's also why it doesn't apply to all of the Netherlands. Religion may not be that dominant anymore, _the line of the Spanish occupation still clearly separates a protestant ethos and a catholic ethos_. The attitude i described above applies to the northern 80% (estimate). The south, together with about half of Belgium often seems like some sort of twilight to me between the northern and southern European cultures. 

&gt;Your politicians truly must be made from a different dough

That is partially true. I don't think it's unique to Holland though.

Our last election was all about about the economy and government spending, and a little bit about immigration. We had to cut government spending. The question was, by how much, and how fast. The party that won, _promised to hurt us the most_. There was no debate about the actual impact of all the plans. The opposition said ""what you propose is going to hurt people financially in the short term"".. and that party said ""yes, exactly. If people want that, vote for us""..

And most voters did, except in the South (there's that line again!). 

**So, you want politics like in Holland?**

Do what we do. Vote for the party that promises to hurt you the most.

true,sadscience,EURO,UK,"I think you're largely correct in thinking that support for integration is divided into policy areas. But then, since the mid-1990s pollsters have focused on support for integration in policy areas rather than integration in general. It's a more useful focus for an EU obsessed with subsidiarity. That might be why so much data is produced to support your theory.

For instance, the most recent relevant Eurobarometer report that I could find was [Eurobarometer 69](http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb69/eb69_part3_en.pdf) (2008), and it deals with the idea of integration policy-by-policy. I'll quote the relevant section on page 7:
&gt;When asked to indicate whether decision-making would be more appropriate at European or national level in twenty areas, Europeans are divided. A majority of them consider that decisions should be taken jointly at European level in the following eleven sectors: fighting terrorism (79%), protecting the environment (71%), scientific and technological research (70%), defence and foreign affairs (64%), support for regions facing economic difficulties (62%), energy (61%), immigration and fighting crime (58%), competition (55%), agriculture and fishery and fighting inflation (51%) and finally consumer protection (50%).

&gt;But the people interviewed believe that seven policy areas are better managed at national level: pensions (73%), taxation (68%), social welfare (67%), the education system (66%), health (64%), fighting unemployment (57%) and, by a very small majority, the economy (49%). Finally, EU27 citizens are split right down the middle as regards transport: 48% consider that decisions should be taken jointly at European level and an identical proportion think that decisions should be taken at national level.

It seems that *in theory* the European public is quite favourable of European integration in quite a few policy areas. I thought even those areas where national decision-making was considered more appropriate were surprisingly low majorities.

I also recently read an article called 'Post-Maastricht Blues: The Transformation of Citizen Support for European Integration, 1973â2004' by Richard C. Eichenberga and Russell J. Dalton (Acta Politica, 2007, 42, (128â152)). They noted how public support for integration eroded after Maastricht and the adoption of EMU. [Here's a graph they use to demonstrate this](http://i.imgur.com/Z1xpx.png). They essentially argue that developments in the 90s introduced political considerations into peoples' view of the EU, whereas before it was usually seen in purely economic terms. Their article takes any analysis up to 2004. It'd be interesting to see date on how public support fares after the Lisbon Treaty, but sadly I struggled to find any decent stuff.

I think the issue of support for European integration is strongly linked to trust in the EU and EU institutions. The data for this is easier to find (the EU are obviously quite worried about this trend in public opinion at the moment), and it demonstrates a noticeable decrease in trust for the EU. Quoting from [Eurobarometer 73](http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb73/eb73_vol1_en.pdf) (2011):

&gt;Today, 42% of Europeans tend to trust the European Union, 6 points less than in the Eurobarometer autumn 2009 wave, while 47% do not trust it (+7) and 11% expressed no opinion (-1).

I think it's unlikely for the public to support further integration if trust is low (and decreasing). 

It's a complicated issue. Much more complicated than just positing the question ""Federal Europe: Yes/No?"". As well as issues of trust you could also arguably link in data on public views on whether there is democratic deficit, questions of identity...

Although we did have the 'Zalm-rule', (Zalm is the name of minister of Finance in the 90ties) which is still in place. It comes down to this: you budget your year conservatively. Then when it's a good year, the taxes will run a profit. This _has_ to be used on paying of the debt.

But, don't make the mistake to think that cutting government spending actually increases the economic productivity. It does the opposite in the short term, simply because the sum of consumer and gov spending increases. Also unlike consumer spending, gov spending ends up way more local. So, that hits twice.

The only long term advantage is that you stop paying more interest on debt. But that's the thing. Most people, even countries may not have the discipline to not spent all their money in the good years. But if that's the case you can't afford to lend money in the bad years. 

That's the thing. If we want to cut spending, it's going to hurt. But like burning down a forest .. things grow back more quickly (in the right direction: export!) if you take the pain quickly. 

There is a part of any economy that isn't very flexible to change. It's better if they die off quickly, so their resources can be used by more flexible approaches.

One of the reasons, why a country like Holland is still doing OK economically, is because we had the pain in the past. We lost a lot of industries. But with India, China, Brazil .. .. those oldskool industries were just dragging us down. We are a much more service oriented economy now, and that's working out much better.

This may sound like right-winged rethoric, but it's not. It worked out better, because of a lot of government influence: fiscally stimulating part-time jobs, financing higher education for everybody, regulating the banks (so the profit of small companies actually allows the company, and not their bank, to grow)

It's just important to balance the books. I don't mind higher taxation .. if that economically works out for the best. But we can't spend what we don't have .. that's an endless pit, and somehow that dark money always ends up being pops and moms savings/pension account.

&gt; Dividing kids into racial groups has been the practice in at least one Norwegian high school, where ethnicity determined where kids sat.
&gt; 
&gt; With the story in the media glare on Thursday, the schoolâs principal was ordered to âre-do the arrangementâ by Oslo cityâs education committee.
&gt; 
&gt; School staff said the practice of grouping kids by their racial background was forced on them by the flight of âethnic Norwegianâ students to other schools.
&gt; 
&gt; âWe chose in the end to take the slightly difficult decision to place 14 ethnic Norwegian pupils in each of the two classes and none in the third,â Bjerke VideregÃ¥ende school department head Hanna Norum Eliassen told broadcaster NRK.
&gt; 
&gt; âIt has resulted in fewer Norwegian students leaving,â said Eliassen, who said the experiment, if successful, was to have delivered the type of multicultural school the staff wanted. She said the alternative was a âsadâ division between âbrownâ and âwhiteâ schools.
&gt; 
&gt; A few of Osloâs cramped neighbourhoods have been transformed by the influx of newcomers to Norway with refugees and foreign workers settling in tiny city enclaves.
&gt; 
&gt; Pressed by the cityâs overseer, the school principal admitted she had erred.
&gt; 
&gt; âWe see that this division was wrong, and we will undertake a new grouping,â Bjerke school principal Gro Flaten told NRK.
&gt; 
&gt; â(The new groups) will have mixed pupils of both ethnic Norwegian and non-ethnic-Norwegian background,â Flaten told news agency NTB.

&gt; It takes much more than one or two generations being born in said country to integrate.

What is this based on? 

Personally I know teenagers and older people coming to Germany and becoming German in all but their passports in under ten years. I also have a sister in law who was born and raised in Asia to an Asian family. She came to the US at the age of 16 and when I saw her graduating her American college at the age of 22 she was as American as one can be. And I can tell Americans and other people apart. I was in the US for a year for an exchange back in High School.

In Germany we don't really have a concept for integration. Until a couple years ago our citizenship laws hadn't changed for about a hundred years and were still based on bloodlines. If you great grandfather was German, you were German. Much like you think integration works. And Germans are pretty racist in that the general consensus ist that you can't be German if you don't look German. This is not mean spirited, but rather accepted custom. 

So when people of different races are integrated into our culture, they often times also integrate this value set to the extent that even though they behave German, eat German, talk German, dream German and share everything else, they think of themselves as foreigners. Because that is part of being German. Seeing people of a different race as foreign. I know a Columbian woman who was adopted as a toddler by a German family and never saw Columbia again. Not even she considers herself 100% German. Because she looks in the mirror and, being German, sees a foreigner. That is how deeply ingrained non-integration is into our culture.

But back to your statement about people needing generations instead of a couple years to integrate: Do you have any evidence of this? Granted, I only have circumstancial evidence, but a lot of it.

1. Americans say lots of super controversial and offensive shit all the damn time, see Fox News, Republicans, the American South, etc.

2. I'll give him this, but honestly i'd rather have people be friendly instead of miserable all the time.

3. Related to number 2, but there isn't anything wrong with smiling.

4. Restaurant workers and waiters in the U.S. do not get a proper hourly wage like they do in Europe, they get around $2.50 an hour and make the rest of their money in tips. I think this is wrong, but that's how it's done.

5. Taxes are not displayed on prices in the US because unlike in Europe the US isn't a unitary political body with standardized tax rates on everything. The States decide a sales tax rate, and then a county can decide a further tax rate, and then a city can add a further tax rate on top of the other taxes. It would be expensive and incredibly difficult for a business to print prices in this way, but it is an annoyance. It's not to rip people off.

6. Too much advertising but it's the same everywhere, advertising is a fact of life in a western capitalist economy. 

7. Wasteful consumerism? Yes, the US does have a problem with that but it's the same everywhere, spend 5 minutes in any shopping mall or high street in europe and you'll see people going crazy for shit they don't need, stop acting as if it's an exclusively american phenomenon.

8. Idiotic stereotypes are a worldwide thing, not exclusively American, for example ""all Americans are fat, lol big macs!!"" when the Obesity rate in the US is lower than some European countries now.

9. America is a country populated by immigrants from all around the world and the culture is thus an amalgamation of that. I see nothing wrong with people wanting to retain a portion of their ethnic heritage.

10. The drinking age at 21 is silly but let's not act as if the UK doesn't have stupid ID laws, i've seen my mum get ID'd before and she is 49, and it's usually store policy to ID anyone who looks under 30. 

11. Religion, yes i'll give you that, but not everyone of them is crazy. Stay out of the south and you'll be fine.

12. Corporations win everywhere, don't tell me that there aren't ubiquitous examples of fast food chains all over europe. Sure, America has a more flawed political and economic system but it's really no different to other places. Ask people where they think the food is good, i'm sure their smiling faces would be happy to give you a good tip!

13. Yeah, the transport system is a problem, especially outside of most major cities. Keep in mind that this is partially down to the fact that the continental US is bigger than the whole of Europe and holds far less people, which means the population is much more spread out. They can and should do better though.

14. I'm pretty sure life is fast paced in most places these days, but Americans have it worse as far as workers rights and benefits go. 

15. I'm pretty sure people are money obsessed wherever you go.

16. I see no problem with getting more food for less money, and if you have any left over ask for a container and take it home with you.

17. Yeah, the America number 1 attitude is annoying, but not everyone is like that and isn't he basically doing the same thing here by making out as if europe is number 1 and possesses none of these cultural phenomena?

true,DocTomoe,GERM,Germany,"&gt; Germany has no strict gun control either and so do other countries with low crime rate like Canada or even Sweden.

Excuse me? I can't talk for Sweden, but German gun control is almost paranoid, and after a few school shooting incidents in the last decade, it got even worse. Rule of thumb: You cannot buy a gun here if you are not a hunter or a sport shooter, and those have to adhere to security standards that make it unfeasible to use them in large-scale crime.

&gt; Look at Germany and Stuttgart 21 demonstrations.

Yes. And then look what happened to the guys who ordered that. The ruling party (Ruling since the late 1940s!) got removed by elections, the police chief got kicked out of his office, and there are very serious charges against the officers. Compare this to the pat on the head and the paid vacation for the OWS-policemen.

&gt; For the guy who lost his eyesight the police was doing its job pretty ""militant"".

Right. If you happen to chance getting a water thrower pointing directly at your eye, your eye is likely to get destroyed. This was the off chance, and most likely not intended as a viable mission target. How does this compare to fracturing skulls with batons?

&gt; You are free to choose another doctor at any time.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; It seems that in theory the European public is quite favourable of European integration in quite a few policy areas. I thought even those areas where national decision-making was considered more appropriate were surprisingly low majorities.

Yes, I agree, the reactions were quite surprising, although it's difficult to tell exactly what people mean by their response. To take transport as an example, 'jointly make decisions at a European level' could mean, on the one hand, a European authority set up for standardizing signalling, tracks etc, and for encouraging cross-border services, or it could mean state-owned 'European Rail', 'European Buses' etc, or anything in between. Anyone reasonable would agree that the former was a good idea, but even though I think a lot of people are in favour of socialist policies within their country, I struggle to believe they want a European socialist state.

&gt; I think it's unlikely for the public to support further integration if trust is low (and decreasing). 

I suppose this could well be the compromise between the two ideas I mention. Essentially that people like the idea of a unified Europe in an ill-defined way, and they are willing to support slow expansion so long as it turns out a success. That is a combination of the idea of subsidiarity with public acceptance of their inability to prejudge which policies would work at a European level. I must admit one of the major things I find annoying about the EU is that it constantly wants more powers even while it is making a hash of those it already has. The disagreement then arises between the super and supra-nationalists because they have different judgements of what will work at that level.

But if people are clear-cut about not wanting a European nation state I think that is important. It means the process of integration should be slowed, that we need to feel our way forward rather than leaping into the unknown. We might even settle temporarily upon a British conception of a liberal, single-market Europe alongside a stabilized Eurozone for a while, and unify as and when economies and cultures converge.",0,1322359101,null,0,false,0,c330dgq,t3_mpa3w,t1_c330dgq,t1_c32ritg,1427934030,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,democritusparadise,EURO,Ireland and USA,"Very interesting. As an Irishman who has recently moved to the US, I see some truth to this article. A lot of it is mainly down to the author's preferences, and I think that many of things he lists (obsession with money, gun ownership, stereotypes of other nations, for example) lose much of their punch because they aren't only American problems. Europeans have problems of their own, some of them being mainly European problems which the US doesn't have, others being problems the US shares, and these are glossed over and it isn't really fair to complain about the US in relation to them and not even mention Europe. 

Despite this, there are a few hard hitters here which I agree with. I've been living in the US for 3 months now, and I've come to realise that the smiles are indeed fake. I always thought that Americans were very friendly, but I now that I've been interacting with them on a regular basis I've been getting the impression that many Americans are paranoid (for example, Pizza hut won't give you your pizza until you give them the money. What are you going to do, slam the door in their face and run out of the back?). I find they expect dishonesty instead of honesty, and this is a serious cultural neurosis with dangerous consequences. I think much of this can be traced to income inequality and poverty, which is certainly much more serious in the US than the EU (not that it isn't a problem in Europe). This further manifests in business culture, which I find less honest than business culture in Europe. I've noticed that business here is less interested in service and more interested you parting with your money, and they'll devise elaborate ""plans"" and ""packages"" and ""deals"" and so on to obfuscate the true cost. This goes from the very top, with confusing contracts with serious small print, to the very bottom, with sickeningly friendly salespeople (who you know don't really care about how your day is) who don't actually tell you the downs of their product even when you ask. 

This follows into the bit about tipping, which I'm on board with. It's a wealth tax which passes the responsibility of making sure the waiter gets a living wage from the employer to the customer, which is immoral. The good news is that if tips don't bring up the wage to the state minimum, the employer must make up the difference, so the employee is protected from making less than minimum either way.

I agree that America is built for cars, and that this is bad. Having just moved here from Ireland, I still haven't gotten a full license and I feel stranded. I'm dependent on family and friends to get to work or play. It's obviously due to the fact that there's a lot of space in the US, and since the 50's it was economically feasible for everyone to make their own way.

Finally, big business. The power of big business is the US far outstrips its power in Europe, and it has now gotten to the state in the US where the needs of the people are being usurped by the wants of the very wealthy and by big business. It is within the legal power of the government to bring the super rich to heel, as FDR did, it's simply a matter of political will. I'd add that Europeans shouldn't be complacent; business takeover of government can happen to us too, and already is to some degree (for example, when market pressure can make a PM quit, but corruption, crime and sex with underage prostitutes cannot, this is telling).

true,SimonGray,DENK,NÃ¸rrebro,"Sure xenophbia and racism exist here like anywhere on the planet: some people are scared of people that look different, and sure lots of old people suffer from it, but also lower class people tend to be more xenophobic than the average Dane. It's really not much different from all those xenophobic people in the US that vote republican. You're playing into a Germanic master race stereotype by saying it has something to do with blondness or some other ridiculous attribute like that.

This idea that people divide others into blondes and non-blondes has absolutely _nothing_ to do with what xenophobia looks like in Denmark at least. It'd be more correct to divide people into beer drinkers and non-beer drinkers; or dividing people into hijab wearers and non-hijab wearers. Basically, muslims of any race. I have no doubt that there are many racists here in Denmark, but on the whole this one of the least racist countries in the world, despite what impression you might get from those idiots in Dansk Folkeparti.

Most of the people that are scared of muslims here are scared of the religion, first and foremost, and of the politically correct tolerance to a religion which they see as totalitarian and conflicting with Danish values of strong social liberties.

Whether or not something is politically incorrect has to do with how media and policies treat the issue. In Scandinavia, there is a ""humanism comes first"" attitude as well as a ""universal values"" attitude. It is politically incorrect to single out any minority with policies, the policies are always universal. That's why here in Denmark, we have the incredibly stupid ""24-year law"" which says that Danes cannot marry and bring home foreigners until they're older than 24. The law was meant to combat forced marriages of young immigrants whose families ""import"" a wife or husband from their home country. It would not have been ok with Danes to single out second-generation immigrants so the policy affects all Danish citizens, but is still controversial.

Whenever there's a conflict between Muslims and other Danes in Denmark, it's because of the clash of universal values and minority values. Danes will respect and tolerate different values of minorities to the point that they infringe on their own values; a good example is the Muhammad cartoons controversy a couple of years back.

true,deepanddeeper,,FFM,"In their official list of intentions before elections, there is no mention of religion. Politics in Germany is concentrated on social, economic, education, health and EU/NATO issues. Abortion, stem cell, gay marriage debates are not in the foreground and do not really create cleavage points in election season. However, they want Christian holidays to remain official holidays and would like crosses to remain hanging in classrooms of public schools. Are against the abolishment of religion classes in schools aswell. The mention of religion in their title helps them win or keep traditional 50+ voters...
