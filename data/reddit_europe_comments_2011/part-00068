What can go wrong? **Everything.**

Same problem as with 1960's style macroeconomics: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfoundations

For example, income inequality is a broad aggregate of many different situations, not a ""thing"" in itself: two people can be inequal because A robbed B, but also because A is better than B, how can one aggregate it and assume it is the same thing? Similarly, 50 years ago homosexuality was considered a mental illness, now more and more homophobia is considered one, plus such stats only show the worst kinds of mental states but not the best kinds, so again it is too broad and too aggregate to use.

The correct approach would be that this study shows what certain things that cause income inequality might also cause other problems, and more detailed and deeper research should be launched into exactly how and why.

But claiming that by reducing inequality by any way these are solved / reduced.... I find it very dishonest and I think the purpose of this book is to construct a pseudo-science for reaffirmin **already existing** left-wing prejudices...

Yesterday I bought more stuff from Amazon ES (computer components) and it was ALSO dispatched from Germany.

It would seem that overall there is some kind of ""scam"" going on with the price differences when they all end up coming from Germany ANYWAY :P

They dispatched it with Express shipping from Germany because Spain's amazon allowed me that option.

Here is something to test out.. Anybody from Germany that wants to order computer components.. Try to buy it from Spanish Amazon.. You will save a few euros and if I'm not mistaken it will be sent to you from Germany anyway :P

Either way I am happy and I don't even care where it actually comes from... yesterday's purchase has saved me like 150-200 euros already (due to the local prices).

Amazon ES: http://i.imgur.com/923yS.png

How about they just make a single Amazon.eu with the same prices (+ VAT for destination country... exactly as they currently bill anyway)? It would seem that each item category has a specific place it ships from anyway :P

Aujourd'hui je dis que le commerce avec la Chine, et surtout la vente de l'infrastructure logistique aux chinois est la chose la plus dangereuse au monde en ce moment.

L'Europe est en train de se mettre dans le même plateau. 

La Chine à désormais une très grande partie de la production mondiale en à peu près tout, une infrastructure qui peut être facilement transformé en une infrastructure de fabrique d'armes. Ils ont la plus grosse population au monde avec une surpopulation de jeunes mâles par rapport aux jeunes femelles d'à peu près 20 Millions en grande partie à cause de la sélection prénatale.

I haven't stated anything about the Chinese not wanting to get political conditions attached to the money. They have already made their intention of exactly that clear, amongst others they want the EU to tone down its criticism of Chinese monetary policy. China will try to get as much influence as possible, as would any other actor. That is given.

But the EU still has to agree to these conditions. China cannot impose its will unilaterally. And while Chinese funds would easy the pain of this crisis, our European leaders have already made an agreement which is financed solely by its European member states. So China does not have a huge leverage, as their support isn't vital to European economy.

My main hope is of course that China will get no political conditions attached to the money.

compare our gdp per capita to yours and then tell me who's better off right now, then compare our economic development since the eurozone started, you are in a pretty bad state of denial

""Where low paid jobs should be; in Eastern Europe and China.""

you see, around here a mercedes or bmw employee is a highly paid specialist, not someone in a lowpaid job, that ""outsourcing is cheaper/more efficient"" shit was just the way your government sold you on giving up your economic power as an exporting nation while making foreign companies and their ceos richer. and btw thanks for letting bmw buy the useful leftovers of rover for cheap, someone in your nation didn't think this whole thing through...

""Er, seen Greece and Italy? And what about the Parisian Banlieues?""

none of the above mentioned countries had wide-spread looting going on in their capital cities, unlike britain, from over here it looked like some third-world nation in the middle of a revolution

""Yep, all that American money went to good use I agree, and the wage deflation you've undergone since reunification has allowed you to keep prices down while Club Med exploded, like I said, congratulations :)""

we paid a price for all that american money, they build up west germany to create a buffer zone against the warsaw pact, west germans grew up knowing that the heart of their country was supposed to be the main battleground for ww3, and even in that state of crisis we managed to become richer and more powerful than everyone else on this continent in a matter of decades, says a lot about german mentality and work ethic if you ask me...

""yeah, that's why you're on an American site and speaking English. What ever our relative decline in the world I think culture is one where you're clearly wrong.""

i spend much more time on german websites and forums, and unlike most native british and american people i can proudly say that i am fluent in more than one language, but keep telling yourself that you are still an important culture, while we keep running the entire continent and use english politicians as the punchline for our jokes ;-)

The Greek government and the Greek upper and middleclass have screwed themselves royally, the first by fabricating data to gain entrance into the Euro and the second by going along, not paying their taxes and creating a society in which fraud florishes.  
The Greek lower middle class and lower class believe that this crisis is now to be resolved by punishing them, the least responsible. Many also seem to think the Germans make their government do this and burn German flags.  
I as a German have not made a Greek suffer in my entire life, I have not even invaded France and killed Jews. Even my grandfather has not, since he was one year to young to be enlisted. So any Greek that still calls all Germans Nazis is wrong, simple as that. They should also differentiate between Germans and their government, if they talk about their government screwing them over, they should realize that not all Germans are actively hitting Greeks in the groin also.  
Now me personally, I do not know what is to be done to combat the debt crisis and lets face it, 95% of the population have just as little an idea as I have. Finance, economics, politics and other fields come into play here and people that are not experts in all of these fields should not be thinking of themselves as such. What many Germans feel though is this: ""We are supposed to pay for the Greeks debt with our tax money and for that they call us Nazis and wish us to the devil"".  
That is a very understandable thought, just as understandable as the thoughts of young poorer Greeks that they are getting screwed by the establishment.

true,filip_latinovicz,CROA,Croatia,"Just a few issues I have with this article:

&gt;Yet one rising star of Croatian politics ... Natasha Srdoc, founder and chair of the Adriatic Institute for Public Policy (AI)

She is a political anonymus with no significance. This article is in fact first time I've ever heard of her

&gt;In addition to new laws mandating transparency, Srdoc wants to prosecute all politicians, past and present, who have amassed unexplained wealth. She’d seize misappropriated amounts that reportedly total multiple billions and use the money to help pay down Croatia’s debt. No wonder she’s been stigmatized as “an enemy of the state” by the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) or that she and her family have been threatened.

I don't know if she and her family have been threatened but that ""enemy of the state"" part is plainely ridiculous. Same things are being repeated regurlarely for the past several years by numerous journalists and politicians, nothing new.

&gt;Whatever their actual source, those threats are not likely idle. Among other deadly incidents, media publisher and regime critic Ivo Pukanic died in a 2008 car bomb explosion in Zagreb. Six men were convicted in what was vaguely depicted in the media as an organized crime hit.

I'm unsure but it seems to me that they are trying to imply this was government sponsored murder. (which is rather bold claim, aspecially without any evidencce or indication for sich an act)

&gt;The socialist SDP party already supports recourse to the IMF.)

**S**ocial **D**emocratic **P**arty of Croatia - social-democrats are NOT the same thing as socialists (though having in mind that US Americans actualy have a serious debate over wether Obama is a socialist or not this is not so surprising), and they do NOT support the IMF.

&gt;According to Srdoc, TI Croatia receives funding from the state-owned electrical company HEP, which itself came under corruption charges, and from Croatia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

... and European Commission, Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, National Foundation for Civil Society,

&gt;If nations like Croatia play a larger role on the international stage without stepped-up anticorruption initiatives, that balance will be strained beyond endurance.

I seriously doubt Croatia is/is going to be even remotely significant as the author of the article is trying to suggest

This article is shamefully  obvious (paid?) ad for this Natasha Srdoc and has no journalistic value what so ever. Someone is trying to promote their own candidate on the upcoming elections.

A. E. Housman (1859–1936).  A Shropshire Lad.  1896.
 
XIII. When I was one-and-twenty
 
 
WHEN I was one-and-twenty	
  I heard a wise man say,	
‘Give crowns and pounds and guineas	
  But not your heart away;	
 
Give pearls away and rubies	       
  But keep your fancy free.’	
But I was one-and-twenty,	
  No use to talk to me.	
 
When I was one-and-twenty	
  I heard him say again,	        
‘The heart out of the bosom	
  Was never given in vain;	
’Tis paid with sighs a plenty,   
  And sold for endless rue.’	
And I am two-and-twenty,	
  And oh, ’tis true, ’tis true.


Samuel Johnson. 1709–1784
  
450. One-and-Twenty
  
LONG-EXPECTED one-and-twenty,

  Free to mortgage or to sell,	 
Wild as wind, and light as feather,

  All the names that banish care;	  
Lavish of your grandsire's guineas,	 
  Show the spirit of an heir.  

All that prey on vice and folly	 
  Joy to see their quarry fly:	 
There the gamester, light and jolly,	
  There the lender, grave and sly.	 
 
Wealth, my lad, was made to wander,	 
  Let it wander as it will;	 
Call the jockey, call the pander,	 
  Bid them come and take their fill.	
 
When the bonny blade carouses,	 
  Pockets full, and spirits high—	 
What are acres? What are houses?	 
  Only dirt, or wet or dry.

&gt; **Transparency International considers Greece to be the most corrupt country in the EU**. Permits and certificates can only be had in return for cash. **Not everyone in Greece sees this as a problem. Some see corruption as part of Greek culture, and they also believe that taxes are unnecessary**. As a result, the government has a double revenue problem. On the one hand, the bureaucracy prevents some businesses from growing and becoming profitable. On the other hand, the businesses that do grow and realize profits find ways to pay almost no taxes at all. Every year, **the Greek state misses out on an estimated €20 billion in unpaid taxes.

I agree, the corrupt culture needs to change, but corruption levels aren't going to change in the short term. The idea that a country like Greece should stay as it is and not reform until it's gotten anywhere noticably less corrupt as a country is ludicrous. Elimination of corruption is a very long term task, and the Greek economic problems are going to get far far worse if they just ignore them and refuse to reform for the next 25 years.

&gt;They would rather close down their businesses than pay taxes.

&gt;Tax reduction or stimulation are actually part of every economic reform.

That would only be when taxes are high in the first place, which they were not (and in fact, still aren't particularly).

They're not getting out of that mess unless they actually start collecting significant revenue.

Every article I read about the Greek situation has me dumbfounded every time. They're always blaming everybody else, while a lot of these problems *were* created indigenous. 

As far as my understanding of the problem goes: Tax evasion was rife and an overabundance of government jobs were used as vehicles to suck up money for doing nothing at all. This caused *less* money to flow into the system because too few payed their respective taxes, and caused *more* money to flow out because of the huge list of people on the government payroll. Unsurprisingly, one day the bucket was empty and there was only the truth to face. Enter rage and aggression.

Add to that the fudged statistics and it becomes pretty hard to feel sympathy for them, as it just makes them look like bad liars who got caught. Especially if you see riots breaking out, and strikes because of announced austerity measures. What else do they think will get them out of this mess? It's just like a guy who's been living above his means and who finally has to face the bills he has to pay, but at a national level.

true,AgainstTheWind,EURO,European Union,"Large scale tax evasion, from what I've read, happens in the following way in Greece. A tax collector comes to check your business's books. They find something or they don't. In either case the tax collector asks for big money, in order to not plant stuff (so you give more money to the state) or to not say anything about the errors he sees, even if they are trivial (so again the same). So, you see that a businessman has no choice but to pay the tax collector, contributing to black money and tax evasion. This is the system that most tax collectors seem to work in Greece and the people can't do anything about it because if they do (let's say turn in the tax collector) then 1. the tax collector usually gets away with it and 2. the whole lot of tax collectors come crushing down on the businessman! :) So, as long as the government doesn't put it's own employees in jail, the people have no choice but to evade taxes. And you may ask, why don't their government put the tax collectors in jail? Well, this is easy. Because the greatest tax evasion comes from the politicians and major companies who have politician friends and of course the church, who owns half of Greece's lands and doesn't pay taxes at all!

I don't know how much French you can read. Basically, the contract, if attacked by the heir and found to be excessive, would be requalified as a donation (donations have to be reintegrated in the succession, so if you wanted to go that course and start distributing your wealth beforehand, that's not gonna work either) or as an equity contract (and thus would become part of the succession and split evenly between children).

In the cited case, the premiums equalled 82% of the whole patrimony done over the last two years of the life of a person who knew who had cancer.

So I guess ""excessive"" is up to the judge.
I don't know how much you want to exclude one of your children but if you do it in a too obvious fashion, then it's not going to work. Especially if you already use the ""part non reservataire"" for the other child(ren). If you on top of that, load the other heirs of assurance-vie, it's going to be obvious that you are trying to deprive one of your children of his/her fair share.

http://www.allofinance.com/dossiers/assurance_vie,_attention_aux_requalifications_120.pdf

*As soon as the prime is more than 33 % of the total wealth of the insured at the moment it is paid, this has **great chances** to be judged as excessive.
Conversely, if it less than 25%, the risk of requalification is very low.
It is therefore between 25% and 33% that judges will use other criteria.*

And no judge would be stupid enough not to notice if you loaded one child with the part non reservataire **and** an assurance-vie worth more than 25%.

So basically, if you want to be safe, then use the ""part non reservataire"" and a life-insurance that does not exceed 25% of the total to the favored kid.

That's France for you: equality. If you try too hard, you're gonna get caught. 

PS: I realised that I thought *you* wanted to do that, but you might be one of the heirs...

Africa is not one country, some areas are far worse than others. Greek corruption is bad, very bad. So is Italy's, so is Romania and Bulgaria and all the other old soviet countries. This doesn't mean all of these countries should completely stop reforming or changing or creating policy until it's fixed. Fixing corruption takes a very long time and is extremely hard (Which is why the vast majority of the planet is extremely corrupt, with only a handful of countries enjoying low corruption levels.

&gt;Economics is about incentives not about insulting others who don't behave on ways you think is right.

They can behave any way they want to, but if they refuse to do business just because they're going to be taxed then they're idiots. Taxation is inevitable, you have to pay it. If 10% of your tax money is being skimmed off the top by corrupt officials, that's a reason to combat corruption, not a reason to stop paying taxes.

&gt;And you assume that they have huge piles of money hidden in their homes (accumulated over years of not paying taxes) and that now they are being able to pay those higher taxes.

No, I do not, I'm quite aware that Greece hasn't been saving money up. However they are now going to have to deal with the taxation levels they have (still below the EU average, I might point out), because they're completely broke.

&gt;Almost their whole system is based on a huge public sector and austerity measures will cause huge poverty and more unemployment.

Probably, yes. But at this point the choice is not between no poverty and full employment against poverty and unemployment. It's between one option which results in less poverty and higher employment, and another option which in the long term will result in far more poverty and far higher unemployment.

The above article has flaws. For instance it compares US growth to Scandinavian, ignoring quite a lot of factors, and also ignoring that the simple reason the Scandinavians can afford to have the welfare states they do is because they have extremely high levels of taxation (which they actually pay).

The Greek economy must fundamentally change though, it can not continue to be one which relies heavily upon state employment and then fails to fund this through a lack of private sector and through a lack of taxing what private sector there is.

Their situation is not worsening every day though. In fact a few days ago they just had a 50% reduction in the debt they owe.

Here's my personal take on the ""issue"", this does not necessarily reflect anyone else's opinion (I'll probably get flamed by some of my fellow Greeks here):


I'm pissed at the current government since the focus of their reforms has been ""let's get everyone who was paying taxes before the crisis and get them to pay more taxes"", while at the same time being afraid to hunt the tax evaders. The Troika has some blame for this too since they only accept measures that have definite and measurable results and don't give a shit about fairness.


I'm REALLY pissed that even though I'm an educated and productive member of society who pays taxes, works at least 45 hours/week for a lousy salary, and even though most people I know are in the same situation (or simply unemployed), I/we get labeled as lazy and spoiled Greeks by anyone outside Greece, by guilt of association. 


I'm pissed at the civil servants and various other privileged groups for having the audacity to complain about their cuts. The only people who should be complaining are the unemployed and the productive citizens who have not contributed to the escalation of our debt, yet are being forced to pay for it.


I know there is no easy way out of this mess ...

- Economically:

-- Major cuts. People are getting fired. Paid less. Work more.

-- Money are not staying in the country (help in growth) but go out to pay loans.

-- Unpredictable environment (almost every week new taxes).


- Politically:

-- Powerless government (no actual economical authority. IMF and EU dictates what should be done).

-- Powerless alternatives (Major opposition has almost no different point of view in any subject -- not that it matters a lot)

-- People find no alternatives which leads to a growing political unhappiness.

-- No trust to democracy as it is felt right now.


- Socially

-- Everyone blames each other for the situation ==&gt; Social discomfort

-- Major strikes ==&gt; More discomfort, unpredictable environment

-- Occupied universities ==&gt; (undermine educational system)

-- Severe problems with books in primary and secondary education ==&gt; (they deliver pdf!!)

-- Severe problems with university professors (some of them are not paid/working anymore ==&gt; courses/labs not taught)

-- Hospitals without even toilet paper (and of course useful drags etc)


- Media

I don't believe I ever said dictatorship would be a viable solution to Greece's problems. I did say it's a viable option of government, although I did not say it is desirable.

&gt;So here's the thing:If you are such a scientist you should figure out that you are acting like a total technocrat asshole that has no value for human life.

Now why is this? Is this because I'm unsympathetic to violent people? Because I express anger at Germans being called Nazi's when the Greek bailout package is basically costing the average German citizen €1000 of tax money (at least for the time being). You seem to think I'm happy Greece is in a bad situation, or (I presume) that I have something against Greeks. I do not. I am sad that Greece is in such a terrible situation, and I desire it to get better. But I also get angry when people express their anger or discontent through petty violence, or via allusions which are not only clearly false comparisons, but additionally just downright rude.

Pour la fac de médecine tout dépend ou tu veux aller en france, à paris il y a plein de facs différentes (paris V, paris VI, paris VII, paris XII) et géneralement une fac par grande ville française, la plus ancienne étant celle de Montpellier qui est par ailleurs superbe.
Ensuite tout dépend de ton année d'étude. Dans ma fac (paris V) il y a tous les ans des étudiants qui viennent en erasmus 6 mois ou un an et ils ont tous un niveau différent (2 eme année à 6 eme année), ce qui est vraiment interessant c'est d'aller à l'hopital et ca ca se passe des la 4eme année, hopital le matin, cours l'après midi.

Dans ma fac la démarche est assez complexe puisqu'il faudra comparer ton cursus au notre et trouver quels cours sont et quels stages t'interessent. Les étudiants en erasmus sont plutot favorisés pour les choix de stages dans ma fac, ils ont tous les stages pour lesquels ont se bat !

No if Germany can overcome her objections then that is what will happen, it'll be made legal after the fact, ultimately the ECB wouldn't be doing anything different to what any other central bank does so it's not as if they're trying something completely new here.

My guess is if the ECB did begin to intervene with QE you really would get the amount of breathing space (we're talking years) within which it would be possible to hammer out a more permanent solution and meanwhile the ECB scaling back purchases in one particular countries bonds allows it to keep pressure on those countries who need to make the necessary fiscal changes.

BUT, that's not going to happen. The younger generations of Turks in Germany relate more to Germany than Turkey, and you'll see integration over time (though rarely call themselves German). Their birth rate will adjust to the same as the ""native"" Germans over time. A large majority of those Turks came from the gastarbeiter program, which stopped a while ago (though families of those gastarbeiters still came for years after). I honestly think you'll see the population of Turks stabilise over time, but they certainly will be a large minority.

Germany needs to implement policies like we have here in Australia. One of our ministers famously urged young parents to have 3 children, 1 for mum, 1 for dad and 1 for the country (though that sort of nationalism wouldn't go over too well in D-land these days). But the government promotes this with a 'baby-bonus', where you get a big fat cheque from the government when you have a baby. Germany needs this and they need to promote a higher birth-rate. It's their only way out of this mess. They need to stabilise their population, as going lower will only burden and contract the economy.

Die Tatsache, dass er nun ""ab und zu"" mal Hilfe vom Staat braucht um sein Fortbestehen zu sichern, ist sicher eingerechnet. Es basiert ja auf Jahrzehnten Vorarbeit. Generationen von geschmierten Vertretern der Legislative und Judikative. So spricht man von Lobbyvertretern an den entsprechenden Stellen, von Normalität. ""Das ist halt so"". Es scheint wunderbar zu funktionieren. Es ist auch nicht so als gäbe es nun einen Weg zurück. Man schaue sich z.B. UK an. Die können es sich einfach nicht leisten den Markt zu beschneiden. In Zeiten der Globalisierung ist jegliche Änderung zu Gunsten des Gemeinwohls wahrscheinlich eine einfache Rechnung die ergibt, dass es sich nicht lohnt.  

Moral oder Rücksicht braucht man nicht erwarten. Das System orientiert sich an Leuten wie Ayn Rand und lebt in jedem einzelnen Teilnehmer und die brauchen auch keine Aufklärung. Es ist ja nicht so als würden die ""Finanzjongleure"" oder Politiker nicht wissen was sie tun. Während dessen ist der Rest der Meute eher an Konsum und Tittytainmant interessiert.

true,lestratege,null,null,"Sorry, the ""prime"" is the premium paid to the beneficiary of the life-insurance contract.

I don't think the notaire has any obligation in whatever sense because the total amount of the premium paid through life-insurance will depend on how long and how much is paid every month. At the moment when the will is drawn the notaire has no idea how much the life-insurance will be worth at the death of person.
The role of the notaire is that all the legal **forms** are taken. I don't think the notaire who executes the will has any obligation in regard to one heir being screwed. The notaire is the counsel of the deceased, not of the heirs...

At the moment of the death, it seems to be a mess:
According to this: http://www.ordre-avocats-rennes.com/articles/Droit_Assurances/Droit_Assurances_3.htm

It really is upon the judges to decide whether a premium is considered excessive. There seems to be no guidelines and some contradictory jurdisprudence.

So it says that you can define a contrario an excessive premium. A valid premium would therefore be:

- if the premium is modest, ie, relatively to the equity and income and how and when it was paid.

- if the insurance contract is legitimate, in the sense that it is made as investment or to protect a family member, but it wouldn't if it is meant to screw one of the children.

According to the same page, the % of the total equity cannot be and is not the only criterion used to determine whether the premium is excessive.

So I think it is up to you to make a move. This is a civil issue, not a criminal one so there must be a victim in order for the judicial system to move. You have to complain. 

http://www.avocats-picovschi.com/les-contentieux-issus-du-contrat-d%E2%80%99assurance-vie-_article_522.html

Here it says: ""The success of an lawsuit to requalify a life-insurance contract [into an investment thus putting in back into the succession] will depend on the pieces of evidence that the client can provide: income and spending of the underwriter, his equity, bank statements, insurance company of the contract, date of the contract, date of death, beneficiary of the contract. Because it is necessary to be able to show the judges that the premium was excessive.""

In a word: gather all pieces of evidence you have, and go talk to a lawyer who will advise you and who will tell you if you have any chance to have the life insurance contract requalified. It's probably worth the 100 euros you're gonna pay towards the lawyer.",0,1319977648,null,0,true,0,c2vln6x,t3_lredd,t1_c2vln6x,t1_c2vglyn,1427802960,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

There are some smaller towns that are an absolute must: Chamonix and Annecy for example... I've always found that just about any small backwater village in France is going to totally trump any of the cities on charm.

I'm 100% in agreement with Herostratus on Strasbourg, and while you are there head into Alsace and visit all the villages (Ribeauville, Colmar, Riquewihr, etc.)

5k€ will get you a long ways in France in two month's time if you are careful with your budget. Look into a 2-month Eurail Pass before coming as well. 

I think it will be sheer hell trying to find an apartment for two months. I was shocked to find that my first lease agreement in France involved far more hassle and paperwork than it did to purchase a house in the US (or in France, for that matter...) If you happen to be here outside of ski season, there are tons of chalets in the Alps around the ski resorts that rent out for periods like that and are dirt cheap off-season.

I'm near Annecy if you need some help/tips.

Check out [this chart](http://voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/6335).

The reason the final product comes out of China is because mindless assembling is a very labour intensive process and China has a lot of cheap labour and people in the advanced countries are too well educated to waste their talents on just assembly. The Chinese don't actually make the design or any of the components that goes in the product; the advanced countries do that because they have the technology and the highly skilled labour.

This bill will be included in the normal bill of the electricity. So if you don't have to pay, they cut your electricity. This is an extra measure, apart from the money that all people are paying every year in the normal landed property taxation. So is this a lawful austerity measure?

I don't think you have the economics to back this up. Greece is already down so they don't have much further to fall. It might very well be in their best interests to crash and burn, get off the Euro and then recover. Argentina did something like this when they unpegged from the USD.

But this outcome would certainly *not* be in the interests of Germany. A Greece pull-out demonstrating to the bond markets that the EU and ECB aren't prepared to keep member countries solvent could lead to Spain, Italy and even France going next.

So in my opinion the reason why Greeks complaining about Germans/EU is whinny and wrong is that it's missing the point that its their own leaders who have decided to stick with the Euro.

If you want my honest opinion, I do think it's rather quixotic for a person to want to immigrate to the country and expect it to be easy for them without speaking the language fluently.

I did three years of high school German and then spent a year as exchange student in Berlin, and now many years later, I'm beginning to study the language again in earnest - building my vocabulary. I'm astonished at how poor my vocabulary is, even today. However, I definitely have a way forward, because I have a solid foundation in the grammar of the language.

It's true that most people you'll meet on a daily basis will use a restricted vocabulary of a thousand or so words to talk about everyday things. This is how it was possible for me to survive a year of immersion in Berlin with only three previous years of German classes under my belt. However, think about how frustrating it is when you were taking your first year university survey courses - trying to read textbooks without a complete understanding of the new vocabulary; there are holes in one's comprehension that are just really painful. This is what it's like, even for a person who's studied a language a good bit further than ""Rosetta Stone.""

To look out for our interests. It isn't a matter of speaking against Brazil, or India, it's about speaking for us. Individually, the UK has a population about a 20th of China, their GDP per capita needed only reach 1/20 of ours to be as economically powerful, and that happened a fair while ago. The largest nation in Europe, Germany, has a population of only 80 million, the smallest ones are less than one million. India isn't far behind China, and there are numerous other nations growing quickly behind them. Not to say that it's all plain sailing for those large nations, it isn't of course, but sheer size gives them a massive advantage as they climb out of poverty and into the first world.

&gt;  In the UK we have more in common with Canada, Australia, India, China than we do with many European countries. In Portugal they have more in common with Brazil....etc etc.

&gt;Capital calls

&gt;1. **The Board of Governors may call in authorised unpaid capital at any time and set an appropriate period of time for its payment by the ESM Members.**
&gt;
&gt;2. **The Board of Directors may call in authorised unpaid capital by simple majority decision to restore the level of paid-in capital if the amount of the latter is reduced by the absorption of losses below the level established in Article 8(2)**, as may be amended by the Board of Governors following the procedure provided for in Article 10, and set an appropriate period of time for its payment by the ESM Members.
&gt;
&gt;3. **The Managing Director shall call authorised unpaid capital in a timely manner if needed to avoid the ESM being in default of any scheduled or other payment obligation due to ESM creditors.** The Managing Director shall inform the Board of Directors and the Board of Governors of any such call. When a potential shortfall in ESM funds is detected, the Managing Director shall make such capital call(s) as soon as possible with a view to ensuring that the ESM shall have sufficient funds to meet payments due to creditors in full on their due date. ESM Members hereby irrevocably and unconditionally undertake to pay on demand any capital call made on them by the Managing Director pursuant to this paragraph, such demand to be paid within seven days of receipt. 

&gt;4. The Board of Directors **shall adopt the detailed terms and conditions which shall apply to calls on capital pursuant** to this Article. 

And
&gt;ARTICLE 4
&gt;
&gt;Structure and voting rules
&gt;
&gt;1. The ESM shall have a Board of Governors and a Board of Directors, as well as a Managing Director and other dedicated staff as may be considered necessary.
&gt;
&gt;2. The decisions of the Board of Governors and the Board of Directors shall be taken by mutual agreement, qualified majority or simple majority as specified in this Treaty. In respect of all decisions, a quorum of 2/3 of the members with voting rights representing at least 2/3 of the voting rights must be present.
&gt;
&gt;3. The adoption of a decision by mutual agreement requires the unanimity of the members participating in the vote. Abstentions do not prevent the adoption of a decision by mutual agreement.
&gt;
&gt;4. The adoption of a decision by qualified majority requires 80 % of the votes cast.
&gt;
&gt;5. The adoption of a decision by simple majority requires a majority of the votes cast.
&gt;
&gt;6. The voting rights of each ESM Member, as exercised by its appointee or by the latter's representative on the Board of Governors or Board of Directors, shall be equal to the number of shares allocated to it in the authorised capital stock of the ESM as set out in Annex II.
&gt;
&gt;7. ** If any ESM Member fails to pay any part of the amount due in respect of its obligations in relation to paid-in shares or calls of capital under Articles 8, 9 and 10, or in relation to the reimbursement of the financial assistance under Article 14 or 15, such ESM Member shall be unable, for so long as such failure continues, to exercise any of its voting rights.** The voting thresholds shall be recalculated accordingly.

If I understand this correctly, this *de facto* means that country looses its control over its own money.

EDIT:
&gt;ARTICLE 27
&gt;
&gt;Legal status, privileges and immunities

&gt;1. **To enable the ESM to fulfil its purpose, the legal status and the privileges and immunities set
out in this Article shall be accorded to the ESM in the territory of each ESM Member.** The ESM
shall endeavour to obtain recognition of its legal status and of its privileges and immunities in other
territories in which it performs functions or holds assets.
&gt;
&gt;2. The ESM shall have full legal personality; it shall have **full legal capacity to**:

&gt;   (a) **acquire and dispose of movable and immovable property;**
&gt;
&gt;   (b) contract;
&gt;
&gt;   (c) be a party to legal proceedings; and
&gt;
&gt;   (d) enter into a headquarter agreement and/or protocols as necessary for ensuring that its legal
status and its privileges and immunities are recognised and enforced.
&gt;
&gt;3. **The ESM, its property, funding and assets, wherever located and by whomsoever held, shall
enjoy immunity from every form of judicial process except to the extent that the ESM expressly
waives its immunity** for the purpose of any proceedings or by the terms of any contract, including
the documentation of the funding instruments.
&gt;
&gt;4. **The property, funding and assets of the ESM shall, wherever located and by whomsoever
held, be immune from search, requisition, confiscation, expropriation or any other form of seizure,
taking or foreclosure by executive, judicial, administrative or legislative action.**
&gt;
&gt;5. The archives of the ESM and all documents belonging to the ESM or held by it, shall
be inviolable.
&gt;
&gt;6. The premises of the ESM shall be inviolable.
&gt;
&gt;7. The official communications of the ESM shall be accorded by each ESM Member and by
each state which has recognised the legal status and the privileges and immunities of the ESM, the
same treatment as it accords to the official communications of an ESM Member.
&gt;
&gt;8. **To the extent necessary to carry out the activities provided for in this Treaty, all property,
funding and assets of the ESM shall be free from restrictions, regulations, controls and moratoria of
any nature.**
&gt;
&gt;9. **The ESM shall be exempted from any requirement to be authorised or licensed as a credit
institution, investment services provider or other authorised licensed or regulated entity under the
laws of each ESM Member.**

So they put laws into place that make it illegal for Germany to own nuclear weapons and operate an army suited for effective offense (as opposed to defense from the Soviets).

Laws can be stretched, but with Germans generally being opposed to war, this can threaten re-elections and make governing quite ""unpleasant"".

After the initial conflict is over, I guess an intervention would not have been a bad thing.

En fait, les majors ont deux solutions pour choper les vilains petits pirates de lainternet:

- La méthode TMG (et ils sont beaux, eux, les adresses IPs collectées étaient lisibles en clair sur leurs serveurs 
-négligence caractérisée quand tu nous tiens- ce qui est un délit passible de 3 ans de prison et d'une amende assez coton) qui consiste à soit mettre un fichier ""appât"" sur un réseau de p2p ou plus simplement à partager un fichier déjà disponible pour récupérer les IPs des vilains petits pirates. Un peu comme un policier qui se mettrait à vendre de la drogue pour interpeller les consommateurs (et aux dernières nouvelles, non, ce n'est pas un moyen légal d'arrêter des contrevenants)

- le DPI, avec la participation des FAIs: on scanne tout le trafic, et je rappelle que l'IP fonctionne sur le principe du contenant et du contenu. Le contenant, c'est les informations de transit du paquet (de quelle IP il vient, à quelle IP il est adressé, etc), et le contenu, c'est le message. Et si on scanne *tout* le trafic, ceci inclut les emails, les conversations sur IRC ou messageries instantanées, les jeux vidéos, reddit et tout le reste. Tout ça pour choper les petits malins qui s'échangent le dernier CD de la enième resucée de la Star Ac', ça fait un peu beaucoup. On peut toujours voir le DPI à l'œuvre dans un pays comme la Syrie, avec les conséquences que de tels outils peuvent avoir sur:

- La [Neutralité du réseau](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralit%C3%A9_du_r%C3%A9seau)

Contre laquelle nos chers gouvernants s'acharnent depuis quelques années. En nous sortant l'argument imparable du ""c'est pour lutter contre les pédonazis pirates d'internet"". Cette blague, les pédonazis en question, ça fait bien longtemps qu'ils cryptent l'intégralité de leur trafic, au grand dam des policiers et gendarmes qui traquent ce genre de sinistres individus.

Ensuite, sur le lien que tu fournis, je cite:

&gt; Et à chauqe connexion votre FAI vous fournis une nouvelle adresse IP. En voici une : 192.168.1.10

ahem… 192.168.x.x, c'est du réseau local, en gros l'ip fournie par ta box à ta machine *localement*. Ça fait pas très sérieux, et la suite de l'article est à l'avenant. Mais je pinaille.

Après, évidemment, une bonne partie du trafic p2p s'est reportée sur les solutions d'hébergement à la Megaupload (et ses pubs popup pour des sites bourrés de malwares, ou des sites de phishing, au passage) - et que veulent mettre en place les ayants-droits pour régler ce ""problème""?

But we have good schools for foreign people who want to learn German. My aunt learned German in such a school and her English is okay. Not very good but she doesn't speak a lot and her English was better when she lived in Germany. 

German and English are very similar (I'm only used to BE. If AE has some special stuff the Brits don't use in the grammar, it could be different) because they are based on the same language. Sometimes, you really can translate stuff word by word.

If you want to work in Germany you've got to keep in mind you have to pay a lot of taxes if you aren't married. But you can get a lot of financial support. So keep also in mind that you don't have to buy for the doctor and if you loose your job you will get financial support and you maybe don't have to save a lot of money to be secure.

Really important is the fact that we don't like plastic money. Most of the time we pay cash and even in some restaurants you can't pay with CC or debit cards. It is not normal that you have a lot of credits in Germany. Of course sometimes you can't avoid.

Maybe the biggest difference between USA and Germany: We normally don't talk about war and most of the time we deal with it like ""it just happens and we don't really care"". Actually, a lot of soldiers say that they don't feel supported by the Germans for ""saving our country""...

true,int_0x80,FRNK,Franken,"&gt; 1) How do you feel about your health care system? I understand its the oldest universal healthcare in the world!

In general, I have no complaints.  Some doctors I've been to don't seem to like their job very much, which makes me not like being their patient very much, but that's probably true in every country.

&gt; 2) What type of fees do you experience for being on the public health system?

7.5% of my pre-tax income each month goes to my public insurer (and my company pays the same amount as well, so it's quite expensive).  From there, the only other fee is €10 per calendar quarter if I see a doctor.  And prescriptions cost money sometimes, of course.

&gt; 3) What are the Ups and Downs, so to speak, of choosing the private health insurance providers instead of the government?

I am eligible for private insurance, but I chose to stay with public for two reasons:

* I am young and healthy and I would rather that my health insurance money go to support a system that helps people who are not young and healthy (private insurers, of course, are careful about who they cover).
* If my girlfriend and I have a child, she and the child can be added to my plan with no additional fees.

&gt; 4) How often is is that someone chooses the private sector over public?

I don't know.  People usually choose private because it's cheaper, or because they want the better access to doctors that private insurance provides (private pays more to doctors, so private patients get single-bed hospital rooms, and faster appointments).  But I know a lot of people who *could* choose private who stay with public because they're planning on having children.  And once you switch to private, AFAIK you can't switch back to public.

But most people don't actually get to choose.  You need to make more than €49,800 a year to even be eligible for private insurance.

&gt; 5) How easy is it for you to see your general physician for a check up or if you have a cold?

Very easy.  Every weekday of the year aside from holidays, I can go  to my GP between 1300 and 1800, wait an hour or two, and be taken care of.  If I am too sick to leave the house, he is willing to visit me.

&gt; 6) Can you see the doctor the same day or right after you make an appointment?

I can usually get an appointment with my GP for a few days later (or just walk in and wait, like I said).  For specialists, it's a little more difficult.  I had to see a foot doctor earlier this year, and several doctors I called didn't have free appointments for several weeks.  For the even more specialized doctors, I'm sure that I would have to wait a month or two for an appointment if it wasn't an emergency.

&gt; 7) Do you typically make an appointment or do a walk-in? Which is more generally accepted?

I don't think specialists allow walk-ins, and I usually make an appointment with my GP so I can specify that I want to see him, rather than one of the trainee doctors who are in charge of handling the walk-in patients.

&gt; 8) How easy/hard is it for you to contact your physician?

Very easy.  They even have an email address.

&gt; 9) After answering these questions, what changes do you wish to see in your healthcare system?

We need more doctors, and it can be frustrating to find a pharmacy that is open on a Sunday (even things like Aspirin can only be sold in pharmacies, so one must plan ahead).",0,1320039581,null,0,false,0,c2vsjld,t3_lunl4,t1_c2vsjld,t3_lunl4,1427806754,14,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,14

true,alphager,null,null,"&gt;1) How do you feel about your health care system? I understand its the oldest universal healthcare in the world!

Pretty good, actually. I think that we could improve some things ( I would prefer making state-provided healthcare mandatory and private healthcare be something on top of that; private healthcare providers should not be able to only pick the cheap clients).

&gt;2) What type of fees do you experience for being on the public health system?

Fixed percentage of my income (up to the Beitragsbemessungsgrenze), 10€ each quarter I see a doctor.


&gt;3) What are the Ups and Downs, so to speak, of choosing the private health insurance providers instead of the government?

Ups: It's cheaper, you get preferential treatment (you don't wait half an hour to see the doctor; you get a free glass of sparkling water) and some treatments (like homeopathy and massages) are only available at private healthcare providers.
Downs: It gets expensive the older you get. It gets *really* expensive the older you get. Once in there, you can't switch back to the governmental one (except under certain circumstances).

&gt;4) How often is is that someone chooses the private sector over public?

Only possible for someone making more than 50'000€/year. Those that make more often chose to switch, though it makes sense to stay in the governmental plan (you don't pay for children &amp; non-working spouses with the governmental plan. I could switch, but won't.).

&gt;5) How easy is it for you to see your general physician for a check up or if you have a cold?

Easy as dropping by and wait ~30 - 60 minutes (or better: call ahead and get an appointment on the same day), IF you live in a city. I've got 3 general health practitioners within walking distance. On the countryside, it get's more complicated.

&gt;6) Can you see the doctor the same day or right after you make an appointment?

Yes, no problem with the GP. For specialists, it's different. 

&gt;7) Do you typically make an appointment or do a walk-in? Which is more generally accepted?

I generally make an appointment, because a cold is not an emergency that requires treatment right *now*. Both is general practice. Usually, the doctors don't make appointments for the first two hours of their opening times (usually starts between 8 and 9) so the people who just have gotten ill can drop in unannounced and get a medical dispensation from work for that day (or the next several days, depending on the illness). After that it's by appointment (and drop-ins whenever there is time).

&gt;8) How easy/hard is it for you to contact your physician?

Walking distance, available by phone.

&gt;9) After answering these questions, what changes do you wish to see in your healthcare system?

Don't make it possible for rich people to get out of the government's plan completely. Cancel the Beitragsbemessungsgrenze (there's no reason someone with a 100'000€ income should pay the same amount as someone with a 50'000 income).

It is true that we fear what we don't understand (and that made us better at surviving as a species, so it is a selective trait), even if it may be highly unlikely to pose much of a threat.  However, the fact that we only recently learn stuff like [how rice RNA affects gene expression](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2011/09/21/what-you-eat-affects-your-genes-rna-from-rice-can-survive-digestion-and-alter-gene-expression/) is a bit unnerving and begs the question of what else we don't know.

It's good. Especially if you keep hearing stories about the American system (no offense meant).

&gt; 2) What type of fees do you experience for being on the public health system?

8.2 % of my gross income goes towards public healthcare system, my employer pays 7.3% (it used to be 50-50, but that's changed since 2009 ([source](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesetzliche_Krankenversicherung#Beitragss.C3.A4tze_und_Verteilung_der_Beitragslast)). There's also &lt; 1% each for the long-term care insurance (""Pflegeversicherung""). Plus there is € 10 per quarter if I see a doctor (""Praxisgebühr"").

&gt; 3) What are the Ups and Downs, so to speak, of choosing the private health insurance providers instead of the government?

Private insurance covers more treatments and tests, so doctors can bill more to private patients than to publicly insured patients. So privately insured patients tend to get higher bills and end up subventioning the healthcare system (except for doctors who only accept private insurance). Since public insurance fee is coupled to income but private insurance is fixed, there comes a point where private insurance may be cheaper than public insurance if your income is high enough. However, it can be difficult to switch back from private insurance to the public system.

&gt; 4) How often is is that someone chooses the private sector over public?

Higher income tends to favour the private sector. However, everything that int_0x80 said applies.

&gt; 5) How easy is it for you to see your general physician for a check up or if you have a cold?

No problem at all. 

&gt; 6) Can you see the doctor the same day or right after you make an appointment?

That depends on your doctor... if your doctor is popular with patients and has a lot of them, it may be difficult. If you want to see a specialist, probably not (but then you tend to not go to a specialist out of the blue). General pracitioners will try to slip you in.

&gt; 7) Do you typically make an appointment or do a walk-in? Which is more generally accepted?

I try to make appointments since it reduces waiting time. I think appointments are more generally accepted.

&gt; 8) How easy/hard is it for you to contact your physician?

Telephone during business hours.

&gt; 9) After answering these questions, what changes do you wish to see in your healthcare system?

Young doctors are paid very badly, which drives a lot of them away.

government insurance : cheaper: e.g.: married couple decides to get private insurrence. soon they have children and one of them has to leave work due to the children. now one income has to pay for 3 private insurances!
upside: you are more forced to use the system how it thought to be: you are ill, go to your general practitioner (GP). he decides wether to send you to a ""Facharzt"" (Radiologyst, Cardiologyst, Pneumol... ). When you are in government insurance you have to go to your GP to be transferred to a Facharzt. Otherwise it will cost you another 10€ to go there.. In private insurrance you can go to a Facharzt without paying 10€, thus, for example, leading to an imense amount of perfeclty healthy knees in an radiologist office. after a ""football sunday"" everybody ""just wants to see"" why their knee hurts. A GP would say: just rest your leg, cool it down and wait for 1 week. if its not getting better: we'll take the next step! :D
4) How often is is that someone chooses the private sector over public?
When you have the chance to choose over the private sector, you do.
5) How easy is it for you to see your general physician for a check up or if you have a cold?
No problem in my area (lower saxony)
6) Can you see the doctor the same day or right after you make an appointment?
If you are really sick, sure you can. otherwise go to a ""Notaufnahme"" in the hospital
7) Do you typically make an appointment or do a walk-in? Which is more generally accepted?
I never just walked in,i make an appointment. Walk-in only in case of an emergency 
8) How easy/hard is it for you to contact your physician?
No problem, just call and ask for the doctor ;)

true,ambitiousbutrubbish,null,null," I share your point of view, but would like to add something. Greeks were surprisingly friendly with Germans after WW2 (considering the magnitude of destruction and loss of life, it took us a  short time to forgive and forget and Germans have been pretty much admired in recent years, not hated). 
 
 What made the old hate resurface can be traced, imho, in a few key things. The German (tabloid) media. Frau Merkel and her holier than thou attitude and people like the German ambassador to Athens who said that Germany does not recognise the war loan made to nazi Germany by the occupied Greece's puppet government to the nazis. (not the reparations, the loan that comes up to tens of billions of today's euros and this after Greece was part of the 50% haircut in favour of Germany in early 50s) 

 It doesn't take more than this for a vocal minority to start calling nazi!, etc..

 Again imho, the random Greek citizen who is not necessarily extremely well informed, views the current situation as: My government and local corruption rings fucked up, in cooperation with Germany and EU (Siemens scandals, institutions that handed out loans cannot be deemed braindead at the time and knew what they were doing, etc). We now take huge loans (un-haircutted) to cover our loans, making the total debt skyrocket. The loans are all going towards paying banks and making sure Germany retains its export market and favourable position within the EU. And on top of these ""enslaving"" loans, Greeks (those of us who have been lawful all these years) are asked to pay more and more taxes (to the point of paralysis) while every economic index is going down and the market is in one word dead. 

 A lot of things are lost in translation. I would like to see a poll with whaat Germans and Greeks think about the bail out. I think there will be opposing views and only a minority will see it for what it is: A bank bailout.

I am a student and 24 years old, which means I am co-insured with my parents with no additional costs.

In addition to alphager:

&gt; 5) How easy is it for you to see your general physician for a check up or if you have a cold?

If I call them first, they generally give me an appointment the same day. Most of the time within the next 4-5 hours. Then I'll have to wait for ~10 minutes before the doctor can see me.

&gt;6) Can you see the doctor the same day or right after you make an appointment?

Two weeks ago I went to my doctor and he diagnosed me with hernia inguinalis - I needed surgery, but it was not acute, I quote ""you can wait with the surgery for half a year, if you want - not a problem"". He referred me to the hospital, I got an appointment there (had to wait one week), then they scheduled my surgery to be eight days later.

In my opinion that's pretty fast for a ""nice-to-have"" surgery.

&gt; 7) Do you typically make an appointment or do a walk-in? Which is more generally accepted?

Also see 5. I always call first. The preferred way depends on the doctor/receptionist. If you don't mind waiting a little longer, you just go.

&gt; 8) How easy/hard is it for you to contact your physician?

I live in a little place on the country. The next doctor is 400m away. If I am really sick, I call and he comes to my home.
If he is not available, I need to drive 10km tops, to find at least three other doctors. 

edit: So it's very easy. Give him a call and you'll see your doctor within a few hours.

&gt; 9) After answering these questions, what changes do you wish to see in your healthcare system?

See alphager's answer. That pretty much sums it up.

some additions:

&gt; 7) Do you typically make an appointment or do a walk-in? Which is more generally accepted?

walk-ins are always allright for a GP. in fact, i don't think i have ever made an appointment there. 

with specialists, it really depends. if you need a CT done, you will definitely need an appointment, same for psychiatrists (except for emergencies, obviously). if you have skin problems and go to a dermatologist, that's probably allright. 

the first time you visit a doctor within 3 months you pay 10 eur. if your first doctor is that specialist, s/he will charge you. if you need to go to another doctor within three months, you can a) pay again 10 bucks there, or b) get a transfer from that specialist to the GP, who then will give you another transfer to the specialist. the idea is that people are encouraged to always see GP first, who should decide which specialist you need to see.

&gt; 9) After answering these questions, what changes do you wish to see in your healthcare system?

* institutions should work much better together. for instance, there is practically no team work between psychiatrists, psychotherapists, mental hospitals and social workers (people with severe psychological disorders will probably see every one of these institutions from time to time). 
* we need a lot more doctors, and they have to be educated about the practical skills needed to be a good doctor much earlier in their study
* big pharma is a huge ripoff even here. prices for pharmaceuticals have to drop sharply. they are not justified by the (admittedly) huge costs of research and development of new treatments.

if more money could help witht the first two issues, i would personally gladly pay more for my healthcare. it has to be organised within the public plan, not within the private industry. i strongly oppose a two class healthcare, which in parts we already have.

I really can't complain. Sure the system isn't perfect, but I usually can get all the heathcare I need without going into debt.

&gt;2) What type of fees do you experience for being on the public health system?

As I'm a student and earn less than 400€ a month, I am covered under a family-insurance, I do not pay for it directly.
If a student earns more, he can get normal healthcare for 64.77€ a month if I'm not mistaken.
Other than that you need to pay 10€ per quarter year if you visit any doctor.

&gt;3) What are the Ups and Downs, so to speak, of choosing the private health insurance providers instead of the government?
Most people choose a private insurer to get access to more expensive treatments and preferential treatment. (There are some doctors that only take private patients, for example.)

&gt;4) How often is is that someone chooses the private sector over public?
I really don't know. Most people with private insurance are either self-employed or state employees 

&gt;5) How easy is it for you to see your general physician for a check up or if you have a cold?

I call to ask for an appointment and usually get one for the same day or the next one. If it's urgent, I will get squeezed in somewhere on the same day even if he's got not free appointments.

&gt;6) Can you see the doctor the same day or right after you make an appointment?
For my GP, no problem. For specialists, it can be a bit more complicated and you may have to wait for a few weeks, if it's not really urgent.

&gt;7) Do you typically make an appointment or do a walk-in? Which is more generally accepted?

I usually make an appointment. No point in sitting there waiting.

&gt;8) How easy/hard is it for you to contact your physician?

I can call between 8:00 and 18:00 (I think).

true,Britzer,null,null,"I am still a little surprised at the war. Gaddafi had made good contracts with all P5 (permanent five) members of the UNSC. Thus ensuring that any attempt at a resolution against him would get a veto from one or more. He gave us oil and gas and bought weapons from everyone. He also commissioned a whole city to be built by the Chinese. 

I am a little confused about that. The only reason I can think of why NATO got involved is that everyone thought the Rebellion would be strong enough to last for a decade long civil war. A decade in which it would be difficult to exploit the natural resources of Libya. Germany gets most of it's oil from there, because it is very clean, as opposed to the sulfur shit that the Americans buy from the Saudis. 

So NATO decided to end the conflict ASAP and chose to side against Gaddafi. It would have been rather easy to side with Gaddafi as well. Just deliver weapons and satellite pics of the Rebellion's positions. Like we did in 1991/1992, when we helped Saddam crush the Shia uprising in southern Iraq.

It's okay, if you have a severe condition, you get a lot of help.

2) What type of fees do you experience for being on the public health system?

If you dont have any money, it's being payed for, when you work you pay a certain percentage 7.5% (and the employer pays the same). you have to pay then 10% of every costs you have, like drugs and every 3 months you have to pay an one time fee for the doctor, if you visit him. those cost cannot exceed 2% of your overall income, if you are really sick this limit is 1%, so i have only to pay 89€ a year for my health care and i get my mediaction and treatments which are super expensive and costs thousands of thousands of euros each year.

3) What are the Ups and Downs, so to speak, of choosing the private health insurance providers instead of the government?

To choose private health care is not up to you, you have to a) be self employed or b) you make over 50000€ a year.

You get a single room in the hospital and you get faster treatments, because doctors make more money with a private patient, but if you are sick, your costs can be very high, because you have to pay for every treatment before you can get your money back from the insurance. also a private insurance can turn you away for no reason, public can't.
If your healthy and rich, the private sector is your choice, because public helathcare gets really expensive when you make a lot of money.

4) How often is is that someone chooses the private sector over public?

87% are public 13% private

5) How easy is it for you to see your general physician for a check up or if you have a cold?

i see my doctor about every 4 weeks and i also get gymclasses and paintreatment and a maid comes every week to help with shopping and cleaning.

6) Can you see the doctor the same day or right after you make an appointment?

depends, with an appointment, you dont have to wait so long,but you can come in without an appointment.

7) Do you typically make an appointment or do a walk-in? Which is more generally accepted?

i do walk-ins. if you go to the dentist for example, you should have an appointment, the doctor you see if you have a cold you normally just call and tell them that you pop by.

8) How easy/hard is it for you to contact your physician?

I do it with an email. So it is very quick, but it really depends on the doctor.

9) After answering these questions, what changes do you wish to see in your healthcare system?

Purtroppo no, per quanto fosse stato uno dei miei primi tentativi in fase di test. In realtà un modo ci sarebbe, ossia creare per ogni singolo utente un'immagine personalizzata contenente due icone, aggiungerla allo sprite contenente tutte le icone che usiamo qui su r/italy, e scrivere una linea di codice solo per quell'utente. Ulteriore problema sarebbe il fatto che per lasciar spazio a queste due icone dovrei modificare lo spazio a destra dell'username di tutti gli utenti, ottenendo uno spiacevole effetto nell'impaginazione (quelli senza 2 icone avrebbero molto più spazio di quelli con una).

Ad ogni modo, apprezzo molto la proposta!

&gt; How often is is that someone chooses the private sector over public?

The German system generally gives you the possibility to leave public health care only if you earn more than a certain amount of income. Since the German (public) health care system has a progressive premium, this is pretty stupid, because it essentially lets all the high incomes out of the system and leaves the burdon to the middle incomes. But private health care is still not all that popular. It is mainly a system for state employees with tenure (Beamte), which make up the largest group of people in private health care. State employees used to not be eligible for public health insurance, because it was tied to the employer. 

Private health care used to have better benefits, but that has gradually changed. Now it is just a slightly different system. Were it not for the industry, we could scrap the private system tomorrow.

&gt; Can you see the doctor the same day or right after you make an appointment?

This depends on your doctor and how severe your case is. I have always been able to find a doctor on the same day. But I live in a big city. Here we have lots of physicians. It is much worse in the coutry, where we have very few doctors per patient.

&gt; After answering these questions, what changes do you wish to see in your healthcare system?

From a scientist point of view there are always little changes that could be made. But since the system is public and we also have smart people working at the public health care insurance companies, they are always trying out new things. Currently they are looking at better information sharing among different providers to prevent redundant tests.

Personally my biggest pet peave is understanding motivation and applying that to payment. Pay for performance sounds great, but recent motivational research has shown that people work different. And especially for people working in health care the primary motivational factor doesn't seem to be monetary compensation. At least not in the research that I have read. Pay for performance is currently the biggest thing in health care and if you focus solely on that you will lose more than you gain IMHO. Because it will frustrate far more people to a greater extent than motivate some people to perform better.",0,1320071242,null,0,false,0,c2vunp6,t3_lunl4,t1_c2vunp6,t3_lunl4,1427807749,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2
