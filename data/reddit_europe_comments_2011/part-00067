true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"Grand plans are grand PR. Real life is an iterative process where progress is made by taking small continuous steps. This is not only true with the EU and the current crisis in the Eurozone, but also with other countries and crisis. For example Finland had even worser depression in the beginning of 90s than Sweden, and the way the country came out of it wasn't based on some long term plan, it was based on putting out small fires and surviving into the next day step by step. From the point of view of today, the policy decisions may seem to have some grand design behind them, but in reality they didn't, it was luck that correct decisions were made and even more luck that we had Nokia that pooled the country into new growth.

What goes to Eurozone, there can't and shouldn't be any grand plan to settle the mess in Greece. The reason is simple, let me quote Donald Rumsfeld...

&gt;There are known knowns; there are things we know we know.
We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we don't know we don't know.

Thus to make a grand plan is setting one to fail as there are too many things we don't know and too many unknown unknowns. Instead of hashing out an grand plan, we must truest ourselves on the historic tradition of the EU, that is discussing about problems and solutions to them, taking iterative steps and when ready, making bigger changes. That recipe has worked for the last 60 years and transformed Europe being what it is.

And lastly, if the Eurozone crashes it will take the EU with it, and it will not be rebuilt, it will be replaced by inward looking nation states engaged to nationalism instead of internationalism or globalism. In a worst case scenario, the brake up of the EU will take the whole world economy with it and launch a new era of protectionism crashing the global trade. The only way out of the crisis is to build upon what we already have and continue on the road of integration - there is no other way.",0,1319488788,null,0,false,0,c2u406x,t3_lmtvb,t1_c2u406x,t1_c2u0p26,1427777217,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

It seems to be almost inevitable that this will take place within the core of the euro membership. In essence although we don't yet realise it the EU as was is dead and the eurozone is now the future of europe, I expect that many of the countries not presently in the eurozone will wish to join when the current problems are worked out (I am assuming they will be, eventually.).

But I personally have a deep gut feeling that I am not european in the sense that many on this forum believe themselves to be, I intensely dislike the way that the EU is run, the european parliament seems to me a joke, the european commission a power hungry bureaucracy whose every solution to every problem is to attempt to centralise within itself more power.

So ultimately with the eurozone integrating whatever influence we have over the course of the EU will wane to the point where I believe there will be little point in being inside it anymore, better off to just leave and get on with it.

- Social security system: When a immigrant comes to Belgium, they can immediately start a request to receive a permit to stay here. Meanwhile the law obligates the country to take care of these people. If the government cannot provide food, shelter and basic needs, it is obligated to give each person the money to provide for themselves. Once a person receives a permit to stay in our country, they can send over their families because we have a law called ""family reunion"". These people will automatically receive a permit. Btw, if you have a permit, you receive a so called ""living fee"", that is actually a monthly amount of money that is the same as a minimum wage (+- € 1000, add about € 200 per child).

- Steppingstone to the rest of the EU: Many immigrants come over here to make their way to another EU country or Great Britain.

I don't consider myself a racist, but I do admit that I'm angry at our government for allowing this country to go to shit. Simple example: A Romanian family comes to Belgium. They receive an apartment to stay in for free. One person requests cable, electrical and water distribution. He does not pay. The law says that you can only disconnect this person after 6 months of not paying. After 6 months, they disconnect him and the next person (brother, nephew, ...) requests the same distributions at the same address. The companies are obligated to connect these people.

Our logic goes like this, in order to fix the euro the eurozone will need to integrate, it will need to do this as an act of survival. We've already seen an example of this with the Financial Tax that's being proposed, if the EU cannot pass it (Britain will block it) then it will affect the eurozone only.

Expect much more like this, many laws and regulations which we will find impossible to support but which the eurozone feels is necessary to survive will be passed, at which point what is the point of the EU? Europe will be made up of countries in the eurozone, those who wish to join the eurozone and perhaps a few countries like us that have no desire to be part of an integrated eurozone.

We have basically believed this since the creation of the euro, history has shown that no currency union has ever worked on its own, fiscal integration has always been required, which is why we never joined. The question was never ""Would you like to use the euro single currency?"" to us it was ""Would you like to be part of a federal europe?"" because ultimately the one would inevitably lead to the other and if you joined the euro you'd have no *choice* in the matter. Economics would compel you to federalise.

Do I like the speed at which the EU is moving ahead? No, there's very little effort been made to convince people that this is for the best the referendums showed that even on the continent people still feel like they're being swept away by the European project.

We're only behind Germany in terms of net contributions (including Thatcher's rebate!) and a great deal further ahead of the next largest contributor, France.

Britain is a net contributor to EU because Britain is among the wealthy contries in Europe.

Britain is also a large country so it is no surprise that Britain is among the top contributors, but per inhabitant Britain is much further down the list of contributors; Austria, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden all pay more per inhabitant than Britain. Despite people from Netherlands and Sweden are paying more they have less voice in EU than people from Britain. Britain should be grateful for the favorable position it has in EU as being among the three largest countries. 

&gt; Further, why do I get the impression that your idea of ""working together"" is to do whatever France or Germany wants?

You mean as opposed to little Britain (12% of EU inhabitants) should be the one to decide what decisions are taken in EU? 

Britain can propose its ideas and if they can build a majority, the British proposal will be chosen. If not Britain will follow the decision of the majority, so is democracy.

&gt; I think some of you Continentals need to gain some perspective here. Britain to a significant degree helps bankroll the EU. Don't throw a hissy fit like a three year old when Britain doesn't go along with whatever cock and bull story is coming out of Brussels this week.

British people like you suffer from some sort of island fever, but that is no excuse to act as a spoilt baby here. For cock and bull stories go read your Daily Mail, Telegraph and Sunday Sport.

EU is 500 million people, Britain is just 60 million. The world does not revolve around Britain. The empire disappeared more than 60 years ago. I know that British people are a nostalgic lot, but I would have expected British people to realise that the world has changed. Britain together with EU can have a large influence on the world scene, but Britain on its own will be of little relevance. 

&gt; Also, ""decimated"" in the Latin sense is probably the best word for any Scotland breakaway, that has a cat in hell's chance of happening anyway. The whole of Scotland has a population less than that of London.

I hope Britain will stay together, but I see the feelings in Scotland are strong for independence.

Err, no.  Britain is such a large contributor to the EU because the UK pays in far more than it takes out.  As I said, we are comparing net contributions.  Economies of similar sizes, for instance France and Italy, do not pay as much to the EU *in net* as the UK does.

&gt; Britain is also a large country so it is no surprise that Britain is among the top contributors, but per inhabitant Britain is much further down the list of contributors; Austria, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden all pay more per inhabitant than Britain.

You are playing fast and loose with statistics here.  It does not matter how much *per inhabitant* these countries pay in, if they are taking back large amounts of money from the EU.

&gt; Britain should be grateful for the favorable position it has in EU as being among the three largest countries.

An incendiary statement.  Britain should be ""grateful""?  To who, exactly, should we be grateful?

&gt; Britain can propose its ideas and if they can build a majority, the British proposal will be chosen. If not Britain will follow the decision of the majority, so is democracy.

Alternatively, Britain can use its veto to act in its national interest.  Don't like it?  Talk to your democratically elected leaders who agreed to giving Britain a veto.  As you say, that's democracy.

&gt; British people like you suffer from some sort of island fever, but that is no excuse to act as a spoilt baby here. For cock and bull stories go read your Daily Mail, Telegraph and Sunday Sport.

They're our worst newspapers, yet surprisingly are an order of magnitude better than the bilge you get on the Continent.  Tell me, by the way, what's Luxembourg's premier newspaper?

&gt; Britain together with EU can have a large influence on the world scene, but Britain on its own will be of little relevance.

What ""relevance"" do you crave?  What ""relevance"" do the British crave?  As a Luxembourger, do you crave a unified EU in order to give your country some relevance --- a feat it could never achieve on its own?

&gt; I hope Britain will stay together, but I see the feelings in Scotland are strong for independence.

Once Gaddafi started bombing the rebels, the no-fly zone happened to put a stop to it.

As we know, the participating countries then went a fair way beyond that mandate. We bombed tanks and buildings, I seem to recall we sunk ships, and there were some pretty strong indications that the British had deployed special forces operators to train the rebels (and God knows what else).

We admire European food, culture etc. most of us holiday in Europe; if there's any other language we speak it's a European one. Europeans can expect a pretty good reception if they visit. Problems with the EU should not be conflated with problems with Europeans or European countries. Yes, the Sun will mention the war when England play Germany at football, but the next day the match is over.

The problems with the EU basically boil down to:

1) The EU is more liberal than the right wing in our country; therefore right wing voters don't like EU ideals and institutions; such as maximum working week hours, human rights act (!) etc. Centrist and left wingers *do* like these things.

2) Many (I'd say most) people don't want to lose the British currency, both for practical reasons and nostalgic ones. This often gets mixed up with anti-EU sentiment, because nobody's quite sure if, long term, you can be one without the other.

3) The EU is a confusing mess of organisations. People fundamentally don't understand how it works. This leads to misunderstandings and also gives it an unrepresentative feel. This is not uniquely British; there's a reason so many countries voted against the EU constitution. The EU, if it is to move forwards, desperately need to reform.

4) Finally, there's a suspicion that the EU will be dominated by France and Germany, who will carve things up in their own interests, and that everyone will always side against Britain out of spite. Which is pretty stupid and paranoid; and yet has a grain of truth (see Sarkozy).

For people who actually mean it it's generally a change in attitude among politicians (yeah, fat chance, I know), honesty with constituents about the choices we have and the move from intergovernmentalism (who's the ones meeting behind closed doors again?) towards true federalism with a parliament and government that take their strictly limited powers directly from the people.

But for this to happen, there needs to be an honest discussion and hopefully the realization among people that it is in fact the best way forward. There has to be a change in people's knowledge that national and EU government belongs to them and with it a change in identity.

Part of that is misinformation, but part is in my opinion valid- there's no particular reason why there be any European agricultural or fisheries policy, and the expense of one and the futility of the other is baffling. I also think the EU has a tendency to overstep its remit on legislative powers. I have no problem with European laws about interroperability, standards, etc, and I can understand the trade-off of a single market as against social protections. But where something falls outside of those areas it should be in general be left to national parliaments. The standards also have to be sensible, not grading bananas on their curvature.

true,rif,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Err, no. Britain is such a large contributor to the EU because the UK pays in far more than it takes out. As I said, we are comparing net contributions. 

What error? These are net contribution. As was stated in my last posting:

- Britain is a net contributor to EU because Britain is among the wealthy countries in Europe.

- Britain is also a large country so it is no surprise that Britain is among the top contributors, but per inhabitant Britain is much further down the list of contributors; Austria, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden all pay more per inhabitant than Britain.

&gt; You are playing fast and loose with statistics here. It does not matter how much per inhabitant these countries pay in, if they are taking back large amounts of money from the EU.

Of the listed countries which country would that be? The countries listed are all [larger NET CONTRIBUTORS PER INHABITANTS than Britain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_the_European_Union#State_by_state_analysis).

&gt; An incendiary statement. Britain should be ""grateful""? To who, exactly, should we be grateful?

To the countries that pays more per inhabitants than Britain, but also to the rest of EU for giving Britain a larger voice on the world scene than it would otherwise have on its own.

&gt;Mehr als die Hälfte aller betroffenen Bischöfe ließ nicht einmal den Eingang bestätigen und beantwortete auch einen später nachgeschobenen Brief nicht. Die Antwort aus dem Erzbischöflichen Ordinariat in München war gar zynisch.

Keine Überraschung - wenn es um Geld und Macht geht, war die katholische Kirche schon immer höchst irdisch eingestellt.

Erinnert sich noch jemand an den Skandal um die [Banco Ambrosiano](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Ambrosiano), oder das vatikanische [Istituto per le Opere di Religione](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istituto_per_le_Opere_di_Religione)?  

&gt;Eine Bank auf den Bahamas, die Cisalpina, spielte dabei eine Schlüsselrolle. Die Bank diente offenbar der Geldwäsche, um Kokaingelder aus Lateinamerika mit Hilfe der World Finance Corporation in Miami in die legalen Finanzmärkte einzuschleusen. Die Cisalpina wurde neben Calvi von dem Erzbischof Paul Casimir Marcinkus verwaltet, dem Chef der vatikanischen Bank Istituto per le Opere di Religione, die ihrerseits an der Ambrosiano beteiligt war.

But you guys have to see; we are more or less proficient in the English language and in the German one, which means we more or less immediately recognise when something's bad.

Again, I am humbled.. and I would like to thank you all again for everything you are doing. Do not let this sick propaganda get to you -- it is only meant to create divisions which would cause real problems for the euro.

The euro has provided all of the members relative price stability and purchasing power. Cyprus had a stronger currency than the euro (1.71 euros per pound), and looking back I believe if they had not joined the euro they would have had to devalue the currency to remain ""competitive"" for tourism and exports... this would have made the country lose a lot of real purchasing power while giving the illusion of having more money. I think the UK made a big mistake that they didn't join the eurozone from the beginning. They have had to devalue the currency to ""remain competitive"" and when this ""crisis"" blows over, Cyprus will be proof that the UK made a mistake by not joining. Again, THANK YOU for supporting the euro!

What I think some Greeks don't understand is that if they were to go back to their own currency, it would become devalued very fast and would give the illusion that there is more money and more jobs, but the money will be worthless. It seems Germany is trying to give them an opportunity to remain rich (purchasing power in the global sense) right after the situation is under control. In this sense they are like a drug addicted cousin which you are trying to help stop the drugs and right now they are in withdrawal so they start screaming at you -- but one day they will understand that you were only doing it for their own good.

I only hope Zypern will manage to impress you guys in the near future when they begin generating revenues from oil and natural gas. It's a small country, it has had its issues (due to cyprus banks allocating half of their money to give loans to Greece -- funny.. you would think Greece would have been the one giving money to Cyprus). It seems the problem is coming under control as instead of shamefully asking the EU for monetary help next year, Russia will give them a loan at very cheap interest rates (probably in exchange for allowing them to have some gas field contracts.. but you know..

Britain, on the other hand, would have additional funds in the state coffers, and would politically be in the same position as Iceland and Norway, both of whom are doing rather nicely outside of the EU.

It would seem that when I did the calculations a few days ago, they came out in this order: Spain, Germany, France, UK, Italy.

I will give a quick comparison of Spain vs UK for more or less the same parts:

Destination Country: Cyprus (15% VAT)

Amazon UK (20% VAT)
----------------------

Samsung S22A350 (seems very similar spec to BX2235 and shows up in that search with the best price): £114.99

Intel Sandybridge i5-2500K £168.80

PNY nVIDIA GeForce GTX560Ti OC XLR8 850MHz 1GB 256BIT DDR5 2xDVI MINI HDMI PCI-E Graphics Card £169.99

Total: £453.78

Remove VAT: 453.78 / 120 * 100 = 378.15

Convert GBP To Euro (using Google): 378.15 British pounds = 432.449432 Euros

Add Cyprus VAT of 15%: 497.32

Add Shipping: It would come out to approximately 10 GBP or so for Standard 3-10 day delivery.. so lets say 11.50 eur

Total: 508.82 euros

Amazon ES (18% VAT)
-----------------------

Intel BX80623I52500K 180.92 euros

MSI N560GTX-Ti Twin Frozr II/OC 183.02 euros

Samsung SyncMaster BX2235 134.52 euros

Total: 498.46 euros

Remove VAT: 498.46 / 118 * 100 = 422.42 euros

Add Cyprus VAT of 15%: 485.79 euros

Add Shipping: 19.99 euros in this case for Express 1-2 day shipping

Total: 505.78 euros

Well, I don't know where you got that link, but it doesn't show what you think it shows. It only shows *steady* decline for the United States and Russia. For everyone else but China, it shows about as close as you can get in the real world to steady-state. In addition the graph shows we have ~5% of global output, for a fraction of the population of the larger nations at ~25%. Excellent news. Thank you for sharing :-)

Only in the North Sea, which as I pointed out is not our only source of oil. And unlike Norway, we thankfully don't have all our eggs in one basket :-)

Go take a [tour of the Rotterdam Harbor](http://spido.nl/trips/tours/rotterdam-harbour-tour?id=1089#p696) if you like ships and big machinery.

In Haarlem you'll find [the oldest museum of the Netherlands](http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/index.php?item=1&amp;lang=en). In this museum you can sort of see how stuff was presented in the 18th and 19th century, mostly natural science and art. It's very interesting and the museum is gorgeous.

The entire article is about how a bigger EU budget would not ""benefit the peoples of Europe"". However, the matter is supposedly totally different when national parliaments can decide:

&gt;&gt;It should be for the elected and accountable national parliaments throughout Europe to decide if they do, or do not, want a Tobin tax following rigorous debate about the pros and cons of this policy.

As I've said, if the author were fair, he'd apply the same criteria to European and national institutions.

&gt;The British like strong governments that can make decisive decisions in times of crises. Perhaps that's why the UK's system has survived almost intact over the last three centuries, whereas the majority of Europe have lurched from one form of government to another (often with disastrous results).

The facts do not support the conclusion. You could make the same argument of stability about Sweden, only are Swedes used to minority governments. May I add that Sweden has significantly better human development figures than the UK (and the UK is in fact the worst western European country in this regard).

At age 28 work brought me to the US for the first time.  Generally with my work, we travel a lot as our clients are major corporations dotted over the whole of the US.  So in 14 nights, I'll be in about 10 different cities and states. I've repeated this every year since, and I'm now 33.

The first time I visited the US was to Chicago.  It was a Sunday in March and it was wet, windy and the city was empty.  There was *nobody*, it was like a ghost town.  I think it was national holiday of some sort.  I was shocked at how bad the city seemed, particularly in my inexperienced mind when I compared to it Tokyo.  We got some train from the airport hotel to the city centre and I was genuinely scarred, with guys looking like they were in a gang of some sort shouting and swearing with some girls.  

The trip didn't seem to get much better; every city we visited seemed run down and dilapidated.  There seemed to be no atmosphere, everywhere seemed to be dangerous to walk, and we even stayed in a Holiday Inn in Philadelphia that had a warning not to open the doors to staff before phoning the reception as there had been armed robberies.

But every year I've gone back on my own, I've tried to see more.  I stayed with a friend in New York on memorial day and it was brilliant.  I also started getting over to California more, which is really like another country.

It's not obvious at all.  For instance, the UK has unilaterally enforced much tighter banking regulation than the EU legislation was suggesting, including a complete ring fencing of investment and retail banking.  Given the EU's track record of complete and utter failure in regulating financial matters (for example, the geniuses in Brussels getting hoodwinked by outrageous Greek lies on the state of their economy, prior to their acceptance into the Eurozone), I'm far more comfortable with banking regulation being administered by Britons.

Further, EU banking regulation is a trojan horse.  The French are forever trying to drag away some of the banks from London to Paris (c.f. recent ruckus over clearing houses dealing in Euros).  Best not give them any more ammunition to use to meddle in our affairs.

You're also now babbling about gerrymandering, despite you not providing any evidence that this is occurring, and all constituency boundaries being in the hands of a quango and out of government control.

Further, you're still pushing the idiotic idea that the only democracies are those that elect their parliamentarians with some form of proportional representation (re: comments about ""representation"").

&gt; I know what the House of Lords is, but I also know how often a Parliament Act actually occurs.

Well, the Parliament Act is hardly used because it is rarely ever needed.  Most Acts pass the Lords, and so the Act never needs to be invoked.  Further, the House of Lords can only stop a bill from passing for a total of three times before they're constitutionally required to allow it through.

So, for those who actually understand the UK's set up, the rarity of the invocation of the Parliament Act isn't actually a surprise.

&gt; Whether gerrymandering occurs is ineffectual to the argument of legitimate representation.

Um, it's pretty relevant to your claim that there's widespread gerrymandering in the UK.  Are you now trying to back away from that claim, admit you're talking shit, or are you going to stick with it?

&gt; I'm not shocked. It's just not very democratic, and you shouldn't use it as an argument to the ineffectualness of European institutions.

It's perfectly democratic.  The person who can command the largest group of voters who are confident in their ability to do the job gets elected.  Further, FPTP is the only electoral system, to my knowledge, that doesn't exhibit pathological outcomes, like the various methods of PR and their failure of monotonicity.

I did claim no such thing. I claimed that, along with the (undoubtedly widespread) tactical voting, it needs to be considered as an additional effect to the fact that many British MPs are elected by plurality but not majority and thus don't represent their constituents. This is the core of the argument, and your picking around the periphery how things may be bad but aren't actually too bad (and really, who cares about separation of powers), leaves that untouched.

Sure, and unless the US and the Asian economies implement it, the only effect is to drive banks out of Europe.  No thanks.  There's a whole world outside of Europe.

&gt; I did claim no such thing. I claimed that, along with the (undoubtedly widespread) tactical voting, it needs to be considered as an additional effect to the fact that many British MPs are elected by plurality but not majority and thus don't represent their constituents.

Well, for it to be considered an ""additional effect"", you have to first show that there is any gerrymandering present in the British system in the first place.  You haven't.

&gt; This is the core of the argument, and your picking around the periphery how things may be bad but aren't actually too bad (and really, who cares about separation of powers), leaves that untouched.

Well, you're a fine one to talk about picking pieces of argument to address.  How many points have you raised and dropped now, like the silly aside about the use of the Parliament Act, the House of Lords, the PM and Royal Ascent, etc. all of which you've failed to understand totally?

But, to address your point, I don't really care about separation of powers, no.  Perhaps you can enlighten me as to why I should?  I have an idea it's going to be a ridiculous hypothetical situation, like where some tyrannical leader takes over the country but is somehow stopped in his tracks by a constitutional separation of powers.  To which I reply: ""lol"".  Further, why are you lumping ""separation of powers"" and ""democracy"" together?  The two are orthogonal issues.

&gt; I have answered, though in an edit (before your post).

Um, what's your point with respect to the Human Rights Act?  It's just the British embodiment of the ECHR.  All countries have some protections in place, either through a constitution, or laws passed via the government.  You don't think your country's (which is, once again?) constitutional protections were handed down by God, do you?

I have the feeling you don't really know what you're talking about, and just throwing random shit out, based on bits and pieces, and half truths, or summaries of complex matters, that you've read about elsewhere, hoping it will stick.

This was before I knew anything about American politics and before the internet was ragging on violent cops every minute.

It was just a feeling that rampant militarism had seeped into the daily running of society.

It seemed that when anything vaguely unusual occurred, something off-script -- protests, loud music, out-of-state tags on a car, people arguing in the street, someone climbing a tree -- the police would magically appear wearing dark shades and with one hand on their holster.

The police here in Ireland receive a generous amount of criticism, but I have to say that at least here you have some hope of accessing their humanity -- even in response to public disturbances they try to assume the perpetrators are just idiots taking a joke too far -- ""would ye ever calm down lads!""

At the time I just put it down to there being a flight from Mexico that had come in just before mine and maybe the reputation made border control act all weird. Last time I flew to Miami I had the same flight, which seems to always come in at the same time as that Mexico flight, and I think I was waiting in the queue for the best part of two hours. (I could be completely off the mark with my assumptions here, I'm just working off of stereotypes I've been subject to for years. I would assume that they treat every flight the same. As of now, I'm pretty sure it's because that guy was a massive douchenozzle).

It seems so, I flew into New York with little to no problem. Whizzed through border control. Maybe I'll get a connecting flight next time and go to WPB or Fort Lauderdale...
