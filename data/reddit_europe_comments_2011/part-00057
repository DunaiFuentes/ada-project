true,originalthoughts,null,null,"Yea, main thing that the entry in the Schengen will do for Romania/Bulgaria is allow their citizens to work legally in Schengen without the need for working permits (some nations already don't require working permits for Romania/Bulgaria).

The thing Europeans are worried about is the immigration which might come from the non EU countries like Ukraine and Moldova. Once they get into Romania or Bulgaria, they'll be able to get to the rest of Europe with no more borders. The EU simply doesn't trust the border control in Romania and Bulgaria to control this problem.

Romanians can already travel to Europe without a problem. The border controls are similar to how it was 20 years ago between Canada and USA, they just do a quick glance at ID card (no need for passport) and are waved through. They stop and control other nations though at the borders between Romania/Bulgaria and the Schengen countries, helping limit the number of immigration from outside those countries.

true,originalthoughts,null,null,"I can tell you things have changed dramatically in the last 4 years. I am born in Canada, with Romanian parents, and now am doing a PhD in Germany. I have travelled through Eastern Europe a lot the last 10 years, some 3-4 months per year. The first time I took a bus from Romania to Germany, we were asked to pay into a fund to bribe the border guards between Romania and Hungary and Hungary/Austria. At each stop, 3 to 5 people were asked to get off the bus and had to pay a bribe of around 100-300 euro. I've been across those borders around 50 times since then and slowly it's gotten better, and I can tell you that now, this no longer happens.

I have also been to Moldova/Ukraine and Romania a few times. The first few times, the border was a joke and obviously corrupt. I can tell you that the last two summers I went however, they checked EVERYONE's luggage thoroughly, like opened everything up, the car/bus, etc... They were very thorough. Things have definitively changed. I'm not saying there isn't corruption, but it's certainly improved.

You can also see the politicians. Romania went from having former communist party officers (Illescu) as president and from having crazy mayors (Funar in Cluj) to electing a much better political class. Although it's not the best, and you do have some idiots who get through (Becali to the EU), it's miles ahead of what it used to be 10 years ago. As is pointed out in a post below, Italy and Greece are no better than Romania and Bulgaria in terms of corruption. Italy has Berlusconni who has gotten away with the most ridiculous things in power (changing the law to avoid being convicted for example) some 50 times. 

The economy of Romania, their GDP, is around 5x what it was 10 years ago. The avg salary went up around 5x too. I think those are solid improvements, please show us some studies that show that since 2007, they've been severely lacking... Did you know that Romania was the fastest growing economy in Europe for 3 years in a row (might be 4) from around 2004 to 2008? The unemployment rate is under 10%, compare that to Spain which has over 20%.

Romania and Bulgaria are seriously working against corruption too, maybe a bit more pressure won't be bad, but this is really screwing things up for honest Romanians and allowing dishonest Romanians to keep doing their thing. 

As for the tulip thing, who knows what exactly happened and the truck(s) was let through the same day. Other countries are way worse than that, look at Dubai imposing 1000 dollar visas on Canadians (some 5-10x higher than for anyone else), because Canada didn't want to give them more landing rights for their planes. Canada even had to close their military base there because of that. Also, Canadians didn't need a visa before that. In any case, it's certainly not cute.

Anyway, just having to present and ID is different than a passport. Getting an ID card is much easier (well it's the law in almost every EU country) than getting a passport. There are no endorsements and restrictions on an ID card. I'm not even sure if they check the criminal data bases when you use an ID card. They never even check my Canadian or Romanian passport in the system usually, they just have a quick glance and a stamp, not scanning or typing on the computer.

In any case, in Europe everyone is supposed to carry ID on them at all times by law (not the case in Canada/USA). They are also required to have it when travelling across borders. Denmark recently started checking all car passengers entering recently.

This is just one more reason as to why it makes no sense. Since Romanians can already easily travel around Europe (much easier than a German travelling to the USA, or even for a Canadian travelling to the USA), why not get rid of the final formalities and worry about the external borders. I like the Polish proposal of doing a 2 step integration by first allowing air travel without borders (Romanian/Bulgarian flights don't land at Schengen terminals/terminal areas right now) and then implementing it for all borders.

While 4-5 years ago you could easily bribe your way through everything at both borders, hell, you could just make a good joke sometimes and they'll ignore minor things like 100 new shoe boxes in the bus or that a person has 20L of vodka or 20kg of cheese. 

This however, no longer seems to be the case. The borders between the East and Romania are much tougher now, I go through them often. 

That's not to say you can't still bribe your way through, but it's certainly more than a little bit of money now.

true,alexchuck,ROMA,Romania,"ok, here is my take on it. IAMA 28-year old Romanian, I lived in Italy for a period of time and now I'm in the USA.

Romania and Bulgaria had to secure their borders in order to be accepted in the Schengen zone. This was the condition stipulated in the agreement with the European council for security. So Romania and Bulgaria bought expensive technology and know-how from the Germans, the French and the Dutch and secured their borders. For example, Romania spent a couple of billions of euros, which is quite a lot, especially in times of recession/financial crisis. Then, inspectors mandated by this ""security council"" started analyzing the progress done and reported back. ** The reports were positive. Romania and Bulgaria did their job and respected the agreement.** 

However, some big players in the European Union still didn't want Romania and Bulgaria in Schengen. First it was France and Germany and they said justice and corruption are the causes. Poland, who holds the EU chair, convinced France and Germany to let Romania and Bulgaria in. But now, Holland and Finland are against it and use the same arguments. **Decisions about the Schengen zone must be unanymous, so it's enough for one single country to be against a decision for that decision to be rejected**. Is this the best solution two developed countries can find? Honestly, it looks very childish, something taken out of some cheap classical novels. If you are that smart, why don't you find a smart way to deal with the issues? It's 2011 and I think politicians should act accordingly.

I just want to say, justice and corruption were not specified in the agreement and it's really hard to quantify them. This is definitely a made-up reason and it's nonetheless political. Look who's governing these countries - right-wing anti-immigrationist parties (like ""the true Finlandians"", or that Dutch politician that made the documentary on Islam and is currently under fatwa). No further comments on this one, I'll let everyone research and judge.

The decision taken by Holland and Finland is very non-European. Yes, we understand  you guys have a really good opinion about yourselves and your civilizations. But don't forget that while you were building your empires, we were here, in Eastern Europe, protecting your asses from all the other empires and armies that were trying to invade Europe: barbarians (including huns), the ottomans and the russians. Not a single fuck was given from Western Europe, while we were exposed to a permanent stampede. We've always been attacked and our villages were always burned down and looted. Romanians have never tried to expand, to attack or threaten another people. And we are damn proud of that. When the gypsies moved to Europe from India (4-500 years ago), they stopped in Eastern Europe first because they did not feel the need to go any further. Now that we have, somehow, gotten poor and they moved to Western Europe, all I hear from you is whining and complaining. Learn how to deal with it or if not, just stop saying you believe in United Tolerant Europe.

Ever since Romania was accepted in the EU, many Romanians went to work abroad. And they did a great job, because they are hard-working professionals (in constructions, IT, public relations, etc) and it's a relatively cheap workforce. Also, many countries starting ~~investing~~ buying Romanian businesses. Holland is the number 1 investor in Romania and is planning to buy the Constanta seaport (one of the largest in Europe) while Finland opened a Nokia factory. So isn't it right for us to say something like ""Scumbag Holland/Finland. Says you're not ready yet for Schengen zone but still abuses Romanian workers and consumers."" ? Why is nobody talking about this? We are real, not some figment of your imagination you can use to improve your self-esteem. And you know, some European countries had to take real measures to relaunch the economy. For example, in Romania, state employees accepted a cut of 25% in their salaries and an increase in the VAT from 19% to 24%. Nobody liked it, but people understood spendings have to be cut. No offense, but I cannot imagine that happening in the Western Europe even if the skies were to fall. There will be come a day when someone or something will take this into account and we will be on the good side of things.

I used to appreciated Holland as I see it as the greatest civilization in Europe. But now son, ""I am disappoint"". Please, Dutch people, don't take this personally, but  politically. I understand your worries about non-European nations invading Western Europe but we, in Central/Eastern/Southern Europe, are more European than you could ever imagine.

However, I was told (by the same insurance broker) that health expense invoices that come to you **have** to be paid in full **by you**, and only then you send the invoice and proof of payment to the insurance company. Then, the insurance company decides if and how much of that amount will be reimbursed to you as per your insurance contract.

First of all: don't panic. You always have at least 30 days to pay (regardless of what it says on the invoice) before any legal action can happen at all. In practically all cases, even after 30 days they will only send you a Mahnung (reminder).

The total amount is 2076,33, the ""E-Preis"" does not matter. I would assume it will be covered as there was clearly a medical indication.

Just stay off the main boulevard where all the sex shops are, leading up to the Moulin Rouge. Of course, we DID go for walks there at night, but if you're with a woman the barkers outside the sex shops don't harass as badly. The sex shops are pretty funny to see if you're not used to seeing window displays full of sex toys where you're from :) 

If you want to carry camera gear, get a bag that has the zipper on the inside, towards your back. We have one made by Lowepro. Just be careful and be wary when you take it off to remove gear.

Don't make eye contact with these types or they will never leave you alone. 

Most of all, don't get yourself too worked up over safety concerns, you'll spoil your trip. Vacations are for relaxation and to have a good time.  Just remember to be aware of what's going on around you, like you would in ANY populous city, and everything will be fine.

c) Hallo? Es geht mir um die Inhalte auf PI. Prinzipiell habe ich überhaupt nichts gegen die Finanzierungsform über T-Shirts. (Der Blog ist offensichtlich populär, sonst wäre er auch nicht Rede wert. Was die Sache nicht besser macht.)

Die Schweiz ist wohl eher der Fluchtort vor der deutschen Strafverfolgung. 

FYI: Hier geht es nicht um einen ""politischen Gegner"". Auf welcher Seite Volksverhetzung betrieben wird ist mir sowas von egal. Dem Verfassungsschutz offenbar auch:

&gt;
&gt;Schon seit längerem widmet sich das Weblog ""Politically Incorrect"" (PI) dem selbsternannten Kampf gegen das Böse in der Welt, das die Betreiber vor allem in der vorgeblichen Islamisierung des alten Europa erkennen. Führt schon die Lektüre der islamophoben Texte im Blog bei neutralen Lesern regelmäßig zu erhobenen Augenbrauen, gilt das erst recht für die Kommentare. Die nicht enden wollenden Litaneien wüstester rassistischer Beschimpfungen und Mordphantasien so mancher PI-Fans ließen es den Blog-Betreibern angeraten sein, die Seite im Ausland zu hosten, sicher vor dem Zugriff des deutschen Rechtsstaates.
&gt;
&gt;Der hat aber dennoch ein Auge auf das Treiben, wie jetzt Sebastian Edathy, SPD-MdB und Vorsitzender des Innenausschusses mitteilte. Auf Anfrage erklärte der Politiker, er habe den Präsidenten des Bundesamtes für Verfassungsschutz wegen des Blogs angeschrieben. Der Verfassungsschutz habe ihm mitgeteilt, ""dass 'PI' dem Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz bekannt und im Blick sei. Die weitere Entwicklung werde beobachtet"".

b) Wir haben über das m.E. nichtexistente ""Geschäft mit dem Hass"" gesprochen, nicht über Rassismus. Nebenbei ist Islamophobie kein Rassismus, d.h. die Ablehnung einer ethnischen Gruppe, sondern die Ablehnung einer religiösen Gruppe.

Es wird hier kontextfrei über den Shop gesprochen, wobei der Kontext der feilgebotenen Motive, die eben sehr, sehr neutral sind, vollständig ausgeblendet wird...

Ich würde mir sowas nicht ins Regal legen, aus anderen Gründen, aber wenn ich es würde, wäre das ein Zeichen, daß ich islamophob wäre?

War Mozart (""K-A-F-F-E-E"", ""Flucht aus dem Serail"") ein Rassist?

For some reason they seem to think that their default would be better than the austerity measures, but anyone with any knowledge of a country defaulting knows that greeks have seen absolutely nothing yet in terms of hardship. There was widespread looting and pillaging in Argentinia, after weeks of no supply with basic living necessaties. Greeks will find themselves back in the stone age without water, gas, food or electricity, can kiss their pensions goodbye and will dream of having a job.

OTOH three years after the 2008 earthquake the banks should definately be prepared for a default. After all, the greek default has been looming on the horizon for about a year now. If the banks haven't written off their loans to Greece yet (and still have an ok balance sheet) than they are stupid.

But the world has turned upside down. Greece was saved by Germany (via the EU), because it was a freakin' bank bailout for German banks. And it looks like they didn't stop playing in Greek bonds even though they were bailed out. Which is how they are bancrupting the rest of Europe because managers like their bonuses (and Greek bonds have huge returns right now). Mind you, not Greece is bankrupting anyone, but our banks are. A default wouldn't even mean that 300 billion Euros are lost. The article is a little bs on that. A default would mean that Greece won't be able to pay the full amount plus interest, but will stop paying interest and start negotiating how much they will pay back on their loans. My guess is that even if Greece defaults, they would still agree to pay back more than half (150 billion Euros).

And at the same time, no one seems to tell the Greek people just how bad a default would be for them. That's some responsible Greek politicians, ain't it?

In dollars, that would amount to $0.000000031 in dollars of 2011. That's one less zero than the $0.0000000023 from late 1923, when, btw., you would have needed a million of those bills if you wanted to send a letter. Or, at a very generous 25% p.a., interest rate, it would have accumulated to *almost one dollar* by today.

As mentioned earlier, we can also go via the gold mark. The nice thing about it is that, for purposes of building insurances, there is still an official exchange rate that reflects the cost of construction in a given year, relative to a fictive gold mark of 1914. It also has a weight equivalent in gold, and there is a conversion rate for purchasing power based on the gold mark in 1914.

Your 10.000 paper marks at the end were worth 0.000000001 gold marks (official exchange rate). The fictional gold mark for insurance purposes is worth €15.40, so that's €0.0000000154. By the purchasing power of a gold mark in 1914, this would be only €0.00000000417 (one third of the building insurance value).  
If we go by weight instead, then that's 0.0000000035842g. Today, that much would cost $0.0000002.

A quick outline:

There always have been ressentiments against one common European policy. Our politicians and governments of the past decades all have missed the opportunity to clearly communicate the underlying ideas and benefits of the European Union. The reason? These ressentiments among the populace.

The EU became accepted during the economical boom of the past few years, which, unfortunately, has been sold to the German middle-class as an isolated triumph of the German economy by Her Awesomeness Chancellor Merkel; for obvious reasons.

So, now, that other countries want ""German"" monies people start wondering what went wrong. 

The answers and conclusions vary greatly throughout the population. The most interesting sample, as I think, is the group of conservative voters. Some seek relief in turning back the time and isolated sovereignty - they blame Europe. Others, and this is a rapidly growing group, know they have been deliberately fed with incomplete information all the way - they blame our politicians. Hard-liners of both sections want our chancellor staked.

So, Capt'n Angela Merkel is navigating the troubled waters of the day after with no plan on what to do, just waiting for the end.

Concerning the German public opinion:

Everything is chaos thus of minor importance. All the ideals are just tattered words. Germany is looking for the soul that could provide help. We're just one more disenchanted generation.

Secondly and quite obviously, said diplomats are not going to allow their name to be quoted when no deal has yet been reached so they are merely quoted as ""sources"" because otherwise they would not talk off the record with the journalist in question. This is no doubt being done to soften up the euro area populaces to the idea that Greece is going to default while at the same time preventing any particular politician or diplomat for being blamed for leaking this information early.

This is common practice in British papers because if they didn't quote off the record sources then the public would frankly be completely in the dark.

Finally Greece is going to default because it has too much debt which it cannot pay back, it cannot pay it back because it has been in permanent recession for 3+ years and the level of austerity imposed means paying it back is impossible.

true,mstfuplx,GREE,Greece,"Firstly, the persons referred to as ""diplomats outside and inside the eurozone"" are quite obvious who they are and that does not need an explanation. The reason i used that phrase in my first comment was the following :

The article's main title is worded as this: ""EU officials expect Greece to default but stay in eurozone"". No specific source was given apart from mentioning the diplomats' belief that Greece will default. I sarcastically alluded to the lack of specificity. 

Regarding your explanation for the lack of sources, that may as well be the case. Allow me though to be extremely skeptic. There is no valid reason to believe what a journalist states without sources. 

As for the Greeks defaulting, i don't want to be pendantic but Greece is not in recession for 3+ years, it will be though. For the years 2004 to 2008 Greece had an expanding GDP. From 2009 onwards Greece sees its GDP decreasing.

As for the austerity measures, those have one purpose only. Greece has a budget deficit. In other words, Greece spending excheeds its income. If Greece manages to get a surplus deficit then it could be possible to pay the lenders back. Let's also not forget debt restructuring.

The reality as I perceive it is that confidence is decreasing in the ability of the eurozone to manage this problem, the first indication of that was the decrease in the stock price of the French banks, the second is the withdrawal of the American banks from the european money markets (they no longer trust the european banks or have any means of assessing how trustworthy those banks are).

This is the gradual loss of confidence in the banking system which leads to the entire system seizing up, that process is taking place now and once it's begun it cannot be stopped, or patched up until the underlying problem is solved.

The lynch pin of that problem is Greece, with the banking system slowly shutting down there is not enough time for Greece to gets its finances in order so it must be tackled, the only solution that is viable within the time frame available is default and recapitalisation. Everything else is just words, not action and action is what is required at this point.

Further, the new Euro currencies will likely have the same problems as the now extant Euro.  In short, within a year or two we're likely to see the Drachma and co. being resurrected.

If you remember the downgrade happened on Friday, after the markets closed, and on monday stock prices plummeted at -5% worldwide. When exactly did American banks withdraw from the european credit market?

You refer to time limits but you are not specific. When and what exact event is going to trigger the Greek default ? 

If that happens, there will be  a domino of financial events that ,except for Greece, will set Portugal, Spain, Ireland and most propably Italy a century back in progress. The amount of Greek debt the CEB, the French and the German banks have is enough to force many of the banks to recapitalise if Greece defaults.

Besides, that would mean a huge loss for said banks. Don't forget Greece owes not only to the previous lenders but also to those who gave the bailout money. This would essentially mean : Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Spain will default. In no way, shape or form would Germany/France bailout those countries after losing a huge amount of money to Greece.

We essentially agree that the consequences are going to be dramatic but the difference is you take it for granted that Greece will default. I am not so sure. There is also the chance of debt restructure. What this means is that the lenders will renegotiate with Greece and agree to a reduced debt. This would also mean a loss for the lenders but a higher chance for Greece to pay back.

Your last paragraph contains a plausible theory. But the treaty could take place without the default. The only country i see as a big obstacle for that to happen is Italy.

The problem is Germany's already heading towards a recession anyway.  Moving to a stronger currency will just push the whole economy over the edge.  Are Germans really prepared to fuck their own economy up like that?

&gt; 2) Half a year ago, we were told Greece could be saved, now they are insolvent. Spain and Italy are - they tell us - saveable. I am not a political economist, but I have my doubts.

Well, perhaps Greece could have been saved half a year ago if decisive action had been taken.  Instead, what we saw was a whole lot of bungling from Eurozone politicians, idiotic demonstrations in Greece and unions threatening to scupper any plans that the Government had to increase revenue (i.e. electricity workers refusing to implement property tax increases that would be incorporated into electricity bills) and a crippling level of austerity forced onto the country that had a massive contractionary effect without much outside help to counteract this.

Saying Greece can be saved is not saying that the way that the Eurozone went about attempting to save Greece was the right way.  With a bit of intelligence, both Italy and Spain could be saved.  But, if they aren't, I can't see how we will exit this recession for the foreseeable future.

Of course I can only speak for myself, but it is a common view in the German population that we have been in an economic crisis since the mid-90s, and that any boom times only benefitted the industry, but not the population. In fact, our real wages have been consistently diminished in the last twenty years. Many Germans would let the whole system crash rather today than tomorrow, believing in ""Besser ein Ende mit Schrecken, als ein Schrecken ohne Ende"" (better a horrific end, than an endless horror).

&gt; Well, perhaps Greece could have been saved half a year ago if decisive action had been taken.

And what makes you believe we will see decisive action in Spain (where the youth is on the streets and strikes are just around the corner) or Italy (which is almost synonymus with ""nepotism"" and ""corruption""? Better play it safe and let them crash.

&gt; But, if they aren't, I can't see how we will exit this recession for the foreseeable future.

And I have met a lot of people in the UK who are fairly annoyed at the increased dominance of Webster's bastardized and lazy English. 

OTOH, the planet clearly needs a *lingua franca*. Many languages have filled that role. Today it's English. Tomorrow, I suspect it will be some kind of horrible pidgin with English and Indian and eastern stuff thrown in. It doesn't really matter (except to the likes of me, who like nice and clean languages, who are going to face horrors yet undreamed of). As long as the message gets through.

And since I now move on to ""resentful of for whatever reason"". If I may suggest another correction, it would be to replace ""resentful"" with ""distrustful"". For people do not trust what they do not know. *But* they can certainly be resentful of what they do know.

Anyway, we humans are a social bunch. Our comfortable social groups are quite small.

Ignoring the fact that the world is in a financial crisis at the moment is very disingenuous and Greece is not representative of the rest of the Eurozone.

The reason Greece is in trouble is because its government has lost the ability to inflation-tax its population with the introduction of the Euro. The people who set up the Euro were very well aware of this and set up some guidelines for countries in the Euro (constraints on budget deficits and debt). The point was to force real economic development, a country like Greece is fairly underdeveloped for a Western one and relying on constant monetary expansion is not a particularly good development strategy, real institutional reforms are needed, real productivity gains are needed. The Greeks are the most hardworking people in the OECD, but some of the poorest too.

Actually, as you can probably remember, Germany was only a few years back regularly called the sick man of Europe by publications like Newsweek or The Economist. You have to remember, Germany is an export-dependent economy and the Euro has been a very strong currency. Germany only started doing well during the crisis when Ireland's and later Greece's dire economic straits contributed to a depreciation of the Euro. Suddenly, expensive German exports became cheaper on the world market and German exports rose sharply and unemployment went down.

As for economies such as Portugal, Italy or Spain, they have some of the same problems as Greece, but were basically hit in speculative attacks directly related to the crisis in Greece. It didn't happen because they're in the Euro, particularly not in Spain's case since that country has very little debt. It happened because of the way the financial system is set up.

&gt;Meanwhile Switzerland is one of the best performing European economies despite not being in the Euro

I don't know if you've been following, but Switzerland recently had to peg its currency to the Euro 1.2:1 because they too have been hit by financial speculators buying up their currency and making their export industry totally uncompetitive. The same is happening to Norway now. No economy exists in a vacuum.

When a country joins the Eurozone it says goodbye to huge waves of short-term currency speculation distorting the economy, that's one of the advantages to being in the Euro.

&gt;Further, what connection is there between the UK not being in the Euro and our current economic problems? Perhaps you could sketch a plausible reason why the two are connected? I doubt you can.

Hah, that was actually my point. There is no direct connection. The UK has bad finances, Greece has bad finances - that's the problem. The UK isn't in a bad shape because it didn't join the Euro - it's in a bad shape for number of other reasons.

Right, but a Germany with a sovereign currency could have forced the DMark down anyway in order to aid exporters like the Swiss have just done by announcing they'd buy unlimited quantities of foreign currencies.  The fact that Germany is doing quite well because the likes of Greece and Spain are being flayed alive to satisfy the demands of German exporters is not some advantage of the Euro.  It's a shameful property that only demonstrates too well that the Euro is a stupid idea: you cannot just tie the likes of Germany and Greece together into a currency union with a one size fits all monetary policy.  It makes no sense.

&gt; As for economies such as Portugal, Italy or Spain, they have some of the same problems as Greece, but were basically hit in speculative attacks directly related to the crisis in Greece.

Yes, and as the Swiss Central Bank is able to act independently, it engaged in unlimited buying of foreign currencies in order to drive the Swiss Franc back down.  You're just proving my point.

This is ridiculous.  The Greek problems are directly related to them being inside the Euro and being able to borrow exorbitant amounts at record low prices.

Lange Rede kurzer Sinn: In der Wirtschaft kannst Du Deinen Traktor auch nicht kostenlos verborgen. Oder dein Feld oder deine Fabrik. Ansonsten kannst Du nicht selbst produzieren und verhungerst. Deshalb werden die Dinge vermietet. Geld ist nur ein Hilfsmittel, ohne den wir Tauschwirtschaft hätten. Es symbolisiert den Traktor, das Feld oder die Fabrik. Ohne den Zins verleiht niemand Geld. Und Verleihen ist nie ohne Risiko. Vielleicht macht der Schuldner den Traktor kaputt? Vielleicht verliert er das Geld. Deshalb hat Zins zwei Teile. Den 'normalen' Teil (die Gebühr) und den Risikoanteil. Das Risiko variiert von Schuldner zu Schuldner.

Das alles ist so einfach und simpel und liegt so klar auf der Hand, dass man schon ziemlich lange Videos braucht, um die Leute so stark zu verwirren, dass sie denken der Zins wäre etwas 'Unnatürliches'.

I know that the Eurozone lacks the ability to conduct a perfect monetary policy that would work optimally in all regions of the union. That is, for a lack of better words, a feature, not a flaw. The Eurozone countries, provided they stick to the original guidelines on debt and deficits, were deemed sufficiently close - intra-country differences in interest rates must be held up against inter-country differences. While you lose the benefits of independent monetary policy you gain easier trade, more perfect information, economic integration and convergence. And whoever said that the equilibirum interest rates of various regions of the European economy perfectly correspond to the borders of European countries? It's a fallacy to think so. Eastern Germany needs a different interest rate from Western Germany. Same goes for the different regions of Italy. Same goes for the constituent countries of the UK where an interest rate determined in London makes Wales' economy stagnate. In the end, you subdivide Europe into so many small currency regimes looking for the optimal exchange rate that it becomes obvious why there are many non-monetary policy gains to having a single currency and a less than optimal exchange rate for all parties involved.

The fact that the EU is not necessarily a perfectly optimal currency area does not prove that the national currencies are any better. The UK is one example. Often monetary policies are held up as some kind of life-saving macroeconomic tool, while in the real world, sometimes it's works the way it should, sometimes it doesn't.

It's true that if Greece was still on the drachma they could probably inflate their way out of this one, an easier choice for the government which has a hard time collecting taxes. But a different monetary policy would never change what is fundamentally wrong with the Greek economy.

What if, instead, Greek had actually tried to live up to the rules on debt and budget deficits? As in actually complying with the terms of the monetary union. Then no one would be calling the death of the Euro, despite the common interest rate. In the end, it has something to do with real problems in the real economy, not monetary policy.",0,1317042556,null,0,false,0,c2mnwsa,t3_kr53g,t1_c2mnwsa,t1_c2mnnln,1427648373,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

&gt; The UK is one example. Often monetary policies are held up as some kind of life-saving macroeconomic tool, while in the real world, sometimes it's works the way it should, sometimes it doesn't.

Yes, and removing even the possibility of using monetary policy from a government is insanity.  Painkillers don't always work.  It doesn't mean they should be removed from a doctor's arsenal.

Everything is being simplified so much, even by many economists.

The reason that the what-ifs are important in this case is because they pinpoint the exact reason for why Greece is in trouble. Greece joined the Euro knowing it would not be able to use easy monetary policy whenever its economy fucks up, yet it still joined and made sure it _could_ join by faking its financial statements.

You may also like the [EdF galleries](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kosmograddotnet/sets/72157626287680922/) although all the manholes I know about have been welded shut.

I highly recommend [Baunau's book](http://www.amazon.com/Catacombes-Paris-promenade-interdite-French/dp/2359600249/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317050326&amp;sr=8-1) - he knows a lot of the networks very well.  Unfortunately it was published with the photos way too large, so they're a bit grainy.

There's a page with some amazingly lit photos of the catas, but I can't find it right now - if you're very interested, I'll have a look.

Tolbiac is at the corner of Rue Regnault and Rue Nationale - it's the old [Gare des Gobelins](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gare_de_Paris-Gobelins).  There are 2 other old gares frigo under Paris, but one is now a legitimized artists' ""squat"", and the last one is Bercy.  [We did that a few weeks ago](http://www.kosmograd.net/frozen-vegetables/), not all that much to see although it's pretty cool just to get in.  

If you're really interested, I'd first take a look at the touristy catacombs (which are actually pretty cool) and then start asking around to see if you can find someone to take you down in the GRS or one of the other ones.  Took me a bit of research, but you'll eventually find someone who knows someone, and then it's easy.

true,caspervox,null,null,"I'm not sure if I got your point, but I'd like to describe a short example how the German Government (like other European Governments) tries to support a business in an economic downturn.

At first, the German State has an huge interest in collecting taxes to finance our Social Systems and other expenses. So naturally the Government likes to see a business making revenue and paying taxes.

Secondly, the State is aware that companies are also a very important part of our Social System - especially because the Social Systems are at the limit. So e.g. in last huge economic downturn the Government used an instrument called [""Kurzarbeit""](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurzarbeit) / [""short-work""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurzarbeit) to keep people employed.

&gt; In 2009 the German government had budgeted 5.1 billion euros on the programme, which replaced some of the lost income of over 1.4 million workers. The program was favorably cited in a 2009 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report, which stated that it had saved nearly 500,000 jobs during the recession.[2] Besides helping to avoid mass layoffs, proponments of the program also cite its keeping skilled work groups together and avoiding the atrophy of their skills during extended layoffs, while critics have expressed concerns about its expense and that it might prop up non-viable firms.[3]

&lt;Edit&gt;
According to the German Ministry of Finance  the business taxes in Germany are 29,83 % (2008).

* Neither federal nor state nor local governments negotiate taxes with entrepreneurs (officially).
* Some companies pay essentially 0% tax via various loop holes or legal exemptions. Those exemptions are designed to keep certain businesses in certain situation profitable (which politicians hope will discourage layoffs).
* In negotiations between workers (trade unions) and employers, it is usually agreed to avoid firing workers, which do not want to quit. While these negotiations are supposed to happen strictly between employer and employees (by proxy), a government representative often gets involved as a moderator, which lets them influence the outcome.
* Federal government (and national media) will get involved if &gt; 5000 jobs are at stake, but not for some 100. It works like this:
    * Big business (preferable foreign hedge funds) threatens to fire everyone in a company to become more profitable.

Well here's a similar sentiment (less concisely), from an 1877 Mormon sermon:
&gt; If you find a man seeking only the affection of those who are great, depend upon it he is ambitious and self-seeking; but when you observe that a man seeks the affection of those who can do nothing for him, but for whom he must do everything, you know that he is not seeking himself, but that pure benevolence aways his heart.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"EU countries are not indebted to each others, they are indebted to a large number of private citizens, banks and various kinds of funds. 

For example pension funds, where I and my employer are obligated by law to contribute a sum corresponding to 22% of my wage, are obligated by law to invest into very safe investment instruments, usually to bonds issued by creditworthy governments. If governments would renegade on their obligations, all my pension savings would be gone, same too with all people from janitors to managers.

Of course a country can renegade on its debt, there is nothing anybody can do for that, but if it does, then nobody will invest to the loans of that country in the future. And if there is a large scale renegotiation of government debts, states won't be trusted any more, causing money to flow into other investments.


Anyway, the real problem isn't debt, it just a symptom of the real problem. The real problem is that states are consuming more money than they earn, either they start to earn/tax more or they decrease their spending until they spend as much as they earn. In some cases like for example Greece, the only viable solution besides fixing their whole culture, is abandoning having a large scale government, shutting down everything besides police and the army, and becoming a low tax capitalistic state with no welfare or social services.

It isn't actually hard to understand why, at the moment, Germans seem very reluctants to bail out greece, while Holland (my country) is not. 

After years of mean jokes about Germans being assholes, and the whole guilt-trip thing about WWII, the germans overcompensate and are actually nice people. Unlike the rest of us.

Bailing out Greece, means bailing out Banks that owe money to Greece. Those banks are not in Greece. They are in Germany, France, Italy and Holland.

Here's a question: what if Greece could pay the interest of all its debt? Who would make the profit? The banks. Yet, when they make a loss, it's our turn to pay. I'm no expert, but if we nationalize the debts, shouldn't we nationalize the profits as well?
