true,timoleon,null,null,"They are rather weakly correlated, but the author (intentionally?) neglects that many other factors are involved in the European debt crisis, some of which carry much greater weight.

Proof:  
Ireland has actually a trade surplus with Germany, whereas Greece, Spain, and Italy have had trade deficits for years, if not decades. 

If balances of trade were so important, why has Ireland been affected so badly, and why didn't the Mediterranean countries get in trouble years ago? 

P.S.

I think the basic idea here is that when a country has a persistently negative balance of trade, money from that country is flowing to her export partners, in exchange for goods and services imported. This may lead to the importing country owing more and more money to her exporters.

However, the *balance of trade* is only one element of the overall *balance of payments* - if e.g. foreign tourists spend their money in Greece, or Greeks working in Germany transfer money home, it would offset the trade deficit.

The reasoning in this article, that the PIIGS governments cannot balance their budgets because of their negative balances of trade with Germany, still looks like an attempt at blame-shifting.

Und das zurecht, weil die Vereinigung der 13 Kolonien rein gar nichts mit der Europäischen Union zu tun hat - wieso wird dieser absurde Vergleich nur immer wieder aufgewärmt?

Die amerikanischen Einzelstaaten hatten eine gemeinsame Sprache, nah verwandte bis identische Kulturen, Regierungs- und Justizsysteme, einen gemeinsam gewonnen Unabhängigkeitskrieg, rapide wachsende Bevölkerungen, reichlich ungenutzte Ressourcen, etc.pp. 

Die EU hat nichts dergleichen.  Für ihre Bürger bedeutet mehr Integration vor allem mehr Bürokratie, höhere Kosten, weniger Selbstbestimmung und Demokratie. Was der gemeinsame Markt an Vorteilen bringt wird mit Protektionismus und Agrarsubventionen teuer erkauft. 

Politik ""auf europäischer Ebene"" leider unweigerlich unter dem ""One-size-does-not-fit-all"" Problem. Die gegenwärtige Eurokrise ist ein schmerzhaftes Beispiel.

&gt;Die Zeitungen, die Stammtische alle reden nur über die eine Frage: ""Was kostet das?""

Was soll so vermessen daran sein, bei der Integration Europas nach Kosten und Nutzen, Gewinnern und Verlieren zu fragen?

The proposed referendum might not change much actually. If you manage it well, you'll get maybe 20 countries to say they want more Europe, and the rest says no. Then you just end up as today, in negotiations between separate countries.

If we really want some unity, maybe we can begin by having a European-wide media, like a public European TV channel. Every country have its national media, through which most people get their news (focused on the country of course) and see their politicians. Maybe the reason we don't have a big interest in EU politics is because we don't see these guys. Why Von Rompuy or Barroso haven't been on my TV for debates yet? I know nothing on these guys ideas compared to the local politicians.

Also, I think it would help if the different political parties of each countries which share the same opinion would start to work together a bit. There was an initiative like this from the French and German left-wing at the last EU parliament elections. This kind of thing will be needed if we ever get a direct EU government election.

East is the bay of [Mont Saint Michel](http://www.yvanlepape.eu/IMG/jpg/baie-reflet_mont_st_michel.jpg) (winter or spring is the best time, summer is unbearable because of the insane amount of tourists). The coast on the west is absolutely gorgeous. You can catch buses to [Dinard](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Dinard_pointe_de_la_Malouine.jpg), and [Saint Jacut](http://www.survoldefrance.fr/photos/highdef/12/12454.jpg). If you feel like it, grab a ferry to the Channel islands.
Then Go to Lannion and get to the [Côte de Granit Rose](http://www.breizheasycommerce.com/images/granit-rose-2.jpg) (Pink Granite Coast).
The west-end of Bretagne is the next destination, catch a train to Brest. The city not so beautiful (except a few places) and has a huge amount of nice pubs and cafés. Buses are available for Crozon - nicknamed the ""Bout du monde"" (end of the world) - which has an impressive brocken rocky coastline (as most of the western end of Bretagne). I'm not very familiar with the southern coast, but I'm told its really nice too. When you will get back to Rennes, grab a train to Nantes, while it's not officially Breton, it is by tradition and one of the most beautiful city of the area. Really nice city and people.

Bordeaux would be accessible from there :)

Climate during winter : snow and ice are rare on the coast, temperatures typically vary between 0c and 8c (-5c to 5c inland). Storm season is usually from early February to mid March (by storm season, I mean it's likely there will be one in this period, not that it's a 40 days storm ^^).

Also, the teaching of French history has come a long way from the nationalistic hagiography that it was considered necessary to teach in the beginning of the 20th century, in order to establish some national identity and feeling.

For example, Marie-Antoinette is not strongly associated in French minds with ""Let then eat cake"" nor with foreign influence. Historical consensus (which is actively taught in high-school history classes) is that she was first and foremost a deeply unhappy and frustrated child(ish) bride whose political influence was almost zero, but was the convenient target of many libelous campaigns.

As for Robespierre, his political action is not described in itself as extremist. The context is one of complete immaturity regarding political science that has been going on elsewhere in the world up to today. Robespierre himself was idealistic and uncorrupted, but lacked, as did almost everyone in France at that moment, sufficient understanding of the risks of a policy of epuration (including the expected ending of being eaten by the monster one has created, which is precisely what killed him.)

Neither Robespierre nor M.-A. are considered tragic figures: French upheavals in that period have been so bloody and protracted that the Revolution is considered one major crisis which had aftershocks (1830, 1848, 1871) for a whole century afterwards before the French political culture eventually managed to settle down.

They are not heroes neither: individual tragedies are dwarfed in the French view by the collective destructions that the nation went through. This is also reinforced by the fact that the 1789 Revolution was at 98% a completely Parisian phenomenon; for the rest of the country, it was much less important than the conscriptions and deaths from the following Napoleonic wars.",0,1313931117,null,0,false,0,c2e2vw7,t3_jpiio,t1_c2e2vw7,t1_c2e2i7w,1427499768,8,false,france,t5_2qhjz,8

Oh right. Well, that makes all the difference in the world.

In that case, my initial assumptions of your idiocy having proved to be completely without foundation, let me offer you some more useful advice.

I think the main thing is to make contact with the sort of German that native speakers see all the time. Stuff like BILD Zeitung, youtube comments and IRC channels are OK, but they're actually much less helpful and probably less easy to understand than stuff like focus.de, films, TV series (watching the dub of Heroes atm) and articles you find on /r/de. Sure the vocabulary is smaller, but you have a whole lot more journalese, abbreviations noone in real life uses and weird little BILD-isms. Also, even though it's used in news broadcasts and magazines ('highbrow stuff'), formal language is easier to understand and research than informal language and slang. 

You want to make sure you learn words in context. Preferably whole sentences. For example, because I've been watching a lot of German TV, I know that 'piece by piece' is 'Stück für Stück' in German (lit. piece for piece). Because I haven't learned words from a big word list, I know that if I've been discussing something and I want to say ""I've been waiting for that since the 17th of december"", I'll say ""Darauf warte ich seit dem 17. Dezember"". I know that:

* The thing you've just been discussing, the topic of the sentence, comes first in German
* the finite verb comes second (all this technical language will be clear to you after a little time grappling with german grammar)
* warten comes with auf, not with the accusative case
* You use the present tense for something happening in the past that continues up til the present
* seit takes the dative case

There's a whole load of stuff that needs to be learned, and exposing yourself to the German language in a context you enjoy is probably the only way to do it.

The Michel Thomas courses are also really useful.

Of course, if you actually hang around german speakers then you might not need them. Or they might prove to be really useful. I don't know, I learn German by myself and so far (sadly) I haven't had any opportunity to actually use it IRL.

That audio material will teach you the basics of the language and quite a bit of useful vocabulary. From here on you need more vocabulary.

I've tried Livemocha, Rosetta Stone and, for myself at least, any of that stuff that forces you to sit in front of your computer and click buttons is a terrible drag.

What worked for me for vocabulary is german music. Since it's repetitive, the new words stick, once you actually identify them and know what they mean (MUST use a lyrics sheet, don't try to guess them). But of course you might not need this if you have real people around you.

For fluency in identifying proper spoken German, try the Deutsche Welle YouTube channel.

And remember, people on the street rarely speak the official language. This is even truer for Germans where people from different parts of the country might not even UNDERSTAND eachother in their specific dialects.

The ö is like the 'e' in ""nerd"". Also, the polite form capitalises the 's'. Otherwise, it would be the plural version of ""you"".

Also, those are vowels you've listed, not consonants. The ""whole einen/einem thing"" is the difference between the accusative and dative cases, and it's very important.

mit (with), nach (after), bei (at/alongside), seit (since), von (of/from/by), zu (to/at/for), außer (apart from), aus (from/of), and gegenüber (opposite/across from), are prepositions that always take the dative case, whereas almost all others can take the accusative or the dative.

true,Bhima,ASTR,Austria,"Speaking as someone who lives in Austria and watches news from Germany from the outside I see things slightly differently:

&gt; She is reactive to public opinion, rather than proactive.

I read about other German politicians (and Austrians also actually) goading public anger by false and misleading statements about this crisis, the state of the Euro, and cost of supporting it.  So this creates a strange and unfortunate dynamic of Merkel reacting opinion which is substantially manufactured political outrage.  I do not know enough about internal German politics but I suspect that this clamor is ginned up by the opposition.  Meaning Merkel is reactive to the political machinations of her opponents.  That makes me wonder if we all in Europe are being held hostage by German opposition bent on taking advantage of this crisis to secure political gain over Merkel and her party.  If that is the case, it bears uncomfortable similarity to the Republicans and Tea Party in America. 

&gt; for Merkel, German politics supersedes the health of the EU and the Eurozone at large.

I think this is related to the point you made which I just commented on.  I've read solid analysis showing that Germany profits most from the existence of the EU monetary union, that Germany has the most to lose from the failure of the Euro, that Germany stands to gain the most from a successful crisis resolution.  But this analysis has been drowned out by all the other hand wringing, teeth gnashing, and clamor.  Merkel &amp; Sarkozy both should be emphatically making the point that we all (members / citizens / residents of the EU) benefit from a successful crisis resolution.

That leads me to unfortunately agree with your conclusion... which is frustrating.

One last point.  I think, with Euro bonds and tighter fiscal union, we are setting ourselves up for an interesting tension between parties which haven't been spoken about very much.  I imagine if Euro bonds / tighter fiscal union existed during 2002-2007.  Some EU periphery nations have gone into debt buying military hardware from corporations in EU member states.  So on one hand the Germans &amp; French corporations will want to sell a lot of things but on the other hand the German State might not be happy with the sort of debt that creates.  What would the Euro Fighter deals looked like with that sort of tension?  What would have the Greek arms buildup look like?  What sort of tension would involvement in NATO / American boondoggles create?

Most of the opposition to Eurobonds and fiscal union comes from the CSU (the CDU's regional sister party), some members of the CDU, and much of the FDP.

Free really are the best.
A little bit of context : a few years ago, when everybody else was charging 45€/month for a 582kb connection, they said ""it's 30€"".
Then, a few months later, they said ""we're upgrading everybody to 1024k for free"", and then they said ""we're giving you the fastest connection we can (using ADSL2+) for the same price"", and then they said ""you know, we're giving you telephone and TV for free"".

They have a consistant track record when it comes to new features for free, and have also a kind of geeky side, which means that their hardware support stuff that is not supported elsewhere.

For instance, they have reverse DNS for free, IPv6, static IP address, and the router supports NAT, and DHCP static leases for a looong time.

Also, when you are a subscriber, you get to be able to use any ""FreeWifi"" hotspot, which is basically a separate SSID broadcast by any router, so you are pretty sure to find one in range pretty much anywhere in Paris.

So, go with free, and don't get lured by the shiny advertisement made by the other ISPs.

Last but not least, you can watch 100+ TV channels for free on your PC using VLC, and even watch several channels on differents machines at the same time, in HD.

You are correct that Yugoslavia was an economic wonder in its earlier decades with rapid industrialization and great social rights, but there were also terrible inefficiencies in the system with many employed not actually doing anything at work. But economic problems served only as a catalyst for the break-up, they were not the cause.

Ethnic tensions started after the first world war in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which was Serb dominated. In WW2 fascists took advantage of that and created their puppet state in a croatian part of Yugoslavia, which then commited great atrocities against serbian population. After the war a federal republic republic was founded in which the western republics wanted more autonomy and Serbia wanted more centralization. Protests in early 70s resulted in a new constitution in 1974. which decreased serbian influence and recognized autonomy of its provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo. In the 80s, shit started hitting the fan in Kosovo (and is still hitting the fan today), which radicalized serbian population and gave great power to Milosevic. In Slovenia and Croatia people wanted democracy and westernization. That process in Croatia was also fueled by extreme nationalism which didn't help to decrease rising tensions between Serbs and Croats. And after that shit started hitting all the fans, everywhere.

I'm sure you probably knew most of that, but the main point is that there was a lot of dissent, which started a long time ago and was mostly swiped under the rug instead of being dealt with (properly, not by locking people up). That dissent didn't need extra fuel from the IMF, CIA or anyone outside the country, no matter what one documentary says.

While there may have been dissent and disagreement, it seems the deliberate if supporting nationalist entities probably sped along what may have been inevitable anyway, slovenia and croatia made the bulk of the wealth creation there so were unhappy that they were sponsoring the bosnians and serbians, that tito kept this all together is to his credit, he was a great leader and an inspiration for socialist style governance around the world.
So my history with the region started a few years ago, a lover of mine was croatian, the first ex yugo id met ever, she says serbs/ croats all the same. I have spent the last two summers at exit festival in novi sad and clearly serbia is desparate for investment, the serbian people have suffered for a long time, low wages, poor infrastructure, the loss.of their holy land, they got the worst deal. Despite all this they remain warm, kind people and honestly they have my heart. They say the  country is suffering from corruption and the leaders cannot be trusted so entering the EU right now would be the wrong move, because the investment that came from that would end up in the pockets of crooks.

The lack of a lingua franca is an elephant in the room for Europe. The only languages that make sense in any way would be English, German, Spanish and French. The only ones that make sense in the context of a wider world outside of Europe are English and Spanish. And of those two, English is already the lingua franca for the world of technology, trade and air travel. 

I would stipulate that British English *not* be taught, and that the Brits need to learn to cope with this without complaint. A slightly reduced form of English is emerging that Europeans use to talk to each other, as well as people in places like Singapore and India.

true,evilpeter,HUNG,Hungary,"Med schools have lower standards (almost none) for admission, but have the same eu standards for graduation as any other country. This is particularly true when it comes to foreign students. At one of the four medical schools here, there is a two tiered system - basically the hungarian state system which is free for hungarians (subsidised by the gov) who meet their highschool requirements, and unsubsidised for those who didnt get enough points for admission. These students can still be accepted, but must pay tuition.

On the foreign side, basically anybody is accepted (its a pay program, with tuition at about 12000 us a year and these studends dont count for national stats of keaving doctors, since they all return to their native country) in the six year program, more than 600 students start 1st year (1200 total), and about 100 or fewer graduate from each side. For the hungarians, the philosophy is that especially with a shortage of docs, having high admission standards would result in fewer potenial grads, and if they arent good enough to graduate, they wont hurt anybody anyway (aside- also, close to one third who graduate go on to be research scientists and not physicians).  

On the english prgram side, its really just a disgusting cash grab. With promises of medical education, the admit a load of students who have no business being at a med school, and fail them after taking a few years of tuition money from them. Those who DO end do end up graduating, however, are among the best educated medical graduates - in theory.

By ""in theory"", i literally mean that they know all the medical textbook stuff. In practice, they are horrible. Because of the low salary of docors, in clinics, the most senior doctors insist on seeing all the patients, because - as the article pointed out - there is a longstanding practice of gratuity money or ""hálapénz"". This is euphamised as a tip, but has been known to serve as graft in many cases, where docs demand an envelope even before seeing a patient. So students - and even residents - rarely get a chance to handle their own cases, because the senior docs do all the work (which they find boring and tedious, but do for the ""tips"", which easily double or triple their salaries).  This leaves the medical students to watch if they are lucky (senior donts dont really like it when theres an audience for the tip giving), study from their books,  or just hang around doing nothing.

I go out of my way to point out to my classmates (im doing a phd at medschool here) that whenever hospital situations are depicted on tv or films from nirth america, all the students and residents are doing ""all the work"", and not the senior doctor, like here in hungary. Im always amazed that this is a revelation to them.  So they are just forced to study and watch. They end up with amazing book smarts (those who actually manage to graduate from hungary are consistently among the highest scorers on board exams from other countries), but have close to zero practical experience. 

So what would you do in a hungarian medical grad's shoes? You can stay in hungary and work 60 to 80 hours a week as a glorified assistant to a senior doctor for 100000 forints a month (about 500 dollars), or you can move to anywhere in the eu without limitation (except language issues) and actually work as a doctor for at least 5 or 6 times that salary (more if you work overtime) as a starting resident. The article doesnt even point out that doubling a salary to 1000 dollars a month is still crap pay compared to the jobs the leaving doc get outside hungary.

As for basing yourself in Florence to go to Rome, Venice, and the Cinque Terre... You might find time to be a serious constraint. Florence-Rome: the fastest train is about 1:30. so that shouldn't be a problem... Though, there are millions of things to see and do in Rome. So I don't know if 1 day would suffice.

Florence-Venice also, the fastest train is about 2:00. So that should be feasible. Because there isn't all that much to see in Venice. It's just nice to walk around and get lost.

As for Le Cinque Terre... The quickest train you can take is over 3 hours. And, as the name implies, there are 5 cities in the area. So unless you plan on visiting only 1 or 2, I doubt you'll have the time. But again, there aren't many things to see... It's just a lot of beautiful scenery.
