condivido le tue difficoltà a trovare una fonte di informazione indipendente o quasi. per risponderti, non penso assolutamente che repubblica e corriere siano imparziali.

certo, più leggibili del giornale o di libero, quello sì.. e notevolmente, anche. però repubblica ha perso tantissima credibilità con le infami ""10 domande"", che erano evidentemente propaganda, non giornalismo. da lì in poi, sempre peggio.

il corriere è più ""terzista"", cerca sempre di non sbilanciarsi in giudizi definitivi.. e questo lo rende fastidioso, perché sembra che i suoi giornalisti abbiano paura di spingersi troppo in là e perdere il posto.

true,HardlyWorkingDotOrg,null,null,"Problem is, after the merge, the congestion continues. And this baffles me even more than people who don't know how to merge.  
  
Given this situation:  
3 lanes, the left most will be closed due to construction. It will merge with the middle lane. After the merge, the two remaining lanes will be ""moved"" in a *very* light bend around the construction site.  
  
I can deal with the fact that due to merging, you will have slower traffic. **But**, after the merge has happened and you *could* go 80 km/h as permitted by the traffic signs, why do people then have to brake to a standstill just because the two lanes make the slightest of curves to the left? You could drive through that going 200km/h. This is not a 180 degree turn you need to take in first gear!  
  
As far as I am concerned, once the merge is done, there is nothing that should stop you from driving the speed that is allowed while passing the construction site. But that apparently is too much to ask. So they could just take down the 80 km/h signs as you will *never* get to that speed. Only after you passed the site, people suddenly realize again that they are on the Autobahn and start accelerating again.

So, if you want to leave the room at the end of March, they need notification by January 31 and to leave at the end of September, they need notification by July 31.

Hope that's clear.

They are asking you to sign and return both copies of the lease contract and return it to them with a copy of your Studienbescheinigung (proof you're enrolled in the school), and pay the security deposit. 

The security deposit is the 410 euro and the signed leases (plus what I've listed above), proof you have paid the security deposit and the authorisation for the Studentenwerk to automatically withdraw your rent must be submitted by the 23rd of September. Otherwise, they will rent the room to someone else. 

From the pictures you have, you need to sign pictures #2&amp;#3 (you probably have 2 copies of this to sign?) and fill out your bank information on picture #4. Transfer the 410 euro to the bank details listed on the first page. Bring the confirmation of that transfer, proof of your enrollment and the signed papers to them by the 23rd.

My advice: Be nice, be open, do not be shy and do not let the principal/assistant principal/ Didaktische Leitung load too much work on your shoulders. There's always a shortage of teachers and in the two years I was there, the language assistants (other languages, though) taught full classes, even though they were not trained for that, yet. Develop an idea of what you would like to learn/see/assist in in the first three weeks and ask to be placed in these classes. Most of the teachers are very nice and helpful but also very busy. Only a few of them speak French so you will have to learn German in order to communicate with them. The kids are nice, too, most of them. One of the French teachers is pretty controlling, so beware. (I don't want to mention her name, but you'll find out easily.) If you need help with anything, ask the Referendare (trainees). They are pretty busy, too, but usually they can feel your pain of being new to a place.  BRrhl is pretty cool.

I'm not particularly sure the best solution for this is a common agency to take the whole thing over though; perhaps just some common funds + something FRONTEX-like to aid in most problematic parts of the border, + perhaps some penalty for countries not doing enough? (and is this much different from the current situation?)

Whatever the case, decided-upon system need be strong enough to reasonably disallow countries from imposing internal border controls willfully, since that takes away any certainty re having a borderless Europe, like suggested:

&gt;The Commission wants to introduce border controls by qualified majority voting for predictable events, such as football matches. Regarding unforeseen events, member countries could still take unilateral action, but only for a period not exceeding five days, after which the EU would decide whether or not to grant an extension of measures taken.

I'd expect just immigrants getting arrested more consistently, rather than illegally entering the Schengen zone.

Indeed - but this very example creates huge tensions precisely because of this. I think the worst aspect of a system where one country does the work while others benefit, is that it sparks national rivalries rather than any unity - so this should be minimized (so its successor system will have its loans as senior, and presuming more fiscal centralization, this should guarantee that countries wouldn't actually need to pay up any of their guarantees)

There are already speakers just about everywhere, so finding teachers would be the essence of easy, should it be chosen as a universal language. It has a culture which strongly promotes intercommunication, peace, and science. Most importantly, it's dead easy. It takes mere weeks to achieve non-trivial communication in Esperanto, and about 100 hours to achieve a moderately respectable level of fluency. Compare that to, well, anything else out there, and it's obvious Esperanto shines. 

A Mandarin/English pidgin could be created, but the culture it would foster is that of commercialism. Not only that, but too much would leak into the language from English and Mandarin, and it would quickly get crushed by one or both. Frankly, even if it succeeded, it would fail. 

An important note is that while Esperanto does have predominantly Romantic morphemes, it is highly agglutinative, and very flexible with word order. This makes it structurally similar to Eastern languages such as Mandarin or Japanese. So it is not ""just as foreign as any other language"" to non-Romantic speakers. That's a myth.

'Cause as we all know your culture is based off what sounds your people use to communicate with...

""Most importantly, it's dead easy""

For whom? A speaker of a Romance language will have plenty of cognates. Speakers of, you know, the other 6000 languages won't find it any less foreign, than you would probably find ǃʼOǃKung.

""It takes mere weeks to achieve non-trivial communication in Esperanto, and about 100 hours to achieve a moderately respectable level of fluency. Compare that to, well, anything else out there, and it's obvious Esperanto shines.""

English was a pidgin of Old Saxon German and Norman French. Obviously, English speakers inherently have a culture of raiding and pillaging farmsteads...

You don't know Jack shit about Mandarin. It's word order is mostly fixed and it's an isolating language, not an agglutinative one. Just because a language is in East Asia does not mean they are all alike. ばか

Ah. I see where the confusion is. You believe there is a chance that some national language could be chosen as an international language. If that were a possibility, it would have happened already. It's not: no speakers of French would allow English to be chosen, no speakers of English would allow Mandarin to be chosen, etc. because if that were to happen, the native speakers of the chosen language would be at a *permanent* disadvantage in commerce and politics. Therefore, if we are speaking seriously of universal languages, we are implicitly talking about a language *constructed for the purpose.* There is no other viable option for establishing a universally spoken language except global domination. At that point, there won't be options for anyone but the winner.

&gt;""There are already speakers just about everywhere""

No, you misunderstand. There are Esperanto speakers just about everywhere. Not tons of them, but we're spread out to just about everywhere. There's not too many places you can go where you would not find at least one. Therefore, there is a teacher pool. Are they all competent teachers? No, but they don't have to be. They only have to be good enough to teach the trained teachers to speak it correctly. Esperanto takes very close to the same effort to learn as 3D Studio Max or Maya. The learning curve is pretty much the same as well. Which is to say, You can speak it well enough to order coffee and basic courtesies in a few days. You can speak reasonably understandably within a few weeks. You can achieve a somewhat halting but passable fluency in a couple of months. You can be semi-pro in a year of casual study. (Semi-pro would be: able to hold a conversation with anyone, but not ready to start translating Shakespeare)

10,000 is so wrong I'd be embarrassed to even toss the number out there. There are several thousand who speak it *natively,* so it's obvious that number is wrong. ""Official"" or not. The truth is, almost no one who has enough knowledge about the subject to have an opinion on it puts it at less than 2 million. That's still not sweeping the world by storm, but understand: it's one of the top 100 languages of the world in terms of number of speakers. Your idea that there's a mere handful of speakers left is erroneous. There are over 25,000 *books* that have been published in Esperanto. Ten thousand. Pfft. I'm not saying you didn't get your data from an *official* source, but I am saying you didn't get it from a *reliable* one. Google is your friend.

&gt;(insert source here). Also, who was learning it? People good at languages, or what?

(nope. Google it.) I suck at language learning. Or at least, I'm no prodigy. I was up and running in two weeks, about an hour to an hour and a half per day. I've spoken to people who learned it passably in a week. I've heard of people who have learned it in a weekend, but those people are extreme polyglots. 

&gt;""Frankly, even if it succeeded, it would fail""
&gt;
&gt;Frankly even if it's hot, it's cold.

What I mean is, even if such a language were created and adopted to a wide degree, English and Mandarin speakers would not be able to keep from adding a hodgepodge of words and strange idioms and exceptions to it, and it would end up a huge mess, harder than either English or Mandarin. It would still be a monstrosity that would crush itself into something barely usable, and instead of being an auxiliary language that can be used alongside national languages, it would crush them. That's not desirable, because the culture is crushed with the language. I don't know if you've ever thought about it, but the two are inseparable. In fact, the missing element that causes conlangs to fail is culture. Assuming the inventor didn't crush it first--that's happened, too.

&gt;You don't know Jack shit about Mandarin.

Guilty: I don't know Jack about Mandarin. I know a bit about Japanese, but not Mandarin. I can't know everything. I did make that assumption, sorry. The point is still valid.

Do NOT park your car near one of the ditches running along the streets. It's a RaR sport to push the cars in the ditch and you have to pay the tow car.

Drugs aren't hard to get to the festival area, just don't put them in your hood or anywhere on your body where they might be felt like weapons when touched (checks are mostly for weapons, not so much for drugs), or so i've heard. Absolutely no knifes or other weapons on the festival area. My last visit is some years ago, but from my experience as a security worker, you're also not allowed to bring any kind of glass and no easily inflammable stuff (i don't know the right term for that, but i mean things like deospray). Be prepared to get your bag and your hood checked when entering the festival ground.

You might want to be familiar how emergency workers look like in Germany (Rotes Kreuz, red cross) and memorize their location on the festival area, so you recognize and find them easily in an emergency.

Otherwise the normal festival rules apply:

- Don't leave valuable things in your tent. Take a part with you and leave a part in your car.

- Bring garbage bags, a flashlight (no light at the camping grounds), toilet paper, condoms, ear plugs (if you want to sleep at night), lots of food and warm clothes (just in case).

- Clean up afterwards, don't leave your garbage lying around (even if everybody else is doing it)

- Be friendly, be safe, have fun :)

Fukushima war nie für so eine Katastrophe ausgelegt. Die Kraftwerksbetreiber haben entgegen damals geltender japanischer Gesetze die Sicherheitsmaßnahmen aus Kostengründen nicht erhöht.

Dass das Kraftwerk heute noch steht und heute anscheinend halbwegs unter Kontrolle ist, ist 1) ein Wunder da niemals für so etwas konzipiert und 2) auch wenn es vielleicht falsch klingt, wirklich ein Zeichen für Ingenieurskunst. Es hätte noch sehr viel schlimmer kommen können.

Wenn man sich die Kräfte ansieht (stärkstes jemals gemessenes Erdbeben), die damals aufgetreten sind, dann ist es Irrsinn, dass da überhaupt noch etwas steht. Und wie gering die Folgen eigentlich sind im Vergleich dazu, wie heftig sie hätten sein können.

Man muss dazu sagen, dass Fukushima ein älteres Modell war. Dessen Schwachstellen sind offensichtlich (altes Brennmaterial war nicht innerhalb des Schutzbehälters, Probleme mit Notstromaggregaten etc). Da hat einiges versagt.

Es ist heute möglich absolut sichere Atomkraftreaktoren zu bauen. Sind halt teurer. Mit zwei Schutzbehältern, anderer Anordnung der Brennelemente etc. Das war das heftigste Erdbeben mit heftigsten Tsunami ever und das Ding steht noch obwohl alte Technologie.  Wenn man die neuen Techniken betrachtet und nicht an den Sicherheitsmaßnahmen gespart hätte, wäre gar nichts oder nur wenig geschehen.

I believe this will continue to be the reason Turkey will never join (and lets face it, France and Germany like it this way -- if Turkey were to join they would be just as important as them in the decision making process because of their population).

They sometimes rant about how Turkey should be in the EU because Cyprus is -- but again.. reality bubble. How would their people feel if they were told that the average person in Cyprus makes 3 times more money than them when from their propaganda all they seem to believe as a fact is that Cyprus is an illegally occupied part of Turkey (even though Turkey are the ones illegally occupying a third of the country in the North. The reason they intervened may have been good at the time, but the continuous occupation to this day is definitely illegal).

About 30 years ago, Cyprus was quite a poor country that was on par with Turkey. Over the years, they worked hard and pretty much earned the ability to join the EU.

It's our god given right to be allowed into your union, and if you don't accept you are racists""

If you follow the news closely on Turkey's process so far, it seems to be them demanding to join with their own rules. Lets forget the whole Cyprus angle for the moment.. Turkey isn't eligible for a lot of other reasons. It's also very interesting when you see articles of how they jail journalists, block sites online etc (even YouTube for god sake). Sure a lot of it may have been knee jerk reactions and stuff and may not be the OFFICIAL policy... but I do find it scary that it's something that they have been doing -- it gives you the idea that human rights and freedom of speech and especially freedom of information are not really high in their lists of concerns.

I honestly wonder what would happen if someone in Turkey posted bad things about Erdogan using his real name in a public/well known Turkish forum.. with photoshopped images of him wearing stockings and fishnets and getting whipped by someone (as a joke).

true,Benthetraveler,null,null,"The difference is that in a Gymnasium the school aims to get 100% of the children to get Abitur, while a Gesamtschule is a mixed system with pupils that usually would normally attend Gymnasium, Real- and Hauptschule. During the first years (I think usually at the end of 7th grade) the classes (Stufe) get divided once again and all the kids aiming for Abitur get into one class and all the kids aiming for Realschulabschluss get into another and so on. Of course you can always move up/down depending on grades but the majority finishes in the desired class.

So technically there isn't a difference between pupils who did Abitur at a Gymnasium and pupils who did it at a Gesamtschule. Problem is, many Gesamtschulen are Hauptschulen or Realschulen which were simply renaimed with no significant increase in funding/additional stuff, so a lot of Gesamtschulen have a bad reputation. It depends which you visit and how the funding/reputation is. I was at a Gesamtschule with an excellent reputation, therefor good teachers wanted to teacher there and Fördervereine were plenty and tried to improve the situation. At the very same time there were other Gesamtschulen within the city that have or had a bad reputation and nobody wants there kids to go there. As a result all the troubled students go there and the circle repeats itself.

In general I feel like the concept of Gesamtschule is superior to the concept of dreigliedriges Schulsystem (Gmynasium, Realschule and Hauptschule), however it very much depend on the Gesamtschule/funding/people in charge/neighbourhood. I hope you have a good time but I have no idea what kind of reputation the Gesamtschule Brühl has.

I was just saying that what it means to be in Europe is already defined, and defined exactly the same way as Council of Europe, which also states that its membership is open to any 'European' state, defines it. And that is to have a part of its territory on the European continent. Obviously the definition couldn't be that a country need be wholly on the European continent - then France wouldn't be 'in Europe'!

Well, to have your economic and cultural and demographic capital, with a history of roman and byzantine empires and 13 million people spanning the border of the continents, as well as almost 500 years of rule, ended only in this century, over a large part of the European land is certainly a substantial claim to being European however it were defined.

So, Turkey has been recognized to be a 'European country' already in 1949, when it joined the Council of Europe. Morocco by that same definition isn't a 'European' state, and has never been accepted into the Council of Europe either. So they cannot be denied 'like Morocco', by a geographic criteria.

In any case, given how there's plenty of criteria currently simply based on their laws and practices and continued presence in Cyprus to reject their accession, this discussion may turn out to be hypothetical...",0,1316403860,null,0,true,0,c2kwgdm,t3_kjfec,t1_c2kwgdm,t1_c2kw6li,1427617913,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

FUUUUUUUUCK, COCK, SHIT. Recumbents and upper thigh pockets in cargo-pants = don't do it.

Here the story leaves me looking for my keys in the streets of Osnabrück and enters the realm of speculation about what might have happened to my keys as far as I’m able to reconstruct the events.
Person A found my keys. Looking at them she found a little trinket from the Neumarkt Apotheke, a local pharmacy, with states if you find this keys please pass them to the pharmacy. (It's been a service of them they offered years ago, I never updated my contact data). Since it was at night and the pharmacy was closed, person A placed the keys in front of the pharmacy's door.
There they were found by person B who thought that this might be a stupid idea, especially since that shop is in the city center and the Maiwoche street festival was still going on and gave them to the police.
The police now somehow found a number of a stuff member of said apotheke. He was having a beer at the festival, but went to the police, collected the keys and looked up my contact data in the pharmacy.
As I already mentioned, the data was not up to date, the only telephone number still working was the one of my work.
I work in a team that does 24h hotlines, so when you call my work at night, you reach me or my co-workers.
Cut back to me looking for my keys. After ONE (in words: O-N-E) hour my phone rings. It’s work.

Me: ""Hi Work. What the hell can you want?""

- ""Hi Tino, it’s me Susanne, I have awesome news for you!""

true,adlerchen,null,null,"I've found where the confusion is too. Apparently, you're so obsessed about the topic of lingua franca, that you've inserted it into this conversation. Though (somewhat) related, we were talking about the intelligibility of Esperanto. Different subject. Go back and reread what we were talking about.

Also, you misinterpreted what I said about the number of fluent Esperanto speakers. 200-1000 is the official number. 10,000 is an estimate that's higher. I know some estimates go as high as several million.

""even if such a language were created and adopted to a wide degree, English and Mandarin speakers would not be able to keep from adding a hodgepodge of words and strange idioms and exceptions to it""

And that didn't happen to Esperanto? Care to explain how *eldoni* and *necesejo* mean what they mean, then? All languages have 'strange' idioms. You're a westerner, no? It's no wonder you find Esperanto's idioms 'normal' and 'obvious'. Esperanto has tons of idioms and slang, much of it taken from its source romantic languages. Frankly, if you'd spend less time talking about languages in absolutes, and more time studying as many of them as you can, you'd learn a lot about how the human mind works here, and how subjective and relative all of this is. What makes Mandarin's 'spring picture' idiom for pornography, any more strange than any other idiom? To you, it is alien, but than again as an English speaker, you don't have the perspective to see how alien ""skin flick"", ""girlie magazine"", or ""X-rated material"" are to most people on the planet. Girlie magazine?? You mean like TMZ??!!!111

As time goes on, Esperanto will evolve just like all systems of communication. Eventually slang will set in (it already has, which you've probably noticed), and later on sound change will occur. Dialects will develop and eventually we'll have different Esperantoic languages. It's how language works. Eradicate all the languages on Earth but one, and fast forward enough millennia and you'll be exactly where you started. This is part of the human condition, and it's a truth no one wants to except. There will never be a permanent or even long lasting lingua franca for the world.

*However*, under [certain conditions](http://www.daad.de/deutschland/wege-durchs-studium/zulassung/06550.en.html?id=75&amp;ebene=3) a high school degree is enough to be permitted into the German/European university system. So, you should focus on meeting those instead.

Regarding Bachelor programs, unfortunately only very few have English as the course language. There are a couple at private institutions, but those are expensive. The ones at public universities will cost you the same as an EU citizen, which depending on the state is €0-500/semester for tuition, and another €150-200/semester for enrollment (this often includes public transport or regional trains). There are many more Master programs that are taught [in English](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12610268), but by the time you have your Bachelor you will be absolutely fluent anyway. There's a course search form on the site I linked to.

Btw., whether you actually need a family to stay with or not is between you and your parents.

Hamburg is great, but also a relatively expensive to live in. If the people you know around Hamburg would like to live elsewhere, then they're probably your age and this is natural.  
Berlin would be an obvious choice as well, it would cost roughly the same as Hamburg. Munich would be much more expensive still. Smaller cities *can* be cheaper, cities in the East usually are. I'd say the best bang for the buck can be had in Leipzig, but I live there so I'm biased.

true,forlasanto,null,null,"Any living language will have Idioms. The question is whether they make sense to someone learning the language for the first time. That's dependent upon culture. Esperanto does have it's own culture, and therefore it's own idioms. Some idioms *are* borrowed, just like some words are borrowed. That's normal and expected.

Going up to the OP, titled, ""German instead of Esperanto?"" we *are* talking about the topic of lingua franca. Talking about anything else regarding languages is more or less a waste of time, because our lack of a lingua franca is *the* realworld linguistic problem; everything else is merely academic. What you refer to as obsession is, in truth, pragmatism.

My point about the number of fluent Esperanto speakers is that the official numbers are wrong and lead people to dismiss Esperanto as a dead language, which isn't remotely true. I have personally corresponded with more Esperantists than the ""official number."" Not all of them were fluent, but most were passably fluent. I meet new esperantists all the time, and most are fluent. It just doesn't take a whole lot of effort to get fluent, so it's normal that most Esperantists are passably fluent. That's the point of it.

When we're talking about a English/Mandarin pidgin, and what the influx of new words and idioms would be, we're talking about an overwhelming level. Esperanto has some borrowed idioms. It isn't overwhelming. 

Hopi are an (intentionally) isolated culture. The indigenous North American tribes' cultures have been devastated and in most cases utterly destroyed by the march of western language and culture. Even the Hopi are severely affected. It is very difficult to get the tribes' youth to carry on the traditions, and it takes extreme effort to keep their traditions alive. The oppressive nature of the English language, which brings with it Western culture, is the cause of this difficulty: The children are taught English and not taught the Hopi language, and so the English culture is the only culture they are capable of readily receiving. Language is the transmitter of culture. English is an oppressive language, and it transmits an oppressive culture. It is not a large leap to say the same for Mandarin.

We cannot consciously make a reasonable decision regarding adoption of a lingua franca until we understand that adopting a language means, de facto, also adopting it's culture. All functional languages have their own culture, and it is impossible to create a living, functional language without also creating it's culture. For examples of this, I can point to the only two successful modern conlangs: Esperanto and Klingon. Esperanto is the only successful real-world conlang *because it has it's own culture.* Klingon drives the point home even further: Klingon is incomplete and extremely difficult, yet it survives; it's survival is dependant *entirely upon the culture around which it was built!* There aren't any other living conlangs worth mentioning. That is because the other conlangs do not possess their own cultures. 

I almost feel like you're trolling me, but I also recognize that the topic of language is a volatile one which upsets people easily, and I've been abrasive with my comments. For that I apologize.

Nótese que está escrito desde el punto de vista americano, muy *business-oriented*. Si bien es el punto de vista de alguien que ha pasado por una educación ""de letras"". Desde luego saca a luz argumentos muy interesantes.

Por otra parte, aunque sean argumentos demasiado orientados hacia lo económico, entiendo que en una sociedad como la nuestra en la que es imposible sobrevivir sin dinero, este enfoque ""totalmente práctico"" resulta perfectamente válido. Según lo he entendido yo, el problema está en ese punto de eskizofrenia que hay entre los argumentos de: ""elijo una carrera de letras para que me llene el alma"" vs. ""soy infeliz porque lo que he estudiado no me da de comer"".

Podríamos plantearnos mas tarde si [trabajar ha quedado ya obsoleto](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/k7rq8/are_jobs_obsolete/), o si el estado debería subvencionar a gente que produce menos económicamente pero sí puede aportar beneficios sociales. También, aparte de que esta subvención fuera moralmente correcta o no, podría discutirse si de todas maneras no sería económicamente factible. El hecho es que a dia de hoy, y con las reglas del juego como están, los argumentos de esta señora me parecen razonables.

Tema complejo donde los haya.

La discusión del thread tampoco decepciona:

&gt; NO. I for one am an engineering student, so I have no stake in this. Hear me out : a college isn't a machine for cranking out professionals, it's supposed to educate the masses and pave the way for a more intelligent, more reasonable world. I think liberal arts achieve just this.

*drawmeasheep:*

&gt; Except the idea that higher education is for the masses is a very recent idea, dating back to somewhere round the GI Bill after WWII. Before that, only gentlemen or other upper-class men could afford to get a liberal arts education at college, rather than getting vocational training at a trade school.
Maybe our society simply can't support so many people with ""useless"" degrees. I have my degree in English and Religious Studies, so I'm not just talking shit from a science side.

*RogueEagle:*

|What is desperately needed in the US is a year off between HS and college.

*mmm_burrito:*

I highly agree. This whole conversation is missing the point. **We need better students, not just better subjects.** Students are going into colleges and getting churned out by the thousand, but they have no idea what they're getting into. If students took time off and experienced something of the real world, they'd enter into college with a much more focused mindset, and with a much better understanding of all of the consequences of that decision.

The standard liberal arts defense is that the degree prepares you for any job, but **it does not qualify you immediately**.

* Icelandic farm animals are considered to be vulnerable to deseases common on mainland Europe, so obviously it wouldn't be easy to allow imports of live animals. Some say (mostly the agriculture lobby for some reason) that said deseases are even a good reason to limit imports of raw meat. –How negotiable is this issue?
* Whaling is probably one of the elephants in the room and the EU has said it would be one of the hard parts in the negotiations. What is your stance on the matter and do you think the EU will tackle this issue? –Will the EU take a similar stance in this matter as with Norwegian seal clubbing?

there IS a defined law or contract that says that YouTube needs to pay for playing music, just like any radio station or profit making business does.  they make profit, they pay money to GEMA who gives it to the labels they work for.  

its a business dispute.

YouTube wants to share in the profits from advertising, while GEMA wants a standard 12c per streamed video which would come to $700k/year which is nearly as much as the ENTIRE of GEMA's normal earnings.  so they are being greedy, and even though YouTube do make a fuck ton of money, its a bit much to ask.

#2 (it's a question concerning Austria, and I'm to lazy to translate): Verstößt die Pflichtversicherung bei der SVA für Selbstständige nicht gegen europäisches Recht?

true,noggernogger,null,null,"&gt; All the places online that I've found in Frankfurt seem to have just VWs and Mercedes. Is it even possible to rent a non-German car in Germany?

Yes, definitely, all kinds. Europcar and Sixt have the DS3, but each station has a different selection of cars and they do not list all models online. So you will need to give them a call and ask if they can arrange something.

Also some Citroen dealerships will rent cars, so could try that option as well.",0,1316478476,null,0,false,0,c2l40i6,t3_kkwc3,t1_c2l40i6,t3_kkwc3,1427621541,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2
