Hier z.B. ist eine Beschreibung von Satans Schield, die ihn mit dem Mond vergleicht, mit einen Bezug auf Galileis Entdeckung des Fernrohrs:
    He scarce had ceas't when the superiour Fiend
    Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield
    Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,
    Behind him cast; the broad circumference
    Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb
    Through Optic Glass the TUSCAN Artist views
    At Ev'ning from the top of FESOLE,
    Or in VALDARNO, to descry new Lands,
    Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.
   
Deutsche Übersetzung online bei [Zeno.org](http://www.zeno.org/Literatur/M/Milton,+John/Epos/Das+verlorene+Paradies/Erster+Gesang), 1843 von Adolf Böttger:

    Kaum schwieg er still, als schon der Satan sich
    Zum Ufer wandte, den gewichtigen Schild,
    Groß, breit und rund, und von ätherischem Stoff
    Am Rücken tragend. Hing der breite Kreis
    Doch auf den Schultern, wie des Mondes Scheibe,
    Wann sie durch's Glas Toscaniens Künstler sieht
    Des Abends von Fiesole's Gebirg 
    Und von Valdarno, neues Land entdeckend
    Sammt Fluß und Bergen auf dem fleckigen Kreise.

Das wäre ja das kleinere Problem in der Übersetzung bzw. auf den geänderten Horizont des heutigen Lesers nimmt auch kein Übersetzer Rücksicht. Sonst müsste man diese weitgehend durch Internet-Meme ersetzen. Verloren gehen eher Sprachspiele (die deutschen Übersetzer von Asterix sind schon nicht schlecht, strecken aber manchmal die Waffen). 

Nebenher: Wenn sich das reimen soll, hat sich die Aussprache seit damals aber gehörig geändert.

Die Aussprache des Englischen hat sich allerdings seit dem dem 17. Jahrhundert sehr geändert. Das amüsante dabei: das heutige Queen's English ist vom damaligen Vorbild am weitesten entfernt.

Shakespeares und Miltons Sprache klang eher wie eine Mischung aus dem heute als ""Pirate Speak"" bekannten West Country Accent mit der Melodie des Irish English.

true,CountVonTroll,null,null,"AFAIK, you can *take* the pictures of individuals without asking in advance, but you need to get the permission to publish them afterwards if you might do so (yes, this includes your personal blog). Since the individual can never be sure what you will do with the pictures, you have to delete the pictures you have just taken if they tell you to.

Note that there's a difference between taking pictures of individuals, and pictures that have individuals on them. The latter is OK, but you mustn't crop and blow up the section with the individual afterwards. No, this isn't exactly a clear cut definition. If someone asks you to delete the picture you have just taken, do it, and get permission to publish if there is a possibility you might want to do that in the future and only very few are clearly in focus.

Generally, be aware that privacy, both legally and perceived, works differently over here. You have something like an inherent copyright to pictures of yourself, the same goes for data about you (e.g., your address).

Use common sense.

There's the law, and there is common practice.

For example, I live in Leipzig, and there's the annual WGT each Pentecost weekend, when thousands of goths roam the streets. They happily pose for pictures, and those can be found all over the Web. Neither are they getting payed for this, nor do they sign a consent form or the like, and nobody worries about it. The point is, they are aware of being photographed, and know the pictures might get published. You should probably tell them if you plan to make a commercial ""Hot Goth Chicks"" calendar out of it, though.

That's what I mean by using common sense -- make sure the person you're taking a picture of is aware of it, and don't take permission for granted. If you can't do that in advance, say, because you want the subject in a natural pose, like somebody reading a book in the park, approach them afterwards if you plan to publish it.

hamburg:

* schanzenviertel (ex-rebel-quarters, student-district, great flourishing area)
* kiez/reeperbahn (former/still red-light-district, not as bad/dangerous as in the 80s/90s...best musicals in the world situated here)
* the harbour..landungsbrücken/docks..(beachclubs overviewing the elbe)

berlin is a big ass city..4million ppl, 40miles across (2h by publ. transp.)

hamburg, more cultivated and suffisticated, big student community..

Just an example, there are more. We just have to be relentless. With the new European citizen's initiative we even have a formal tool for our projects.

The point is that the overwhelming majority of people do exactly nothing, except maybe complain. In Germany, for instance, less than 2 million people are organised in a political party. As a Pirate, you certainly know that usually less than 10% of the members are actually active participants, i.e. in Germany alone less than 200,000 people make up the political caste. No one is stopping voters from taking a more active role, the parties even try to get more members. But people just won't do it. Because politics is work. You need to convince people and form majorities. That's *hard* work. It's easier to just keep complaining.

Even among Pirates there's often a twisted mentality. I remember when we discussed raising the membership fee at the federal congress in Hamburg in 2009, some people complained that they had to pay for their sports club, their reading club, their whatnot club and that they couldn't pay a few more bucks per year to the party... talk about priorities.

Personally I think that closer economic and political ties with our neighbours is always a good thing. After all, it's not like they're going anywhere soon. Opinions among the wider population are evenly divided between ambivalence, positivity and negativity at ~30% each, but the Eurosceptics are considerably more dominant in the media.

There's a long history behind the EU that colours the discussion of it to this day, which in turns decides public opinion.


It started badly when De Gaulle worked against UK EEC membership in the 1960s, partly for domestic reasons and partly because he was wary of cultural differences and American influence. Naturally this invited some patriotic posturing and the Conservative party set up the Anti-Common Market League, which did exactly what it said on the tin. Then as the EEC became the EU, EU leaders were keen to sell it as a social enterprise, which Thatcher's Conservatives took against and the Left Wing took to. That right-left divide on the EU lingers to this day.


Fifty years later and that seed of patriotic posturing has matured into a vehicle of xenophobia, absurd at first but gaining more converts as the EU begins to spread East. (A more palatable anti-European meme has been that it reduces independence and democracy, or that the EU is incompetent because of its size, which have interesting parallels in the smaller state ideology of the American Right.)

A major cause is that nearly all the major newspapers here are strongly Eurosceptic - to the point of inventing scare stories about the EU. I wouldn't like to speculate on the reason why, but it's interesting that it's not only papers owned by Murdoch and other billionaires, but also many leftist papers as well. As you can imagine, a constant stream of anti-European headlines and columns efficiently manufactures more Euroscepticm.


Of course, there're other elements: the ex-Empire mindset is still strong here, and the fact that we're not part of the mainland is embedded somewhere deep in the national psyche. But my money's still on the public discourse and history of the issue being the prime contributors.

Couple of other things - a couple of our major press barons (Rupert Murdoch &amp; Richard Desmond) have strong eurosceptic views &amp; have therefore published hundreds of BS stories about the EU over the years in the lowbrow &amp; middlebrow press; and the British as a whole are generally respectful of the rule of law, but at the same time don't like to feel it poking in to every aspect of their lives. Because the EU is set up along lines of directives rather than laws (the individual member states implement those directives under national law), it can grate a bit on us Brits - there's a feeling that in the more social-democrat countries of continental NW Europe, they don't mind the sometimes over-prescriptive rules; in southern &amp; eastern Europe, they perhaps ignore the rules when it suits them to do so.

Case in point...we went to Granada, Spain back in 2007.  We arrived at around 23:45, and given that we had been to spain couple of years before and knowing that life didn't really start til midnight, we expected to find restaurants opened.  Shockingly, we entered a couple of places and they both said they were closing at midnight.  At the 2nd place we were really surprised so we asked the waiter---why are you closing at midnight?  We thought bars didn't close til 6am....
Bartender says, is a new EU directive.  We can't be open past midnight. Of course my british friends went apeshit, and as they told me, ""you see, this is what happens when the EU takes over.  They start taking away the country's cultural identity.""
 
Anyway, we had to go to another side of town to find restaurants open as those for whatever reason didn't violate the Eu directive.  
Granted---I have no idea if the bartender was talking the truth or not, but my point is that I think brits believe that the EU is there to take away national pride, and that's one reason they are eurosceptic.

Now, given the number of muslim refugees/illegal immigrants pouring into Europe now, and given that most of them have 3, 4 children, and most are all on welfare, eventually europe might turn to  shariah law, so all that cultural identity will be all gone anyway. :D

So I don't want to give more power to the EU until it is governed by more accountable and representative democratic body.

The governments proposing are already elected, and while making the EU Parliament the prime power might be worth a discussion, we'd need to have truly EU-wide parties before it'd be able to elect a stable executive.

Yes, she had some nice ideas and did some really encouraging actions. Unfortunately, on other subjects, her party have some positions that not a lot of people agree on (me included).

They lean towards alter-globalisation. For instance: decrease retirement age, turn off nuclear power (I don't think it's realistic. Decrease it, ok), big education reform (might be good, but I'm afraid of the risks of decreasing the level)…

before you can start learning to drive you have to have an eye exam an do a first aid class. you will also need a foto.

To get your license in germany you have to pass two tests. a) the theoretical one. The theoretical test is 30 questions. The questions have different difficult levels and will give you a different amount of error points (between 2 and 5) if you mess them up. You can have up to 10 error points and pass as long as you don't fail two questions worth 5 error points. You have theoreticall classes were they work with question sheets that have all the possible questions but in the actual test they get mixed up and might be worded differently. You have to do 14 theoretical lessons to be allowed to do the theoretical test and a lesson is 90 minutes. Clear the test and it is on to:

b) The practical test. Before that you need to do the practical lessons. You drive A special car with extra pedals for the teacher on the shotgun seat. Usually on a parking lot first but later on in traffic. How many lessons you need is up to the teachers. But in addition to the usual lessons you have to do a certain set of special lessons: 4 hours on the autobahn. 5 Hours driving out of the city - the bigger streets between cities. 3 hours in the dark.  when your teacher decides you are ready, off you go and take the test.

the test usually lasts an hour, although this can vary a lot. I had friends only drive for half an hour while myself had to endure one and a half. In addition to your teacher on the shotgun seat, the stately aproved testobserver is sitting in the back and giving directions.

things that might come up and you have to be able to perform:
parking on a big lot, parking parallel, performing a u-turn, breaking late and all that stuff. If you fail, you will know instantly and your teacher will drive the car back to the school. if you fail, you have to wait 14 days before you can take the test again. 

usually all those lessons amount to around 2000 euros.

Omg omg!!! Diese geldgeilen Bastarde!

&gt;Ihr Gejammere über die vermeintlich desaströse finanzielle Lage und ihre Weigerung, Versicherte der insolventen City BKK aufzunehmen, erscheinen damit in einem neuen Licht

Genau, die Verarschen uns doch alle! Und das so kurz vor dem Wochenende!

&gt;Tatsächlich ist die Finanzlage in den ersten beiden Quartalen traditionell besser als in den letzten beiden... 

die... die... öh.....

Ein mehr als dürftiger Artikel. Eine nach Aufmerksamkeit heischenden Überschrift als Aufreger um dann im Verlauf des Artikels abgeschwächt zu werden. Im großen und ganzen scheint es mir, als wurde er einfach schnell und ohne Substanz dahingerozt (in etwa so wie mein Kommentar hier).

tldr des Artikels: Die ersten Quartale eines Jahres sind oft von Überschüssen geprägt, die unter Umständen in den letzten beiden Quartalen aufgebraucht werden.

&gt;  that global energy-related carbon emissions last year were the highest ever

...and Germany's were lowest ever. Despite only 7 GW nuclear capacity at the moment.

&gt; So what does Germany’s government decide to do?

It decides to kill solar energy, *while* exiting the nuclear exit exit (confused yet?), with 2022 being the slowest exit the red-greens already agreed upon.

Doesn't make sense? That's Germany's government, in a nutshell.

&gt; Shut down terawatts of low-carbon electric capacity

7 GW. Renewable produces up 15 GW at the moment. So, nothing has changed. FWIW, total Earth demand is at 16 TW (that's not electricity, that's total energy) at the moment. 

Meanwhile, the elephant in the room is gas, oil and coal. Neither nuclear nor renewable have been able to make much a dent in it.

&gt; Bowing to misguided political pressure from Germany’s Green Party

Actually, the voters handled Merkel her ass. She held it as long as she could, and the exit is not really an exit, but it's the Washington Post. No clue, but plenty of spin.

&gt; German environmentalists cheered

They didn't, actually. Because they recognized the so-called exit as the transparent lie it was.

&gt;  satisfied that the government will be able to scale up renewable energy sources 

Correction: the government is busily killing solar at the moment. Confused? That's Germany's government, in a nutshell. Don't try to make sense for it, for there is none.

&gt; out that renewables would have to generate an incredible 42.4 percent of the country’s electricity

It's already at not-so incredible 17% and the number 42.4% is pulled right out that think tank's ass. In practice what counts most is meeting demand peak most of the time, and solar already does so very nicely.

Which why, at the moment, with 4 nuclear plants out of 17 running there are no brownouts. 

&gt;  result in about 400 million tons of extra carbon emissions by 2020,

So let's wait until 2020, and let's check up on the number again, shall we?

&gt; Germany is also likely to import more power from its neighbors,

Likely, huh. So where are the numbers, my dear.

&gt; since sometimes the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine

And sometimes it's sunny and blustery, and there are plenty of exports. And it can happen at the same time: export in the north, and import in the south, or vice versa. So far, Germany is net exporter.

&gt; predicts that after shunning nuclear, the Germans will end up buying electricity generated in nuclear plants in nations such as France.

And I predict the exact opposite. I also predict that Anne will be ousted, and that Areva will continue to receive taxpayer support orelse it goes bankrupt.

&gt; Germany’s overreaching greens

Yeah, these voters. How dare they vote the conservatives out of power? I mean, who gave them *the right* to violate the god-given order?

&gt; Panicked overreaction

Right, these *panicking* Germans. Running around screaming. Not.

&gt; countries aiming to provide their citizens with reliable, low-carbon electricity 

Just as reliable as in Japan, right? Because these reactors are back online, and the agriculture and fisheries are unaffected? 

Or just as reliable as Chernobyl, which is not exactly online either, and in fact costs 5% of Ukraine's GDP yearly, after all these decades.

Things seem to take a lot longer to get sorted than I'm used to.

Also one specific piece of information that you might find helpful, that said friend has recently discovered: General bank cashiers, that in the UK are trained to deal with most situations, in France are not: We went to the bank, and I asked the cashier to cancel one certain direct debit for my friend. A month later companies were contacting her demanding their money: the cashier had cancelled ALL the direct debits!

The French are very friendly and very welcoming and supportive . They are very polite and they can be very formal . Providing , of course , you are civilised , friendly and polite with them . If a French person says you're 'trés sympa' then you have made it . The French are very community minded . They are private people internally but love living outside externally . A difference I'm sure you will experience and appreciate . 

Be aware that the French \ Continental ethic is different than the Anglo-Saxon USA ethic .

A French story : the old number plates were organised such that the département no. was at the end . Paris being 75 . The Parisiens complained that when they went into the countryside , down to the Med. etc. they would be targeted - high prices , bad service - on the basis of their number plates . So the national government issued new plates that did not have any département indication . And the départements provided them with backing plates with the département crest and the département number .

That's such a sweeping generalization it makes me sick. The French are more intolerant of people who don't make an attempt to learn their language, than anything. I know many very hospitable French people.

Very true.

Yes, but not entirely free, either.

Depends entirely how far you're going. Trains aren't cheap, though, and budget flights are often cheaper than equivalent train tickets.

Try to get someone else (HR, integration assistant) to do as much of it for you as possible at first. For a country that talks a lot about the environment, France wastes so much paper for administrative bullshit that it's unbelievable. As such, keep the originals of EVERYTHING paper: bills, letters, rent receipts, pay stubs, EVERYTHING. The French are psycho about original documents.

- Start studying the language **now**. Get a book, use Michel Thomas CDs, and after a month check out France24.com and France24.com/en. Find a story you already know the context of (like US politics) and try to read it in French and look back at the English.

- With Free or SFR, you can get CNN International, BBC News, Sky News, Al Jazeera English, and France24 English. These are your main English channels but you need a ""box"" to get them. A box is essentially a package that provides you with a router for ADSL Internet, Telephone, and a TV tuner box for television access. Up to 25mbit down/1mbit up for 30€/month, no contract.

- If you are actively learning and speaking French all day, expect to be very tired mentally by the end of the day. Many people flee from this by either not speaking French or speaking the minimum. If you want to maximize the worth of your stay, make a good effort to speak and learn French. Afterwards, when you go back to the US, you're never going to say ""Man, I wish I'd spoken LESS French"" but you very well may say the opposite.

- Don't expect anyone you meet to speak English well. Most people did some English at school, but few can actually speak with intelligibility. The older the person is, the less likely they did English (and the longer ago it was). Many people want to learn and speak English, though. Some will try to practice with you. This can be a way to make friends. If you can't find anyone willing to put up with your beginner French among friends, find someone who wants to do a conversation exchange in a café: 30 minutes in French, 30 minutes in English. You can post an ad in a bar perhaps, or at the university if there is one. There is always an ""irish"" pub in every city just about so try there.

- Don't expect to be able to do anything on Sunday. Just about everything is closed. If you want food, go in the morning because those that are open close by noon. Expect to be woken up by church bells on Sunday. Sunday is family day for many. There may also be a Sunday market in your area. Take advantage of this for sunday entertainment.

It holds the islands. There are 3,000 islands in Greece and many many of them are the right size to become private paradises for the rich. That would really have minimal impact on citizens (i.e. who cares, if they cared about those islands they would have inhabited them). 

They also own large amounts of land in metropolitan cities, including Athens, which are currently more like wastelands. Selling parts of that and using the money to develop the rest for public recreational activities would be beneficial for everyone. Athens is a city with very few public parks.

The counter-argument to all of this is that one cannot keep selling their property in order to pay their debts for ever. Sustainable measures should be the priority, not selling off.

Alternatively, the state should seize (or Tax) church property. The Orthodox Church is the largest real estate owner in Greece, and I'm talking HUGE numbers here. None of this is taxed or exploited in any way of course.

notes: 

a) there is also a constitutional right for all the seashores to remain accessible to the public (something like the right of way in the UK). That can/should not change, people should be able to bathe in the shores of private islands as well.

b) (regarding the church) In general, the government can seize pretty much anything for ""common benefit"" and pay off ridiculous reimbursement to the owners.",0,1307187234,null,0,false,0,c1xq5uj,t3_hr56e,t1_c1xq5uj,t1_c1xptcu,1427211430,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The city is quite well organized for bikers : there is a short-term bike location service (velov') and moving in the city in a bike is OK.

They've included Cyprus which is not within the geographical borders of Europe, but it's culturally European, then why not Armenia? They've also included Kosovo, which is a partially recognized country. Then why not the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorno-Karabakh?

true,Andaru,null,null,"Referendums in Italy can generally only be made to repeal a law, so yes means 'repeal' and no means 'keep'. Also, a successful repeal prevents the same law from being proposed again.

The green paper asks if you want to repeal the law that enables the top offices of the state to defer trials as long they have a 'valid reason'. That is, if they have something official to do they can request that the trial be moved at a later date. Of course this easily allows for a de facto immunity, and another law that explicitly gave immunity was recently struck down by the Constitutional Court.

The gray one repeals the law that enables the construction of new nuclear power plants. The government is however trying to prevent this question to be voted on by changing the law itself, so that the referendum doesn't apply anymore. This would avoid the ban on similar laws, but so far the changes have been deemed insufficient to prevent the referendum.

The red question is about the law that allows private companies to handle public water distribution. On a repeal only state/local government controlled companies would be able to handle that. The goal of the referendum is to prevent the speculation on water and turn it into a source of private profit at the expense of the citizens.

The yellow paper enables companies that handle water distribution to raise their fees in proportion to any investments they make, whatever they are.

I was checking the patients with a (female) doctor in the hospital when we saw this guy smoking in the balcony of one of the rooms. Normally there are two patients per room, so we don't allow relatives to be there while we examine them (to respect the other's privacy) but this guy could stay because his mother (the loveliest old woman) didn't speak Spanish at all.

Smoking is not allowed anywhere in the hospital (that includes the street in front of the door and the balconies, of course), and we politely asked him to stop doing it. He answered that he didn't take orders from women and that if we wanted him to stop we would have to call a male staff member.
