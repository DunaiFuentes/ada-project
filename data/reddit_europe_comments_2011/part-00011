I added hotels, main university building, university psychology building, red light districts, bars area, shopping area, the UMCG (main hospital), main cinema, main museum and main train/bus station. 

Don't worry about the language, like Stereo said, it will be hard to find someone who doesn't speak english. 
Public transportation is great but you don't have to take a buss if you're moving within the inner city ring (canal ring). You should rent a bicycle or go by foot; there is enough to see. 

The red light district isn't that bad. There are actually two districts; the muur/hoekstraat and nieuwstad but both districts are just one street. There is a really big chance you'll cross the nieuwstad because of the main route (Folkingestraat) from station to inner city, which crosses it. 
For us 'Groningers' it is just part of the city and you could even take a quick peak, but don't take any photo's =).

[This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onP-DBkt_bw) gives you a good view on the city 'feeling', from 2:13 you see the inner city part or 'binnen de grachten' (between/within the canals). 

I hope you'll enjoy the city. Groningen is an awesome place to live in as a student and probably a great place to live in as 'stadjers' (locals). Feel free to ask for adding specific points.

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"Where I live (Denmark), it goes like this: Hospitals and health clinics are run by the regional governments (of which there are 5), and paid for by the citizens of each region by their income tax (around 8%, I believe).

Every citizen has a mandatory public health insurance identification card, and they show it every time they go to the doctor or are hospitalized for whatever reason. All journals and information about the patient is registered in one central place, so all hospitals can access them if necessary (health clinics need access permission, which they get when you pick a doctor — happens every time you change your address, or on demand).

You can always go to the doctor, and it never costs you anything (no fees at all), as long as you have the public health insurance identification card. The same goes for hospitals.

Medication given outside of hospitals is not covered by public health care, though — most people are members of a private health insurance that supplements the public health insurance for this exact reason (they also subsidize things like glasses, dental work, and other secondary medical expenses).

Now, needless to say, there's a limit to the capacity of the public hospitals, and they always prioritize according to severity. Heart diseases, cancers, serious injuries of course always have top priority. To combat this limit, there is a really neat system in place: If the waiting time for a specific procedure is more than 1 month, the hospital will give you the option of sending you to a private hospital for quick treatment (at no extra cost to you).

I experienced this first-hand when I had a hand problem (tendonitis) about a year ago, and the best the public hospitals could do was 2 months, which under normal circumstances would be OK, but I'm a pianist, so it was sort of important that something be done — so I was sent to a small private clinic, and I was treated within a week.

true,finisterra,PORT,Portugal,"Well, the standard ""it's different depending on the country"" answer applies. I can tell you about how it works in Portugal though. It is likely similar to most other countries, give or take. Plus, and since I can anticipate the distrust, the health care system is perhaps one of the things that we got that works and is in good ranking (which is why they are trying to end it).

So, everyone pays taxes towards public health care. Everyone has a ""health card"" which is presented when using the services. You have a family doctor in the health centre of your area of residence (although sometimes you end up in a ""waiting list"" until such a doctor becomes available, until then your appointments are dealt by the ""pool""). Theoretically this is were almost everything is supposed to happen: you make an appointment, the family doctor sees you and prescribes meds and analysis. Analysis and speciality consultations are often made in a public hospital. The biggest problem here is the waiting time, depending on the speciality it can be a bit high (but things like oncologic problems have close to no waiting time).

The meds are subsidised, and so are the analysis/tests/samples. Most of them are free. Actually, in a hospital everything is sort of free, give or take some process costs here and there. This includes hospital beds and surgical interventions. Regardless of any other shortcomings, nobody enters an hospital thinking about the cost.

A major problem is the tendency to rush to an hospital as an emergency instead of going first to a family doctor, which clogs hospitals.

I will happy to provide any more details. I have had close friends and family members with rather serious medical conditions (cancer, hearth problems leading to surgery, etc) and while there are certainly some kinks, and the quality of treatment isn't as uniform as one would hope, the simple fact that monetary issues weren't a factor is indescribably reassuring. I'm sure other European countries have even better systems, but I'm happy with the one we have got (in broad terms, there is great room for improvements in several areas, but I'm talking about the universal nature of it).

A different problem is the ability to pay for medicines: even if highly subsidised, there are people (generally pensioners who receive the minimum pension since they never did any discounts) who must choose between buying first-need items and their meds. This is a shame, of course, but is not directly linked with how healthcare works, it's more a reflection of the very low median income.

Perhaps you also want something regarding public/private relations... this is a hot topic, and will continue to be so. The State contracts services from private health firms (say, blood tests or imaging, even some interventions). This is especially true for areas in which there is a large waiting list. However the dynamics of public/private relations is a highly political subject, since most people that talk about ""creating synergies with the private sector"" tend to oppose public healthcare in the first place. Some experiences with ""public hospitals under private administration"" have not given any visible results to speak of.

Doctors, in general, prefer to work in a public hospital, or at the very least *also* work in a public hospital. The reason is that the equipment, specialisation areas and overall experience is better. Private hospitals pay better though (on average). 

One additional detail: the ""health card"" thing I said above is true, but nobody can be refused treatment. This applies to legal and illegal immigrants. So, the right to healthcare of anyone in national soil - not necessarily nationals - trumps the need to have an ID card. I'm unsure how far this goes though, but AFAIK there is no set limit.",0,1299512010,null,0,true,0,c1jp4fp,t3_fz0ng,t1_c1jp4fp,t3_fz0ng,1426967602,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Well, private clinics — almost exclusively they are specialist clinics, for instance I went to an orthopedic/rheumatological clinic specializing in athletic injuries (under which injuries as a result of playing the piano could be said to fall :P).

&gt; Also, wouldn't doctors say, let me start my own private business as it might make them more money than being at a hospital, or are they paid the same?

Some doctors might do that, but the prices paid by the public health system to the private clinics are fixed and negotiated for everybody once, to avoid blowing up the public budget. I don't think it's necessarily a much more profitable way to go, but some might prefer it for other reasons, such as the freedom and the flexibility of working in a small clinic. Of course, in cases that aren't covered by the public health care (such as non-reconstructive plastic surgery etc.), you can make a buck. ;)

Oh, also, many doctors want to work in the public hospitals where the interesting research opportunities are, and where the expensive equipment is available. I forgot to mention that many of the larger hospitals work directly with the universities (also publicly funded).

&gt; And finally----for new immigrants---how are taxes determined, if they are unemployed?

Taxes in this country are always determined based on actual income. If you earn 0 DKK, you pay 0 DKK in tax. :) But you gotta eat, so that's never the case. If you get a regular-paying job, you report the salary to the tax authorities, and then your employer pays the correct amount of tax for you automatically. If you're self-employed, you set aside the money that you're supposed to pay in taxes, and then when the year is over, you report how much you earned in total, and they tell you how much you gotta pay (hopefully less than you set aside during the year). :P",0,1299512669,null,0,false,0,c1jp63f,t3_fz0ng,t1_c1jp63f,t1_c1jp25z,1426967624,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

You have an ambulance in every neighbourhood (ambulance may not be a good term, later on that), there are two of them in 5 minutes walking distance from my house, where you have your family doctor and some basic test facilities like blood, maybe rentgen and urine.

In essence, your doctor works one shift every day, one day morning the other afternoon. You just come there and wait your turn which can be instant or after an hour during the winter epidemics. He examines you, sends you to the hospital for advanced exams or gives you meds (which you pick up at any private pharmacy, they are all connected so it's paperless). Most of the meds are heavily subsidized.

Students, elderly, the unemployed and other groups have free extra insurance which means you pay less or nothing for stuff like meds, hospital stays and exams. If you don't have it stuff is cheap nonetheless, since a doctor visit is around $3. I had to go to the emergency room and had a CT, ECG, blood and several other test and it cost me around $50.

Some services like dental are subsidized so you can go to a private clinic and do it for free, but you pay out of your pocket for extra stuff.

The bad side is that the government is reducing rights and more and more stuff will be paid from your own pocket.

true,blue1_,EURO,European Union,"Italy:

Health care is managed at regional level (there are 20 regions in Italy). Quality of health care is uneven in the country. Roughly, it is of good quality in northern Italy and of less good quality in the south.

More or less 20% of all public spending (national) goes into health care.

We have a general pratictioner, that one may choose within the limits of places available (usually 1 doctor per 3000 persons). You can go there for free, without appointment, usually on five half-days a week. Doctors visits at home rarely, only if really needed (i.e. for old people etc.)

Drugs are classified by type. Most important types e.g. antibiotics can be bought at a flat price (a couple of euro) with a GP prescription. Others must be paid at full price.

For urgent night and week-end necessities, there is a similar city-wide GP service that you can call on the phone (""guardia medica"").

All emergency care at the hospital, and ambulance transport if needed, is free.

For all non-urgent needs (e.g. diagnostic examinations, specialist visits, etc) there are two choices: you can require it at a public structure, which is cheap but usually implies a waiting list (of very variable length), or you can go the private route, pay the full price, and have everything quickly.

Edit: all this national health system is funded by national taxes, which are distributed to the regions, which actually pay the health care and accumulate enormous debts :)

&gt;The National Health Service or NHS is the publicly-funded healthcare system in England. The term is also commonly used to refer to any other or all the national health services in the UK but there has never been only one system since they were created in 1948; only the English system is named without national qualification.

&gt;The NHS provides healthcare to anyone normally resident in England or any other part of the United Kingdom with most services free at the point of use for the patient though there are charges associated with eye tests, dental care, prescriptions, and many aspects of personal care. The NHS has agreed a formal constitution which sets out the legal rights and responsibilities of the NHS, its staff, and users of the service and makes additional non-binding pledges regarding many key aspects of its operations.

&gt;The NHS provides the majority of healthcare in England, including primary care, in-patient care, long-term healthcare, ophthalmology and dentistry. The National Health Service Act 1946 came into effect on 5 July 1948. Private health care has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance: it is used by about 8% of the population, generally as an add-on to NHS services. In the first decade of the 21st century the private sector started to be increasingly used by the NHS to increase capacity. According to the BMA a large proportion of the public opposed this move.

&gt;The NHS is largely funded from general taxation (including a proportion from National Insurance payments). The UK government department responsible for the NHS is the Department of Health, headed by the Secretary of State for Health. Most of the expenditure of The Department of Health (£98.7 billion in 2008-9) is spent on the NHS.

true,VomisaCaasi,ESTO,Estonia,"Estonia:

Free health care is provided for anyone who either works, is under 18, has reached their retirement age, is pregnant, or proves that he is looking for a job while being unemployed. It's all covered by social tax, 33%, of which 20% goes to pension funds and another to 13% health fund (Haigekassa). There's also private entities, although few bigger clinics, that are mostly used by the rich and by companies that provide extra check-ups for their workers (general and work related stuff). Dental care is free for everyone mentioned above except for the ones who actually pay for it. Ambulances and critical emergencies are free for anyone, even down to heart surgeries. I've had one instance of dealings with ambulance in the recent years a couple of months back, when we were celebrating friends birthday at a house, which was pretty much in the middle of the nowhere. About 5km of dirt road to highway, which was inaccessible because snow for smaller cars, and it still kept pouring. At some point, guys started messing with eachother, and after a while one dude started complaining having a pain in his back. Lest to say, he was quite drunk by then. He himself took it upon him to call the emergency, and as the phone had ringed a few times, he somehow sobered/wised up, and thought of not going through it and ended the call. About 45 minutes passed, and bam, we had an ambulance car next to our rented house, paramedics jumping through the door to give their assistance (I recon they've upgraded their system so that even highlights the missed calls and then triangulates signal to get location). By then, we already knew our friend was ok, and had instead made a sick joke, so we were all pretty embarrased and apologetic. 

This is an exception, though. For the past 2 years, I've myself had something unfortunate going on with my body that affects my physical as well as mental performance. Hence, I've gone through 10+ doctors, in both public and private system, have had a surgery, so hopefully I can bring some insight to this discussion.

Initially, there first line of our public health care consist of family doctors, which deal with the most general issues. I think everyone is entitled to one, even if you are not a citizen, but in some places their workload is amazingly high, so that they might not be able to threat you with best of their abilities, and sometimes 5 minutes of their time is all you can get. In case you have a health problem that requires higher specialization, the family doctor will hopefully suggest you someone experienced, provides you a recommendation letter, and then it's up to you to make an appointment to that specialist. 

Now, it depends on what kind of issue you might be having, the usual wait-time is around a month and sometimes even higher, much higher. In my own dealings, I've found that it's wiser to through private system. I call the clinic up, get an appointment in 2-3 days, pay about 30-35e, and meet up with a highly recognized doctor who is doing a side job from the public sector. Most of them will direct you to their hospital (the same deal you would've gotten if you cba-d to wait for a month), but even then, the treatment that you'll be getting will be better. On a downside, they sometimes prolong with this, do all sorts of analysis on the site, and occasionally even drift the discussion towards politics or economy, while you're paying them 60e per hour, which indeed is quite ironic. The biggest problem is that since you visit your family doctor only once, you will have no one looking at the bigger picture.

Now, if you're need of complicated surgery, the real fun starts. Due to low wages in our public care quite large amount of doctors have left the country for Finland, which means the rest of them who have stayed are overworked, grumpy and generally don't really give a shit. This is especially true for those who started in the Soviet era. The younger ones tend to be pretty sympathetic and do indeed treat you as a human being. Now, If you sign up for a surgery that is not critical, you'll be put into a waiting list. The wait-time usually depends on a field, but I've heard of cases where it took more than a year. Personally, for me, it took about 8 months after signing up to get my wisdom teeth pulled out. Fortunately, if you indeed are in a need of urgent care, you'll be landing on the top of the list. However, although you might as well died waiting for your surgery, the quality of treatment will be on par with something you'll receiving in the West, and there isn't anything you can't really get. After the surgery, although I've heard most European countries offer some kind of recovery treatment, well, this is almost non-existant in Estonia (except for the private gigs).

What comes to the mental health, this is also under-founded. Most of the buildings look like they have suffered from a earthquake. The staff usually seem to care, especially if the doctors and nurses are post-Soviet.

About medications. The health care system will pay % of your prescribed drugs, up to 100%, but mostly 50%. They recently introduced electronic prescription system, where doctor logs on to a website, finds you through your personal ID number, adds a prescription to your name, and then all you need to do is show your ID card at the drugstore to get your meds, so there's thankfully no need to carry a separate health card.

Premetto che io non sono mai d'accordo con una rigidità ''per partito preso'', considerato che tutti noi esseri umani siamo esseri fallibili e che dunque, in quanto tali, commettiamo continuamente errori ai quali ci deve essere data la possibilità di rimediare.

Guttemberg però si è dimesso perchè, da sua stessa affermazione, non ce la faceva più a sostenere la compromissione della sua reputazione.

Nel mio Paese, che amo tanto, invece, il ministro dell'istruzione può affermare candidamente di essere andata a fare gli esami di stato a Catanzaro per avere una via piu facile.

penso anch'io che a volte si corra il rischio di affidarsi ''più ad un titolo che alle reali capacità''.

Ma, a parer mio, un incidente burocratico, come la mancanza di validazione di una laurea, è cosa ben diversa dal copiare una tesi di dottorato che è il resoconto di quattro anni di lavoro sul campo; lavoro sul campo che non hai mai svolto se non sei in grado di rendicontarlo.

E' come se il tuo dottore non avesse mai preso un bisturi in mano prima di operare te. E, non so tu, ma io allora non mi farei toccare  :-)

Conosco bene il mondo accademico italiano e le sue leggi non scritte e so cosa vuol dire essere una mosca bianca perchè non occupi quel posto per tradizione familiare. 
E quindi non credo che il titolo faccia la persona, ma al contrario la persona faccia il titolo, ossia che conta quello che hai imparato per arrivare ad avere quel foglio.

Ma anche se siamo purtroppo consapevoli della situazione del diritto allo studio in Italia (le borse di studio sono state tagliate dell'89%), siamo costretti a fidarci del curriculum, potendo testare le ''reali capacità'' solo a posteriori.
Infatti il titolo non è garanzia di ''reali capacità'', ma secondo me, non avere il titolo presuppone di non averle di sicuro.

Io voglio battermi per il diritto allo studio, affinchè tutti possano davvero accedere a qualsiasi titolo, se hanno la volontà di lavorare per guadagnarselo, imparando così a fare il mestiere.

In bocca al lupo per la tua operazione!

as an immigrant I don't feel I have to leave the country first to get a feeling that the selfperception of germans is strangely shifted towards pessimism. 

Actually every couple of months one can randomly come across an article in the fuilleton or some blog article in which the author is wondering why on earth one of the most advanced and safest and stable and well located countrys of today is flooded with grey faces. 

Mostly this is blamed on 'demons of the past' which drag down many a spirit, but i guess, as you mentioned, a good bit is caused by a rather narrowmindedness in the media and the way they're used to present themselves in public. While it of course is important to carefully critisize the political, environmental and sociological developments in your country (actually i think this is partly a reason for its great success), in germany there seems to be a general agreement of being generelly unsatisfied. Regardless wether we're talking about private circles or public gatherings, there is that almost melancholic tendency in the room to say that the one who's got something to name and shame, something to be dragged down by is more of a man than the one who admits satisfaction, or happiness even, which is caused by little things, or the fact that, well, not *everything*'s bad, actually. 

Of course this is a broad generalization, and if you talk to the right people or walk into the right corner in town you will find the people who are optmists bursting with sunshine, but this bit of a grauschleier remains an undeniable part of the impression we have come so accustomed to.

true,Rhoe,null,null,"Look, when you breed strains for superior yield, they are not sharing *magic*. They are sharing acquired *genetic* components, recent or otherwise. You are selectively breeding from the natural variety displayed by all living creatures. 

Wild animals tend towards mixed litters, however subtle.  So you pick the one with the characteristic you want and breed it with a similar one, until they true breed. Then you start the process again. The natural variety comes from both the shaking up of parent DNA as well as random mutations that feed the whole process. This is all you do with plants, except the smaller breeding period means you can really go crazy with it. 

The difference with GM is that we aren't doing it through exceptional breeding, we are expanding the gene set to include organisms that cannot breed with the target, like a bacterium. So we can move that gene into the new target, see the results. Test it. If it works, keep it, sell it, feed some people. A gene just translates into a section of protein after all. ""A sqrt symbol works just as well in my equation as everyone else's"" as its been said. 

And for fucks sake, its not poison. That's a blanket statement if there's ever been one. The safety of the crop is an individual organism basis - whatever toxicity that gets revealed should be caught by the regulator. And it does good enough. In 2008, no ill effects had been reported after 15 years of GM crops. No study has shown a statistically significant (ie not natural variation) increase in adverse effects compared to controls. 

In case you've got a nice peer reviewed, non-disgraced research piece to show the class? It'd be the first piece of real world evidence shown in the discussion.

Finally, the topic of ""farm factory workers"". I could not give a fuck about you're first world problems. We're talking about feeeding people who have only ever known hunger. Unemployment of a few beats death of thousands everytime.

And yes, its scaremongering when a place like Zambia turns away Maize because it is scared of GM. A crop that is safely grown in 11 countries and distributed worldwide.

Essentially there is too much lobbying for us to get the truth and all the facts.   They would certainly not tell you that it is unsafe.

 From what I have read studies in  animals have shown that their are problems and consumption has been linked to organ damage and cancer.    They have not been proved safe.    

Also animals have to be forcefed gm food because they naturally reject it.

true,B-Rabbit,SLOV,Slovenia,"When we were talking about joining the EU, we also had those people who didn't want us to lose our independence. We've now been in the EU for 8 years and I'll tell you this: you won't lose your independence, at least not most of it. The general laws are still passed by the individual countries. Things like the penal code, government structure, etc. are mostly decided on by the individual countries.  
There are some EU laws, that all the member states must abide. They are however generally good laws, things like the minimal requirements for buildings, roads and things like that. These laws are made by the EU parliament, where all the countries debate and vote.

The EU supreme court can overrule any decision by any court in a member state. This is regarded as a good thing, because if you think that the decisions of your countries courts were unjust, you can complain about it. You can also complain if the legal process is too slow.  
  
Switching to the euro made it easier to trade with other Euro-zone countries. It's awesome when you go to another country and don't have to exchange your money. There were some opinions, that switching to the euro caused the recession, but that's nonsense. The euro lost a lot less value than our own currency would, because it's backed by countries like Germany.  
  
The Schengen border made it incredibly easy to trade and travel. There are no customs between the countries. You can literally just take your bike, go to another Schengen country, buy milk and then return. There are also no additional taxes to pay if you buy something in another country (in person, over the internet or any other way). We are removing the control booths on our borders, because they're empty now. You'll hardly notice that you're in another country.  
  
About the foreign companies: we do have many companies that are going under, but that's mostly because of bad management. Austrian stores like Lidl or Hofer are very popular, because they're cheap, but people still buy in our own stores. The EU also allows you to do busyness with other EU countries.

Nice goal, but I don't see how GM crops will help with that. Global lack of food is only a minor reason for famines. Distribution, price-protecting destruction of food, paying farmers not to grow crops/produce milk, corrupt local dictators, dependence on aid handouts replacing local economies, independence.

Current GM crops are grown to sell pesticides and are used to feed pigs, chickens and cows in the ""first world"". Around 80% of GM soy is being used in animal feed.

You threw it out there and I called you on it, don't get hissy because I became condescending. I knew you had shit all to call with. You could spend all night looking for studies, but you'd only really need one good one.  

And on the topic of Creutzfeld-Jakob, you have a disease ripping through Europe's agriculture without any pesky scientists causing it. Just farmers trying to squeeze everything out of their product. It turns out you can get radical dangers popping up in a short time frame from purely natural farming, with no genetic engineering at all. *Well I'm shocked*

And as *I* said before : Genetic engineering by artificial selection or by laboratory experimentation is the same principle, but with an expanded gene set. No amount of ""organic farming"" is going to meet the needs we have of it in an acceptable timeframe, so you grab a useful protein from something else. If it were mixing of two compatable plants, you'd have no issue whatsoever. Luckily because of common ancestory, we can just throw that family tree a bit deeper and grab what we need. So maybe we can have a herbicide resistant maize this year, instead of in 60, or 80, or however long it takes for serendipity to strike. 

And the sqrt point - I will have to remember whatever country you're from excommunicated Analogies from their culture? 

Finally, there may be a translation error in you're use of the word ""minor"". We just do not have enough food for everybody alive today, even if we had a perfect transporation network with low prices. Borlaug said it, and its as true today - we're going to hit the point where we can farm every piece of arable land and still not meet needs, and that's where GMO has to take up the banner, and the sooner the better, since we're talking lives per minute we could have saved. Was he in this massive conspiracy you have propagated or was he just an individual loony celebrated by governments and scientists worldwide?

PS I'm posting in r/europe because its the developed world that gets to decide between themselves how they are going to handle food for the future. Nationalism is a good way of making sure you can put gas in your car, but its a terrible way of making sure you're neighbour can get food in their bellies. You can have misgivings about the food you put in you're body, or the environment you live in, but don't deny the same choices to those who have no alternative.

This wasn't even an apple vs orange comparison, you were comparing fundamentally different things. 

Pressing every bit of food out of the planet is only delaying the inevitable. You might get x% in growth which is eaten up by population growth in no time. Increasing the area used for farming will destroy the environment even faster. We cannot survive in an artificial Disney-like world where everything is fields and forests used for wood production -- that all is a pipe dream. In  the end we need to revert population growth to a sustainable level. We can manage to do that on our own or it will happen due to famines and war. Genetic engineering is not a way out of this situation even if it was only done by do-good idealists who really want to end hunger. But it's done by Monsanto and other ugly companies (Good show dodging the mosanto suicide thing) who are only out to earn more money, create dependence on GM crops and literally *own* the food chain with gene patents. Wake the fuck up.

edit: until you get the difference between you're and your you should maybe cut down a bit on the ""translation error"" jokes..

edit2: another more on topic thing: with traditional farming and GM crops we're putting more calories in form of oil into the ground (and production) than we get out of it in food.

true,CountVonTroll,null,null,"Complicated, yes, but I'll try to explain it anyway, at least the way I see it (born in the mid 70's in the West.)

So, what's being German, after all? Historically, we're a collection of some of the Germanic tribes. Others settled elsewhere and their language branched off. Language, as it happens, used to be the primary factor that made you German until not too long ago, even though the various dialects aren't mutually intelligible unless they're geographically close (Luther took great care to create a version of German that could be understood by as large a number of people as possible when he translated the Bible.) Most of the other cultural characteristics are not universal -- food is regional and traditions are very local. In the [Holy Roman Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire), allegiance was to the local ruler, not to the emperor. Look at the maps, it was a terrible mess of a few large states and a plethora of tiny ones. The Wikipedia maps aren't even detailed enough to show all of the borders. States used to fight wars against each other even in Napoleon's time. You can see this if you look at the [American Revolutionary War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans_in_the_American_Revolution) and the support the two factions were getting from different German states.

In the early 19th century, the progressive idea was to form a German nation state, based on the rule of law, with a constitution by the people. Within the political spectrum at the time, this was the leftist fringe, with royalists on the right. This also marks the birth of German nationalism, before that you would have to be e.g., a Prussian patriot or a Bavarian one. The attitude at the time is pretty well expressed in the [Deutschlandlied](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutschlandlied), which is often misunderstood. *Deutschland, Deutschland, über alles* (""above all""), for example, refers to the idea of forming a German nation state, as opposed to the status quo at the time. In 1871, the nation state finally was founded, even though the various states it consisted of remained, as they do to this day in one form or another.

Put differently, until 140 years ago, there simply was no Germany anybody could have been patriotic for.

Anyway, two world wars and a holocaust later (only 74 years!), nationalism became somewhat unfashionable. After all, the Nazis were ultra-nationalists and after the War people were eager to distance themselves from anything that could lead to the suspicion that they used to be Nazis when it was still cool.

But the real break came with the post-War generation. The liberal student movement of the late 60's was different in Germany from how it happened in other countries in that the post-War generation confronted their parents about their (personal) past, and finally began to process the history of the Third Reich. As a part of this process, a lot of the blame was laid on nationalism, and the concept itself was questioned. Mainstream opinion was, and to a large extend still is, that nationalism is a very primitive emotion rooted in prehistoric tribalism which you only express if you have no achievements of your own, is not based on reason, and almost always yields negative results. Why would you fly a flag, after all? Odds are, somebody walking past your house already knows which country s/he's in.

So, that's the climate I grew up in. I had no role models, and there was nobody in my personal environment, that ever expressed even a hint of patriotism. The very few people that I've met who did were pretty dumb and indeed had nothing else they could possibly be proud of -- if the mainstream rejects patriotism, it turns into a brand that is owned by the far right, which in turn fuels the rejection by the mainstream.

Since then, this has softened a little bit, even though in principle it's still there. The World Cup 2006 marked a turning point. See, over the years, the German flag has practically turned into a symbol for our football team, and with the World Cup taking place at home, it suddenly became socially acceptable to fly it during major sporting (read: football) events. I've heard parents complain that they had to attach flags to their car due to pressure by their kids who were too young to understand the ""complexities"" of the issue.  
Somehow this has rubbed off, and the attitude is a little bit more relaxed. There's no shame, but no real pride, either. I think this is a good middle ground, it's a healthy relationship to our country, but with enough distance to keep a good perspective. There are things that invoke national pride (""Made in Germany""), but it's not something that is seen as self-evident as it appears to be in most other countries.",0,1299727962,null,0,false,0,c1k3tbf,t3_g0l5j,t1_c1k3tbf,t1_c1k19wv,1426974658,606,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,606

Guiseppe è nato al 19 Marzo 1876, e Caroline è nata intorno al Novembre 1875. Purtroppo, non so quando sono stati sposati, neanche apprositivamente.

Poichè vorrei utilizare questi documenti per l’applicazione della cittadinanza Italiana, farei la richesta di ottenere questi documenti come una copia certificata.

Inoltre, vorrei chiedere di contattarmi via e-mail per farmi sapere a quanto ammonta la spesa di spedizione.

Vi ringrazio in anticipo per la vostra gentilezza ed efficienza.

Maybe the origin of that is the big taboo about WWII and bad ""we"" were.

The world cup in germany allowed more people to show pride without regrets, because the organizers tried to show how ""open towards the world"" and multi cultural germany has become. So the new positive national pride is that we are proud of being not hateful but open hearded. Its kind of a non-pride national pride.

As a result we've become too scared of upsetting others to realise that we're restricting ourselves. In the meantime, the cross of St. George has been adopted by the far right. This means that the flag has gone from being something that other people might not like to see to something associated with despicable acts. As in Germany, nationalism is largely associated with Naziism and Fascism but for different reasons (namely that we fought against it and it was demonised, then afterwords proved righteous to be so as justification for things like the bombing of Dresden).

As well as this, the cross of St. George is a crusader symbol which with a significant muslim population is again seen to be a bad thing on our part. Now in any population there will be idiots and nutters. Unfortunately our media seems incapable of distinguishing between them and the rest of the populous, instead drawing on colour of skin or religious belief. Consequently all muslims are painted as being the same as the nutters that just preach hate all day long. A typical conversation between a journalist and a nutter would go like this:

&lt;journo&gt;: I need some comment on flying the English flag over mosques. What do you think?

&lt;nutter&gt;: This is an outrage! Your flag is the flag of the crusaders! You will perish in hell, infidelic scum!

&lt;journo&gt;: *puts down phone*. *writes headline:*""MUSLIMS HATE CRUSADER CROSS, SAYS RESPECTED MUSLIM COMMUNITY LEADER""

No, I shit you not. This happens. A journo recently resigned from the Daily Star over this type of shit being pulled.

All of this then leads to an overreaction whereby people are too scared to say anything like, ""You're talking to a nutter, you stupid journo"" or ""Fuck off chowdry, it's our flag, if you don't like it don't live here"". Instead we're brow beaten into being told that nationalism is wrong and not the English way, and that it's only reasonable to fly the flag when the football's on.

Add to this the fact that successive governments have tried to strengthen the statehood of other nations within the UK by giving them parliaments, assemblies and funding for this, whereas England isn't treated as a country (the correct term is 'the regions').

Yeah, I realize the issue is much more complex, and that those who are protesting are getting fucked over themselves by exactly those who caused the mess.

Regarding the press, you can imagine that the examples that you get to see are hardly representative. The examples of Greek reporting that I get to see isn't exactly flattering, either.

At the core of the German outrage were the cooked books. To realize how deep home that hit, you have to understand the German relationship with currency, which has its roots in the [hyperinflation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic) during the Weimar Republic. This is deeply ingrained in our collective psyche. I was brought up to take it as a fact that without a stable currency, economic hardship, dictatorship and war are almost inevitable. It was *extremely* unpopular to give up our DM for the euro, and a lot of this resentment remains to this day. So, when it became known that the Greek government had falsified that statistics, people saw their worst fears confirmed.

Of course, the other factors contributed as well. Germany really was in a bad shape. It's much better now, but unemployment was at 13% in 2005. The East had 20%, and even today it's still in the double digits there. The improvement we've seen over the past few years was made possible by the very unpopular policies I've mentioned above.  
You know how some former smokers are especially anti-smoking? It's the same effect. The expectation is that Greece has to do the same thing. Try to put yourself in Merkel's shoes when a voter asks her why he has to work until he's 67 when we can afford to bail out a country where they protest against a raise to 65.

Apart from that, personally I don't see how this is supposed to work, either, and frankly my impression is that the goal is just to keep Greece afloat until the other threatened countries have stabilized enough to withstand a Greek bankruptcy. Unless those three underlying problems are fixed (corruption, nepotism and tax withdrawal), it would just be throwing good money after bad. I share the view that this is *the* opportunity for necessary reforms, and without the pressure, there is no way for the Greek government to push them through.

One aspect of this is that organizations that have the goal of abolishing the constitution can be declared illegal, which is why there are restrictions about the display of the swastika (the party symbol of the NSDAP) outside of a historic, educational or artistic context (computer games aren't considered art, but movies are.) 

There was a lot of emphasis on this transition to dictatorship, both on the technical process and on the contributing factors that made it possible (various flaws in the constitution which we discussed in detail, the economy, nationalism in regards to the [Stab-in-the-back Legend](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stab-in-the-back_legend) and the Treaty of Versailles, lack of democratic tradition (*a democracy without democrats*) and so on.) Then there was the build-up to the War, how other countries reacted and why, but not much about the military aspects of the War itself.

The Holocaust obviously was discussed as well, again with an emphasis on the path taken beginning with discrimination right after Hitler came to power, to the murder of 12 million by industrial means.

A growing movement of Nationalism was ignited by the actions of Napoleon and the success at war, along with Prussia's long standing historical military background. It was from this that the development of the German confederation began to emerge.

Ah oui, on aime bien les prépositions en français.

D'une manière générale, c'est une langue assez littéraire, beaucoup moins compacte que l'anglais. Il faut lire pour l'apprécier. D'ailleurs, si je peux te donner un conseil... dès que tu en sauras assez pour parcourir un text en français, même si tu ne comprends pas tout: LIS!

Processing (or is that not a typo?) is what's inefficient. The most efficient processing is: farm grows stuff which either goes to market or is canned in re-used (not recycled) jars.

I guess I have an old-fashioned 19th-century view of nation-states: they form the most convenient units of governable self-governance.  Larger, and you start getting the issues of different national cultures imposing on one another, as seen whenever Republicans get elected in the USA or in the arguments between EU nations with intensely different economic situations.  Smaller, and powerful outside influences make your mini-states or city-states difficult to govern as independent units, therefore vastly increasing the difficulty of providing democratic legitimacy.

I suppose I should be more accurate, and note that what worries me more than mere union or federation is the increasing tendency, both at the international scale and within the democratic nations, to hand more and more governing power over to unelected judiciary and executive bodies rather than elected legislators, officials, and committees.  It seems to me that we sometimes end up with entire countries making policy based on a mixture composed more of court rulings, NGO recommendations and intellectual fads than democratic representation.

Your opinion is that of a liberal socialist. Just how precisely can you judge the Hungarian democracy from Slovakia? Why don't you write about the nationalist ramblings of Fico and Slota? If anything, i would expect the Slovak media to show a very biased view on Hungary. 

About the law:
""It could also smack media organizations with crippling fines if their coverage was deemed to be lacking sufficient ""balance"" or respect for ""human dignity.""""

Not true. The media authority cannot issue fines for ""lack of balance"". Human dignity is well defined in Hungarian (as in German) law, and Hungarian courts have a long standing routine in deciding what is against human dignity, and what is not. 

""The law would have required all domestic and foreign-owned media, including websites and blogs, to register with the authorities""

Not true, it never was a goal to force blogs to register. But if you want to operate a TV station in Hungary, you had to register it even before the law. Its common sense, if you create a company, you have to register it with the tax authority. If you start a TV station or a newspaper, you have to register it with the media authority.

""Moreover, all this would be interpreted and enforced by a new five-member ""Media Council"" -- each member tapped by the party that steers parliament""

The media authority is chosen by the parliament, and its an independent authority. I find it strange that you question the independence of the media authority, yet complain that the Hungarian government is messing with the independence of the central bank (even if it is actually not, and whose leader was placed there by the previous corrupt government). Why did you not complain then, that the previous government placed one of its own people to head the central bank? Would you please even suggest, who the police chief should be? Btw, there is a ""public media oversight board"", which controls the state owned media, and its members are delegated by opposition parties too, they are guaranteed to have members on the board.

All the criticism about Hungary has come from socialist-liberal circles. Its a big european political game. Fidesz is the member of European Peoples Party, while the opposition is socialist. If an EU socialist politician can further his party in the EU parliament, by attacking Hungary, he will do so.

""What is missing inside the country, we get it from the EU family. That is where the pressure comes from. And there needs to be that pressure.""

Peter Balazs is a politician who worked for the socialist government. In this he admits, that the socialist-liberal political side (his side) in Hungary have lost all their credibility (due to years of corrupt governing), and their only hope to influence Hungarian internal politics, is by lying to their EU political friends, bringing Hungarian internal political themes to the EU parliament, and using foreign pressure.

For students, T-Shirt and Jeans is fine. If it gets hotter, shorts and flipflops as well.

Attire is usually rather plain with dark and solid colours (black, dark blues and grays) with t-shirts being an exception (can be white, coloured). The warmer it gets, the more colourful the attire gets as well.
Large prints on t-shirts shirts are usually rare, though a bonus if funny/witty. However, usually not wearable in a professional setting (check your coworkers).

Attire greatly depends on the department you're in. Business/Law tends to be all businessy (slacks, shirt, dress shoes), engineering/science not so much.

When in doubt, wear nice jeans, sneakers/dress shoes and a (polo)shirt and you'll be good. See how your fellow researchers dress.

Something I've written in [another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/fo5nn/american_heading_to_weimar_for_a_semester_in_just/):
&gt;Sweatpants/Tracksuits/Jerseys/Running Shoes: Unless you are going to/coming from sport or you're at home (i.e. not when you've got someone over), don't wear them. NOT in public/uni/whatever. US Students like their sweatpants a lot, in Germany they're a lot rarer. Unless you're going to a game or Germany is playing soccer, nobody's wearing a jersey (except maybe for sports) And running shoes are for running, not for wearing instead of sneakers.

&gt;Going out: For guys it's long pants with no sidepockets. Jeans are ok. Shoes is nice sneakers or leather (less common but totally ok), definitely closed toe. (T-)-Shirt needs to have sleeves.

&gt;Outside (for a BBQ, going to the park): Free for all! Shorts, sandals (not so much but are ok in this situation), flipflots, any kind of shirt. No sweatpants (seriously)

&gt;University: Depends on the temperature. The hotter it is, the more relaxed the ""dresscode"". Pretty much everything is ok, except for the usual (tracksuits, sweatpants, jerseys, sandals). Observe your fellow students. Jeans, sneakers and a (t-/polo-)shirt are always appropriate. In the summer, exchange jeans for shorts if you want and sneakers for flipflops.

&gt;Everywhere else: See University.

&gt;...

&gt;Nobody wears a hat/cap indoors (ok, a few people do). In a professional setting, it's again a no-go.

Tuition (if any) is usually 500 Euro per Semester. But I think it's only a handful of states (Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria do) charge it.
The rest (usually somewhere between 50 and 150 Euro) is administrative fees. Public transportation access is usual but not not everywhere and rarely the whole state.
Usually it's in the area of the local public transportation group (which is quite a large area). Sometimes it's limited to special times (e.g. from 7pm to 5am and weekends), though you can quite often buy a special student ticket for around 100-200 Euros that gives you 24/7 free access for the semester.

Still pretty darn cheap compared to everything else.
