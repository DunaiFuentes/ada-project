Any major movements in their currency (either up or down) will destroy their economy in the short term.. if their currency tanks, they would have wished they joined the euro back when it was like 1.60 euro to the GBP.. if their currency skyrockets... people will enjoy buying cheaper stuff for a month or so.. then they realize that their exports are drastically decreasing.. companies are shutting down and people are being laid off..

You see.... somebody making 2000 quid per month back when the GBPEUR was 1.60 effectively had the purchasing power of 3200 euro per month.. Today they currently have about 2300 euro per month.. You know those holidays you used to take and now can't afford? It's not really the countries getting more expensive (yes.. prices are rising overall everywhere due to inflation).. it's because the GBP is becoming weaker.. and eventually if the GBP loses even more value and they make the sane decision of changing to the euro.. the damage would have already been done... it would immediately show that the UK has become much poorer over the years and this is why the politicians want people to think the euro is bad... If they had joined before.. 2000 quid would have been 3200 and now it's gonna be 2000 euros or so.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Conscription is still practiced in some European country? I thought it **was** abolished. 

Now re global police force, I mostly agree; there are interventions I do support though, like the Libya one, but this is with UN mandate. 

Without it, I don't think an intervention is acceptable - though if its only some permanent member vetoing it with the majority wishing to approve, I'd consider an UNGA vote sufficient mandate (""Uniting for Peace"" style procedure; it would be even better if we had a proper UN parliamentary assembly to vote alongside GA). So I'd certainly be perfectly happy with having something like a 'triple lock' like the Irish do, of not being able to deploy army outside EU's borders w/o the parliament and UN approving it (along with all heads of state ofc, like now). 

With an UN mandate though, I think it is absolutely necessary to have some kind of forces to implement its resolutions, and peacekeepers just don't cut it in some situations. The alternative is prob many more deaths in bloody genocidal conflicts still so common on this primitive planet. And logically I think, the richer should shoulder this cost more frequently.

&gt; Why not abolish ... standing armies and NATO?
&gt;National defence could be carried out by little more than an all-volunteer militia that could be raised in times of real emergency .

Well, I am unsatisfied now having NATO aligns Europe with fighting their imperialist wars, but I don't see how this is politically possible to abolish for now, since it has some staunch supporters, like UK and at least some Eastern European countries. Perhaps this will change with time, I hope.

Now that national defense is possible with mere volunteer militia, no military tech, and no standing army, sounds totally implausible to me. Were I Putin, and Europe was just defended that way, I'd laugh at how fortunate I am, then nuke and/or trample all over the continent without much thought. I think some countries have a position to take such stance (say too small and too uninteresting to their large neighbors), but not that it could be a universal stance unless the demilitarization is done in a synchronized way with one's rivals - which would ofc be a great thing.

AFAIK, UK and France never accepted the 'no first strike' stance over use of nuclear weapons since the USSR appeared to have an advantage in conventional weapons, so they wanted to answer nuclearly if a conventional invasion happened.

damn, that is quite a terrible thing, I agree with you there. (well, though Norway is irrelevant in a discussion of an EU defense force  - prob Denmark too since they currently opt-out)

&gt;How many died (and are still dying) in Iraq due to UN-mandated sanctions, invasion and occupation?

I think Iraq invasion was never approved by the UN - though when it already happened and the country was in disarray, they legalized the existing intervention. Which prob seemed the lesser disaster than just dismantling everything and then just packing the bags, though they prob just ended up making it even worse over time (certainly didn't have any plans of exiting it as quickly as possible under Bush, but wished for continued occupation)

Now whether sanctions were a good approach initially is a different matter - seems to have had no positive effect, and obvious negative ones, I agree. But surely any country is free to ban or allow trade as it sees fit with another government, its just a question of whether it was in good judgment or not - so this is different from an invasion, where the question is when it can even be legally done.

&gt;Why is it OK to attack Libya, but not Syria, Zimbabwe or North Korea?

I'm not sure it isn't OK to attack Syria; the situation seems quite analogous, except for the geopolitics of it preventing it from happening, and perhaps yet not being a credible claimant of any power. I think it was OK to attack Libya among other things also because Libyans are now actually grateful for the assistance (unlike Iraq, Afghanistan etc), so I can conclude it was mostly correctly done, and had much much better consequences than sitting on one's hands and watching a slaughter.

In the other two cases, I'm not convinced, since there isn't an ongoing and bloody conflict there. Internally oppressive regime or not, its not up to others to decide how they should live, as long as it is legitimate. When they themselves however remove legitimacy of a regime, say by a powerful revolt, it does become an international and regional issue, since countries have a choice as to which of the claimants they'll accept, and the crisis has consequences to surrounding countries.

In any case, its not up to any such outside rules of thumb to decide such matters, but on limits accepted and specified in international treaties. Including ofc UN Charter itself, giving power to intervene in case of threats to peace. They themselves signed such treaty, and hence accepted being subject to such judgment. I think it gives better results than complete international anarchy, on average, though ofc more integration over (very long) time will hopefully happen, and we might actually live in a civilized world one day...

&gt;The days when bloodthirsty Bolsheviks might have rampaged over the whole of Europe are long over. There is no realistic threat from that mangy old bear.

Under current circumstances, I'd completely agree. But we're presuming the entire Europe just demilitarized unilaterally. I think even that old and now again ascendant bear is quite capable of taking on that petty resistance, or at least it could with nukes. And I don't see any reason at all why any rational ruler wouldn't do so if given such a clear chance.

Isn't italy using the MMP system like Germany, Scotland etc? This should mean you have a vote for a person and a vote for a party; half the parliament are individual winners, the other half is filled from the party list so as to make the result proportional to the votes for the parties.

This should be a pretty decent system (well apart from that majority bonus lunacy he introduced)- on the one hand ensures smaller parties are represented, so can easily emerge and challenge some failing option, on the other ensures  most or at least most prominent representatives of large parties need to legitimize themselves to the electorate directly, rather than just be on good terms with the party hierarchy, as you describe. (though I think open lists like used in many other countries - nordic, netherlands, switzerland etc - are better, for reasons I won't go into)

I presume 'choosing the single member of parliament' you mention is just the british/US system? That is imho infinitely worse than MMP; for eg, it treats a small political option strongly concentrated in some area much more kindly than equally sized or larger one which is dispersed (say some local/separatist vs some moderate political option), it doesn't ensure the winners even have majority backing unless the system collapses into two parties only, which are then difficult to challenge however bad they become, coalition governments are hence rare, which limits the consensus building in society to mere polarization - because a small option focused on particular issues which would easily come to an agreement with a partner on a programme acceptable to both their voting bodies, and so having real majority backing rather than 'best among the bad' choice, cannot exist or influence politics, personalities of individuals are  overly emphasized rather that positions and issues, etc..

&gt;it's basically a separatist movement at heart. Their wish is to transform Italy into a federal state and the only way to do so is to keep B. in power and grab him by the balls with their share of the electorate.

Highways (indicated by GREEN signs and names like A1, A2...) almost always require a toll: you'll have to get a ticket at the entrance station and use it to pay the toll at the exit station. If you lose the ticket you'll have to pay for the longest possible stretch on that highway. You can also buy prepaid toll cards (""Viacard"") to pay quickly and they often have dedicated exit lanes.

Fuel is generally more expensive on highways, so try to refuel beforehand. Also self-service refueling tends to be slightly cheaper than serviced. 'Big brand' fuel stations tend to be a bit more expensive, but it's hard to find the smaller ones. Most, but not all fuel stations take credit cards or ATM cards.

The cheapest fuels is methane however. It is a lot cheaper, but you have to plan ahead as methane stations are far between and, well, you need a methane car.

true,specofdust,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;Spec you are missing the point.You cannot compare Focus Magazine with a group of disgruntled,uneducated,corny 'artists'.

Well, I'm not entirely sure why not. Of course one is the third largest weekly magazine in Germany, and the other is a bunch of pissed off ""artists"" - but both are ultimately just groups of individuals making a statement. The fact of the matter is though, one made what would appear to be a basically accurate statement (that Greece committed fraud) where-as the others compared the sovereign loan of €100 billion to the acts of a genocidal racist mad man. 

&gt;As it was stated the group you described as a ""bucket of cunts"" was minute both in their actions and their numbers.

As I acknowledged.

&gt;This whole thing is well blown over proportion and what I'm observing is an argument of theory and stats versus everyday living.I did not vote for this government,I did not support the criminals that run the country and yet I was gas sprayed for protesting peacefully,without molotovs etc.

Theory and stats are where the truth lies, anecdotal experiential beliefs are obviously going to be biased one way or the other due to chance occurance. You maybe did not vote for the current government, but the current government seems to be the first one in a long while which is actually being honest about how dire a situation the Greek economy is actually in, and honest about all of the under the table loans from US banks. 

You were caught up in CS gas, that sucks, I agree. I'd be annoyed, that said the Greek police have been facing fairly high levels of rioting for several years now, events like Marfin Bank murders, and no doubt most of them know someone who was injured by a rioter. I'm not justifying police brutality, it's absolutely wrong, but given the situation the Greek police find themselves in, and the level of violence which erupts from many protests, it's not surprising that crowd control measures are harming innocent people. The guys throwing the molotov's are as much to blame as the guys being hit by the molotov's, though.

Frankly, I'm surprised your police aren't going out with assault rifles. If people start lobbing improvised incendiary devices at you, and you're responding with (essentially harmless) tear gas and riot sticks, then you're holding back a fair bit.

&gt;And yet you fail to accept that the global crisis is artificial and completely patronized by big busyness and that Greece was plate smashing with Europe's and America's money.

If you actually think there is some global conspiracy to pretend that there's an artificial financial crisis engineered by the US, EU, and mega corporations, then you should be organising a revolution, not protesting. This sort of conspiracy theory ideology seems to have sprung up since 2008 - I find it very convenient that in the good times of the early 00's no-one felt there was any conspiracy, but now that things are bad, all of a sudden it's a conspiracy by big business to do..well..something.

&gt;I understand that by being British you have inherited many of your country's ""mindsets"" like the fact that you ""lost an empire"" after WWII.

Not really sure what you mean by that, we did lose an empire after WW2. There need be no quotes there.

&gt;The fact of the matter is that you should not make assumptions based on given information and not self observed facts.

You reject trust. You rely on your own individual experiences and no-one else's. But if this is the case, then you have regressed to solipsism.

&gt;I apologize in advance if I make the same mistake,but you have to understand that this country is really fucked because of puppet masters and not of the will of it's people.

While it would be correct to say that we lost colonies (plural of colony) after WW2, it is equally correct to say that we lost our empire. This is a non-judgemental, non-pejorative term. Empire is the correct technical term for what the United Kingdom was the head of before WW2.

&gt;the fact that you think you know better what is happening to our country because of ""statistics"" and manipulating and misleading google search!

Ok, so you're not going to actually make an argument, you're just going to sarcastically put quote marks around ""statistics"" and claim that I've provided a manipulating and misleading google search. Would you care to point out how the statistics I provided were wrong, or what was manipulating and misleading about the google search? You're doing what Hooverspleen is doing, ceasing to trust any reported medium which doesn't accord with your beliefs, and falling back to what you yourself can observe. If you really have that little trust in the world, and that much faith in some sort of malevolent conspiracy, then you shouldn't be discussing these things on the net, you should be looking for proof. Come back when you find some.

true,specofdust,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;I really hope you are trolling because if you don't you are either a robot or so out of touch with the anecdotal random events human beings call life.

I am not trolling. I am scientist, I understand that random events happen (in fact you could say that the entire universe is composed of lots of mostly random events). However I also understand that trends can be found within this mess, and these trends can be compiled into data, which can form the basis of theory, and be used to produce statistics.

Now you have two options in this world:

*Option 1*:

Don't believe anything you haven't experienced or reasoned first hand. Disbelieve all the media, all the politicians, all the bankers, all the scientists, all the teachers, everyone! This means you should basically abandon most of the beliefs you have, should trust almost no-one. You also probably shouldn't believe in much of the rest of the world. In fact, since you've never experienced me directly, it would be irrational under this system to believe in my existence.

*Option 2*:

Place a measure of trust in reported data. Accept that there will be people out there who will intentionally and unintentionally attempt to deceive you, and that you must always be vigilant against incorrect information, and always be critical of all new data. This is the option that allows you to live a sane life. This is also the option you are currently mocking.

J'avoue que je n'ai pas suivi les liens donnés dans les autres réponses donc je n'ai aucune idée sur la nature du business que vous voulez lancer. Pourtant, l'article 259 du Code des Impôts, du 1 janvier 2010 stipule que l'activité

la micro entreprise qui le pratique regardless de son régime fiscal (réel si on dépasse les 32.000€ de recettes annuelles et au prorata si début d'activité autre qu'au 01 janvier) n'est pas assujettie à la TVA.

They're pretty similar. The reason why Bayern is more known cause it somehow went ""viral"". 
Baden-Württemberg is known for being quite expensive due to it being such a strong federal state. Its known for a high living standart and its good education.

One thing you need to know is that the cities are small. 
Theres Stuttgart with 600.000 habitants, Karlsruhe and Mannheim with around 300.000 and Freiburg with 225.000. The rest is under 150.000.

Stuttgart is the biggest one which immediately makes it attractive. Thats undeniable. For younger people Karlsruhe would probably be the second best alternative. 
Wouldn't really recommend Mannheim as its a heavy industrial based city. 
Freiburg is relative big and has a very good University which is high ranked, but the region is rather calm. But on the other hand its a university town. ;)

From Baden-Württemberg its pretty easy to travel to france and the swiss so thats a plus.
Weather is pretty hot in the summer and cold in the winter, so skiing and that kind of stuff is no problem and you can easily find some mountains in the closer area. Especially in Freiburg with the Feldberg (mountain).

Oh, the good old Swabia vs. Baden conflict. I know some people who are going ham about it but its all jokes. Nothing really serious. Football is the main theme when it comes to that part.

Cant say much about some of the stuff you probably like to hear as I'm born in Freiburg and lived just outside Freiburg my whole live as I'm still going to school.

Hope I could help at least a little bit.

Second is Law and Justice (PiS), nationalist/socialist party with catholic overtones. Their rule, lasting for 2 years, ending 4 years ago accomplished reduced bureaucracy growth and tight control of the budget policy. They also paved a road for effective use of EU funds.

Third place is a surprise. RPP (Palikot's Support Movement) is almost one man founded party. Janusz Palikot is Polish businessman and politician.

I am very sorry about police brutality in your country - still whether you voted for a particular government or not, fact is they had democratic legitimacy to do whatever the f* they want with your budget during their term. 

In other words, they are your responsibility, and you are all financially liable for their actions. That's how your constitution works (and every other).

In any case, its a bit convenient to remember you don't like some policy when the bill shows up. Where were the demonstrations about the guy's budget plans and governance, year by year? Even stated was hardly sustainable.

&gt; And yet you fail to accept that the global crisis is artificial and completely patronized by big busyness and that Greece was plate smashing with Europe's and America's money.

hm? what? there is nothing artificial nor conspiratorial about your debt; its simply the sum of what was spent over that what was collected by taxes through your budget over some years, on those that benefit from it. And it is only and exactly the magnitude of this sum, not geopolitics or big business that makes you insolvent (simply because you would be, given this huge sum, however kind or not such factors were).

I think this was in question originally.

Ah, so an antisemite and a homophobe. figures.

&gt;You should know that there is a global law which says, in sort, that any nation invading and destroying another is held responsible and must pay damages. 

Nope. war reparations are stated in the peace treaties ending a war. They're usually imposed by the winners on the losers. UNSC can impose some though, but any codification of such right is pretty spotty for now. We didn't get any reparations from recent war for eg.

&gt;Germany is among the strongest countries now BECAUSE they never paid war damages.

possibly. 

If you read a bit on how Hitler got to power, you'd see that war reparations of WW1 were a significant cause. World just got wise enough to try breaking the cycle of resentment these reparations create, and not demand them after ww2 **in money**. Which is exactly the correct action imho. 

Still, Germany did pay up substantial amounts oof reparations, just mostly not in cash; to Israel for the horrors of Holocaust, to allies in machinery, equipment, deindustrialisation (and moving that to allied counties) etc, many POWs were used for forced labor etc. They confiscated their patents, copyrights and trademarks in significant numbers. Even trade secrets were literally forced out of their businessmen. The cost of occupation was ofc charged on Germans. Many countries took also territorial compensations.

In short, Germany probably doesn't owe you shit, and you have some convenient sense of timing in remembering to bring up claims now.

&gt;we had universities when you drank cheap beer

A lot of things have been retrospectively called universities that don't really qualify, but really, no Greece didn't have first true universities, yet Oxford is one of the oldest ones, only after Bologna, and possibly Paris. 

&gt;Those times may be long gone, but our blood remembers and it's boiling right now with the leaders of the world trying to exterminate our race.

Why would you think anyone is trying to exterminate Greeks? Since when did reforming the public sector mean extermination - I don't believe Greek deaths have suddenly peaked. Also, no, blood does not contain memories, obviously. 

&gt; There is a thing called the fault of the loaner! If you gave those money and then you and your friends who you gave it to put them in their pockets and altogether said that everything is ok, knowingly lying, then you shouldn't ask for any money back. 

I'm not sure I'm following this sentence - let me try translating. 

Person A loans money to person B. Then person A and B put that money in 'their pockets' (what? person A puts the remaining money in its pocket? or?), and says 'everything is ok' but lying (as in, stating the debt is sustainable or? then money shouldn't be asked back? 

What an interesting theory. Well, an obvious problem is that not all actors giving loans to Greece could be shown to have know nor even should have known the extent of the debt, so couldn't have been lying, but made arrangements in good faith.

In any case, if the debt is unsustainable, by definition you can't pay it back, and what will happen is a default or haircut, prob exactly to the maximal level you are actually able to pay (this is the likely near-future scenario anyway). And if it is sustainable, then by this 'story', since I find nothing to support this is any kind of legal notion, it would have been admissible.

&gt;t's called odious debt. 

nope, that's not odious debt, that's just something you invented on the spot:

""When a despotic regime contracts a debt, not for the needs or in the interests of the state, but rather to strengthen itself, to suppress a popular insurrection, etc, this debt is odious for the people of the entire state. This debt does not bind the nation; it is a debt of the regime ...Odious debts, contracted and utilised for purposes which, to the lenders' knowledge, are contrary to the needs and the interests of the nation, are not binding on the nation – when it succeeds in overthrowing the government that contracted them – unless the debt is within the limits of real advantages that these debts might have afforded.  "" (wiki)

You did not have a tyranny, you elected the fucking idiot! What is the structure of Greek budget? I'd guess a substantial portion of it is spent on Greek people. So you already profited from the borrowed money, but now consider it illegitimate debt after having consumed it? Also, nor has any regime been overthrown - you just elected a different party. Mere accounting fraud definitely does not qualify since he could have put it in the books and still do whatever the f* he wants with your budget, and since by this doctrine, even if it were a despotic regime, it would qualify as odious only if spend mainly contrary to popular interest, argument you couldn't make about Greek debt.

&gt;And greek politicians commited fraud, not the greek people. So I have a suggestion for you. Why don't you come and take all the politicians who ruled this country for the last 30 years and do whatever you like with them? I believe that you will be most welcome by the Greeks if you do that. 


Oh, how convenient, so when the bill comes to payment, you remember you didn't agree with the way the money was spent. Where were the protests rocking Greece about the idiot's policies while happening? 

Also, if you don't want something cut, how about protesting that something else be cut (military spending?), or that some other income revenue be opened (will church property be taxed with the new tax?)

The issue isn't merely fraud, but the sustainability of the total amount of debt incurred. And the government of a state has every democratic legitimacy to draft and execute a state's budget - in fact that's its primary purpose. And future governments are bound by the contracts of past governments - otherwise, how exactly would any long-term agreements possibly function, if they went obsolete every 4 years?

&gt;Germany would be financially destroyed, all the other European countries gone to hell 

haha, well, no, you're not that important, frankly. The banking sector is getting prepared to absorb losing half of Greek debt in a haircut, by the looks of it, and that'd just costs a trifling 200b € . compared to 9 or so trillion aggregate GDP, hardly something that can itself financially ruin an entire continent.

Here's his take on the regions and the peoples living along the Rhine:

&gt;Now, this is precisely what the Rhine has remained 
the spine of Europe, between the Germanic and the 
Latin worlds; the artery along which live the peoples 
that refuse to choose between Latin and Teutonic : the 
Swiss, the Alsatians and Lorrainers, the Luxemburgers, 
the Belgians and the Dutch (up to a point, though less so, 
the German Rhinelanders) . All these regions, despite 
the differences of language, history and landscape, 
evince a number of features in common. The men are 
particularly tough and stubborn, as was to be expected 
of * 'frontier tribes"" inured to attacks on both sides; all 
speak their language whether German or French 
with a peculiar accent of their own ; all have left their 
mark in the chief European pursuits, chiefly in science 
and in trade. Thus the Rhine-valley turns out to be the 
home of the most European of peoples : those who, 
sharing in the gifts of the two great branches of Central 
and Western Europe, the Germanic and the French, and 
able therefore to understand both, have proved them 
selves well endowed in two typically European features 
the will and the intellect.

true,ooli,null,null,"I have a lot of thing to tell to explain what I was trying to say. I'll try to keep it simple and short:
There is 2 things:
1st: USA is the Entertainer of the world. 
Basically I learn English just by playing your game and listening to your music. (If your TV-show had been shipped in VO , I would have speak a far better English).
So to say it in a crude way, you're country is like a jester to me: funny, entertaining, but I wont take you very seriously (except you're also the 1st military power), and I wont have any interest into having a deep relationship with a jester (aka USA, sorry for the bad analogy)
For the movies part, I know USA made some great movies, but in percentage we see a whole lot of shity ones for every good one. While we're basically spared the worst from others country like Japan, India, and others European country.

2nd: I know already anything about your country (I'm wrong, but that's how I feel it)
 Since the early 90' there was basically only 3 TV-channel in France. That mean I did not choose to consume your shows, they were fed to me. And even if we received things as different as 'Friends', Disney Cartoons, 'Love and Married', ' South Park'. At the whole, I picture your country as a very normal country with funny guys, some crazy one, some religious, some not so. I should picture every country like that, but only USA appears so complete (with nothing left to learn)
 For Japanese, I only know about the crazy stuff (I'm interested). For Brazil and Germany I only basically heard about Carnival and Oktoberfest (those seems weird, I'm curious), and so on.

In the end, it is not a value judgment about your country, It is just that it exported itself so much that it's the 'everyday normal guy' of the world.

And for the technological part, I'm sorry but I'm not interested in Japan because they invented the VCR , or Arabs cause they created the Zero, neither I am in USA for the atomic bomb or the iPhone. Those are probably great accomplishment, but nothing that would justify a trip to the USA.

In the end, as I said, I appreciate a lot of thing from USA, writers, philosophical thinkers like Chomsky now, or Thoreau and Dos Santos in the past. I could eventually be curious about your black culture, cause it produced great cultural stuff while being less exported as a whole (I only saw the cool stuff like Gospel, Rap and Blues and so want to know more about it).

Damnit, it was longer than expected and finally not that much clearer.

I can apologise now for being a year behind on my Poland/Greece comparison, I had the timeline set a little big and must have misread. My Greece/EU comparison was correct, Greece's taxation is 4% below the EU average.

You raise a valid point about the possibility of tax burden being higher on the individual than in other countries with equivalent taxation levels, however I still doubt this approaches say, Denmark, which in total collects 53% of GDP, with such taxes as a 180% tax on registering a new car. Also ultimately, if personal tax burden is much higher in Greece due to the church and businesses tax dodging, this is a problem for the Greeks to sort out.

Claiming that you have a Bundestrojaner without even mentioning your evidence is a bit sloppy to say the least.

&gt; Also, the German Government responded, saying that ""it now needs to be checked if we gone too far"". So they confirmed that this is true,

Saying ""we need to check"" != ""yes we did it"".  They never said that they are not using any spying software.  Too some extend and under particular circumstances the Government is even allowed to use such software.  The question is if (1) this specific software is theirs and (2) if they deliberately designed it to break the law.  These things are not at all clear and nothing along these lines has been admitted or implied.  Today the news say that the CCC thinks that the software very likely comes from the Bavarian state government.  So, technically, it might be a Landestrojaner, not a Bundestrojaner, but nobody knows anything for sure right now.  In any case, interesting story, let's see how it unfolds.

&gt;And they still are obliged to pay in my book, because as you very correctly say almost all the others got their share, but we got shit. 

Ah, OK but this is a different position - so here you concede that Germany did pay, just not to Greece. Ok, unfair I agree, but isn't this an injustice that you had to resolve with the Allies at the time? And the fact they still owe you 'in your book' doesn't mean they have any **legal** obligations to you still.

&gt;The Platonic Academy &lt;snip&gt;

Yes - that's why I said **true** universities - Platonic Academy is (one of? the?) oldest institution of higher learning - but that doesn't make it a university. I wasn't making much of a point there, sry for sidetracking this discussion with my nitpicking here,  I was just correcting your terminology, since I get frustrated sometimes how all ancient institutions of higher learning get called 'universities'

https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/List_of_oldest_universities

""The word university is derived from the Latin: universitas magistrorum et scholarium, roughly meaning ""community of teachers and scholars"". The term was coined by the Italian University of Bologna, which, with a traditional founding date of 1088, is considered the first university.[1][2] ""

""Although there were other institutions of higher learning, like those of ancient Greece, China, the Arab World, and other civilizations, these aren't generally regarded as being universities as they largely didn't offer degrees or they were culturally dissimilar from the European universities where the concept of the modern university came from.""

&gt;Did I, now? So how about this?

So, a Greek documentary that thinks Greek debt should be considered odious. How unexpected. Well, I just quoted you the definition of odious debt as currently applied, so I'm not sure how this adds to the argument. So, yes, please bring on your library - 

I specifically wish to see a definition of odious debt in international law that doesn't require it being incurred by a dictator, and in ways contrary to interests of the people (like personal wealth or paying for the repressive regime). (and what exactly are criteria for it then?)

&gt;You just started worrying about your little ass going to hell in the past 3-4 crisis years.

Didn't you notice the flag? I have no stake in this, I'm not even in the EU, let alone the eurozone yet. We have our own crisis, but one of real economy, not of financial sector, which is quite stable due to strict capital requirements our central bank implemented in time, and aren't particularly exposed to Greece. And we have our own excessive debt, though private external debt, not public debt. 

&gt;Because there were... and there were a lot. But the government has a unique way to control the media to show you that all is well and you believe it. But I am here. And I know!

oh, I see, OK. I'm sorry I didn't see much about this reported then. Still, you didn't get far with them, did you? Look, I'm just saying is that your governments are your business - but it was within their right to put you in whatever debt they wished really.  The time to stop them was then. But future governments are obliged by their decisions, when these are so binding, like with issuing long-term bonds, unless the previous government had no legitimacy. And I don't think you can make that case, unlike Argentina etc.

&gt;If it wasn't important as a sum or political cost for all Europe then noone would speak our name. 

Yes I was speaking of the sum of your debt. Yes, Europe couldn't afford the financial meltdown like the Lehman Brothers, only bigger, that would have happened if the Greece defaulted before the bailout, just barely exiting the crisis and having a weak and exposed banking sector. That is past though.

I simply said you aren't **that** important, in reaction to you saying how Greek debt is supposed empoverish Germany and the entire continent if defaulted. I think you were being quite over the top there, not that the Greek crisis isn't a huge mess.

It just isn't that big, considering, to actually drain Germany let alone Europe of its finances. If everyone were surprised, back in the time when the accounting fraud was just discovered, the shock could have damaged everything, yes. But now everyone expect a Greek default. I expect it to happen soon (euraktiv is now speaking of a 60% haircut, for eg being prepared). 

Now they're just quibbling over will each country pay for its banks if able and use common funds only where necessary (Italy I imagine), or will they rescue them all in common - and the reason is simply because Sarkozy doesn't wish to loose AAA rating in election year, so he doesn't want to save french banks alone.",0,1318269475,null,0,true,0,c2qcfd7,t3_l3zun,t1_c2qcfd7,t1_c2qc25c,1427712008,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

The Debtocracy documentary is what expresses the public opinion right now. I know it's just a documentary and most certainly not all even all of the Greeks have watched it. But, I know it speaks for us all because I hear the opinions of the documentary in everyday life. If you talk to an informed youngster in Athens or an old man in the mountains of Greece you will hear the same things, those that are said in this documentary. And they may never even watched it. So, I just posted it to show you what the Greeks think about the debt. It's the truth for us, but only a documentary for you... well, life sucks, boy, but I don't need your consent to accept the truth of it. I feel it in my gut every fucking day.

About the odious debt... I have just what you asked :)
http://www.cadtm.org/Topicality-of-the-odious-debt

it says among other things
""...While King’s analysis is interesting in many respects, |5|
we argue that it is deficient, since it does not allow for the inclusion of all debts that should be qualified as odious. In fact, according to King, the mere establishment of a government by free elections is enough to disqualify its debts from being categorised as odious. However, history shows, through Hitler in Germany, Marcos in the Philippines or Fujimori in Peru, that democratically elected governments can be violent dictatorships and commit crimes against humanity.

It is thus necessary to analyse the democratic character of a debtor State beyond its appellation: any loan must be considered odious, if a regime, democratically elected or not, does not respect the fundamental principles of international law such as the fundamental human rights, the sovereignty of States, or the absence of the use of force. The creditors, in the case of notorious dictators, cannot plead their innocence and demand to be repaid. In this case, the use of the loans is not fundamental for the categorisation of the debt. In fact, financially supporting a criminal regime, even for hospitals and schools, is tantamount to helping the regime’s consolidation and self-preservation. Firstly, some useful investments (roads, hospitals…) can later be used to odious ends, for example, to sustain war efforts. Secondly, the fungibility of funds makes it possible for a government that borrows to serve the population or the State – which, officially, is always the case – to generate other funds for less noble goals....""

Travelling by train: avoid at all cost Regional trains, because they make a metric fuckton of stops and are usually old, smelly and without a/c. Intercity trains are what you should use if you're on a budget, while eurostar/eurocity/frecciarossa are the best train italy can offer. Usually you can get from big city to big city in 3-4 hours with a couple of stops, the seats are comfy and the a/c is blazing like you're on the kilimanjaro. Be advised, even if the seat is reserved, sometimes people will occupy your seat just because. Politely ask them to leave and usually they do.

Travelling by car: why would you do that. No, i'm jesting. But seriously: cities are hell if you're driving a car, because for italian people behind the weel there are no laws, just suggestion from the government. Be careful whatever you do, and learn to juggle with roundabouts.

As for the food, try to avoid the obvious tourist trap - restaurants on the main street, etc - because they usually sell mediocre food at incredible prices. You can easily live in italy eating snacks (Pizza, Focaccia, Piadine, Panzerotti, Panini...), but should you find yourself desperatly craving italian food, you can surely find some good restaurant.

He's a cool guy, and the bar is patronized by people from all over the world as well as lots of locals. Not too far from there is a restaurant called ""Trattoria der Pallaro"" that has a 5-course prix-fixe menu for $35 euro and it's a fucking deal. You will barely be able to walk out.

You'll probably be able to find places to couch-surf if you're trying to save money, I know of at least one guy who does it in the Prati neighborhood on Viale delle Medaglie d'Oro, which would put you within walking distance of the Vatican and a short tram/metro-ride or walk to Piazza del Popolo.

To address your questions:

* Weather - Freiburg is the sunniest city in Germany. Unfortunately the sun has disappeared in the last few days, but I understand were supposed to have mildly decent weather for at least another week or two before everything goes to shit. 

* Nightlife - Freiburg is a university town. There are lots of bars, clubs and discos. There are also three Irish pubs here, one of which is a major haven for Americans (and other anglophones). I've been there a lot the past few weeks because I'm a huge baseball fan, and they're the only place in the city that shows the playoffs. 

* Accents - Older people may have a strong dialect. There are also some young people with stronger dialects. But it's definitely not a big problem. Most of the people you'll be interacting with, I find, speak something pretty close to Hochdeutsch. 

* Police officers - Luckily I haven't had to interact with them much. I can say, though, that Freiburg is one of the most relaxed cities I've ever been to. It's kind of like the Boulder of Germany. Pretty chill place. 

* Schools - Uni Freiburg is one of the best schools in Germany. Also, as somebody else pointed out, [this](http://www.kis.uni-freiburg.de/index.php?id=23&amp;L=1) is at the university and it's relevant to your interest in astronomy. 

* Nature/Traveling around - Freiburg is located in the ""three-country corner,"" and is a pretty good starting point for getting around. You can get to France in twenty minutes by car or train (Colmar and Strasbourg are both really close), and you can also get to Switzerland very easily as well. You can also make a day out of hiking through the Black Forest for incredibly cheap (or even free depending on if you have a Regiokarte).

hm, fair enough - though, is this directed at me by any chance? bit presumptuous if so...

&gt;So, I just posted it to show you what the Greeks think about the debt. It's the truth for us, but only a documentary for you... 

well, no it definitely sounds interesting. I just don't think its reason enough to accept its analysis though - but we're having this discussion more concretely below:

&gt;It is thus necessary to analyse the democratic character of a debtor State beyond its appellation: any loan must be considered odious, if a regime, democratically elected or not, does not respect the fundamental principles of international law such as the fundamental human rights, the sovereignty of States, or the absence of the use of force. The creditors, in the case of notorious dictators, cannot plead their innocence and demand to be repaid.

I find this part on the page you linked also clear and interesting:

&gt;“Odious debts are those that have been incurred against the interests of the population of a State, without its consent and with full awareness of the creditors.” |3|

that is reasonable, if it is supposed to catch countries where elections create criminal regimes like Hitler etc, but are you claiming Greece would qualify under that criteria? As having a 'notorious dictatorship'? Which spent money against the interests of the population. And supposedly, creditors knew of the (supposed) criminality of Greek government? Also, let us note that this is advocacy of a particular NGO that wants third world debt forgiven, not a statement of accepted international customary or treaty law, since it includes things like:

&gt;Thus, multilateral debts incurred within the framework of structural adjustments fall into the category of odious debts, since the destructive character of these debts has been clearly shown, namely by UN agencies |6|

you must be kidding me, so if IMF's loans are by definition odious debt according to their desired version of international law, ofc IMF wouldn't borrow money...

but ok, lets ignore that part and get back to where its supposed to be the case that Greek regime does not respect human rights. Lets first note its a signatory to the European Convention of Human Rights, so can be sued there about this. 

Let's see the level of freedom in that country - it is considered a 'free' country by Freedom House', it has a democracy index of 7.92 a flawed democracy - just a notch better than Italy, Polity data series gives it a perfect score , reporters without borders give it admittedly a ranking of 19, which makes it share the 70. place.

So, given these results, and considering various countries in other parts of the world, Greece is still among the freest places on the planet. Not a 'notorious dictatorship'. And how are the expenses of the Greek budget spending that money against the interest of Greek people? Isn't most of it spent on public services so in the interests of the people? And given this is a free country (relatively speaking ofc, mine isn't perfect either, far from it) - no amount of budget at all is spent literally against the interests of the people, like on repression of political opponents, or personal wealth of the perpetual rulers etc.",0,1318281756,null,0,true,0,c2qeag6,t3_l3zun,t1_c2qeag6,t1_c2qcola,1427712893,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

As for what you say about Greece qualifies under such criteria, I have to tell you that I do. Fascism is not the only way of oppression. So, they took democracy and made it into a political system so corrupt that it can favour only debt and their pockets and they made it so flawless that it took people here in Greece 30 years to understand it. I think that yes, we qualify. And if it was up to me I would hang them in the center of Athens and leave them there for the crows. All 300 of them! And if you ask any Greek they may not say ""death to them"", but the meaning will be the same, trust me on this.

It doesn't have to be a notorious dictatorship, it can be a democracy ruled by the same two families again and again! How about that? And they lied to the people of Greece all these years. And they planned together who is going up next time and how they are going to fight one another so that people think they are opposites. Bastard scums. If there is a hell, there is a special place for them.

Anyway I urge you to read this page and find out more about odious debt for yourself.

It's all there. About all countries who did it and lived to tell. And I'll even give you a hint. In Ecuador, before Corea called their debt odious and erased it, they had 5 or 6 democratically elected governments. How about that? ;)

""The IPCC reported that the effectiveness of mitigation efforts over the next two or three decades would have a large impact on the ability to stabilize atmospheric greenhouse gases at lower levels, and that the lower the ultimate stabilization levels, the more quickly emissions would need to peak and decline.[38] For example, to stabilize at between 445 and 490ppm (resulting in an estimate global temperature 2 to 2.4oC above the pre-industrial average) emissions would need to peak before 2015, with 50 to 85% reductions on 2000 levels by 2050.[39]"" [2]

I think I saw on realclimate blog once though that one could construct a scenario where we temporarily overshoot the target, but then cut back even more dramatically to OK effects, but ...

Also I think there is some uncertainty, so that basically anything between 350-550ppm might be the  upper boundary..

First and foremost, please try to accept the idea that in France, customer service is nonexistent!  I have been compiling a black list of shitty service since I got here in 2007.  It's a given that not all employees are entitled and unionized, or angry or depressed...  but from personal experience, one bad encounter is enough for me to blacklist your ass.  So here are my bank recommendations:

BNP-PARIBAS: antiquated banking systems &amp; no customer service.  I once had to pay a bill to the bank before a deadline and I did that in cash.  Since I deposited cash, I figured that the debt is payed but I still received a letter (charged 21 euros) stating that I didn't pay on time.  That letter was automatic and the system didn't update itself on time.  I closed my account.

SOCIETE GENERALE: This bank has acceptable service.  I didn't have an issue with them.  New service: direct ATM deposits at specific ATMs.  Believe it or not, it's NEW in France.

LCL: This bank let's you choose the services you need 'à la carte'.  They even let you customize your VISA with your own .JPG .  Isn't that sweet?

LA POSTE (post office banking):  This is by far the cheapest solution but service is really shitty.  Anything you need to get done has to be painful and slow.  Often you have to go back and deal with another angry employee.

We are interested in the ""agendas"" of other parties and their opinions generally.
The same goes for the Pirate Party and their election programme in Germany and
throughout Europe. A big party, like the S&amp;D in the European Parliament, which
unites Members from 27 Member States, has to work on many issues from local and
regional levels.

Actually, the S&amp;D party and the pirates do have certain issues in common- for
example, fully developed local transport or higher educational standards.

The party's most discussed topics however are the questions about internet and
new media. We are also concerned about the ongoing changes in the fields of
communication, media and electrical devices. And I can inform you: these topics
are on the political agenda and we do actively work on them. There are initiatives,
discussions and debates all about Open Access and net neutrality (to give just
some examples). Just recently there was a big discussion about the enlargement of
competences of the European Network and Information Security Agency. The S&amp;D
sees itself once again as a defender of consumer rights - also in the online world.

Concerning the closing of atomic power plants, the European Union has declared
itself to be absolutely in favour of this. You can find this position in many non-binding/
non-legislative statements. But: the EU has no legal right to judge in this area, this is

man in Österreich als Selbstständige oder Selbstständiger verpflichtend versichert
sein muss, ist es in Deutschland gerade konträr, wie du auch selbst geschrieben
hast. Hier gibt es keine Pflichtversicherung für Selbstständige.
Allein dieser Vergleich zeigt bereits die Unterschiede zwischen den
Gesundheitssystemen, die schwierig EU-weit unter einen Hut zu bringen wären.

Hintergrund für diese Regel ist das sogenannte Subsidiaritätsprinzip: Es besagt,
dass die EU nur innerhalb der Grenzen der Zuständigkeiten tätig wird, die ihr die
Mitgliedstaaten übertragen haben. Nach dem Subsidiaritätsprinzip wird die Union in
den Bereichen, die nicht in ihre Zuständigkeit fallen, nur tätig, sofern die Ziele von
den Mitgliedstaaten weder auf zentraler noch auf regionaler oder
lokaler Ebene ausreichend verwirklicht werden können. Die Mitgliedstaaten sind
jedenfalls zuständig für die Sicherstellung der Organisation und Bereitstellung
von Gesundheitsdienstleistungen - nicht die EU. Letztere wird bei EU-weit
