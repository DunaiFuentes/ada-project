I studied in Grenoble, so I know a bit more about it than the others. It really depends on where you'll be going to school, but there's a pretty big international population there. You could probably go through your entire stay without speaking too much French (can be bad or good depending on your desires). Of course the Alps are right there as well, so there is lots of good skiing in Grenoble. That seems to be the reason most of my classmates chose it. It also has very easy access to Lyon--getting there takes about an hour on the train and 9€-- as well as Switzerland (Geneva) and even Italy.

I have a cousin who lives in Pau, but I don't know much about the schools there. All I really know is that it's by the Spanish border, and is a relatively small town. Lots of natural beauty and good if you're into outdoor sports.

Non plus. Tu ne pourras badger ni à la défense (à part sur la ligne 1 du métro, qui est une exception à la règle), ni à puteaux.

Ca n'existe pas de ""ticket normal"". 
Un ticket t+ est un ticket un peu bâtard qui permet de prendre le bus, le métro, le tram dans toute la R.P (avec correspondance en plus), et le RER dans Paris. 
Le ticket ""origine-destination"" (le bon vieux ticket) permet d'aller d'un point à un autre, en incluant le RER et le train. C'est ça qui ressemble le plus aux règles d'un pass Navigo.

Apparently, most people, including leading German politicians, are a bunch of idiots who will readily accept the ""reinstating border controls"" talking point with absolutely _no_ evidence to back it up. It is extra ironic, since Germany already has these permanent offices set up, so the fact of the matter is that Denmark probably had a more loosely patrolled border than its neighbouring countries and now we're getting to the same level. Not that I agree with it, but I'm tired of seeing my /r/europe full of a bunch of clueless articles and comments by people who completely disregard facts and tell us how we're destroying Schengen.",0,1309962301,null,0,false,0,c23xlhb,t3_ihx9i,t1_c23xlhb,t1_c23xjkr,1427320050,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

&gt; IMHO ist das kein nachzuweisende Einzelaussage, sondern eine pauschale Verurteilung der katholischen Kirche. Das passt doch wie die Faust auf's Auge zum genannten Absatz (2). Liege ich da sooo falsch?

Wahrscheinlich eine dieser Sachen, die durch den besseren Anwalt entschieden werden.

1. Es ist nicht unbekannt, daß Kindesmissbrauch in der katholischen Kirche ein Problem ist und von höchsten Stellen gedeckt wurde, die nebenbei offen die Zusammenarbeit mit Strafverfolgungsbehörden sabotierte. Wer sich nun immer noch als Katholik sieht, d.h. sich mit diesen Handlungen einverstanden zeigt, der ist kein Deut besser als der, der den tatsächlichen Missbrauch durchgeführt hat. Man kann sagen: Aufrechte Katholiken sind ausgetreten.

2. Es ist nicht unbekannt, daß die katholische Kirche eine ""Sekte"" ist.

3. Und daß Kardinal Meißner gegen alles und jeden wettert und auch gerne Verhaltensrichtlinien gegen ihn Missliebige vorgibt ... nun, das hört sich schon ziemlich nach ""Hassprediger"" an.

I appreciate where you're all coming from; you want to see the best in people, you want to accept all the weak and vulnerable people in the world, give them shelter and food and a chance at a new life in secure conditions where they can practice their religion and culture in peace and harmony with us.

And that's awesome. 

Unfortunately, due to what countries like Iceland, the USA, and a bunch of 1st World States did in regard to the economy we're neck deep in a financial crisis the likes of which the world has never seen before with another dip very possibly on the horizon. We do not have the surplus finances to take in anymore immigrants and give them the benefit of a welfare state. You wouldn't invite more people than you could feed to a dinner party would you?

Surely you'd rather have the 5.5million population of Denmark have equal benefits and a welfare system that works than 6 - 7 million people who don't have a functioning welfare system?

The worst part is it's already falling in decline. Slowly parts of the healthcare system are being privatised, such as cleaning, which has led to the corporations running the cleaning of hospitals to cut corners and thus have a lower standard of quality and care. They want to cut SU for fucks sake! That's one of the pioneering qualities of Denmark! That students get free money from the government to better themselves! And that's only the beginning. Need I remind you of the recent Efterloen's Cuts and all that malarkey? 

Our welfare state is slowly being chipped away at because we've been *TOO* open and *TOO* tolerant. We weren't critical enough in who we let in, so not only do we have more mouths to feed but we more unskilled, uneducated mouths to feed which really doesn't help the economy either. You know, we only need so many corner shops and Halal Butchers.

It certainly doesn't help when a section of the minorities start getting in on the criminal scene. Sure ""Makrellen"" was whacked and a biker would get the shit kicked out of him, but at least you didn't have Pakistanis FRISKING YOU in broad daylight in Noerrebro. There is a correlation between the rise in immigration and the rise of crime in Copenhagen and surrounding areas, like it or not. There's 2008 statistic from Jyllands Posten that read that 75% of all violent crime is committed by immigrants of a ""anden etnisk baggrund"" (read: other ethnicity) - 20% of Copenhagen's population are immigrants. 

But no, all you left-wingers will look away and falsely cry ""RACIST!"" and whine about how awful DF are because all of sudden it's become so fucking trendy to be paedagoisk, trying to lie enough to yourselves and each other in your academic circlejerks that it finally becomes truth. But I'll tell you what, eventually it will get to a point where you realise that shit ain't going down how you want it to. 

All you have to do is look at England, Sweden, Germany, and France to see the future of Denmark if we don't act. It's already slowly happening - just look at Voldsmose, and that's on fucking Fyn. Like, seriously? The fire brigade can't enter some neighbours on FYN because the teenaged Turks and Somalis vandalise the trucks and assault the firemen? Fuck that, we've got to nip this shit in the bud. We don't need a situation in Denmark like they've got in England with Bradford, aptly nicknamed Bradistan, or Malmoe where the most common name is Muhammed.

About English - yes, we speak English. Almost everybody you can met on the street and isn't wearing sweat suit you can speak English. Especially young people up to age of 30. I haven't saw anyone in that age who couldn't understand English.

About Russian - yes, a lot of people understand it here, but it becomes less popular nowadays. Myself I can understand Russian just fine, but I can't speak very welll.

My suggestions on visiting Baltic states:

*  If you ask in English - you have great chance to have good reply in most major cities. Especially from younger generation.

*  You can speak to often bald people in sweat suits in Russian, they may reply and ask you some smoke. But be picky about sweat suit wearing people, you might end up robbed.

*  If you approach somebody who isn't wearing sweat suit and you are speaking Russian - it'š 80% you will get any reply and 50% chance of acquired information will be correct. Especially among young people. Older generation would say the truth.

See, native people here are very friendly, but we want to get rid of Soviet memories and two ethnic groups can't live well side by side. Some say that Estonians even have allergy to Russian language and Lithuanians are deaf when hear Russian language. Latvia isn't so picky, but still, you might end up in wrong place in all Baltic countries. We like tourists. Spanish, Indian, German, Scandinavian, Netherlanders and other.

Can't speak of any Eastern country ([Baltic states are Northern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Europe)), but Russian is widely spoken in all post-Soviet countries and Belarus people have it as main language. Their native language is dying. Of course, Russian is even similar to other slavic languages, like Ukraine.

Sad, but true. Don't even try to start a conversation in Russian unless you're quite certain that the other person/party was a Russian or you will ruin any chances of getting any information out of an Estonian than blunt yes or no answers, and we'll just avoid you like a plague. 

My tip: start with the language you know (English, German or Finnish [anything but Russian, really]) and if that initial pick of language proved to be too disastrous for communication, ask in that first language whether we spoke any Russian. But you'll still have more luck with older generations as the knowledge of Russian language in 80-90% of Estonians under the age of 30 borders mainly with some expressions for swearing.

Wallonia can't afford that, because Brussels is the economic center for Wallonia (by lack of a thriving big city in Wallonia), even though it geographically is a city in Flanders. 

Flanders can't afford that, because a Brussels that is politically separate from the rest of the region, an enclave, would necessitate endless negotiations to implement any significant policy in the region because of the central position of the city and its function as transport hub etc. So that would accomplish absolutely nothing.

Brussels can't afford that, literally.

So... competences will slowly be siphoned away to regions and/or communities on one hand, and the EU on the other. When Belgium finally ceases to exist, it will probably be so unimportant that it's just a formality.

Frankly, most of the people there (french as well as dutch speaking) would loathe the idea, because the Flemish separatists like to claim the capital as their own although less than 20% of the people here speak dutch. I think the same sentiments are felt in Wallonia.

I don't think I really understand the mood in Flanders, so I can't speak to that part. But I don't think there is a lot of support for actual independence, more for larger separation of government. You could compare it to the US where some people want more power shifted to the states.

I've been afraid for some time now that the strategy for the Flemish separatists has been to stretch out the negotiations and pointing the finger at the frenchspeaking politicians for not giving in for so long that they can somehow get to independence that way. Bart De Wever, the leader of the separatists, actually said something like ""We are willing to negotiate, but not when that means we have to give in on anything"". 

There has yet to be any sort of real outcry from the people for anything. They're were one or two demonstrations, but they didn't have a solid message, more like ""let's just make a government, you guys"". It's all kind of depressing and a lot of youths won't care as long as it's not really affecting them. I've been hoping for a long time that a student movement would stand up and take real action, but nothing of consequence has been done by anyone.

Personally, I think the idea of separatism in any form in a united Europe is retarded and every economic reasoning behind it is a very devious form of latent racism. Besides that, the separatist's economic policies are nothing short of insane.

A united Europe does not mean that decision-making powers need to stay at an inefficient and malfunctioning level of government. On the contrary, it is a united Europe which guarantees a level of harmonisation that allows the regions more autonomy on local matters.

Aside from that, the demonisation which happens through a constant coupling of any kind of separatism with accusations of racism stops all debate before it can even start.

My problem with the whole facilities debacle is that francophones think it is their right to speak their own language in Flanders. 
In those 6 muncipalities the francophones were given privileges/facilities in the 60's, so they could learn the language and meanwhile still correspond with the authorities in their own language.

true,Leovinus,null,null,"Interesting that this idea is coming from the party whos political leader is in charge of school policy, and who has worked tirelessly to create a divide in education levels between have and have-nots. Now that statement is very black and white, which i concede, but even if that work is slow and on the down-low it's still happening. I should also mention for those who are not familiar with Swedish politics that we are currently under a coalition party, and the liberals despite their name are on the right side of the fence.

Privatization of schools has meant that municipalities sell their own schools below market value, books and all, to puppet companies of large investment firms. While that wouldn't be bad, it is when it's taken YEARS to increase standardization to levels laid out for state-run schools. Although on their ways of being fixed, issues like random and overly high scores, weird and ultimately negative pedagogical methods as well as unproven teachers, general standards and quality.

Private schools can also ask fees of their students (school is ""free"" if they're municipality owned, which most were until a few years ago). This gives them an economical advantage since they, as stated previously, seldom spend money to build their own buildings and buy books, and can spend that money on adverts and gimmicky extras to attract students. All the while they still get the same amount of money from the state as the state pays for each of it's own children in school costs. I am offended that my taxes are going to private investors who are not bound to provide the same state standards for both education, food and salaries. Especially since they can close their doors to students they don't feel worth educating, i.e. if a kid has extra needs they don't want to pay for. A municipality owned school will have to provide these services by law at a regulated and guaranteed level. Granted, that isn't always the case, but i find it disingenuous to allow haphazard schooling under the argument of ""choice"". 

Another area they're working to dismantle is the folk high-schools, or folk college. Not so much by withdrawing support (which they do too) but more by invalidating grades form such schools. Why they have a different grading system in the first place is beyond me, but these grades are continuously being devalued and limiting further education.

Recently they also changed the national tests to focus more on maths. Not logical thinking. Not flexibility. Math. Oh, and if you went to folk high-school there generally is a bigger chance that maths wasn't your strong area. A lot of students study math in those schools. And these are people who need a national testing score to be competitive at all. College kids who finished with good grades already have a leg-up when applying for University, and have an even greater chance with a national test behind them.

There are also efforts to cut people above a certain age-bracket out of further education as well, or re-eduction should you want to examine other avenues of your life. What age and the restrictions they are going to set in place have slipped my mind at the moment, but it's indicative of their view on education in general that pisses me off.

What I'm saying is this: I find it incredibly hard to swallow that the one party who seems to be actively throwing sticks into the wheels of Swedish students, open their arms to foreign ones ""in a bid to attract hard-working and well-educated people"" when they've clearly made the idea of higher education in Sweden into something negative unless it's what they feel is necessary... wouldn't want people to educate themselves to much in general so that they ask for better pay, now would we.",0,1310107842,null,0,false,0,c24bkh1,t3_iitw2,t1_c24bkh1,t3_iitw2,1427326766,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

You'll end up paying maybe €10 or €20 more, but it's worth it just for the ease. The only disadvantage is that with a pre-booked company, the price is already fixed. With a taxi, the rate can be impacted a lot if you hit bad traffic. At rush hours the highway near Stade de France can be terrible just before the junction where the A86 is merging with the A1. Couple that with an accident or two and you have long tailbacks. Take out €100 in cash for the taxi - you won't need it, guaranteed, but just to be safe. It used to cost me €60-70 to get to Versailles, so central Paris will be about €50.

Tips: on the passenger window behind the driver there will be a sticker on the window with information about the taxi and who to write to in case of problems. Note down the taxi's license plate number, and the address of whom to contact in case of problem.

Also make sure you ask for a receipt when paying.

Most taxi drivers doing the ""airport run"" are good guys, but you get the odd few, especially in Paris too, who see foreigners as an opportunity to make a quick buck - taking the ""scenic"" route so the trip takes 20 minutes longer than anticipated and so forth.

Die Botschaft zum hack laut der page:

&gt;Der Überwachungsstaat stellt ein Szenario dar, wo ein Staat seine Bürger mit allen
zur Verfügung stehenden Mitteln überwacht.

&gt;In der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, die von sich behauptet ein Rechtsstaat zu sein,
ist juristisch die Wahl seiner Mittel zur Straftatverfolgung oder -Prävention eingeschränkt.
Den Rahmen für die Gesetzgebung gibt das Grundgesetz vor.
So ist unter anderem gewährleistet, dass die BRD kein Überwachungsstaat werden kann,
wie es in der DDR der Fall war oder in China immer noch ist.

&gt;Garantieren soll dies Artikel 10 des Grundgesetzes, in dem steht, dass Brief- Post- und
Fernmeldegeheimnis unverletzlich sind solange keine Gefahr für die freiheitlich demokratische Grundordnung oder der Sicherheit des Bundes
oder eines Landes besteht.

&gt;Doch Signale seitens des politischen Establishments geben zu verstehen,
dass die Unantastbarkeit gewisser Grundrechte nur eine Farce ist.
Leichtfertig werden Versuche unternommen Artikel des Grundgesetzes auszuhebeln.
So wurde zum Beispiel über den Willen der Bevölkerung hinweg mit der Vorratsdatenspeicherung
ein Gesetzentwurf herausgebracht welcher alle Bürger dieses Landes generell als Tatverdächtige sieht.
Die Vorratsdatenspeicherung sollte alle Kommunikationsdaten über 6 Monate speichern.
Kritiker dieses Gesetzes kamen nicht nur aus der Bevölkerung. Auch die Repräsentanten
der Strafverfolgungsbehörden äusserten Bedenken, da bisherige Gesetze völlig ausreichend sind und die meisten Verbrechen konventionell
aufgeklärt werden können,
Zudem wüssten Kriminelle ohnehin, wie sie sich anonym im Internet bewegten.

&gt;Vorratsdatenspeicherung. Telekommunikationsüberwachung. Online-Durchsuchungen. Erweiterte
Rasterfahndung. Großer Lauschangriff. Speicherung aller Fingerabdrücke. Biometrische Passdaten. Nutzung der Mautdaten. Die automatische
Erfassung von Autokennzeichen. Fluggastdatenspeicherung, Briefkontrollen, Geruchskontrollen, Verwanzung von Wohnungen, Zensus2011 – so schränkt
der Staat die Freiheits- und Bürgerrechte immer weiter ein.

&gt;Jedoch haben wir alle etwas zu verbergen, wir sind weder Terroristen, noch geht es
unseren Staat etwas an, wie wir leben. Wir wollen nicht, dass Deutschland zu einem totalitären Staat mutiert.

&gt;Wir möchten Grundrechte und die Privatsphäre erneut festigen. Nur so ist das Gleichgewicht
zwischen Sicherheit und Freiheit möglich.
Aus gegebenen Anlass: Aus dem immer mehr wachsenenden Missbrauch von Rechten zur Überwachung
der Bürger nehmen wir jetzt den Kampf gegen ein solches Vorgehen auf, denn so kann es nicht weiter gehen.
Anbei sind sämtliche Daten einiger Server der Bundespolizei hinterlegt. Darunter z.Bs.
GPS Daten und Karte von verdächtigen Fahrzeugen, GPS Tracking Software der Behörden, Dokumente und Verschlüsselungsalgorithmen im Source
Code der Bundespolizei. Denn es kann nicht sein, dass wir alle dauerhaft überwacht werden. Wer das Tracking system nutzen möchte, sollte sich
das htdocs Verzeichniss + die dazugehörende SQL Datenbank installieren. Die Benutzerdaten der Einsätze + Username + Passwort
(wie immer in Plain Text) findet ihr in der .sql Datei.

&gt;Diese dauerhafte Überwachung kann nicht länger toleriert werden. Ihr habt euch
zahlreicher Verbrechen gegen die Persönlichkeitsrechte und Datenschutzbestimmungen schuldig gemacht. Ihr habt die Aufmerksamkeit von uns auf
euch gezogen. Aufmerksamkeit meint in diesem Fall entschiedene Taten gegen euer Handeln.

&gt;Jede Lücke wird ab jetzt schamlos ausgenutzt, alles was wir in die Hände bekommen,
werden wir leaken um den Feinden der Freiheit den größtmöglichsten Imageschaden zuzufügen.
Solange die Regierung und die großen Firmen ihre Bürger bestehlen, belügen, ausspionieren
und nichts anderes zu tun haben als darüber nachzudenken wie sie ihre Macht weiter ausbauen und ihr Geld weiter anhäufen können,
werden wir weitermachen und die Rechte der Bürger dieses Landes wahren.

&gt;Der Moment in dem wir nicht mehr für unsere Rechte kämpfen, ist genau der Moment
in dem wir unsere Menschlichkeit verlieren.
Wenn ihr für nichts kämpft, dann kann euch alles besiegen.

&gt;Wir sind die No-Name Crew,
Wer wünscht, dass man ihn fürchte, erreicht, dass man ihn hasst. Das Bestreben, dem,
den wir hassen, Übles zuzufügen, heißt Zorn.

Ich befürchte ja eher, dass sowas genutzt wird um die Schlinge noch enger zu ziehen von Seiten der Staatssicherheit...Lasst den Wettstreit beginnen.

this is how many flamingants feel about Brussels.. Personally i don't think the language of the people is of much importance though. the fact that Brussels is a Gewest (a region with a certain autonomy)  will probably give them right to decide if they want to be an autonomous region in a post-Belgium scenario.

On the other hand, there is a thriving Flemish community in Brussels with two universities, leading cultural institutions, the political institutions etc and the well-off population segment that goes with them.

Economically though there *is* no border between Brussels and Flanders. The axis Brussels-Antwerp is the heartland of the Flemish economy. All the transport infrastructure points at Brussels.

But ironically, Brussels is officially more or less a separate Region (with economic, geographic etc. competences)... On the other hand, in spite of the significant cultural differences between Wallonia and Brussels, they are still in one Community, with cultural competences.

The best match for reality would be two entities, Wallonia and Flanders, with cultural autonomy for one (French) or two (French and international) Communities in Brussels, in addition to the Flemish one. In Wallonia that would be mirrored with cultural autonomy for the German Community in Wallonia. 
That way you get a symmetric construction, in which everyone gets what they want: Flanders has geographic integrity and the competences for its own economic policy; Wallonia still has the federal level from which to get economic support; Brussels has its cultural autonomy.

Brussels as a separate economic entity will only cause problems, because of the geographical and economic situation.

The Navigli zone (subway stop Porta Genova) is quite laid back, you can find bars of whatever kind, from pubs to more modern and hip joints. As for the people, you'll see pretty much the best and the worst. 

Other favoured drinking zone in milan are the Arco della Pace, near Parco Sempione; A few places, filled with too-cool-to-be-human people. You can laugh at their expenses! 

Then there's Brera, near the center of the city - it used to be much more for the high-up class, but these days it's as good a place as any. 

Near the subway station of Piola there are two major universities of Milan - which means that you'll find young people that wants to get plaster faced.

There are other places of course - I don't know much of the zone you're staying though.

Hungarians are frowned upon for not liking and accepting the romany rather than being helped in this disposition(people go as far as to call them Bigots!).  
The Romany abuse of the Hungarian homeland and it's hospitality only forces nationalism and facist ideological dissent amongst otherwise reasonable people.  
  
The obvious solution is radical welfare reform. And a very stringent,controversial, and in discriminatory deportation of the Romany. As well as a brutal 0 tolerance enforcement of the law.

true,almodozo,null,null,"Well, that, plus the authorities have a track record of placing Roma in separate schools, or separate classes within schools, with inferior resources and education - or outright sending them to schools for the intellectually disabled, regardless of their actual capacities. Not everywhere, of course - but those *are* problems that [have been fairly rampant](http://www.soros.org/initiatives/roma/articles_publications/publications/equal_20070329), so on one level at least you can kind of understand why Roma families have come to think : why bother.

Plus, of course, the vicious cycle aspect of this. It's not like Roma parents just think: ah, fuck education I don't want my children to learn anything. It's also that, as the article points out, unemployment is 85%. One way to look at this is: well, if they're not getting education, it's always going to be 85%. Which is true. But it's also easy enough to imagine this working the other way round as well: can you really blame someone for thinking that, if ""the way things work around here,"" none of them will get a proper job anyway, why bother going to school all these years? 

That's not a smart decision, of course, but as long as there aren't any more Romani role models of people who, thanks to education, did make it ""out,"" that way of thinking isn't all too hard to understand either. Plus, you skip the practical sides to this. With 85% unemployment, many Roma just can't afford the school stuff. And with many rural Roma living in separate ghettos, often outside the village and with incomparably worse facilities, going to school every day isn't quite as regular an opportunity.

I don't mean to just make excuses and yes, the myriad social problems within and surrounding Romani culture are real. And they contribute greatly to their own plight. But the discrimination is real too: I know from friends who are even just 1/4 Roma that, although they were participating in regular society and education in regular ways, it was a lot harder for them than for regular Hungarians, because of the discrimination and antipathy they faced. If you're 100% Roma and you look like it, it's hard to get through, no matter what your education. 

Not saying it's all ""white society's fault"" or anything, but there's definitely another side to what you are saying. It's like with blacks in the US prior to the 60s. All the things people say here about Roma, they used to say about blacks in the US in the fifties: lazy, shifty, their own fault for being dirt poor and without education, criminal, whatnot. And even as, finally, blacks got the same legal rights as everyone else, for  generations still you had to work twice as hard to make it if you were black. Still true in many places now, though incomparably less so. In the end, you did get a middle class - as well as a remaining ghetto culture with continuing cycles of failure.
