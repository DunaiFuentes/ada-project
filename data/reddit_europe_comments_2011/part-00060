1. Take a German class in Germany if you can. Do everything you can to practice speaking. Speaking German in real-world situations is harder than in a classroom.

2. What is your citizenship? If you're Canadian, the immigration process shouldn't be an issue. You can enter without a visa, but you will need to get a residence permit within the first three months of your stay. The residence permit doubles as a work permit-- you will need to have work authorization added to it when you apply. 

3. Your lack of money will be an issue. At least for my study permit, I need to prove I have 700 euros a month for study or around 8,000 euros in the bank. I'm sure a similar rule applies for those looking for work, but double-check. 

4. Continuing with the lack of funds, no permanent residence = no residence permit. You need a permanent residence with a contract signed by your landlord. Keep in mind most apartments (and WGs too, I believe) make you put down a deposit of 1-3 month's rent.

4. Berlin has an unemployment rate of 17.5% and you will not have easy access to the job market. You will probably need a job offer letter to get permission to work, and the company may have to prove that they can't hire an EU national to do the job.

As redcremesoda pointed out, speaking German in real-world situations is really hard. You'll find a lot of people who won't talk German but will start speaking English to you, after they've recognized your accent (Sorry, but mimic a native German accent is near to impossible).
If you need good money and no talking at the start of your journey, you can find good work in factories which provide parts for the car industry or other devices. Nearly every city (100thousandplus) has at least one of them. redcremesoda gave the specifics concerning the work permit. Also there is http://www.toytowngermany.com/ an English-language community website for Germany which provides useful tips.

The main blame in the liberal parts of the western population is undeniably on Kohl, the then-chancellor. In fact, he was close to get thrown out of office, and figured that if he had ten million easterners vote for him (because, who won't?), he would keep his post.

Then came the Treuhand phase, where all state-owned businesses were sold to westerners, or european coorporations (e.g. Leuna, see http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leuna-Aff%C3%A4re), sometimes for a single Mark (~0,5 Euro) or under shady circumstances. Most of these businesses failed soon afterwards, leaving millions of people unemployed.

At around the same time, with unemployment soaring, the West realized we had gotten a very problematic group of people, as evidenced in the progroms or Rostock-Lichtenhagen, where there were anti-asylumseeker riots which we only got under control after close to a week, with situations that started to resemble a civil war between the local population, neo-nazis and the police.

-	A majority of respondents (73.6%) said reunification was a positive thing. However those from eastern Germany (80.8%) have a more positive view of reunification than those from western Germany (70.1%)
-	Those with a negative view of reunification are more likely to be proud to be German.
-	Those from western Germany (71%) are more likely to be proud to be a German than those from eastern Germany (61.5%)
-	Overall 10% of respondents were not proud to be German, and 23% said German pride didn't matter much to them
-	The majority of respondents (87.8%) believe there is still a divide/gap between eastern and western Germany. 
-	Half of those surveyed own a German flag
-	A majority of those in western Germany (66.4%) would fly the national flag at a sporting event, while a slight majority of those in eastern Germany (51.9%) wouldn’t.
- 9.6% of East German respondents said Germany should be divided into two countries again, **while 24.3% of West Germans agreed with this point**
- Asked about the 80 Millionen  € pro Jahr given from western states to eastern states: East germans say: 30.8% it's enough, 26.8% not enough, should be more. West Germans said: 50.5% Was enough, now it should stop.
- West Germans are more likely (10.3%) to think that someone who has a German flag in front/on their house is too nationalist (as opposed to being patriotic), when compared to East Germans (5%).

What kind of real estate company is it ? Acting so unprofessionnaly, they probably don't even have the necessary legal licence to operate on the real estate market, which is heavilly regulated in France.

There is nearly no point in ""reporting"" them.

This kind of legal letter is usually a big pacifier.

You can always report them to the nearest police station. The cops will probably sit on it, but who knows ?

true,korto,null,null,"""""Ad hominem"" is most often introduced into a discussion by certain delicate types, delicate of personality and mind, whenever their opponents resort to a bit of sarcasm. As soon as the suspicion of an insult appears, they summon the angels of ad hominem. They may not have much in the head, but by God, they don't need it when they've got ad hominem on their side. It's the secret weapon that delivers them from any argument unscathed.

In reality, the mere presence of a personal attack does not indicate ad hominem: the attack must be used for the purpose of undermining the argument, or otherwise the logical fallacy isn't there. It is not a logical fallacy to attack someone; the fallacy comes from assuming that a personal attack is also necessarily an attack on that person's arguments.

Therefore, if you can't demonstrate that your opponent is trying to counter your argument by attacking you, you can't demonstrate that he is resorting to ad hominem. If your opponent's sarcasm is not an attempt to counter your argument, but merely an attempt to insult you (or amuse the bystanders), then it is not part of an ad hominem argument.

Ironically, the fallacy is most often committed by those who accuse their opponents of ad hominem, since they try to dismiss the opposition not by engaging with their arguments, but by claiming that they resort to personal attacks. Those who are quick to squeal ""ad hominem"" are often guilty of several other logical fallacies, including one of the worst of all: the fallacious belief that introducing an impressive-sounding Latin term somehow gives one the decisive edge in an argument.""

And what an example we have been given by Deusdies! This delicate type's ""argument"" about homosexuality, paedophilia and necrophilia boils down to the equivalent of me saying: ""I fucked my girlfriend last night and next I am coming after Deusdies' mother and grandmother"".

Perhaps Deusdies would like to tell us which countries are contemplating to allow necrophiles to parade in the streets?

Further, in response to the argument that banning the parade shows the weakness of the state he responds ""Serbia is one of the last remaining countries that still have it right"". This is not an argument, but Deusdies for sure is not able to understand this.

At the pinacle of this individual's intellectual mastery, he exclaims that he thinks Serbia is not a mess at all. This is not surprising - an individual that eats shit all his life will eventually learn to like this shit - he simply knows no better.

And lastly - I wish to thank Deusdies for pointing out that I am able to move away from Serbia if I so wish. In fact, I am thinking about it. The only reason I am still here is that I do not want to contribute to the fact that half a million thinking and able individuals have already left, leaving the country in the hands of Duesdies and such like - people who enjoy festering in the shit they have shat out.",0,1317548768,null,0,false,0,c2o7v1w,t3_kx5lb,t1_c2o7v1w,t1_c2o4lak,1427675328,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

the Parti Socialiste (socialist party) is our left wing. Strauss-Kahn for instance is a left wing/social democrat man.

the UMP party (Union for a Popular Movement) is our right wing. N. Sarkozy is a UMP man.

the last prominent party is the Front National (FN), which is our far right wing.

&gt;  and how does it compare to that of other countries (for example the US)

People who know better the topic than me say that one cannot truely compare with US politics; mapping our PS on the left wing and our UMP on the right wing is a gross simplification.

&gt; What did Sarkozy do while he was in office?

I think that the major thing people will remember is that he changed the retirement laws.

&gt; why is he being so much criticized?

I think that's because he doesn't behave the way other presidents used to, at least on the surface. Nothing inappropriate (not like our Italian friends...) but he has a new, unusual ""style"".

&gt; Do you know if he will run for a second term?

Nothing official yet, but everyone expects he will.

&gt; and if yes what would be his chances.

Polls currently say he will lose, but polls are not reliable at this point.

&gt; Who are the other candidates? 

The socialist party adopted a primary election system; they haven't voted yet, but anyway he/she will be the strongest contender. There's also the far right wing candidate, Marine Le Pen (a woman, daughter of the former president of the party). This is what people consider to be the third major contender. Because of what happened previous poll, 2002. We elect our president with two rounds: in the first round there is many candidates from all parties, and we vote for one of them. Then the second round takes place with the two best candidates of the first round. In 2002, to the surprise of everyone, the far right wing man did go to the second round instead of the socialist party's candidate.
As a result, people from the left wing had to vote for the right wing candidate, who won with more than 80%!

UMP and Sarkosy are highly criticized, for not holding the promises at the last elections, for being a pro-corporate government, for leaning towards extreme-right on the questions of immigration/security and what have you. It is currently highly fragmented on in the inside due to the recent Karachi affair, which might or might not involve Sarkosy in a corrupted campain scheme involving weapon sales. 

Extreme Right is stronger than ever but will never win that presidential race, they hold strong on a solid 20% of the population, but the other %80 would rather be fucked in the ass by an elephant than be under their governance. So no worries there, it makes a lot of noise, but it's rather harmless. Their platform is to go with the flavour of the month.

On the left side and the PS, the arrest of DSK in May shuffled the deck, and Francois Hollande came out ahead. This guy is the ex-husband of Segolene Royal, famous herself for losing the 2007 presidential race against Sarkosy, he was one of our laughing stock, and he suddenly blossomed into a serious candidate (and lost god knows how many pounds in the process), he rides all the polls, talk about come back on life. He is closely followed by Martine Aubry for the left primaries though, and a 3rd runner up appeared in the name of Arnaud Montebourg, with a speech oriented towards deglobalization.

Things are just getting started, we are rather certain Hollande will represent the left, but for the right side, it's very unclear, even though they all insist on Sarkosy, it doesn't seem sustainable as he is beaten by everyone and their grandmother in the polls. Wait and see.

Generally, children are viewed by the law and by society as unable to give consent. The reasons for this are the same as for why children can't vote, aren't expected to pay taxes, can't join the military, etc. They simply aren't adults yet. If an adult has sex with a child, it is seen as an inherently manipulative act because the child *cannot* give consent, even if he or she would like to.

Acceptance of homosexuality and acceptance of pedophilia are very different things. While they are both minority sexualities, homosexuality involves two adults who choose to have sex with one another. Pedophilia by nature involves a party incapable of giving consent. Conflating the two is often viewed as a fear-mongering or intellectually dishonest tactic, because the ""moral"" arguments against them only overlap in the broadest possible sense (i.e. ""I don't like that these people are having sex""). If you continue to present your arguments against homosexuality in the future, I hope you will refrain from mentioning pedophilia, if only to make yourself seem less bigoted.

Plus around €2 per square meter for heating, garbage fees etc., plus electricity at €0.22/kWh, water, Internet…

Regarding the neo-nazi problem, like with everything, we have stats about rightwing violence.

In 2010, there were 263 recorded cases of violent assault and two attempted homicides against foreigners by rightwing extremists, and about as many (232, 3) against their political opponents on the left (less than attacks from the left against the right).

It's true that this is a problem and that it disproportionally happens in the East (about half of all incidents, at 20% of the total population), but usually in areas where you wouldn't want to go to anyway. Not because of *them*, but because *nobody* has a reason to go there. That's part of the problem those areas have, and this is what breeds rightwing extremism. I wouldn't want to move to Bumfuck in rural Brandenburg, or into a ""socially disadvantaged"" part of a large city (like Berlin-Marzahn) even if I looked like a model-Aryan.

Even after that, you can't apply for a permanent residence directly, you'll have to go through stages. First your work permit would be tied to an employer or sector and limited to a year or two, if you're still employed by then it will become a general work permit that is still time limited, and if you haven't had to rely on welfare for too long or have turned out to be a terrorist, it will become permanent after four or five years, and you can get citizenship after seven or eight.

It's often joked about how bad the weather is, but in case you're in any doubt; over half of all days a year are over cast. Maximum temperature during summer is going to be 24c. More likely it'll be around 17c most days in summer, and around -5 - 0c during winter.  If you move to Glasgow, it will rain. A lot. If you move to Edinburgh it will be windy. A lot.

Winter nights begin around 3.30pm at their shortest. Sunrise can be as late as 9; some days it's so overcast and wet it's dark all day.

Like all northern countries, depression and heavy drinking is common. Workers go to work in the dark and go home in the dark. It's tough here in winter.

Outside of Glasgow and Edinburgh, services can be scarce. Nowhere opens on a Sunday in the religious north. Public transport is extremely limited in many areas.

That said, and if you can cope with all that, Scotland is populated by some of the friendliest people in the world. Even the busiest commuter will stop and give you directions. The short daylight in winter is offset by near 24 hour daylight in summer.  Harsh winter is offset by some of the best whisky in the world, in dome if the best pubs in the world.

The purpose I suppose is to have two forms of money, one for saving in (the euro) as its value will remain relatively stable and the other the drachma for day to day transactions, the benefit is that the drachma can be effectively inflated, labour costs can be depreciated while technically still being in the euro and still having the euro as legal tender.

The main problem with this approach is that ultimately Greece's banking system would likely collapse, the new currency might very quickly become much more commonly used and all the old banks loans were made in euro's not the new currency.

In Paris two metro lines were advertised as available all night, connecting the main designated zones for this nuit blanche:  http://www.tout-paris.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/metro_paris_nuit_blanche_2011.pdf.  And the night buses were available, at least they were scheduled to be running.

If you don't understand why Paris doesn't run the Metro all night then you haven't been in Paris very long.  Stores aren't open on Sunday (and for the most part Monday) and things aren't open very late at night.  You can't stop by a restaurant outside of normal dining hours and expect to be given a 3-course meal.

The principle is that people have the right to be at home with their families at nights and weekends rather than having to cater to every whim of the consumer at any given time.  The syndics/unions are strong here and they fight to keep it that way.  Also, there is a sort of economy in having everything closed at the same time rather than having everything rolling 24/7 or 365 days a year (c/f Paris in August).

I'm not saying it's right or it's wrong -- that's just the way it is.  And a Paris without these constraints would be, I suggest, a very very different place.  And besides, la nuit blanche is meant to be a bit of an adventure -- taking a metro, a night bus (always an adventure) and/or  walking a route you might not normally do at 5am is all part of the experience.

One can always stay at home and watch Arté instead...

I am a huge Europhile though, so the idea that the creators of the Maastricht Treaty believed monetary union would precipitate economic crisis, ultimately forcing Europe closer together is not so much an issue for me. It was a means to an end. Though I fully understand why it would leave such a bad impression on people not as pro-European as myself.

The European Union is a unique beast in government. There has never really been an sort of organization like it. It's more than an international organization, but less than a state. The closest sort of system I can see it resembling is a confederacy. This is really the first time in human history that many countries, with thousands of years of different history, culture, language, and historical strife are coming together to create what may very well end up a federal state. Perhaps there could have been better ways of advancing the European project, but that isn't how history unfolded. Hopefully future leaps of integration will be done less clandestinely and with voter approval, but unfortunately this issue must be solved now.

Essentially the euro becomes the deutche mark for southern europe, a hard currency which people keep their savings in.

The fundamental problem in the EU is that countries in the south are less competitive than those in the North and have no workable means of becoming more competitive other than austerity which doesn't actually work. 

Personally I still think an equally good if not better solution would be to split the euro in two, a southern euro and a northern euro because the nations within those two blocks would have much more aligned economies.

Sie geht auch von gleichen Preisen aus, ebenfalls fraglich, wenn das mit einer Konsumsteuer finanziert werden soll.

* assume about 60-90€ base fee + 0.25€ per used KWh of power
* usually a two person household will take about 2500 KWh
* this would be between 600-700€/year or 50-60€/month

water:

* about 30€ base fee + 1.50 - 2.00€/ cubic meter of water.
* average water use is 122l/Person &amp; day so 45 cubic meters/year or 10-15€/month for two persons

internet:

* assume about 25-40€/month if you go with the 16 Mbit incl. domestic phone calls
* 50-70 if you for top-speed including tv services, etc.

tv:

* you can get it for free if you use the digital antenna tv. that is if you live where you have good reception. in düsseldorf this is usually the case. if you bring a tv set, make sure it supports pal and dvb-t or you will need a converter/set-top box.
* if your landlord has put a contract with the local cable company in place (unitymedia), then connectivity should be included in your rent/utilities. all you need then is a tv that supports it or a set top box.
* if you do have to buy it on your own, 60-80€/month but including hd channels, internet and domestic calls.

phone:

* totally depends on usage.
* you can get an ""allyoucanphone"" plan (domestic) for about 60-70€/month
* most people pay around 25€/month incl. basic internet connection (200-500MB/month)
* cheap folks do prepay and stay under 15€/month

food:

* if you like to cook, 50-60€/person &amp; week will be doable. that means groceries from local supermarkets and no restaurants
* if you stick to an american lifestyle, it will be very expensive in düsseldorf. assume 15-20€ per meal/person, but that will be real food, no mcdonald's or other fast food.
* pizza goes for 6-9€ per piece (not slice)
* remember to NOT tip 20% in germany. people will think you are a rich idiot who can't adjust to local customs and you will have a hole in your wallet real soon. give 2-5% based on the service. waiters are paid sufficiently by their employers, so this is a gesture of appreciation, not more.

For your visa go to the police station on Carrer Balmes and be prepared to wait for a while. There are two types they offer and you want the long term one (the other is only for a month!)

There are plenty of telecoms companies. Contracts are quite expensive so just try to find one that offers free texts when you buy calls. PAYG Phones can be bought from supermarkets for 20-25e.

There is lots of wifi so a netbook/smartphone will make good use of that.

There are lots of pickpockets. Never fall asleep in public or take your hands out of your pockets in crowds. Wear a shoulder bag around your front and not behind you.

While you may think that everyone thinks gay marriage is alright, this is obviously not a case - it is legal in but a small fraction of the countries in the world. When you say ""If you really want to change your society to the better"", you're actually saying ""if you really want to change your society to be like ours"". You claim to be enlightened. You claim to be open minded. Then I implore you to accept the differences of other cultures and different sets of values. 

Regardless of whether homosexuality is natural, or harmless, we, as a culture, do not accept gays or gay marriage. I can speak on behalf 90% of the Serbs when I say so. Why is it that you think that your values should supersede ours? Why is it that, if you think that gay marriage is so holy and so righteous, only 10 members of the UN out of 192 total recognize it and allow it? Even the United States, the often quotes oh-so-great and oh such a big democracy mostly does not allow it. To quote yourself, you seem to disregard these facts and find pleasure in doing so. 

Does Serbia have real problems? Of course it does: but that only enforces my argument. Gay marriage should be the least of our concerns, yet it is constantly being pushed by the West. And please, next time you are to use some sources, please do not quote a US-based agency: there are no larger hypocrites on Earth than Americans.

&gt; ""Paedophiles"" (pedophiles) hurt children, ""necrophilists"" (necrophiliacs) mock others' grief - no western society allows these behaviors.

You see here, ""no western society"". I could as well say ""no eastern society allows gay marriage"". Why is there a difference between the two? And just like I asked in another question, convince me that a 15 year old girl does not know what she is doing; yet when she is with a 30 year old guy, he will be arrested for pedophilia. Not only that, but in many, many cultures in the world, girls of that age (and younger) are already married to much older men.

&gt; Hatred towards a minority is of no cultural value, in fact it's the opposite: a collective shame. It blocks social integrity, peaceful coexistence, mutual tolerance and respect.

I clearly meant that as a universal statement, applying to your own culture as well. Those that I in fact *did not* adress (e.g. ""there are no larger hypocrites on Earth than Americans"", ) are for a very good reason: I do not wish to waste my time disproving conspiracy-theories and stereotypical reasoning.

Another naivety of your's concerns those ""actual statistics"". I hope I do not need to make you understand that every news company has a political agenda and bias, moreover primitive sociological repertoire. Furthermore, allow me to remind you, that ""gay marriage"" is not the topic of our debate (nor the OP's), I'm concerned about you feeling satisfied having your government deprive a minority's constitutional right.

If this isn't self-explanatory enough let me put it this way for you: it is very self-righteous of you to think you have 90% of your society supporting your homophobia, based on a politically biased, scientifically incompetent newspaper, **that wasn't even addressing this same issue.**

This is the second time you brought this up, so I have to address it: am I open minded opposed to you? In this topic, certainly. I come from a catholic, right-wing background, have been taught to despise gays. I have examined the argument and understood that my upbringing was wrong (and yes, I am hetero, you fucktwad). You, on the other hand feel that oppression can be legitimized by the majority, because your culture demands it. Newsflash: cultures can be morally wrong.

Do I feel more enlightened? Just the way you might feel towards muslim societies, where women are treated as third class citizens, half-humans. They could make the same cultural arguments as you do, and I hope I don't have to explain the social advantages of emancipation, like I'm trying to with tolerance.

Realize the common ground for the likes of you is the same, since medieval times: [""they must be beaten like horses""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55TS_ofUtfo&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=71s). The muslim - in this matter - are like-minded.

Not really sure what you can do, though. Spain doesn't seem to care about what happens at the border with us, and the La Linea Ayuntamiento probably has no jurisdiction over that.

Any particular reason why you're living in Gibraltar and commuting into Spain? Usually it's the reverse... (Unless I misunderstood what you said)

In any case, it's downright ridiculous that we have to deal with this. The Government (and by extension, the RGP) mostly ignores the tobacco smuggling because it makes millions of pounds worth of revenue for the government (how else could you fund a fancy £50 million airport? :p) and the Guardia Civil/Spanish government are only interested in doing the bare minimum for us because well... it's Gibraltar, sovereignty issues, etc etc.

Yes, that's correct, and if you would manage to find one it's unlikely that it would pay enough to live off. Also, you'd risk deportation from the EU, which would bar you from entry in any country that asks for such things in their visa application.

Even if you *would* have a TEFL certification, you'd still have to find a language school that would sponsor your visa, which means they'd have to demonstrate that they can't find a qualified applicant from within the EU. Given Ireland's current economic situation and high youth unemployment, being a native speaker by itself won't cut it.

If you want out of the US *now*, your best bet would be to apply for a Working Holiday visa. That's bilateral and wouldn't work for Germany as a US citizen, but it would work e.g., for Australia, which is pretty nice and has a great economy these days. The application period for the 2012 contingent should begin right about now, and you could stay in Germany or the Schengen Area for three months, which means you could fly on directly from here. This would give you one year in Australia with a (limited) work permit, which should be enough time to do research and make a proper plan, e.g., to apply for a Bachelor program in English in Germany with a focus on teaching, if that's what you want to do.

It has the longest line of bars in Europe along its river, and pretty cool shops. some areas can be dear but just head over to old town and take in the atmosphere, its amazing.
