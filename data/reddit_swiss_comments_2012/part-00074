In addition, there are very attractive conditions for tourists from abroad like the [Swiss Flexi Pass](http://www.swisstravelsystem.com/en/tickets-en/swiss-flexi-pass-en.html) where you can travel for only 254 CHF for 3 days (that's not what you need, but probably they have other good offers for only 2 days). 

I'm pretty sure that this would cost you less than renting a car even if you don't have to pay the 40 CHF.

 If it is sunny out, go to hotel spinne and order a pizza in the terrace. If you come on sunday, the pizza is cheaper if you go to the bar in the hotel (espresso) and eat there. Also across the road from the spinne, there is the eiger hotel, and sundays is burger days and mondays burrito day (cheaper prices, everything is crazy expensive here) 
Are you staying at a hotel in grindelwald? We offer a guest card for our guests, which you can use the local bus free of charge, the indoor swimming pool at the sport center and have a small discount to smaller attractions in the area. 
The bars aren't so full nowadays, but I'd recommend espresso bar, nice people there and my roommate is a bartender there.
All in all I'm sure you'll find plenty of things to do, and the view is breathtaking. Oh and the hiking paths are mostly clear of snow by now, but not totally. I'd suggest going up the first cable car and hiking there for a bit. You get a very nice view of the alps!
