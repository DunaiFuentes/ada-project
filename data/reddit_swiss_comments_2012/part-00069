true,canteloupy,vd,Vaud,"Yes they are, because it's not ""chemical"".

I can honestly understand the appeal for the idea, because holistic approaches with natural ingredients where the guy sits down and asks about your innermost feelings, always sound better than ""we're going to examine you with no emotions whatsoever then give you some chemicals that we determined with no emotions whatsoever that it worked on 80% of people in the trial we ran with no emotions whatsoever and it will probably work for you"".

Medicine is misunderstood as argument from authority. Pharma companies are villified because they make money off disease, which is always tricky. Of course, Boiron makes money off people's distress just as well, but they ignore this thanks to good marketing.

The thing is, the green party is infused with the impression that corporations, helped by the political establishment, are seeking to promote unhealthy things or suppress truth about their dangerous practices. And by and large, they're right. There were bitter fights with the chemical industry about the Rhine pollution, there were and are bitter fights about cigarettes and the corporations systematically sought to repress truth, there is widespread disinformation about global warming, about pesticides, about BPA and phtalates... It's only natural that they don't take the industry's word for it when it says homeopathy is bunk or wifi is harmless.
