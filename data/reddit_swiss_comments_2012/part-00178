true,EnergyAnalyst,null,null,"I am a Franklin alumnus. My advice is that at 17, you really ought to just take things one step at a time. As many of the Swiss redditors have mentioned, you have a long time before you would qualify for Swiss naturalization. Most people who look back on their life plans they had at the age of 17, even just 4 years later, get a good laugh doing so. Not that there is anything particularly silly about what you want to do, but you will learn, mature, and change with experience and what your future self wants to do 4 years from now will probably be significantly different than what you propose in your post.

If you are absolutely steadfast about becoming a Swiss citizen, you will have to work really hard to find and cultivate job opportunities for yourself for after Franklin while you are still in school. It takes something like 8 years to become eligible for citizenship in Switzerland, as in, you need to live there (I think continuously). 4 years of university studies only gets you half way, and if you don't have a work visa for a job in the country after that, then you aren't welcome to stay there. Getting a work visa is no easy task, I've been told. Not to make a big generalization, but the Swiss authorities are not really big fans of permanent immigration.

If you do get on the path to Swiss citizenship, and you really want to earn it well and serve the country, there are other ways to provide public service and to contribute to the public good than to serve in the Military. It isn't all that likely that the Swiss military is going to be called into action much in the foreseeable future anyway.

My advice in the near term is to take it one step at a time. When you get to Lugano, find some locals that you share an obscure common interest with and try to get integrated into the local society. I say obscure common interest because if it is obscure enough, they will be happy enough to have someone new they can enjoy their hobby/etc with that they won't mind dealing with the language barrier that you'll present at first. Or you could find some French Swiss living in Lugano. Once you learn more Italian, then it will be easier to travel in wider circles in Ticino. When I was in Lugano I made some local friends because I was a downhill mountain biker and they wanted people to ride with. I also made some local friends at the local skatepark and with the Franklin Soccer team.",0,1355499083,null,0,1355499652,0,c7giacu,t3_139zaw,t1_c7giacu,t3_139zaw,null,1430672451,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
