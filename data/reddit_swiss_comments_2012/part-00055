&gt;Marcus Bachmann, the congresswoman’s husband since 1978, reportedly was eligible for Swiss citizenship due to his parents’ nationality — but only registered it with the Swiss government Feb. 15. Once the process was finalized on March 19, Michele automatically became a citizen as well, according to Honegger. Bachmann’s three youngest children are also now Swiss citizens, and her two older children are eligible to apply for a fast-track citizenship process, according to an email from the consulate provided and translated by Honegger. 

So her husband is swiss, and as they are married for a long time, she could apply for it too (prbably at the same time as him). It probably didn't work as ""automatically"" as it is described, but there might be some loopholes for people with enough money.

Switzerland is supporting crime. By your logic any other country can protect swiss rapists as long as they don't rape someone in the country they fled to.
