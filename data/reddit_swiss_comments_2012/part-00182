yes, there is a culture of responsibility, but it is completely unrelated to gun ownership. It has to do with a small, stable and prosperous society. People don't own guns to protect their homes or because they love their 'right to bear arms'. It is culturally ingrained because of the militia army, neutrality and attached traditions. Guns will only be used in a social setting for sport, practice or in the distant case of war. It's a very different premise.

true,Lorgramoth,null,null,"&gt;Although guns are responsible for between 200 and 300 suicides each year in Switzerland, Pro-Tell’s Suter says these statistics have to be put in a wider perspective. He points out that the bullets used in suicides are only a tiny fraction of the 75 million rounds of ammunition that are fired each year in Switzerland during military and civilian target practice.

true,chromopila,zh,Zürich,"The military uses pistols. And no: a rifle isn't more deadly, especially an assault rifle. An assault rifle isn't more deadly than a pistol. There are pistols that have a higher round capacity than ARs, quick shooting means also a higher wastage of bullets, which means that less people are getting killed with the same amount of ammo. The bullets used in an pistol are not more lethal than those used in assault rifles. Intermediate cartridges do have a higher energy than bullets fired from pistols, but this isn't what makes it lethal. What kills people isn't the energy that the projectile fired at them had in the beginning, but how much energy they lose on their way through the victims body.",0,1356118024,null,0,false,0,c7k8jac,t3_156wih,t1_c7k8jac,t1_c7k699e,null,1430737940,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

true,absolutkiss,null,null,"Listen, I don't know where you're getting this idea from, but plenty of people buy the AR15 expressly for the use of self-enjoyment, marksmanship, and competition. The reason why it's so popular is because it's such a great gun, and because it can be easily customized. The majority of people buying it are buying it because of these reasons, NOT because they want to kill people.

I have several friends that own these guns, for the reasons stated above. They are responsible members of society, keep their guns locked up and secure, and certainly don't want to kill anyone!

There are also plenty of people in the U.S. that have served in the military, and therefore have lots of experience with the M16, which is the military version of this gun.
