true,Gimly,fr,Fribourg,"I'll try to answer. I live in Switzerland and work in a company that employs a lot of people coming from non-EU countries, so it's definitively not something impossible.

Of course, you will need to have a permit to live here and the only way to get one is to get a job. Since you are married, I think only one of you has to have a job, so either you or your wife will have to work.

We have laws in Switzerland that gives the ""national priority"" to jobs, meaning that in order for an employer to hire a foreigner he needs to give proof that he hasn't found a Swiss that could fit his requirements. It's a bit easier for EU citizens than for non-EU, but again, it's not impossible.

Also, remember that Switzerland has 4 official languages (German, French, Italian, Romanch, by order of importance). 

The most important regions for tech-jobs (and all jobs really) that I can think of are Geneva and the Lake Leman region (Lausanne), Zurich, Basel and a bit of Bern, maybe Fribourg.

Geneva, Lausanne and Fribourg are in the french speaking region, the rest in the german speaking one. But anyway, you'll find also a lot of companies that will have 100% english work environment.

You are right, if you want to move to Switzerland you will first need to get a job and your employer will have to sponsor you for a visa.

In my case, I first got a limited ""L"" visa for two years, and then a limited ""B"" visa for a year. During this time if I leave my employer I do not have permission to live in the country, and have to leave. I'm hoping that I will get an unlimited ""B"" visa this year however. You could get lucky and straight away get a ""B"" visa, it all depends on the political situation at the time (how many B's they give out per year) and the time of year you apply (how many are left to give out). 


If you're skilled as a software dev, you should be able to find a job somewhere here I would say. If it is with a large company (most likely a bank) with a decent HR department, they will have people that specialise in the immigration side of things, there are lots of foreigners here.

With regards to why we want to move, it's complicated but basically we want to live around people with different temperaments. In the US and to a lesser extent Canada people get angry at the drop of a hat. It can be hard to have a civil intellectual discussion because of the absolutism and extremism in the culture; You can't be critical of something without people deciding you are against it.  I think this sort of extremism is reflected in the foreign and economic policies of the US and countries that follow the US' lead (such as Canada).  

I think Switzerland may be a good fit because:
* I like to do the best work I can and I very much respect the high standards to which the Swiss hold their own work.
* I am pro-gun very much in the Swiss vein.  Guns are serious but shouldn't be feared.  They're a tool.
* I want to live conservatively and to live in a country whose policies reflect that (noninterventionism, etc).
* I like German but don't necessarily want to live in Germany.
* Switzerland is beautiful.
* I like new experiences and feel like a European country is the next step for us.

As a technologist I've been running my own servers in Switzerland for almost a year now because of the guarantee to privacy in the Swiss constitution.  I abhor the way the US and its allies are eroding freedom and I just can't bring myself to continue using services in the US knowing that the government has so much leverage.
