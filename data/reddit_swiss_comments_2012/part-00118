true,[deleted],null,null,"The American IRS, at the direction of the Obama administration, has been cracking down on American citizens using foreign banks as tax shelters.  In 2009, in order to avoid the debacle that would result from trying to prosecute all the people guilty of this, the IRS set a deadline for people to disclose their offshore accounts, pay their taxes, and receive amnesty.  This is bad for Swiss banks as they are a popular choice for wealthy Americans looking to hide their income from the US government.

Meanwhile, Romney has bank accounts all over the world, including in Switzerland.  Romney has refused to reveal his tax records, which is a common thing for presidential candidates to do.  Many suspect that refusal is because Romney was likely one of the wealthy Americans who received amnesty for illegally hiding income in Swiss bank accounts, and though he would not be in legal trouble because the IRS had granted him amnesty, it would still be terrible politically for him to admit that he had broken the law in the past.

Romney also is very much against regulating the banking industry.  So it's likely that Credit Suisse believes that he will undo the strict crackdowns by the IRS that have begun under the Obama administration.  This would make it easier for wealthy Americans to continue hiding income in foreign accounts, which would be good for Credit Suisse.",0,1346645897,null,0,false,0,c62nle9,t3_z8159,t1_c62nle9,t3_z8159,null,1429803204,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

You might want to consider staying in Geneva the whole time and then using public transportation to go other places. (Some hotels also give you a discount if you stay a certain number of days). Cologny is a bus ride away, and has great views. You can easily access Mt. Blanc or Mt. Saleve.

The ""Golden Express Train"" (to Gruyeres) leaves from Geneva, and is great if you like chocolate, wine, and cheese. If you like science you can go to CERN, but [request](http://outreach.web.cern.ch/outreach/visites/individuelle.html#form) a tour ASAP. 

Also the tourist office in the airport or train station can give you great deals. Just show up, tell them where you want to go, and they'll do their best to save you some $$$.
