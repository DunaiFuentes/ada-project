true,billcube,ge,Genève,"Dodgy parts of some cities (Zürich, Geneva) can be ""unsafe"" as you will see drug dealers arguing violently about their ""point of sale"". Apart from that, any town of less than 50'000 people in Switzerland is safe as can be. The center of the country is safer, because there is less drug dealing/burglaries.

I wouldn't say it's the safest place in Europe, as Sweden and most nordic countries also have a nice and sound society. You can read the daily reports of the police of Geneva (city with the most crimes) here: http://www.ge.ch/police/communiques/ . You'll see that apart from drug dealers being arrested, there is no real concern for those who live a drug-free life.

Yup, it's pretty difficult to find something. Also studying at the UNIL, I have an even smaller budget. I finally found an apartment with 1 room (4th floor, 27m2), 2min away for 700.-/month. I'm struggling to find a nice parking spot and am renovating the whole thing for two weeks now, but it's ok. There were over 30 other applications for this apartment...

The problem with you not being Swiss is that the gérances usually want at least a Swiss guarantor. As you could experience yourself, the demand is much higher than the supply. They have no problems to find a new tenant in Lausanne, even more around the university. If the have the choice between 30 dossiers, chances are that they will find somebody with the same salary/guarantees that you have, but with a Swiss passport. Swiss nationality = less problems for them in case you cause them any problems.

Some tips: 

* if they ask, you are a very good student, don't have a boyfriend (and basically no friends at all), are allergic to pets and hate any kind of music (specially those you make yourself)

* join your curriculum vitae to your dossier (the same you would use for a job application) and an attestation de non poursuite de l'Office des poursuites even if they don't ask for it

* join as much relevant documents as you can, even if not obligatory (assurance RC / ménage, your last 3 months of salary, employment contract); just add them after the obligatory documents and mention them in your letter under ''annexes'' (because your dossier will always start with a personalized letter, followed by their form and your documents – if you need an example letter I can show you mine, just pm me)

* find a guarantor (if possible Swiss and with a good salary) and join the same documents (his assurance RC / ménage, his last 3 months of salary, attestation de non poursuite)

* visit the appartements as soon as you can and **bring** (**not send**) your dossier to the gérance shortly after (maximum one day after the visit)

* **always** (and I couldn't recommend you this more) put your papers into one of [those](https://www.google.com/search?q=duraclip&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod%3D7&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=W9tHUL6wM8TbsgbYqoDgCQ&amp;biw=1407&amp;bih=758&amp;sei=Y9tHUNSFHsjetAb46IHgCA) (back is colored, front transparent, papers can be fixed to the left); they cost around 1-2.-/piece, but are worth it (even if you exceptionally can't bring them your dossier by yourself, take one of those and choose a suited envelope)


I had lot of problems to find an apartment last year. This year I visited around 6 of them and sent in 3 dossiers. There where over 30 other demands for each of them (I once brought my dossier to the gérance the day after I visited the apartment and they already had a 40cm staple of them). I didn't get the first one, but got the second one before the third gérance had even decided.

If you need any help / advice for your dossier or the UNIL you can pm me. BTW, if you decide to go for a colocation I ''know'' two female students who search a third colocataire (4.5 pce, 764.-).
