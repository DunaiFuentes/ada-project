If you are planning to come to live here, you should at least learn one national language and have enough money to live for a year or two (count with  a minimum of 2000USD/month just to get by). Your best option would be to graduate HS, and get admitted to an [university here](http://www.unige.ch/futursetudiants/Info.html) and with that you are entitled to work part time (max. 50% or 20h/week), which should (barely) cover for your living costs. 

The problem is that when you finish your studies, you have to leave the country, unless you find employment with an employer who is willing to get through the trouble of getting you papers. I would still recommend Geneva, because it has a diverse population with a lot of english-speaking people and French is definitely easier to learn than German. The downside as I said is that you will have to leave the country once you obtained your degree and those years spent here do not count towards naturalization.

Another option would be to graduate in the US and find employment here with an NGO or an international organization (plenty of those here), that will get you papers right away and the years spent with those papers count towards naturalization (rules [here](http://www.bfm.admin.ch/content/bfm/en/home/themen/buergerrecht/einbuergerung/ordentliche_einbuergerung.html)).",0,1339408878,null,0,false,0,c4z1926,t3_uv31r,t1_c4z1926,t3_uv31r,null,1429116033,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
