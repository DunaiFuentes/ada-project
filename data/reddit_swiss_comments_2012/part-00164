Austria and the UK HAVE signed that deal (goes into effect 1.1.2013). Italy and Greece want THAT deal. So it's not so onesided as you portray it.

&gt;the mean swiss themselves evidently planned, supported and made tax evasion for the germans to singapore.

That's an argument that has made the rounds in Germany but facts don't back that assertion. 
According to the Swiss government only 1% of all the German assets in Switzerland have been moved out since September 2011. Of that 1%, 50% went to Germany, 25% to other EU nations and only 25% is outside of the EU. So if your opposition to the deal is that 0.25% might escape the deal, I'm not sure you are being very rational.

The right to privacy is something we Swiss take very seriously. Secret bank accounts were introduced to protect minorities from having their assets seized by Xenophobic governments. Something which you'll recall wasn't that rare a few decades ago.
That those bank accounts have been abused to avoid taxation is exactly what that deal is meant to fix. 
As of 2013, if an Austrian has money in a secret swiss bank account he'll be taxed at a higher rate than if he'd declare his assets to the Austrian government. Germans... well it seems they got a free pass from their government...

&gt;The Swiss people themselves can be caught by swiss authorities...while the same authorities protect criminals from other countries.

That's blatantly untrue. The Swiss government only knows about my bank account and the amount of money in it because I told them about it. The government has no way to know of it otherwise UNLESS they have proof I'm lying about my revenue or am involved in criminal activities such as being in the mafia or being a terrorist. And that system is exactly the very same as the one offered to other nations.
Any country can get ""secret"" swiss bank account information, get them frozen or get access to their content if they have proof of their involvement in criminal activites or tax fraud.

That's true, it's worse. 

Here is how it works: Any money in Germany gets taxed at a rate that is higher than the equivalent German rate.
That money is then sent in a giant invoice to Germany.

The taxed person can then, in his tax form, declare his account to the German government and get the difference between the higher Swiss tax rate and the lower German tax rate back.
This is a high incentive for people to declare their accounts.

Or, the person can decide that his privacy is worth paying for and he doesn't declare his account to the German government. In which case the German government still gets its money (more actually).

Please don't mix us up with our bankers. Bankers are bankers. They are all working hard to find a way to cheat taxation. German bankers are in no way any different.

&gt;The idea of the ""bankgeheimnis"" is just something that only, and is only good for the really rich people, or people who want to hide money. The average joe does not have any benefit at all.


In the past, there were a ton of average people with VERY good reasons to hide money. I for one like the fact that if you live in a fucked up country there is a way for you to make sure you don't get all your assets confiscated by it.
That new system in the tax deal protects that AND makes sure countries get their fair taxes.

&gt;It's also not at all an argument when you say »every« other nation wants this »deal«. Just take a look at the US and they are the perfect example of a nation which doesn't want this »deal«. Now the question is, why are the swiss so obedient when it comes to the US?

2.The money of the world is the USD, so if swiss banks wouldn't get access to fresh dollars, they had serious problems. 

The dealings with the US are something that are more akin to a mugging than a deal. The US pretty much blackmailed Switzerland into violating its own constitution and laws. 
Forgive me if I'm not jumping up and down at the prospect of making that happening regularly.

&gt;Do you really want to collect taxes for the german government? And do you really think it's a good idea to have different deals with all the governments of the world? That's gonna be quite a task. 

The idea is to make that deal a standard deal that can be quickly implemented for every nation. The other option of exchanging bank data would require exactly the same kind of deal for every nation.

&gt;And how would germany be able to control, that everybody who has his money in switzerland is appropriately taxed? Should they really trust a notoriously schizophrenic nation?

Our bankers might be scum and yes, we left them run wild waaaay too long, but I take offense at that. Our government has ALWAYS upheld its deals with other nations with utmost reliability.

Der Durchschnittsbürger bedankt sich für die gestiegenen Bodenpreise und sonst für nichts.

&gt;  Aus den Analysen lässt sich vor allem ein genereller Schluss ziehen: Zwar hat das Personenfreizügigkeitsabkommen das Wachstum verschiedener Komponenten des BIP pro Kopf mit Sicherheit beeinflusst. Diese Verschiebungen haben aber weder zu einem statistisch messbaren Strukturbruch in der durchschnittlichen Wachstumsrate des BIP pro Kopf, noch zu einer substanziellen Veränderung der (konjunkturbereinigten) strukturellen Wachstumsrate der Arbeitsproduktivität geführt. Ebenso wenig haben sie Veränderungen, welche Wirtschaftsbranchen in der Schweiz zum gesamtwirtschaftlichen Produktivitätswachstum beitragen, herbeigeführt. Damit scheint sich auch für die Personenfreizügigkeit der Befund aus internationalen Studien und aus empirischen Arbeiten zur Einführung der Personenfreizügigkeit in der Schweiz zu bestätigen: Die substanzielle Immigration aus dem EU/EFTA-Raum der letzten Jahre hat vor allem das BIP stimuliert. Die Auswirkungen auf das Wachstum des Durchschnittseinkommens – wenn mit dem BIP pro Kopf gemessen – waren wohl eher gering, und dürften auch in Zukunft nicht substanziell sein.
