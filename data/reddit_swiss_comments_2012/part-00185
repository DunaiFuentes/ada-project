Yes, as long as you're not a dick.

true,D49A1D852468799CAC08,zh,Zürich,"&gt;Is it safe to walk at night? 

Yes.

&gt;How are Americans typically received?

The same as other foreigners. Politely but distantly. Don't be a dick. Police typically only stop and search people if they are dark skinned or look like drug addicts. 

&gt;Anything to not do or say when talking to someone, or ordering from a restaurant?

Swiss people are typically extremely private, and while they will be polite, it would be unusual to share personal information with a person you have just met. 

&gt;Is the 72 hour pass for transportation and museums a must for someone that will want to travel and tour the city?

It depends where you are staying really. If you need to use public transport to get to the city, then definitely. 

&gt;Any bars or night clubs I should check out?

There are a lot of clubs. Take your pick. Try www.tilllate.ch or www.usgang.ch for more info.

&gt;Any other miscellaneous information I should know?

I'm not sure how long you will be here for, but you can probably see everything in Zürich in one day. For a good view of the city (if the weather is clear) go up the Üetliberg (take the S1 from HB). If you're here for a few days you might want to check out other cities like Luzern, or go hiking some place close by. Or skiing, if that's what floats your boat.

true,Tszar,be,Bern,"Hey there, glad you found your way in here! At first, I think my swiss friends here are generally a bit rude to you, so I'll take a shot at answering your questions too, but im from Berne - I visit Zürich often on weekends, but I don't live there.

1) Zürich is mostly safe to walk at night. If you're traveling alone I would nonethenless avoid going to the Shilquai where the street prostitutes are or the ""Langstrasse"" - it's a famous clubbing ""mile"", where things CAN get nasty. They won't, and you totally don't have to be afraid to be robbed or worse, but those are just two places where you could find the wrong people if you're looking for them. But overall, don't be afraid to go out alone. Everything's pretty safe.

2) Americans don't have a special reputation, so you'll be welcomed like everybody else, as long as you're not the heaviest republican and advertise that like there's no tomorrow, you'll be fine. Zürich is pretty liberal.

3) Not really. Just don't talk about swiss clichés like esec_666 said.
Older swiss people are indeed a little bit stubborn and very formal, but the the younger generation (under 30) are not so obsessed by formalities. You can talk about personal stuff if you want to. Most of the time it will be totally okay. Personally I find it very interesting to talk with foreigners, but some swiss people have the tendency to be really shy and they often don't make the first step.
What you really should do is say ""thanks"" and ""please"" everytime you ask for something or recieve something. This is really important. Do it in bars, at the ticket office, when asking for directions, anytime! It's very rude if you'll forget it - in Zurich a little bit less because they're always (pretending) to be in a hurry and have to worlds most important thing ahead, but if you don't do it as a foreigner it will be interpreted as a rude gesture.

4) absolutely. the public transportation is absolutely worth every penny and you'll get TONS of connections to almost everywhere. If you're planning on visiting different cities I'd recommend the ""swiss pass"". It will allow you to use public transportation for almost every public transportation system across the whole country. And as mentioned here before, Zurich is pretty small. For an american it would almost be considered a village with ""only"" about 200'000 residents. the main city is much much smaller. 

5) Zürich is the swiss hot spot for good clubbing. You'll find something, it depends on your taste. Ask at your hotel if there are young receptionists, or just some young people on the street. They will gladly talk to you about their favourite club. But generally don't go to the ""OXA"". Everything else will be fine. My favourites are the ""Blokk"" or ""The Hive"". Just PM me with your preferences, and I try to recommend you some clubs.

Additional information:
Berne is the capital city, not zurich, alltough Zurich is bigger. There are a lot of cool cities withing an hour traveling distance from Zurich, like Lucerne, Basel or Berne, the countryside is beautiful and if you're here don't miss out on visiting at least one mountain!
