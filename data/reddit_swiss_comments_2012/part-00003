true,[deleted],null,null,"This is correct. I just wanna add four things: 

1) Unemployment benefits in Switzerland aren't paid by a generous government, they are paid by YOU! As soon as you work and you get money you have to pay an unemployment insurance fee (1.1%, your boss has to pay the same amount for you too). After you have pay this fee for 12 months, you are obliged to get the unemployment benefits.

2) Since this is ""just"" an insurance, there is no racial motivation to give (or not to give) you the money. When you apply for it, you most probably have to fill in a form your nationality (it's bureaucracy), but that's it. You definitely don't have to state a race or a religion or something like it. So a Roma will get the same money as any Slovak or any foreigner or any Swiss.

3) If you quit your job by yourself or if you loose it because you really screw up (come to work always drunk, are VERY lazy) and this is written in your job reference then the agency has the right to ""punish"" you by denying some of your money (you probably have to wait for a month or two until you finally get some money). This also happens when you don't really look for a job.

4) Of course this only applies if you have a proper job (contract et al). If you do illicit work or are illegally in the country, you will not be able to get unemployment benefits (since it's an insurance).

You, none really, at least from this excerpt. I left most of the racist stuff out, as it was unimportant to my original question. The aim is to actually show that the Swiss have a better social system than us and can handle inadaptable people better.

But to explain more and give you some context - in Slovakia, there is a very large Roma minority, of over 400 000 I think. Over half of them are your usual nice hardworking people, but about 40% aren't. They live in atrocious conditions, steal, drink, mug, fight and live only off welfare / unemployment benefits. Sadly, the social / welfare system does a poor job of preventing fraud, so many people, not only Roma, take advantage. This of course is the cause of many racial tensions, especially in regions where the Roma are the majority. Many people outright hate the Roma, many of those people even don't distinguish between the good and bad ones. There is even a young nationalist (read: neonazi, although they do a good job of hiding that) party that based it's program on the people's hate of the Roma. There are also many public organizations that aim to help the inadapted Roma, however many are either just out for eurofunds or are too politically correct and uptight to actually be able to do anything.

So, as one of the results, there are now two hoaxes running around the internet in Slovakia. One states that a family of 6 Roma gets about 680E in benefits, while a nurse with 2 children gets paid about 560E a month. This is a lie, the sad part being that it's too close to the truth to be comfortable. But it's been disproven(not that many people believe the truth). The second is this one, which presents us with kind of an utopistic social system where the Roma have to work much harder for their benefits than in Slovakia. And it's also largely presented as the truth, written in a way that implies that only the Roma need to work his hard in Switzerland, asks why no one screams at the Swiss for racism because of this system and so on. I have not seen this hoax disproven yet, so I decided to dig around a bit and find out how things really are.

The sad part here is, even though I present people with the evidence of these two hoaxes being hoaxes, some just decide to ignore it and continue ranting about all the bad Roma and whatnot and actually get angry at me for breaking their perfect worldview:)

Whew.. This came out longer than I expected.. But I hope I explained it well:) anyway:

TL;DR: There are many bad Roma in Slovakia, an imperfect social/welfare system and many latent racists, which is the cause for much desinformation. The Swiss are actually presented as a positive example in this case. ",0,1326236922,null,0,false,0,c3fwryj,t3_o9ldd,t1_c3fwryj,t1_c3fsuwb,null,1428157851,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
true,zupatol,ge,Genève,"Thanks for this explanation.

The law in Switzerland is definitely the same for everyone once you get to work there. Then there are laws about who can come or not, so slovakian romas would have the same rights as any other EU citizens.

Here in Geneva there are rom beggars. In 2010 there were also begging children which the state tried to put in schools, but it seems it didn't have much success, the children just disappeared.

I just found this on Slovakia's wikipedia page:

The U.S. State Department in 2010 reported:
    ""The government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however, there were problems in some areas. Notable human rights problems included some continuing reports of police mistreatment of Romani suspects and lengthy pretrial detention [...] and societal discrimination and violence against Roma and other minorities.""

It seems the few Romas we have here are treated better than in Slovakia.
