My intention with bringing this to Reddit (and Restorang if accepted) was to shine a more negative light on W&amp;B. Looks like I'm preaching to the choir in your case!",0,1349501220,null,0,false,0,c6idnb4,t3_10zejz,t1_c6idnb4,t1_c6i8yp8,null,1430077043,0,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,0

Living In Graubünden (even if not in the German speaking part), I was able to understand the Bündner, but not the rest. 
Even the first personal pronoun isn't the same for everybody: some say ""i"", some other ""isch"" (like in the south of Germany).
It's, however, true that the biggest difficulty is not in the written communication, but in the oral one: intonation and pronunciation are, in fact, quite different from German and between different Swiss German languages.

I have taken the course, and it was....good. I don't rave about it because I did not like my teacher very well, but I met other teachers that were really great, and the success of fellow students I met seemed to be quite good. 

Your learning will depend on you, but taking a class for 440chf (cheap for Switzerland in fact) will certainly get you motivated to learn! One of the biggest benefits for me was to just get me speaking and hearing German, it is so easy to not start, and this got me in the mode.
