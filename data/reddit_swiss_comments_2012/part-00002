http://www.pickwicks.ch/baden/

I've never been there personally, but I've heard a lot of good things about it. There's also one in Zurich where I'm a regular ;) 

In Zurich you have, of course, a lot of other great pubs and bars. Like Nelsons, Lady Hamillton, O'Reillys, Big Ben Pubs, or Outback. just google them to find their location. :)

If you're more into clubs than bars, there's a lot of different stuff going on from cheap (Clubs at Langstrasse) to very expensive (like Mascotte/Kaufleuten).
 It really depends on what kind of music you prefer so just check out [usgang.ch](usgang.ch) for ideas.

ask away if you have any more questions about going out in Zurich and surroundings! Enjoy your time here! ",0,1325878108,null,0,false,0,c3el28a,t3_o5gj0,t1_c3el28a,t3_o5gj0,null,1428134879,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

As for places to visit: I loved Interlaken. lots to do if you are into adventure sports (canyoning is awesome), it's also stunning. 

Zermatt is also very beautiful but I only went in the summer for a hike. I hear it can get pricey for skiing. the train ride in will blow you away.

true,meeeow,null,null,"My compilation of advice:

- What the fuck are you doing shopping at Manor on a budget? Do you want to check out Globus as well? O_o For grocery I'd go to Migros because their own brand stuff (The green ones) are pretty darn good and fairly priced. Co-op is ok, I just prefer Migros personally.

- Denner is Migro's sister store, the one that sells booze and fags. They are pretty much next to each other 90% of the time, it's cheaper than Migros but always quite messy and often don't have everything you need but could save you a good buck to go there before you go to CO-OP or Migros. Look out for ""Aktion"" (discounted items / deals).

- Having said this, convenience food sucks at Migros, if you want a sammich or lunch a COOP is better. If you can, go near closing times or saturday nights (when they don't open on sundays) to get this kind of food at 50% off

- There's no budget nights out in Switzerland I'm afraid. I'm not in German side so I only know festivals... I'd look out for [http://www.zurichcarneval.ch/](http://www.zurichcarneval.ch/), [Binz](http://binzbleibtbinz.ch/) is a cool place in Zurich as well, I'd go for sure if you can and [m4m](http://www.m4music.ch/) wasn't bad when I went.

- Get a half fare rail card. Why? I'll explain as I go, but if nothing else it's a great deal. If you're under 25 I'd get a V7 card to go with it (90CHF, free travel between 7pm and the last train). If nothing else GET THE HALF FARE CARD IT PAYS FOR ITSELF IN A WEEK. DO IT. NOW

- You're asking for things to do and that's why you need a half fare card. Switzerland is an awesome place to travel in but fucking expensive, so save where you can. In the German side, Interlaken is a pretty cool place to go with a lot to do. If nothing else, it's worth visiting Bern, Luzern, Locarno, Ticino, etc. I'd ignore Geneva, pretty fucking boring place. Lausanne is good for nights out, but all the good stuff in the French speaking part is during the summer. Although Sion is quite cute. 

- Keep an eye on [RailAway](http://www.railaway.ch/english/welcome-to-railaway/) offers. They give discount combo prices for train + tickets, trips, etc. Normally these change monthly. For example, me and  my bf got the combined train + entry to Bern's Paul Klee Centrum. We also have visited water part and got some amazing deals in Interlaken through the website. Keep an eye out! 

- Go up some mountains while the snow is good. It's breath taking just for the views, and quite fun with all the snow. Restaurants at these places are over-priced but I'll say that having a traditional fondue, at the top of a Swiss Mountain is a quite awesome, ""must"" experience.

- Speaking of which, you absolutely must try the following: cenovis, aromat, parfait, cheese fondue (ALWAYS have wine with cheese fondue), cervelats and if you're near Zurich, luxemburgerli from Springli.

- You mentioned skiing, atm CFF has some [ski passes](http://www.sbb.ch/en/leisure-holidays/day-trips/top-price-offers.html) on offers. I don't ski though, so my advice here is a bit limited :/

- One thing. Last week it was the Day of Three Kings. Go to Manor (yes just this once) and buy the bread that looks like a little like [this](http://a34.idata.over-blog.com/1/09/02/98/CASIER-IMPRIMEUR/GATEAU-3-ROIS-ESPAGNE.JPG) and have it with your friends. Whoever finds the prize is the king and gets to wear the crown! HOORAY! I suggest being either drunk or stoned for added comic effect.

Hope this helped at least a bit :)
