true,themuleskinner,ge,Genève,"In addition, Maurer OK'd the purchase of the Swedish Saab Gripen and refused a ""tentative"" deal to purchase the Rafale fighter jets made by Dassault of France. This was embarrassing to then French president Sarkozy who was trying to get re-elected.  There were also questions over the Swiss government's process for selecting the Gripen.  The Swiss are pretty non-transparent when it comes to making decisions and this was no exception. Also, Switzerland had initially wanted the planes delivered by 2016, but agreed earlier this year to wait until 2018, so that it could co-ordinate its order with Sweden, which also wants to buy new fighter jets from Saab.

true,kitsune,null,null,"In essence, the air force currently operates two types of jets, the F/A-18 Hornet and Tiger F-5 II. The air force wants to replace the Tigers with a new fighter jet.

Now, Switzerland and fighter jets have a complicated history.

Here is some background information:

In fact, the acquisition of the Dassault Mirage in the 60's led to massive cost overruns, the parliament's first fact-finding commission in its history, and ultimately the resignation of a federal council member.

In the 90's the government wanted to replace the Hunter with the F/A-18 Hornet. The GSOA (Group for a Switzerland without an Army) launched an initiative and managed to gather over 500'000 signatures (a record to this day) within 32 days. The initiative was hotly debated. In the end it was defeated, but over 42% of the Swiss electorate were against the new fighter jets.

As it turned out, the F/A-18 Hornet not only replaced the Hunter, but also the Mirage. A fact which was only made public after the vote. In fact the government lied about a lot of stuff during the public debate, it was a disgrace.

A large part of the population is against new fighter jets. In fact a large part of the population is against the mandatory army service. It might not be a majority, but it's a vocal minority. There are a lot of parliament members on the left who flat out refuse to vote for the acquisition new fighter jets.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Thank you for this background. Just in the past few days the Swedish government have presented their vision for the Swedish air force. Sweden will buy 40-60 planes, but the fact that Switzerland presumably buys 22 planes is part of the plan. How that turns out of course we can not know. But there is quite some criticism in Sweden as well, it is questioned especially if the need for such an expensive upgrade of the airforce is mandated when other parts of the defense is struggling. But in Sweden, Gripen is large industrial project that creates a lot of qualified jobs. So the argument is different here of course.

From my perspective, Switzerland seems like a very good partner for this kind of project. I don't know what (if any) aerospace industry you have but adding Swiss R&amp;D to the mix I assume could improve the plane, and be of benefit to Switzerland as well.",0,1346183364,null,0,false,0,c603pkd,t3_ylg4z,t1_c603pkd,t1_c600g6o,null,1429759102,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
