This law only states that while until now anybody could grow non-thc hemp, you now have to declare if you have more than four plants. This to facilitate the control of hemp culture to catch the thc-rich one.

tl;dr: This law did not change the legality of growing thc-rich hemp, only adds more constraints for growing non-thc hemp.

Edit: In fact, this law says nothing about the thc content of the hemp. It just states that if you grow more than four plants of hemp, you have to declare it. But all regulations about drugs still apply. So, as far as I understand, you can grow thc-rich hemp (with the four plants limit or declaring it), as long as you are not consuming it.
