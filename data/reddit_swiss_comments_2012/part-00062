true,[deleted],null,null,"Define ""smaller to midsize city""! Spiez and Brienz are both nice and pretty and worth a visit. But they are more like villages. If you want to go for something bigger: Try Montreux or Lucerne. These are ""real"" cities with sightseeing opportunities, museums and stuff but are very close to the mountains (e.g. you can take a ride from Lucerne to Mount Pilatus). Both cities are also next to lakes, so take a boat trip! You could stay in one of these places and still do the Golden Pass in one day.
If you have time, consider staying at both cities. Montreux is in the French speaking part, Lucerne in the German speaking part of Switzerland.

We will actually be spending the day before we get on the Golden Pass train in Montreux. So, I think a day in a small village like Spiez and Brienz would be nice.

I have heard many nice things about Lucerne.

Perhaps I will do a day in Montreux, a day in Spiez or Brienz and a day in Lucerne.

I am not a huge fan of shifting hotels every night but it sounds like it might be worth it. Maybe Spiez and Brienz are only worth a single day of visiting and our time is better spent in Montreaux and Lucerne?",0,1338000481,null,0,false,0,c4sh3em,t3_u3rqi,t1_c4sh3em,t1_c4see0t,null,1429002288,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

Sure most guys have a rifle from military service but they are usually locked in the basement until the next service.
