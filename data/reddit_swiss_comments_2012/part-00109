I know a lot of people if you need any help, though. Sadly, Lausanne has become a dangerous place at night, especially for a young woman like yourself. The same is applicable to Geneva. If you go out, I suggest you stay with a group of friends you trust, and make sure there are some guys with you. A guy got stabbed because of a lighter a couple days ago. During the day, Lausanne is pretty awesome and a really nice place. Ouchy is very nice to be next to the lake. Nice food places include Chez Xu (low key, authentic, cheap and delicious chinese) and Holy Cow (burgers). 

If you like travelling and want to discover our country, do yourself a favour and invest in a GA travelcard which will allow you to ride nearly every transport companies in the country, for no extra cost. Do all the [big cities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Switzerland) and learn about our culture. If you get tired of Switzerland, get a Eurorail pass and travel Europe by train. 

Here are a couple things you need to know about the Vaudois:

* We hate the French
* Geneva is a French Department and therefore frowned upon
* Be sure you know what are ""bourbines"" and the ""Röstigraben"". In particular, learn how to identify bourbines so as to avoid them.
* Water makes you rust which is why we only drink wine (white is preferred). c.f. Lavaux, La Cote, etc. the big wine areas
* Papet Vaudois is the best dish on the planet.
* [This](http://www.topio.ch/dico.php#P) is your new dictionary
