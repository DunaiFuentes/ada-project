true,WaterClosetMaster,null,null,"Hey I think the compulsory army is a good thing especially when you consider the difficult political situation of switzerland. Being geographically located very near to a lot of dangerous countries (Iraq, Pakistan, India, France) there will sure be a time when they will need a bunch of young and motivated soldiers to get to the battlefield in order to protect their country. Imagine what could happen if the army was not compulsory. It is very simple, let me show why you with a quick logical demonstration: 1) if there's no army, the young people will all study in the watchmaking industry 2) If they all work there, Switzerland will produce a lot more of clocks (and eventually chocolate) 3) If the production rate is so high the other countries will become jealous and try to steal their money 4) they will thus declare war to Switzerland 5) But there are no soldiers to protect the countries since they are all working on their clocks (and on their new chocolate recipes). See? That is why I think that the compulsory army is really really important. Cheers!",0,1339683388,null,0,false,0,c50hyk2,t3_uw63a,t1_c50hyk2,t3_uw63a,null,1429141425,4,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,4

* You may have read this already in other threads on /r/Switzerland, but I would advise you not to learn Swiss-German, especially since you don't speak any German yet, because it's hard to learn and everyone who speaks Swiss-German also speaks German fluently and (should) know some French and because people in the Francophone part learn Standart German.
* I'm not certain about this, but as far as I know people in Biel just talk in the language they know, assuming that the other one knows the other language.
