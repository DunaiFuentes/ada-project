From an English forum, the law is paraphrased here:

*""Third state nationals may only be admitted if a person can not be recruited from the labour market of Switzerland or another EU/EFTA member state. Swiss citizens, as well as all citizens from those countries with which Switzerland has concluded the Free Movement of Persons Agreement (at present, the EU and EFTA states) are given priority...""*

It is very hard to find a job in this segment. A friend of mine was top of his class at a Swiss university, yet struggled for a long time (he ended up doing some internships and has just recently found a real job). He too said that a lot of his classmates had jobs lined up through personal connections.

Yes I know. There have been talks about changing that in Switzerland. To be fair, there are both pros and cons. Think of a position as, say, receptionist. Providing a headshot and age does make sense here because the reality is that a lot of companies know exactly what kind of person they want to be the first face that visitors see. On the other hand of course, providing these pieces of information can lead to hiring decisions based on prejudice in fields where looks or age should not matter at all.
