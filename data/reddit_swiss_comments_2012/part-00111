Without the Tigers, IIRC, our ability to police our airspace would go even lower.

Problem is that modern jets spend more times in maintenance than in the air so 30 or so F-18s simply doesn't allow you to provide any kind of sustained air police action.

IMHO the debate shouldn't be framed as ""cool toy or not cool toy"" but how much air policing we as a nation want?

The Tigers were supposed to be phased out years and years ago anyway, I don't find it encouraging to see a 50+ year old design (some of the F-5Es are over 30 years old) being used as a justification to buying yet something new and overpriced.

The issue's not so much ""do we need new fighters"" - you're framing the debate wrong.  We need a reasonable air defense capability, neutrality or not.  Switzerland should have maneuverable, reliable, fast, short-range interceptors.  The problem is that VBS has squandered much of its credibility in the past years with its insistence on luxuries like F/A-18 (as opposed to less expensive, proven solutions like the F-16), transport aircraft, or Atalanta participation (to be fair, a lot of that was the Bundesrat being stupid).  It's just not necessary.

I don't even know whatever happened with the whole Nyffenegger affair and the suspicions of corruption when the F/A-18 were purchased.

Add to this the fact that as late as February, Swiss pilots hadn't had the chance to even evaluate the newer model Gripens, as well as the leaked reports that the F/A-18 beat the Gripen performance-wise earlier this year, and it's understandable why people think the whole process is ridiculous.",0,1345636914,null,0,false,0,c5wza0g,t3_ylg4z,t1_c5wza0g,t1_c5wynj9,null,1429704990,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3

My understanding was that the Swiss airforce has a two fighter strategy, one would be the big bad kid on the block but in smaller numbers (Mirage now F18) and the other would be smaller and cheaper (F5 now Gripen).

As such it somewhat makes sense that the newer Gripen doesn't really need to outperform the F18s.

Now wether we need that or ought to just change to one small and cheap air-police plane is something we might want to look into.

There's nothing wrong with a two-fighter strategy.  I maintain that in the face of a determined enemy, the Swiss air force would collapse like a folding chair.  But assuming a deterrent role (remember that Swiss aerial doctrine is still mostly based around a 1966 study) that functions somewhat, it would make sense.

However, the Gripen is still a tremendously expensive investment, especially compared to something like the F-16 (I know I keep mentioning that, but at less than half the price, integration with most of NATO, and greater role flexibility, I am shocked that it was not included in the competition).

true,Vlip,be,Bern,"The Swiss army is NOT a wartime army. It hasn't been for decades now.

A real wartime army (and by that I mean a credible army capable of holding its own in a real war over a long period of time) would be massively more expensive than what we pay right now (and a cost that even ""big"" nations like France, the UK and Germany find themselves unable to bear anymore either).

The Swiss army is a training army, or if you prefer a ""know-how"" maintainer. It's main purpose is maintain military know-how alive so that if we need a real army 10, 20, 50, 100 years down the line we can scale it back up relatively quick (in a few years instead of a few decades). The other possibility would be to just dissolve the army and the day we need it find ourselves like those Lybian rebels, clueless. 
(I'm not inventing anything here, just look at the public military strategy you'll see that ""real war"" requires a ramping up period measured in years and immediate engagements are limited to a few thousand soldiers over a very short period of time)

The airforce is somewhat of an exception in the sense that it does real live engagements (air policing) in addition to that know-how maintaining.

So it is a bit unfair to expect the Swiss army and airforce to be a full fledged wartime army while giving it only enough money to barely maintain know-how.

Now, as for the F16, IIRC the idea is that in the two plane strategy both planes can't come from the same country to avoid having all your eggs in a single basket. Pretty much all our F-18s found themselves grounded due to a lack of spare parts during the last Gulf War and I suppose this event made sure that no american company could bid on this fighter procurement.

I guess we could shave a bit more money out of the defence budget if we'd switch to a single small cheap fighter strategy.

Kind of moot in the face of the current F-5 / F/A-18 setup, though.

I can understand this as a concept - but if you'll recall, the Tigers were license-built, including spare parts.  RUAG is well capable of supplying spares, even if a local contractor could not.  Remember that Switzerland is one of the world's most advanced suppliers of precision machinery and electronics - including components for avionics.  The country has a long tradition of license-building military aircraft as well.

In any case, I was not aware of the two-plane strategy, although I understand the reasoning behind it.  Nonetheless, it is a luxury - a single-model strategy would do the job just as well.

Furthermore, it was my understanding that the spare part thing was either a fabrication stemming from EADS, or a canard from ""Facts"" in 2001 - based on the regularly scheduled maintenance of a significant portion of the C/D models in use by Switzerland, which just happened to be badly planned so it fell in the same time period.
