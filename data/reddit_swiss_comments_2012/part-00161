true,Koss65,ag,Aargau,"I am not a consultant, just a student doing 1 year of work experience in Switzerland.  

I was also slightly wrong above

Getting the visa was hassle and a mix between working with ABB, IASTE Canada, and IASTE Switzerland. I followed these steps

* After accepting the job, my supervisor sent me a list of documents which I filled out and sent back to him through email, which he forwarded to human resources

* 2 weeks later I received my employment contract

* 2 weeks later I didn't hear anything regarding my visa, and instead of emailing them I started the process with IASTE Canada I then informed them I started the process, and they sent me back an email saying

&gt;We have initiated  already the visa and work permit process through IAESTE
Switzerland.
Therefore, please cancel your process with IAESTE Canada.

I sent IASTE Canada an email saying

&gt; I recently discovered that ABB will be working through IAESTE Switzerland to obtain my visa and work permits, however I have already sent my application through IAESTE Canada and it will be arriving in the mail in a few days.  Therefore I am wondering if there is any way that I would be able to cancel my application, and have my application and bank draft sent back to me?

To which they replied

&gt; That is the correct process. The Canadian student registers with IAESTE in their country and the same goes for the employer abroad. Both parties must register in order to begin the process. Once I receive your documentation, I will confirm with IAESTE Switzerland that the company has registered in Switzerland. So, in short this is the proper process.

So I was given conflicting information, at that point I just sent all my documents and questions to both of them at once so they knew what was going on.

* Next I received N5 papers from IASTE Canada, filled them in, and sent it to both of them.

IASTE switzerland then said it would take about 8 weeks to process

* 6 weeks later I was leaving for China in a month and my passport was going to be held up getting my China visa, so I asked if there was anything I could do to speed up the process

IASTE switzerland checked how far along it was with the authorities, and agreed I should pick it up in China. 

I then sent an email to the consulate, and they said to contact them once I knew the visa had been shipped off.

I then got another email from IASTE switzerland saying they needed my signed employment contract and a signed AHV form, after I sent those out they sent me back an authorization form and told me my visa had been sent out

One month later while I was in China I went to the consulate with
 
* 1 Visa application form, (Type D), long term, filled in
* 1 Passport
* 2 Passport photographs
* 1 Copy of your passport data page
* 1 Copy of the authorization letter from the responsible Migration Office in Switzerland
* 1 x 505 CNY Visa fees

It only took about 4 hours to get my visa after stepping in the door.

I probably missed a few steps as well and purposefully left out a few email as this is long enough as it is and took me an hour of looking through my emails

I don't think I went in on the VWP, I just flew directly from China to Switzerland, and upon arriving in Switzerland they looked at my visa and employment contract and let me in

Let me know if you want to know anything else.
