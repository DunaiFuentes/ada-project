Being an ass all the time and just have a benefit for oneself? That is the swiss style to me.

If switzerland would be able to exist as a self-contained nation, then why did they join Schengen?

In 1985 there were not too few swiss against it. But let's see what happens when Schengen ends/dies and just the monetary union surivives...that'll be fun seeing switzerland all of a sudden being totally a fan of helping neighbors like greece just to keep their system of worldwide tax fraud alive. What else would switzerland live on? No Schengen = less if any tourists, less if any doctors and nurses etc. 
You plan on selling a lot of cheese and writswatches,right?
No, seriously...what do you think will Switzerlands image in the EU be after Schengen? Or you think Schengen will last forever?

This is McDonalds ""CAUTION: HOT"" on the coffee bullshit.

PEOPLE WHO EVADE TAXES DESTROY ECONOMIES. Not the Swiss. In fact, in Switzerland most people pay taxes without resistance because they know its the right thing to do. They don't need to be forced into it.

If you're referring to the situation with the US (the article you quoted) maybe the US should prevent tax evasion themselves?? Why do they let the money leave their shores without the taxes being paid? 

You have a classic case of ""Its someone else's fault-itis.""
