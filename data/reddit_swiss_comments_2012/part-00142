There is something in Switzerland we call the ""Röstigrabe"", it's the ""frontier"" between the german and the french speaking parts of Switzerland. Romands (french speakers) are considered not as hardworking and more easy-going than swiss germans (at least on the german side of the Röstigraben), I'm not entirely sure how they percieve us. There's always some language warfare going on in the military, people say that the Röstigraben is nowhere as deep as it is in the army. 
This is the most notable difference in Switzerland (apparenty most of the time we have a national vote, it's mostly romandie + Basel vs the rest), not sure about the Tessin (our Italian speaking Canton) and Rumantsch speakers are bilinguals (German). 

I don't know how similar or different we are to our neighbouring countires, especially since even within german speaking Switzerland there are a lot of differences (Countryside &lt;-&gt; City, Alps &lt;-&gt; lower areas, Central Switzerland &lt;-&gt; Bordering Cantons etc etc) but from what I've gathered everyone hates their counterpart (Swiss Germans dislike Germany, Romands dislike France and the Ticinesi outright hate Italy).

I have no idea about the Voralberger. I don't mean to insult you, but I don't think Swiss people care much about Austria. 

I've been told that ""Swiss French"" (that's not really a word) and French are fairly similar. Some words are different (like which meal is which, ""Ouais"" or nonante vs. quatre-vingt-dix) but the pronounciation is mostly similar. The Swiss Italians (not really a word either) have a strong accent. Again, this is second hand info, my Italian is limited to ordering Beer, Pizza and Ice Cream.

Never meant it like that, I was just curious about the relation between character traits (stereotypes) and languages. But most of the people in this thread agree that being Swiss stands above the language group, so the question is mostly answered.

I asked some Dutch speaking Belgians (I'm learning Dutch and I'm constantly searching for language partners) the same thing in regards to their French part, the answers weren't as positive and ""we are one"" like here.

If you're happy to travel further then Interlaken is great. I absolutely love Zermatt but that would be a really long day. Ski lifts are open for hiking or just getting a great view.

Finally, if you don't mind crossing the border to France, you can get a lift up to Aiguille du Midi on the Mont Blanc massif at around 3,800m and be on the top of Europe. I guess its also around 1hr from GVA and Chamonix itself is a really nice ski town.

true,zionegg,be,"Ex-La Neuveville, Berne, current Lausannois","&gt;Some if the differences do stand out though - huitante instead of quatre-vingt for ""eighty"" is the first one most people notice.

Not all Romands say huitante. Where I grew up, near Bienne/Neuchâtel, we say quatre-vingt but we also say septante, nonnante. Makes no sense I know but other Romands know straight away where we come from. Again, from my part of Swizerland, our slang contains (swiss)german words: steckrr, schleckrr, stangrr, spatz, etc but that's not surprising as we're close to or even on the linguistic border.

Living now in Lausanne, the basic romand resents the Swiss German part of our country, the ""bourbines"" as they call them. They see them as humourless and pretty anal and don't like the fact they seem to systematically vote the other way in elections (the Röstigraben as someone else pointed out), meaning they have the last say. But I think it's mostly cos they've never crossed the Sarine ;) I went to a bilingual school and very much enjoyed arsing about with my Swiss German mates and really didn't notice much of a cultural divide at all. Even if my mates liked the saying ""touchur rigole, chamais travail"" (always laughing, never working) about us ""welsch"", and to be honest, it wasn't entirely untrue... I've always like the Swiss Germans, always found them to be open and easy going, unlike the usual stereotype.

But having said that, the Romands dislike the French too mostly. The frontaliers ""steal"" their jobs, they're loud and annoying. But culturally, I'd say the majority of Romands enjoy French TV and films (frankly, TSR is pretty dire. Not saying TF1 is any better, but it's more ""polished"" and shiny.)",0,1350380366,null,0,1350380998,0,c6n76f6,t3_11iayh,t1_c6n76f6,t1_c6mpvf5,null,1430160673,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
