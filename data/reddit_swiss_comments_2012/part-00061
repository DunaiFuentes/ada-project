true,istealreceipts,null,null,"Most of my US-citizen friends have only been able to open basic accounts with Post Finance. 

They had similar stories of being turned away by UBS, Credit Suisse and cantonal banks, just because they are US citizens.

Also, you don't have to close your account when you leave Switzerland. Most banks will allow you to keep the account open, provided that you agree to pay higher account maintenance fees.

On another note: As a US citizen, if you have a diplomatic permit called a 'carte de legitimation' (you'd have to be working with the UN or an NGO), you may be allowed to open a bank account with UBS. This is because UBS has a partnership with the UN and NGOs.

It's all very convoluted and I wouldn't be surprised if some government agencies here in the United States start fighting that soon enough. They seem to be fighting everything else.
