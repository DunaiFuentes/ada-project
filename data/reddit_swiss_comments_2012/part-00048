true,[deleted],null,null,"I suggest visiting [Lake Konstanz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Constance). It's on the border between Germany and Switzerland, and the scenery is very pretty! There are boat rides and stuff like that out to some isle in the middle of the lake (and plenty of other stuff to do). The city of Konstanz is nice too from what I hear, although I haven't been there yet. 

For the ATM thing: I brought over my bank card when I moved here as I have a savings/checking account with a smallish credit union in California. I had to have my bank authorize my card for international withdrawals, but I haven't been able to get it to actually work at an ATM here. But it could just be my card or my bank or something. However we do have a Bank of America card that we are able to use here and have had no problems with that. There is a fee though for using it (I think it's 12 bucks or something each time we use it) so keep that in mind. 

If you enjoy hiking and outdoor type of stuff there are of course lots and lots of places for that. A couple of years ago my hubby and his family and I went to a place called [Lenk](http://www.myswitzerland.com/en/destinations/holiday-destinations-in-switzerland/lenk-in-the-simmental.html) and it was absolutely amazingly beautiful. They have gondola lifts going up and down various areas of the mountains, waterfalls, plenty of hiking trails (with various degrees of ease/difficulty), restaurants, shopping, etc. So far it has been my favorite place I've been to here. 

The nice thing about Switzerland is that it's so small it makes it easy to travel around and to different countries as well. The train system is excellent so I would imagine you shouldn't have much trouble getting to different places. 

As far as hotels go I'm not sure about that. My dad spent a night in a hotel near the Zurich airport that was decent (one of the big name chains but I can't remember which one) and not terribly expensive, so perhaps you might have luck if you stick around the major cities? Not sure. But being as it's going to be summer and a lot of people are going to be traveling you might want to make reservations beforehand just in case. 

Eating out here can be really expensive. I would try to stick to small cafes and things like that if you want to save money on food. You can also go into the grocery stores and buy premade sandwiches and that sort of thing. My hubby and I went to eat at a restaurant that would basically be like the equivalent of say a Denny's or something in the US and it was something like 100CHF+ just for the two of us. But if you go into a little cafe or sandwich shop you can get stuff to eat much cheaper. 

Even places like McDonald's and Burger King are more expensive here than in the US, lol.

As allready said, don't take taxis. Taxis are very expensive.

About hotels: Reservations might be a good idea. Free rooms can be quite expensive if you have to find one on the go and in some places it can even be impossible to find a free room. Of course it's not that a problem if you want to stay in bigger cities. But if you want to stay somewhere in the alps, reservations might be better.

true,kitsune,null,null,"Ticino is missing on the list. It's splendid in summer and you can easily cross the border and visit Lake Como in Italy. 

Locarno is very beautiful, Ascona is near, and if you travel a little bit southwards, to Lugano (40km from Locarno) it's only a measly 30km trip to Como in Italy. There are some very nice B&amp;B's in Locarno that don't cost a fortune.

Zurich - Lugano is a 2:37 train ride.

Edit: I just checked, [The Film Festival of Locarno](http://www.pardo.ch/jahia/Jahia/home) is from Aug 1 to Aug 11. So the place will probably be packed and the hotel prices a bit higher (just book early). But it's definitely a cool experience.

Of course Berne / Lake Thun / Interlaken / Bernese Alps is also beautiful, but come on, everyone is going there.

true,Schmich,vs,Valais,"Most likely with the Swisscom line ""tax"". Swisscom used to be fully owned by the government and so owns all the copper lines. Anyone who uses them has to pay around 25,25CHF every month. It's a hefty sum but there isn't much you can do about that unless you go with Fiber or have wireless broadband.

Personally I can recommend VTX. See my other post.",0,1335545427,null,0,false,0,c4hbaa2,t3_ssbid,t1_c4hbaa2,t1_c4gl5zz,null,1428808680,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
true,Schmich,vs,Valais,"VTX.ch has pretty a good deal. For 34:- you get up to 10Mbps and a phone service, although do note that this will use VOIP (meaning fax or alarm won't work on it). I do say ""up to"" since if you're far up the mountain you might get much lower speeds. They also have a 2Mbps for 24:- if ever. Calling a fixed line in the Netherlands costs you 5cents per minute and is totally free if you choose the 20Mbps 57:- per month subscription. If you only take a 1 year contract with them you have to pay 75:- for activation, free if you take 2 years: http://vtx.ch/internet-connexions-surf-and-phone-formules-et-prix

Do note that whatever provider you take you're gonna have to pay an extra 25,25 or sometimes 25,35 per month which goes to Swisscom (as they own all copper lines). For example if you take VTX they will charge you 34 + 25,25 and they'll pay Swisscom after, so there's no hassle in that sense. However extra 25 every month is not cheap. This is the same if you go with Sunrise or Swisscom or whatever.

The only way to avoid that monthly cost is to go with fiber (which I doubt your house would have) or go with wireless broadband. For wireless broadband you can just test on your phone (if you have a Swisscom SIM, otherwise you'll be doing some expensive roaming) at your house. See what speeds you'll get. There is no 4G in Switzerland yet so you'll be stuck with high latency (around 100ms minimum) 3G meaning you cannot really do FPS gaming. Also, with mobile broadband you'll be stuck with a download limit. The best provider here will be Swisscom with their advanced 3G infrastructure: http://www.swisscom.ch/res/internet/mobile-unlimited/tarife/index.htm

The old Tele2 in Switzerland changed name to Tele4u, they might also be something to look at. One thing you can do, no matter what provider you take, is to use the Tele4u's phone network/service so you can get cheaper calls for MOBILE phones to the Netherlands. Some countries have the same mobile rates as fixed ones and the Netherlands (Pays-Bas) is one of them. I don't know if you have to register with Tele4u, you should give them a call and see. All I know is that ever since I grew up, my parents told me to type ""10753"" (which it Tele4u's prefix number that makes you connect to them) before I called anyone. There is no monthly cost and you just pay what you call. There is some type of registering possible, but I don't know if it makes your phone always call 10753 or if you need to do that anyway. Just call Tele4u and ask them about calling through 10753 and how that works. Calling fixed or mobile in Netherlands costs you 10c per minute and that's very cheap for mobile.",0,1335546605,null,0,true,0,c4hbjky,t3_ssbid,t1_c4hbjky,t3_ssbid,null,1428808870,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
