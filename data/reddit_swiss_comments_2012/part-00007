true,ours,vd,Vaud,"&gt;Swiss administration is the world's most moronic administration

You can ignore that part. It's wasteful and there are moronic things but it's a freaking Ferrari compared to most of the World.

On the other hand the army is currently very unpopular. It's regarded as a useless waste of money because we are such a peaceful country that could put that money to better uses. The militia service is particularly the biggest waste as young people mostly seem to waste time running around, getting bored, burning tax-payer money to ineffectively learn how to fight an unlikely war.

That's why I recommended you join the professional army not that I personally support the army in any way.

Frankly I'd rather you came, got a job, took the time to discover your nation (like I have many years ago) before jumping into the paradox that is the Swiss army. At the same time it's a peculiarly Swiss thing while being a very un-Swiss thing (peace and neutrality vs. military).",0,1327141876,null,0,false,0,c3j4zde,t3_ooq1y,t1_c3j4zde,t1_c3j4kbi,null,1428213785,5,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,5

true,zupatol,ge,Genève,"What basic military skills do you think may be useful in an increasingly uncertain world? Firing a cannon? If you know specifically what you want to learn, you will be able to learn it much more effectively by yourself. Anything the army teaches is very simple and repetitive because it must stick even on the most unmotivated idiots.

I wonder what positive things you expect from military discipline. It's much more useful to learn self-discipline, but you don't need that in the army.

Military service for me was like falling back into childhood. You give up any responsibility for guaranteed shelter and food, and other people take decisions for you. It's kind of nice because it makes you worry less, but it shields you from the important questions that face you when you are young, like the question of what you are going to do with your life.

The only positive thing I see in the army is that you get a picture of society, people are thrown together wherever they come from, and it would give you a unique perspective on Switzerland. I actually wish there was another way of being thrown together with random people for a while.

true,zupatol,ge,Genève,"Unless it has changed a lot, there is no training about high pressure situations like being shot at. No one in the swiss army has ever been in a fighting situation. The swiss army has actually never fought a ever.

As a soldier you won't need any people skills, but maybe you can learn more by becoming a caporal. I didn't do that but my impression is that caporals have the same general level of incompetence as the soldiers, and not much responsibility, and the position has the reputation of being the worst in the army because  you're squeezed between the soldiers and the rest of the hierarchy. Caporals usually aim to become lieutenants, who have more responsibility and most I've seen seemed generally competent and knowledgeable, so I guess this would teach you some things. But it takes a lot of time and effort to become lieutenant.
