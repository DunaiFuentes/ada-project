true,thebrokendoctor,be,Bern,"Swiss-Canadian here, going to Switzerland for a month and a bit in about two weeks, and I've been there before many times. Keep in mind, this is coming from a person with Swiss citizenship. If you don't have it, many things can/will cost more.

1) Tickets will run anywhere from $1000-$2000, figure out your travel dates and buy early, the prices can go up by several hundred in a matter of days. Also, it gives you time to look for deals, and see if it is better (read: cheaper) to fly direct or through places like Heathrow, Frankfurt, or Amsterdam. I've flown Lufthansa, Air Canada, and Swiss Air and all of them have been great though I can't remember how large the variance is between prices. 

2) Answering this later.

3) Yes there are, and they can be gotten [here](http://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets.html). They are expensive, but worthwhile if you're staying there for several months as they allow you to travel anywhere in Switzerland and makes travelling through Europe if you wish easier as well. Euro travel by train is standard, and much easier and better than anything in America/Canada.

4) Okay, here's the downer bit. This trip will cost a very large amount. Eating out is expensive. Good hotels are very expensive, while okay hotels are expensive. As you can see with the rail passes and airline tickets, transportation is expensive. Renting a car isn't worthwhile because of how efficient the train system is (my own opinion, though I've never heard otherwise). Right now, for my month and a half trip (even cutting out a small trip to Belgium I'll be making) where I'll be living in student residences at the University of Geneva, the trip is running me a little over $10,000 when I factor in food and living expenses. Switzerland is expensive. It is beautiful and wonderful and the closest thing to perfection in many ways I feel when I am there, but it is an expensive place to live or visit. You can differ some of the costs by living in hostels, buying and cooking your own food and such, but it will still run you a very high amount. It is worth it to go, and you will remember it for the rest of your life, but just keep that in mind.

2) Back here, I wanted to get number four out of the way so I can address this. Now that you know it's expensive, how long you stay is really up to how much your wallet can handle. If you are able to stay for a few months or whatnot, then do so. There are so many festivals and such worth seeing (Montreux Jazz Festival is world famous and there are enormous amounts of well known groups and bands from many genres that go through here; Circus Knie is world famous as well, and is what Cirque du Soleil is based on, though Knie is much better), and going out to see so many different places in the Alps is great. The nice thing about Switzerland is that because it's so small, you can be most anywhere and still be able to go the the Alps whenever you feel like. I stayed in Bern one summer and went to the Alps every few days. On clear days I was able to see the Alps from where I was staying in Bern, which was one of the most beautiful sights I've seen in my life. When you're in Switzerland, go everywhere that you can. Go to the north and east and see the German influences and such, then go to the west and see all of the French influences, and then go to the south and see all the Italian influences. Every part is so different from each other in so many ways, and it makes the country so much more beautiful.
