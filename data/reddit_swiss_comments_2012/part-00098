Rent in Switzerland is paid monthly. CHF 700 would be on the cheaper side for a small, probably older, studio apartment in Zürich or Geneva. For a 4-room apartment - 2 to 3 thousand maybe, although rent drops off in suburbs.

If you are seeing prices in EUR I'm assuming you are looking in or around Geneva.  If you search around this subreddit we've had a few threads here that list a lot of websites, some especially for geneva.  

EDIT: [This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/uomyq/a_requestquestion_for_redditors_of_rswitzerland/) has a lot of links to housing search engines and classifieds. There's a low vacancy rate in Geneva and Zürich, so finding housing is a bit of a challenge.

Also, you'll find it very difficult (impossible) to get a place before you're on the ground here. The rental market is extremely tight, so every place has dozens of applicants. It's not first come, first served, it's whoever the landlord (or agency) likes best. So I recommend getting a temporary apartment for a month, from where you can start applying for apartments. If you're transferring with your employer, then they'll likely fix you up with a temporary place, and maybe a relocation agent to help you sort out the work visa and meldebestätigung stuff, and help you make apartment applications.
