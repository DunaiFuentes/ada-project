I think you should at least go once to the mountains for tramping. Awesome panoramas will be for sure!

What goes in that direction and is always worth a day is the openair museum Balenberg. http://ballenberg.ch/en/Welcome 
You can even see how it was done some years ago...:) You should try at least the sausage and the bread!

true,Vlip,be,Bern,"You'll be a short 20 minutes of Bern, the capital city and an awesome medieval town.
Go there via train, visit the federal palace (it's free), see the old town, say hi to the bears in the bear park and then go to the marzili pool (free) and swim in the river.

40 minutes away is Thun, another awesome city with a medieval center and a breath taking panorama on the alps behind the lake.
Visit the castle, go to the swimming pool and go swim in the lake with the alps as backdrop.

20 minutes away is Morat/Murten, another awesome medieval village with walls all around it. Take a walk on the city walls, go to the lake and take a swim.

1hr away is Neuchâtel with it's very unique yellow buildings, very pretty city on the lake side. You can go swim in the lake too (I think you see  the  trend here).

1h15m away is Lausanne, the city itself is not particularly interesting but the setting is amazingly pretty (lake, mountains, you know the drill).
Go to ouchy and board the steamer boat to Castle Chillon, this is a 45 m boat ride in a dream panorama which ends up with you landing right next to one of the coolest medieval castle in Switzerland. Visit the castle, go to the little beach next to it and swim around it ;).
Then you can walk back to Montreux (guess what, you can swim in the lake  there too) and take the train back to Lausanne.

That'd be my recommendations but I'm sure others will bombard you with mountain thrills.",0,1330414803,null,0,false,0,c3vsbzi,t3_q8vn4,t1_c3vsbzi,t3_q8vn4,null,1428434320,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

We sometimes think our local administration takes itself a little bit too seriously, thus the playing off. Most subjects are obvious, some not so much. There is  - as you may notice when you talk to the active part of the Fasnacht - a heavy competition among the cliques. 

I saw a lantern with the superimposed images. This one even quipped that the strong Swiss Franc (and every other stronger than average currency) will crack the Euro. A possibility, but not a probable one. ",0,1330490583,null,0,true,0,c3w440y,t3_q9x1r,t1_c3w440y,t3_q9x1r,null,1428439557,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
