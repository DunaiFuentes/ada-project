true,chromopila,zh,Zürich,"Yay Zurzach!

I grew up there! Zurzach has nothing spectacular for tourists, the only thing that i would consider interesting are the hotsprings, but spending an entire day there would be boring too.

If you have half a day off, I would suggest a trip to Baden. it's a half an hour away by train, and you got two trains per hour, so it's quite easy to get there. Baden has a lovely [historic centre](http://www.swisstherme.ch/attachments/Image/Aargau/Baden/Baden_Altstadt.jpg) with a [ruin](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Baden_Ruine_Stein_7873.jpg) on top from where you have a beautiful panorama over the whole city. There are some nice restaurants and coffeehouses as well, feel free to ask if you are looking for something in particular. The nightlife in Baden isn't that bad too. Of course Zürich has more to offer, but i promise that you wont get bored that quickly in Baden. A big advantage is that it is much easier to reach than Zürich, and it takes you only half as long to get there.

Another thing to do would be a trip to the black forest, it's in germany, but Zurzach is next to the border and within 10minutes you're already in the black forest. It's not as spectacular as the alps, but if you dont have the time to travel all across switzerland it could be a nice alternative. For day trips I suggest the region around the [Schluchsee](http://www.sonium-fishing.de/wp-content/uploads/schluchsee_kaiserbucht.jpg) and Feldberg(I hope i wont get stoned to death by my fellow swiss people for suggesting a german destination)

Protip: call it just ""Zurzach"". The ""Bad"" has been added a few years ago as a marketing idea to make the hot springs more popular(Bad means bath or spa). Most citizens of Zurzach don't like it at all.",0,1351850768,null,0,1351851595,0,c6v981m,t3_12e1sa,t1_c6v981m,t3_12e1sa,null,1430300023,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3
