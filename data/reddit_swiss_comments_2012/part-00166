true,canteloupy,vd,Vaud,"It's truly very difficult to do things to help people who are aggressively self-destructive.

It's very disenheartening. Basically, the left wing has to battle the right wing who accuses it of angelism and naiveté and just wants to put everyone in jail and take away their welfare money. Then, when you finally get a project through, the people you're doing it for shit all over it and you look stupid. Still, I'm not mad at the junkies. I also think that they can't be helped and there will always be a crowd of druggies who just hangs out somewhere arguing and getting drunk in plain sight. I've never been anywhere that doesn't have one, except in rural areas where people just do this at the local bar minus the heroin/cocaine and they're the ones complaining about spending money on the drunks in the city.

I just think the best we can do is indeed monitoring. The idea that a bar could make money while serving them though seems full of crap from the start. I think it should be straight up publicly financed and have security as well as health personnel. It costs money to prevent people from killing themselves, though, and many really don't care if the druggies die. So it's not a very popular idea. In addition the drug addicts aren't the most cooperative people ever.",0,1353921333,null,0,false,0,c76wjcg,t3_13sws7,t1_c76wjcg,t3_13sws7,null,1430502394,6,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,6

I agree with everything you said, but especially with this point. How did they think this was going to work, when even normal bars and pubs struggle to make ends meet?

I agree with your suggestion, though. If you don't want druggies on the street, give them a place to go. It's pretty simple. We have publically financed places for the young, the old, the sick and dying, even for those on vacation. Why not have ones for the addicted?",0,1353924810,null,0,false,0,c76wwdi,t3_13sws7,t1_c76wwdi,t1_c76wjcg,null,1430502565,4,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,4

I agree as well.  I think the limited amount of availability for addicts is because of the social stigma associated with illegal drugs.  I'm not sure about Switzerland, but in the US there are some in the general community that believe drug users get treated as people who made poor decisions and therefore ""deserve"" whatever they get, instead of treating them as people with a disorder who need treatment.  Another issue is that psychologists struggle with a cohesive and comprehensive model to treat addiction.

Then there is always the discussion about whether to legalize illegal substances in order to regulate, tax, and control the flow of the drugs.  This type of experiment is playing out in the American states of Colorado and Washington where marijuana was recently legalized for recreational purposes.  Time will tell if this is just a Pandora's box of drug advocacy run rampant or a sign of the times where an industry was born.
