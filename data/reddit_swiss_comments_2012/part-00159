This might also interest you, that when I applied to both English as well as Scottish Universities for my Bachelor I did so with AP (Advanced Placement - the american equivalent to the IB) and had no problem with it whatsoever. There are plenty of conversion tables out there - I recall I had to convert my AP grades according to the subject they were in and the grade I got into UCAS points. For each University I needed a certain number of UCAS points to get in.

Personally I would finish my maturité in CH and then apply either to a College or University in Scotland. Be aware that a College is not the same thing as a University in the UK. While americans often use these two terms interchangeably, there is a difference between the two of them in the UK.

Gasoline is heavily taxed. Power is about the double compared to the US. Everything else follows. 
Switzerland has some social areas that are thoroughly regulated, but still have a relative high competition. Such as medicine and public transport. Those a high service, high price areas. If you need one, you pay. Then there is just the high price stuff like TV license fees (that is how the British call it, IIRC) and eating in a restaurant. Supermarkets are supertidy, but also superexpensive. Tidy over cheap is the norm. 
Immigration, especially by well educated, younger to middle age, is growing. Hence the falling average wage and salary, hence the growing grudge about that. You do not encounter this grudge in diverse areas or on your work, especially if you do it over the net (Cpt. Obvious was typing...). 
Internet is expensive here. If the company pays you to have several dozens of megabits, they will be shocked after seeing what you pay here for several megabits. Some areas have fiber, some don't. Some villages have 50 to 100Mbit/s, but they do not shout it from their rooftops. Or get a combined plan (same as in the US). Otoh, you can get DSL even in the remotest areas and 3G has a decent coverage, not only, but mostly because of tourism. Expect none in some areas in the Jura mountains.
