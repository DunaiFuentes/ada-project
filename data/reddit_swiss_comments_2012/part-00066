true,[deleted],null,null,"Well...as an American living in Switzerland I will say I don't think it's ""backwards"" here but it is quite different than the US and some people may view certain things as backwards. For example, most shops/grocery stores/etc. close fairly early compared to the US and many are not open at all on Sunday (though some are). 

Religion seems to me like a weird thing here...the cantons are all (as I understand it) either officially Catholic or Protestant and when you move somewhere you have to register as one or the other (you can choose to register as nothing though I believe; my husband registered us as Protestant even though neither of us are religious but I don't remember what his reason for doing so was). So it seems like religion is still a pretty big part of society but it seems from my perspective like it's just a sort of tradition, and not really anything like, say, the Bible belt in the US or something. 

I believe what batiste refers to in his/her post about the women voting thing is that it was as late as 1980 or 81 when one of the cantons finally gave women that right (I am not sure at what point the other cantons had done so)...compared to the US I suppose that seems a little backwards. 

People here can also be pretty funny about certain things...I have read stories about people who threatened to call the police on their neighbors for putting the trash out on a non trash day or something like that...things like that. People seem to be really big on sticking to the rules with those kinds of things. 

Overall I would say, from my point of view, your assessment of Switzerland is pretty accurate; I personally think it's a more intelligent and progressed country right now than the US, but then again, I haven't grown up here so perhaps it's much different from a native's perspective.

Here, that would rarely happen, especially not if you have religious relatives.

I feel like everything's linked to that certain environment we grew up in, which might be still a bit too much conservative here.. but I've a feeling that those kind of aspects are slowly dieing out as times goes on.  Families don't go to church as often as they used to be, religion isn't playing a big role anymore, etc. 

My gf's family used to be strongly religious. They would pray in the evening, participate in anything related to it. Thus her mom forces her, and her siblings, to go to church every Sunday. They don't mind, but it's not something they're looking forward to. I went with them there a few times, and it's barely if they're listening to what's being said, their views have changed aswell. So my gf believes in God, has certain principles, but is a sinner on stuff that you would've been bashed for twenty years ago (sex before marriage, ..). And I doubt that the day she'll have children, she'll force them to do what she did during her childhood because of her family's beliefs.

Nope - Cantons are not religious. But you pay your church via your tax forms, that's why the state asks you. Something I find very weird too, btw.

But if you're not member of a church you do not have to register as one, and you will not get ""taxed"". Depending on your income, this could make a couple of hundreds/thousands of Swiss franks.
