What's wrong with being called a forum? Reddit fits that definition completely, and the term goes back all the way to ancient Rome.

true,vincchan,sg,St. Gallen,"The problem with the term forum is that in forums, posts are displayed chronologically, which means whoever comments first will be showed above (before?) all others that follow. Simply saying that reddit is a forum doesn't do it justice because the community has a lot of influence on what the most interesting comment is / will be, thus letting others know to pay more attention to it. Just think about doing an AMA in a forum, it will be a catastrophy of quotes and half of what you're writing will be lost in the sheer of number of dumb questions. That is the reason why the social in ""Social News Aggregator"" is so important. And of course the same process applies to the ""front page"", giving an overview over news redditors find best.
