i actually never heard your case from friend who served in the army, but i am convinced, that if you persevere, they will let you do your service.

questions i have to think of are how would it be managed with the wks (wiederholungskurs = repetition course). you have to do 3 weeks of them a year for the following ten years after finishing the 16 weeks rs (rekrutenschule = recruit school). Another question, you probably won't be allowed to take home your gun as citicens in switzerland do. Another question, you usually are discharged from saturday morning to sunday afternoon during recruit school, so if you could manage to trace some relatives in switzerland where you can stay saturday over night would solve at least this problem.

anyways. do not overestimate the trainging you get there. If you don't get into one of the advanced forces, the skills you learn are worth shit. however i encourage you and your brother to do so, i earn about 1600.-sfr a month while you only spend money for alcohol (but therefrom a lot), you can easily make some savings.

I gather you are double citizen (Swiss and South African) in which case you might want to get in contact with Mr Markus Wenger

A few additional points:

* At the age of 23 and 26 resp. you are already at the top end of the age scale to start with military service. You will have but only younger teammates and officers. 

* The military service in Switzerland is quite unusual in its form. As a soldier (no rank) you have to fulfill 300 days of service which can be reached differently: a) You start with a 21-week ""boot camp"" and recurring 3 week-services on a yearly basis or b) You do all days of service in one go which takes 10 months

* If you consider ranking up (which is quite easy as the Swiss military is chronically short of higher ranked staff) you add a few hundred days for each rank (corporal, sergeant, lieutenant…).

* You can even join the professional army (as opposed to the militia, the compulsory military service for 300 days) and go to the [Military Academy in Zürich](http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/en/home/schweizerarmee/organisation/hkaneu.html) for a professional career in military services.

* Skills / Training depends vastly on the department you choose. Infantry (""Grenadier"") is certainly more physically challenging than first aid, and parachute scouts have a stricter training than communication and transmission soldiers. Usually you complete a physical and mental test beforehand and depending on its result you are able to ask to join a specific department, otherwise they put you wherever they need soldiers.

* Language will certainly be an issue sometimes but generally I wouldn't consider it as a showstopper. During my time we always had a few French or Italian speaking guys and we settled either on one of the Swiss languages or switched to English. BUT - not speaking a single word in German OR French is certainly not advantageous. A big part of doing military service is bonding, making friends, trying to have a good time while crawling through mud. Buy them beers or weed until they speak English or you German.

* Money is something you need to look into as well. You don't get paid enough to support yourself while off duty (which is every weekend from Saturday morning to Sunday night). It helps if you have friends / family where you have a room to stay but you still need cash to pay for your living expenses.

Is it a good idea? Well, if you like doing military training, opting for a challenging department and want to make some friends in Switzerland, yes of course. But it's not something you should compare with what you see on telly and certainly different to all the countries with a standing professional army.

The army is dropping out of popularity very fast among the young so someone whiling to come from half-way around the globe to serve is quite unusual.
