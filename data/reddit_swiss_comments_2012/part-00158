true,anyone-but-me,bs,Basel-Stadt,"Well, I don't have any sources on it either, but according to my bf it'd cost about £200 to do highers at a college. And SAAS wouldn't pay for it, sadly. 


Update: [Edinburgh College](http://www.stevenson.ac.uk/courses/course/higher-english-1213-course/) (formerly Telford College) offer highers at £180 per subject. Compared with the Certificate of Advanced English (CAE), which you can take from the [Basil Paterson College](http://www.basilpaterson.co.uk/ielts_cambridge_exams/cambridge_esol.html) for £120, I think it's probably wise to go for the latter :) 


Note: I took the CAE in my first year here and got an A, which was more than enough for my uni, but Heriot-Watt might want a slightly different certificate - you should be able to find out online which one they prefer.

true,kitsune,null,null,"Fribourg is a true student / college town, so its night life, especially on work days, is surprisingly good for a town of its size. For instance, [Fri-Son](http://www.fri-son.ch/) is a place with very good parties / concerts / club nights. I mean, looking at the current line up I already see artists like Woodkid, Xiu Xiu, Benga and Flying Lotus on the list. Definitely not bad for a town with 35,680 inhabitants. Also, drinks and so on are usually very reasonably priced compared to the rest of Switzerland!

There are a lot of Swiss-German students in Fribourg, especially its law school has a very good reputation. A lot of those students travel home during the weekend or semester breaks. The town itself is bi-lingual but it's fair to say that French is the more common language.

You have nice bars and cafés such as the [Café du Belvédère](https://www.facebook.com/cafebelvedere/photos_stream), great views, or the [Café Populaire](http://www.flickr.com/photos/8102644@N04/3874039064/in/photostream) (Good burgers). 

If you are fed up with the city you can always travel to nearby places, be it other cities such as Lausanne or Berne, or even Zurich, or travel to the country side (Maybe the Bernese Alps or Gruyères)...

My brother studied in Fribourg and he lived there for over 4 years, so if you have any question I can relay them to him.

By the way, Fribourg can be fucking cold and windy during winter days. So it's good you only plan to spend a summer there :)

true,Napoleon_Knopfler,ge,Genève,"So.

There are few places you can go to in Geneva without meeting packs of tourists. I'll start with saying where you shouldn't go:

-the flower clock. Situated next to a eight lane road, it's noisy and you just go there to spend a half-second taking a picture.

-the water jet. Only tourists go there. You won't ever find one genevois around this place—it's pretty far from town and you have a pretty nice view of it from the banks of the city anyway.

-the UN headquarters are kind of your choice. They're pretty neat but really far, and I don't think the visit is worth it.

Now, onwards to cool things.

-the bourg-de-four. You'll see tourists walking around but these terraces are really chill. almost all the restaurants are nice, and the beer is usually tasty, though quite expensive ~7CHF.

-the park of the bastions. I don't know where you come from, but this is like our central park. If it's sunny, go there, buy yourself a crepe at the wooden caban (don't know if it's gonna be open) and enjoy the [free giant chess sets](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gntHNgKbqdA/To0mAfMJuFI/AAAAAAAAC5E/_tmmRU77YlA/s1600/Europe+2011+293.JPG)

-If you wanna go party at night, l'Usine is the place to go. It's actually the only decent place you can go to. It happens that they have some really cool line-ups. It's mostly DnB and dubstep these days, but they also have rock gigs, though less often. Price varies between ~10-30CHF. Be aware tha if you come before 11:30 pm, you're probably only going to meet overly attached weed dealers.

-The cathedral is a nice sight, and if I recall correctly it's free. 

-[Le bain des paquis](http://www.zenvirons.ch/etablissement/images/343.jpg) is the best place to eat a fondue. You'll have to reserve your table, because it's quite popular among genevois.

-The museum of art and history is pretty cool too, and it was free last time I visited. Also [the building is worth the sight.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Mus%C3%A9e_d%27art_et_d%27histoire,_Gen%C3%A8ve.jpg)

Now I realize my recommendations would rather apply for a summer trip. It's probably going to be cold as it gets. Snow, rain and the local wind, called ""la bise"" kinda ruin a lot of things. Maybe you'll be able to see the lakeside [freeze](http://notrehistoire.ch.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/2009/10/e6dccbbc9c2e51cf.jpg)
