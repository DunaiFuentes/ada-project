true,D49A1D852468799CAC08,zh,Zürich,"I looked it up for you, it seems that anecdotally people who can't speak German or French are rejected from military service. You'll have to pay an extra tax of 3% of your income for the next 10 years or so though. 

I haven't met any other Kiwis, although I've heard about a few here and there. People either assume I'm from England or the US if I don't tell them where I'm from. 

Biggest changes to be prepared for: 

* Far more people smoke. It's still socially acceptable here. I've done more passive smoking in the last 6 months just by walking down the street than in the rest of my life put together. 

* Meat is really expensive, other food items are about the same though. Enjoy a few good steaks before you leave, because once you get here you'll be paying NZD 80 - 120 per *kilo*.

* People are typically a lot older when they start their career. I started working in NZ straight out of uni and my colleagues were all the same age as me. Now here I'm in the same position I left in NZ, but all my colleagues are in the same role are 5 - 10 years older than me. 

* It's a crowded country, really densely populated, so everyone lives close together and apartment living is normal. However people realise this, and you generally don't have trouble with noisy neighbours etc. 

* Public transport is awesome, as a consequence of everyone living closer together. 

* I know it's a cliché, but it really is harder to make friends here. I've been having some success recently though, and last week received my first invitation to a Swiss person's house (well, apartment). 

* Another cliché is that ""everyone speaks English"". This one isn't true. I'm always running into people who can't speak English, especially when I urgently need to ask them something...

* Everyone has a lot more disposable income. There aren't really any poor people, as we would understand it. It's a *really* wealthy country. 

Also, I recommend you start some German lessons ASAP when you get here. You really need to get a grounding in the basics before you can start to practice and improve by yourself. ",0,1346354323,null,0,false,0,c612wlg,t3_z084w,t1_c612wlg,t1_c60ti8j,null,1429775963,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

true,TVintern,null,null,"Awesome! Thank you for looking that up for me! I am not too worried about 3% to be honest. As long as I can earn and travel, then I am happy :)

* Smoking will take some time to get used to I guess but it has never bothered me massively before. I guess it is just something I will have to learn to accept.

* Shiiiit. That is really expensive for a cut of meat. Crazy. I guess I can learn to adapt. It will be like being a student all over again. Hopefully cheap mince and chicken will be easy to come by. Either that, or I could try markets etc I guess.

* I don't think age will be a concern for me as I don't think I can work in my career over there anyway. I only speak English and need much more of that for working in Media!

* ok, thats cool. I am planning on hopefully getting an apartment eventually (just to rent). I imagine coming across a house will be much more expensive to rent. I have never lived in an apartment before so it will be a good new experience.

* I LOVE the Swiss public transport system. It is amazing :D I was there in January and it blew me away. Sure as hell beats the busses that are never on time here in NZ! 

* I already have a few friends over there so hopefully I will be able to hang out with them and meet people through them. If not - will post on reddit or look to go to a meet up! Plus part of the fun of travelling is getting out of your comfort zone so will try make friends anyway I can! haha

* I definitely want to learn German so going to try and use English as a back up only. Will get a few lessons before I shoot across.

* Interesting. Auckland is so diverse so I am used to a mix range. Hopefully I will be lucky enough to be one of those people with a high disposable income also!

Thank you so much for your help! It is really great to hear this sort of stuff. I want to be as prepared as possible!
