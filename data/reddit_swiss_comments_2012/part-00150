* go to Vevey and walk along the lake of geneva to Montreux, if you have time you can even walk a bit further and take look at [Castle Chillon](http://www.chillon.ch/en/) 
* Go to Lauterbrunnen-Tal.

* see the Aletschgletscher, probably one of the most beautiful sights in switzerland, many ways to see this, I'd suggest via 'Bettmeralp'. it's getting cold though, better go there asap
* Aareschlucht (station 'Aareschlucht West', via Meiringen), an impressive gorge near Interlaken, ideal for a relaxed day-trip from Bern, if you have time, take the Boat from Brienz back to Interlaken (though Interlaken itself is not really worth seeing imho)
* generally, check out the smaller villages near Bern like Thun (it's really a fairytale place, take a boatride on the Thunersee if you have time), Solothurn or Biel
* If you haven't been there, check out Lausanne. So near, yet the mentality &amp; culture of the people is completely different and just really 'french'.
