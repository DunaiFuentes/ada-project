* Money: Country's filthy rich on a global scale. However, in most urban areas and the remote mountain towns, there are more and more working poor. This is because real estate in cities in demand and the mountain towns have become tourist hotspots and prices rose over time.
* Jobs: As a high-qualified something, finding a job is easy. The Swiss pride themselves on their high educational standards, but because Switzerland is and will remain in the backwater of global everything, the really good people who want to make a name for themselves move away. They go to places that are more on the global map and actually have impact other than ""lol clocks"".
* Girls: No. Just no. You have the girls from the country, that occasionally stem from families with circular family trees. Then you have girls of the former yugoslavian countries. They are absolutely stunning from age 16 to maybe 25 and then they age sixty years over night and gain 150lbs. That's not to say that there aren't any attractive women, but Swiss Girls aren't like Sweden's where everyone on the planet goes ""Goddamn, Swedish Girls are hot!"" If you want the country's most gorgeous, google Miss Schweiz and go to the official site.
* The country's stupidly small. To cross it, it takes you five hours by train. By car, about three, depending on the traffic in and around Zürich.
* Food: It varies. It can be atrocious or delicious. While a lot of it is, in fact, cheese based, I recommend you check out the sweets.
* English: Most people have at least a rudimentary understanding of the language. They might not speak it, but if you articulate yourself clearly enough, you get by. Even the oldest geezers are able to tell you where something is or what something's called. Just be patient. Do not, under any circumstances, try any other foreign language, including French. If you happen to find yourself in the French or Italian part, do not try any other language than French or Italian or English.
* Arabs, like all other foreigners that are not rich and western, are reviled. They're tolerated, but nowhere near accepted. If you go around, proclaiming proudly that this is your land and that you are Swiss in your heart without speaking a single word of any of the national languages, they will hate you. They will go out of their way to not have to help you and they will - and this they do without provocation - put rumours out about you. You'll find yourself labelled a drug dealer, you'll rape women and you'll be a terrorist. Given this situation, the arabs are marginalized and mostly meet up in Kebab restaurants where they sulk and pretend to not speak a word of German or French or Italian. There is no such thing as Chinatown, or Little Arabia or anything. There is Swiss culture everywhere and you must conform.

General pointers: 

* As much as you love Switzerland, stop referring to it as ""my country"" the second you actually enter it. You might have citizenship, but as the twats say ""They give that to everyone these days."" 
* Don't go around liking everyone. The Swiss are notoriously private. Do not ask many questions about their families, their lives, their interior design or their pets, let alone their work. Keep to yourself and be helpful. Then they'll open up, eventually.

You know what surprised me the most? 61% of people placed themselves on the left side of the political spectrum, yet 58 percent consider ""Freedom - Liberal"" as the most important factor. How does that match up? Or did most people just understand the term in the US style, where I too would place myself on the left side of the middle? Or is it me that misunderstands the term?
