Swype works similar. You don't tip every letter individually but just swipe your finger from letter to letter until you've written the whole word. The phone has a dictionary and looks up which word you most likely meant to write. This is very accurate and works similar and much better than the old T1 dictionary on feature (dumb) phones where you only had to push the button with the letter you wanted once instead of exactly indicating which one you wanted (by pressing twice on 2 for b and thrice for c).

As you say, it's not a tragedy. It's a hassle. And for the convenience of not having this hassle, you want to make people work in stores on Sundays?  
  
You know, first, they will do this for the small stores ""without employees"". Please define ""store without employees"". What is that? A Selecta machine?  
  
So, the big ones who are excluded from this right now, will then begin to lobby to also be included in this. And then the bigger part of over 86'000 employees of Migros and over 70'000 employees of Coop will be fucked. Because they will make them work. If they don't, they will have to leave. If they leave, they will have to be replaced. Who will they replace them with? Foreigners who are ready to work for a better wage than they do in their countries. This will make the Swiss who just lost their jobs angry and this anger will fuel SVP's next campaign in the coming election round. And then, who knows, they will ban people Beards or something. 
  
I'm just saying that stuff like this kills families. Mothers and Fathers will not be home at Sunday to sit down with their children and have a nice Sunday Brunch or whatever. Instead, their kids will watch the television program and will learn even more how it is important to buy stuff, because that's what makes a person's net worth nowadays and that's why mommy and daddy are not home today, because all the other people are out there buying stuff and mommy and daddy need to accommodate that need and that's what their children will be doing in the future, when they grow up. First hang around the mall, having no money, later getting a job to get money to buy more stuff!    
  
Step by step it's all part of the overall social degradation of our beautiful country. By itself, it's nice to be able to go and buy stuff on Sunday. Soon, we'll be like other countries. It's not going to matter who you are and what you think and who you love, who you hate or how you come to think of something, because it's more important what color your new car has and how the movie star looks better because she got botox in her face.

That's true. However, the situation was similar in Italy after unification in the 19th century, where only ~10% of people could speak the dialect we now know as ""standard Italian"". Similar things happened in England, Germany, and France as the standard languages became more important over the regional dialects, and dialects are now little more than accents.
