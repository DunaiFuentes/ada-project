Housing can be found in the 500-700 CHF range. I think 1500-1700CHF per month is about right for total expenses. Housing is cheap enough in Basel that living in the French or German suburbs isn't worth it. Shopping in Germany is pretty common, though.

- [regional travel card](http://www.tnw.ch/tickets-und-preise/abonnemente/u-abo/) depending on age (if under 25, you won the jackpot of a subsidized card) around 700 to 950 *a year*
- [social activities](http://denkmal.org/) and the list from [unibas](http://unibas.ch/index.cfm?5F1E34FF07E242948835DB304339EEAF)
- sometimes, [he](http://www.ronorp.net/basel/) knows something
- buy staple foods in Germany (because otherwise you only subsidize the importers) on places like [this one](http://www.marktkauf.de/marktkauf/de/index.html) especially oil, flour. But not meat and eggs. cheap on energy, expensive on produce is the right way.
- on page 31 from [this pdf](http://www.rektorat.ethz.ch/students/immigration/handbook.pdf) they talk about waste disposal. [this site for Basel](http://www.tiefbauamt.bs.ch/dokumente/abfallkalender.htm) and every other county/commune has its own scheme.
- there are [some](http://www.tiefbauamt.bs.ch/dokumente/abfallkalender.htm) [other sites](http://unibas.ch/index.cfm?5F1C3557F6800139B2C84A1609122FF2)   [to explore](http://www.studentenwohnheim.ch/basel/). Sorry, most Links are in German, but a little google-trickery could help you to find email adresses to ask directly. 
- in case of a serious illnes but not an emergency avoid the hospital if possible. an adress of a doctor noted in advance helps you much faster. if you do not bleed, you wait up to 10 hours in the emergency area...
- for buying stuff there are so called ""Brockenstuben"" (thrift shops, second-hand furniture warehouse) e.g. [this one](http://brocki.ch/basel/index.cfm)
- btw, [this site](http://dict.leo.org/) knows those weird [helvetisms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetism)
- in general, everybody speaks some English. The university of Basel is mostly catering to German speaking students, while other universities are more international. Or they like to be. The research departments otoh are almost one person, one origin.
