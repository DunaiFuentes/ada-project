true,fondueguy,null,null,"&gt;What kind of bugs me about conscription though is that it's discriminatory. It shouldn't be just the guys that lose 300+ days on a glorified boyscout exercise. Women are just as capable as men, so why should they get off scot free?

Another bonus of adding women to the draft would mean the country wouldn't send troops for frivolous reasons.

I don't think something as dumb as Vietnam would have happened if women were added to the draft in America.
