true,[deleted],null,null,"Honestly ? Signal de Bougy is not what I would call romantic... Many children, amenities are 70's-ish, many families...

In roughly the same area, I would recommend Aubonne's Arboretum, a wonderful park in a nice valley full of vegetation.

The lake is a good idea ; I've recently been from Nyon to Yvoire (in France) with my gf and we were pleased.

One of the most beautiful villages in the vineyards is Rivaz ;

Gruyère is good, too, you can see the H R Giger :D the view is beautiful too and you will find the Swiss ""clichés"" condensed there.

Lausanne is magnificent, not far away from Lutry which offers cute walks along the lake. Going to Montreux with the train will allow you to watch a stunning view of the lake.

In Lausanne, I would recommend the Hermitage park and museum ; from there you will see the cathedral (visit it, too !) and the lake, and the place is easily reachable (bus 16 or by foot) and quiet.

In Lausanne too, there is Mon Repos park, which is beautiful and romantic ; you can eat an ice cream amongst the roses... You can easily walk from Hermitage to Mon Repos and cross the Cité. Go eat a crêpe in the 'Chandeleur' restaurant, it's lovely.

You can have a nice view of western Switzerland from Rochers de Naye ; there are marmots :D
