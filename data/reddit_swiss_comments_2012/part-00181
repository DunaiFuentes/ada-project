They deemed my high school diploma not adequate in comparison to their version of high school (gymnasium).

Life over there can be what you want. The night life can be awesome. Skiing is so much fun over there, hiking and biking too. However, many people I know that have been there find it a little boring because they had just come from Spain or Italy (places that might have more of that spice of life that people like and also a little more carefree) it allows for easy travelling to other countries. I love it there. Its clean, quiet, high quality of life, mostly very efficient and IMO pretty friendly in a lot of ways. Most of my family is there still so I get to visit a lot and might be a little biased. Oh...the weather can be a bummer if your used to or like a lot of sun.

The websites list that they only accept American High School diplomas along with 5 AP classes with at least a ""3"" score or 2 years of university to be worth to a gymnasium diploma.

I would assume if you don't meet the requirements you are not going to be accepted. It isn't easy. My sister (also swiss and went to a swiss school in Madrid, but did get into a Spanish Med school) didn't get into the Swiss medical schools. They are fairly selective. I didn't get into swiss unis, but was accepted to some pretty good schools in the US like Georgetown and University of North Carolina chap. Hill.
