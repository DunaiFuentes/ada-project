Swiss people are in general helpful, but like everywhere it is appreciated when foreigners are prepared. 

Quality of the Uni's: there isn't a huge difference between them, if you have the chance, then just visit a few and decide afterwards. 

Swiss people will understand you if you speak german, you might not understand them if you just started to study german. From my experiences you will get it after a few months and even if people always talk swiss german until asked to speak german, they can switch without major problems (also most swiss university student have a decent english). 

Economic outlook: Probably better than many other countries... Not brilliant though. 

Religiousness: Depends on where you will be living. In the cities religion is not a big thing, I think most people concider themselves atheist/agnostic or ""not thinking about that religion-thing too often"".

Universities are really cheap compared to the US and there isn't a big difference between universities (as for price). Our system is to provide everyone the same education and it's uncommon to make any depts during studying.

The University of St. Gallen (HSG) has a good reputation for Finance/Econ (http://www.unisg.ch/), for this university you pay roughly 2200.- USD each semester (http://www.unisg.ch/Studium/ZulassungUndAnmeldung/Gebuehren.aspx) as a foreign student

As for the language, there's a big difference between German and Swiss-German. Often Germans from the northern part of Germany have problems to understand us. Just learn some German first and ask them politely if they could speak in German or English. Everyone in the German speaking part can speak German and a lot of people already speak English very well. 

About the mentality: Usually the people are nice and helpful, maybe not always in the bigger cities because they are in a hurry. Most important point is to be polite and ask always (like dont start in German and expect them to answer in German, they will speak Swiss-German until you ask them to switch). Oh, be unboasfully ... the typical swiss citizen is unboasful and dislikes pretender (i.e. don't speak about the US as the best country or similar)

Religion: I'm not religious at all and i think there aren't a lot of strong religious people out there.

As stated in other responses, you might want to reformulate this question into a few more specific ones

&gt; Visas?

Again, google yourself a bit more knowledge, contact the [Swiss embassy in the US](http://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/home/reps/nameri/vusa/ref_visinf/visusa.html) and you get much more accurate answers than we can give you.

&gt; Employment outlook in Business: Finance/Econ for US citizens? 

Switzerland is relatively unaffected by the overall financial crisis, and depending on what you are looking for you find work in this specific field in all major cities, mostly in Zürich, Basel or Geneva. Look for jobs within the financial industry (banks, insurances) or large corporates like Novartis, Roche, Nestlé... 

Global banks like UBS and Credit Suisse offer also specific traineeships ( [i.e. UBS Graduate Trainee Program](http://www.ubs.com/global/en/about_ubs/careers/graduate_and_intern/switzerland/graduate_training_program.html) ) for graduates who want to start in the financial industry without previous working experience. Such a traineeship runs between 1-2 years and gives you a broad overview within banking.

&gt; Quality of Masters programs from public Uni's? 

Swiss unis are considered of a high standard, comparable to any other major university across the globe. You might want to google around a bit to find further info. www.swissuniversity.ch is a good start.

&gt; Degree of diff between German and Swiss-German? 

Swiss-Germans do understand German, vice versa not so much. However, it is recommended to learn German first and acquire any Swiss-German skills 'on the street'.

&gt; Objective, future economic outlook?

No major stumbling blocks expected for the coming 1-2 years. After that all bets are off... well, not all, we're still talking about Switzerland here. It will, for the foreseeable future, always be a good economy compared to countries surrounding us.

&gt; Religiousness...?

Switzerland is a very secular country and apart from a few quirks (in some areas companies have to pay church taxes without being able avoid it, even if the owner of the company is non-religious) there is little to no encounter of religious activities in your daily life. Should you want to foster your beliefs in a specific religious environment you should be able to find your circle of religious friends in all major cities (and universities for that instance).",0,1337701153,null,0,false,0,c4qzsrj,t3_txwpc,t1_c4qzsrj,t3_txwpc,null,1428976510,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
