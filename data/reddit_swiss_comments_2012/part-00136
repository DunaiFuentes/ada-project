Regarding the tap water, last time we were there we asked the waitress at least twice for tap water (plus the one when she took our order), the waitress always responded ""yes"", then she ignored us completely. Remarkable: we ordered also beer and coke, and a bottled gas-water; we received everything, less the tap water. It really looked like she did that on purpose. Very remarkable: all this happened twice. Since last time we decided to stop going there.

Some years ago it was considered the best meat with the best ""tartare"" restaurant in town. Reservation was obligatory to have a table on Friday/Saturday.

However the issue with bottled water goes deeper than simple math. Drinking bottled water is part of an entire mindset focused on disposable packaging around things which should be available in bulk free of packaging. Making this an issue of class is very important, and if people associate high end useless packaging to wealth they're going to drive a useless demand for it (see the stupid example of the Fiji water). There is (reportedly) a quote by Enrique Peñalosa’s “A developed country is not a place where the poor have cars; it’s where the rich use public transportation.” It's the same for water.
