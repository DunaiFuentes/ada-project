true,groie,lu,Luzern,"Good! Thanks :) Unfortunately my native tongue is Finnish, but English really isn't an issue for me. And I do truly hope to achieve at least some level of fluency in German in a few months.

Is climbing very common sport to do among Swiss people? How about klettersteig? We don't have any klettersteig in Finland and only very limited outdoor climbing facilities as well :(

I'll message you when I get settled :) I'm definitely down for some Aare bier :) Prost!",0,1331195047,null,0,false,0,c3yv8h2,t3_qk4zg,t1_c3yv8h2,t1_c3yusij,null,1428487940,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

As you know for sure, Mammut is a Swiss company, we all love:)  Maybe you want to have a look at http://gaswerk.kletterzentrum.com/home.php. One of the biggest Indoorcliming aereas in Europ i think.

Klettersteig wont be a problem as well. Maybe in the 90's but these days no problem anymore. So can enjoy all our Apls as often you want to. And its always lovley!

Great, when you know the beer already, maybe we should upgrade to Aarewasser:D (pretty sweet mixed shots awesome for party;) )",0,1331197777,null,0,false,0,c3yvgtz,t3_qk4zg,t1_c3yvgtz,t1_c3yv8h2,null,1428488061,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
