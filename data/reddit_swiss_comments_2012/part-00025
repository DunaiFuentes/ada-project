For a student the prices just keep getting hiked up and up and up, from about 100 a month (where your deductibles are so high you will end up paying for everything anyways) to 200 in a couple of months. That is the cheapest, too. I went to a doctor before work (paid everything, grr) and she was late by about 40 minutes. It's annoying.

I hate the fake kindness and their relationship to foreigners. The ads are just vomit-inducing. I work in an environment where there are about 2 Swiss people to 15 or so foreigners. It's an intellectually demanding job (PhD is pretty well a requirement), so clearly something is lacking in the Swiss population if they don't get hired as much. But oooh no ""More foreigners=fewer jobs"". Yes, you should complain some more.

And the high prices on meat. It doesn't even make sense. I can go across the border and buy it for 4 times cheaper. Ovomaltine is also about 4 times more here than it is in Germany.

Unlikely, it will probably be quite warm, Switzerland has cold winters and warm summers. There are a few places in Valais (Wallis) where it's high enough for there to be snow... Saas-Fee for one, you can do summer skiing there.

The law is that you can drink beer, wine and cider at age sixteen but most stores sell it only to eighteen year olds.

There is a big English speaking community in and around Zug due to several schools (e.g. the International School, Montana,...) and companies (e.g. Glencore or Johnson an Johnson). People in Zug are used to encounter the English language, yet you will propably face some difficulties with some Swiss when you approach them with English (some Swiss tend to be xenophobic towards other cultures and languages but appreciate it if someone tries to talk some German) but don't be afraid to ask for help or directions, not everybody's that close-minded.

There is not really something to experience in terms of nightlife in Zug. Most people go to Lucerne or Zurich. However, you will have a hard time to find a club or a bar to hang out when you're not eighteen.

If you're already in Zug make sure to go to Lucerne (30 min train ride, about $6) and especially this awesome [piece](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_Monument) of art.

Their predictions are hilariously wrong. For example, they wrote that the EUR/CHF floor was a futile attempt to prevent parity and wouldn't hold for long. Fact is, you'd have to be a complete idiot to speculate against a central bank that is committed to keep a floor.

On topic: This is nothing new. The SNB has been investing a part (around 10%) of its foreign-exchange reserves in a well-diversified equity portfolio since 2005. They don't invest in a few dubious corporations, they replicate broad market indices to capture market returns. The goal is NOT to attempt to profit from short-term price fluctuations. (Side note: They don't hold equity (or corporate bonds) in Swiss companies in order to avoid any conflict of interest with monetary policy.)

Why don't they invest in infrastructure? The National Bank Act doesn't allow them to do that for good reasons. Remember, the assets are bought with foreign-exchange reserves. The SNB needs to be able to liquidate these assets immediately. Last year's monetary interventions will lead to a surplus of CHF in circulation at some point in the future and that's when the SNB is going to buy back CHF in huge amounts very fast in order to prevent inflation.

For the beer/wine: As others have said, you can buy it, but the supermarkets generally won't sell it to you at 16 (Coop, definitely not; Denner, maybe; Migros doesn't sell alcohol, so don't bother).  You can buy beer and wine at almost any Tabac shop (all over the place in Geneve), and they probably won't have a problem selling to you.  They can't sell alcohol after 9pm, so stock up early!  You may get carded, if you look young, so carry some ID (I found a US drivers license is generally OK, but a passport is a better bet).

For going out: there are tons of bars in Geneva, but they are very expensive!  You should expect to pay CHF 7-9 for a beer, and more for a mixed drink.  There are several good Irish pubs (where English will be very common): Mr. Pickwick's, on Rue de Lausanne near the main station; Spring Brother's, on Grand Rue in Old Town; Lady Godiva, on Rue de Pont d'Arve in Plainpalais.  Bars shut at 2, and clubs are even more expensive (cover: CHF20, beers: CHF10, mixed drinks: CHF20), except for L'usine (www.lezoo.ch), which is in Jonction.  If you go there, keep your wits about you and try to go with a group, since its not the greatest area.

French:  You can get by with just English, but its definitely helpful if you have some French.  Just the basics will get you a long way, and I have found that people are a lot more willing to speak English if you ask them first in French whether they speak it.

Secondly, if you want to live in the ""German"" speaking part, you have to be aware of the fact that Schwiitzerdüütsch really is different than Hocheutsch. If you can already speak relatively well, than you may be able to learn quite easily, but if you are just are beginner, it will be difficult.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Lucky you! Since Switzerland is such a small country, in 15 days you can do much more than just visit it. You really can explore it!

So I don't recommend just a city or two. Instead of focussing on a couple of cities you really should explore the thing that makes Switzerland special: Its diversity. Board a train in middle-european-looking, almost-big-city-like, German-speaking Zurich – and three hours later you are in Lugano where people speak italien and which looks very italian. Or go in another direction – in two and a half hour you are at Lake Geneve where people speak French. To learn most about Switzerland you should go out and visit places in completely  different parts of the country !

The same advice goes for hiking. I think it's beautiful everywhere in the alps, so wherever you go you'll like it. But there are differences in the landscape and with the people, so don't just stay in Engadin or in Bernese Oberland but try and visit (at least!) both of it. Also try crossing the alps – start in German-speaking Switzerland, head south and after a day or two you arrive somewhere where people speak differently, the churches look different and the food is different, too!

One of the things that's the same almost everywhere in Switzerland is the beer. For reasons unknown most people get served and drink (!) Feldschlösschen (and also the usual imported brands). But cheer up, my friend: Exactly because of that in the last couple of years a lot of microbreweries were founded. So before you order your beer (or while you drink your first glass), look around and ask around if they have something local. 

And one more advice – just for the fun of it: If you have a spare day, try to visit Liechtenstein! It's only one and a half hours by train from Zurich, but it's a tiny country of its own. It's pretty fun to visit it and when you go home you can brag about it.",0,1330899093,null,0,false,0,c3xoax8,t3_qhfiv,t1_c3xoax8,t3_qhfiv,null,1428467133,5,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,5
