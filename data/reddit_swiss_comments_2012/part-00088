2. I don't discuss politics in Swiss forums, since it's mostly a circlejerking of either Neo-Nazi, foreign-hating, xenophobic bullshit or the quasi anarchist/communist mentality.

true,Hermel,null,null,"I once was a user of politnetz and even commented quite a bit. I was looking for insightful, inspiring discussions. But I couldn't find them. It looks to me that the quality of the posts is too low to interest me. The first current post is a good example that I dislike on my levels. It says: ""Sans-Papiers haben in der Schweiz einen schweren Stand ihre Anwesenheit gilt als illegal. Doch wie kann man als Person illegal sein?"".

* It is again the foreigner topic (this time from the left side), but I lost my interest in arguing here.
* ""nobody is illegal"" is a very old, obvious straw-man slogan. Why warming it up again? Nothing new.
* The first sentence even gives away that it is a straw-man argument. Nobody is claiming that these people are illegal. It is their presence in Switzerland that is illegal. It is a cheap rhetoric trick to raise emotions, but not the basis for a fruitful discussion.

The other posts are very similar: they are repetitions of well-known arguments by politicions who tend to repeat themselves and that see the platform as a place to profiling themselves instead as a source of inspiration. However, I don't think it is the platform's fault. It is politics that unfortunately often works this way.",0,1342241727,null,0,false,0,c5dtjzy,t3_wikq5,t1_c5dtjzy,t3_wikq5,null,1429372979,4,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,4
