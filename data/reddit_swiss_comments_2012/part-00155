A verbal agreement has exactly the same legal value as a written one. However it is not as easy to prove you've had that agreement. The letter you've received does count as evidence, if it really says "".. from now on ..."" because it implies that it didn't used to be that way.

If you are going to engage in a legal procedure, whoever signed the lease will have to pay the rent in the meantime. Do NOT pay the old rent if they already have paid for it, you are not legally required to do it and you would never get your money back. Ask the owner for the receipt of the previous rent as this counts as evidence as well. My advice: don't pay the previous rent, remide that guy of your agreement, tell him you are going to contact the Conciliation Commission (I don't know the german word for it.[ Here](http://ge.ch/justice/sites/default/files/justice/common/listes/Suisseallemande.pdf) is a phone list, but it may be a bit out of date.).
