true,istealreceipts,null,null,"Buying property in Switzerland is much more expensive than you'll expect. A moderately sized one or two bedroom apartment can be on sale for upwards of 2 million Swiss francs in canton Zurich, even more in Geneva. Swiss banks are also very responsible lenders, so you probably won't get that mortgage you're looking for.

In Switzerland, about 70% of people rent their homes and buying isn't really commonplace. [Homegate](http://www.homegate.ch) can give you an idea of rental prices by area.

You can look for work in Switzerland, preferably target firms and recruiters based in Switzerland. Please be aware that you will not be the first choice for a Swiss employer, as (in most EEA/EU countries) the employer must prove that the offered role could not be filled by a Swiss national and then they must jump through hoops and do a little dance before you can be considered for a role.

As for UN jobs, you'd have to think about moving to Geneva. All UN/NGO offices are in Geneva and as a foreigner (non-EU) your wife would have to be based in Geneva (this has something to do with the type of permit  issued and UN agreements with canton Geneva).

true,istealreceipts,null,null,"The commute to Geneva would be pretty brutal. The train ride is about 2.5-3h long. Another element you'd have to factor in is taxes. UN/NGO's have agreements set-up which allow their staff to be exempt from all Cantonal and Federal taxes, providing that you live in the Canton of Geneva. If your main residence is not in Geneva, your wife will be subject to tax in canton Zurich.

I won't go into property ownership and rules for foreigners as your mind will be blown by the protectionist (yet totally workable and sensible Swiss laws) set-up they have! My advice is: rent in Switzerland.

I totally understand the property market in NY. But you cannot comprehend how little you will get for 2 million Swiss francs. Apartments are already small in Switzerland and every square metre is at a premium.

All I can advise you is that the job market in Europe is exceptionally competitive. Employers are looking at unique skillsets and the candidate's right to work in that country. As you are not Swiss or EU, this puts you at an immediate disadvantage.

Regarding banking: you must build good credit with you bank and have a good relationship with a representative at your bank. If you have a bad bank rep or you piss them off, it will make banking difficult! Also, as a US citizen, you may have some problems opening a Swiss bank account (thanks to your government and their transparency laws). To make yourself appear as a responsible borrower, you just have to ensure that you have a regular salary. From there it's like anywhere else, just common sense banking; don't go overdrawn, always pay your credit card off in full etc.

true,Eskapismus,null,null,"Remember this: there is one answer for almost every question that relates to Switzerland. The answer is always: ""It depends on the canton"" Seriously, it's a lot worse than in the states. Switzerland is still a wannabe confederation consisting of 26 cantons. In most cases with different laws etc. 

So every canton has different tax laws. This means that right next to Zurich there is for example the canton of Schwyz. It is small and back in the day no foreigner would consider moving there ecxept for people who like the nice view over the lake. Well then Schwyz lowered the taxes to almost nothing and suddenly they got flooded with rich foreigners. So all the CEO types now live in Schwyz and work in Zurich which is only a 30 min ride by car. 

Another aspect is the lump sum taxation. So if you are rich enough, basically you get taxed on the standard of living you chose - meaning they look at the rent you pay and some other factors and that is then the tax basis meaning you won't get taxed at your other income from whatever source. I think deemed income has to be around 200k a year so together with your wife this might be possible for you. However lump sum taxation was abolished in Canton of Zurich last year by a popular vote. It still exists in many other cantons though. 

One other thing that might be of interest to you is the so called holding privilege. This means that non-operative holding companies are not taxed on capital gains but only on their ... don't know whtat the right term in english is... let's just say on the assets. In canton Zug for example this is rediculously low (like 0.002 promille or something). I am just saying this because for a guy who is in mergers and acquisitions there is always work in Switzerland. 

Maybe call Glencore and ask if they need a guy like you

edit: I forgot to mention, taxes inside the cantons vary as well, so even inside Zurich there are many different municipalities with very low taxes.
