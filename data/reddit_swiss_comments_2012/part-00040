true,TotalSinnlos,null,null,"Not meaning to sound arrogant, but almost every FHS (and uni) here in Switzerland is respectable, so is the FHS St. Gallen. As far as I know, there isn't a student discount on public transport. You can get a Halbtax-card which will enable you to buy tickets for half the price (it costs something around 200 CHF if I recall correctly, depending on the duration of its validity). Switzerland is expensive and you will pay an arm and a leg, I wish it were different. But you can make it less of a pain if you share a flat and buy cheap products (there are product lines of the 2 big grocery chains here (Migros and Coop) that are extra cheap, they are called M-Budget and Prix Garantie).

Hope I could help you out a little.",0,1333913653,null,0,false,0,c49wgd3,t3_rzeam,t1_c49wgd3,t3_rzeam,null,1435723191,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
