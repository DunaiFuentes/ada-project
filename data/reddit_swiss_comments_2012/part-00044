As a Swiss entrepreneur in the US, I always wonder if there are more opportunities in Switzerland, but I think it's simply a different economic environment to deal with. I think there are certain traits a US entrepreneur could be very successful with, others less. Service and responsiveness can be improved in many areas, but quality is something the Swiss customer expects and demands with little tolerance. In a small market you often can't afford to fail to deliver and move on without repercussions. 
Apart from some small ventures in college, I never did business on my own Switzerland, so my views from across the pond might be skewed. All in all I think it's a very good, but fairly limited market, so it really depends on what you want to do.

This is not the actual problem, but more like a symptom of it. The actual problem is that there are plenty of well-paying jobs available so that the opportunity costs of entrepreneurship are higher. In other countries, the alternative to entrepreneurship often is a shitty job with a low wage. In Switzerland, the alternative to entrepreneurship is a great job with an excellent salary. You see how the incentives are different?
