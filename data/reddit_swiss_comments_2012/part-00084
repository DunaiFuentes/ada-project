Hiking: Valais is great for that ([ref](http://www.valais.ch/en/index.cfm)) but [Bernese Oberland](http://www.myswitzerland.com/en/bernese-oberland1.html) too. My personal favorite is [Girons](http://www.everytrail.com/browse.php?activity_id=5&amp;country=Switzerland&amp;state=Grisons). Be aware though: A hiking trail considered as ""rather easy"" in Switzerland would probably be classified as ""dangerous"" in US. For long hikes you definitively need some good hiking shoos. 

Tech stuff: I'm sure you find something interesting in the [Transportation museum in Lucerne](http://www.verkehrshaus.ch/index.cfm?dom=4).

Swiming: If you're a good swimmer, try out swimming in the Aar river in Bern. But you should go with someone who knows the place ([ref](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-10893835))...
