true,telllos,vd,Vaud,"I think the language is really important, If you're not fluent enough it will be hard to work in the medical field.

I think Switzerland lack doctor and nurses, that's the reason why lots of Nurses come from France I the western part of Switzerland. There is a demand for qualified people and not enough Swiss to do the job.

So the language you will know will determine in which part to move to.

If you want to perfect your Italian, know that ticino is a beautiful region that shouldn't be toiled out for being small.

I can't tell you anything about guns.

I know how hard it is for us citizens to take holidays, but have you considered visiting the countries of you choice beforehand?

Also If you are from a very warm state, think about coming in spring, arriving in winter would be harder to adjust. ",0,1331455316,null,0,false,0,c3ztr69,t3_qr5rj,t1_c3ztr69,t3_qr5rj,null,1428504544,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

true,Toradreo,null,null,"Swiss here, I'll try to answer those questions.

1) The italian-speaking part of Switzerland is the Ticino (1 of 26 cantons). French is spoken in western Switzerland and the rest is mostly (swiss-)german-speaking. There are some french-german bilingual towns but no italian-german bilingual towns, however most people in Ticino understand german, they just don't like to speak it. While most of the Swiss understand english it is highly recommended to speak at least the local language halfway fluently if you want to find a job.

2) If I understand this correctly you could work as a nurse, which is quite lucky for you because this is a field that already has a large part of foreigners working there so they are used to employ non-swiss people. As a nurse you would probably earn around $6,000 a month. Your wife would probably earn about the same (or a lot more with a university degree).

3) I can only speak for Swiss here, don't know about foreigners: Buying and possessing a gun is quite easy (i.e. getting the permit to buy one is easy), carrying it in public (other than shooting ranges) is almost impossible if your job doesn't require it. I guess you could join a local shooting club and then it wouldn't be a big problem shooting your weapon there but other than on your way from your home to the shooting range you can't carry your weapon. But there is no need for it, criminal rates are far lower in Switzerland (or whole europe for that matter) than in the US =P

4) I have no idea how much it costs to completely move to another country but I guess once settled in you can live with $40,000 and a middleclass job. You can get a feeling for the costs of living in Switzerland [here](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=Switzerland&amp;city=Zurich&amp;displayCurrency=USD) (those are the costs for Zurich which is a rather expensive city.)",0,1331460868,null,0,false,0,c3zu4z0,t3_qr5rj,t1_c3zu4z0,t3_qr5rj,null,1428504719,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3
true,archerx,vd,Vaud,"1. The Swiss Italians don't speak as much english as the rest in my experience, the Swiss French and Germans will probably speak english if that's important to you. However if you move to the German part you will be learning a language and a half, High German + Swiss German.

2. There should be a bit of deman in the medical field due to the aging population so you have good chances of finding a job, if you're lucky you can find a job where you deal with english speakers that prefer english speaking doctors, there are a lot of ex pats here!

3. It's not what you think where people walk around with guns, if you do that in the city you will get a lot of looks unless you're wearing a military uniform. Sure most people have a gun here but it's mostly locked away in the basement till military service. There are gun ranges but people just rent a gun and don't bring their own. The rural areas might be different though but I wouldn't want to live there.

4. A nest egg will be important especially when finding a place to live, the deposit is about 3 months rent. Food can be cheap if you're smart about your shopping. Fruits are always on sale and the M-budget stuff is pretty good. If you get a decent job then you should be sweet if you budget for everything. You'll have to pay for health insurance because it's mandatory and taxes are not automatically deducted from your pay so you have to set aside some money for tax time.

Good Luck.

true,Spucknapf,bl,Basel-Landschaft,"So unique and tellos, allready said the most important I think. Just a few things I want to point out.

- Dont expect you will be allowed to carry guns here! NEVER EVER! I saw at /edc there are many people that carry guns in the US. This wont happen here. Even if your at a ""range"" or in a Club that wont be enought to carry guns in dayly bussines. And to be honest, there is absolutley no need for it, ecxept you are a Cop or Bodyguard or something like this, you won't get the permit for it. So yes, you can go shooting at a range, but be prepared, that it will be completley diffrent than in the US. For example you won't see here any special calibers or weapons like its common in the US. What you see on the ranges are Sigs which are from military service and Pistols who are in the cathegory ""Ordonanzwaffen"". Its pretty seroius handled here! So best will be, you check that with the consulate.

- Not that sure about your 40k banc. Most of us are very discreet about money and earnings. But Ill give you a imagination. You can expect, that the normal job with some experience is about a year salary I'd say of 80k swiss Franks! An Appartement in the City lets say 3.5 rooms will cost you about 1500 swiss Fanks a Month. Youll pay less, if your not going direct in the city, what will be pretty no big deal for you. My experience with Americans is, that the Swiss is so smal, and you are familar to travel an hour or two. For us, thats kinda big deal. Health care in Switzerland is a MUST by law! Expect 300-400 a month. I know that will scare you, but the system is not near as scary as you have in the US, its prety worth it!

So what I would do, if I'd be you is following.

- Check out that at least one of you, has a garanteed Job here, before you move over. You can arrange that from US. Then it won't be a problem to get a resinstance permit as well.
- Lets say one of you found a job. Check where its located and what language is spoken there. An that language you will need to learn. Simple said, west is France, south is Italian and the rest is German. So most likley you will have to learn german!
- Don't expect your english will be enought. Yes, most of us can speak english, but most of us won't be happy to have a colleague, which only speaks english. So it will make things a lot easyier when you learn the local language, and you gain a pluspoint from the locals for it. If your willing, youll get a lot of assistance.
- Get all the paperwork done you can from the US!

true,Hermel,null,null,"1) It is though getting a job if you don't speak German in the German part or French in the French part.

2 &amp; 4) The job is key. 40'000$ does not get you that far. Your first priority should be finding a job, which is hard without European passport. Swiss law makes it easy to hire EU-citizens, but the number of **work-permit**s for other countries is strictly limited. So even if you find a job, your company will have to overcome cumbersome bureaucratic barriers in order to get a work permit for you. This can take weeks or even months. Chances of getting the permit are much higher in the beginning of the year, as long as there are some left. Being highly qualified helps here, but even companies like Google have difficulties getting the necessary permits for their employees. I can give you the address of a nurse that moved from Germany to Switzerland (pm me). She might know more about your specific field. But at first sight, it looks to me like your wife has better chances of getting a job. As electrical engineer, should could apply at ABB, which is a huge international corporation based in Switzerland. She could even try getting a job at [ABB](http://www.abb.com) in the US first and then moving to Switzerland within the company. In fact, that might be the smoothest and lowest-risk plan. They have an excellent trainee program that takes one year and during which you get to see multiple countries, but you need to be good to get in there. ABB currently lists [almost 2000](http://www.abb.com/cawp/abbzh253/ec5bc3eea21af278c125787f004679e7.aspx) open positions on their web page.

Btw: nobody cares about credit scores in Switzerland. Also, credit cards are rarely used. Normally, people use cash or debit cards. The closest equivalent to the **credit score** in Switzerland is the so-called ""Betreibungsregisterauszug"". It is a paper that confirms that you have never been prosecuted for not paying a bill.

The real benefit of course is the compounding effect - every person of low income who does manage to save and buy a home after 10 years is now in a much stronger financial position, and so are their immediate familly.

Instinct would suggest that as you go up the income scale from the lowest to the highest the benefit would increase, however since the saving limit is 15,000 CHF/year and it is only applicable to the first home purchase of an individual, I believe the added benefit actually shrinks as you go up the income scale. i.e. If I'm earning +150,000 CHF/year it is more likely that I already own a home and thus don't benefit at all from the initiative.

Let me jump to some conclusions too. You must be a believer in free markets. I used to think along this lines too, I studied economics. Markets don't work when there are market failures like externalities, public goods and anticompetitive behavior. In the real world these kinds of failures are everywhere. For example the fact that an ebook can be reproduced at no cost makes the whole thing a single market failure. Then there are public goods like cultural diversity. Then there is anticompetitive behavior from big publishers which collude with big distributors. The free market ideology is based on a theory that does not apply here.
