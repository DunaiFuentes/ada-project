Well, federalism is a direct opposite to centralism. In a direct democratic country that is organized centralisticly, the people can only elect countrywide officials and vote for countrywide affairs in contrast to federal organized countries where districts/counties (kantons in Switzerland) have sovereign power of local affairs not afflicting the nations constitution.

So technically, in a federal organized republic and/or democracy you can not only elect nationwide officials or vote for nationwide concerns you can also vote for statewide(kanton), in Switzerland even City/Town wide stuff and elect local officials.

One good route is Faulhorn to Bussalp and finally to Grindelwald with a toboggan. It's about two hours uphill and a long long 15 km ride back to Grindelwald. No beacon needed there.

But maybe snowshoe walking is more to your taste. For that you will probably need to join a guided tour because then you better have a beacon and a guide. Rescue insurance may be included.
