true,p4nny,null,null,"Hi, I was exactly in the same situation last year (also M.Sc. in CS at EPFL by the way). If you applied for FMEL you might get a place for the next year, just to know; so you might need a place just for one year.

If you can't find anything till August and if it's not too expensive for you, come to Lausanne and search for accommodation; it's a good idea to go personally and visit some places. A good starting point for establishing some contacts is the website EPFL offers for this kind of stuff. Also, don't be afraid to lease something outside Lausanne/ Ecublens/ Renens. If you come in August you can also follow the French courses offered by EPFL; still, the student hostels are not very cheap.

Apart from this, I can't help you very much regarding this issue. I got lucky and found a friend of a friend that had a free place in a shared apartment. 600 CHF per month is reasonable, I pay 500 but it is not close to EPFL.

true,pipaparapo,null,null,"My thoughts on this:

* If you rent one you won't need to pay any road tax because there already will be a sticker (aka tax mark aka *Autobahnvignette*) on the wind shield.

* Don't know the prices exactly, but I suppose it's not cheap. Public transport is extraordinary in Switzerland; comfortable, on time, connected. You'll be much quicker out of town and at your destination. You'd save a lot of time by catching a train straight forward instead of getting to the car park, getting out of town, searching parking spaces.

* However, I understand the fun of those roads (how about a motorbike, if you know riding?). Parking space is—when out of town!—mostly not a problem. Don't forget tickets (e.g. speeding) are pretty expensive.

* If you're more into driving than hiking with the occasional (and stunning) view, a round trip is absolutely possible. Start your tour to the SE of Zurich, heading to Davos (Flüelapass is nice), eventually crossing Italy to the SW, maybe come back over the Gotthard pass and continue via Lucerne to Zurich. If you're more into hiking forget the car and hop on a train. You'll get the view anyways.",0,1339884252,null,0,false,0,c51iwn2,t3_v5j9l,t1_c51iwn2,t3_v5j9l,null,1429159235,4,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,4

In my experience the train is (slightly) cheaper up until about 2 hours trip length, but this is assuming you have a cheap rental - he probably won't have a Mobility card or similar.
