true,DeepBlueNemesis,bs,Beide Basel,"I think this initiative has a good basic idea but it will fail in reality, simply because it will change so much in our society and especially the job market. 

For example, how will the salaries change? Let's face it, 2.5k/month is juust enough to get by, but not enough to lead a decent life where you have your own apartment, a car, go on vacations every now and then etc etc. Which means you will have to work at least partially. Now, if you are an employer, how much will you pay your employees? Salary is the result of supply and demand - it pays enough so the employee does a good job but it doesn't pay more than necessary, which would result in excess spending from the employer (on the employee), hurting the company in the long run. 

After the change, where are supply and demand? In an ideal world the salary would be the same and two people would work 50% on the same job. What is most likely going to happen though is that most salaries will simply be lowered by approximately the 2000-2500 CHF (with some exceptions, mainly those low-paying-but-essential jobs in garbage disposal, construction and hospitals where the cuts aren't going to be so severe so people aren't like ""naww I'd rather lead a simple life than break my back"").

Another likely scenario would be inflation. Everyone has more money -&gt; everything will become more expensive. Basic economics. 

There are benefits to this, of course, but in my opinion they either aren't going to last very long are do not outweight the drawbacks. By the way I do not believe that this initiative will pass if it comes to vote, a couple of months back we shot down an initiative that would have granted us all more vacation, Swiss people are fond of working..",0,1338885647,null,0,false,0,c4whjh0,t3_ukczy,t1_c4whjh0,t3_ukczy,null,1429072012,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

true,Godspiral,null,null,"thoughtful ideas, but I disagree with:

&gt; There are benefits to this, of course, but in my opinion they either aren't going to last very long are do not outweight the drawbacks.

First, though there might be inflation, it would not outweigh the benefits of more overall wealth being spent.  Only fixed supply goods prices like property and resources are directly affected by growth in money and wealth.  Consumer goods spending remains competitive, and companies tend to prefer attracting more sales than raising prices.

Your comment on what might happen to wages are quite thoughtful.  I agree that there would be an initial downward pressure on wages, but there are many counterbalancing factors involved:

* if wages paid by employers are lower, it makes Swiss made goods more competitive, and so creates/needs more jobs --&gt; higher wages
* There is no longer need for mandated vacation time, if people start to prefer working part time. -&gt;  Need for more people at higher wages for more work hours.
* Some people will choose to drop out of labour force.  -&gt; Higher wages from increase bargaining position of those who want to work.

One of the major benefits of social dividends over basic income, is that it is a variable benefit that goes up and down with the health of the economy.  You no longer need inflexible labour regulations, that can prolong unemployment in difficult times, because people have the option to refuse work, but the amount of the subsidy going down in harsher times, might give them extra incentive to work more hours.",0,1338901762,null,0,false,0,c4wj0v8,t3_ukczy,t1_c4wj0v8,t1_c4whjh0,null,1429072698,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
