Like them, I am indifferent to what it says about Switzerland. I was surprised to hear later that someone felt offended. Now that you asked I started watching the video, but boredom forced me to stop before the end. This video is lying about Romney, not Switzerland.

The swiss banking secret helps foreigners escape taxes. In recent years swiss bankers have been caught illegally courting clients in the US. If swiss bank accounts have a bad reputation now, it's not because of some american video.
