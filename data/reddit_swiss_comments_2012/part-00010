This was a couple of years ago, however. I haven't tried it lately (last time maybe 1-2 years ago). Other than that, it'll be a bit hard. Bildwerk Bern - which is quite a big lab in Bern - does it, and maybe there are shops in Geneva that ship it there. The same is probably true for Photo Studio 13 in Zürich. Those two labs are not too cheap though (Bildwerk Bern: ""amateur quality"" is 4.95 for developing, 0.50 for Eco 9 by 13 prints). Lastly, there might still be shops that have an own Minilab, but I think they get rarer. Now there, it's tricky to find a good operator. Crossing roughly 10% of the films doesn't affect the quality of other films, still, some operators think it ruins the chemistry when they run a slide film in the C-41 process.

Best thing is probably to try with Migros. Just put ""Cross, C-41"" for slide films in the special remarks field. It always worked for me.


Edit: About print quality: Bildwerk Bern, being one of the best labs in my opinion, has a digital step in their analog enlarging process, and when they started that, I was upset, because there was - in my opinion - a drop in quality.

First, the guns here are only given to swiss citizens in age of military. You give it back at around 30, when you're done with your military duties. Most cantons here have now voted laws that makes that the guns are no more kept at home, but kept in the military offices and given only when the soldiers are on duty. 

Those laws were adopted because there has been a lot of death caused by this stupid and outdated (in my opinion) law to keep guns at home. Mostly accidents and suicides.
