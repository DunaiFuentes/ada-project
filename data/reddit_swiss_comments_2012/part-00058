I do not live in Lugano but in Zurich. I'll give you my opinion anyway: Lugano is very much a small town.

 It's very nice, in a scenic sort of way, and I think you can pick up Italian reasonably quickly with a bit of an effort (if you speak any Spanish it will help), but I think I would get bord and I am not a 24hr-party-people guy.

Milan is 1 to 2 hours away by train, so it's quite feasible to go there. For nights out you could just get a hotel room or take the first train back.",0,1337257703,null,0,false,0,c4p3mgq,t3_trhu7,t1_c4p3mgq,t3_trhu7,null,1428943280,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

if you download games, software etc. you make yourself punishable.

in most, or all p2p networks (?) you're going to upload stuff while downloading, if you don't allow these programs to upload, you're fine...
