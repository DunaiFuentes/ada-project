true,[deleted],null,null,"Airline tickets especially during the summer are going to be expensive. Well, depending on your definition of expensive I suppose. Anyway. I've flown back and forth between the US and Switzerland several times and this is my experience: 

Swiss Air is very nice. I flew direct from San Francisco to Zurich and it was pretty spendy but definitely worth it imo. It's very nice to not have to worry about changing planes or anything like that, and the airline itself is very friendly and had great service in my experience. The plane I flew on was very comfortable. You can expect somewhere in the range of $1-2k for one adult ticket for this particular sort of flight though depending on when you travel and where you are coming from. 

Other airways are less expensive but then you have to deal with changing planes and stuff. I have flown on the cheaper airlines and while they are less expensive it can be more of a hassle. For example I flew once from SF to Zurich with a stop in both Philadelphia and Paris on the way. My Philly flight was about 2 hours late getting off the ground which meant that when I landed in Paris I had less than 30 minutes to get off the plane and find my connecting flight. I barely made it in time and it was extremely stressful! Bleh. So my recommendation is to spend the bit of extra money and just fly direct if you can. 

Everything is expensive here in comparison to the US (which is where I am assuming you are from). All I can really comment on from personal experience is food and eating out. It's really expensive. A meal you could get for like 5 bucks at a McDonald's in the US is about twice that much here, to give you an idea. However there are a lot of these little cafe-type restaurants that sell kebabs and sandwiches and stuff that aren't terribly expensive- I recommend eating at those. The big grocery stores (Migros, Coop, Denner to name a few) also sell premade sandwiches and little things of pasta or fruit or salad. There's also a lot of bakeries everywhere and they are a good choice to eat at as well. 

Besides the financial stuff...as for Switzerland itself, it's indeed quite a beautiful country here! Really, anywhere you go, it's pretty. There are tourist-y places that are very nice and beautiful like Interlaken and such. There's a lot of hiking all over the place and the scenery is spectacular. My favorite place that I've been to so far is a place called Lenk- you can look it up if you want, it's quite beautiful!
