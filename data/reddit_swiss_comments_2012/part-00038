true,Vlip,be,Bern,"Well, don't knock on Bière as long as you haven't seen the other places.
Next to Bure, Bière is a palacio and a joy to be in. Also keep in mind that you will spend quite a few WKs in stinky overcrowded civil protection bunkers so enjoy Bière while it lasts ;)

As an artillerist your WKs will either be Bière (oh joy), Bure (oh god kill me now) or Simplon (enjoy the bunker life).
We used to go to Frauenfeld which had a nicer modern quarters with a closer bigger city to spend the evening in but those days are gone.

true,DeepBlueNemesis,bs,Beide Basel,"Only 60 years? I was on the Gotthardpass, the Motto Bartola to be more exact, which was built in 1860, and by ""built"" I mean ""hacked into the mountain"". Cold, narrow, dark, damp, and snow until June. But as Vlip said, even that was paradise compared to some places you will spend your WKs (like bunkers who aren't good enough to hold asylum seekers). 

Anyway, enjoy your time. I know you will not in the slightest, but you will always look back fondly and like to talk about it afterwards (to the horror of most women around you) ;)",0,1333528637,null,0,false,0,c48bjop,t3_ro0dl,t1_c48bjop,t1_c480ny0,null,1428652770,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3

Heh, I think I've bored way too many women to death with talks about my army time but imho that's the price they get to pay to go on sabbaticals in some warm foreign land while the men get to crawl in damp mud ;)",0,1333537553,null,0,false,0,c48c5h3,t3_ro0dl,t1_c48c5h3,t1_c48bjop,null,1428653056,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3
