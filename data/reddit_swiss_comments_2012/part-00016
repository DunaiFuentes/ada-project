It is in its function there so that the general population keeps training the gun. Best thing? make it a festival ... but it has to be the gun that the military is using.  I started shooting, with the SIG510, when I was 16 years old. By the time you are actually joining up in the military, you already know your way around that gun. It's a trick. A fun trick though.

Here is what you should try. Go to a shooting festival. Explain yourself to the guy that is running the thing.
Tell him, you are willing to pay for the ammo (and a beer for the owner or two) if someone would let you shoot on their rifle. Maybe you will have to deposit the ID/Passport for the time being .. dunno. But if they don't get the creepy-crawly vibes from you, this should not be a problem.
