If so it is totally worth it to purchase a half fare and Gleis 7 card.  For one year it was something like 400 franks or less, not sure if you can get half year cards.

So it only takes 16 hours of travel after 7pm, or 32 hours of travel before 7pm to make it worthwhile throughout the year.  This isn't exact, just a ballpark of how quickly I found these cards pay back.
