I have found it on occasion at the Asian food shop in the HB. It isn't always there and doesn't always look too great. Their tofu, though, is great, especially if you are buying tofu at migro or coop. If they don't have any (look in the refrigerated section on the left on the back wall), just ask - they are really helpful.",0,1332527493,null,0,false,0,c446u3n,t3_ra2ke,t1_c446u3n,t3_ra2ke,null,1428580776,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

The town is very close to Lausanne, so lots of people work in Lausanne and live in Yverdon (much cheapper).",0,1332536456,null,0,false,0,c448o6r,t3_r8gi1,t1_c448o6r,t1_c43rdwb,null,1428581642,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3
