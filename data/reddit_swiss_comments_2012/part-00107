If someone wants to try and learn a language the worst possible thing to say is to not bother trying. All that does is make a group of people seem very exclusive and shut off from the rest of the world which will lead to their special dialect eventually dying out.

I myself am learning swiss german currently due to becoming involved with a native schweizerin.  I speak german pretty well and it's been tough to even convince myself that I'd even want to learn it, but as a language lover I can't resist the challenge.
