true,atlantic,world,bahamas,"&gt; will be not only a hassle, but extremely expensive

Parking is always an issue in Switzerland, but rarely expensive and a hassle. It's either no hassle and very expensive or a hassle only, because there is simply not enough street parking or parking where you can park long enough. Parking garages, especially in premium locations are very expensive and can be full at certain times of the day. 
So if money is not such a big consideration, you can get around in a car, especially in the countryside, but public transport is always a good alternative if you don't mind the fact that it's public...",0,1333128771,null,0,false,0,c46paki,t3_rl64b,t1_c46paki,t3_rl64b,null,1428624683,5,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,5
true,Tarlitz,null,null,"Never had a problem parking the car in Z端rich. Yeah, parking in the center is a little expensive, but isn't it in every major city?

That said, I'm not sure if going by train is much cheaper.

It's very easy to get around by train and public transport and there are all kinds of arrangements you can take advantage of as a tourist for traveling around. Besides that, the trains can take you through some beautiful landscapes and are very comfortable!",0,1333128889,null,0,false,0,c46pbg0,t3_rl64b,t1_c46pbg0,t3_rl64b,null,1428624700,0,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,0
true,DeepDuh,zh,Z端rich,"1) absolutely, good idea.
 
2) Interlaken is relatively easy to park. Lucerne is ok, there is a free one a bit outside at the lakeside near the  'Verkehrshaus' (museum of technology). Berne is harder IMO but I personally have never tried it. I'd look for a park&amp;ride parking there and go to the centre by train. Warning: Even those parkings are probably way more expensive than what you're used to. About 3chf per hour is probably standard.

But, I am hoping that by driving, we can actually stop along the way, anywhere we like.

if you're looking for a lower cost solution, especially if you're travelling alone: ditch the car altogether and get a swiss pass - a general ticket for all of public transport (including even many mountain trains) for a fixed fare.

if you're travelling in a group, a car is a good option again - with some planning ahead you should also be able to find less expensive parking a bit outside of the cities. ",0,1333135315,null,0,false,0,c46qod2,t3_rl64b,t1_c46qod2,t1_c46pgl1,null,1428625331,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

Looks like Interlaken has free parking, so I should check on Zurich and Geneva. Mind you I'd assume something closer to the city core would have issue with parking, but less reason to need a car.

See the thing is that most medieval cities of the german / alemannic culture have been bombed to the ground in ww2 - except in Switzerland. So this is one of the best places to still see medieval cities. Berne is especially impressive IMO.
