2. The fake movie wasn't named after the airplane, but the airplane really had the name ""Aargau"". 

3. But the fact that the plane that rescued the diplomatic personnel was named ""Aargau"", which sounds to english speaking people like ""Argo"" had to be kind of funny to the CIA-agents due to the fact that the fake movie and their mission were named ""Argo"".

Again: I'm sorry for making so much and such big mistakes, I really don't want to spread wrong information and hope I corrected all my faults. If not, please write other faults here. In future I will do more research and think more before posting something on reddit.

I'm finishing up my MSc at ETHZ and went all-out on a job search earlier this year. There's an initiative out there that says that a non-EU/CH who graduates from a Swiss university should be ""on equal footing"" as EU/CH. http://www.bfm.admin.ch/content/bfm/en/home/themen/arbeit/nicht-eu_efta-angehoerige/hochschulabgaenger.html

I have had two companies interview me and invite me for a second interview. After the interview was scheduled, HR gets back to me and tells me that since I'm non-EU/CH, they're not interested anymore. I even contacted Neirynck (the professor who pushed for the afore-mentioned initiative) himself. He wrote me back saying that many companies just choose to ignore this avenue towards a work permit because it involves some extra paperwork.  

I have since spent less time trying to find a job in Switzerland. It's just so frustrating to be told that you're qualified but since you don't have the correct citizenship, you should get lost.
