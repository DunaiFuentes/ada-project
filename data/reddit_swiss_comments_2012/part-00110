true,DeepDuh,zh,Zürich,"1) Google Swiss Pass. Should cover your local transport expenses for relatively cheap. Public transport in Switzerland is among the best, you can pretty much bet on it. 

2) skyride thingy.. no idea what you mean honestly. There are lots of aerial lifts in Switzerland. The best snowy mountain sceneries you can get are in Wallis, Bernese Alps and Graubünden. 

3) My recommendation for a 3 day alp tour:
zurich -&gt; lucerne (spend a few hours for sight seeing) -&gt; interlaken -&gt; grindelwald (go to ""kleine scheidegg"" or to Jungfrau top of europe -&gt; zermatt(more expensive) -&gt; montreux (spend some time at lake geneva, maybe also at the french side) -&gt; from there go back towards the more populated areas.

4) cheap food: Try Kebab, they're often quite good in Switzerland. Local markets: Even small towns usually have a ""Migros"" or ""Coop"". They're not the cheapest super markets but they have decent quality and it's much cheaper than restaurants. When the weather is right it's very nice to eat somewhere outside, preferably at one of the many lakesides you will encounter.

5) Fancy restaurants: Zurich has the most choices but watch out for high prices. Lausanne, Berne and Lucerne have some pretty good restaurants as well and it's a bit cheaper (but still way way more expensive than the States). Some of my recommendations: 

- Pulcino, Italian, Zurich, $30 per person with drinks
- Waldheim, fancy french food, Zug, $80-90 per person with drinks
- Lapin, Swiss food, Lucerne, $40-50 per person with drinks

6) As for towns I highly recommend to visit Berne, it has the most remarkable scenery IMO. On your way back from lake geneva you could also make a detour to Gruyere.",0,1345560768,null,0,false,0,c5wi5sh,t3_ykwx2,t1_c5wi5sh,t3_ykwx2,null,1429696729,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3

true,qvantamon,null,null,"A few tips:
Public transport is top notch. Driving and parking in Zurich is unpleasant. Don't think about a car unless you really know what you're doing.

Everything closes on nights and Sundays. I mean it. Plan around it.

Shopping is gonna be expensive and crowded. Aside from chocolate, just do some window shopping in Bahnhofstrasse. For chocolate, go to confisserie sprüngli and go nuts.

The only cheap food is kebab or McDonalds. I'd go with kebab.

If you've got the time, go to the ""travel agency"" at the major train stations  and let them know your plans. There's a lot of confusing passes and fare discounts for the train system, and you can easily save a couple hundred by optimizing here. Plus, the machines are not the friendliest if you don't already know what you're looking for. Use Google Maps and the SBB site/app to plan your routes.

Watch where you enter on trains. Trains have a ""1"" or ""2"" near the door and near the seating areas, meaning first or second class. You'll usually buy second class tickets (1st class isn't worth it), so make sure you sit in the right class.

Plan on using more cash than in the US. Credit Cards are less used, and crime is pretty much Zero, so I usually walk around with like 200-500 francs in my wallet. Also, fucking coins everywhere - coins go up to 5chf, and bills start at 10chf, and 5chf coins are fucking huge.

Everyone speaks English, and they're not snooty about it like the French can be. I've gotten lazy, and often just speak English to people, without even asking first if they speak it. They usually don't mind.

A nice meal will cost ~50 chf. A kebab around 15. If you use the right passes, plan to spend 50-100chf on transport per person per day.",0,1345569420,null,0,false,0,c5wkhog,t3_ykwx2,t1_c5wkhog,t3_ykwx2,null,1429697882,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

As for credit cards, they're generally accepted, just not used as much. I can't really say why, but I end up using much more cash in here, compared to the US. The train stations and fancy restaurants will certainly accept credit cards.

Edit: You can do a day trip to Zermatt, but keep in mind it's a a bit over 3 hours each way. You might be better off staying a day or two in Bern instead (which is about 1-1.5h closer to Zermatt, and has its own sights to see).
