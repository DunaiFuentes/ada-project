true,DeepDuh,zh,Zürich,"Have managers of the SBB ever looked at how things are done in Tokyo? Of course, it's another dimension (&gt;30 times bigger than Zurich), but I feel that some of the things they do could be interesting for Switzerland. I feel that Japan is maybe the only country with an even higher quality train system than Switzerland. Here are some examples: 

1) Trains stop exactly at the right markings, usually with +- 0.5m tolerance (usually still done manually by the driver!). This allows them to paint markings for the doors at the platforms. This again, allows people to form nice queues where the doors will arrive and they leave enough space for the people who need to exit. It's something I often miss at the S-Bahn in Zurich, the in/out is often a bit of a mess. 

2) There are posters showing which sector is best for which exit at each train stop. I could post pictures of that if you want. Very helpful in places as crowded as some of the Tokyo stations, but I feel it could also be helpful in Switzerland for non-locals who don't know the layout of each station yet. Supposedly it was a housewife from Tokyo who came up with these posters and they got adopted. 

3) The ticketing system: All I need to do is to scan a pre-charged electronic card at the entrance / exit of the train lines. The cards use near field communication - I don't even have to take it out of my purse - similar to our ski resorts. The scanners can check/allow passage very rapidly, each line can put through more than one person per second. This would probably be the most expensive to adopt and it's probably not as important in Switzerland with our great yearly subscriptions (which they don't have in Japan), but I still find it a very interesting system and an example for efficiency when you have to optimize for throughput of people in your stations (something that might become necessary at some point in areas of growth like Geneva and Zurich). 

Edit: I wanted to add that I'm still happy with the train system in Switzerland and I'd like to thank you for what you guys are doing. But there is always room for improvement, right? ;-)

true,rioso,null,null,"The swiss railways are always benchmarking with the Japanese. Our corporate management was in China and Japan last year. They came back with plenty of Ideas. First one interesting information on Japan. The japanese railways make 3/4 of their earnings by real estate, 1/4 by transport. At SBB it's the opposite. That made change our strategy in the real estate departement.
Now to answer to your suggestions
1)I am part of a project to test which methods from Japan we could use in Switzerland as well. As you remark correctly, in some train stations, there is too few space for the people getting in/out the train. That also causes delays in the tight schedule, leading to delays on other trains. There are several difficulties to have a exact stop:a)to break exactly, probably the train would have to reduce the speed earlier (today up to 80km/h when arriving at the gate). The swiss schedule often is so tight, that you would lose some seconds which would lead to delays by doing that. b) the weather. When it's wet, the braking way is longer. Would need to slow down even more.c) we have many different train types, which makes the project a real challenge.
d)the people: Japanese are very organised. We are already curious how the swiss will adapt!
The first actions we well take will be next year in the region of Basel.

2) But we found out that it is very difficult to get commuters (which probably make 95% of the travellers) to change their habits. They know where to get in to be on the right place by arrival. But that's just not what is best for SBB. we would love the people to spread all over the gates, so the in/out process would be faster and in the train, there will be a better distribution as well. But in fact, we are thinking on doing it for disabled people.

3)We made studies on that. Because the public transport is one big system and every company should do it in order to be a real win for the people. But this study is a few years old, probably it's again on the task list.

We are actually developping systems to measure the movements of the passengers in the train station in order to understand better what happens on the gates and in the passages. So we can plan better for the future an improve the quality of stay in the stations by simple measure (eg placing the bins on the right spot).

Edit: Also, the tidbit about JR's earnings in the real estate is astonishing. I can imagine that part of the reason is also, that most of JR's non-Shinkansen train lines are actually in the red.

true,handsy_pilot,null,null,"American here, lived in CH for six months back in 2009. I don't know how long you are there but, at least then, the SBB had two programs I utilized:

1) [Halbtax](http://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/railpasses/half-fare-travelcard.html): Paid something like 250 CHF to have the ability to pay half of any fare, with discounts also extended on gondolas and boats, and I think some museums.

2) [Gleis7](http://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/railpasses/track-7.html): Forgot what it cost, but holding this gave you the privilege of traveling for free on most modes of transit after 7 pm/1900z until the trains basically stopped running.

Even with what seemed to be a large, upfront cost, it saved me soooo much money in that six months. I would plan my travels around that 7 pm time, usually only paying 3-5 CHF to get from near St. Gallen to Basel. I'd spend the money I saved on beers for the journey.
