Yeah, I hope it won't... Usually it's about -5 to 5 approximately. But snow is less and less common in the Leman Lake side of Switzerland: there's less and less every year. You'll see how it is when you'll get there.

About weed: this is (for me at least) a medium complex subject: you CAN grow up to five cannabis plant (also heard four) you COULD have a certain amount with you without problem. Now, they made a law that fines you 100 CHF if caught smoking or, I guess, having some without getting to pass in front of a judge, etc. I'm not into law myself and doesn't know much about cannabis regulation. You WILL smell people smoking weed in the street without any problem but I can't quote the law for sure... At home you won't have any problem, so far I know.
