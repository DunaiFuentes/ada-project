Used to work for a famous Swiss watch company (high-end watches, à la Patek Philippe) in the marketing department and learnt a lot! Given that is was one of the biggest watch groups out there (not Swatch...), I learnt a lot about what makes a watch worth the price, and which Maison brings what.

I am a BIG fan of IWC, though over the past two years, their marketing talk has overtaken some of their nicer models (though I would LOVE a Portofino 8-Days).

I think in Switzerland, if you can, a Jaeger LeCoultre is an absolute must. I am lucky enough to have worn one on many occasions and the details of the dial, the in-house watch movements, the precision and the instantly recognizable Reverso make it a stunning brand.

Many people dislike Rolex, but they make the toughest and strongest watches out there, and trust me, when you pay a lot for a watch, at least having a truly scratch resistant and solid watch is great. The JLC I have owrn, although amazing, just doesn't give off the same durability and reliability (has already been back to JLC once...)

Omega is a solid Maison, the quality of the watches, their movements and their finishings are all very good. Some people think Omega is a ""cheaper"" brand than Rolex, but this is definitely not the case. Omega has rich history!

Regarding the Hour Vision Blue, I think it the one of the more elegant blue dress watches you can get. Legible, not too thick (important in my opinion for a dress watch), a striking blue and Omega's coaxial movements (saphire caseback!) make this a great watch.

I believe that watches should be bought by heart rather than by mind, so if you try it and you love it, you should get it!",0,1356824475,null,0,false,0,c7nzngj,t3_15l84y,t1_c7nzngj,t1_c7nymt6,null,1430802926,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
