For the passport you need to undergo biometric procedures, and usually you just make an appointment at the local ""Einwohneramt"" of your municipality or canton. They have a booth where they take your picture, finger prints and so on. This is not the case for the ID card, that's why you need a picture.

Our national railways company [SBB](http://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html) offers a lot of deals. For instance if you travel a certain route every day. Or if you are under 25. There is a card, called ""Halbtax"", which is almost mandatory because you will pay half the price on all routes. For people under 25, there is the option to get the so called ""Gleis7"". It allows you to travel for free after 7pm on all trains and various public transportation companies. There is also the so called ""GA Junior"" - While it's expensive (2'400 CHF) it allows you to travel with all trains and most buses in Switzerland for a year. There are also so-called ""Strecken Abos"" where you can save money for routes that you travel on daily.

Switzerland's biggest and probably only haute-couture house is based here (Akris). It is also home to one of Europe's most prestigious business schools, the HSG.

Tbh. I feel bad telling you this, these regulations are probably what I hate most in this country. It's really discriminating against non-Europeans and it was basically forced upon us / accepted as part of our contracts with the EU.

Edit: Just to give you an idea about what bare minimum means: A sublease / student room rent starts at about 300 CHF in smaller towns, 450 CHF in Zurich. Food / daily stuff is at least about 15 CHF per day and that's the *really* cheap stuff, I'm talking pasta with canned tomatoes all day long.
