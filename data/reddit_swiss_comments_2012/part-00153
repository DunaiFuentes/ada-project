First, I'm sorry I won't be of much help. I do bring you two links from earlier similar encounters on /r/Switzerland: 

[Anyone from Ticino/Tessin](http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/r1xlr/anyone_from_ticinotessin/) 

[Help, a few questions about Lugano](http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/trhu7/help_a_few_questions_about_lugano/)

I do, however, have a question of my own that is preying on my mind in relation to the second link: What is your profession? The reason I ask is because I can't figure out what industry there is in Ticino that needs to look for its employees beyond the EU. I don't mean this to offend, but I imagine that the hassle for the company with work-visas is decidedly bigger and thus I imagine there must be a special reason. Indeed, it is likely more of a compliment to your qualifications.

That said I would recommend watching a game of hockey at the Valascia in Ambrì, since due to the lock-out in the NHL there are some big shots playing in Switzerland. Ambrì makes up its lack of money (and thus lock-out players) with heart and an - at times - incredible atmosphere. Also the stadium is open on one end, so dress warmly. (The easier, but less romantic way would be to watch a game in Lugano, where the money and lock-out players are on the home team).",0,1351897053,null,0,false,0,c6vjdua,t3_12j8zq,t1_c6vjdua,t3_12j8zq,null,1430304876,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

The arguments of the SVP are in my opinion a tad irritating. The farmer union supports the campaign for the revision but the farmer's party works against it. At their party convention they have also talked about obligatory vaccination for humans being introduced through the backdoor... which is extremely silly""
