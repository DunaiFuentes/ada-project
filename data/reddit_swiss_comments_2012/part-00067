However, the situation might present itself differently in a whole lot of cases: Inherited property, older people who have been living there for ages. Or just in general people who actually OWN a property and it's value is greatly diminished by noise.

Also, there's another thing: I am 26 years old and live right in the center of town. God knows I like to party myself. But there are days I'd really like to shoot some of those people. It's not the people having fun and drinking beers. It's a the percentage of god dam fucktards. 
Example? Last week, 5 o'clock in the morning tuesday night: Guy stands outside the bar opposite from my building and screams from the top of his lungs ""Hello, open up"", ""Hello I need beer"" etc. every 20 seconds for over HALF A FUCKING HOUR. It's not easy to wake me up at 5 o'clock with closed windows...

Other example? Week before that: Guy stands outside at 4 o'clock or so, drinks beer from a plastic cup he got from one of the bars, pesters people that walk by, SCREAMS for no reason &amp; pisses all over the shops down there including my fucking building door. (While there are open bars 5 fucking feet from him). The very best part: Literally WHILE he is pissing, the security guard from one of the bars hands him a new beer in his free hand.

Unfortunately, though, not much can be done. There just are too many fucktards roaming the streets on weekend nights. I just wish middle aged/older people moving into the city center would consider this at least a moment instead of gloating at the prospect of walking to the Migros or to the bank in 2 minutes. But fucktards on weekend nights, that's how things are this day and age. Old people who have been living in the city center probably have it the worst, since they have gone from a tranquil to batshit crazy nightlife during their lifespan. All I can say is that I pity them for witnessing that change, but it's still not OK if a club/bar closes because of the complaints of one senior citizen (or middle age) household, as it has happened in Berne.

A friend of mine lived above the Aarbergergasse in Berne, probably the worst street to live on during weekends. He loved living so centrally, but didn't get solid sleep Friday and Saturday nights.

In my view, that risks asking for too much.  The $CAD 7000 figure comes simply from cost savings from eliminating programs it replaces in Canada.  There are likely great arguments for raising taxes and providing greater basic income/social dividends, but those arguments should probably be made after the majority accepts an amount it knows it can afford.

And homeopathy with it projected &lt;100 millions doesn't matter at all, compared to conventional costs of dozens of billions. I hope they treat favorably non-issues with non-working placebos.
