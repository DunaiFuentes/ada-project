true,Eskapismus,null,null,"&gt; 1) how hard is it to find such a job for myself in switzerland?

Feasible, unemployment is still very low and affects mostly pple with lower education. Contact a recruiter

&gt; 2) what is home-buying like in switzerland? is it more common to rent? what are typical rents or apartment prices for, say, kreis 1 in zurich?

I'd say maybe 3000 US for a 3 room apt. in Kreis 1. I would first rent something to get used to the place. Kreis 1 is not the best place to be in my opinion. Maybe you also want to live outside of Zurich in one of the tax heavens? My favorite district in Zurich is Kreis 8 by the way. 

&gt; 3) as a foreigner, what's the best way to position myself to move to zurich?

Well I don't think you need me to tell you this but the easiest way is obviously if you get sent here by a employer in the States (Swiss, US or anything) that will do the whole relocation for you (including spousal placing). I know a few people who came here exatly like this, however those weren't people who wanted to come here. 

PS: UN mostly pays shitty wages. ",0,1332106449,null,0,false,0,c42dcg4,t3_r1bll,t1_c42dcg4,t3_r1bll,null,1428549081,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
