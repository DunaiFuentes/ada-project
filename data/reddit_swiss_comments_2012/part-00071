I even managed to help out my carreer a bit by getting a position at the Spiez lab.  I also think that it should stay compulsory, just the way it is.  I certainly wouldn't have done my service if I wasn't forced.

One thing that's undeniable is that it is a huge pain in the ass.  But it has a number of social benefits that go beyond the nebulous value of 'defending our homeland' (though international politics looking the way they are, that might be more important in the coming years).  In addition to on-demand skilled and unskilled labor for civil emergency projects, army service mixes everyone culturally, because you're put in units with rich people, poor people, vaudois and bernois.  Remember that the federal army was instituted to prevent civil war.  Defense is and always was a secondary concern to cultural unity.

As for the concern that it's a huge waste of money, I don't really see that.  We get paid shit, and the hardware we use is reasonably inexpensive for military supplies.  It's certainly not as bad as the US military which spends ungodly sums of money on jets and aircraft carriers, only to lose half of it to inefficiency.  But I'm not a fourier, so I don't look at the books.

The large majority live in the foothills and flatlands that while beautiful and clean, are not much different climate wise than any suburb on the mid eastern corridor.  Second, citizenship is not just ""not easy"", its incredibly demanding.  You must live in Switzerland for 12 years, learn a language, pass a test, and after all that the community you apply to live on takes a vote.  So if they don't like you, your toast.  Furthermore, getting a visa to work is difficult, especially because you are not an EU citizen, and snooping around for a job or an apartment will require a lot of time and patience, and you'll probably need to be in Switzerland for said time.  

The other major detail is that Switzerland is incredibly expensive.  Zurich is the most expensive city on earth.  So until you have a job in Switzerland, you better be sitting on a pretty big surplus of cash in the interim.  

I don't mean to sound like a pessimist, or that you are unwelcome in Switzerland or the like, but I think you need to take a step back and consider your situation.  

I can't profess to know what your experience with the USA has been, but I've had a lot of experience in the US and I can tell you that there is arguably more societal, cultural, geographic, economic, and social diversity there than there is in all of western Europe.  You're young and you have a lot to discover.  Furthermore, Swiss culture is not exactly a walk in the park, especially coming from the US; It is not an easy society to become integrated into.  I'd be happy to expand and explain more if you like, but if I can leave you with one thing, it is this: 

You have an enormous number of paths open to you at this juncture in your life regardless of where you're coming from.  Until you really feel you have a solid grasp of what they are, don't jump in over your head.  Switzerland is a wonderful country and I have no doubt that if you persevere, some day you will make it here.  But that being said, integration into the Swiss society, economy, job market, housing market, government, language, etc. is an incredibly challenging step to take, even when compared to other western European countries.  I would not set your heart on it just yet.  

The US military will not offer an escape from the culture you find distasteful, but It is a great way to get a head start on your education, your travels, your finances, and your discovery.

At first, I did not wanted to join the army, not at all. I came prepared to the initial visit with medical certificates stating I got shoulder pain (semi-bullshit) and would not be able to carry heavy loads for long times. 

During the visit they just told me ""heh, I am afraid that's not enough to skip service"".. okkk. Then, the psychologist told me ""heh, I see you are not willing to spend months of your life in the army, you don't care about blahblah.. but anyhow, you still have to do it. So, I will at least grant you to do whatever you choose in the army""... ok.

Coming from a Scientific Highschool I decided to join the ABC (although I took physics and not chem): best decision ever.

As it turned out, in they do 1 year lab/1 year decontamination.. I got in the decontamination: a shitty job, seriously. Soldiers are basically washing vehicles and other soldiers from radioactive dust and bio/chem agents. Meh. 

Fortunately, the initial instruction (after the first 6 weeks which are the same for everybody [although quite relaxed in the ABC]) was very much like being in school: lots of theory with some practical exercises, less ""stupid"" outdoor activities (like rolling in the dirt and shit like that).

At some point, they proposed me to become Corporal. Now, this grade exists only in the ABC and in the Post/Mail corps. You are basically a soldier with more instruction and 'power'. A specialist if you will. 

The cool thing being a Corporal is that we never had to really do anything specific/boring (like washing things or working in a lab), but know a bit of everything and be able to instruct small groups of soldiers. 

During my VBA, I was with the Panzer Gren. I did not took part in their exercises because I didn't have their instruction (and tbh physical condition): I had to do instruct group of soldier. Not everyday. Not all day long. I had a lot of free time an dread a lot of books xD 

In the end, I learned a lot: very interesting ABC stuff (also general) and how to manage groups of people.

I grew up in the United States.  Most cultures are very stratified with very little interaction with people of higher or lower socio-economic status than onesself.

The whole sexism thing is a valid, but not very worthwhile point.  The army is an old insitution, it's not going to start forcing women into it without a strong political will to do so, and it's just not present, especially since most people don't want to do it in the first place.  So in short, yes, it's kind of sexist but that's hardly a reason to get worked up over it.  Women can join the army if they want.  Remember we don't have any extant threats at the moment, so there's not some major force pushing for a bigger army.

Finally, I want to talk about your first point, which is probably the only real reason you dislike the army.  All the other points are supplemental to this idea that it's bullshit to give up a year of your life.  Having freedom to do what you want all the time is less valuable if you never have to live life without freedoms.  It's important to learn a modicum of humility and discipline in your life, and five months of AgA and FgA is far from an unreasonable sacrifice to achieve that goal.  Yes it's a pain in the ass, but you can't live a life without hardship, and if AgA is the worst my life is going to be, then I think I'll have lived a good life.  And there's even the option to do your service without a weapon.

One last thing regarding your comment insinuating that recruits are boisterous assholes getting drunk in their free time: I think you're misinterpreting 18 year old kids doing what they do normally for some corrupting influence of the army.  18 to 21 year olds get drunk and obnoxious.

In my experience, the people who absolutely want to serve are not the ones you'd trust around guns. Especially not if those guns could end up with the business end towards you. A militia is a somewhat saner solution, since it's highly unlikely that you could turn it against its own people.
What kind of bugs me about conscription though is that it's discriminatory. It shouldn't be just the guys that lose 300+ days on a glorified boyscout exercise. Women are just as capable as men, so why should they get off scot free?

Nobody thinks the Swiss army is an exceptionally good military force.
(Except for the BerufsmilitÃ¤rs, but they're kind of special anyways.)
I think it's highly unlikely that we'll see an armed conflict that involves Switzerland in our lifetime.
The way I see it, the main use for the military in this day and age are subsidiary missions. If some disaster were to happen, e.g. an earth quake in Basel like in 1536, military structure would make it possible to mobilize a large work force with a clear hierarchy in a short amount of time.

Yes, it's a shit time. Some of your superiors are dicks, some of your subordinates are dicks, and some of your peers are dicks too. When you're not pointlessly running around, you're sitting on your hands, waiting for someone to come up with the glorious idea that you should be running somewhere again. You do stupid shit, and if some nutjob is not happy with how you did that mind-numbingly boring, useless and inane task, you do it over. You see pitiful people who think they're better than you, because they have a few squiggly lines on their lapels, but you know that they don't amount to much if you take away their uniform.

However, you also get to meet good people you would never have met otherwise. From the Indian doctor to the Bosnian male nurse (murse?) over to the bernese farmer and the accountant from Zurich, you're thrown into a situation in which you're forced to work together with all kinds of people you don't know. That's a valuable experience, but only if your peers are not a group of complete wankers. I was lucky in that regard. Also depends on the branch you're serving in.

true,Vlip,be,Bern,"First there are a few myths on the Swiss army that needs to be casted away:

1Â°/ We don't need an army to defend ourself

Well, that's entirely true. But we don't have an army to defend ourself anyway so that point is moot.

The Swiss army is a training army, not an operative army (with the notable exception of some parts of the airforce which really do real live engagement).

Its mission is not to be capable of defending the country against a foreign invasion but to maintain the know-how necessary to do so.
The idea is that if the world goes to shit in 50 years, we need to be able to rebuild our army in a few years.

So all the Swiss army does is maintain a minimum amount of units of all kinds to maintain the know-how and enough mass to be able to retrain a real army.

Why bother? Well, army know-how is way more than just what you learn in the infantry. It's strategy, tactics, logistics, communication, combined arms,... Once you lost that know-how rebuilding it to any kind of competency takes decades (see Lybia's rebels for how well a group of civilians with no idea of warfare fare in a fight against trained units, it's not pretty even if you have NATO giving you a crash course).

Who can garantee that in 50 years, 70 years, 100 years, Europe will still be at peace?

2Â°/ The army costs a lot of money

The army is the only department that got its budget reduced every year for decades now. 
If you look at it as a % of GDP, the Swiss army's budget got cut in half since the 90s. 
Problem is, there is a point at which you can't cut any further before making the whole construct pointless and we are at it (the army only managed to make the last few rounds of cuts by stopping investment, which means it's now slowly but surely rotting away).

3Â°/ The militia army is expensive, we'd save money with a smaller professional force

This is completely wrong, it's actually entirely the opposite. The Swiss army saves a massive amount of money by being able to call to service Swiss people for extremly cheap.
A professional army would mean having to pay competitive salaries, year long, on tens of thousands of people. Just the salaries would gobble most of today's budget leaving little left for logistics, hardware,...

----------------------------------

Now that I have that off my chest here is my personal opinion.

I join the others who say that the Swiss army is a brilliant way to improve social and cultural cohesion in our country. I was a snobish and out of touch kid of a upper middle-class family with a good education and making friends with what I could qualify as ""the rest of the country"" (Swiss-Germans, Swiss-Italians, poor kids, really-rich kids, kids with no education,...) made me a better man.

I too would like to have women share our experiences but right now the politicians seem hell bent on reducing the amount of men in the army so getting the recruitment pool doubled is hardly a priority even though it is the principled thing to do (count me in on your initiative).

I would also like to point out one very big truth I learned in the army itself. The very last persons you want in an army are those who want to be in an army!!!
Just think about it, who would go in a professional army?

You do not want an army comprised solely of those who are gung ho about the military. You also need some form of army. Not for military purposes, mind you. It's just a good way to mobilize a large work force in case of a disaster. How else are you going to organize the people needed for a relief effort in a short amount of time?

Therefore, I maintain that the militia system is necessary and the best option currently available to us. And I still maintain that equal rights means equal duties. Therefore, compulsory service extending to women in the name of equality is not stupid. It's fair. Your ridiculing of the strive for equality leaves somewhat of a bad aftertaste. You can't have the cake and eat it too. That's a childish notion.

On the biological side, yes, women are out of commission for the time frame before, during and after birth. But I could also argue as [hubraum](http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/uw63a/whats_you_position_on_compulsory_army/c4zhoxr) did: Statistically speaking, men die five years earlier than women. Your argument about having to take time off due to pregnancy looses some of its impact in the light of the time men have to spend pushing up daisies.

Bear with me for a second here. Let's say military or civil service was mandatory for women, too. Now everybody has to spend time not pursuing their career. Wouldn't that level the playing field in terms of professional opportunities? Furthermore: More people for the same work means less time necessary for the same work. One could argue, that in that case, the service period could be shortened for everybody. Win-win. Except for the service part, but see above. Cake and so on.

Edit: Paternity leave? Yes please. That would further level the playing field.

true,Paranoiapuppy,null,null,"I think you misunderstood me. The main reason for a militia is that you cannot turn it against its own people. A militia is a heterogeneous group, made up of all kinds of people. The only thing they have in common is that they're Swiss/whatever. Voluntary armies however can consist of a group with a special agenda. Imagine if we had a voluntary army, and some extremist group would make up the majority of volunteers. Extremists as the only people with guns? That's not a very reassuring thought. That's why the militia system is probably the best one, if we want to keep the army.
Getting rid of the army altogether is not something I'd be in favor of, especially when keeping in mind the different scales at play regarding France/Switzerland. I highly doubt that all our civil protection agencies combined would be a work force big enough to provide adequate relief after a major disaster. We'd need the army to pick up the slack.

true,YouLikaDaJuice,null,null,"Swiss culture and society is not particularly easy to penetrate for a number of reasons.  First you have the language.  There are four national languages, the most common of which is Swiss German.  Swiss German a heavy dialect of German which is also not a written language, making it very difficult to learn.  It even varies in pronunciation and vocabulary from valley to valley. Don't even get me started on Romansh.  Anyway, suffice to say its a pain in the ass, though luckily in places like Zurich most people will speak English just fine.  

Switzerland is also a very crowded country, and while there is a very large immigrant population (~10%) in Switzerland, there are significant political forces which are really attempting to keep immigration to a minimum.  Thus if you have any intention of getting residence permits or even work permits, its really important to either get admitted to a university or to find a job.  The Swiss have a pretty low tolerance for people who are not contributing to the laborforce in some meaningful way.  I have an american friend who was recently deported (despite the fact that both of her parents live there permanently)  essentially because she didn't have a legit enough job.  For the foreseeable future, marriage is the only relatively easy route to citizenship.  Otherwise, its many years and a massive gamble.  For now, aim lower (like a work visa or a B permit).

On to social culture. Its not necessarily an easy place to meet people as an outsider, or as anyone for that matter. Unlike the US, it is not really normal to start a conversation with a random person on the train for instance.  People pretty much keep to themselves and their friends, even in social environments like clubs and bars.  Not impossible, just a hell of a lot more difficult than in the US, where people are far more loud, and have less social conservatism and reservation.  Furthermore, amongst the older populous, there can be a fair amount of xenophobia and outside of large cities with very international populations, most of Switzerland is fairly rural.  These reigons share many of the same characteristics that you would find in your average rural american community.

Anyway, these are just a few of my thoughts on the issue based on my experiences.  You're not gonna find too many gay-hating evolution-denying conspiracy-theorizing dumb-as-dirt rural hicks in Switzerland, but that doesn't mean the country is going to welcome you with open arms (though being white would help).  You need to understand that everyone wants to move to Switzerland.  Its arguably the most economically, politically, and physically safe country in the world.  Salaries are insane, social programs are great, and its a beautiful place.  What  you need to think about is what you can do for the Swiss.

But it's a yearly investment to protect our future if we ever need to.

The problem, sadly, is like this:

Can you predict 50 years in advance if we'll have to go to war?

If the answer is no, then you pretty much have to maintain that know-how permanently in a way that allows you to react to future developments in a timely fashion.
Sadly armies are huge complicated things and just making everyone go shoot at a firing range every year doesn't cut it anymore and so ~5 billion CHF is probably around the irreductible cost of maintaining that know-how.

There are ways we could save more money. For example we could decide that Switzerland only maintain, say infantry know-how and have a treaty with other countries so that they maintain the other know-how we would miss (armored warfare, artillery,...).
