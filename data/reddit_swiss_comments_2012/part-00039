Basically the only way you can get a permit is if the employer can prove that they cannot find the right person with the right skills in CH or the EU. So it's quite a hassle for them as well. 

My contract is for 2 years, but I only have a 1 year permit. I have to reapply at the end of the year, and there is no guarantee that it will be reapproved. :-/",0,1333662177,null,0,false,0,c48xu3v,t3_rfpsy,t1_c48xu3v,t1_c45gmv1,null,1428663479,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

I'd hate to think what their response would be if I asked for a mortgage.

i wonder if an american bank can mortgage a swiss house.  at the end of the day it's just a loan.  question is whether the laws allow american banks to attach a security interest on foreign property.

edit: my banker tells me i can.  great.  but idk at the end of the day, ill probably buy property in hte states and rent in switzerland.  as long as i have equity somewhere in the world, ill be happy.  it doesnt necessarily have to be outside the US (and it's probably easier for me to work with taxes in terms of appreciation if the property is in the US). oh well ill see when the time comes.  thanks for hte suggestion though

ill still be keeping my american credit cards (which waive the foreign transction fees), though it would be useful to have a swiss credit card as im not sure how strong the dollar will be at the time. lots of things to think about",0,1333738209,null,0,true,0,c4991u0,t3_r1bll,t1_c4991u0,t1_c48y0cc,null,1428668909,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

true,Vlip,be,Bern,"IT jobs in the Swiss French part are mostly to be found in Geneva (a not quite comfortable commute from Noiraigue of ~2h). There you can probably find jobs that pay just slightly short of what you'd get in Zürich.

The second IT pole would be Lausanne, about 1h30 away from Noiraigue. 

Those two cities probably have about 80% of all IT jobs in the Swiss french part.
Your chances of finding an IT job in smaller cities like Neuchâtel or La Chaux-de-Fonds are slim and the salary is also going to be a one or two 10ks shorter than in Zürich (but living costs will be way lower).

Since your gf works in Noiraigue I wouldn't focus only on the Swiss-French part.
If you decide to move into Neuchâtel (good railway hub near Noiraigue) you can get into Lausanne in 45 minutes and you can get to Bern in the same 45 minutes or Biel in 20 minutes.

Bern is the capital city of Switzerland and a significant IT job hub, language is German though.
Biel is a smaller city but home to a big watchmaking industry that needs some IT jobs.

Not speaking a national language is an issue though, Geneva and Zürich would be the easiest place to find a job without knowing the national language since most international conglomerates operate out of there.

The secondary hubs like Lausanne or Bern will be tougher but not impossible, especially knowadays where IT specialists are hard to find.
