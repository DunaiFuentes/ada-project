true,YeaISeddit,bs,Basel-Stadt,"I was curious about the ""Job Seekers"" permit. I'm not sure such a permit exists. EU/EFTA nationals can come for 90 days on a tourist visa and try and extend their stay using an L or F for another three months. In order to get an F you need to show that moving immediately would cause you some sort of harm. These are usually for refugees or asylum seekers. The L permit can be obtained without employment if you are applying for jobs. It varies from Canton to Canton, but I know that in Basel, you have to have weekly meetings with a career advisor, apply for a certain number of jobs per week, among many other bureaucratic intricacies. There's also no guarantee you get the L permit after your first three months. It is up to their discretion to decide whether you have a reasonable chance to get a job within the next three months. If they decide that that is unlikely they could simply deny the permit. 

I found a website that describes the visa process for EU/EFTA nationals without a job ([here](http://www.myscience.ch/living/moving_to_ch/work_permit/eu_efta).

Also, OP, I forgot one other option. She could apply to attend a school in Zurich. She could always drop out if she finds a job. ",0,1349023177,null,0,false,0,c6fkd55,t3_10pjpy,t1_c6fkd55,t1_c6fj8gz,null,1430028259,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3
true,sh545,null,null,"I wouldn't be called a jobseekers permit, no. But if you went to register on your first day in Switzerland, you'd would get an L-permit valid for ~6 months (90 days visiting + 3 months permit) i.e. you don't have to use up your tourist stay before registering, they will take account of it, which also allows you to get a job more easily in that period. I suppose they would also consider whether you were likely to get a job, but I think that is mostly a formality if you are an ""old-EU"" national with no quotas that apply. I don't think they have the weekly meetings in Zurich either, that's only if you are receiving RAV, and then it's only once every two weeks.",0,1349025265,null,0,false,0,c6fkv80,t3_10pjpy,t1_c6fkv80,t1_c6fkd55,null,1430028495,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

Your income won't help with that, because your relationship isn't official, if they gave her a permit on that basis, absolutely anyone could get a permit by faking a relationship for a short period.

If you were married or had a civil partnership, she would automatically get the same permit as you.",0,1349033253,null,0,false,0,c6fmvsl,t3_10pjpy,t1_c6fmvsl,t1_c6fl7iw,null,1430029445,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
