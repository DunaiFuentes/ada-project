- The guy himself would have been armed with a gun and not just with knives. 
- The shooting would have started already in the train station itself. 
- The police would certainly not have shot him in the leg, but aimed at killing him. 
- Before that, the guy might have killed one of the policemen 
- And as this might have been quite a massive shooting in a super busy place, the chance that a bystander got killed are quite high.

&gt;Don't confuse Sweden with Switzerland! **And no, USA and Switzerland are not comparable.** In particular, wearing a gun in public (like above mentioned, possibly a teacher) is generally prohibited except in certain cases. You posted yourself the link to the wikipedia article. Read the section about carrying guns. Read it!

If you don't think that they're comparable, why do you compare them yourself? 

I know you try to refer to the US police as gun-wielding maniacs concerning the latest gun-involved and the gun law discussion resulting out of it.
Whatsoever you put everything in a much too simple context and neglect important aspects concerning a gun law discussion.

Having all this said, I, once again, would like to cite what /u/LeSpatula said in [his post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/wwnao/swiss_gun_laws/c5h77ik) trying to explain why Switzerland is not *safer* from gun violence because of just the law:
