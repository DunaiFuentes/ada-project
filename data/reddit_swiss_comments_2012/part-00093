I sometimes miss Japan too, when I'm not here. Although it's geologically one of the most dangerous places on earth I feel strangely safe here - just because of that strong community. Also, everything is conventient and you always know what you get without even knowing the specific store you're at. 

Of course some stuff also bothers me though. The buildings feel safe, yet they lack the kind of quality we have back home. Especially now when everyone wants to preserve energy it seems strange to me that they don't want to improve thermal isolation as the first measure. 

You know, every place has its charms I guess. If you get the chance to visit Switzerland, I recommend it as well. I'd say no other place of more or less significant size is that well kept, people spend insane resources on keeping everything 'neat'. I'd call Swiss people 'gardeners' in a way (for example you can also observe all the community garden plots, sometimes even at the best places like in the midst of Zurich's beverly hills with lake view).

We have mandatory background check and ten day waiting period, anyone with a criminal or mental health history cannot purchase a firearm. In order to even buy a handgun you have to be 21 and are required to take a mandatory certification test.

You're also not allowed to walk around with a concealed firearm you need a permit from the county that usually requires approval from your local police/sheriffs office and only if you have a valid reason for carrying it around with you.


Only wish my country had an actual good social welfare system, I'd imagine It would do a lot more for dropping crime in general if people could get the help they needed easier than they could purchase a firearm.

true,charliedonsurf1,null,null,"Exactly, and that is a problem that needs to be changed. 

In the US the goal of almost every high school student is to attend college. But college is supposed to be for intelligent people, and therefore not everyone should be able to attend. There are other jobs that need to be filled that do not require a worthless 4 year degree. Because you have so many students attending college, made also possible by government backed student loans, the price for college rises. It has become very lucrative to be a university. No matter what you do as a Uni you will have students. It does not even matter how good the educational programs are, because the students will still spend 20k per annum to attend.

What the US needs is a system as we have here in Switzerland where students are early on already separated in to their respective intelligence group (But always have a chance to move up through examination). The highest level can attend a specific school (Gymnasium) that will prep them for Uni and give you the diploma Matura, the middle can attend another specific school (Secondary) for 3 years, where next to that they have to obtain an internship, called a learning position. All companies prefer that, because they can then train someone hands on while that person also learns the theoretical part in school. I would say about more than 50% of students take the middle route.

It is an efficient system, which in the end leaves the student having full knowledge about his profession and most even proud of what they do (being plumber, ect.).",0,1343026106,null,0,false,0,c5i05mk,t3_wwnao,t1_c5i05mk,t1_c5hucgu,null,1429445443,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3
true,Moonkanna,null,null,"you're saying we need guns to protect ourselves from guns. The more guns out there = the less violence perpetrated, by this logic. 

I simply don't see that happening. People being the irrational brutes they often are (I wish we were'nt, but I've seen too many instances of guys 'seeing red' and smashing people in the face, god knows what woulda happened had guns been around)

I really think the solution is to get the people to chill out, so to speak. Why be so worried about felons ransacking your home? Why are there so many home ransackings (if there really are and this shit isn't just hyped up)?? It has to do with being a civilized nation, a culture of humans able to resolve their differences without blowing eachothers brains out, or the threat thereof. 

With guns not really promoting 'freedom' I mean that they get you caught up in cycles of violence that are likely to leave you dead or incarcerated. If you don't go around thinking others mean to harm you --&gt; therefore you need a gun (living in constant fear) you will be much more 'free'. Then you can focus your energies on actual constructive things. Sorry, but I'm no fan of fear &amp; loathing (the book is great though).
