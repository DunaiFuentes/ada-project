One important point is that Swiss people are fairly conservative in their eating habits - you can see this in the enormous preponderance of Italian places even in quite foreigner-heavy areas, all serving pretty much the same pizza and pasta &amp;c. People will try new stuff, but they have to have it explained in a non-threatening way first. Just handing them a menu will have them scratching their heads and asking ""so wie funktionniert's hier?"". There's also something of a local aversion to spicy-hot food - ""ach, isch scharf!"" due to the relative blandness of the local cuisine, so non-spicy options are needed too

Switzerland has not been a haven for very wealthy tax dodgers for a long time (source:  I work in financial services IT and have a lot of experience with Swiss banking projects in compliance, also have to stay on top of stuff like CAML and local / regional laws.)  

The money goes to places like Vanuatu and Singapore, even in the US (which is one of the, if not the, world's largest repository for dirty money, particularly from South America).  Switzerland has some of the tightest rules about laundered money, thus removing all the nasty third world tyrants from circulation, and the risk of exposure from all the assholes selling CDs of account data to the Germans and French have made it unattractively risky to most wealthy tax dodgers.  

The banks got badly burned from the fallout from guys like Birkenfeld, and from the shit they did with the holocaust money - right now it's all damage control to try and salvage whatever privacy regulations they can.  What we'll probably end up with is a regime whereby accounts are taxed at whatever rates the account holder's source country dictates, and that money transferred, if that will keep secrecy intact.

People put their money in Switzerland because it still offers a far higher degree of discretion than any surrounding country, it's stupidly stable and safe (including the currency), and the bank services are incredibly professional (having lived in France, Singapore, Chile, Argentina, the US, the Netherlands, and Germany, other countries' retail banking is a fucking catastrophe in comparison).",0,1344332542,null,0,false,0,c5pen9u,t3_xtdqb,t1_c5pen9u,t3_xtdqb,null,1429573714,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

&gt; I do not believe you.

That's not my problem.  I speak from experience.  I was trying to clear up some common misconceptions.

First off, I have no loyalty to banks.  They fucked up so much with the holocaust money alone, accepting money from people like Mobutu, Marcos and Abacha, and with actively trying to get people to avoid taxes in their home country that it's not a question of sympathy.  I work for them because they pay best in my field. Swiss people are not defensive because they somehow love UBS or Credit Suisse, they are defensive because they feel their national sovereignty is being attacked from cultures that have shown in the past that they have little respect for popular democracy.

If you bring over 100k CHF and try to open an account in Switzerland, you are required to meticulously provide proof of the origin of this money.  If you are a citizen of a country with whom the Swiss have a bilateral source taxation treaty, your funds are then taxed on the interest on the account in accordance with Swiss tax law; the taxes are collected and anonymously submitted to your country of origin.  

It is not the job of the Swiss government to provide disclosure about identities of account holders to foreign governments.  This is in violation of Swiss secrecy laws, I regret that the Germans do not like it.  Swiss banks currently maintain a balance between reporting requirements to limit/avoid money laundering, and the need to allow clients to bank fluidly.  I once had to withdraw 25k via my French bank toward a payment on an apartment.  In Switzerland I could call ahead, walk in, give my ID, and get the cash.  France?  Holy crap, the bureaucratic shitstorm was amazing.  That is why people bank in Switzerland.

Some banks violate this disclosure requirement, as well as the source taxation.  This means that they are violating the law, and should be prosecuted.  In the past, there have been several misguided attempts to prosecute private bankers in Switzerland (look up Fall Holentweger if you're really interested) for helping tax evasion and money laundering.  This involved massive transgressions of a citizen's personal rights by a judge who was later shown to be acting criminally, and a prosecutor who was just plain nuts and who retired in disgrace.  If banks violate laws and treaties, that does not mean banks are ""dying a slow death"" as the article suggests.  It's nonsense.  Should the Swiss do more to prosecute people who violate laws?  Sure,  yeah, I'm all for it.  Should they sacrifice their national sovereignty because the Germans are mad?  Er, no.

I am not interested in what the ""German users"" have to say on the topic, because I live in Germany and the amount of just downright ignorant misinformation floating around the German media, some of it willful, gives me indigestion.  Nor do I have any belief that the German (and other EU governments) are acting in good faith - you mention Schengen, they've lied about that in the past with regards to extension of the treaty to Romania and Bulgaria, and people like Peer Steinbrück have made their populist credentials pretty clear by using terms like [""whips"" and ""cavalry""](http://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/steinbrueck222.html).   

Your argumentation for why Switzerland stays in Schengen is also nonsense.  It was easy to bring boatloads of cash in before.  Switzerland stays in Schengen because trade with its European neighbors makes up something like 90% of both imports and exports.  Schengen is a good thing because it eases the flow of persons and goods.  It makes everyone richer.  Private banking, the bit that's concerned by the tax evasion, makes up a small and ever-shrinking part of the Swiss economy, and as far as the overall financial services sector goes,  the largest banks and insurances do most of their investment business abroad anyway.  

And I'm not particularly interested in participating in experiments in redditors' nationalistic butthurt on the topic.  I know the topic far better than someone who gets their information from poor reporting.

You say ""it is like that"" and on the other hand say none has to believe you. What is the sense of writing it then?

And just on that Schengen ""nonsense"" you mendion...well, name the country where the MOST PEOPLE bring the money to. (no, not the country where the most money is brought to). It is switzerland. 
And that has nothing at all to do with 90% of import and export. Look at ANY other european country...most export and import from neighbours.
So no matter if private baniking is just a small slice for switzerland, still most german tax evaders find a haven in switzerland. 
It doesn't make a difference how big that slice is to the swiss banking sector.

I'm not discussing.  I'm stating facts.

Of course they bring money there. It's because the banks work, it's close, and there's a high degree of likelihood that exactly the finance ministers who are bitching about Switzerland will happily ruin their own currency.  I can understand why people might want that in Swiss Francs.  It's one of the same reasons (along with insane income tax rates and bureaucracy) why so many international companies are getting the hell out of the EU zone and moving to Switzerland.

What exactly is your point - that Swiss banks should provide 100% transparency to the Finanzamt and Her Majesty's Inland Revenue?

They're in the house and at the range. I don't know if non-citizens can have weapons though. The idea of a weapon for home defence isn't a common one in Switzerland. Your weapon is there (most likely because it is your military issued rifle) for national defence, and if you use a weapon against a person outside of national defence you are going to be beaten pretty hard by the legal system.

Taxes are a progressive tax system, so the more you make the more you pay. You pay income taxes, healthcare taxes (there is a socialized system of healthcare in Switzerland), and the like. A well-off family can end up paying about 48% of their income in taxes.

I'm not sure what you mean by free market for individuals, unless you're talking about the taxes. As for welfare programs, yeah, there are welfare programs and social programs. Europe in general is big on them.

Keep in mind, moving to Switzerland as a non-citizen and without a job is frankly not the best idea.

While having a job is not required to acquire it, i think you need one to renew. After 5 years, you can get a 'settlement permit (C)', which will put you on par with a swiss resident in taxes and almost everything else. Before that, taxes are different and I don't really know how. [More info](http://www.bfm.admin.ch/content/bfm/en/home/themen.html)

- Gun Laws: You need to be a citizen or have the C permit to own a gun. Furthermore you need a clean criminal record. The gun must be kept safely, that means either locked in a casket or being disassembled. To carry guns, you must have a special permit only issued to policemen or people working in security, as well as gun training. **The idea of owning a gun at home for self defence is not considered normal or appropriate in Switzerland.** You might want to join one of the countless shooting clubs if you like shooting though. [More info](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_Switzerland)
- Taxes: While I don't know much about taxes, they are most likely cheaper than in the US. VAT is 8%, and the income tax varies between 0.7% to ~15%, depending on where you live, how much you make and whether you're married. [More info](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxes_in_Switzerland)
- Welfare: In Switzerland you need to have health insurance. That given, medical costs are not something that will ruin you as in the US, going to the doctor is normal. You can get benefits for many things (child support, unemployed support etc.) or deduct stuff from taxes (cost of transportation for work commute etc.)
- Psychology: The title 'psychologist' is reserved for those who have a Masters degree (or equivalent) in Psychology from Switzerland.

I would suggest that you first look for a job or an admission to one of the universities for you and your wife; all the official immigration stuff will be a lot easier then.

Be prepared: moving to another country is mentally not easy. You will have a 'culture shock' for the first one or two years. I had the same while staying in the US. Generally you will be annoyed about how everything is different. From doing the laundry about going to get groceries, commuting to work etc. But this will fade and you will eventually feel totally okay. Example: We Swiss are generally perceived as reserved, people don't just communicate with other strangers publicly as much as in the US; everyone tries to blend in into the 'normal' mass of people.

If you never have been to Switzerland, it would be a good idea to at least spend some holidays here. Just to get a feeling how it could be living here.
