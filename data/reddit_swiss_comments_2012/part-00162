The army is compulsory and you have to take your rifle at home **but without ammunitions**. You are not even allowed to use it. It's basically just a heavy stick wasting space in your closet :D

There is hunting, of course, but I cannot believe Switzerland could reach that position worldwide just with hunting rifles.

How are things in canton Vaud?

true,right_supremacist,null,null,"That is an incredibly valid point. While it is possible that I have an ideal vision of Switzerland, what I can say is that I love the culture, the geography, the region surrounding the country (different cultures are always nice to have), food, and what my perception was, the emphasis on science and education. That last point is probably because of the LHC, but nonetheless, that alone is wonderful.

So, while this may just be my idealization, I suppose I'll find out in college– that is, if I get into Franklin, as mentioned above. I figure I have quite a while until I need to make a permanent decision, but at this point, I would say I'd choose to live in Switzerland.
