A former colleague (now retired) worked in the seventies in a small station. Shortly before closing the desk, somebody came in, threatening him with a knife an demanding the money. My colleague would take a heave book he had an hit him with it. The thief escaped without the money, my colleague got a few franken reward.

Or: Another colleague worked in the train. She once helped a woman who's husband got sick in the train and delayed the train so the wife could go and buy some water for the husband. One year later, on a complete different station, this woman saw my colleague again and would bring her chocolates and say thank you.

Or a sad one: one colleague was working on a larger station, and that's what he saw: There was a couple who was late for the train. They decided to cross the tracks instead of using the passage. They didn't see that on the other track, a train was passing at high speed. One of them was killed by the train. The other one was so shocked and took the train they wanted to take originally together.",0,1342731984,null,0,false,0,c5ggq38,t3_wq6tb,t1_c5ggq38,t1_c5fqfok,null,1429418854,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

The website(s) are running on Adobe CQ (former Day CQ). Coding languages is based on CQ, so it's Java and for the views it's just simple jsp. For the frontend (html/css/js) we are using our own in-house developed framework called Terrific. You can download the open-source version [here](http://terrifically.org/)!

I myself did an apprenticeship as a system engineer. After that I studied computer science and got my bachelor degree. I finally got a job (software engineer, java) in a large web agency .

true,DeepDuh,zh,Zürich,"I think a majority of the guns in Switzerland are military guns that the men keep at home even after they are finished. Ammunition to those type of guns are strictly regulated (not saying it can't be obtained if you really want though), so those guns mostly have sentimental value to their owner. Also I'd say that the military training is sufficient to enable responsible gun ownership for most of the trainees. About 40% of Swiss men still do military training and the others tend to be not very interested in guns. I can't really speak about civil gun laws though, I haven't been involved in those - but yes, civil gun ownership is heavily regulated as far as I know. 

Comparing the US to Switzerland I'd also argue that it's not the gun ownership per se that makes a country more or less violent. That doesn't mean more regulation would improve things though. The fact that you can buy ammunition pretty much wherever you want tells me that it is actually economically viable for supermarkets to sell ammunition. Which I find strange. Who is consuming so much ammunition? What for? We're not a hunter gatherer society anymore are we?

Secondly, I don't get why so many Americans oppose something like mandatory gun training for gun owners. People who want guns want to know how it's like shooting them right?

true,LeSpatula,be,Bern,"Well, most men (are forced to) have a military gun at home. However, they don't have any munition. Munition is provided when you have to do the mandatory shooting each year or when you have to use the gun in the military service. However, it's strictly forbidden to take munition  home from there. People who go shooting in a shooting club can buy the munition they need there.

So yes, most men have a gun, but can't use it. Of course, if somebody really wants, he could get some munition. It's legal to buy it, but there aren't a lot of places where you can.

This was about the military guns. To own a civil gun, you need a permit ""Waffenerwebsschein"", which usually gets everybody who is at least 18 years old, is Swiss and doesn't have any criminal records. However, this is only for owning a gun.

For carrying a gun, you need another permit ""Waffentragschein"", which is valid for 5 years and then must be renewed. This permit is usually only granted to people who work in security and they have to do a test before they get it. Hunter don't need this permit, but they need another license, which also includes a test.

There's no need for owning or even carrying a gun in Switzerland though. I recently saw that video about an American watchmaker who was the victim of armed robberies several times and each time he shot the robbers. This is just unthinkable here. We don't have any gangs, like you have in the USA. And only very, very few armed robberies and even in those we have, usually nobody gets hurt, because those people are just robbers, not murders. I think knives are used more often in robberies than guns and for such situations, we could buy pepper spray to defend ourselves.

So, Switzerland isn't safe because because of the guns, most guns belong to people who went through the military training and those guns are locked-in in the wardrobe without any available ammunition. The key is to provide a good education for everybody, provide job opportunities and security and social welfare and health care for everybody. This way, nobody is forced into criminality because he hasn't any options left.

Here, young people have usually very good job opportunities after hi-school. Only people who want to become a scientist or want to work  in a job where they need a scientific degree, like lawyer or doctor, continue school (which costs about $2000 a year). Everybody else does a apprenticeship in a job he likes (there's one for anything, shop assistant, computer scientist, nurse, hairdresser, etc...). This means 2 to 5 year training, which includes theory in school and practical work at the work place and then they get a degree in that job.

true,rocknrollbreakfast,bs,Basel-Stadt,"I think there are several reasons why there is only little ""criminal activity"" involving military guns.

-[It's a big rifle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIG550): although you often see military walking around with the rifle on their back, it's not really common to see people in civil walking around with it. It's not like a handgun which you can put in your pocket - if you'd take your rifle in civil to a public place (eg restaurant, cinema, bar, club), there's quite a good chance that they'll ask you to leave and for sure everybody will stare at you.

-You learn to hate it: don't really know how to explain that one to the average gun-loving american, but I'll try: I have to take that peace of crap out of the cupboard twice a year and it's never a joyful moment. During the army, I took that fucker apart and put it back together at least a million times. I cleaned it a million times. I had to sleep with it in one bed. I carried it around 20h a day. You kind of learn to hate that thing. You throw it around. You run over it with a truck (survived), you run over it with a tank (not so much...). The urge to use that thing outside of the army is close to absolute zero.

-To your argument of ""tightly controlled"": you have to be aware that the swiss army is a giant mess. I've seen them losing whole tanks (found after 3 weeks), artillery grenades, normal grenades, ammunition, pretty much everything. You want to take ammunition home with you? That's no problem. Sure, it's forbidden, but its unbelievably easy. Even without the army, it's ridiculously easy to get ammo for your rifle: you go to a shooting range, you buy 100 shots, only shoot 50, leave...

Now, for civil gun laws, I think most has been said already, It's very strict and if you want to carry your gun around in public you need a very, very good reason for it (your job).

The main reason we don't have gun problems here is because there is less poverty, healthcare and a better ""social net"" in case you completely fail in life. It has nothing to do with gun ownerships.

Low crime rates have nothing to do with people having guns. I can say with absolute certainty that if a swiss person would never use their military rifle against a thief or other criminal.",0,1342871268,null,0,false,0,c5h7tt0,t3_wwnao,t1_c5h7tt0,t3_wwnao,null,1429431867,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3

This was a few years back, not sure if it's still done. Last time I've heard about it the cops where complaining that neo-nazis where getting excellent hand-to-hand combat training in Isone against them on our dime.

I also knew a guy who accidentally came home with a couple of rounds of AAA ammunition. He chucked it into the river.

Yes, guns get stolen from time to time, I always imagined how easy it must be: you put on your army clothes, walk in, take a gun, walk out. 0% chance anybody would notice...

Also in the usa there are still vast amounts of open land compared to most other countries. When I go outdoorsing or hiking, a gun is useful for incase things go wrong and I get stranded and need food. You can easily be 100 miles from another human being while in the wild of the USA. 

Crime and defense are often secondary uses for guns to many enthusiests in the US. The USA wouldn't be as it is today if it wasn't for guns allowing westward expansion into the wilderness.

I only knew one guy who went and he had serious issues. As he lied all the time I didn't actually believe he went into special training until he disappeared one day without warning. His room-mate, also a friend of mine had to bring all the abandoned guns to the nearest armoury.

true,charliedonsurf1,null,null,"If you want to own a gun in Switzerland you can. Gun laws are strict, but if you have no priors you will pretty much be able to buy a gun.

So here is the thing:

Do all Swiss men have guns? Specifically those in the military. 
Can you purchase a gun? Get a permit and have no priors, yes.
Can you use the military rifle as self defense? Mostlikely not. Use of the military rifle out side of training is a crime, even for self defense. 
Can I defend my own property with my gun? No, you can not. You can only defend with equal force and only after that force has been exercised, so it becomes fishy anyways.
Is it worth owning a gun for self protection? Probably not, be because you would go to jail anyways if you killed the robber.
Better him dead than you being dead? Good question...
Do I own a gun in Switz? I have my grandfathers old rifle from WW1 and 2 and my rifle.

Also don't confuse a hunting permit with a gun permit... but in Switz if you want a gun you can get it. But there is no point because the law is not on your side if you use it. Even if you stab the rober you can get sent to jail.

true,42x13,null,null,"There seems to be a lot of resistance to formal training outside of an academic environment here in the states. At a certain level, receiving specialized training as an individual is almost frowned upon, either as a ""government intrusion"" or as a result of some ""I know better than you do"" mentality.  Whether it's concerning a hunting license or a driving license, the standard seems to be that you pay a little money and...maybe... take a short multiple choice administrative test and you're done. Off topic, but, having had the pleasure of having to take my 80 year old mother's car keys away because she literally didn't know what lane to drive in, really made it hit home that, whether it's because the US is just too big and bureaucratic, or we as a nation are collectively afraid of a regulatory intrusion on our lives (maybe due to strong lobby pressures) we react negatively to any attempt at ""control"".  My mom had passed her driver's ""test"" about a year prior and, though someone could have easily talked to her and discovered her deficiencies, she just looked at the eye chart, and she was done.

I think it has a lot to do with the sense of individualism that we're raised with as well. I lived in Japan for awhile and was (and still am) amazed at the unity of community there. Neighbors talk to their neighbors and have a well developed sense of what's the greater good for the community and the world outside of themselves. When I took my mom's car, her reaction was anger that we had deprived her of independence... Not one thought for the fact that she could very well kill someone or get killed herself. Maybe that's a universal trait though... the idea that ""I know what I'm doing"" even when you really don't...
