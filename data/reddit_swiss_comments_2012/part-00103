true,oelsen,bs,Basel-Stadt,"and *also* remember that the tourist parts of Switzerland aren't at all the same where most humans live around here. Also consider that there is a strong movement to remain in the city where work is, driving up rents. Yes, rents, another thing. Renting is normal around here. A house costs between 600'000 over a felt median around a million up to 2 million Swiss Francs for normal houses in the [Agglo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglomeration). Mortgages aren't paid back (not like in France, e.g.), so you either pay rent or interest rates to a bank. Renting in Zürich Stadt kills you. Most commute to Zurich, which is another growing problem. Commuters live in sleeping villages where the mindset is get-off-my-lawn and quiet-everything. This drives the more adventurous into cities. With the nearing impacts of the dept crisis, I sense a growing sentiments against ""truly foreign"" nationals. Bear in mind that Switzerland already consists of mostly immigrated workers. This can backfire if you only find work where expats and migrants look for themselves and after a while you do not see the point in living here severed from everything else. This happened to a relative of mine in the far East.
