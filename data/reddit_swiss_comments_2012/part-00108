I appreciate your help, though. As for asking someone where he's from, I agree it's usually perfectly fine, but I knew him for almost 2 years... so I think he probably assumed I already knew, or I just didn't care. That's what I mean, haha. :-)

That's a relief, I must say. I heard some horror stories of folks working in switzerland (zürich in particular), where some even get death threats. That's some seriously scary stuff, but thankfully, none of them got attacked. Maybe it's really just hot air.

Oh wow. Never heard of something like that. But it definitely sounds like hot air.

But unfortunately, there's no doubt that anti-German xenophobia *is* a thing in Switzerland, fueled by a number of factors, some having some merit, most being completely ridiculous.

In day to day live I really don't see any of that, but it's those moments when you read online what some of those people really think that I ask myself what the fuck is going on.

Yes me too.

You should watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWQCFwDTU3A

That's where I found out about the death threats myself. It might be possible that it only occurs relatively rarely, but still, I find that quite terrible.

I'm afraid there's some truth behind that, but quite frankly, insulting an entire nation for something the majority isn't responsible is essentially like.. well, you guessed it, calling a german ""nazi"". I find it despicable and the lack of respect really doesn't prove their point. Furthermore, germany *is*, in contrast to switzerland, a big country, and as it is usually the case, big countries have big asortments of diverse cultures. Fascists are the absolute minority here, yet they tend to be the loudest. It's truly tiring to hear the same b*llshit again and again. And yeah, austerity and such. But tell miss Merkel about that. :-)

When you talk online, you can be either a honest soul, or an anonymous coward... And being an anonymous coward allows you to say things you'd otherwise not dare to say, so I definitely understand that. Nevertheless it'd make them cowards to say something like that... (i'm not an angel either and I don't claim to be, so no worries).

Yes I completely agree, that's why I wrote unfortunately and called their arguments ridiculous. But to be fair, the nazi argument is not one that I've ever heard anywhere besides some youtube comment. But then again I'm not German so I wouldn't hear most of the bullshit directed at them.

That's a whole lotta truth right there. However, it seems that most of them are young, maybe without much experience, and simply gathered their information from the wrong (and likely biased) sources.
