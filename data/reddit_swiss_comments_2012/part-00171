There are three official languages. They are German, French and Italian.

Whereas most Germans would find understanding Swiss German a difficult task, luckily *German* German (or High German) is understood by all Swiss German speakers. The country is composed of around 40% foreigners though, so if English is your only language it won't be THAT difficult to get around. However, the locals will certainly appreciate you trying to speak their language.

The general attitude of the people is quite subdued. On public transport you won't often find people striking up conversations with others; instead you'll find people keeping to themselves and their smartphones.

First, for the guitar: as fischersfritz said, ricardo.ch can offer a good deal (I bought a Fender Squier 5 string bass guitar for 100 CHF there).
Alternatively, if you'd like to try the guitar without traveling across the country, you have the Dépôt-Vente (http://www.swissguide.ch/fr/Musique/Lausanne/347223_prokofieffivan.html)

Weather: If I remember well, we had an astonishing -15°C last February. It's winter. You can go and ski until May but from March the temperatures are above 10°C usually.

I think the beer part has been answered except to say that you can buy 0.5 CHF beer at Denner (Gralsburg) which is still drinkable ^^. A bread (not toast) will be between 1.2 and 5 I guess for 500gr. At Denner you can also have milk in two-liter packs for about 2 CHF (can't remember well now).

I don't know anything regarding electronic cigarettes except that you buy them in pharmacy.

If you're drunk on the street it's ok as long as you don't shit anyone: not too much noise, no car-jacking, you get the point. If you pass out on the street, someone might call the cops and ambulance. You'll go in hospital and I've heard it's quite expensing. About weed in the parks I'm not sure: policeman already came to me while smoking and didn't say more than ""be careful"", but friends had to go to the station signing stuff and pay something. Smoking inside a bar is forbidden everywhere, but at home, cigarettes or weed isn't a problem (smoked in a dozen flats, never heard a complain. Might even be fully legal).

Tips at bar or restaurant are not required at all, and have to be deserved by the waiter/ess. Three kisses is for friends (if you're a male only females, if female it's everyone except special case). Shake hand if you're not sure or in male-make interaction or with olders, boss, etc.
I don't care a shit about eye-contact and go for the tutoyement as soon as possible but never in a hierarchy (but they might ask you to do it)
