You should look in a phone book).

After a week, if things aren't changing, send a letter to the commission and your landlord (the same letter). Be very specific in the letter. ""My problem is This and That, I've contacted X, got Y as an answer and here is the photographic evidence). *Always* send a registered letter. Warn the landlord that they are about to receive that letter. After a while, the commission will contact you and your landlord. The president will usually try to find a quick solution. If that doesn't work, he or she will ask 3 to 5 commissioners of your kanton to find a solution.

It's a long process and you won't like it. Don't call the police unless it's for a good reason , and of course don't use the emergency number. If your neighbors are being noisy after 10pm, it is ok to call them but they don't care about everything else. Hopefully calling the police once on them will fix the situation (or make it worst).
