- If you join, go for nothing less than officer rank. Being a soldier is boring, being a sub-officer is annoying in addition (I've been both). Or just stay a soldier and see the whole thing as a show put on for your amusement.
- Select a unit type you want to do and inform yourself about the physical requirements. Know what you want or you may end up in a office or some storage facility where you will get fat because of all the free food and play video games all day.
- Get in shape before your service! Especially if you are in a infantry combat unit. This is essential if you want to become an officer because being fitter than the rest of the guys means that you will be able to make better decisions under stress. It means that you will be able to help others in critical situations. And an officer always has to physically be able to match his soldiers in order to earn their respect. You can only get that advantage if you train hard for several months before your service starts.
- Walk in your shoes. 
- Staying in shape is much more of a challenge than getting in shape. What will you do after your military training ends?
- Watch [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DShDaJXK5qo) documentary. It's the most accurate ever done on the methods of military organisations and war as function of human society.

That's the whole point of the subreddits, by the way. Communities are built on shared interests. People passionate about a subject contribute good content, which attracts new subscribers or encourages users to be more active in that particular community. There are some highly active, low subscriber-count subreddits out there. What do they all have in common? Quality content relevant to the interests of the subscribers.

true,DeepBlueNemesis,bs,Beide Basel,"Unless it's something that would benefit you in your work life (ABC/NBC if you're a chemist for example) or you want a free upgrade to your driving licence (depending on what you do it ranges from C1E/D1E to DE (explanation see below)) or you think you should do it as a part of becoming an adult/full-fledged citizen I don't think you should do it if you have the choice. 

I was a driver/medic, which means I learned some first aid, got my driving licence pimped, met cool people and now I have to deal with the shitty WK (or *cours de répétition*) every year because they always place it at the worst possible time and apparently my sitting-around-and-devour-coffee skills are incredibly invaluable so they never allow me to delay my service. 

On the upside the easiest way for to complete strangers to bond is to talk about what happened to them in army. As long as you don't have many females and/or people-who-always-want-to-1-up-your-story around it can be a pretty fun conversation. 

(C1 means up to 7.5 tons, D1 up to 17 ppl including driver, E means you can drive any trailer your vehicle is legally able to pull (as opposed to just B which means up to 3.5t/9ppl/1t trailer max) while D means you can drive pretty much anything that doesn't require a special permission)
