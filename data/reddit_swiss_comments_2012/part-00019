Most people say to learn regular German first. Swiss German is only a spoken language, not a written one (they write in high German here) so finding resources to learn it can be difficult. High German is generally used in careers/business/etc. and if you learn the basics of German first you'll have a pretty good foundation for picking up Swiss German. 

Apart from the language thing, make sure you do your research with permits and visas and all that. Some of this stuff can vary from canton to canton. Englishforum.ch is a pretty good place to talk to other English speakers living in Switzerland.

* Look at the housing market. We rent (more so in cities but also in rural areas) and only buy if we intend to live in the house / flat for at least 10 years. Check out www.homegate.ch

Oh and two more questions: 1. How much do your highways cost? Do you have a toll system or a vignette like Romania, Austria, Hungary etc? I really can't remember...
2. How's the weather? Should I keep my winter tires on or can I mount the summer ones? (summer ones are more silent and fuesl-efficient)
