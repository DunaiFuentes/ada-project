&gt; The intent of the extradition treaty was to deal with serious organised crime and terrorism cases.

&gt; McKinnon comes under neither heading, nor did the NatWest employees extradited for shenanigans over Enron.

&gt; Britain should drop this treaty immediately, and refuse any extradition request other than for terrorist crimes.

The twins were born either side of midnight on the boundary that determines what school year they get placed in.  This was bound to happen eventually.

The way the article is written, it sounds as though the government is unwilling to compromise, that they've simply put their foot down and said that the policy is absolute.

Have they?  Hell no.  The spokesman essentially said *Er, they've only just been born.  We'll sort it out when they are old enough to go to school.*  That's not at all the bureaucratic inept government nonsense the Daily Mail wants to portray though, is it?  So we get told that they are going to be split up, talks of ""no leeway"" (yes, *for recording the date of birth*, not the school placement), ""it's such a shame"", talk about ""fighting for four years"", moving abroad, and so on.

Nobody, nowhere, has said that these kids should be split up.  It's manufactured outrage, the latest Two Minute Hate from the Daily Heil.
