&gt;""The BBC does not wish to be directly associated with the collection of the TV licence so it contracts out the collection to the Capita group""

Incorrect. This outsourcing was forced by regulations making the BBC outsource 20% of it's budget. The BBC has no problem being associated with the license fee. The BBC is *proud* to be associated with the license fee.

&gt;BBC/TVL prosecutes 150,000 people annually but a hard core of maybe a million put up a finger and get away with it. Most of those who get done are women and on benefits.

What? Is there a reliable source for this data?

&gt;No alternative to the licence fee has ever been considered by the BBC or governments of either political stripe. The licence fee keeps the BBC entirely dependent on government for both its level and renewal. Politicians of all parties hence tend to defend it. However polls show a growing majority of the population objects to the fee.

Alternatives are being considered all the time. No other arrangement has been shown to provide both autonomy from corporations and the government nearly so well.

The BBC is kept independent from the government by the existence of the BBC Trust and Board Of Governors.

Polls have consistently shown that the public don't like the license fee - but love the BBC and its independence. People always want to have their cake and eat it.

&gt;The fee is flagrantly contradictory to the supposed right in the European Convention on Human Rights (adapted  by the UK) to receive information without interference.

No it isn't.

&gt;BBC/Guardian propagands notwithstanding, Rupert Murdoch is the licence fee’s biggest fan. Although he knows perfectly well that the entire idea is ridiculous, it suits him that Sky is the only national subscription TV platform

How old is this article? What about Virgin media?

&gt;11. Other than the uniquitous BBC services, public broadcasting meanwhile hardly exists in the UK (unless you count Big Brother) and there is no access or money or even frequencies for anyone who wants to compete with the BBC. The BBC has ahieved the status of a secular religion (maybe a little like the NHS) where it has successfully confused its own identity with something the public understands to be desireable. Unfortunately, the BBC has long been an obstacles to a diverse public broadcasting culture in the UK, through its monopoly of the funds not to mention its monopoly of the frequency spectrum (half the VHF band) (and obstruction of competition).

This is the fault of the government not freeing up those TV frequencies. There are many many local independent radio stations around the country and on the web.

&gt;The BBC tells us frequently that it is a beloved British institution - so why is it so terrified of asking viewers and listeners to pay voluntarily, like every other media company?

Because people generally don't know what's good for them. They don't want to pay the fee - but don't really realise what would happen to TV in this country if they didn't - i.e. wall-to-wall advertising and lowest-common-denominator content.

true,ukchris,null,null,"When MPs heard about Damian Green's arrest, many of us asked ourselves the same question: ""When did it become a crime to hold the Government to account?""

Throwing a spotlight on information the Government would rather keep hidden is an essential part of our democracy. And when dealing with an administration legendary for its secrecy, you increasingly have to rely on whistle-blowers to see the full picture.

I have written at greater length on this issue in today's Telegraph, as you can read at http://ww.tinyurl.com/damiangreen

This unprecedented arrest is a wake-up call. We must save our broken democracy.

Best wishes
