true,Hermel,null,null,"I'm Swiss, living in Zurich (German part). I've visited America two times (west coast), so I'll try to describe the differences that caught my eye:

* Public transport: Switzerland has one of the best public transport systems in the world. I don't own a car and I don't miss it. In Zurich, most people go to work by bike or tram. Our company doesn't even have a parking lot.
* Less warnings: when visiting the US, I saw much more warning signs than anywhere else before. It's kind of a contradiction to the reputation as bastion of freedom.
* The Swiss state seems to play a more pervasive role. It's normal to have a national id card. The government knows where you live and you are a number in some database.
* Even though we are more tolerant to inequalities than the Germans, we are less so than the Americans. You shouldn't show off your wealth in Switzerland, that's considered poor taste. A nice example my grand-mother told me is that of a family that bought the exact same car twice and made sure to never park both of them outside at the same time so their neighbours didn't notice they had the luxury of two cars. This was quite a few decades ago, but I like it as an illustration of that attitude nonetheless.
* Mobility in general is higher in America. The Swiss don't move around as much as Americans. Also, they don't change their job as often and as lightly as Americans. Labour law in general is more socialistic than in the US (e.g. 4 weeks of paid vacation mandatory), but less socialistic than in other European countries (companies are free to fire people if they want to).
* As people move around less often, they also change their friends less often which might make it harder for someone coming from the outside to find friends and to get integrated.
* Swiss coming back from holidays America often say ""everthing is much larger there"". It's true. It applies to cornflake packages, cars, streets, people, buildings, etc. I seems to me that in the US, bigger is much more often equated with better, especially when it comes to food.
* Swiss democracy: people are often complaining about 'Bern', but deep inside, most of us are quite proud of our system. The reputation of bureaucrats is to be lazy and complicated, but actually we have a quite efficient administration (I'd say more efficient than many global corporations). Political decisions take a long time, but they tend to be well-balanced.
* Swiss prejudices against Americans: self-confident/arrogant, direct/undiplomatic, outgoing. In the eyes of many Europeans, the US as a country behaves a little like an adolescent compared to the aged European countries.

All in all, I can say that I like my life here in Switzerland a lot. Of all the countries I've visited, I think it is the one that suits me best.

What's your profession? Do you plan to move here on your own or with your family?

Regarding taxes: The US is the only country in the world that taxes its citizens even when they live abroad ([source](http://bern.usembassy.gov/federal_tax_law.html)). There's a tax agreement with Switzerland to prevent double-taxation, but I've heard that if Switzerland taxes you lower than the US, you will have to pay the difference to the US.

Regarding pervasiveness of the state and such, the USA may not have a national ID card, but without a state ID or drivers' license, you won't get too far.  The states also keep a database of where you live too for tax reasons.

I'm pretty anti-socialism, I know there's no national healthcare program in Switzerland as well, but insurance is mandatory.  Some of the programs in the US are getting out of hand, I don't know how they are there so I'd like to learn.  I hear welfare programs are at the canton level.  I just keep hearing Switzerland is a bastion of libertarianism in Europe, but this isn't my only reason for liking it there.

true,shapul,vd,Vaud,"I'm not swiss but I used to live there (in Lausanne) for 7 years. Here are some of what I learned: 

*Switzerland is small. Within a few hours you can drive from one side of the country to the other side. 

*Switzerland is big. Within a few hours you leave a culture and arrive in a different culture. Climate changes, language changes and perspective of the people about life changes. 

*Swiss are multilingual. Knowing 3 or 4 languanges is common. 

*Switzerland is expensive but the average income is high. Swiss are obssessed with quality. Nobody likes dirt cheap products that would break fast. Thus you don't find such products in the shops at all. 

*The swiss love outdoors. They are very fit (not mascular, just healthy fit). 

*TV is not that important for the swiss. Although you do have a good selection of TV channels (over 150 with basic cable subscription) many swiss prefer not to have a TV at all. They prefer spending their time reading, going to bars and pub with the firends or hike or ski. 

*Swiss read a lot of newspapers. They are generally well informed about world events and politics. 

*Country is small so the job market is also small. On the other hand the competition is also lower. If you are an expert, you either find a job very fast (no competition) or you don't find it at all (small job marekt). 

*Swiss cities are very clean, administration is efficient and most regulations are very logical. It is expected as the whole system is based on direct democracy. 

*Swiss like technology. They like tools and building stuff. They like good quality tools. There are lots of comparatively large shops selling high quality tools. This is the country of watchmakers.

*School system and universities are of very high quality. Swiss kids like science and technology. 

*The last but not the least: mountains. Magical mountains. Hiking in the summer, ski in the winter. I live in Oregon now but Switzerland was something else.

First of all, whenever I travel I love coming back to Switzerland after some time, just because of the good Public Transport, the clean streets and cities and the really nice food here. (Not that I don't like travelling, but I think we are really spoiled in Switzerland when it comes to stuff like that).

There is basically only one thing I don't like in Switzerland. Swiss people are not as sociable as people from the United States. I went to Califronia for a month and basically everyone was friendly there and wanted to talk to you, asked me stuff about my country and wanted to hang out. Here in Switzerland it's a lot harder to find some friends. Not that people wouldn't want to be friends with everyone, but it's pretty easy to find people on other places than Work, School and stuff like that.

There are pubs in Zurich that you will go in and there will be almost 90% of people in there speaking English, and the chances are that the other 10% will speak English as a second language anyway. Zurich rugby club is all done in English, and there are 2 English speaking schools in Zurich it's self. I am yet to decide if I think it's a bad thing or not.
