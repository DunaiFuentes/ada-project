true,shinnen,zh,Zürich,"Might have been better off posting this to /r/trees but here goes.

I have no idea on the law-side of things, I would probably assume that selling is illegal now, no idea about growing. 

Socially, I've seen people smoke it everywhere, with Securitas and Police ignoring them pretty much. The issue of decriminalisation reached referendum a couple of years back, losing 48:52 I believe. It's only a matter of time before it's decriminalised in Switzerland. 

Local breweries might sell Hemp Beer, basically beer favoured with Cannabis which contains minute amounts of THC. In the shops you can also buy C-Ice, an ice tea favoured with cannabis : http://www.c-ice.com/

So just from those two examples, and the fact that you most likely won't get asked to put out your spliff if you smoked up in a public location (as long as it's quiet: local park etc.) I would say it's quite socially accepted. 

I still wouldn't share it openly with your coworkers unless they're all young guys who would likely smoke. 

Still worth asking in /r/trees, although I don't subscribe, from a couple of posts, I've seen some Swiss guys there.",0,1287226406,null,0,false,0,c12gmgx,t3_ds0bg,t1_c12gmgx,t3_ds0bg,null,1426518827,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3
true,urbanradar,bs,Basel-Stadt,"Buying/selling, personal use and home-growing are all illegal. Legalization was put up to the popular vote two years ago, but failed to pass (with 63% of people against it). That said, punishments for being caught with personal use amounts of cannabis aren't that tough, generally you'll just get a fine. Federal law also explicitly permits police and courts to let you off with a warning if they think it appropriate to do so and only small amounts are involved.

As far as the social thing is concerned, I suppose it kind of depends where in Switzerland you are. Some of the rural cantons tend to be a little more conservative, but people in and around the cities are generally pretty easy-going. I live in Basel and I've never really experienced anyone being seriously judged for smoking up casually. (If you're constantly stoned and useless, that might be different.)

According to Wikipedia, a third of men under 40 in Switzerland and a quarter of women in the same age bracket have consumed cannabis, with about 500'000 people in total still smoking cannabis regularly.

So about whether you'd want to share that information with your co-workers... I'd say that depends on your co-workers. Use your own good judgment. Might want to avoid it they seem like uptight people or if they're aged over 50 or something. But generally, the social stigma cannabis carries isn't really all that strong, so I wouldn't worry too much.

As for where to get it: Dunno. Again, depends where you are. In many places, there are dealers who drive around in their cars all day and can come meet you anywhere as long as you have their mobile number and they know you. They tend to charge too much though, and you can never be sure about the quality. My advice to you is to make some local friends and ask them. In my experience, most people who smoke regularly get their stuff through personal acquaintances, rather than full-time dealers.
