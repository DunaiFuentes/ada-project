true,billcube,ge,Genève,"To be even more precise : 

* When you arrive at Geneva airport, between baggage claims and customs, are ticket machines, they give free tickets for the Geneva public transport system.

* At the train station (go left after baggage claims), you'll find the ticket vending machine. Choose a City-ticket for Genève-&gt;Lausanne (and not Geneva-airport-&gt;Lausanne, you already have the ticket for Geneva-Airport-&gt;Geneva). With this city ticket (CHF 26.80), you'll have the train ride and a day ticket for Lausanne.

Didn't realise op wanted to go straight from the Airport to Lausanne, I just presumed it was some kind of day trip to Lausanne from a trip to Geneva.

But yeah in which case this is a great option for going between the 2 cities!",0,1289249889,null,0,false,0,c14wmv2,t3_e32ft,t1_c14wmv2,t1_c14whwt,null,1426560833,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
true,eltower,vd,Vaud,"Just to say hello from Lausanne!

Trains are very frequent between GVA and Lausanne and you get the ticket for 25CHF, 2nd class one way without a half-fare reduction at the station which is right next to the airport.

No sweat with a big bag, if the train is really crowded just sit on it in the corridor in front of the door.

Enjoy Lausanne! Although as of yesterday the weather is shite.
