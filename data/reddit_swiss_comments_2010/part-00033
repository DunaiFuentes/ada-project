I can tell you as a student that the going is rough and if you can't be there in person to harass the real estate agents then you're in trouble.

It's a strange combination of luck and perseverance. I think you will find more chances if you intensify your search during the summer months and the months leading to it, and starting now until February/March, which is when a lot of exchange students move out. Some of them are sitting on really neat properties which again proves the point that it's as much a roulette as it is skill in searching.

I personally know at least 5 or 6 students who are crashing on couches at mate's places because they simply cannot find anything (same problem of being one of 50 on a list).

I can only speculate that aiming at a higher price bracket will get your more luck and less competition and other than that, godspeed and good hunting sir.

I cannot personally help you, I'm afraid, since I'm thankfully set for the full 5 years of my studies in a studio at a dorm. Other than that, all I can say is 'Adieu, ça va ou bien?' from a fellow Lausanne redditor as we are far and few.

You'll *have* to be able to leave work in the middle of the day and run visit the apartments you see on the Internet. It's a pain in the ass I know and it will take time but there's not much choice unless you have friends in real-estate.


I'll highly recommend you also keep an eye on the real-estate section of newspapers. The less people see the ad, the more chances you have of snatching it.


If you want cheap rent and availability, find a place in the surrounding area.

A non-cheap but easy way to get a place is to sign a contract on a yet-to-be finished building. For some reason people don't rush on those (OK so new places cost more).


Talk with your boss, you will have to take 2-hour breaks in order to visit places and harass the gérances. Also don't be afraid to lie a bit on the forms, besides they ask stuff that's way out of line most of the time.


Good luck and most of all be patient. It's perfectly normal to have to spend +6 months to find a place.

1 - Integration is a long process. It happens over generations, not weeks. Only a few decades ago, right-wing politicians panicked over the large number of Italians in Switzerland, who were going to destroy our society because they would never, ever learn German and accept our values. Nowadays, Italians in Switzerland are a non-issue even for the SVP.

2 - Integration has to go both ways. I think it is reasonable and sensible to expect people coming here to learn German and to abide our laws, but you also need to provide better means of integration and of learning to newcomers. How are you going to integrate into a society if they are on the whole completely unwilling to accept you for the person you are? Also, to integrate into a society is not to completely abandon your own culture and ways: You can expect a Turk or Albanian coming to Switzerland to immediately turn into a stereotypical Swiss person no more than you could expect a Swiss person moving to Albania to immediately turn into a stereotypical Albanian.

3 - Once you take social standing, education, age and income into consideration, foreigners are no more and no less criminal than Swiss citizens. The actual problems we have in this country -- and despite all the panicking, things are going pretty well for us -- are not problems of culture or nationality, but problems of social standing. The SVP simply provides scapegoats to increase their own power and to cover up the actual issues.

As mentioned in another comment, integration is normally sucessful and quite efficient in Switzerland. We integrate many thousands of foreigners every year. What I wanted to point out is that we cannot take it for granted that integration works well. It requires effort from both the immigrants and the citizens. Multiculturalism can work, but it is not only an asset, it also comes with costs and problems. And these are often neglected by the left which plays into the hands of the right who can exploit this with their simplistic recipes.
