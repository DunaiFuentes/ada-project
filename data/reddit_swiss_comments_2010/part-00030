true,shinnen,zh,Zürich,"Yeah big bag should be fine, the trains are pretty accommodating and comfortable generally. There are some wider trains and the double-decker trains aren't as wide but much more comfortable, so you'll be fine either way! 

For timetables and prices look at http://www.sbb.ch and you can set the language to English. Travel time is between about half an hour to 45 mins depending on which train you get...

You just buy the ticket on the day at a machine located on or near the platforms, you can set the language to English there too by pressing the British flag (lol don't mean to be patronising) then just set destination to Lausanne (obviously), select the number of tickets you want and you're good to go. EDIT: FYI you can pay in Euros, Francs or by card.

When you're in Lausanne, you can buy a Mobilis day-ticket for like 10 francs which lets you use all the public transport in and around Lausanne for 24 hours. 

Erm that's about all the info I can think of... I'm in Lausanne btw so if there are any more questions just let me know!",0,1289247483,null,0,false,0,c14wgmk,t3_e32ft,t1_c14wgmk,t3_e32ft,null,1426560753,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3
true,Interstellar_Cupcake,null,null,"Seconded. Just buy the ticket at the airport/train station, since a reservation is not needed. As for luggage, you can bring as many suitcases as you want to onto the train, there are no limitations, as long as you stay in Switzerland of course. Surrounding countries have other policies on reservations as well as luggage.  ",0,1289247652,null,0,false,0,c14wh1i,t3_e32ft,t1_c14wh1i,t1_c14wek7,null,1426560758,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3
