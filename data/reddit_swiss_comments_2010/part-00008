The uni is the best method of finding english speaking social events, my sister was there and she took me to a bunch of events with cool people, but im sure if you ask around someone will hook you up.  All the people speak French, but you'll find if you force them a lot speak English.  There's an english library near rue de berne that has community postings for expat events.  There's some Irish pubs in the old town for english speakers that are good for meeting people.  All the African dudes selling weed around L'usine speak english and they have weed which is always a plus in my book.  If you've got nothing to do all day just walk around town and keep your eyes and ears open and hunt for people to make a connection with.
