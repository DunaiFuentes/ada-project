true,Vlip,be,Bern,"The only redeeming value of Interlaken is its location.
It's an ugly little town filled to the brink with tourists and priced accordingly.
It is superbly located if you want to make excursions in the mountains though.

Thun is 20 minutes away from Interlaken by train and is a superbe little town with an exquisite lac view on the alps (with one of the most beautiful swimming pool / lac beach in Switzerland).

Bern is 40 minutes away from Interlaken, is the capital, has a beautiful medieval town center. You can visit the federal palace there for free.
Taking a swim in the river via the marzili pool (also free) is recommended if you are an okish swimmer, it's quite an experience.

Morat nearby is a fantastic little medieval town with it's old walls. Scenery is nice as it's on the Morat lac too.

true,Vlip,be,Bern,"I'd recommend stopping at least a day in Bern, you can visit Thun on your way to Interlaken for the Mountain fun.

Trains are the recommended way to travel in Switzerland. It's fast and reliable. It ain't particularly cheap though.

Here are the foreigners offers.
Which one to use depends on how much train trips you are planning to do. At the very least take the Half Fare card, it costs 99CHF and I'd be very surprised if you don't save that much money even for the back and forth trip from Geneva to Interlaken.",0,1281078869,null,0,false,0,c0w3vc8,t3_cxkdx,t1_c0w3vc8,t1_c0w2sur,null,1426410772,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

true,telllos,vd,Vaud,"Here is my advise if you want to go to interlaken from geneva.

Take a train from geneva to montreux. in montreux take the [MOB](http://www.goldenpass.ch/default.asp?Language=EN) to spiez from spiez take a boat to interlaken.

Vlip is right, Interlaken is not that pretty. It's packed with toursits.

Bern is a nice town to visit. As well as Basel.

I'm Swiss and just spent my holiday showing the country to my wife's familly.

One thing I quite liked was the visite of [the cailler factory](http://www.cailler.ch/en/Chocolaterie.aspx) in Broc. With chocolat tasting at the end of the visit!

The best thing when visiting Switzerland by train is to get a day card from a city hall (commune). With that card you can take most of the public transport in the country, boat, train, buses.",0,1281518632,null,0,true,0,c0whz39,t3_cxkdx,t1_c0whz39,t3_cxkdx,null,1426417397,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
