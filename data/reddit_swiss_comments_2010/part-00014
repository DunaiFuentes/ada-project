2. The majority yes, but see 3). Some take a year off in between for travelling and stuff, but it's not very common.
3. Most of the men go to the military between school (called a Gymnasium or Kantonsschule) and university. In most cases this means +1 year until they start university.
4. I didn't find any statistical data on this, but I think it depends a lot on the field of study. Probably 23-25.
5. In the middle of the year, in september. 

However, there are many people who start in one field of study and switch later, so the age average goes up a bit.

2. Yes, most go directly to college if they do so at all.

Not to write off your questions, but really, don't worry about people being around your age. ETH has a very vibrant body of international students, and age is somehow never a problem. You'll make friends in no time (the international students don't know anybody either! :) ). There's the stereotype that Swiss people are harder to make friends with, but I think this is a bit exaggerated, I find they're quite sociable in a multi-cultural environment.

To give you an idea of my experience so far: I know people from 22 to 30, and I'd say the distribution is centered around 23-24 (I'm doing my MSc).
