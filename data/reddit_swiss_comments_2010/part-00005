true,meeeow,null,null,"Hey, I've been in Switzerland for a few weeks, I'm from the UK and am going back soon but I really wish I didn't have to :(

Here are the things I noticed the most:

- Public transport kicks ass. There are buses and trains all the time and depending of where you live they come very often. They run late and are very comfortable and fast.

- It's a cultural country. People don't watch TV, they read books, visit museums or film festivals and socialise.

- They like quality and they pay for it. Living here is expensive, very expensive (though salaries also are higher than average) However, you don't get bad quality products. Where I noticed the most is food, even the budget supermarket brands are good.

- There is a lot to do. THey have a great nightlife, loads of bands come through here, there's always something to do.

- Multicultural. You can get foods from anywhere, anywhere. Also, seems like anyone under the age of 40 speakes english. They appreciate the french though, I really am trying to improve mine so I won't be scared of going out, etc

- People are healthy. They enjoy the outdoors, good healthy food and looking after themselves. I haven't seen one obese person yet.

The stuff that can be a problem:

- Everything shuts early. They have very arbitrary closing times for stores, markets and so on. For instance, most places stay open until 7pm on weekdays. Apart from Thursday when they shut at 7:30. Some bigger places like Manor close at 8 (Or 8:30, cant remember now,) on Saturdays while everywhere else closes at 5. NOTHING opens on a Sunday. If you grow up with it, no worries. If you're used to 24 hours convinience shops, late night malls, etc it can be annoying. It can be particularly annoying when you need a paracetamol or a condom late a night for example :P

- In some places, people seem to be bored of foreigners and are not very patient and welcoming as a result. Take Geneva, the official figures is that 60% of the population is not Swiss. You can see what I mean. Understandable as it might be, it can be hard to deal with and to be perceived as a nuisense.

- I feel the community as a whole is very closed and hard to break into. Swiss seem to be a creature of habit, anything that disturbs their order of doing things is not imediatly liked. Sometimes I very much feel like I'm in highschool, and certain bars and places are only for a certain kind of people and crews. Like if you go somewhere people will look at you and think 'What is someone like YOU doing here?'

- (On the other hand however, if you're not shy, most people tend to respond well to it :)

- EVERYTHING is expensive. Even if you want to order a bloody pizza be prepared to fork out at least 30 francs. I appreciate the desire for quality but sometimes you just want something cheap :P These are very hard to find.

- They are proud. And of course, why shouldn't they be. They have an incredible country which runs smoothly. But this can make many Swiss close-minded an unwelcoming. There is deffinetly a sense of superiority that can be seen and many seem to have the attitude that 'Switzerland is awesome, no other culture can teach anything uself or as good'. Also if you make any criticism about anything, even if you're poking fun, be ready for a long discussion :P Not everybody is like this, but there is enough of it for it to be noticible.

Overall, the country is beautiful, there's plenty to do, transport is absolutely incredible (I cannot highlight this enough, you simply don't need a car unless you live in the country-side), the people are for the most part intelligent. I think the only thing to be weary of is that sometimes it seems like there's two sides to this country: the warm, welcoming, open-minded one and the closed, traditional side that doesn't want to change or see anything different. Take a while getting used to this... I really can't describe it any other way than that, sorry it isn't clearer what I meant.

Sooo, come here as soon as you can. I'd give an eye and a leg to get out of the UK and live here.

I know I'm a month late but I just joined this subreddit today. (Aussie-born but been living in Switzerland since im 4 yo.)

just wanted to tell you about a pretty good website where you can compare insurance pricing of different companies in switzerland. Haven't checked it in English but this is the [English version of comparis.](http://en.comparis.ch/comparis/default.aspx).

My cousin moved from London to Switzerland in April 09 and seems to be loving it. I'll see if I can get him on here.
