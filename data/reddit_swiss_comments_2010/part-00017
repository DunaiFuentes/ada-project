true,mattch,null,null,"hey!
depends what you're into visit-wise: sporty stuff, museums, etc? The Olympic museum is really good, and the lakefront at Ouchy is very pretty. 
Food-wise, there's a really nice tea-room called la Coccinelle on Rue Pichard, and a great little resto called the Café de Grancy just below the station (booking required, ask for a seat on the terrasse). There's also a really good hot chocolate place up near the cathedral, but it might be a bit hot for that!

On your way to Valais, try the Chateau de Chillon for two reasons: * a) it's beautiful to look at and * b) you will never see that many Japanese people outside Japan :)

In Valais there's loads of sporty stuff to do (http://www.parc-aventure.ch, for example if you like swinging about in trees; or there are loads of via ferrata, mountain bike trails, etc.).

feel free to pm me if you want to have a chat or if there's anything specific you're into!
