true,biwook,null,null,"Hi there!

There are so many many things to do and explore in Switzerland, especially compared to the size of the country.

How much time do you have here? What is your budget? Whatever your budget is, it'll certainly be raped to death within days of your arrival, but there are quite a few things you can do to save money:

* **Transportation**: The public transports are very developed, effective and comfortable, you can get anywhere by train easily. If you plan to move around more than a little bit, get a swiss half fare card (half price on all public transport - 150.- for one year, you'll get the value back in like 2 train trips already), or a swiss pass thingie (unlimited free transport for 4 / 8, etc... days, I believe it's about 380.- for 8 days?). Also, insider tip: if you're under 25, get the ""platform 7"" card, you'll travel for free after 7pm for one year only 99 francs :)

* **Housing**: Hotels are quite expensive, but it's Switzerland and the hostels are very clean, comfortable and quite affordable. Campings as well. And finally, consider Couchsurfing, you'll get free housing, new friends and local advice!

* **Food**: probably what will shock you the most: fucking expensive everywhere, and practically no fast food / take away. Don't be scared to just go to supermarket, get a pic nic and eat in a park! (swiss way: bread, cheese and sausage!). You're not allowed to leave the country without having eaten a CHEESE FONDUE!

Now, for some directions:

* For hiking, the area around Interlaken has so many options and things to see / do that your mind will explode: gorges, caves, waterfalls, very high mountains, lakes, and of course chalets everywhere! Interlaken itself is boring, but excellent base camp! Google those to get an idea: Jungfraujoch (fucking expensive but possibly the most beautiful things you'll see in your life), Lauterbrunnen, Grindelwald, Aareschlucht, Trummelbach (no excuse to miss it, a canyon so deep that no light reach the bottom, and full of crazy glacier waterfalls), and literally dozens of things you'll discover once you're there.
* Pretty cities of Switzerland: Bern, the capital, is a beautiful medieval city, very well conserved. You'll visit it in one day though, it's tiny (big village?). Zurich is much more metropolitan and has an awesome historic center with loads of cool shop and cute little streets. Avoid Geneva, it is plain boring city to visit (a few museums maybe?). There are also a lot of pretty little towns a bit everywhere, with cute historic centers and all this shit. Google for: Sion, Murten, Gruyères, Schaffhausen, Fribourg, .........). Forgot Luzern too, it's kitsch as hell!
* The southern part near Italy (Ticino) is beautiful, although I don't know it much.
* The Western part too, Google for Montreux, Lavaux, Chillon castle (my mom works there, say hi to her!).
* Great, you've an overview of about 1% of the stuff to see in Switzerland. Get a guide book, bitch!

Also, if you want to get out of Switzerland, Paris and Milan are just 3 hours away by train.
