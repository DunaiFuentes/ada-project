  * Trotz Kosovo bleiben die Grünen für mich eine Friedenspartei. Der Kosovokrieg war eine harte Entscheidung für die Partei, aber rückblickend richtig und notwendig. Vor einigen Wochen habe ich mit einigen Kosovaren gesprochen, die an der selben Uni wie ich ein Masterstudium machen. Für die geht der Aufbau ihres Landes nicht schnell genug voran, aber das liegt leider auch an der UN, die vieles immer noch blockieren. Das sie kein vollwertiges Mitglied sind verhindert ganz praktische Dinge: ein Programmierer hatte bspw. Probleme in ein Microsoft Developer Programm aufgenommen zu werden. Die Handys haben je nach Anbieter unterschiedlich Vorwahlen (z.B. Monaco) weil der Kosovo keine eigene Vorwahl bekommt ... Was ich sagen will ist, dass ein UN-Mandat 1999 ziemlich ausgeschlossen war - leider! Das der Krieg notwendig war - auch leider! Die Grünen haben es sich damals schwer gemacht mit dieser Entscheidung. Es ist mir lieber eine Regierung zu haben die sich vor jedem Einsatz selbst zerfleischt, als eine Merkel mit der wir damals in den Irak marschiert wären, und die heute ein kriminell-expanisive Rüstungspolitik betreibt.

  * Es geht nicht nur um Hanflieberalisierung, sondern einen komplett neuen Ansatz in der Drogenpolitik - und zwar weltweit. Leider wird da eine Minderheitsbeteiligung in der Regierung nichts bewirken. Das ist ein Thema bei dem noch viel Überzeugungsarbeit geleistet werden muss. In den Medien, in der Bevölkerung, bei Politikern aus allen Parteien. Der jetzige Ansatz ist so  falsch in allen Aspekten, es werden Menschenleben zerstört und kriminelle Banden finanziert. Ich hoffe irgendwie auf einen Wandel in Südamerika, der über Spanien/Frankreich nach Europa kommt... Bis dahin bleibt es so viele Menschen zu überzeugen, dass diese die Mehrheit stellen - Leider.

  * In der Stärkung der Bürgerrechte haben die Grünen leider versagt. Zu ihrer Verteidigung bleibt der Zeitgeist nach dem 11. September zu erwähnen. An diesem Punkt bin ich ziemlich froh, dass es die Piraten gibt. Ich habe sie bei der letzten BTW (also vor dem ganzen Hype) gewählt. Ein bisschen habe ich das Gefühl das die Gesellschaft bei diesem Thema sensibler geworden ist. Persönlich tendiere ich deshalb dazu den Grünen im September wieder eine Chance zu geben ...

Otherwise, French isn't an official language of the Olympic Games because of the winning scores, the same way French isn't an official language of FIFA because of the French football team.

GDP of France: 2,608,699

Using more resources in absolute terms enables options that simply aren't possible for people using less[1], although it's hard to determine the exact difference that makes.

From the US' point Europe was a very very weird place. A place of constant trouble and instability. The US also had a troblesome relationship with the British Empire. At the end of WW2 Europe had destroyed itself and Russia was at the peak of its production capacity, as was the US. Russia was hurt badly in the war but still came out as the biggest force on the continent. 

Stalin couldn't be trusted. See the [X-article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Article) that describes extensively why the USSR can never be trusted.

The UK couldn't be trusted. Truman was outraged with both the UK and the USSR because of how the handled the [Greek civil war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Civil_War). This lead to the Truman doctrine which to this day plays out in Turkey. [AKP being outraged](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-analyzes-regional-impacts-of-egypt-coup-.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=50007&amp;NewsCatID=352) with Morsi and the *yandaş* being ousted? That was Obama instructing AKP to help out Morsi to establish a *soft Islamic state* in Egypt.

Þeir sem áður hafa fengið íslenskt ríkisfang með því skilyrði að þeir breyttu nafni sínu geta sótt um það til Þjóðskrár Íslands að fá að breyta nafni sínu til fyrra horfs, að hluta eða að öllu leyti. Sama gildir um niðja þeirra.

Honum er enn fremur heimilt að kenna sig til föður eða móður maka síns. Dæmi: Mary Smith giftist Jóni Jónssyni og Anne Baker giftist Pétri Ægissyni Thors.

Im not sure I understand this, but before WWII there were no independent states in the Reich, it was a single state.

&gt;And Isay that, when Germany reunited, east germans did not give up their independence to be ruled by west germans. It was more about two parts of a same nation reuniting after having been arbitrarely separated by outside forces. Am I right?

No, you are not entirely correct. What happened after the reunification was basically destroying the superior welfare and education system, selling everything the now vanished state owned to private organizations, it was basically looting by capitalism. The former citizens of the GDR lost a lot of wealth at this time and havent recovered until today. The youth fled into the west, the employers left too, leaving behind the wreck of a state with high unemployment, low birthrates, old population and all the other problems east European countries suffered after the iron curtain was lifted. Until today there is still a difference in incomes between east and west for example.

All GDR officials were sent into early retirement and were replaced with corrupt western counterparts who sold off property at the lowest prices, further leading to a decline in overall living standards.

The joke is, the western tax payer has been paying for that policy ever since.

To answer your question: We lost our economic independence to the capitalistic system. The reunification was demanded by the people though, even the constitution of western Germany which is still our constitution foresaw this development. 

We were divided by others, this is the difference to many other reunifications where the people themselves decided to strife for independence and separation in the first place.

However.

1. One reason why this is so that democracy on larger scale is possible. If we went purely by population Germany would have 17% of all seats with UK, France, Italy just behind with about 12%. This is half the seats in just four countries in a block of 28! While I would not say that the MEPs are controlled from above, they share the same background and similar election cycles. Think; Germany and privacy, France and Mediterranean countries with agriculture etc. They could boss around whatever they wish, as long as three of the countries above share the same mindset. Things would have been even worse before Poland joined. 
Basically this left most of the Union in side-lines. As it is, the big countries still lead, but at least they have to ask the opinion of smaller countries as well; we have enough seats that we matter.. at least a little. And yes, I'm biased. Having seat arrangements that aren't directly proportional but slightly screwed toward logarithmic is democractic as well.

2. The president of EP or the president of commission will never come out of Estonia, Finland or Greece. These two positions are directly tied to EP-scales, so it's a related topic. These are perks given to bigger countries. In it's part, it balances point 1.

3. Further, this problem (and solution!) isn't unique for EP but shared by most organisations with several states as members. In USA, they have the Senate to balance the tyranny of larger states (as well as splitting larger states into smaller units, which obviously isn't possible in EU). 

My bias might be showing, but a small country will never be worth more than a large one.

We decided not to take everything with us when we moved, only the most important things we would need, all stuffed into our old red Audi 80. The drive from France to Belgrade was long and arduous, but eventually we made it to outside our apartment. All of us were bursting for a piss, so my mum took us upstairs and then we'd begin unloading the car. 10 minutes later we came back down and the car was gone.  

Two things: luckily, my mum had taken her handbag. That would have been pretty awkward otherwise, without passports or money in unknown country.  Second, it wasn't so much that the car had gotten stolen, but especially the stuff INSIDE it. Clothes, my dad's favourite records (he could only take a few on the first ride), my Xbox and Gameboy :( .... I was pretty fucking furious.

We went to the police, who ""tried"" to find it to avoid an international diplomatic incident or something, but of course nothing was ever recovered and I like to think that somewhere in kosovo, a red Audi 80 still drives around with my level 100 mewtwo. The cops said the thieves had likely spotted our car at the boarder and followed us ever since. Lucky we didn't stop at a rest-stop, he said, otherwise we'd have been seriously stranded in northern Serbia somewhere.

Besides this story I didn't get to spend much time in Belgrade as I didn't live there in the end for other reasons. I did come for holidays though!

- Awesome zoo (for kids). You buy unsalted popcorn and feed everything from elephants to camels and bisons. Baby animals are let into a playzone where kids can wrestle baby bears, tigers, lions, wolves, etc. Also, there is a display of guinea pigs and rabbits - of course there are hundreds of the things. i suspect they feed them to the predators. There's a lynx that chases you along the fence, and a horny chimpanzee who swings along the chain link face, using his erect penis to make music (""DRRRRIIINNGGG"". I am not joking).

When the allies bombed the fuck out of Serbia, the Serbs couldn't afford to either fix them or even move the debris.  For teenage me, it was freaking awesome, but I understand that actually it was a pain. We went to Novi Sad (beautiful place) and the bridges were still gone, and a tunnel (I think? fuzzy memory#9.

Great hiking.  Don't lose your dog, he might get shot by farmers. Luckily even they can see golden retrievers are probably not a threat, but their guard dogs were less than impressed with that city boy ambling about. Scary big motherfuckers the size of a bear.

Plato was an awesome bar / internet cafe that was among the centres of the revolution against milosevic. I didn't really care too much about that at the time, but 32-player counterstrike LAN servers were the norm there, it was awesome. A bit too much de_aztec for my liking. I had my first sneaky beer there.  Also, I remember reading a book abuot the radio station B92, that were also somehow involved in anti-Milosevic movements.

Dzinzic got assassinated a couple of days before the easter holidays. When I went there, there were APCs driving around the town centre and, because serbs are all so fucking tall, 2m tall masked soldiers with AKs blocking certain streets. Made me jump out of my skin when i walked around the corner and just saw him staring at me.

Thanks to DRM etc it's probably a little less prevalent now, but 14 year old me had a field day with 1€ PC games. It was a dream come true.

As an Austrian it was great fun finding ""borrowed"" German words in Serbian, loanwords are really fun to figure out. Here's a few examples you can try: koštati, flaša, paktreger, šnicla, palačinka, štrikati, frtalj (my favourite), špigl, vešmašina, there's loads more.

To give you an idea of the sense of humour they have (had?) over there:

An American bomber is about to enter Serbian airspace. The target has so far been kept confidential.

""Red 1 this is command. Your are to target anything of importance in Kragujevac. Confirm, over.""

""Command this is Red 1. Please repeat the name of the city.""

""Red 1 this is command. Kragujevac.""

""Krag-, Kragudgev-. Please repeat.""

""Kragujevac""

""Kraagooveejatch. I don't get it, I can't understand it. repeat it again""

""Stand by"". There is silence on the other end as command obviously discusses the situation. Finally, the radio crackles back to live.

Grumpy cat rules. Grumpy cat will not be leave teh interwebs. This is an example of a social media campaign that will cater to internet dwellers just like ourselves. In terms of corners, that is propably the corner where we are most at home. Memes are for Pirates what Lederhosen are for the CSU, so to speak. We cannot change who we are. But as internet culture bleeds into RL mainstream, people's perception of this will hopefully change. This is just my personal interpretation

&gt; I think a lot of people voted for you in the beginning because it is indeed a new approach to politics. You constantly lost votes from that point on because people saw how your party was stunned by internal struggling and couldnt move forward. 

That is exactly the problem. We were moving forward all the time. The problem is indeed that the fails, bickering and personal quarrels generate distraction from other stuff that happens. Like when our people in the four state parliaments are working together, are influencing policy making, are working for more transparency etc etc, they generate very small interest and coverage. But when there is shitstorm because of some fail or mistake or dumb remark, it's suddenly everywhere and everyone knows about it. I now understand why the other parties keep most of their inner workings secret and try to say nothing wrong which leads to this special political diction most people find so appalling. 
I read somewhere that there is an inherent attention bias towards bad news, so that bad news are always more interesting than good news. I now tend to believe that.

In the light of the current situation, this rant by one of our representatives in the NRW parliament seems to be related to the issue http://www.carta.info/60602/die-piraten-machen-ja-nichts-zu-prism-und-tempora/

China does this all the time: ""we covered up the fact a major dairy company with Party connections has killed hundreds of babies with it's tainted milk formula because if we didn't hide this information we'd lose face during the Olympics"". Fuck anyone who thinks like this: if you don't want to be humiliated, don't do humiliating things and expect them to stay buried.

- Serbia has a history of producing great inventors, scientists, and thinkers. The most famous is probably Nikola Tesla. However, Pupin, Milanković, and Gopčević were also Serbian.
- Even Albert Einstein's wife, Mileva Einstein, was not only Serbian, but a mathematician, as well.
- Ivo Andrić, a prominent Serbian author, won a Nobel prize in literature. He donated all of the money to improve libraries. I strongly recommend the book to anyone who has a passing interest in the Balkans.
- Serbia's also very good at sports. From tennis (the world #1 in the world is currently Serbian), handball, waterpolo, volleyball to basktetball... (but everyone here still cares more about soccer. Our soccer team is like communism. It only looks good on paper.)
- This probably has something to do with Serbia having the second-tallest people in all of Europe.
- A third of the world's raspberries come from Serbia! :)
- Of the five Microsoft development centres in the world, one of them is in Belgrade.
- Despite a high unemployment rate, Serbia's economy has been seeing steady growth for the last 10 years, and 2013 is projected to be another good year.

**Historically**: Serbia has been a country in Central balkans for (I guess) about a 1000 years, been in conflict with the Byzantines and Ottomans, later Austria-Hungaria. Serbians are the orthodox south slavs and the most numerous ethnicity among south slavs. This, combined with the nationalists movements of 19th and 20th century, have resulted in dreams of unifying yugoslavs under one power, namely the Serbians. The dream came true during the 20th century, but was also destroyed in 1991 with the collapse of Yugoslavia. Serbians were the major force behind the federalist and restoration movement and thus have been in a bad light for the last 20 years, as they fought against Croats and mostly Bosniaks from braking free from Yugoslavia. So the recent history of Serbia has been a bloody one with 2 significant wars in last 20 years.

Today, Serbia is much more monoethnic, though the province of Vojvodina is still very much Hungarian and there are hundreds of thousands of Romas living in Serbia. Also, there's another Serbian country: In Bosnia and Herzogovina, a semi-autonomous region of Serbians.

**Economically**: Serbia was seriously damaged in the two wars, though not so much directly (as the fighting mostly occured on other territories), but mostly from long war and losing the economic connections with the rest of yugoslavia. Serbia is slowly moving towards the EU and unification, though there's quite some way to go. Serbia is considerably poorer than Croatia and Slovenia, but about the same (by GDP per capita) as Bulgaria or Romania.

**Nature and landscape**: Mountainous (at least compared to my country - Estonia :D) and quite forested. In the summer the temperature can easily go up to 40 degrees, while in the winter -20 degrees is normal in some parts of the country. The Donau (Danube) river flows through Serbia as well.

**Personal experience**: I have been to Serbia for a few days and managed to visit the Guca music festival, which of course is not the ethnic Serbian festival, but rather the Roma festival. Still, I must say, it was one of the coolest and weirdest event I have ever been to and I plan to revisit it. I was also stunned by the beauty of Serbian landscape, even though I come from Estonia, where mountains are nonexistant, I felt weirdly cosy there. The hills covered with oak and pine trees were wonderful. I felt a little like in some fantasy land of elves.

- Normare non significa censurare. Aggiornare le leggi ai tempi dei social network, dello streaming, della distribuzione online di contenuti, dei big data, di prism, dovrebbe essere una priorità assoluta delle democrazie mondiali. La cosa ci spaventa solo perchè i parlamenti non capiscono un cazzo dell'argomento.

He was not trying to harm the U.S. government; he was trying to shine light on it.”

&gt;Greenwald said Snowden for example did not wish to publicize information that gave the technical specifications or blueprints for how the NSA constructed its eavesdropping network. “He is worried that would enable other states to enhance their security systems and monitor their own citizens.” Greenwald also said Snowden did not wish to repeat the kinds of disclosures made famous a generation ago by former CIA spy, Philip Agee—who published information after defecting to Cuba that outed undercover CIA officers. “He was very insistent he does not want to publish documents to harm individuals or blow anyone’s undercover status,” Greenwald said. He added that Snowden told him, “Leaking CIA documents can actually harm people, whereas leaking NSA documents can harm systems.”

* Their language is probably the richest in the world as far as obscenities go.

* Nationalistic as all Balkan nations are, they're probably more even more nationalistic than the rest of us. Not sure if they'll ever get over Kosovo.

* In 80s Bulgaria, Serbian (turbo-folk) music was the shit, and when Lepa Brena came here it was the most visited concert in the country, ever. After 1990, we've been trying to develop our own genre of Serbian music, and quite successfully so.

* They are awesome in team sports, always get at least a couple of team medals from the Olympics in basketball, volleyball, handball, water polo etc.; much less so in individual sports.

* Some TV shows, mostly comedy ones, were hugely popular here in the 90s. One reason for their comic success is that whatever one says in Serbian sounds a little funny in Bulgarian (I suspect the opposite is also true).

* I really know embarrassingly little about their history, and so do most Bulgarians. We were taught very little history of our neighboring nations at school.

* There is a tangible difference in the quality of roads once you cross from Serbia into Bulgaria, in favor of the former.

* Bulgarian mafia made a lot of its money off the Serbian trade embargo in the 90s.

Les écarts de salaires ne sont pas dus à une discrimination envers les femmes, les promotions non plus. Voici [un lien](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/11lsrw/feminist_myth_of_women_earning_072_to_a_mans_1/c6nmfiv) qui résume la situation pour les États-Unis. C'est la même chose en France (écarts de 6% entre hommes et femmes pour les non CSP+ inférieur à l'écart entre individus de même sexe).

Les violences sont déjà illégales. Et [la majorité des victimes de violences physiques sont des hommes](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=ip1124&amp;reg_id=0). Ainsi, au lieu d'essayer de réduire la violence, on protège une certaine minorité de victimes (les femmes), et on laisse la majorité (les hommes).

Les tâches domestiques maintenant, ne sont pas non plus un problème d'inégalité ou de répartition au sein du couple, mais bien de gestion du temps des femmes. Pour des célibataires sans enfant (donc aucun problème d'inégalité), on remarque que les femmes consacrent déjà 1h de plus par jour que les hommes à leurs activités domestiques, auquel il faut rajouter [20 à 30 mn de sommeil en plus](http://www.invs.sante.fr/content/download/50451/214913/version/6/file/BEH_44_45_2012.pdf).

true,astrobe,FRAN,France,"I think a solution must be in two points:

Member countries should have transparency policies with regard to intelligence services and secret activities. By this I mean an elected political representative (or a bunch of) that has (ideally) full access to and is able to monitor these activities; and full right (and responsability) to disclose what they think the public should/can know about. I'm aware that this is generally the role of the president or PM, but I feel that maybe we need separation of powers here, or better, mutual monitoring. In the 80ies, French president Mitterand used intelligence services to eavesdrop various persons for his own needs. Today, we learn that France collects the metadata of communications - basically who talks to who, but not the messages themselves. One would be very naive that a country with such an infrastructure could not collect the content of the messages for a set of selected targets.

The second point is that people should care more about enforcing their own electronic privacy. This means looking for encrypted communication (email, voice, ...) solutions that are open source. The Free Open Source Software (FOSS) community has a major role to play here, to provide these tools. In the context of a would-be digital security and privacy law framework, EU should consider to fund FOSS organisations in order to help them building these tools. This would protect not only the citizens, but also the companies. Of course, this would render PRISM-like structures mostly useless. I believe they already are, because the baddies are now well aware that all their electronic comms can be intercepted.

All this doesn't have to be done at EU level. However, doing things about which every EU citizen is concerned at EU level is better for consistency and cooperation.

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"I don't know where the one eighth number came from. But regardless, representative democracy isn't a simple concept like 'one free, equal, direct, secret vote'. There's a whole host of different processes involved in modern democracy which has gone way beyond such simple processes as that. There's entire notions of contacting your MPs, strategic voting, putting in safeguards against the tyranny of the majority, the party/cabinet system that are all fundamentally 'undemocratic' when taken in simple terms like that, but which for pragmatic reasons (fairness, technological limitations, etc) serve to water down 'democracy'. 

Remember, we don't live in a democracy, we live in a 'liberal democracy' or a 'social democracy' in Europe. This means that sometimes the liberal or social part has to give way to democratic part and vice versa. In Australia, for example, we have a system of compulsory voting. In our liberal democracy, we decided that going to vote takes precedence over the 'liberal' part that says we should only vote if we want to, in order to have a more democratic outcome. Similar compromises happen all the time, everywhere, in modern governments.

Personally, I think we need to rethink how we want our societies to be in this age of technology. There's been disappointingly little political experimentation in Western democracies over the last 50 years. Now we have technology like the internet, the ability for people to quickly become informed about an issue, and the like. Maybe it would be worth getting rid of the secret ballot to allow people to have some kind of technological 'liquid democracy'? There are dozens of such possible compromises that could be made to have a possibly more democratic society.

Instead, changes in how our societies function have been driven by outside forces. By the introduction of the 24 hour news cycle (something I consider to have been abused and has lessened democracy), by media magnates. By the refinement of effective lobbying practices. It's not the people driving these changes for the benefit of the people, it's the elites for the benefit of the elites. Time for some change and experimentation, thinks I.

Let's put it this way: of all the literature, philosophy, history, art and science that made up my education (formal and informal) and in large part define who I am, the overwhelming majority comes from Europe, but not from any single country within.

The simplest example: in literature I can't point to a national tradition as the main one I've read, but I can easily say that European literature as a whole (from Portugal to Russia and everywhere in between) is by far the dominating group in my personal library.

When I was just going to main cities I took the train. Simple, fast. Loved it. Once I was up in Venice, I picked up a car and headed into Tuscany and spent 4 days seeing a few of the smaller towns. There, you simply needed a car for. Or rather, it was easier to have a car. I did not find the driving to be all that bad, really. Everything is very well labelled. I would suggest bringing your own GPS though (I ordered one, but they were all sold out) if you are not comfortable with it through.

Once I was done, we drove into Rome and dropped the car off in pretty much the centre of Rome. That was.... interesting. I loved it! It was just really chaotic. But so long as you drive the same way it all just made sense.

Michael Palin says that the various separatist movements were modelled on ""modern resistance groups, all with obscure acronyms which they can never remember and their conflicting agendas"".""

First, how is that in any way similar behaviour? Not even in the slightest. Second, I'd hazard that I know more about the CAP than 99% of people that comment frequently on /r/europe at the least. I let them know that I wrote a masters thesis so that they can choose how to discern information. If someone claime they'd written a masters thesis about something I only had passing knowledge of, I'd take their words to heart because they're probably considerably better educated than I about it. I make an argument. I can't be fucked making the same argument a hundred times to a hundred different people, so I simplify by saying that. If people choose to believe me, great. If they don't, well that's their choice. There's no dick move about it. It's not a trump card I pull, it's a way of letting other people discern if the information is likely coming from someone knowledgeable or someone talking out of their arse.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; Is it theoretically possible to create a law that forces the companies like Skype and Google to create such versions of their products that the private information is out of their reach by design, not just by law?

No, it's technically impossible.

People are missing the point when they suggest encryption. That is, while it does what it has been designed for, it's only a solution for a small part of the problem, which is protecting the content. You can encrypt the content of your email, but the main interest of intelligence agencies is who you're communicating with when from where. You can't put the address on the inside of the envelope.

There are ways around this in the case of services such as Skype by using onion routing, but even that has its limitations. You can still use timing attacks unless you pad the data. It doesn't seem to be widely known that you can still recognize an encrypted VoIP transmission as such; if you have access to enough entrance and exit nodes you can time when a word is said and piece this information together.

The main issue, however, is that you *want* Google to be able to read and even analyse your data. The most trivial example are search requests, they kinda have to be able to interpret them to give you the results you want. But modern searches go way beyond that and take many more factors into account (e.g., location). We're moving away from traditional searches towards ever more sophisticated algorithms to separate the information that is relevant to you in your momentary context from the noise. When you think about Google Now, it's even becoming a push service that presents you with information you didn't even search for yet.  
Beyond that, you want to do things such as syncing calendars, and things like ""customers who bought X also bought Y"", e.g., learning from other users and applying that information to you. Again, it's about separating signal from noise and relevance within context. Think about music recommendations that are based on what other people who listen to similar artists as you. That's actually something that tells a lot about you, especially when you combine it with other information from age to interests. Those interpretations of seemingly unrelated data points will work both for and against you in the future.

You can't (conveniently) encrypt your Facebook Wall, people seem to like to tell the world what they had for dinner (and where), all this can be analyzed for movement and personality profiles. Your phone has to check into mobile towers, and so on.

Encryption isn't entirely pointless, but it's more of a five-years-ago solution that one that will be of much help when you try to imagine where technology is heading and what a modern life will look like in another five. For the majority of the data you leak everyday, it doesn't help much.

Sono d'accordo che nelle prigioni si creino situazioni spaventose e terrificanti, motivo per cui sono personalmente contrario al 100% ad una eventuale gestione privata delle carceri; Però in questa lettera la detenuta non sta lamentando pestaggi brutali e isolamenti trentennali. Sta lamentando una gestione penosa dell'infermeria (e ok, legittimo) e sopratutto si sta lamentando che in molte fasi della sua giornata non è che può fare quello che vuole.

&gt; La prigione è il luogo dove vengono reclusi individui privati della libertà personale in quanto riconosciuti colpevoli di reati per i quali è prevista una pena detentiva [...]

^Wikipedia, ^[Prigione](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prigione).

C'è sicuramente qualcuno che è li dentro per un giudizio troppo estremo di un giudice scazzato. Ma chi finisce in galera ""più volte per brevio soggiorni"" probabilmente non rientra in questa categoria.

E' vero che la pena dovrebbe essere educativa e non semplicemente punitiva; ma comunque è una pena, e non credo che il popolo italiano sia pronto ad affrontare istituti di rieducazione come quelli nordici, in cui ai detenuti viene lasciata libertà relativa perchè anche loro capiscono il motivo per cui sono lì. In italia, s'è visto con gli indulti passati, esistono persone per cui ogni sconto di pena è un ""harhar gliel'ho fatta anche sta volta al sistema!!1!"", per cui non esiste educazione possibile, perché la galera è ""oh bello io mi son fatto tre anni di gabbio, hai capito? ti apro la faccia!""

Ok, ok, adesso arriverà qualcuno a dirmi ""ma non è giusto che i ladri di soldi alta finanza stanno fuori e il vecchio che ruba il pane va dentro"". Ma no che non è giusto, cazzo. E' sbagliato profondamente, ma è un ambito diverso; Va dentro il vecchio e il riccone. Al vecchio magari si commuta in domiciliari se sussistono ragioni d salute, toh.

Google maps has all the info you need, just put in your location and your destination and it will map the metro trains you need to get there. It's really simple. 

I've been using it for 3 weeks and figured it all out in the first day thanks to google maps and the great planning of the Paris metro system. 

It really is safe and easy and fast. And fairly cheap at 1.70 euros per ride (transfers to other trains are included). The ticket machines are easy to buy from. There are train system posters everywhere, just study them a bit and you will learn it quickly. There are also off-line smartphone apps for the train system.

The Velib rental bikes around the city are another option, almost as easy as the subway but you should register on their website before, and do download the velib bike station map app for your phone, the bike stations are everywhere but only the first 30 minutes of each ride are free (after paying the 1.70 euro day rental fee online). It's probably better to stick to metro and walking though, biking through Paris traffic is kind of crazy.

If you don't take the metro while in Paris you'll really be missing out.

The point is that the share of information where encryption would have a meaningful effect is shrinking relative to the entirety of data we leak every day, and that is required for those companies to offer their services. Remember, the question was whether services could prevent signal collection by design.
  
You can only encrypt the content of messages that are shared between a small and controlled group of people. You can't encrypt the headers.

&gt; Technically you're communicating with a mail server that handles millions of customers, so it helps a lot.

Sorry, but ""a lot"" gives people a false sense of security. How does it help beyond protecting the content? If you assume the connection and the server itself are secure, which we know they are not, then encrypting the content is redundant. The millions of other users are only relevant when you assume both connection and server are secure, in which case you *might* need a *few* more data points for a timing attack (processing power and access doesn't seem to be a problem for the NSA).

Indeed. To me, it's about a distaste for hereditary elites, coming straight from our Founders, Athenian Democracy and Roman Republic. Republic and Democracy mean roughly the same thing, a society controlled by its citizens. These concepts may have been latent for centuries, but have surfaced again eventually, and out here in Eastern Europe they carry a lot of weight (though we don't really know how to deal with them).

To me the beginnings of Europe are at the battle of [Marathon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Marathon), the one quoted to be more important to British history than the battle of Hastings. A citizens' army defeating the slave army of a ""god"" king. One may claim that it's solely Herodotus' interpretation that the Greeks would rather die than be slaves to one man; but if soldiers make history, it's writers who write it and inspire later generations.

tl;dr: I understand Europe as a citizen-centric culture, a principle I adhere to. I can only hope the EU will stick to this concept.",0,1373060826,null,0,1373062424,0,cawn4xl,t3_1hopxp,t1_cawn4xl,t1_cawd67k,null,1430571865,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

I highly doubt that his fuel indicators were faulty, that's a major failure on an aircraft. It would really be an amazing coincidence that it happened just as he was blocked from some airspace.

From what I understand, his plane was denied some airspace, and didn't have enough fuel to just go around it. It was planned to refuel in Portugal, and of course if you block the whole west-Europe airspace you can't reach it. So he landed in a nearby airport.

You can easily find out the airports he could still reach because you know how much fuel he still had at the time, since it was enough to follow his initial flight plan.

Next, his plane was either searched or not, but if it was he gave his agreement. He didn't have to.

1. Salary is quite low. In the east of Spain you are looking at about 1200-1300 euros after taxes per month. In the green North you may get up to 2000 (Bilbao)

2. You need to speak Spanish. Nobody will care if you're American, you'll just be another foreigner.

3. I asked about getting the degree recognized. It may take you up to 2 years, if not longer, for a British degree. However, apparently you can work before that.

4. If you are looking into opening an opticians, well, I can't tell you how that is going, but Alicante, for example, is littered with opticians. Over saturation? Possibly. I've considered this option for the future, but I'd be very reluctant to invest any kind of money into Spain.

5. Optometry in Spain is not as advanced as the Anglophone countries. You can't use any eye drops. You can't prescribe any medication.  

6. Visa. Are you allowed to live and work long term in Spain? It can be a real pain if you're an American without any sort of EU passport.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; I'm feeling less and less European each day, because of rejection. I feel that the main culprit in driving the hate is the UK.

You do realize that the UK is the single country most responsible for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria? There is very little chance that the EU would have expanded this quickly, and perhaps expanded so far at all, had Britain not pushed for it. 

Also, that the UK has taken the same transitionary measures as almost all other Western countries. 

The only reason you hear a British discussion about immigration from Romania is because i) you hear more news on this subreddit about Britain than other comparable countries, and ii) UK applied less strict transitionary controls than other equivalent countries, when Poland joined the EU, and as a result [approximately 400,000 Polish people moved to Britain over ten years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Polish-born_people_in_employment_in_the_UK_2003-2010_-_chart_2369a_at_statistics_gov_uk.gif), and we cannot afford such a large influx of workers in the middle of a recession and employment crisis. Equating this to 'driving hate' is really a complete embarrassment.
