Any less than that, and you discourage [frictional unemployment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frictional_unemployment) - the ""good kind"" of unemployment (people moving, people finding better jobs, etc.), generally because inflation is unbearably high ([note the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve).

His father's name is Karl Peeks and may live in Sande, Germany near a lake (Ralf had recently shown one of us coworkers on a map where his dad lived).

true,CalvaireEtLutin,Bourgogne,Bourgogne,"&gt; D'ailleurs, je viens de trouver cette étude assez intéressante ... les stats sont bien plus compliquées que tel que décrit par les journalistes.

En effet, mais les conclusions ne diffèrent pas: ""un PNA [personne perçue comme noire ou arabe] présent à la station de la gare du nord le jour du contrôle a ainsi environ 9 fois plus de chances de se faire contrôler qu'un non PNA"".
""On peut dans chacun des trois lieux étudiés faire un test du chi-deux et l'hypothèse que les distributions des PNA sont les mêmes parmi les contrôlés et parmi les non-contrôlés est dans les trois cas rejetée au risque 0.01"".

Quel que soit le critère conduisant au contrôle (habillement ou autre), le fait est que les PNA sont les premiers contrôlés.

&gt; Pour commencer, il faut savoir que la police ne contrôle pas les gens au hasard. Il faut une raison pour contrôler quelqu'un.

Précisément. Et avec le FN au pouvoir, et le durcissement de la politique à l'encontre de l'immigration illégale, la raison serait ""suspicion d'être un clandestin"". Je pense que vous avez tort de dire que le clandestin se reconnaît à ses habits (à la limite, c'est peut-être le cas pour le délinquant, encore que j'attends toujours une source). Le clandestin se reconnaît au faciès. Le clandestin est dans 99% des cas un PNA. Demander à la police d'accentuer la pression sur les clandestins, c'est du même coup augmenter la pression sur les PNA. Y compris les pas clandestins. Si vous croyez que les policiers identifient les clandestins sur la base de survet/casquette de travers, vous vous trompez lourdement. 

&gt; Du coup, la conclusion suivante est fausse :

Ben si, elle est vraie: c'est montré clairement dans l'étude que vous citez. Je ne dis pas que les critères actuels utilisés par le policier sont des critères raciaux, mais de facto, les PNA sont les premiers contrôlés. Voir plus haut.

&gt; le contrôle d'identité, c'est avant tout sur les hommes, jeunes, habillés ""jeune"", non-blanc. Par ordre d'importance. 

Deux problèmes: (i) j'attends toujours une source pour cette déclaration; (ii) même si c'était le cas aujourd'hui, avec une politique FN visant à accentuer la pression sur les clandestins, ce ne le serait plus.

true,elphieLil84,sardegna,,"Per ora. Ma il fatto è che si stanno creando due tendenze nel mondo.

Da un lato, il mondo in via di sviluppo, che sta modernizzando la produzione di cibo ADESSO, e passa ora dalla fase della produzione di massa. In questo mondo, malnutrito fino a ieri, la produzione di massa e i prezzi bassi significa che meno gente muore di fame,può sopravvivere, lavorare, pagare le tasse aumentare il benessere del Paese. Vagli a dire di rialzare i costi se abbiamo coraggio.

Il mondo sviluppato, invece, è sempre più attento alla qualità del cibo. A parte alla qualità oggettiva, è tutto un fioire di BIO e DOC,DOP,etc. La gente è disposta a pagare di più per il cibo,e il rispetto di certe regole (come l'allevamento sostenibile e ""umano"")é sempre più importante nella scelta d'acquisto. La UE come istituzione arriva a dare rimborsi stellari ad agricoltori e allevatori che sostengono il paesaggio e il territorio e rispettano queste regole. Di conseguenza, i prezzi non sono inaccessibili. Con tutta questa attenzione per la qualità, noi spendiamo sul cibo una percentuale di Income comunque molto più bassa rispetto alla famiglia media del Paese in via di sviluppo.

Andando noi sempre di più in questa direzione e loro nell'altra, ci sono due possibilità. O loro seguiranno la nostra evoluzione (da prodotto schifo di massa che maltratta gli animali a prodotto lusso sostenibile), o si creeranno altri equilibri, soprattutto considerando il prezzo dei prodotti e come viaggeranno da una parte verso l'altra. I ricchi cinesi già comprano bio per esempio. Consumano più carne,ma se possono fanno anche i sostenibili :)

In tutto questo, occupandomi di sviluppo, ti posso dire che è un dibattito di non poco conto.

Well, it's nice for them to put what it's really about in the first paragraph.

They're not concerned about us Europeans or our abilities to defend ourselves, they're concerned about the fact that we don't share America's interest in pissing our wealth down a giant military hole.

NATO is outdated now, it was made as a counterpoint to the USSR, back when there were only two global powers. It needs to accept that that world has passed, and either change to fit the current one or fade into the past as well.

Besides, because we're all cutting our military does not mean we're less of a threat. The UK is the 4th biggest spender, France is 6th, Germany is 9th and Italy is 10th. Those plus all the other EU countries spending, adds up to a pretty large amount, which will at some point (assuming the EU integrates further and doesn't fall apart) all be consolidated together into one military force.

I think the problem here is that America looks at its military budget compared to everyone else's (it's bigger than the next dozen countries *combined*, and instead of thinking 'Ours is so high, what's up with us?' they think 'Everyone else' is so low, what's up with them?'",0,1367401566,null,0,false,0,c9q7svi,t3_1dgzz7,t1_c9q7svi,t3_1dgzz7,null,1431363127,30,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,30

But something very important also is gradually changing: our 500+years adulation of everything German.

""In the short run, the divergence in borrowing costs between weaker and stronger countries hurts economic recovery efforts. Banks paying more to borrow have to lend at higher rates.

That’s partly because French, German and U.K. banks have been reducing their lending to banks and companies in southern European countries. In 2010, when Ireland had to bail out its banks and was prevented from imposing losses on creditors, lenders based in those three countries had $112 billion of exposure to the Irish banking system. By the end of September 2012, that was down to $31 billion, according to the Bank for International Settlements.

While a country breakdown showing who owns Slovenia’s bank debt isn’t available, total foreign exposure to lenders in the Adriatic nation fell by 50 percent in a year to $3 billion at the end September, BIS data show.
‘Run Away’

“Now that the bankers have run away from the periphery, German and French politicians no longer care about bank creditors,” said Paul De Grauwe, an economics professor at the London School of Economics. “Germany now says taxpayers shouldn’t bear the costs of bank restructuring, but what it really means is German taxpayers shouldn’t. Slovenian or Cypriot people are stuck with the costs since German bankers are gone.”

While I personally wouldn't do it, there's a reason why thousands in Germany opted out of having a picture of their house taken on a random day and then having that picture on the Internet for years, and that reason is that they they don't think future employers should decide on whether they keep their front yard tidy enough or not, which very much falls into the realm of privacy.

And really, Street View is an extremely nonessential service. Aerial pictures are completely satisfactory when it comes to finding your way.

You conveniently leave out the UK. I believe the situation is the same in Sweden, Norway, and a few other Nordic countries. 

&gt;But mostly, all these institutions are an inheritance from the past which we've been steadily moving away from, in contrast with some US states.

So the US is worse because one of its states is moving towards a state similar to European countries?

&gt;Bullshit.

Except it isn't. The established religion in the UK is responsible for those records.

Since you wanna see the entire country, Berlin is the place to be for electronic music. The Berghain is an obvious tip you'll get - tho I'd say the Boilerroom Berlin http://boilerroom.tv/category/berlin/ is what is most fitting for your needs. There are a lot of clubs in Berlin tho, and my guess is, if you just talk to some of the people you meet and end up in random parties, you''ll have the night of your life.

Speaking of the Schwarzwald - there used to be good venues in the city of Karlsruhe and Stuttgart - tho I haven't been clubbing in any of those cities for a while now, even more so since the Cine Colibri closed in Stuttgart - but the Barcode is still there http://www.barcode-stuttgart.de/ you wanna look under 'Monatsprogramm' and technically Stuttgart isn't in the Schwarzwald^^ you can google for 'Freiburg im Breisgau' - Freiburg is a minor city (about 230k people) with a University - but I am out of touch with the scene there.

If you come to Germany in the beginning of the year, around april, then visiting the Timewarp in Mannheim might be great. It is a festival basiclly with random lineup. Sven Väth is there like every year, and he always makes for a great party http://www.time-warp.de/mannheim/about/index_ger.html

The one city I can talk about is Nürnberg (Nuremberg). Besides being historically worth the visit, there are several smaller clubs for electronic musik, the most prominent Hirsch http://www.der-hirsch.de/ - tho tbh one has to say they play loads of different kind of music and also electronic - and Die Rakete http://www.dierakete.com/  If you come to Nürnberg and need a guide, just PM me^^

Talking about another major city - München - the Harry Klein http://harrykleinclub.de/ might have the music you are looking for.

Again, irrelevant to religion

About the UK, that's definitely fishy. But there is simply a state registry just like anywhere else, and the head of the church and state does not have real political power. She's a historical tourist attraction which the country inherited throughout the years. 

The same can be said about a lot of these religious institutions in Europe. We come from a time, not that long ago, that there were these completely dominant religions and we still carry their inheritance with us. But why are you looking at this, rather than where the real power lies: with the politicians?

In the same way, you can make a point that In god we trust is similarly unimportant, but you would be wrong. The importance is not in the saying, but in the fact that modern American politicians found it relevant or necessary or beneficial or whatever to explicitly thank god on money, which no modern European state would ever do.

Or what about the latest set of presidential candidates? Many of them have publicly disavowed science in favor of creationism, young earth hypothesis, explicitly base their social policy on the bible (abortion, euthanasia) or thanking god in every single public appearance. If a politician in my country said he believed the earth was 6000 years old and evolution is a hoax, he would be ridiculed and his political career would be dead.

Neither does the head of any church in the US.

Something that is excusable in the case of Europe, but inexcusable in the case of the US?

Because most of your gripes with the US were equally symbolic.

&gt;The importance is not in the saying, but in the fact that modern American politicians found it relevant or necessary or beneficial or whatever to explicitly thank god on money, which no modern European state would ever do.

Hahaha. British money carries the abbreviated phrase ""ELIZABETH II DEI GRATIA REGINA FIDEI DEFENSOR"", ""Elizabeth II, by the grace of God, Queen and Defender of the Faith"". If I had to bother to check, I'm sure other European currencies carry similar anachronisms.

Well, no. From a lot of reasons, going from humanitarian to stopping the next world war. If you want to close the borders of your country and trade only internally, you can do that, but coming from Romania I can tell you it's not as nice as it might sound.

And don't think it's only multi-nationals, it's also the small software businesses in France taking their testing and developing departments to India or Russia, while receiving innovation tax credits from the government... It's the guy that's selling a kickstarter 3D printer that's manufactured in China (irony much?). The problem for me is that we're using the wrong benchmark: growth. Being French you can probably relate better to the fact that at one point in your life, you have all that you need and you continue to work and all to keep it. This should be enough. Because you won't feel better in your skin if you have 3 extra m² of living space or 10 extra horse power on your car. But people do this. Same goes for big business: they're judged on growth. Look at Microsoft. They're stable, they have a good business model, clients keep using their products and keep buying it. But their stock dropped and stagnated for years just because they didn't continue growing like some corporation out of a cheap SciFi movie that controls Earth (or Google). 

If we switch a different benchmark or more exactly, benchmarks, for investing, you'll have companies adapting to it... and you'll see more jobs in France, because they're being judged by investors on usefulness in the society: if they create jobs in France, if their products are of good quality, if 10 years from now I'll still get a constant flow of dividends... thinking long term investment and based on dividends and not on stock value.

The latest good news I heard in the EU comes from France actually. There's talk of banning or limiting programmed obsolescence. Making the mandatory warranty go up to 5 years. That's not protectionism, that thinking sustainability... And when your fridge will have to last you 20 years, you'll see a lot of Made in France or Germany made fridges... not because the Chinese aren't capable of building them. But because they can afford to ask for a made in france price... Maybe I'm dreaming...

But talking about sustanability as a benchmark: imagine france had only one company for everything (electricity, radiators, computers...). And that company was moving its jobs to China, while selling exclusively to France, meaning its former employees that are now broke. Would you invest in it? No, and you'd sell all your assets and short the hell out of it, because you know they're pulling the rug from under their feet. Problem is: France has tens of thousands of companies... so you need to study more. Therefore, economic project X should be: benchmarking economical sustainability in a global environment. Then, you'll be able to give bonuses to traders based on actual results and not on overnight.

As for the economy and the ongoing crisis some folks say that ""in the situation when you don't produce anything and don't export anything to other countries, you live on a borrowed money and a borrowed time"".

More importantly, in globalized economy there is no need to pay John Smith 3k$ per month, when Li Wu can and will be glad to work for 300$ per month. So effectively you are competing not against your local population, but against 2-3 billion Asians as well + immigrants ofc.


I think the reason even Germany wants for EU to succeed is because they are export driven economy, meaning *They need markets for their production and ability to buy their products*. If u can't sell anything and your warehouses are full of stockpiled shit, you are unable to provide jobs for your own population, BECAUSE no one needs your crap anyway.

I did *not* try to *'sell it as a totally non-problematic development'*. You are lying. I presume you're lying because your initial claim is so obviously false you look a little silly. But being silly *and* being a liar isn't an obvious improvement on just being silly.


&gt;*vast parts of the population are not benefiting from the bigger pie*

Here's the [**World Average GDP per capita rise**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/World_GDP_Per_Capita_1500_to_2000,_Log_Scale.png/350px-World_GDP_Per_Capita_1500_to_2000,_Log_Scale.png) since 1500.  [**Here's the US rise**](http://visualeconsite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/RealGDPperCapita.png) since 1871.

Now with such an enormous and impressive increase it would be dumbfounding if 'vast parts of the population' had nevertheless not benefited. So someone unaware of any facts but your silly claim and those two graphs would by now be feeling extremely suspicious.

So which '*vast parts or the population*' have not  benefited, over what period of time?

The ""heute show"" started as a stiff and slightly awkward copy of ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" but quickly found its own tone and voice and is now one of the most enjoyable ways to get your weekly dose of German news and politics (and in all fairness, the early days of ""The Daily Show"" were just as awkward).

""Roche &amp; Böhmermann"" was probably one of the most creative and overall enjoyable and unique (and visually stunning) talk shows ever created, not just on German TV. Naturally, it wouldn't last more than two short seasons (not because it was canceled - it ended up winning just about every price one can win on German TV - but due to creative differences the creators couldn't overcome). Still, if you have a chance to watch it - do! You can still watch all of them (?) online, over here:
http://www.zdf.de/ZDFmediathek/kanaluebersicht/aktuellste/1583110#/kanaluebersicht/1583110

""Neues aus der Anstalt"" is a very German, very traditional ""politisches Kabarett"" show. It's created by quite talented people and can still be very funny and poignant, but is certainly less approachable.

""Genial Daneben"" was (or is, is that thing still going?) Germany's answer to ""QI"" and inferior in every way and then some - while it may make you chuckle once in a while, it's painful to watch if you know the original. Don't bother.

If you like ""Who Wants to be a Millionair?"", then Germany's version is one of the, if not the most enjoyable one world wide. There can be a great deal of humor and its host certainly can bring the best out of the usually mundane banter. At the end of the day, it's still just another ""Who Wants to be a Millionair?"" - take it or leave it. But at its best, it can be *a lot* better than its UK or US counterparts ever were (the reason why it's still running on prime time after over a decade).

""Kalkofes Mattscheibe"" is a bit reminiscent of Charlie Brooker's ""Screen Wipe"" or E!'s ""The Soup"" but with its own unique style. A quick and easy way to explore all the terrible shallowness of German day time TV without getting too much direct exposure.

""Quarks &amp; Co"" is one of the better, if not the best science shows on German TV and frequently follows up on current events from a scientific point of view.

You *can't* change trains (e.g. go an hour later or earlier, you have to take the exact train on your ticket) and canceling a ticket either costs a service fee or becomes impossible on the day of travel. Missed a train or had to change your plans on that day? Tough luck, you lost your money and have to pay full price, again.

If you decide to do a lot of train trips and/or know how many, look into the different Bahn-cards, which reduce ticket prices by 25% or 50% respectively and often already pay off after a couple of trips.

All the successive governments since then have been playing a game of ""hot potato"", riding on the bubble without changing the productive model, hoping that said bubble would blow up in hands of the other major party.

true,StoneCall,SACH,Leipzig,"&gt; I know most things can be paid by credit card, but I will need some euros for smaller things. Any recommendation for an appropriate amount of Euros we should bring with us? Keep on us?

ATMs are plentiful, so that should be the least of your worries. As to how much cash I'm carrying around: I always get 90€ from the ATM and use it until it runs out. So I carry at most ~100€ with me. Depending on the fees you incur when getting cash, you might want to withdraw more at a time to save.

&gt; Would we save money by getting a train pass before we arrive? I know that I can go to bahn.de and order one. I am trying to figure out the costs to travel to those various cities I listed above. If the pass is cheaper, I will get that. Bahn.de doesn't list the prices for travelling in August yet. Are the prices different in August than they are in April/May?

You can book at most three months in advance, and tickets are cheaper the longer you book them in advance. To get an approximate idea of how expensive your train travels will be, check the prices now for the last day in the three-month timespan, but wait until the weekdays align (Fridays and to a lesser degree Sundays are often more expensive than other days).

So for instance, if you want to travel on Wednesday, the 18th of September, you can check the prices today for Wednesday, the 31st of July, and see that a ticket from Nuremberg to Leipzig costs 35€ when you take the train at 14:35, but 29€ for any other train.

Don't forget to book your tickets on the first day they become available. You can assume the prices will be similar if there isn't some kind of large event on one of the days you've chosen as comparison.

An alternative is the Bayernticket, especially since you're travelling with your husband: it costs 26 euros for two people and allows you to take all regional (no ICE and IC) trains within Bavaria (and to/from some adjoining cities such as Ulm and Salzburg) for one day, and allows you to use other public transport, too. The advantage is that the price always stays the same no matter when you book it.

There might also be a Probe BahnCard 25 available which costs 25 euros and knocks off 25% off any price for four months. Additionally, you get a City-Ticket for some cities, which means you can use public transport within the city from the railway station to your destination and back. Attention: You need to cancel it, otherwise it turns into a normal BahnCard!

&gt; Is there some sort of card/pass I can get for the U-Bahn/S-Bahn? We will be using the subways/streetcars. How much do they cost normally if I am just using pocket change? I know it depends on the distance but can someone give me examples?

The word to look out for is ""Verkehrsverbund"", so if you google ""Verkehrsverbund &lt;city&gt;"" you can find the relevant prices. They depend on the city but in general you can assume to pay around 2€ for a single fare.

&gt; Do the trains run very late at night? We were thinking of traveling from Munich to Salzburg near the end of our trip to see a Mozart performance. We want to make sure we can get back to Munich that night.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;You are quoting a particular school of economics as the correct one.

Dude, it's mainstream economics, read something about monetary policy and it will tell you that, it's quite simple macroeconomics. In the page I sent you it even says that ""mainstream economists agree that the quantity theory holds true in the long run"".

&gt;Instead, would you mind going through this article for me and telling me what you think is wrong with it?

OK.

&gt;Neoclassical economists assume that society is made up of independent, self-interested, and ~~all-knowing~~ human beings, who come together in marketplaces over which they exert ~~no~~ control, and ~~all at once~~ arrive at agreements in such a way that every market clears. That is, a price is established at which the supply of ~~every single~~ commodity ~~equals~~ the demand for it. Furthermore, the general equilibrium achieved is one of maximum social efficiency. It is what economists call “Pareto efficient,” after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto; it describes an equilibrium such that no change away from it can make at least one person better off without making anyone else worse off.

There, I corrected it a bit, the perfect competition model is just a model, just because it actually doesn't exist in real life, you can't just say ""these are abstract models, there's imperfect competition so in real life it's actually the opposite"".

&gt;Since the notion of social efficiency has been defined prior to its building, and the equilibrium set of prices satisfies this definition, it follows that any deviation from equilibrium will be inefficient. Economists use this model to argue the undesirable consequences of minimum wage laws, labor unions, price controls, rent controls, income taxes, environmental regulations—indeed just about anything a government does **(with regards to the economy)**.

Well, all those things you mentioned have real negative impacts. I wouldn't argue against taxes as those are needed to keep public services working and against environmental regulations as that prevents externalisation of costs but all the others do harm the economy and countries with the least of that are countries where the people live better off.

&gt;In addition, all attempts by governments to counteract unemployment (which can only be caused by some external and temporary shock to the economy, such as a drought or a flood) will be self-defeating, since the all-knowing buyers and sellers will immediately act to nullify the desired results of the government policymakers.

Well, government doesn't counteract unemployment, people counteract unemployment. It's all about the labour market and how government interferes with it. Besides, creating employment is easy, you could for example ban all agricultural hardware, suddenly there would be an huge demand for farmers and we'd go back to living like we did some centuries ago where the vast majority of the people lived off the land. That however, would be retarded, the goal isn't employment but rather the outcome of it.

&gt;Their intellectual history is the prelude to an examination of the Great Recession triggered by the bursting of the housing bubble. The authors argue that the failure of mainstream economists either to see that an economic collapse was coming or to know what to do about it was due in large part to what they call “lost truths” and “inherent errors.”

Plenty of people predicted it, the Austrian school of economics kept on arguing against the low interest rates and it seems they were right.

&gt;Combined with the argument that the utility of additional money falls, the more money a person has, Utilitarianism gives us ample justification for many public policies. Adler provides numerous clear and enlightening examples of eminently good public programs that have been routinely condemned by neoclassical economists. These include price controls for necessary medicines, subsidies to those with low incomes, Medicare, rent controls, progressive taxation, and anti-pollution laws—against which Lawrence Summers infamously wrote that it is socially desirable for rich nations to dump their toxic wastes in poor countries, since people there do not live long, and their lives are consequently worth less than ours in rich nations. 

Price controls lead to shortages. Same thing with rent controls.

Subsidies to those with low incomes were never condemned by neoclassical economists (Milton Friedman supported the idea of a Negative Income Tax, Friedrich Hayek was for comprehensive system of social insurance, etc). Same thing Medicare. Same thing with progressive taxation and anti-pollution laws.

&gt;Economics for the Rest of Us also describes some seldom discussed consequences of growing income inequality.

Yeah, ""inequality"", like Thatcher would say, these people would rather have the poor poorer provided the rich were less rich.

&gt;Adler first points out one of the major features of modern capitalist economies, namely, the pervasiveness of monopoly or, to be more precise, oligopoly—market structures in which one or a few large business firms dominate production. Monopoly confers pricing power on the monopolist, which leads to higher prices and smaller output than when markets are more competitive.

And pretty much all monopolies are a consequence of government action. You tell me a monopoly that has on being a monopoly without any kind of government intervention.

&gt;The remarkable thing is that, from the neoclassical point of view, the economic pie gets bigger even as inequality worsens.

And the remarkable thing is that, from the marxist point of view, the economic pie is best when there's no inequality and everybody is miserably poor. I just wonder why it was the East Germans flooding Western Germany and not the opposite.

&gt;Despite Adler’s powerful arguments in favor of greater equality (his section on education, where inequality is as dire as it is ignored by education reformers, is a must-read), his neoclassical brethren say that inequality is a good thing.

Fucking bullshit. Nobody is for inequality, what people are is for no enforcement of equality. That's like saying ""oh, you don't support affirmative action? Then you're a racist"".

&gt;Certain grim predictions flow from Clark’s model: raising the minimum wage will cause an increase in unemployment; union wages will do the same. And mass unemployment (as in the Great Depression) is the consequence of the failure of wage rates to fall enough to induce employers to hire more people. Adler shows readers that there is not a shred of evidence for these predictions.

Except, well, massive youth unemployment in countries with high minimum wages such as Greece and Spain and very low youth unemployment in countries without such measures such as Germany and Finland.

&gt;The most outrageous neoclassical proposition is that the Great Depression can be explained by so-called “sticky” wages. Both free market extremists, such as Milton Friedman, and liberal moderates, such as Joseph Stiglitz, blame workers for mass unemployment.

Again, fucking bullshit, the blame was in first the Federal reserve keeping interest rates too low leading to a bubble and then massively reducing the money supply leading when it burst creating massive deflation.

So yes, the blame with the sticky-wages but not with the workers, it was with the governmental authorities, how were people supposed to know at the time that the amount of dollars in the economy had shrunk by 1/3? Prices are sticky, it's impossible for the market to converge like that and just like that reduce all prices and wages and everything by 1/3. Anyway, the blame for all this crap was with the central authorities which caused the whole thing.

&gt;Both Modern Political Economy and Economics for the Rest of Us conclude that neoclassical economics almost always shows a preference for institutional arrangements and public actions that benefit those who are wealthy and powerful.

""HURR DURR, THE RICH WANT TO EXPLOIT THE POOR""

&gt;It is, to put it bluntly, an ideology that helps keep us ignorant of the exploitative class relationships that define capitalism.

Yeah, fucking economists who earn as much as teachers, they're just so evil and so rich that they want to oppress with their theories which are proven right both by their models and by empirical observation of the impacts of government intervention in the economy specially in countries where this is more prevalent.

&gt;However, stating the obvious stupidities and shortcomings of neoclassical economics will do nothing to weaken its hold. Unless, that is, a significant number of students and economists ally themselves with working men and women: teaching them, writing for and with them, becoming one of them in their own workplaces.

Yeah, you should want that for Greece, rise of the proletariat and all that, it always worked out fine in the past!

NATO membership doesn't force us to serve US interests at all. Its done via unanimity and even beyond that nations still do not partake. Libya is a great example of that. Germany voted yes to NATO (remember consensus is needed), but had zero part in the mission and actively stated that.

One extra thing to remember is the US goes back and forth with its European criticisms. On one hand it criticises a lack of military budget in Europe and wants more spending.

Historiquement, la France s'inscrit dans une logique de protection du travailleur. Il faut se dire qu'on considère le plus souvent le travaileur comme ""partie faible"" au contrat de travail, et que c'est pour ça que le Code du travail et les juridictions sociales ont tendance à vouloir protéger le salarié par rapport à l'employeur.

Certains critiqueront le manque de flexibilité de ce système, d'autres trouveront justement que c'est son point fort. C'est l'éternel débat qui oppose les syndicats de travailleurs au syndicats de salariés. 

Adopter un nouveau code du travail (qui a été refait en 2008), ça me parait peu probable. Après, une lente modification du présent code du travail est très probable. Hollande a une vision très sociale démocrate du droit du travail, il veut du dialogue social dans l'entreprise. Il veut que les patrons et salariés coopèrent, il ne veut pas de syndicats salariés dans une bête opposition, et ne veut pas que les employeurs ne pensent qu'à leurs avantages propres.

To me, the euro is a project that would never have been created in the UK version of the EU because it leads inexorably down a path towards a fully federal europe to which we're vehemently opposed to being a member of. I honestly at this point cannot see any more power being transferred to the EU from the UK, I think we're as integrated as we are going to get.

So like I said it's about ideas of what the EU should be, we don't really agree with being in a federal europe, whereas Germany, France e.t.c. obviously do, they only quibble over the details not the fundamental idea of it.

Especially if the government has these shortfalls because they bailed out failed banks. If they then tax the citizen to cover that it is robbery plain and simple. A fairer thing to do would be to offer the citizens tax relief, which directly stimulates the individual by essentially giving everyone a pay raise at no cost to the employer.

Obviously each nation has it's own issues it is facing and it's own resources to deal with the issues.

Of course it isn't. Are you actually saying that since the rules have been broken, we do not have to care about them at all any more? Does that goes for all the rules then? Because then I will start to advocate for the fact that my country should stop paying their European bills. Why should we - rules have been broken so no one has to follow them at all any more apparently .


&gt;Well, then we might as well dissolve the eurozone now, before this gets any more embarrassing. It's impossible to have a currency union without fiscal transfers of some sort. 

I couldn't agree more. Of course countries will have to leave, it is obvious. 

So you honestly think it is fair and right to introduce fiscal transfers which goes directly against the treaty without re-negotiating the treaty and let people vote?

Do you think the Finns deserve to transfer money south, in what seems to be at least for decades and don't even get to vote about i?

What other laws do you think you can just break because you don't like them?

If you can do this -can't all the countries do this as well? Why do we even have treaties and laws if no one gives a shit? 

How do you expect anything to be built if we do not have the rule of law?

It does not solve the current problem. The problems are much bigger than this . Despite - do you think it is right towards the Finns to go against a treaty and force them to pay off other countries debt? However, no matter how you are twisting it, you want other countries to pay off the souths debt. This would obviously come from the Finnish tax payers money, you can twist it however you want, but that is what is happening.

Siamo un Paese fragile ed ignorante: la storia della Repubblica Italiana è una storia di ingravescente malgoverno, che arriva al suo apice con gli spaventosi 20 anni di occupazione della vita politica e culturale da parte della banda berlusconiana.

Per finire, siamo all'indomani dello schiaffo peggiore che si potesse concepire. 

Schiaffo impartito dalla classe politica che governa il Paese.

Schiaffo ricevuto, si badi, non dall'elettorato (non concepisco la politica come la televisione o come facebook), ma dalla natura dei rapporti democratici tra Paese, Parlamento, Governo e Presidenza della Repubblica come tentò di definirli la nostra bellissima e stuprata Costituzione.

So bene che un popolo grande ed in larga misura ignorante può partorire, e sta partorendo, parole ed azioni mostruose.

Ma non si tenti di attribuire la responsabilità dei comportamenti devianti, violenti, distruttivi ed autodistruttivi, alle occasionali parole di passione di chi si occupa di politica, perché la sofferenza che origina quei comportamenti è drammaticamente reale, non frutto di suggestione od imbonimento. 

A gesti come l'attacco ai carabinieri che avevano la sfortuna, da dipendenti, di indossare i simboli di uno Stato ormai odiato dalla maggioranza del Paese, si dovrebbe rispondere con profonda pietà e raddoppiato impegno per realizzare immediate, concrete iniziative di sostegno all'economia ed al tessuto sociale del Paese.

L'invito ad abbassare i toni, rivolto da chi con naturalezza, sulle porte del Parlamento, rivolge gesti di disprezzo ai manifestanti, non è ammissibile. 

E' come se, ad un processo per stupro o per rapina con violenza, ci si rivolgesse con toni severi alla vittima invitandola a non manifestare la sua sofferenza per non causare tafferugli in aula - mentre nell'ufficio del Giudice, magistrati e criminali concordano una linea d'azione comune ai danni della vittima.

Siamo ad un processo, alla spontanea Norimberga di una classe dirigente criminale, avida, ignorante. Ed il punto non sono le lamentele della vittima, ma il torto che ha subito. La vittima è il Paese intero, ed il torto è imperdonabilmente grave.

E' vero che l'equilibrio è un valore e che il disordine va evitato, è vero che bisogna uscire da questa situazione con gli strumenti della civiltà. Ma l'equilibrio che, con questi richiami alla ragione, si vorrebbe tutelare, è l'equilibrio del privilegio e dell'ingiustizia, dell'illegalità, della menzogna.

Yes it was a personal attack because you know nothing about Irish history so don't act like you are an expert.

&gt;The British empire was cruel at times I'll grant you that, my countrymen have committed atrocities against a lot of people, I won't apologise for that but I will acknowledge it.

Then you will realise why we refused to join one evil empire to fight another evil empire.

&gt;but it did nothing in order to help the allies in anyway.

If you knew anything about Irish history you would realise that British soldiers that landed in Ireland were arrested and let go at the Northern border while their German counterparts were interned for the rest of the war and Vital Information regarding the German ambassador were handed over to the allies.

&gt;but what about allowing pilots who joined the RAF to return after the war?

They betrayed their country by joining our old enemy, The war of independence was still very fresh in the minds of the people then. They joined the army that wished us to be under the control of a foreign power.

&gt; I'll agree that doing anything such as denouncing Germany and declaring war could have lead to bombings

We did get bombed for helping the British

&gt;Where was Ireland from 1939-1945?

Trying to fix the mess that Britain made of it. We were a newly formed country still trying to lay down the foundations of the state. We weren't even declared a Republic until after the war, Our constitution wasn't even fully formed yet.

&gt;Where was Ireland when Germany had taken Poland?

The same place as Britain was, at home.

&gt;Where was Ireland when Germany had taken France?

Not having our men killed in a futile battle, The only reason the war was won was because of the U.S and Russia, and army of less than 10,000 men would have done nothing against the Germans.

This is why the genetic map of Europe show a [geographic relation](http://www.molecularecologist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/journal.pgen_.1002886.g002.png)  ([another one](http://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0960982208009561-gr1.jpg)), even if the haplogroup distribution favours a more East/West split base on R1b/R1a (and J/I), which in this case shows similarities between Iberia and the British Isles due to specific pre and proto-historic events that had a certain Atlantic affinity (e.g. [megalithism](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Megawal31.jpg) and the Celts, mostly, also LBK (see [The European Mesolithisation of a Caucasian Neolithic, or the Origin of the Indo European Language family](http://rokus01.wordpress.com/2010/12/28/mesolithisation/) - nice [map](http://rokus01.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/lbk-genetic-correlation.jpg) -  for a typical exploration of this complex matters, i.e. the continuity or discontinuity of the Neolithic)

Both (haplogroups and autosomal) are interesting, but have different strengths and applications. Some caution is needed since many of this maps vary (sometimes drastically) and many revisions have been made in the last decade (there is all sorts of trends involved, from ""we are all from the Ice Age"" to ""we are all Neolithic""). Also, having the same haplogroup doesn't mean populations always looked the same - each haplogroup has different haplotypes, which are more restricted and generally have a narrower geographic scope.

Also note that this intra-European differences are noticeable but are extremely small when compared to anything beyond Europe.

In order to get a fair return on the money they've lent to the southern countries, the northern countries would extract wealth from the southern.

Defence would remain as is. Trident would be an absolute certainty as the UK moved closer to the US. EU defence would be unaffected.

Immigration to the UK from the EU would be cut. The UK could then control immigration policy and try to ensure the 'right' immigrants came. This also of course reduces 'good' immigrants, so it's unclear if it would be a good thing. It does avoid the Romania/Bulgaria problem - however nobody knows if it's going to be a real problem or not.

The decades long split in the conservative party in the UK would be over. UKIP would have no purpose and would end up joining the tories - who would shift to the right. There's a reasonable chance that some tories wouild go to labour or libdems. It might cause a shake up. 

The Eurosceptics within the EU - the wise countries like the Scandinavians, some of the Baltic states, the Czech Republic would be doomed to break from the EU themselves or continue to be sucked towards union. Without the UK's influence they'd have much less weight behind them.

I never really believed the stereotype until I lived in Italy, but Americans really are just louder than Europeans, especially a group of young Americans. Try to observe and adhere to Italian social customs, as you'll fit in better, and it's the respectful thing to do. It's tough, but just put yourself out there and try to meet other young Italians. The best times I've had here have been dinners and drinks with my new Italian friends. I'm currently in Italy, and while I'm not doing study abroad, I am informally studying Italian while I'm here. I put up a flyer for a language exchange looking for someone who wanted to practice their English and I could practice Italian. I've met two women my age this way, and this has given me a way to meet other young Italians. I know it's intimidating, but you just have to do it! Florence is full of Americans pretty much year-round, so it would be easy to insulate yourself and only hang-out with other English-speakers, but remember that you're abroad and you only have so much time to make Italian friends!

Florence, in general, is, I think, quite a safe city, but you always need to be aware of pick-pockets, esp. around the historical center (the area around the duomo). If you're a woman, take all of the normal precautions about drinking too much in public, and honestly, if you're a man, take care as well! Partying too hard is a great way to get injured, arrested, and/or robbed. Italians, in my experience, don't really tolerate public drunkenness. Drinking culture here is quite different from the US, so be careful not to get out of control. So while drinking is prevalent, it's done primarily for enjoying the pleasure of the drink, and not as a means to an end (drunkenness).

Italy is amazing, the people are really friendly, the food is great, and Tuscany is phenomenal. If you like the outdoors, I suggest you try to hike parts of the via Francigena while you're there.

It was not only a false accusation, but a false confession.

The psychology of false confessions is quite well understood and researched. Google ""internalized false confession"" and read some articles from the top of the results.

What they did during that interrogation is typical. They deprived her of sleep, tag teamed her putting constant pressure, persuaded her that she had amnesia because of the traumatic events of the murder, fed false information to make her doubt her own memory even more. Basically, they brainwashed her.

Ours? Not to the benefit of the Finns, that is for sure. Why should we prioritise the Greeks above the Finns? 

Also, I doubt that there is benefit to bending the rules. See what it has lead to. Had the rules not been bent, the Eurozone wouldn't have been such a disaster area. So, despite the overwhelming evidence that bending the rules leads to disaster (with added help of a badly constructed Euro of course) you think it is a good idea to bend them more? 


Personally, I think that is even worse. 


How do you expect anything to be build if you can't respect the rules? 

&gt;A temporary solution does not necessarily mean direct transfers although it might entail some short-term risk sharing. That's not so bad, is it?

There is no such thing as a temporary solution, because it is not like one can transfer X billion to Greece for example, and then they can stand on their own to feet. Honestly, the EU has been transferring money to the south for the last 25 years, and it does not seem to have made an impact. Then you say just a little bit more for a short term will make a difference? I honestly would have a hard time finding an economist who would believe you, nevermind the man in the street. 

Second - short term risk sharing a) it is not short term, it is long term. As I said, the problem with the lack of competitiveness of the south for example will not go away. And, risk sharing is money transfer. The Finns will have to pay for your risk, your interest rate - for a long time. Why should they do that? They have not bended the rules, not even once - they did everything right. And, as thanks for that they get higher interest rates than their neighbour Sweden? Adding to that, what you are suggesting goes against the treaty. 

And yes, it is bad, for several reasons. First, because it goes against the Maastricht treaty and any union have to be built upon the law. Second, because it goes directly against what the people voted for (they would most definately have voted no if they had known that it involved debt sharing and transfers) and is is enormously disrespectful, not to mention extremely undemocratic to heap it on afterwards. It can simply not be allowed for those reasons in itself, but there is more. 

You are implying that it is short term, which it is not of course. Even with their own currency, and on the receiving end of money from the EU the Greeks for example haven't exactly managed their finances well, or even built up competitive industries. Same goes for south of Italy for example. I am a bit more unsure about Ireland for example, but at the least, even for Ireland, we are talking over a decade of transfers, I'd say aroung 15 years. So, I guess at least 30 years of transfers for some of the countries in southern Europe. 


And, which you and I agree about, there will need to be re-negotiating and voting. Do you think any country in the north will vote yes to what you are suggesting? I very much doubt it, so personally I think the best solution is for either the north and the south to leave - sooner than later because it is not like it going to get easier.

Because if economic activity slows down elsewhere, demand for Finish products will also go down and then you also fall into recession. 

It's the same principle that you help people outside of your immediate family, only applied to countries: it makes the whole system smoother. 

Besides, you keep putting words in my mouth. Who said to prioritise Greeks over Finns? The only thing that guy suggested was that the ECB takes some extra risk by issuing some bonds on its own. Finland's financial position is not worsened except in the very worst case. 

&gt; There is no such thing as a temporary solution, because it is not like one can transfer X billion to Greece for example, and then they can stand on their own to feet.

You keep misrepresenting my views. Not once did I say ""send X billion to Greece now"". EU cohesion funds are making a difference but you can hardly expect all regions in the continent to have the same capacity for economic output; that is impossible. 

&gt; They have not bended the rules, not even once - they did everything right.

It's not that Finland has been doing their work and everyone else hasn't; it's mostly a matter of circumstance. You do have regions that are underperforming economically in Finland, don't you? You should be able to grasp the concept that no matter how much money you transfer some regions are more likely to remain less productive than others.

&gt; Second - short term risk sharing a) it is not short term, it is long term. As I said, the problem with the lack of competitiveness of the south for example will not go away. And, risk sharing is money transfer. The Finns will have to pay for your risk, your interest rate - for a long time.

You did not understand what the proposed solution entails. Under that solution, Finland does not pay even one eurocent unless everything comes tumbling down in an unorganised manner. If after we solve the current thing we decide that we don't want fiscal transfers, it should be pretty straightforward to transfer the risks back to the national central banks and we each go our separate ways. But not during the middle of the crisis. 

&gt; Do you think any country in the north will vote yes to what you are suggesting? I very much doubt it, so personally I think the best solution is for either the north and the south to leave - sooner than later because it is not like it going to get easier. 

What did I say? Sure, they could vote yes for it, as a temporary solution, until we decide if we want more integration or less. If your question implies if these countries would go for full fiscal transfers, I'd wager they'd say no; I think your concerns are indicative of the average opinion in these countries.",0,1367435910,null,0,false,0,c9qhbtc,t3_1dgxhq,t1_c9qhbtc,t1_c9qgw8z,null,1431358495,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; Because the guy talks about Greece and the Finns have an AAA rating plus have followed the rules every year. They have already have to borrowed more to pay of the bailouts that the Maastricht treaty forbids, and now you want to raise their interest rate to, and possibly even ask them to shoulder Greek debt. Why should the Finns pay for anything of Greece, above what is explicitly stated in the treaty? 

You are misrepresenting my views again. I'm not going to repeat the same things again and again. I never said anything about temporary fiscal transfers. That economics professor made a suggestion that entailed ECB issuing its own bonds; that does not directly affect the interest rates of Finland or their budget. 

&gt; Well, that is then the choice of the Finns to make, not of the Eurozone or the EU, since it goes against the rules. So, then it should be made on a country, voluntarily basis then? 

I did not say otherwise. 

&gt; And, that could be a claim that one makes for the whole world. I mean, I might personally prefer to help Bangladesh or Brazil since my money might have much more of an impact there and Brazil is really much more of a new emerging market than south of Italy for example. 

&gt; So, that argument don't really stand, does it? Why should southern Europe be prioritised with tax money, above what they are already receiving? And, for the ""no country is an island"" argument - why should southern Europe then receive more money than other interesting regions?

That's an interesting proposal and yes I do think that such a scheme should eventually be expanded to cover the whole world. I agree that Bangladesh deserves it more than Greece. Still, we need to extinguish the little fire in our own back yard before we make an attempt to save the whole world. 

&gt; the worst case that has happened over and over again? Everyone knows that there is no way in hell Greece can even pay back their own debt, and they even got a debt shaving in 2012. 

Greece falling behind in competitiveness was the obvious outcome of the currency union in hindsight, not the worst case. I was talking about the worst case under the proposed scheme. Are you saying that ""since the worst case happened once with Greece then it will happen again?"" That's not a logical argument.

Greece indeed cannot pay its own debts unless someone constantly guarantees it. That's what the scheme above does. The ECB pays some of the debts of Greece and then Greece slowly repays the ECB the difference. Everyone wins, no money is lost by anyone.

&gt; C), you are dodging the fact that the Finns because of this will pay a higher interest rates, as will the Dutch etc which translates to billions of Euros, in transfers to the south. 

I'm not dodging that, I'm denying it. Under that specific plan, this thing will not occur at all. The magic of shuffling numbers around. 

&gt; It goes against the treaty - You do not seem to care that the treaty states that each state takes care of its own shit basically. 

&gt; I do grasp that, I think everyone does. However, that is why the treaty explicitly states - no transfers, since transfers, within and without of the country is an endless source of irritation etc.

&gt; Don't you think that should be respected then? It is a the demcratically decided treaty which you think should be ignored - how can you ignore democracy? 

&gt; You can not just ignore the law because it is inconvenient at the moment! How would that look - as I said, Denmark decides not to pay the fee because it is inconvenient, France shit on the nuclear treaties, and Sweden decides to try capital punishment ""just because it suits us better"". Is that the world your advocating? If not, why is it OK to break the law in your case, but not any other? 

This is all correct. However, the treaty was ill-conceived and the rules it imposed were arbitrary. Nevertheless, I don't mind bending the rules if it means less people will suffer, I acknowledge that. According to the treaties, the thing we are experiencing was impossible to happen. We are treading unknown territory.

Suppose you are using a computer programme and for some reason or other something occurs that is outside what the programmers had coded as possible. Now, the state of the software becomes increasingly corrupted because its internal assumption do not hold any more. In this situation, adhering to the original programming is pointless. You need to forcefully go around it. 

This is, regrettably, the state of affairs in the EU. We can stick to the original programming, it sure is possible and perhaps noble. But it's irrational, it will end up hurting us all. 

&gt; So, why have the happened to the money that the EU cohesion fund have spent on southern Europe in the last 25 years? Why isn't southern Europe more competitive? Estonia has made greater strides in a decade, than Greece for example in 25 years. All regions are not alike, but I can expect them to improve in the same rate, but that is not the case, not at all. So, if southern Europe want more money, I'd like to know what has happened with the money from the last 25 years, and why they haven't made the improvement eastern Europe has.

What makes you so sure that the improvements in, say, Greece are negligible compared to the improvements in Eastern Europe? I don't see much of a difference really. It just happened that Greece was the weakest link in the eurozone. What is your evidence of all that?

&gt; The ""thing"" as you call it is not something you can solve quickly? Just for fun, how are you going to get Greece, Portugal and Spain competitive in 2 years, which is generally what one mean with short term. Pay off the debt? So, fiscal transfers for two years and then out? Do you honestly believe that yourself? 

Of course they won't become competitive in the just a few years. As for the rest, you're forcing me to repeat myself: that guy's proposal never was fiscal transfers for two years. It was a ECB-facilitated lending. The debt obligations would be easy to be broken up if we broke up the euro. The debt obligations would simply be transferred to the national central banks like all other assets of the ECB.

&gt; Second - it is not up to you to decide if you want fiscal transfers. It is up to the transfer countries, and the people of the EU. We have a right to vote about it, since it is against the treaty. 

For the umpteenth time, I did not ask for fiscal transfers and I did not say any scheme would be unilaterally decided by the debtor countries. Good grief! 

&gt; You said temporary fiscal transfers. I doubt people will vote yes at all and I think you are right, there is a real tiredness and unwillingness for more bailouts, transfers etc. Since the competitiveness is hardly magically going come back, my advice would be to leave the Euro - decades more of what is happening now in southern Europe is hardly a fun prospect. Better to take one's destiny in one's own hand then, not let it be controlled by Euro bureacrats. I honestly think that is southern Europe's best shot, because this crises isn't going anywhere anytime soon. 

I agree that it's a possible way. It's backwards because I'd really like the world to become more united but it sure is better than the current situation. It would be best in the medium term, hell in the short term and disappointing in the long term for everyone involved.

Since I too am an elementary Italian student, I really expected to feel isolated and overwhelmed when being out in public, always being surrounded by a language that I really don't know. But, I've actually found that not being able to understand everyone around me all the time is kind of peaceful. However, you might find that a bit depressing, not being able to connect with people so easily.

Again, not so much culture shock, but Italian attitudes towards food can be very different from our perspective. They have certain culinary rules that just aren't so important in the US. For example, a waiter told me recently that in Italy, the only foods you can eat with your hands are bread, pizza (even this is iffy), and chicken cooked on the bone. Rabbit cooked on the bone is sometimes an exception. I made pancakes and bacon for some Italian friends recently and they ate the bacon with a fork. It was adorable.

In a similar vein, when you go to the grocery store, you must wear a plastic glove to pick up fresh fruits and vegetables. And in some instances, this also applies to bread. I'm glad that my husband gave me the heads-up about this before I went to the store for the first time.

People here don't generally make eye-contact and smile to strangers on the street. I never realized how much I smiled at strangers before I came here. It was a hard habit to break.

I'm not actually living in Florence--I'm living in Siena. I highly suggest that you visit Siena while you're in Florence. It's a short train ride (about 1.5 hrs or less) and only costs about 9 Euro (each way). It's a beautiful medieval city, and while it's quite close to Florence, it's really very different.

Following trends . . . Greece Debt to GDP ratio(most important indicator for debt) . . has fallen from 170+% in 2011, to 156% at end of 2012 and  is predicted to reach 130% by end of 2013. . following this trend it will reach around 75% around 2017 which is German level of GDP/Debt. By 2020 Greece has the possibility to not only have no debt but have a surplus of trillions of Euros . . and that is because.

http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/hopes-for-greek-offshore-natural-gas-reserves

Norway just completed a 50 million survey of Greece last month and has said that there are extremely positive signs of massive gas fields in greece . . . this is also combined with University of Crete geologists who have done personal surveys around Crete/Rodos and found Massive Gas bubbled poking through the surface and have said that there is a  minimum of 1 trillion$ in gas in Crete alone. 

The norway survey did not search around Crete so both combined + other unknown finds means there could be an estimated 3+ trillion$ in gas.

Now combined that with the fact that Greece is having a record tourist year this season and many think the tourism sector is barely pushed to its limits . . . there is potential for 50+ million tourists a year by 2020.

Now combined that with the fact that Greece owns 40+% of the entire worlds shipping fleet which means Greece is the entire backbone of the worlds shipping sector + Chinese is investing tens of billions in Piraeus port means there is massive potential for greek domination in shipping.

Greece produces the best organic food on earth and has the potential to create the worlds biggest organic food market on earth. For example Greek yogurt was unknown 5 years ago and now it is in the top 5 most popular foods on earth right now . . Greek olive oil . . . honey . . . coffee and countless other amazing food products . . China has only just discovered greek food  and they are going crazy there and have potential to triple Greek food production by 2018 . . now combine that with greece controlling World shipping and there is a nice major industry there THAT WILL NEVER FAIL . . unlike tech industrys or other manufacturing . . . greek food will be sought after until the end of human existence. 

Many other things I can think of but I think that is enough for you to process for now . . .

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;I never said anything about temporary fiscal transfers. That economics professor made a suggestion that entailed ECB issuing its own bonds; that does not directly affect the interest rates of Finland or their budget. 

Sigh - to fix Greece you need way more than bonds, it is ridicoulous to suggest that it would not entail transfers. Second, for the umpteenth time for me as well, the interest rates of the ECB depends on the actions of the ECB of course. If it is known that they have to take on and issue bonds for to help Greece, it will be an economic burden on the Eurozone and on the ECB. That will raise the interest rates a few points - *which will costs the north billions*. You can compare it to the raise in interest rates when West/East Germany joined. Much more obvious  in that case of course, but the principle is the same. If Iceland (economic uncertainty) joined Norway (richest bloody country in the world) their interest rates would go up a few points to for the world would now know that an increased cost had joined Norway and the norwegian bank and state would have to take that into account. To say that the ECB interest rate would be unaffected by the move that the professor is suggesting is a incorrect, whatmore, then you do not know the market - are you saying that they wouldn't care one bit? 

Second - it goes directly against the ECB statue, and the rule of law. The ECB statue explicitly states that one shall not intervene on behalf of individual countries. If they did this, it would not only be illegal and extremely undemocratic, it would also increase the uncertainty of how the ECB act, thus raising the costs even more. For example, an investor might think like this - ""OK, the ECB do not care about this law, so what about the their other mandates?. Shit, they will probably start printing money like idiots now, and the inflation will increase. And I wanted a safe investment. Shit, I'll sell it and I'll buy Swedish or Swiss papers, at least I know they are dedicated to fighting inflation"". 

Investors like certainty, or as much certainty they can get. If the ECB start juggling like this, it increases the uncertainty. Thus, the costs will rise, for the Finns as well, despite what you say. The fact is, that Greece is a big uncertainty, has junk credit rating and is a huge cost to the Eurozone and the EU. 


&gt;The magic of shuffling numbers around. 

You can not fix Greece by shuffling numbers, you will only cost other countries tax payers money too. To really fix Greece will take several decades, and in the end, it can only be done by the Greeks. I honestly think however that the situation could be improved by leaving the Euro, the Euro is killing the Greeks. By that I mean that even if the Greeks have fucked up majorly (borrowing heavily, not investing etc) the Euro construction in itself has damaged Greece as well, it is not all because of ""lazy Greeks"" or whatever the tabloids write, I hope you understand I do not think so. It will take a long time to regain the Greek competitiveness, but it will take that much longer in the Euro, since all you can do there is cut the costs. Another thing that the Greeks *really, really* have to fix is the corruption ( and I have no doubt that the average Greek hates it). It is detrimental to the whole society, but also, why whould anyone want to give more money to a country if you do not know where the money ends up. 


&gt;Still, we need to extinguish the little fire in our own back yard before we make an attempt to save the whole world. 

No, not really. Why? That fire can be fixed by Greece leaving. 

&gt;What makes you so sure that the improvements in, say, Greece are negligible compared to the improvements in Eastern Europe? I don't see much of a difference really. It just happened that Greece was the weakest link in the eurozone. What is your evidence of all that?

Because of the economical indicators, like growth, economic freedom, corruption etc? Look at Estonia, and look at Greece for example. Estonia didn't even exist when Greece started to receive money from the EU. How come that they are now paying off Greece's  debt? 



&gt;his is all correct. However, the treaty was ill-conceived and the rules it imposed were arbitrary. Nevertheless, I don't mind bending the rules if it means less people will suffer, I acknowledge that. According to the treaties, the thing we are experiencing was impossible to happen. We are treading unknown territory.

You can not be sure that less people will suffer? How do you measure that? And, if you have that as measurement, any country can use that for not fullfilling their obligations. Perhaps less people will suffer if no one follow the environmental rules? Or, that is a good argument for both torture and capital punishment or not just paying any of the fees. 

What makes Greece so special that the rules should be bent for them? Any country can make the claim you just did. In fact, Estonia is poorer than Greece, yet they pay off your debt. Personally, Bulgaria has it worse - why shouldn't they have the rules bent? Or just the Romas? 

Also, democracy suffer if one bends the rules. That is more important in the long run, because otherwise we have nothing. Nothing can be built if we ignore the law and democracy, and the suffering will increase tenfolth.

I am a bit surprised by how you want to go around democracy and the law. Otherwise you seem to be a level headed person, albeit one I don't agree with on economical matters :-). But, just to claim that you have the right to ignore law and democracy just because.... -You realise of course that the same can be said for every single country in the EU, we all have problems of some type.  No law when Greece doesn't want to - that is not the way to build anything, and hardly the way to make the north more inclined to pay for you. 

&gt;It would be best in the medium term, hell in the short term and disappointing in the long term for everyone involved. 

I agree with hell in the short term, good in the medium term but I do not agree with disappointing in the long term. Why? The Greeks would have a chance to their own destiny - it could be good. At least they wouldn't be subjected to the Eurobureacrats, which I don't think anyone likes, or the stiffling rules of the Euro. The Greeks could do as they god damn pleased, and that can be a good thing.

If it is known that they have to take on and issue bonds for to help Greece, it will be an economic burden on the Eurozone and on the ECB. That will raise the interest rates a few points - which will costs the north billions.

I don't see how the ECB's interest rates have any effect in the ""north""'s bottom line. Can you explain that part? My understanding is that the ECB has its own books and is not financed by the member states. 

&gt; Second - it goes directly against the ECB statue, and the rule of law. 

I already explained that the spirit of the ECB stature cannot be upheld without causing all sorts of problems. I'm sure the letter of the law can be upheld depending on the wording of each new scheme. The only honest way to uphold it would be to dissolve the eurozone. I respect your opinion that you want that, but not everyone shares that. 

Also, I don't think investors would go crazy if a central bank started acting like a central bank. I don't think they care all that much for rules and regulations. 

&gt; You can not fix Greece by shuffling numbers, you will only cost other countries tax payers money too. [...]

You are conflating the moral problem with the economic problem. The economic problem can be put in suspended animation with shuffling numbers around. The deep-seated corruption and stuff obviously cannot be fixed fast but it is not instrumental to the economic problems. 

&gt; No, not really. Why? That fire can be fixed by Greece leaving. 

I agree that Greece leaving the eurozone is better than the current situation. But other eurozone countries don't want that because it would likely create a domino effect that would wipe out the whole eurozone. So they strive to make Greece's exit as painful as possible. If you convince your government and the governments of other eurozone countries to allow Greece to leave the eurozone and default on good terms, then I'm all for it. 

&gt; Because of the economical indicators, like growth, economic freedom, corruption etc? Look at Estonia, and look at Greece for example. Estonia didn't even exist when Greece started to receive money from the EU. How come that they are now paying off Greece's debt? 

[Read this](http://www.reddit.com/tb/1dig0v)

&gt; Also, democracy suffer if one bends the rules. That is more important in the long run, because otherwise we have nothing. Nothing can be built if we ignore the law and democracy, and the suffering will increase tenfolth.

I think you are overstating your case. The eurozone countries jointly deciding to temporarily ignore an obsolete treaty they all signed some time ago is not such a huge blow to either democracy or the rule of law. It's not like Greece will impose any temporary solution like this on its own; it would have to be jointly agreed. 

&gt; I do not agree with disappointing in the long term. Why? The Greeks would have a chance to their own destiny - it could be good. 

I guess. Since we were talking about the long term, I allowed myself to talk about philosophical principles and things like that. The general point is that if all us humans are not fundamentally different from each other, there's no difference between being altruistic to people in the same country and people in other countries since borders are meaningless.

This is why you see a lot of these parties coming forward now, populist and extreme in different ways and to different extents, but arising from a common origin. This explains UKIP, Front National, PVV, and Five Star, all charismatic anti EU parties. And slides from there towards out and out racism with True Finns and Golden Dawn.

Those centre ground leaders face an enormous challenge, because over the next few years they have to pilot European reform which is sufficiently moderate to be acceptable to national electorates in the short term (with major elections happening almost continuously one after another), and sufficiently radical to fix the faults which exist in the economic structure of the European economy and the single currency. That's a difficult balance to find, and they don't have that long to turn things around. We're already 5 years into the crisis. Countries like Spain and Greece will not tolerate 30% unemployment for decades.

You don't think 9/11 was the first American terror attack that spawned bullshit conspiracies, did you? Take a look in /r/conspiracy to see any sneeze linked to covert government agents.

The following is an apt description of what must be a very fine Telegraph reporter:

&gt; At his best, Evans-Pritchard practices journalism the way creationists interpret science. Was the “Piltdown Man” a hoax? Very well then, Darwin and a century’s worth of supporting evidence stand refuted, and creationism is proved. Do inconsistencies exist among the hundreds of eyewitness accounts of the Oklahoma City tragedy? They do. Were there ongoing investigations of other white supremacist, anti-government extremists in the region at the time of the bombing? Absolutely. To Evans-Pritchard, these constitute all the evidence he needs to posit a massive government conspiracy. In the real world, of course, eyewitness accounts of so devastating an event are often confusing and contradictory, and wild rumors inevitable. The hard work of law enforcement (and journalism) comes in sorting things out. Seamless consistency is a state achieved only by conspiracy theorists, assisted by the twisted reporting of an Evans-Pritchard.",0,1367455538,null,0,false,0,c9qoiky,t3_1dhx9m,t1_c9qoiky,t1_c9qm446,null,1431355108,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5
true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; Second, these are very small and open economies. The more open the economy the larger is the portion of output not dependent on recession-hit domestic spending. This makes, external adjustment a more potent alternative to domestic stimulus than in larger economies.

That's a point that I see made to a surprisingly small degree. Austerity is effectively a beggar thy neighbour policy. It might be in the interests of a handful of countries, when they can rely on overwhelming demand from outside, but it fails as more and more countries within a trading bloc undertake it at the same time, or indeed with countries large enough to be comparable to a trading bloc, notably the US. 

You could make the same point about Germany and Europe. Germany learnt its lesson in the 2000s that it could cut labour costs, increase competitiveness, and move from being a sick man to an economic powerhouse. But it was pursuing this policy while operating within a European and developed-world economy [which was growing at a decent pace](http://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=k3s92bru78li6_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ngdp_rpch&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=country:US:DE&amp;idim=country_group:998&amp;ifdim=world&amp;tstart=894063600000&amp;tend=1335913200000&amp;ind=false), and at a time when their currency was undervalued, with loose monetary policy. 

Now, it might well be that some countries do genuinely have competitiveness problems which need to be resolved, but in that case the reduction in domestic demand which comes from austerity must be compensated by stimulus elsewhere. Ultimately, Germany cannot apply lessons appropriate for an 80m population country to a 500m population trading bloc.

I have an opportunity to take a C1 shortly, but part of what i want to know is if that would help me at all here. I.e. having the certificate.

I have a decent resume when it comes to tutoring/teaching (test prep), though I lack any formal certifications in that area. I'm working on getting a little bit of experience with teaching ESL in the meantime (nothing yet, but hoping to get a little bit over this summer). I really just want to go for a year in order to gain complete mastery of the language and to do something interesting for a gap year. To add to that, I'm a recent grad, in my early 20s, etc. and so forth. As someone without a lot of experience in any set industry (except perhaps ""tutoring""), this seemed like the most practical way for me to get permission to stay for a year.

As such I don't really have to support a family or worry about establishing myself long term or ""making a living"" in the formal sense.

This is also why I'm hesitant about getting a certification in TEFL because the cost doesn't seem practical. I intend to live frugally. If I was in it for the long haul dropping 3 grand on a CELTA (though really, more like 5-6 MINIMUM when you consider wages lost while getting it) would be a no brainer since if it meant even $1,000 more/year, I'd pay for it eventually. I can live off 5 grand for quite some time, so risk/reward doesn't necessarily seem worth it to me, but I guess that's what I want to really find out. If it is worth it, or if I can do it another way. If I can make enough to do just a little better than break even after I've paid for food, insurance, rent in a WG, etc. then it would be worth it to me. I'm hoping to save enough to live for about 6 months if I was making nothing. So if I make enough to cover all my costs, I should be in business.

I'd be happy to send you a copy of my resume stripped of some personal info if you think you'd be able to give me a little bit more info.",0,1367457144,null,0,1367457514,0,c9qp292,t3_1ddwv1,t1_c9qp292,t1_c9qnir1,null,1431354778,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

The point is that no one *has* done it because they would be immediately crushed. It's effective as a deterrent.

Once upon a time? Probably the Soviets.

But unfortunately you can't make history happen in a vacuum. We don't know how the last 60 years would have panned out with the United States being the de-facto world military power.

One nation being so strong that other nations can't even realistically *aspire* to be the lead military power would have a pretty major impact on the course of history.

My advice to you is not to run if you're going to drink/party all night. You'll be dead tired when morning comes and you probably won't be in a good shape to run. This is serious stuff, most people that go there for running actually get some rest and prepare their run very carefully. There have been accidents and deaths, it's to be taken very seriously. So it's up to you to decide what you want to do, run and party afterwards or party only.

For accomodations, most hotels in the city will probably already be full or very expensive. It's easier to sleep in the parks in the city, or in an area where you can put a tent. You may try hotels outside the city but I don't know if it's very convenient.
