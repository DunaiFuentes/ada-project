Those statements contradiction each other.  Is cultural diversity a detriment to our success or the reason for our successful tech companies?  We attract skilled immigrants and aren't ashamed to admit it. 

Also, we have top-notch universities and leading tech companies.  For example: Harvard, Stanford, Yale, the University of Texas, Google, Genentech (recently purchased by a Swiss company but American in origin), and Microsoft.

&gt;the US military has severe structural problems and the only reason it has any success is due to its experienced sergeantry and budget

The US is the only military superpower in the world, whether or not it has problems.  And yes, clearly that is because of its massive budget and the training/experience of its personnel.  What else would allow a large and powerful military other than the allocation of immense resources and skill for military purposes?

Being technologically advanced doesn't make up for a cultural dilemma that holds the nation back. Prime example, Trayvon Martin. The shooting brought out a lot of the cultural deadlocks that the US is experiencing, and I shouldn't have to explain that bit any further.

American Universities are good, but if you think that they're the best in the world then you don't know much about universities. Europe offers excellent education that easily rivals that of America.

The US has a pretty poor military tradition. A lot of factors contribute to America's survival, one of them being the geographical location. Two oceans to serve as moats, and a plethora of natural resources. Another is the fact that the US very rarely tangled with a superpower.

To put it into perspective, European nations spend significantly less on their military forces, but they still pump out technology that can rival that of the US and they still do quite well in the type of warfare that we are facing today, all without spending Australia's yearly GDP worth on researching a stealth fighter that's behind schedule and failing. Whoa, I almost left out that the DoD makes its decisions based on the whims of lobbyists, but that's a separate issue.

The last semester is when you do your thesis. The nice thing about Germany ( at least the programs I know) is that there is no oral defense for Master's, just a written thesis. The classes were mostly quite good, and there are lots of opportunities to go on field trips. 

I have no idea what you are looking at studying, and I don't know much about the humanities and arts programs but if you're interested in science, I think Germany has some really interesting opportunities.

Next, I didn't say that the US has the best universities in the world.  I just said that many of them are top-notch, and they are.  Nothing in my post implied that Europe doesn't also have top-notch universities.

It's a continuous process though and since the Finnish border is also the EU border, you'd think that the EU would pay a large part of the investments. Unfortunately this has not been the case.

Finland is turning more towards Russia these days anyway, as the EU seems doomed. It's ok for Germans to pay through their nose as their industries also benefit from the situation. Finland is a little unlucky in this respect, and it's clear that Finland would do better outside of the EU. What I don't understand is why we are still a member.

European nations could have pulled off Libya without the US's help, American missiles only sped up the defeat of the Libyan government, it would have toppled with or without America in the picture. The Balkans are a twenty year old story, since then Germany, France, and the UK have acquired the technology required for a bombing campaign like that, look at Libya. Syria is also a special case, but the only meaningful kind of intervention would be in the form of ground forces, and ground forces are where European nations excel. The US does maintain a larger fleet and air force, but as a major pacific power that's to be expected and required. The US succeeds because of its Navy and its Air Force, the Marines and Army have numbers going for them but I'll be surprised on the day that America can field better infantry than that of the Brits, and even the war shy Germany still has high quality troops despite the bumps in the road.

We're taking steps in those directions.  For example, the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).  I agree that there are still lots of problems regarding wealth inequality.

&gt;at its core this nation is a failure that runs because the suits in charge keep the money flowing and the people subjugated.

No, that is false.  The US does not persist as a country only because people are subjugated and exploited; that implies that the American people don't have a sense of national identity or patriotism.  If anything, the US has too much patriotism.  American identity isn't an idea imposed from the top down.

On the topic of the military, Europe still relies on the US for assistance in most, but not all, of its military actions.  The idea that Europe could've handled Libya or, hypothetically, Syria, without the US is contrary to the histories of those events.  In other words, they did not handle them in a self-sufficient manner.  When Europe achieves military self-sufficiency in practice, not just in theory, I'll believe it.

I think the US should spend less on its military; a lot of military spending is nothing but corporate welfare.  My intention is not to boast about the US military or argue for the status quo, just to point out that your descriptions of European militaries are misleading.  Europe (France and Britain) do have some elite military forces.  Is Europe as a whole militarily equivalent to the US?  No, not at all, not even at small-scale modern conflicts like Libya or (hypothetically) Syria.

It explain how China is a natural empire. China is extremely diverse and huge. But their civilization does not self identify based on race as we know it, instead they identify based on their cultural identity. And this is why China is so old and huge, and has built projects which took centuries to complete.

The Roman empire is the only thing we have in Europe that comes close to that. Roman roads spanning Europe are the only thing that resembles Chinese canals built over huge distance and time spans.

New world nations like the US and Brazil are actually nation states like those we have in Europe, but that's because they largely replaced the native population. And ended up with almost continent sized nation states.

If Europe as a civilization is to hold its own against China and the US over a very long time, then we need to be together and identify in some way as one civilization. 

To me that means European history, science, and culture. Often this is restricted to the Western Tradition, but as someone from Eastern Europe, I don't agree with that. To me ancient Greece, ancient Thrace and the Byzantine empire are all just as much part of Europe. And this Eastern Tradition to me only makes Europe's history and culture larger and more interesting.

Over the last 100 years the US has really pulled ahead of Europe in a lot of things, including science, by being both more tolerant in the past, Einstein had to leave Germany, and more recently by centralizing funding on their higher education.

I know European scientists working in US universities, strictly because that's where the funding is.

I hope the EU can agree to centralize its funding. Much like we've done with CERN with great success, discovering the Higgs Boson.

And I hope we can maintain a strong European identity and hold our own against the super states of the future.

true,ravingraven,GREE,Greek living in Germany,"I can't say that I agree with you.

We Greeks are world champions in sticking to the ancient past to fish up personalities, ideals and ideas to be proud of. And from experience I can tell you that this is propably a bad idea. The reasons are that:

* Romans (and ancient Greeks) lived a long long long time ago. Back then things were different. We tend to identify with the good things that stood the test of time and reflect in today's world but that is (as /u/pinegenie pointed out) nitpicking. Did the acient Greeks have Democracy? Sure (sort of) but only if you were a male, non-slave, Athenian. And even then only for certain parts of the executive and law-making process of society.

* Again: Romans (and ancient Greeks) lived a long long long time ago. Since then (and thanks to colonization) what remained of their influence got spread out to a lot of places (most notably, the USA) and stopped being a clear cut European thing.

* Many of the ideals you mention (liberty, equality) do not need anything to stand on. We have evolved our understanding of the human condition to the point where those ideals are self-evident. They do not need a glorious past to be validated (and it is at least ironic to speak of equality and liberty in a society where slavery was a thing.)

* People that do not identify with those ideas can just as easily twist the popular image we have of the Romans to increase the appeal and validate their ideas. Since you are German you must be extremely familiar with those scenes:

http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-46i-HQO0Er8/UNnQ8ewaSjI/AAAAAAAAuZA/9ejBwrYKEBQ/s1600/myphoto.jpeg

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Bellamy_salute_1.jpg

Funnily enough, the neo-nazis in my country are using the ""Roman Salute"" (which never existed in the Roman times, by the way) as an ""Ancient Greek Salute to Apollo"" (equally ridiculous) thereby ""validating"" their actions as actions taken from a time when Greece was important. Claims of ancestry from people who lived during that time also validate ""good Greek blood."" Thus, the reverse can be true as well. People who have never seen a mathematics book in their lives claim they are superior because their ancestors ""invented mathematics.""

Clinging to the past can be a dangerous thing. We have the knowledge and opportunity to be greater than the Romans ever were. We (everyday, ordinary Europeans) understand philosophical and ethical ideas and possess powers of reasoning that the average Roman would never even dream of. We have technology that would be perceived as magic back then. We are indeed in the position to solve most of the world's problems and explore space if we would so choose.

Maybe instead of looking at the past it would be a better idea for you to start looking to the future.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;the shutdown that it partially caused does shed light on a pretty big problem, wouldn't you say? Tyranny of the minority is a bit extreme, but it's not completely off.

Yes, it does indicate a big problem (tyranny of the minority), but I need to quibble about your phrasing.  Obamacare didn't ""partially cause"" the shutdown.  As you correctly noted, the shutdown was an artificial crisis created by the Republican minority in the House for political purposes.  They threatened to make the US default because they thought that Obama and the Democrats would surrender to their demands, at least in part, as they have so often in the past.  Fortunately, Obama has gained experience as a leader and did not play that game this time.

The ""tyranny of the minority"" problem stems from America's history.  Originally, the various state governments had more autonomy.  They feared that the federal government would grow more powerful and infringe on their independence.  The federal government was therefore set up to allow a minority in Congress to wield a lot of power for the purpose of letting a minority of states keep the federal government from harming their interests.

I imagine that a federal Europe will have the same problem.  If a significant minority of European states want to block federal action, it will probably be blocked.  Powerful states like Germany and France will surely insist on that kind of power for minority factions so that they don't have coalitions of smaller states (like Greece, Portugal, Bulgaria, etc) dictating policy to them.

&gt;On the topic of military power, Europe is self sufficient in terms of defense.

I agree.

&gt;Regarding Warren, maybe her passions speaks to you, I find her to be about as inspiring as Merkel, which isn't a compliment.

If anyone is interested, [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY4fo-_TRS8&amp;hd=1#t=08m22s) shows her passion.  I've linked to a specific portion, but you can move to the beginning if you want to see more of it.  It also shows that she is more left wing than most American politicians.  The context is the campaign for Obama's re-election in 2012.

Europe on the other hand is multiple nations. And that's what Rome was. It was an empire spanning many peoples and religions, but they were all made part of Rome.

But Rome eventually fell apart, China did not. The difference is probably due to geography, probably.  But I think today, geography will not be holding us back. And in the near future, unless we unify I don't think we can withstand super states like China. 

Germany alone seems huge in the EU, but alone against China and the US things are very different. Imagine a near future China, its economy many times bigger than that of the US. Now imagine how a trade war would look like between it and any single European country? You either agree to what ever China wants or become extremely isolated.

Cela les a, par suite, conduits à avoir un taux de croissance inférieur à leur taux de croissance optimal et explique pourquoi certains pays comme l’Italie ou le Portugal ont connu une croissance très faible. De fait, ces pays ont perdu sur les deux tableaux : en compétitivité et en niveau de croissance.


On va pas avancer si tu lis pas ce que je dis. Je ne conteste pas que l'inflation a un effet sur l'économie. Par contre ce que ca fait c'est que tout coute plus cher pour les pauvres. Il ne faut pas croire que l'inflation c'est magique. Tu gagne en compétitivité parce que tu achetes a plus cher et tu vends a moins cher. 
C'est une perte nette en pouvoir d'achat (l'inflation est d'ailleurs principalement une mesure du cout des biens de consommation donc...)

&gt; Source ? Affirmer n'est par prouver. Et je croyais que le protectionnisme était d'un autre temps ? Merci de te contredire en 2 commentaires.

Par exemple la PAC est une mesure protectionnisme, les TVA fortes, les taxes de douanes. Il y en a beaucoup mais tu penses le contraire sans faire l'effort de vérifier par toi même.

 Je n'ai jamais dit que le protectionisme était d'un autre temps. Je dis que utiliser l'inflation + le protectionisme pour augmenter la compétitivité sur les industries a faible valeur ajoutée sont des mesures économiques non viables. Je dis aussi que refuser d'un bloc que l'économie est mondiale aujourd'hui est une stupidité sans nom et réactionnaire.

Je suis contre le libre échange personellement mais il ne faut pas croire que nous soyons dans le libre échange.

&gt; Par la création monétaire. La création monétaire a peu d'effet sur l'inflation en temps de crise. Les risques inflationnistes sont bien plus dus à l'envolée des prix des matières premières qu'à la politique monétaire et ils sont extrêmement faibles lorsqu'il y a un fort taux de chômage comme c'est le cas.

Tu n'as pas lu ta propre source... Je te l'ai cité.  Tu cite que l'inflation convergera, la source parle de convergence européenne. Ca ne contredit ni une forte inflation ni une forte baisse du pouvoir d'achat.

&gt; La création monétaire a peu d'effet sur l'inflation en temps de crise.

C'est principalement là que nos avis divergent. Je ne pense pas que le racisme soit aussi présent que ce l'on veut bien nous faire croire. Qu'il existe c'est une évidence, mais je pense que le principal stigma négatif concerne l'archétype ""mec de cité"" et sa tenue / attitude / langage.

Je ne pense pas qu'il y ai foncièrement de différence majeure de traitement entre un blanc en costard et un noir en costard, je pense même qu'un blanc en jogging lacoste sera bien plus facilement contrôlé  par la police / victime de discrimination qu'un noir en costard.

&gt; les élites de notre société maintiennent les pauvres dans leur pauvreté. Que ce sont aussi les pauvres qui sont le plus souvent délinquants, par effet de conséquence.

C'est une évidence, cela ne concerne pas uniquement les immigrés / descendants d'immigrés ceci dit. 

&gt;De plus, et tu me pardonneras la formule provocatrice (aux dépends de la véracité de celle-ci), être noir ou arabe en France est une conduite à risques.

Etre délinquant est une conduite à risque, être noir ou arabe, en soit, je ne sais pas. Considères tu que ma collègue d'origine algérienne qui bosse en tailleur a de bonnes chances de se faire taser dans la rue par rapport à un autre de mes collègues qui serait blanc ? Je pense que les deux ont relativement peu de chances d'avoir ce genre de problème.

Il s'est pris une balle parce qu'il avait un pistolet à la main même s'il ne le pointait pas sur la police ? C'est indéniablement une bavure, mais tu sais comment te procurer un pistolet sans permis toi ? Parce que moi j'en serais totalement incapable. Je ne dis pas qu'en soit porter une arme illégale ou voler une voiture mérite la mort, juste qu'il faut savoir que c'est une conduite à haut risque. 

&gt;J'aimerais citer l'article que j'ai le premier utilisé de nouveau si tu le permet pour te répondre :

Je l'ai lu la première fois et je ne suis toujours pas d'accord. Ce qui est assez logique étant donné que je ne suis pas d'accord avec le postulat de départ comme quoi le racisme est ""institutionnalisé"", je ne peux pas être d'accord avec la conclusion qui en découle comme quoi le racisme tourné vers les blancs soit sa réponse. Je pense que ce type de racisme est directement dû à l'action d'apprentis sorciers tels que S.O.S Racisme pour ne pas les citer qui soufflent constamment depuis plus de 25 ans sur les braises du communautarisme afin de monter les français entre eux pour servir un agenda politique. 

Pour ton expérience personnelle la mienne diffère mais comme tu le dis ce n'est pas vraiment un argument je ne m'étendrais donc pas dessus. 

&gt;Faudrait voir à ne pas surestimer un fait juste pour servir un agenda politique.

Certes, il ne faut pas non plus détourner les yeux. Lors d'une étude de l'INED de 2008 16% des personnes issues de la population majoritaire disaient avoir déjà été victimes d'une agression raciste.

All of it is open for interpretation... That said, sry, I'm really not into archaic and atavistic ideological divides, at all.

Good evening/morning. Guess I should provide some references/context for statements made above. 


*On greedy and corrupted cock-ups:*
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Lehman, Merrill Lynch (BAC), Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse, HSBC Holdings, Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland… all charged and under investigation. Not to say that the list doesn't go on. 


*Who run out of other peoples' money?*

See above, these entities still incinerate money; those who are open to interpretation won't have trouble with saying they are among the main beneficiaries of ''corporate bailout welfare''. 


*Who is burning billions in high furnaces of primary dealers with little to no effect on real economy?*

FED and ECB, and they're not hiding their unease about… ''fragmentation'' ([Where'd the Bailout Money Go? Shhhh, It's a Secret](http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/12/22/whered-bailout-money-go-shhhh-it-secret/) – AP).

And, of course, inhabited by diabetic and obese rednecks.

I think that's spot on. 

The average Frenchman's perception of the average American pretty much consists in all of the negative stereotypes attributed to Republican-leaning Southerners. What the French tend to ignore is twofold:

- that there also positive traits in Southern culture (hospitality, politeness, greater sense of community, it's easy to approach people, etc.). Some of my friends who have never been to the US would be stunned if they learned how big many Americans are on volunteering and on fostering a sense of community. Most French people assume that since there is no universal healthcare, there is no sense of solidarity, which in my experience is completely untrue.

- that there are significant regional differences in the US, including huge parts of the country which have a lot in common with Western Europe.",0,1382437874,null,0,false,0,ccx0b67,t3_1oqmry,t1_ccx0b67,t1_ccuu9kw,null,1429028960,0,false,france,t5_2qhjz,0

I would consider that far too much of a bad judgment on the Greeks. The romans adopted many many things from the Greeks, not only the transformed pantheon. I think you're overestimating the Romans and underestimating the Greek here.

I'm also not sure in how far the Romans really serve well as a model for us to emulate. The Roman mentality looked down on the barbarians and severely underestimated them (in contrast to Persia which they took seriously). There's a great amount of cultural chauvinism at work here. The Romans are also the opposite of a good role model in terms of democracy and integration.

Their idea of rule was to subject other peoples to their will and to exploit them. The social transformation this effected was totally incidental.

I will briefly elaborate one the most common form, which could be called ""skilled worker recruiting"". This is the process:

If a company has trouble finding qualified workers (esp. engineers, software developers, etc) they will make contracts with several Personalberatungen and tell them what kind of person they are looking for. The Personalberatung looks for candidates that might fight and then forward your CV and some information to the company.

Generally, the companies pays 100% of the fee if the applicant of a certain Personalberatung signs an employment contract. The fee is approximately 20% to 30% of the applicant in first year (depending on the position). Consequently it is very cheap for the applicants but quite expensive for the company. Companies will thing twice whether an applicant is worth it and candidates who apply directly to the same company will have better chances of getting a contract.

The Personalberatung has a high interest that their candidate is employed. Therefore, they try everything to make the recruitment process quicker, in order to get a signature before another / better candidate applies from somewhere else. (This is beneficial for you, too, of course)

An additional info for a fresh job-seeker: The fee will be relatively high for someone without practical experience. Thus you should start by initially writing some applications yourself...

On a besoin d'un peu d'inflation. Dans ce cas, les effets sont positifs sur l'économie et donc avec le système de répartition proposé par le FN sur les pauvres. Tu oublies la baisse du chômage, les effets sur les recettes de l'État et la dette, qui ont des conséquences positives sur les travailleurs.

Sans l'inflation, la solution est de baisser les bas-salaires, [comme l'a fait l'Allemagne](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24145126). En termes de pouvoir d'achat, la dévaluation proposée (et non l'inflation) est un meilleur modèle.

&gt;Il ne faut pas croire que l'inflation c'est magique.

C'est pour ça que le FN ne propose pas l'inflation mais avant tout la dévaluation. Dévaluation + sortie de l'euro + création monétaire + mesures productivistes sur certains secteurs conduisent à une stabilisation vers inflation structurelle de chaque pays. Aucun appauvrissement des pauvres donc mais au contraire équilibre vers un optimum impossible à atteindre avec la monnaie commune.

&gt;Je n'ai jamais dit que le protectionisme était d'un autre temps.

Tu as dit : *lois protectionistes d'un autre temps*.

&gt;Je dis que utiliser l'inflation + le protectionisme pour augmenter la compétitivité sur les industries a faible valeur ajoutée sont des mesures économiques non viables.

Ce n'est pas ce qui est proposé. Il est proposé de prendre des mesures pour la productivité, et de corriger des marchés défaillants avec une concurrence déloyale (par exemple le dumping chinois).

&gt;Je dis aussi que refuser d'un bloc que l'économie est mondiale aujourd'hui est une stupidité sans nom et réactionnaire.

Ce n'est pas le cas. Cite le programme au lieu de dire n'importe quoi.

&gt;Tu cite que l'inflation convergera, la source parle de convergence européenne.

Relis la phrase car visiblement tu n'as pas compris ce que tu lisais. L'inflation converge entre quoi et quoi ?

*les 
taux de change réels évoluent et tendent à converger car la dévaluation – ou réé-
valuation – initiale d’une monnaie est compensée, année après année, par un taux 
d’inflation plus ou moins fort, dû en partie à l’inflation structurelle et en partie à 
l’inflation – ou la déflation – importée.*

&gt;C'est peut être la chose la plus stupide que j'ai jamais lu.

Ce qui confirme le fait que tu n'y connaisses rien en économie.

L'instabilité et la faiblesse du lien entre création monétaire et inflation peuvent s'expliquer par plusieurs raisons.
En premier lieu, les innovations financières des années 1980–1990, en accroissant la liquidité des actifs, ont rendu la distinction entre monnaie et actifs non monétaires difficile à opérer : un agent peut, à la place de la monnaie au sens strict, thésauriser au moyen d'autres actifs comme des SICAV, inclus dans M2. 

Ces actifs sont donc très proches de la monnaie et ils en constituent un substitut. Par conséquent, les agents arbitrent entre ces actifs, ce qui a pour implication que le stock de monnaie connait d'importantes et brusques variations. Or la relation entre inflation et masse monétaire n'est étroite que si la vitesse de circulation de la monnaie est constante. Ainsi, la croissance des agrégats monétaires, surtout M1 et M2, n'a plus depuis la fin des années 1970 de relation stable avec l'inflation.

De plus, si la banque centrale peut contrôler directement M1, elle ne peut pas contrôler M2 : elle ne peut pas empêcher un agent d'acheter un actif financier inclus dans M2 à la place de la monnaie. Cela est d'autant plus problématique que certains économistes pensent avoir constaté que la simple annonce par les banques centrales d'un objectif pour un indicateur de masse monétaire peut entraîner la réaction des acteurs économiques, qui modifient leur comportement pour échapper à la contrainte monétaire, ce qui a pour conséquence d'enlever toute valeur à l'indicateur de masse monétaire, selon ce qui a été appelé la loi de Goodhart.

&gt; Unless distributions use the binary files supplied by Mozilla, fall within the stated guidelines, or else have special permission, they must compile the Firefox source with a compile-time option enabled that creates binaries without the official branding of Firefox and related artwork, using either the built-in free artwork, or artwork provided at compile time.[4]

true,[deleted],null,null,"The legacy of Rome has never stopped haunting our history. I think it's fair to say that the continuous reception of Rome is a more defining feature of our past and present than Rome's actual influence. Rome has rather been constantly renewed and reinvented, quite a lot like Christianity. Art, morality, philosophy, religion have all known eras of an intensified 'looking back' to the 'classics', remarkably enough these tended to be the most progressive eras of our intellectual history.

One aspect of society that has been kept perennially linked with the Romans was political legitimacy, the subject of your post. Whatever Rome really was, its constantly reviewed and renewed legacy became a source of legitimacy for monarchies and empires to republics, fascist states and revolutionary movements. 

For example;

Charlemagne called himself Imperator Augustus and was crowned as such by the Pope. The Pope at his turn believed to possess religious authority by a Roman Imperial decree; the donation of Constantine. Which was later proven a forgery by Lorenzo Valla, a disciple of Renaissance humanism; an intellectual movement that promoted the study of Roman and Greek texts.

Charlemagne's title lived on as Imperator Romanus Sacer, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. An Empire that encompassed an area largely untouched by Romans. Then this empire was overthrown by Napoleon; a man that managed to take absolute power after enlightenment ideals lead to the French Revolution. These ideas emphasized and idealized other aspects of Roman history, especially the republican period, civil law and citizenship.

During this time the Eastern Roman Empire, by all means the only direct successor to the Roman Empire still lived on. Until a Turkish conqueror took the capital and crowned himself ""Kaiser-i-Rum"", Roman Emperor. Although some centuries before a Flemish count already did that and crowned himself Emperor of the Romans.

Fascism comes from fasces lictoriae (""bundles of the lictors"") which symbolised power and authority (imperium) in ancient Rome. Fascism, especially Italian fascism was of course amply inspired by Rome. 

Maybe the most original adoption was the one by a revolutionary movement in Germany. But it didn't inspire itself on the Roman state or power, but on one of its greatest enemies; the leader of the greatest slave uprising against the Roman Republic, Spartacus. This was the German communist Spartacus league, whose Spartacist uprising experienced a similar fate to the Third Servile war.

These are just the more well known examples. The reason I found it interesting writing them down is to show that our Roman heritage is rather a reflection than something based in the actual Roman past.

Beside that, Roman history wasn't as rosy as you would present it. The principate and late republic honestly had more in common with a military dictatorship. Though the fact remains that it doesn't really matter. Even Spartacus didn't want to abolish slavery, but people just cherry pick and idealize the parts they like. As our own society changed, our view of Rome changed with it; what we emphasized and what we ignored.

Coming back to your quote, it's certainly a beautiful display of Roman republican patriotism. But the idea of basing our societies on this view is not new. The Roman Republic strongly inspired political theorists during the enlightenment who further elaborated these ideas. 

I'm not well read on this part of history but what you're promoting is essentially part of the value system of the enlightenment. The idea that morality and meaning of an individual comes from being part of a sovereign people. Or the idea of the social contract and the common good as guides to human virtue.

During the French Revolution these beliefs really culminated in a true secular religion: the cult of the Supreme Being of Robespierre. It promoted a type of civic minded, public virtue that could only be attained through active fidelity and democracy. According to Robespierre belief in a living god and a higher moral code were ""constant reminders of justice"" and thus essential to a republican society.

Whatever it is, it's antithetical to petty bourgeois individualist morality the West has today. So you have my support. Applying it however is a completely different matter. Few these days are ready like Robespierre to sacrifice themselves for the republic.

I was reminded of another story from Rome; the legend of the Horatii which was recorded by Livius. It's about a dispute between two warring cities; Rome and Alba Longa. Three brothers from a Roman family, the Horatii, agree to end the war by fighting three brothers from a family of Alba Longa, the Curiatii. The three brothers were all willing to sacrifice their lives for the good of Rome. It was most famously depicted in this painting from Jacques Louis David: [The Oath of the Horatii](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Jacques-Louis_David_-_Oath_of_the_Horatii_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)

Also neat is France's unofficial anthem approved by Robespierre: Le chant Du Depart. The chorus goes like this:


    La République nous appelle
    Sachons vaincre ou sachons périr
    Un Français doit vivre pour elle
    Pour elle un Français doit mourir.

So I have to be blindly supporting of the country I live in to be dignified? What happened to freedom of conscience?

&gt; But this is just too much. We shouldn't have a military? Like really?

Really? That's where I crossed the line for you? 

First of all, it's hardly my business what you do in your country. I clearly stated that demilitarisation is an *ideal* situation, and I know that it won't happen in my life time. 

But that doesn't mean conscript armies don't have to go, and I was talking about my country (btw: were you conscripted? were you force to serve in an organisation you absolutely disagreed with under threat of jail, and did you end up hospitalised because the army hierarchy wouldn't protect conscripts from abuse? had your country ever lost a third of its yearly GDP because of a military accident? have your country's generations of men seen their lifetime earning potential reduced because they had to serve in the army and leave their jobs for pointless follow-up training every year? - there's a study on that one, performed two decades ago, about UK's experience before and after abolishing conscription)

&gt; What if someone decides to attack us?

Again, I have said that demilitarisation is an *ideal* situation. 

&gt; You say our armies haven't stopped anyone. Maybe because they didn't have to? 

They had. In 1974. After starting the war *themselves*.  And they failed.

&gt; When has anyone attacked us?

1974.

&gt; How can you judge the army's efficiency if it was never tested?

Other than 1974, they pretty much have a dozen of serious military accidents every year. You begin to suspect that they might not know shit.

Ensuite, je ne vois pas comment des lois de préférence nationale alliée avec des mesures de dévaluation ne meneraient pas a une inflation. 

Logique : ca coute plus cher a produire, plus cher a importer, donc plus cher a acheter.

Si tu es en récession, les autres facteurs liés a la récession (baisse de la demande) créeront une baisse des prix, qui compensera l'inflation. 

La france n'est pas en récession, mais en stagnation.

Enfin vu que tu aimes parler de la forme et pas du fond: 
&gt;Tu as dit : lois protectionistes d'un autre temps.

le protectionisme &gt;&lt; des lois protectionnistes du FN. Merci de ne pas confondre.

Les lois protectionnistes pour relancer une industrie impossible a relancer en France sans faire du dumping salarial ou de l'inflation forte (ce qui revient au final au même pour la personne de base), sont stupides et arriérées.

Le tissu industriel de la France n'est PLUS fait d'industries a faible valeur ajoutée. Pour la relancer il faudrait des investissements forts et du dumping. 

Pourquoi chercher à concurrencer justement la Chine et les pays qui peuvent se permettre d'avoir une main d'oeuvre a pas cher, alors que l'ensemble des pays développés, qui eux ont une économie qui marche, misent sur les industries a forte VA (aerospace, automobile, nouvelles technologies). Tacher de sauver ou relancer ces éléments perdus ne peut conduire qu'a une catastrophe économique.

Où est dans le programme du FN, les relances économiques sur les industries nouvelles?

Looking at the [2009 EU election in Romania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2009_%28Romania%29) the party percentages were roughly equal to what you'd see in national elections, even if the turnout was low.

The one election that was anomalous was 2008 when the nationalist vote was split, and the GRP was in decline, but there was no serious contender (although Gigi Becali's party did take enough votes away so they could miss the 5% threshold).

The only ones who actually benefited from voter apathy were the Hungarian minority who have a much more disciplined voting population, and rose from the usual 6% to 8.6%.

Ci ho messo anni a capire che il tutto sia fondato solo sulla tradizione e sull'attaccamento al potere, e non ci sia nulla di ""rivelato"" in questa religione. Anche ammesso che Gesù sia esistito, anche ammesso (e non concesso) che abbia davvero fatto miracoli, anche ammesso che abbia detto solo cose buone e giuste, nulla di quello che ha detto giustifica lo stato in cui si trova la religione cattolica ora. Non ha mai parlato di contraccezione, di diritti della famiglia, di scuola, di politica, di santi, di purgatorio, di Papi, di messa domenicale, di confessione....

O le cure mediche che devono ancora essere sperimentate? (Vedi commento di /u/LuluWilson più sopra).

In ogni caso anche la coerenza integerrima di cui parli è un valore arbitrario, e in una società umana complessa secondo me ogni persona bene o male finisce per fare dei compromessi tra la propria coerenza e la necessità di sostenere un principio morale in cui crede. E' tecnicamente un'ipocrisia, però ci siamo immersi tutti, in modi diversi. 

Una tensione morale diffusa, anche se ""incoerente"", in questo caso può contribuire a risolvere una contraddizione in maniera più veloce: per esempio ottenendo che la ricerca di alternative alla sperimentazione animale sia posta più in alto nella scaletta delle priorità sociali, e vi siano quindi dedicate più risorse. E' quello che sta già succedendo anno dopo anno, con la messa al bando di tecniche di sperimentazione troppo crudeli ecc.

Mi sembra invece che l'approccio del ""male necessario"" sia un compromesso di segno inverso, sbilanciato verso la conservazione dello status quo. Mi sembra difficile che funzioni da motore propulsore per un cambiamento rapido.

Prejudice is in all European history textbooks, and last centuries interests still model historical views. 

History must not repeat itself, in my opinion, and taking past glorified accounts and transporting them to the present has always led to disasters. 

Our history is a history of rise and fall, we had fallen to the worse possible human calamities, and risen to the highest human values in the world, not once but many times. 

Europe has shaped the world in every sense, and new great nations like the US owe almost everything, politically, military, culturally to European culture and traditions. 

What Europe needs is not copying its past and repainting it. It needs a new stand. And we are on route for that, the missteps of a few years mean nothing in a historical context. I personally have no doubts that this is true and that Europe will still hold as the world center of the western culture, and that European citizens will still carry the status of the most humane, and self aware, free citizens in the world.

Tanto sicure che lo stesso governo americano *non ha mai negato la veridicità dei fatti*, ha solo tentato di minimizzare.

Quindi no, Riotta non ha *ragione da regalare*. Riotta è un servo del potere del cazzo che appena la fa fuori dal vaso italiano, dove se sei un giornalista con le spalle coperte ti è permesso di dire tutto senza contraddittorio, prende le tante mazzate in faccia che si merita.

Ancora una volta, mi chiedo chi upvoti ste cazzate.

&gt;È senz'altro impossibile creare una morale immobile, immutabile o universale, ma ci si muove più facilmente verso il progresso accettando di ""spostare"" la morale secondo le necessità che nascono in seno a una società di persone, piuttosto che basandosi su criteri utilitaristi che per definizione sono quanto di più lontano dal progresso. Io non vedo nessuna minaccia nel cambiamento. 

Chi vede minacce nel cambiamento? Non coloro che alla morale vanno contro perché convinti che li stia limitando nelle loro scelte di vita. Neanche coloro che, valutando i pro e i contro, decidono per una condotta piuttosto che per un'altra. Un criterio utilitaristico è valido come ogni altro; il tuo discorso mi pare ruoti intorno ad una tautologia: parli di ""necessità che nascono in seno ad una società di persone"" in contrapposizione ad un ""discorso utilitaristico"". Ebbene il discorso utilitaristico è parte integrante delle necessità di ogni società, che ci piaccia o no, non sono contrapposti. 


&gt;Non capisco, a quale dei miei tanti omicidi e crimini ti riferisci?

Stai spostando la questione dal piano argomentativo a quello personale, evidentemente. Mi pare chiaro che nel citare ""la tua bussola morale"" ho inteso dire ""la bussola morale di cui tu parli"". Tornando al punto: non ho nulla contro la ricerca di soluzioni alternative alla sperimentazione animale, purché tali alternative si dimostrino più efficienti, economiche e sostenibili. Rinunciare a questi tre criteri *utilitaristici* soltanto perché si considera immorale l'impiego di animali mi pare naive e controproducente.

In sintesi: la ragione per passare dalla sperimentazione animale ad una delle possibili alternative deve risiedere nell'effettiva utilità di tale scelta. Non è paura del cambiamento: è una questione di praticità.

No, ed è proprio questa la cosa gravissima secondo me. Siccome è ""la mia opinione"" non puoi pubblicare cose non vere.

&gt;  Lo Stato, in America come in Europa, utilizza gli stessi algoritmi che i motori del web usano ogni giorno su di noi (paradossalmente eBay, che assume Greenwald come paladino della trasparenza, è pioniera di queste tecniche informatiche…)

Qua, sperando che il lettore non sappia, ne spara una grossa grossa. Senza entrare nel merito (eBay fa quello che fanno Google e Facebook? WTF?), quello che fanno Google e Facebook è MOLTO diverso da quello che fa e ha fatto l' NSA.

&gt;  Come ha detto il capo dei servizi segreti inglesi MI5, Andrew Parker, l’impresa di Snowden «è un regalo immenso ai terroristi».

Perchè? Perchè lo dice chi è stato beccato con le mani nel vaso della marmellata?

&gt; La rete del fondamentalismo, attiva dall’Africa, al Medio Oriente, gli Usa e l’Europa, utilizza gli stessi modelli analitici della polizia e, una volta dedotto l’algoritmo usato per snidarli, può con facilità eluderlo e confonderlo. I Big Data sono arma letale a doppio taglio, chiunque può impugnarli. 

Qua ancora una volta confida nell' ignoranza del lettore per sostenere la cazzata sparata prima. Quello detto qua semplicemente non vuol dire niente - *dedurre l' algoritmo per snidarli* non dovrebbe neppure essere un costrutto grammaticale valido. 

E posso andare avanti. Il senso è che questo è un pezzo fazioso e diffamante nei confronti di Snowden e Greenwald, che invece di presentare onestamente opinioni (su cui il lettore, in teoria, dovrebbe poi formare un' opinione sua) passa una serie di cazzate per fatti.

L'idea della trasparenza totale (applicata in questo caso all'informazione) è qualcosa di profondamente illusorio: ci piace molto, perché all'assunto del potere cattivo che invano tenta di nascondere la verità al sacrosanto controllo del popolo virtuoso (e noi siamo sempre popolo e mai potere, quindi dalla parte conveniente dell'assunto) aggiunge la possibilità di ribaltare questo stato delle cose, esponendo le soperchierie del potere e rendendo ad esse giustizia.

Il problema è che si tratta in larga maggioranza di cose che, semplicemente, non devono essere sapute. L'insidia del mito della trasparenza totale qua sta: nel cementare la convinzione secondo cui è giusto e doveroso che tutto sia saputo da tutti. E non è così: il popolo (cioè io, te e la stragrandissima maggioranza dei viventi) è accomunato da una caratteristica: non sapere un cazzo (e di conseguenza non capire un cazzo) di come funziona il potere, con le sue zone grigie e le sue inconfessabilità. Nonostante ciò, in base non si capisce a che cosa, pretendiamo di dover conoscere, giudicare ed orientare cose a cui siamo del tutto estranei. Dice: scandalo, i servizi segreti spiano la gente. Ma è il loro mestiere, che altro dovrebbero fare? Se in tutto il mondo esistono i servizi segreti e da nessuna parte esistono i servizi palesi vorrà pur dire qualcosa oppure no?  Il punto è che il potere deve essere opaco e riservato, altrimenti non è. Il potere deve tramare nell'ombra e perseguire, anche con mezzi spiacevoli, gli obiettivi che ritiene necessari. Il potere deve avere i mezzi per tutelare questi obiettivi a qualunque costo (inclusa la possibilità di far trovare gente nel vicolo con un buco nella testa).

Mi rendo conto che per la nostra autostima funzioni molto meglio raccontarsi la storia del cittadino paladino della trasparenza ultimo argine all'infamia del potere, ma bisogna anche rendersi conto di come questo sia prendersi per il sedere da soli.

Un esempio per spiegarmi meglio può essere quello del Patto di Londra, che fu portato avanti da tre persone (Salandra, Sonnino e il Re) senza che nessun altro ne sapesse assolutamente niente. E non si trattava di bruscolini: si stava pensionando la Triplice, facendo un accordo con quello che in teoria era il Nemico per farci la prima guerra mondiale insieme, mettendosi d'accordo su cosa prendersi dopo e si stava dando la più grossa sterzata alla politica estera del Regno che ci fosse mai stata.

true,sayheykid24,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; Yes, among the anti-EU crowd. Hence why this plays well into the US' hands.

That's just conspiratorial bullshit. Markets are still worried that a country like Greece, Italy, or Spain would pull out of the Euro, and decimate its value. There is no ""anti-EU crowd"" in the US haha. It's really not something most people have even formed an opinion on. 

&gt;The dollar is far from being an ideal place to store wealth with the fiscal irresponsibility of the US' government.

The dollar is indeed a less than ideal place to store wealth, but its still the best place to store it given the problems the Euro is having, and that fact that China's currency isn't ready yet. 

&gt;Define ""threat"". Being that there's a lot of those who oppose the dollar's dominance, merely serving as an alternative is enough to be considered a threat.

A threat would be something that challenges the dollars role as the overwhelming choice for most holders of foreign currencies, which it still is right now. The Euro encompasses a market larger than the dollar's, with more people, so of course it's going to take up a good chunk of reserves.

Pourquoi si ce n'est par sentiment de cohésion / exclusion ?

&gt;ça cherche juste à le modeler autrement dans les esprits

Si ce ne sont que des mots, on utilise des mots proches pour décrire et non pour prouver. Là, tu reconnais que l'utilisation a un but autre que la neutralité de la description. On est à l'opposé d'une démarche scientifique.

L'utilisation de ""culture du viol"" par exemple, est complètement décorrélée du sens de ""culture"". C'est très loin de *on rajoute des mots pour décrire des concepts plus finement*. Il n'y a pas de finesse, il y a une idéologie derrière. D'où ma référence à Orwell.

&gt;Et ce n'est pas forcément un réflexe religieux.

Ce n'est pas ce que j'ai dit. J'ai dit :

*Il y a ensuite des rituels et des réflexes à avoir, certaines surréactions par rapport à certains événements qui donnent un caractère quasi religieux au féminisme et font que je n'apporte vraiment aucune crédibilité aux personnes qui utilisent ce genre de mots.*

Par contre, je suis d'accord avec toi sur la création de jargon dans certains groupes sociaux. Par contre, je maintiens que dans le cadre du féminisme, cette création et utilisation s'apparente plus à une volonté de cohésion / exclusion, à l'image d'un [louchébem](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louch%C3%A9bem) plutôt que d'une nécessité scientifique.

D'ailleurs, la seule chose que l'on m'a reproché dans mon intervention, c'est la critique de l'utilisation de ces mots. Pas de faits, pas d'arguments, mais la forme sans le fond. À l'image du féminisme moderne.

 First things first: This place is **rainy**. Waterproof your shoes! Nothing sucks more than sitting in a classroom for 90 minutes in wet socks. To prepare for winter get yourself a warm cap, coat (with a waterproof cowl if you can find one), scarf, gloves and thick warm socks. You might think about getting an umbrella too. Not a fan of umbrellas myself, they only get in the way and we, the natives, have gotten used to the rain. Once it starts snowing you'll want shoes with a decent sole. The snow thaws and refreezes a lot and the ground will be slippery.
Side note: The climate in the north of Germany is kinda mild but it might seem very cold to you, depending on what you are used to. Coming to think of it, get warm undershirts too.

  Don't be afraid to ask questions. Everyone below the age of 60 speaks at least a bit of English and everyone is happy to help. Don't shy away from strangers :)

While biologists sometimes use the concept of race to make distinctions among fuzzy sets of traits, others in the scientific community suggest that the idea of race often is used in a naive[4] or simplistic way,[5] because among humans, race has no taxonomic significance: all living humans belong to the same species, Homo sapiens and subspecies, Homo sapiens sapiens.[6][7]
[...]
As anthropologists and other evolutionary scientists have shifted away from the language of race to the term population to talk about genetic differences, historians, cultural anthropologists and other social scientists re-conceptualized the term ""race"" as a cultural category or social construct—a particular way that some people talk about themselves and others.""  -- [Race (human classification)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_%28human_classification%29)

Good point. J'ai bien compris qu'il s'agissait de prêcher des convertis et non d'émettre une réflexion sur les causes du comportement méprisable du mec de NRJ.

Pour la ligne éditoriale, personne n'a contesté le fait que c'est avant tout une ligne éditoriale qui glorifie le culte de la consommation, me confortant dans mon idée que le féminisme à la /r/Feminism est avant tout un individualisme consumériste. Un truc de bourgeoise qui a du temps libre. 

C'est quand même incroyable que les femmes féministes modernes soient toutes issues de la bourgeoisie. Fourest et ses études dans un collège privé catholique, Clémentine Autain et sa famille de sénateurs, et évidemment l'idole Simone de Beauvoir... À part Despentes que je respecte énormément bien sûr.

&gt;C'est comme critiquer un article publié dans une revue scientifique sous prétexte qu'il utilise un jargon trop pointu et ne vulgarise pas.

Justement je remets en cause le caractère scientifique. C'est un vocabulaire idéologique.

&gt;la contestation du vocabulaire cache souvent une négation de l'existence du phénomène.

Écoute, j'ai mis mon point de vue détaillé. **Personne ne me répond sur le fond. Personne n'a tilté quand je dénonce les liens entre féminisme et consumérisme. Personne n'a cherché à répondre à mes questions.**

Vous êtes dans la forme et l'idéologie. Vous loupez le principal parce que j'ai critiqué vos expressions favorites. Alors comme d'habitude vous allez par réflexe vous engager sur ce débat de la culture du viol que j'ai déjà eu 100 fois ici.

&gt;Pour moi la culture du viol existe, c'est un phénomène massif (une ""culture""), ça mérite un nom. Pour toi c'est une invention féministe, c'est anecdotique.

En sociologie, la culture est définie comme ""ce qui est commun à un groupe d'individus"" et comme ""ce qui le soude"".

En philosophie, le mot culture désigne ce qui est de l'ordre de l'acquis et non de l'inné.

Je ne vois toujours pas en quoi on peut parler d'une culture du viol ou de la violence en France.

Ce qui est massif c'est la critique du viol. La société est extrêmement sévère envers les violeurs. D'ailleurs les réactions **massives** de dénonciation de la vidéo montrent qu'on est dans une culture très hostile au viol.

En fait, il y a plus de gens qui parlent de culture du viol que de gens qui minimisent le viol. C'est un phénomène marginal qui devrait être qualifié de ""déni de viol"" ou de ""minimisation de viol"".

Such nonsense. Does anyone think politics in Europe are any more or less stable than politics in the US? Take the EU as a whole, or individual European countries? How many different governments have been created and destroyed just a year or two later in countries like Greece, Spain, Italy, and Portugal?

Fait passer un CV sous le nom de Daouda, et un CV sous le nom de Thierry, qu'on rigole.

Tu prends un cas, tu en oublies quatorze. Oui dans le cas de celui-ci, on peut, en l'étirant un peu, invoquer le concept de légitime défense ou de défaut de perception légitime. Mais c'est pas la majorité. La majorité, ce sont tous ces gens qui ont commis le crime de porter une casquette, d'avoir été trop basanés, et d'avoir été au mauvais endroit au mauvais moment. Rajoute parfois une pincée de haine (justifiée) de la police entraînant une révolte face aux forces de l'ordre, et tu as la recette miracle pour la majorité de tes bavures.

&gt;Je pense que ce type de racisme est directement dû à l'action d'apprentis sorciers tels que S.O.S Racisme pour ne pas les citer qui soufflent constamment depuis plus de 25 ans sur les braises du communautarisme afin de monter les français entre eux pour servir un agenda politique.

Qu'on soit d'accord : à aucun moment, le racisme de réaction n'est considéré par l'auteur comme une solution, mais simplement comme une conséquence logique. En l'occurrence, les signataires de cette tribune soutiennent que mettre les deux racismes sur le même plan est illégitime, car l'un englobe la vie de tous les jours, l'accès au travail, l'accès aux loisirs, l'éducation, l'autre, c'est une insulte dans la rue ou au train. Les deux n'ont pas le même impact.

&gt; Lors d'une étude de l'INED de 2008 16% des personnes issues de la population majoritaire disaient avoir déjà été victimes d'une agression raciste. C'est certes moins que les 25% des personnes issues de familles immigrés, ce n'est pas non plus un chiffre marginal.

[J'aime pas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySZlE4QZkyw) [les sondages](http://www.observatoire-des-sondages.org/) ;).
En l'occurrence, l'un des deux racismes peut passer au delà du regard de celui qui le subit. Quand tu es rejeté à un entretien d'embauche par ce que tu t'appelles Mohamed, tu ne peux pas dire avec certitude qu'il s'agit de racisme. Quand tu te fais traiter de sale blanc dans le train, si.

Le Venezuela a continuellement réduit son niveau de chômage et de pauvreté passant de 67% à 27% de 97 à 2011. Donc ton argument inflation = pauvreté est faux. 

Dans le cas du Venezuela l'inflation et la dévaluation font peur aux investisseurs et aux épargnants. Les pauvres ne sont pas concernés.

&gt;je ne vois pas comment des lois de préférence nationale alliée avec des mesures de dévaluation ne meneraient pas a une inflation

Parce que tu fais de l'économie sur la cuvette des chiottes. Prends un modèle et calcule les afflux de devises. 

Tu parles tout le temps de ""une inflation"". C'est quoi une inflation ?

1% d'inflation ? 3% d'inflation ? 10% d'inflation ? Structurelle ? Importée ?

&gt;La france n'est pas en récession, mais en stagnation.

La France est sortie timidement de la récession, la demande étant stable malgré une augmentation faramineuse de la dette...

Stagnation + dette, alliée à une baisse des salaires. C'est ce que propose la commission européenne pour la France.

&gt;Le tissu industriel de la France n'est PLUS fait d'industries a faible valeur ajoutée. Pour la relancer il faudrait des investissements forts et du dumping.

Le tissu industriel de la France est fait de PME/PMI. Qui paient plus d'impôts que les multinationales, de manière injuste, et qui souffrent d'une concurrence déloyale d'entreprises qui utilisent l'optimisation fiscale sans création de valeur. Les lois que proposent le FN ([tout comme l'OCDE d'ailleurs](http://www.lefigaro.fr/conjoncture/2013/07/18/20002-20130718ARTFIG00541-le-g20-s-attaque-a-l-optimisation-fiscale-des-multinationales.php)), visent à corriger cette concurrence déloyale en mettant des frontières fiscales, tout en empêchant l'évasion fiscale et en aidant les PME/PMI nationales.

Ça fait des années que le FN propose ça, l'OCDE vient de le recommander...

&gt;chercher à concurrencer justement la Chine et les pays qui peuvent se permettre d'avoir une main d'oeuvre a pas cher, alors que l'ensemble des pays développés, qui eux ont une économie qui marche, misent sur les industries a forte VA

Il n'est dit nulle part qu'il faut s'occuper des industries à faible VA. Le programme parle de [toutes les industries](http://www.frontnational.com/le-projet-de-marine-le-pen/redressement-economique-et-social/emploi-reindustrialisation-et-pmepmi/) et met l'accent sur les PME.

Il ne s'agit pas de sauver des industries désuètes comme tu le prétends, mais de compenser la concurrence déloyale et de favoriser les entreprises locales. Il n'y a pas de distinction entre industries nouvelles et vieilles. Il n'y a pas de distinction entre ""en bonne santé"" et ""en mauvaise santé"". C'est toi qui inventes.

&gt;Encore une fois pour un parti qui se veut proche du peuple la condescendance dont tu fais preuve et ton complexe de superiorité sont aussi relativement étonnant.

Les produits manufacturés dans des pays à bas coûts salariaux ont imposé à nos industriels une concurrence totalement déloyale. La sidérurgie, le textile ainsi que les industries mécaniques sont aujourd’hui sinistrées. Et les délocalisations menacent désormais gravement certains secteurs tertiaires.Le déficit du commerce extérieur traduit la très grave perte de compétitivité de notre tissu industriel (75 milliards d’euros en 2011), notre part de marché dans le commerce international ne cessant de se contracter (3,8% en 2010 contre 6% au début des années 2000). Tous les indicateurs sont au rouge.

Donc le programme c'est bien de sauver la sidérurgie le textile et les industries mécaniques ? pour redevenir compétitif contre les pays a bas couts salariaux.

&gt;E come no, certo. Forse non riesco del tutto a decifrare la vostra discussione, adesso rileggendola mi pare che questa falsa dicotomia su cui vi siete avvitati fosse partita da te

Io ho espresso la mia preferenza in quella circostanza, rispetto ad un richiamo ad una ""urgenza morale"". La tautologia è spuntata fuori quando si è voluto separare la necessità di cambiamento in seno alla società  dall'utilitarismo. 


&gt;Il valore relativo di quel bene rispetto a quel sacrificio dipende sempre, in fondo, da una decisione morale. Tu semplicemente accetti la norma morale finora dominante secondo cui la personalità degli animali non ha un grande valore intrinseco nello schema delle cose. Mi sbaglio? 

Il valore intrinseco di un bene è appunto intrinseco. La valutazione morale prescinde dal valore materiale di qualcosa: è un fattore aggiuntivo casomai. Esempio: mangiare verdura fa bene (provato in maniera indipendente) per cui l'ortaggio ha un suo valore intrinseco. Il fatto che poi, magari, quell'ortaggio provenga da piantagioni in cui non sono stati sfruttati degli immigrati ne aumenta forse il valore. Ma mentre la prima valutazione è assoluta, la seconda dipende da chi la fa.

Per la sperimentazione: io ritengo che la personalità di un ratto neanche esista. O di un moscerino della frutta. Certo che come parte di un ecosistema hanno un peso nello ""schema delle cose"" (se ho interpretato correttamente quello che intendi). Ma non stiamo parlando di sterminio dei ratti e sconvolgimento di equilibri naturali con conseguente ricaduta sull'ecosistema e quindi anche sull'uomo. Questi animali sono cresciuti in cattività per quello scopo. Ci dispiace? Si ci dispiace, perché ""moralmente"" appare ingiusto. Ha un suo valore intrinseco? Si perché contribuisce a salvare vite ed a far progredire una scienza, quella medica, che ritengo tra le più straordinarie creazioni dell'uomo. Ben vengano soluzioni alternative: ma bisogna che i loro risultati siano equiparabili agli attuali.

Last year, there were no terminals in the US that had permission for export. If I remember correctly, none of these are complete yet.

For reference, after conversion, that amounts to about 80% of Germany's annual gas usage, and about 2500% of Lithuania's gas usage, or the equivalent of 2.5% of conventional natural gas production/year.

The 'straight banana' thing did actually seem to be true, or at least, not for bananas, but for some other fruits and vegetables. See this article:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7723808.stm

&gt; The European Commission has scrapped controversial rules that prevent oddly-sized or misshapen fruit and vegetables being sold in Europe.

&gt; **The EU's agriculture commissioner called it ""a new dawn for the curvy cucumber and the knobbly carrot"".**

&gt; Marketing standards for 26 types of produce were scrapped, in a drive to cut bureaucracy.

&gt; The rules were introduced to ensure common EU standards, but are regarded by critics as examples of Euro-madness.

&gt; **Some 20% of produce is rejected by shops across the EU because it fails to meet the current requirements.**

The rules were repealed, as the article says, in 2008, and since then I've also noticed that supermarkets have started selling specific ranges of fruit and vegetables that are non-standard shapes, and with mottled surfaces, for a cut-down price. Like [this](http://dsmnative.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/142561.jpg) and [this](http://images.mysupermarket.co.uk/Products_1000/78/116978.jpg).

I don't know whether the regulations were already in place before the European rules came in, but regardless, they were silly, and having European rules prevented reforms at a national level. But credit for the EU for actually reforming it: 

&gt; The Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mariann Fischer Boel, said Wednesday's vote by the EU's fruit and vegetable management committee was ""a concrete example of our drive to cut unnecessary red tape"".

The class structure back then, composed of kings and lords, burghers and merchants, masses of peasants and powerful clergy is still recognizable today. And modernity might as well be seen as one big reaction against it.

Many still see the Roman Empire as the true beginnings of the West, with the dark ages and middle ages as something to be ignored. Something between the glorious beginning and the renaissance that isn't in need of too many attention. But the Roman Empire probably had a lot more in common with the vast Eastern agricultural realms like the Ottomans and Mughals. Empires which Western historians deemed incompatible with Western ideals. Asian despotism they called it.

Be that as it may, you're probably right in saying that the Romans will always be our prime example.

You say you are a romantic, romantics have the tendency to see reason as an insufficient source of human happiness and virtue. I think there's a truth in that. Nations need stories and shared myths to be successful. Robespierre's secular religion could also be seen as a romantic interpretation of ideas at the same time based in reason. He knew that reason alone wasn't enough to convince the people to do the right thing.

Others find the glue to make society stick together in a person; a more irrational view in my opinion, but it certainly works. For example the emperor as ultimate patriarch or Comrad Stalin as father of the nation.

I think that nations have from time to time succeeded in achieving this where the European Union fails. Take France for example, political parties there have widely diverging views, but 99% of them see themselves as part of the republic. The republic is somewhat sacred and still means something more than the hollowed out farce that has become representative democracy (I'm a bit generalizing there). That might be why voter turnout in France is more than 80%, contrasted to a meager 53% in the USA for example. For European elections the average is under 40%.

Voter turnout isn't everything of course, but I would say it's a strong indicator.

I don't know if the EU will ever achieve such a status with the people. The EU has hardly any more standing than a set of laws to smoothen business interests. If it has attracted any real feelings of the general population, it are feelings of hate, arriving from Southern Europe.

Kara Kopetsky, from the working class suburb, went missing first.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I agree with you that directly electing the head of government is not a fantastic idea, especially for the EU. However, directly electing the head of government is not a precursor to the two-party-state syndrome. For instance the British prime minister is not directly elected and Britain has one of the worst cases of two-party syndrome in the World. Strangely enough, you'll find that virtually every country which is formerly party of the British empire has this problem. This is not because they elect their presidents/prime ministers directly (they don't). It's because their voting system (First Past the Post) forces it to be that way. Whilst the US doesn't have the same system of FPTP as many former members of the British empire, it does have its own system of FPTP.

The European Union usually doesn't have a problem with this because it uses multi-member constituencies so that far more parties and views get represented per constituency. It's a very good compromise between having MPs (MEPs) who look after a specific area and stopping two-party syndrome. 

For evidence, just look at the European Parliament. It has a whole range of different parties in there of varying sizes. How many parties are there in the British Parliament? Two main ones, one medium one and a bunch of tiny ones (Greens, Scottish National Party, Pleid Cumry, ect). Additionally look at America's Congress. They have almost no independents or third partyers.  

**Tl:DR**; It's the electoral *system* not the head of government being directly elected which leads to a two party state. For evidence, at Britain which doesn't directly elected its head of government and has a bad case of two-party-state syndrome. Britain uses FPTP, just like America and most of the Commonwealth of Nations. Continental Europe and the European Parliament tend to use *better* (ie, proportional representation) systems for their elections and as a result they have a whole variety of parties in their legislatures (Parliaments, congresses) and nearly always form coalitions.

true,meidei,CYPR,Demilitarised Cyprus 2015 Special: isyan! devrim! özgürlük!,"&gt;  But I would give my life for it and the people who live here. I ould never call it stupid. Insulting your country, to me, is like spitting on the graves of your ancestors.

Breaking News: Some people might not like organisations or even countries, if those countries hate them. Not everyone suffers from Stockholm's Syndrome, and I say that's more dignified than what you propose. It's well within my rights to consider the place I live horrible and wanting to flee. I am not anyone's soldier, even if they want me to. As for whom I believe I have to fight for, that's also my call. Noone should be allowed to force me fight a war I do not believe in. They do force me right now, but that doesn't make it right. 

&gt; You know from your comment what I and probably most other people understood is that you would demilitarize all of Europe. Of course, you are entitled to your own opinion but that's not making it any less stupid. Do you really want to see us defenseless. 

Oh my. Do you believe it is truly horrible that I wish we don't need armies in the future? Saying ""I wish there are no more wars"" is such a taboo? 

&gt; Besides what I was strongly against was not that you said you wish conscription to go, but because you said demilitarization.

What I said was that ""Demilitarisation would be ideal, but I'd be willing to accept a single, professional army over the current system of some countries having conscription"". It's the part you originally replied to, from which you probably only read one or two words: 

&gt; At least, a professional pan-EU army is better than conscript army (and now, it's not like Finland's conscript army. It's both worse and more useless). Demilitarisation is even better of course. But just an ideal for the time being. 

&gt; Would you rather not be protected at all?

Other than the fact that it's the army that *caused* the war in the first place, yes, it is a widely-held belief that Cyprus should be demilitarised if the gridlock is to be resolved. With each-side saying that they base their actions on the fact that the other side is militarised, the only way to break the circle is for one of them abolish their army and take away the excuse for the other. 

Also, noone on the bloody island feels protected by the Cypriot Army. If anything, it's more dangerous for Cypriots themselves. On average they kill 10 of their own each year in accidents, let alone the property damage they cause, and the effects on the economy.

First day there and the officer told us ""We give you about 25 minutes to live in case of something happening and you are sent to fight. Your duty is important because it will give us time to send faxes around the world and ask for help"". So yeah, a conscript army of redshirts? No thank you. If we can't have an utopia, at least let's have trained people do it. Not every 17 year old on the country.

I do not *ought* to love anyone. I am a rational being and I can make my own decisions. Among them is the one *not* to actively hate other people who didn't harm me because ""I have to"". 

&gt; Also it seems to me that you do not make the difference between hating your government and hating your country.

You use ""hate"" here, and I'd rather you didn't. This is not an irrational emotion. Finding the way this country works horrible is a rational conclusion based upon the experience of many. 

The societal attitudes, and consequently the government, are shaped by few, but influential groups of people, as both of us know. 

&gt; Besides who gave you the right to settle into other people's home?

You will find that immigration is a phenomenon that goes back to the beginning of the human race, and that legal frameworks to regulate (thus *explicitly allow*) immigration exist for the last 150 years or so. Also, immigration is not about squatting other people's home, is about selling your labour to a different place than the one you were born in. If you are lucky enough, you get to select the country you emigrate to by choosing the one that respects your personality. But if you are underpriviliged already, you end up in countries that hate you as much. 

&gt; If you don't feel the Cypriot army defends you change that. Stop being such a victim. If your army doesn't treat it's soldiers like it should, change that.

Because it happened many times in the past for the extremely marginalised group of ""traitors"" to be influential in their country's politics. 

And be honest, if I was to go on a protest against the army conscription, wouldn't you send the police to arrest me?

Truth/honesty is also not necessarily welcomed when it goes the other way. There is a big ""face-saving"" aspect to German public life where being seen as ""wrong"" or making some kind of mistake is extremely embarrassing. Consequently, people will preemptively behave like assholes if they think they've fucked up. If the ""truth"" were so important, then this would not be the case.

There is also an aspect to the German love of rules that makes them only respect a certain type of behaviour if there is a rule demanding it.

This means that areas covered by ""common sense"", good manners or just common decency in Anglo-Saxon culture are not treated in the same way in Germany.

People might queue at the work canteen because there is a rule that they must do so. But out on the street, queuing for the cinema or something similar, those very same people will barge right past you.

The same can be said for friendliness at the workplace, especially in bureaucracies or even in the service industry. Unless somebody has told them to be friendly to you, they probably will not be. The concept of just being friendly of the sake of it is almost alien.

Germans often criticise Anglo-Saxon friendliness as being ""superficial"" or ""shallow"", but I find people here can have a default unfriendliness that is just as shallow, if not more so. 

This obsession with rules over a more innate societal feeling for what is ""right"" strikes me as quite creepy in more extreme cases, given Germany's history. It is also what makes Germany quite a litigious society (albeit not in the American sense). Neighbours always seem to be suing one another for minor infractions instead of talking to each other and dealing with matters at a more human level.

Finally, I'd like to say that I know this is a massive exaggeration/generalisation. There are many things I like about Germany and Germans and I live in Berlin because I find these stereotypes apply less to Berlin than to where I used to live (Southern Germany).

In surrounding countries he is a small devil, only in the Netherlands has he been replaced by a black man, a Moor to be precisely. 
This is mainly based upon the codification of the story of Sinterklaas  through the illustrated children's book Sint Nicolaas en zijn knecht (Saint Nicholas and His Servant), written in 1850 by the teacher Jan Schenkman (1806–1863). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinterklaas
This had the same effect as having de Coca Cola company rewriting the Christmas Story for advertising reasons

What is the profile of Black Pete;
•	He is a Moor
•	He is dressed in very colorful clothing (silk?) 
•	He is wearing golden jewelry 
•	He beats up naughty kids 
•	Kidnaps them back to Spain
•	Puts them to hard labor when back in Spain

Now why would you come up with a strange story like that? Well that becomes more clear when you look at the origin of the story. Jan Schenkman was a schoolteacher and made the stories up to fit his target group, the kids. But he based his stories on the existing Sinterklaas stories. You have to remember that  St. Nicolaas has already been revered since the 8th century. And that St. Nicolas is the only Catholic Saint still revered in the protestant 16th and 17th century Netherlands. 
In those days kids were not that important in society. Another group was very important at that time, being the sailors and explorers.
Besides being the patron saint of children St. Nicolas was also the patron saint of travelers and sailors. 

Now if you need a frightening side kick for your favorite patron saint you choose something that truly scares you. For 16th and 17th century sailors that would be the Barbary Coast Pirates who happen to be:
•	Moors
•	With captains wearing colorful silk clothing
•	Also wearing golden jewelry
•	Who would take you captive
•	Force you to work as a galley slave
•	And beat you mercilessly while you being a slave.
Sounds familiar?

Because of the book of Jan Schenkman this link has mainly been forgotten. Including by most Dutchman.
However, if Black Pete is a reference to slavery, it is to the enslavement of white Europeans by black Africans.

In my defence. The UK (where I come from) has quite a lot of jaywalking but far fewer child traffic deaths.

I think it is insane how people in Germany look a the lights and cross into the road without even glancing at the traffic.

Well, I don't think so.

I'd much rather use the term ""highly unlikely"". 

That's right. It depends on whether or not the allels are present in the gene pool. One of the things that was used as evidence for Viking presence in North America, was that they found tribes, where people had blue eyes, along with the fact, that genes from a Native American woman were in circulation on Iceland, and not just in a few persons, but enough for it to have happened a long time ago.

If I remember correctly, the Roma are Indo-European, which means they probably have the recessive allels in the Roma gene pool. You can find Persian people with blue eyes. It's far from common, but it's not impossible.

true,grumbal,SVAK,send € for autobahn,"**Watch out for the rise of a European Tea Party**

America’s debt-ceiling crisis achieved something quite remarkable. It made the EU look well governed by comparison. Both the EU and the US systems are weighed down with checks and balances that make it hard to get things done. But Europe currently has one thing going for it that America lacks. All the most important decision makers in Brussels are committed to making the system work. There are no Tea Party types who regard compromise as a betrayal.

This broad centrist consensus was an unacknowledged strength of the EU throughout the euro crisis. Although it became routine to complain that European leaders always do “too little, too late”, the markets also realised that – even if Europe’s leaders did not get it right first time – they would just reconvene, at yet another emergency meeting, and keep bashing away at the problem. The fact that all 28 national leaders at EU summits are committed to working together is crucial in keeping the euro alive.

In the coming year, however, the big danger to the European single currency is that the political consensus that underpins the euro could come unstuck. A weak economy, weariness with austerity, anger about immigration and resentment of a remote-seeming EU are fuelling the ascent of anti-establishment and nationalist political parties across the continent.

These rising political forces are gaining ground in big EU countries such as France, the Netherlands, Britain and Italy – and also in smaller nations such as Greece, Hungary, Finland and Austria. Given that the EU requires unanimity for many big decisions, even a small state that goes rogue could cause real trouble.

As the Tea Party has demonstrated in the US, anti-establishment radicals do not need to capture the position of president or prime minister to gum up the system. Even if traditional pro-EU centrists continue to lead most national governments in Europe, their room for manoeuvre at EU summits is greatly reduced if populist parties are making big gains back home. A Dutch prime minister who fears the anti-EU Freedom party – which is topping the opinion polls at present in the Netherlands – will find it much harder to agree to a new bailout for southern Europe. Similarly, a British leader who is losing ground to the UK Independence party will be driven to take more extreme positions in EU negotiations.

Next year’s elections to the European parliament also look like a possible breakthrough moment for a European Tea Party. The parliament has traditionally been the most federalist institution in Europe, acting as a lobby group for the transfer of more powers to Brussels. But next May’s elections are likely to show a surge in votes for eurosceptic parties across the continent. It is quite feasible that the National Front will top the polls in France, that the Freedom party will win in the Netherlands and that Ukip will be the biggest single bloc from Britain.

What is more, the European parliament has recently gained new powers. While it lacks the blocking capacity of the US Congress, a rebellious European legislature could reject the EU budget, prevent crucial appointments and refuse to sign off on legislation that is needed to prop up the euro.

Europe’s rebel parties are very far from forming a coherent bloc. They range from proto-fascists such as Hungary’s Jobbik to the far-left Syriza in Greece – and from conservative nationalists such as Poland’s Law and Justice party to semi-anarchists such as the Five Star Movement in Italy. Some of the anti-establishment parties, such as France’s National Front, are trying to make the journey from the far right towards political respectability. A few, such as Ukip and parts of the Italian right, share the tax-cutting, small-government agenda of the Tea Party. Other rebel parties in Europe, including the Dutch Freedom party, have cast themselves as defenders of the traditional welfare state.

What almost all Europe’s anti-establishment parties share with the Tea Party, however, is an anti-elitist rhetoric that casts mainstream politicians as the servants of a remote, globalised elite. Another central theme that unites most of Europe’s anti-establishment parties with the Tea Party is resentment of immigration. When mainstream politicians say – correctly – that their ability to curb immigration is constrained by EU rules on free movement of people, they merely fuel populist rage at “out of touch” elites.

Opinion polls in the richer countries of western Europe show an increasing voter concern about migration – legal and illegal – that is rich fodder for Europe’s Tea Party types. Anger about the economy and about immigration are fusing – and can then be easily directed at the EU itself, which has large powers in both areas. As one British official puts it: “Ukip’s dream is to get Europe, immigration and welfare into the same sentence.”

Beyond particular issues, what Europe’s rebel parties really share with the Tea Party in America is a political style – a rhetoric that holds that the system is rotten, that society is heading for disaster and that therefore compromise is a betrayal. Even in the US – which has built up global confidence in the dollar over centuries – the Tea Party’s political machinations came close to causing a financial panic. For the EU, which is still struggling to rebuild confidence in the euro, the rise of a European Tea Party would risk disaster.",0,1382487968,null,0,false,0,ccxi3im,t3_1ozvxu,t1_ccxi3im,t3_1ozvxu,null,1429020518,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

From what I understand, it is mostly an export problem. Shipping LNG via ship to Europe is more expensive than purchasing it via pipeline from Russia. So US -&gt; Europe routes may not be developed or competitive until Russia manufactures a crisis again. At that point, there might not be the capacity to meet demand. 

There is lots of gas in the US and Canada, its getting it to consumers elsewhere that is the problem. [One of the things I've read](http://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/u-s-gas-exports-would-be-a-global-boon-foreign-energy-leaders-say-20131010), but there is tons of information out there.

This could also cause problems should Russia manufacture another crisis. Japan and SK are very aggressively trying to secure North American energy supplies. So there might not be enough supply left to moderate a Russian crisis should Europe decide to continue its single supplier policy.

I know a *ton* of Polish immigrants or first generation Poles that are essentially American. Because of where I grew up, most of my friends are immigrants, mostly from Eastern Europe. Their parents will tell you they're American but they retain their very defined accents. My friends/their kids (also immigrants but at a young age) are Americans for all intents and purposes. Even if they retain many of their customs you would not be able to discern who was natural born and who was an immigrant if you were talking to me and them. 

Immigrants do tend to congregate together when they first move to the US, but they dissipate relatively quickly. All my friends lived in the same neighborhood in Chicago when they moved to the US, because it was the default location for Eastern European immigrants. Now they have dissipated all over the place, mostly to the suburbs. So when you were here you likely saw the neighborhoods filled with recent immigrants.

&gt; And its all undone when the child comes across an actual gypsy, because 100 times out of 100 he will get robbed.

You're not being racist. All you're saying that is if a gypsy sees a kid, there's a 100% chance he/she'll kidnap the child.

&gt; The change has to come from within just like it happened with the US roma community, they might be roma but completely dropped the gypsy lifestyle.

I'm sorry, but those are empty words, if pretty. American Roma didn't just go to themselves: ""ALRIGHT, NO MORE KIDNAPPING"" as a collective. Obviously, there's something about American culture that allows Roma to integrate more effectively.

&gt; It has nothing to do with race because people are singling out their lifestyle, not their race.

Eh, I don't buy that. These things always become amalgams. It's like the whole anti-antisemitism thing in Europe where it would be vague if Jews were a religion or a race.
