Sorry, I should have made the premise clear from the beginning. I wasn't talking about present day members or the current situation. If the EP truly ran things in the EU, I believe it would quickly change. 

I'm afraid we would quickly see the blocks working more as political parties and sway under public pressure. It's difficult enough creating policies for such a wide range of countries as it is. Can you imagine them increasing taxes or reducing public services if their MEP seats are on the line? 

That's probably the only good thing about China's situation, they can and do make though policy choices regardless of public opinion. If they complete their transition they can always relinquish some power.

As an Englishman you're already supposed to have a more direct relationship with your MP. How does that work in practice? Don't they get punished if their constituents suffer under gov't policy?

There's a whole lot of rappers that you could consider being ""du rap de fils d'immigré"". It's a lot of conscious rap with a fuckton of violence. The two most known tracks being Le cuir usé d'une valise and Créature Ratée.

By the way, for those who are not familiar with french rap, Serge Teyssot Gay (Ex Noir Désir's guitar player) created a band with another guitarist and a drummer (called ""Zone Libre"") and made two albums with each time two rappers : first, Casey and Hamé (from La Rumeur), second, Casey and B.James.

Yes. 


&gt; As far as I could tell certifications and degrees from outside Germany are met with an air of suspicion.

Depends on what kind of degree and where you are applying. Since only Germany and some of it's neighbours use a dual system of TVET and responding degrees, most foreign degrees cannot directly be compared to German degrees. 

However, since 01.04.2012 foreigners have a legitimate claim to get their degree checked and recognized, if it is comparable. 


Larger companies are usually used to foreign degrees, smaller companies are not. 57% of all jobs are in smaller companies, construction workers and chef are usually not trained at universities but in companies and TVET schools.

&gt;1. Die AfD hetzt gegen Südländer.

&gt; Zeige mir bitte jemand eine Quelle die das beweist. Ich denke da kochen einige Emotionen höher als sie müssten.

Es ist ja nicht so als wäre das irgendwie ein Thema welches unter der Hand geht: 

&gt;Es wurde nachgefragt.

&gt;„Glauben Sie, dass die Arbeitsmoral in Südeuropa schlechter ist?“

&gt;Lucke bekräftigte.

&gt;„Ja, ganz klar. Aber lassen wir die Menschen doch so leben, wie es sie glücklich macht. Wenn die Menschen in diesen Ländern weniger und entspannter arbeiten wollen und dafür weniger Wohlstand in Kauf nehmen, bitte schön....

Quelle: http://afdwatch.de/2013/05/rechte-spinner-und-99-tadellose-burger/

Dass die Aussage natürlich kompletter Schwachsinn ist und ausschliesslich aus neokonservativer Propaganda besteht, ist natürlich ein anderes Thema.

http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=ANHRS

&gt;Griechen haben pro Arbeiter ca. 2100 Jahres-Arbeitsstunden geleistet entspricht 40-h-Woche über 52 Wochen hinweg (im Durchschnitt)
&gt;
&gt;Deutsche leisten seit 10 Jahren pro Arbeiter nur ca. 1450 Jahres-Arbeitsstunden (mit stetig abnehmender Tendenz: im Jahr 2000 waren es noch ca. 1470, 2010 waren nur noch ca. 1420, also 50h weniger bzw. 3%) entspricht ca. 27-h-Woche über 52 Wochen hinweg.

Komisch, dass diese erlogene Propagandascheisse jedes mal wiede rhervorgekramt wird wenn es um die AfD geht. Die Massenmedien trauen sich inzwischen nicht mehr damit um sich zu werfen. Auf dem niedrigen Stammtischniveau auf dem die AfD fischt, ist das jedoch anscheinend noch immer in. 


&gt;2. Die AfD kritisiert die Schuldengemeinschaft.
&gt;
&gt;Absolut korrekt. Wenn ich meinen Haushalt nicht im Griff habe klopfe ich nicht an deine Tür und verlange dass du meine Schulden übernimmst. Das gilt im Kleinen wie im Großen. Das ist keine Frage der Solidarität, das ist eine Frage des Selbstschutzes, der Leistungsgerechtigkeit und damit Fairness.

Ist das geil...arbeitest du bei denen oder wie? :D

Wo war den die FAIRNESS als wir die Lohnstückkosten soweit gesenkt haben, dass unsere Nachbarländer ihre Industrieproduktion ins Billigland Deutschland verloren haben damit wir EXPORTWELTMEISTEr sein können? Jetzt alles horten...is klar Fairness...


&gt;    3. Das wahre Problem ist die Forderung nach Austerität.
&gt;
&gt;Dieser Irrglaube ist ein großes Problem. Staat auf Kredit ist eine der unsozialsten Praktiken die je angewandt wurden. Stellt euch vor ihr kauft euch ein neues Auto und stellt die Rechnung auf euer dreijähriges Kind aus.

Der Irrglaube einiger Wannabe-Wirtschaftsspezis wie dir ist, dass sie denken sie könnten BWL auf VWL anweden. Sie scheitern so derbe, dass es schon nicht mehr witzig ist. Dein Vergleich zeugt nicht nur von deiner Unkenntnis sondern auch von der der Anhänger dieser Dummschwätzer. Das witzige dabei ist, dass selbst diese Parteipuppen bei der AfD das in Wirklichkeit verstehen und auch über euch lachen ;)


&gt;    4. Die AfD ist nationalistisch
&gt;
&gt;Polemisch und nicht richtig, die AfD will eine starke EU. Für eine starke EU braucht es starke Einzelstaaten. Sie versteht, dass ein zentralistisches Staatswesen nicht funktionieren kann, es noch nie hat und nie tun wird. 

Aha. Sie will kein grosses ""Land"" EU sondern viele kleine Länder wie Deutschland. Weil zentralistisches Staatsewesen nicht funktionieren kann...aber wie funktioniert das dann in Deutschland? Siehst du überhaupt den Widerspruch oder bist du schon so vollgestopft mit Werbung, dass nichts mehr passt? Merkst du überhaupt, dass du hier einfach nur den Zoom veränderst aber an der Regierungslogik sich nichts ändert? 

Faszinierend. 


&gt;    5. Die AfD will die Südstaaten rausschmeißen
&gt;
&gt;Nicht richtig, für mehr Details empfehle ich die zahlreichen Interviews mit Vertretern der AfD. Zusammenfassend möchte die AfD einen temporären Austritt von Staaten erlauben, damit diese so schnell wie möglich genesen. 

Genesen sollen sie nachdem sie ""temporär"" ausgetreten sind? Wie stellst du dir das vor? Wie sollen den die Griechen ihre EURO-Schulden in Neo-Drachme abbezahlen? Ever? 

Ich verstehe ja, dass diese Wirtschafts""wissenschaftler"" sich diese Thesen ausdenken um ein paar Dumme BILD-Leser abzugreifen. Warum aber sich jemand als Intellektueller hinstellst und den Schwachsinn auch noch vertritt ohne auch nur den ersten Schritt der möglichen Konsequenzen zu bedenken, ist mir schleierhaft.

Also warum tust du es? War es dir schon vorher klar, dass du damit auf die Schnauze fallen wirst und hast du deshalb einen frischen Account aufgemacht?

Ist ja jetzt wirklich nicht der erste Beitrag hier der die AfD zersetzt. 

Mach dir nix vor, du bist hier nicht bei PI-News oder im Kommentarbereich einer Zeitung. Ich nehme mir gerne Zeit um jeden einzelen Programmpunkt dieser Patei zu fressen wenn es sein muss.

Wiki quote: ""Sonderzug nach Pankow (Special Train to Pankow) is the title of the song of the German rock singer Udo Lindenberg released as a single on 2 February 1983.
Its origin is a reaction to the refusal of his wish for a concert in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) by the GDR-administration in charge. The text of this approximately three minutes long song appeals ironically directly to the former president of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic Erich Honecker. The melody is based on the swing classic Chattanooga Choo Choo by Glenn Miller from the year 1941; the text is loosely based on the lyrics for Zug nach Kötzschenbroda by Bully Buhlan from 1946, which uses the same melody. With regard to the Berlin borough Pankow, the title is based on the fact that Schloss Schönhausen situated there was the seat of the president from 1949 until 1960 and was later seat of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic until 1964. After that many members of the GDR government and high employees of the other administration departments of the government lived in Pankow, for example in the Majakowskiring.
This song was in the western German music charts from 19 March 1983 to 6 May 1983 for seven weeks, spending four weeks at number 5. The reaction to the song led to the first and only concert of Udo Lindenberg in the GDR on 25 October 1983. This concert took place during the festival ""Rock für den Frieden"" (Rock for Peace) in Berlin's Palast der Republik, but Udo Lindenberg did not sing this song then. A planned tour through the GDR in the following tour was cancelled. The song Sonderzug nach Pankow became a cult song in the GDR and is one of Udo Lindenberg's most famous songs.""",0,1369128129,null,0,false,0,ca2xk6k,t3_1eoxft,t1_ca2xk6k,t3_1eoxft,null,1431086243,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

De mon point de vue la tendance à la ghettoïsation est naturelle. A mesure qu'une société permet aux individus de s'affirmer en tant qu'individus, ceux-ci privilégient l'entre-soi.

C'est quelque chose qui a toujours existé, et c'est pour ça que dans les villes européennes il y a toujours des quartiers bourgeois, des quartiers juifs, et qu'on retrouve des rues des tanneurs, rue des bouchers... même la mixité sociale des immeubles haussmaniens n'est qu'un fantasme: il y avait certes de la mixité sociale dans les immeubles parisiens mais hors de question qu'un banquier partage sa cour d'immeuble avec un menuisier, d'où un regroupement par bloc.

Le même phénomène existe aussi dans les villes américaines où c'est encore plus flagrant: dans des villes sans frontières les habitants choisissent leur lieu d'habitation en fonction du quartier et des voisins; Sans parler du concept de *gated communities*

Du coup j'ai beaucoup, beaucoup de mal avec la pensée constructiviste / socialiste moderne qui conditionne le *vivre ensemble* à la mixité sociale.

En plus ceux qui dénoncent la gentrification sont d'horribles passéistes: une ville c'est sensé être quelque chose de vivant, qui évolue, qui se détruit et se reconstruit. Les populations se déplacent, les quartiers changent et c'est finalement quand le pouvoir public tente de freiner les évolutions que ça fait mal. Paris en est un magnifique exemple: alors que la demande est élevée la ville s'acharne à faire du social dans des quartiers recherchés, au final c'est la classe moyenne qui se retrouve chassée des quartiers populaires.

&gt; Ça doit passer par un contrôle du foncier ( et donc des loyers), l'implantation de logements sociaux et des infrastructure de service adéquate, bref il faut surveiller que la puissance public ne vendent pas le gâteau à des promoteurs affamés, mais qu'elle contrôle et planifie cette mutation urbaine.

De mon point de vue toujours, la mutation de la ville est incontôlable et difficilement planifiable. Qui dit centre-ville protégé dit rejet des habitants en périphérie, explosion de la banlieue et apparition de la banlieue moche.

Là où le public devrait intervenir par contre, c'est dans un rôle de facilitateur: rendre disponible le foncier, permettre l'accroissement de la densité (et donc les rénovations/reconversions) et en fixant des règles pour l'espace public pour éviter la création d'enclaves fermées (résidences sécurisées, centres commerciaux urbains ou en périphérie)...",0,1369129999,null,0,false,0,ca2xrj3,t3_1empuo,t1_ca2xrj3,t1_ca2a3b7,null,1431086146,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

true,theCroc,SWED,Sweden,"Well we all do that to some extent. Though most of us realize that Scandinavia is basically identical with small local variations. In Sweden things like ""jantelagen"" and ""typiskt svenskt"" are used as derogatory remarks to dismiss the opponents argument rather than to proclaim some kind of national superiority. 

The only people I ever hear talk about Jantelagen are people being called out on being assholes. Most commonly some neo-rich person that to his horror discovers that he too has to pay taxes and fair wages to his employees etc. Instead of realizing that he has gained much from living in Sweden and it is now time to give something back he will go on a spiel about ""jantelagen"" and how everyone is envious of his success etc. before moving to London or some tax haven and then promptly loose all his new money etc.

I think a part of it is also older brother/younger brother syndrome. Sweden sees itself (and is seen) as the older brother due to our size and industrial base economy. Denmark is seen (from our perspective) as fairly equal but basically similar so not very interresting. We used to have a lot of fights in the past but now we're cool and we don't get too involved in each others lives. Except that we hit you up for booze all the time. Norway is definitely the younger brother in the comparison, always under the control of either brother and always torn between them. Finaly he is standing up for himself and is doign his own thing. Both older brothers are a bit envious of his stroke of luck in finding oil and getting suddenly disgustingly rich. But we still have a hard time seeing him as anything other than the little brother we used to pick on all the time. 

Either way this dynamic makes us feel like we know each other while we really don't. Denmark and Norway ends up paying a lot more attention to Sweden than vice versa. Sweden is kind of self sufficient and happy in it's own little bubble. We tell ourselves we are well traveled and knowledgeable but in reality that just means we go to Thailand on vacation a few times. In the end I think every country struggles with this to some extent. Some more than others.

I don't know what my point is really other than to partially agree with you with the reservation that I hear the same kind of rethoric from norwegians, danes, germans and dutch so in the end we are all a bit ignorant of our similarities and like to uphold general virtues as typical for our own group.",0,1369130209,null,0,1369131645,0,ca2xsd6,t3_1epn37,t1_ca2xsd6,t1_ca2xa74,null,1431086136,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Of course your environment has an influence in your choices and your behavior and I am certainly not claiming that an AIDS ridden child from Africa should just man the fuck up if it wants to be the next CEO of Goldman &amp; Sachs. And that is not the point here. The point is that these people come from their shit home countries because they seek a better life, get provided with this better life for free. Get everything they want, get all the possibilities, especially in a country like Sweden and do nothing in return. Even worse, they still behave like they fucking rule the country and if it aren't the parents, it are the children and their children's children. 

I know you people are fast with the racism claims. Because it's easy, it avoids difficult discussions, but let me tell you. I am not. More precisely, I am a descendant of immigrants. My grandfathers family came here from Italy with the first great wave of Gastarbeiter in the 60's. And yes, they were poor, they lived in a ""Ghetto"" and society looked down on them. My grandfather worked half his life in the coal mines. Do you know what that means? Coal mines? It means one hell of a workplace, one of the worst you can work on in western countries, but he still had respect for this country and it's people. He still stuck to it's culture and his roots but he always told my mother to respect the magnificent country she is allowed to live in and to give it something back, what she did. Nowadays she considers herself German, not Italian and she did always worked hard in her life.

Now what I want to say is, that it is not racist to call for consequences - at least not more racist than telling some people couldn't help it, just because they are immigrants - of unacceptable behavior. These people had their chance, for far more than only a few years and they blew it. We hardly can deport them now, especially of your country is acting after Ius Soli but we can close our borders. We can only let people in, which our countries receive benefits from rather than suffering.

1. Ireland was a predominantly rural country.

3. Large amounts of land owned by the Anglo-Irish or British. 

Farmers in Ireland tended to divide their land up between their sons in their wills, unlike the customary primogeniture (first son gets it all) in Britain.  This was due to less industry in Ireland whereby if you excluded one son, you couldn't guarantee that they would be able to go to a city and find a job.  

Over time, the farms became smaller and smaller as they were subdivided, until the only crop that a family could survive on was the potato.  Larger farms, usually not owned by the Catholic Irish, were used more efficiently to grow other crops.

&gt; I think a part of it is also older brother/younger brother syndrome. Sweden sees itself (and is seen) as the older brother due to our size and industrial base economy.

No, Danish people don't actually see Sweden as the ""older brother"" — that's one of very few exclusively Swedish things. ;-)

In fact most Danish people will moan at you for making that reference, because it's almost always a case of Swedish people trying to be smug to Danish people for whatever reason. It's actually a bit offensive when you think about it — the number of times I've had to overhear Swedes go on about how racist I probably am because I'm Danish is just… mind-boggling. Swedish public discourse is extremely eager to stereotype Denmark as the inappropriate ""little brother"" who doesn't know how to behave, and of course it goes the other way too, but one has a sense of self-superiority, another doesn't.

One is *always* on the spot shouting ""WELL IN *SWEDEN* WE DO THIS AND THAT AND IT'S MUCH BETTER"", while another is just calmly pointing it out… :)

&gt; Either way this dynamic makes us feel like we know each other while we really don't. Denmark and Norway ends up paying a lot more attention to Sweden than vice versa. Sweden is kind of self sufficient and happy in it's own little bubble. We tell ourselves we are well traveled and knowledgeable but in reality that just means we go to Thailand on vacation a few times. In the end I think every country struggles with this to some extent. Some more than others.

So true. Although I can't proclaim that Danes are necessarily super knowledgable about Sweden, but at least there isn't widespread disdain. :)

Warum müssen die Hersteller immer so radikal auf den Preis drücken statt Kunden durch attraktive Preise zu binden. Hier ist mal ein Preismodell für die Adobe Pallette mit realistischen Optionen

Wenn eine Firma die Lizensen anmietet wird ein individueller preis pro Mitarbeiter erstellt. 10-15€ im Monat pro person und produkt sind absolut realistisch. Der Webdesigner mit Photoshop und den Web developer Tools zahlt 50-60€ Im Monat und bekommt automatisch die Updates. Der Grafiker zahlt das selbe für Photoshop Indesign und Illustrator. und vllt nen gesammtpreis von 100€ pro monat pro mitarbeiter für die gesammte Mastersuite. Das ist zwar weniger als die Unternehmen jetzt zahlen aber unternehmen updaten nicht jedes Jahr.

Privatpersonen können sich die Programme wie bei Steam Individuell anmieten. Jahrespreis von 120€ für 3 beliebige Programme und Tages, Wochen und Monatsmieten im 1-10€ Bereich. Dazu auf der selben Plattform Gratis tools wie Photoshop express und den Cloudservice á la dropbox. Dann ist das ganze fast wie ein gutes Free2Play spiel und nicht so offensichtlich darauf ausgemacht den Kunden auszunehmen.

Während ich das hier schreibe Realisiere ich das ich für das Modell das ich beschrieben habe bereit wäre das Piraten aufzugeben und mir die programme wenn ich sie dann mal brauche für einen Tag oder Monat anzumieten. Wenn es dann noch die gelegentlichen Gratis Credits oder ähliches gibt würde ich nie wieder zu gecrackten versionen zurück wollen.

The age of multiculturalism in Europe is slowly coming to an end, the fact is people generally tolerate other cultures, enjoy exploring certain aspects of them, but do not support a culture actively destroying their own culture. 
Culture is the binding of a society, so multiculturalism is in a basic sense a divided society. Ethnicism is not in any way the same a culture, I personally know many Indians, Iranians and Nigerians from my experience working in Law and hospitals, as such they are fully integrated into our culture and respect it, the same cannot be said for individuals such as in this video or the many ""ghetto"" like communities through Europe where they don't even speak the language of their new country.",0,1369137610,null,0,1369137802,0,ca2yryr,t3_1eqp0d,t1_ca2yryr,t3_1eqp0d,null,1431085670,27,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,27

The other issue is what that rate would be. If its too low then richer countries lose tons of income as they are forced to drop their taxes.

It would still mean that the hypothetical Romanian company would have to pay Vodafone for access to their network at whatever price Vodafone sets, based on the cost of doing business in the UK, not in Romania. The really big expenses like network equipment, engineers, backhaul links and so on won't change because of this, since this is up to Vodafone to provide, not the company buying access to their network.

This happens without the EU's new plans, anyway. I'm sure it's the same in the Netherlands but we already have lots of virtual networks that run on top of the established players. None of them are particularly large though, most people are with one of the big companies. They have their niche (like cheap international calls, they're popular with immigrants who want to call back home) but they're not going to cause anyone to lose lots of customers any time soon.

If the Romanian company really wanted to compete with Vodafone on an entirely fair level, they'd have to build their own network and use whatever cost benefits they can get from being Romanian to do it cheap enough to lower prices. But they can't, because they won't have any radio spectrum to build a network to make use of.

So hi middle class, please give monies.

The lower class sees their neighbourhoods swamped with new people that do not share their culture, language and (if applicable) religion.

&gt; „The Way“ ist ein weiteres Werk von Stefan Brandenburg und nimmt einen mit auf seine Reise ins Land von Techhouse und Minimaler Clubmusik. Man hört gleich, dass der eingeschlagene Weg für diese Reise auf jeden Fall der richtige ist. In der letzten Zeit gab Stefan Gas und arbeitete regelmäßig so oft er nur konnte an seinen neuen Werken. Dieses Album beinhaltet davon 13 aussagekräftige Tracks wobei überwiegend Techhouse, sowie Minimaler tanzbarer Clubsound heraussticht. Vor allem kreative Einfälle und nicht zu verspielte Melodien hinterlassen einen klaren unverkennbaren Eindruck. Jeder Track hat durch gut platzierte Effekte und optimalen Einsatz von Vocals, unterstützt von knackigen Kicks und groovigen Percussions eine sehr starke mit unter auch emotionale Ausdruckskraft. Egal welche Farbe der Faden hat, Faden bleibt Faden und in dem Fall, hat sich Stefan entschieden einen schwarzen Faden durch das Album zu ziehen und beginnt auch gleich mit dem Track „Schwarzer Faden“. Trotz der Vielseitigkeit an Ideen bleibt ein einzigartiger moderner Stil enthalten, der sicherlich bei vielen Leuten gefallen finden wird! „The Way“ ist Stefan`s Weg, um auszudrücken das einen alle Türen offen stehen, solange man selber an das was man macht glaubt. Hört man „True To Myself“ oder „Like Yesteday“, kann man die Gefühle die dabei übermittelt werden förmlich hören und sich trotzdem auf der Tanzfläche von treibenden Rhythmen animieren lassen danach zu tanzen.

&gt; ""The Way"" is another piece of Stefan Brandenburg's work, it takes you on a journey to the land of Techhouse and minimalistic club music. Upon listening, you realize instantly that the route this journey is taking you onto is definitely the right one. Stefan has been working on his new tracks as much as he could lately to produce and refine them. This album contains 13 significant tracks where Techhouse and minimal club-sounds to dance to stick out. Not too playful melodies and most of all creative ideas leave an unmistakable impression. Every piece on this album has amongst others a strong emotional expression with well placed effects and best use of vocals, supported by dense kicks and groovy percussions. [Faden-Satz]. In defiance of the variety of ideas, this album still maintains a unique and modern style which is welcomed by its listeners. ""The Way"" is Stefan's way to express that all doors are open to you as long as you believe in what you do. Tracks like ""True to Myself"" or ""Like Yesterday"" transmit feelings in a way that you might think you can almost hear them, all that while they are still encouraging to dance to the drifty rhythms.",0,1369142980,null,0,1369143246,0,ca2zvbq,t3_1erg60,t1_ca2zvbq,t3_1erg60,null,1431085154,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

OF COURSE if you study international relation, european studies, political science, you can only find stuff abroad.

And of course, if you study engineering, law or economics, you are perfectly ok working in Italy, paid like a dream.

Then I came to know that my German, British, Dutch, French, Finnish friends who studied political science or international relations had great opportunities to find work at home too, in NGOs, Government, Offices of various organizations, etc.

I also discovered that my friends with a degree in engineering are now forced to work 2 jobs to earn 1000 euros a month. Those who studied economics cannot find any job. Those who studied law are stuck doing unpaid practices, slaving away until fired, to find then only another unpaid internship in a law firm.

My friends who studied IT have the worse: the are seriously necessary, and yet they are underpaid and then fired, for short project-jobs. Why?Ah well, we've got the keep the old guys in,  those who were last trained in 1995, can't send an email and barely speak their own language, or those who HAVE to ke keep the job for shady reasons.

It's not what you study or where you go. It's not even the poor matching between supply and offer of work anymore. The market is simply not creating those jobs or is giving them to people who never trained for it. I have a huge list of aquaintances who got jobs for family or good looks, jobs they had not even the remote clue about.

Willst du mich veralbern? Wettbewerb ist jetzt also unfair, Halleluja.

Dein Vergleich zeugt nicht nur von deiner Unkenntnis sondern auch von der der Anhänger dieser Dummschwätzer. Das witzige dabei ist, dass selbst diese Parteipuppen bei der AfD das in Wirklichkeit verstehen und auch über euch lachen ;)

Ah, du willst mich nicht veralbern, sondern beleidigen. Argumentum ad hominem oder wie war das? Mal sehen was dein restlicher Kommentar noch bereithält. 

&gt;Aha. Sie will kein grosses ""Land"" EU sondern viele kleine Länder wie Deutschland. Weil zentralistisches Staatsewesen nicht funktionieren kann...aber wie funktioniert das dann in Deutschland? Siehst du überhaupt den Widerspruch oder bist du schon so vollgestopft mit Werbung, dass nichts mehr passt? Merkst du überhaupt, dass du hier einfach nur den Zoom veränderst aber an der Regierungslogik sich nichts ändert?

Es funktioniert in Deutschland schlecht, wobei es weniger schlecht funktioniert als bei einer noch größeren Zentralisierung. Glücklicherweise bewahrt sich Deutschland einen gewissen Föderalismus.

&gt;Genesen sollen sie nachdem sie ""temporär"" ausgetreten sind? Wie stellst du dir das vor? Wie sollen den die Griechen ihre EURO-Schulden in Neo-Drachme abbezahlen? Ever?

So wie andere Länder vor ihnen auch (junges Beispiel: Argentinien). Schuldenschnitt, Abwertung, Reformierung.

&gt;Ich verstehe ja, dass diese Wirtschafts""wissenschaftler"" sich diese Thesen ausdenken um ein paar Dumme BILD-Leser abzugreifen. Warum aber sich jemand als Intellektueller hinstellst und den Schwachsinn auch noch vertritt ohne auch nur den ersten Schritt der möglichen Konsequenzen zu bedenken, ist mir schleierhaft.

Ad hominem. Ließt du die Bild? Ich nicht.

&gt;Also warum tust du es? War es dir schon vorher klar, dass du damit auf die Schnauze fallen wirst und hast du deshalb einen frischen Account aufgemacht?

Oh Gott PI, ließt du den Scheiß?

&gt; „The Way“ ist ein weiteres Werk von Stefan Brandenburg und nimmt einen mit auf seine Reise ins Land von Techhouse und Minimaler Clubmusik. Man hört gleich, dass der eingeschlagene Weg für diese Reise auf jeden Fall der richtige ist. In der letzten Zeit gab Stefan Gas und arbeitete regelmäßig so oft er nur konnte an seinen neuen Werken. Dieses Album beinhaltet davon 13 aussagekräftige Tracks wobei überwiegend Techhouse, sowie Minimaler tanzbarer Clubsound heraussticht. Vor allem kreative Einfälle und nicht zu verspielte Melodien hinterlassen einen klaren unverkennbaren Eindruck. Jeder Track hat durch gut platzierte Effekte und optimalen Einsatz von Vocals, unterstützt von knackigen Kicks und groovigen Percussions eine sehr starke mit unter auch emotionale Ausdruckskraft. Egal welche Farbe der Faden hat, Faden bleibt Faden und in dem Fall, hat sich Stefan entschieden einen schwarzen Faden durch das Album zu ziehen und beginnt auch gleich mit dem Track „Schwarzer Faden“. Trotz der Vielseitigkeit an Ideen bleibt ein einzigartiger moderner Stil enthalten, der sicherlich bei vielen Leuten gefallen finden wird! „The Way“ ist Stefan`s Weg, um auszudrücken das einen alle Türen offen stehen, solange man selber an das was man macht glaubt. Hört man „True To Myself“ oder „Like Yesteday“, kann man die Gefühle die dabei übermittelt werden förmlich hören und sich trotzdem auf der Tanzfläche von treibenden Rhythmen animieren lassen danach zu tanzen.

Upon listening, you realize instantly that the route this journey is taking you onto is definitely the right one. Stefan has been working on his new tracks as much as he could lately to produce and refine them. This album contains 13 significant tracks where Techhouse and minimal club-sounds to dance to stick out. Not too playful melodies and most of all creative ideas leave an unmistakable impression. Every piece on this album has amongst others a strong emotional expression with well placed effects and best use of vocals, supported by dense kicks and groovy percussions. [Faden-Satz]. In defiance of the variety of ideas, this album still maintains a unique and modern style which is welcomed by its listeners. ""The Way"" is Stefan's way to express that all doors are open to you as long as you believe in what you do.

It's floating at the top and it puts people off. I find it wholly unpleasant to be in a thread with such people who take ideas about eugenics seriously. I know there are a lot of people who're put off from visiting /r/Europe because of a lot of the racist stuff and it could be much worse.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Warum auch in einer Diskussion Umgangsformen wahren wenn man polemisch sein kann? Ich denke du bist einfach ein Troll, zwar überzeugt von dem was du schreibst, aber Stil und Inhalt sind eins. Du hast schon diese Antwort nicht mehr verdient, erwarte keine weitere.

&gt;Wettbewerb nennt sich das? Was gutes ist es auch? Warum schreibt dann die AfD nicht in ihr Programm rein: ""Leute wir geben euch noch weniger Gehalt. Dafür gehts Deutschland besser!""? Wir reden hier von einer klassischen NeoCon Masche gepushed durch Subventionen, Steuererleichterungen u.ä.. Alles zu Lasten der Arbeitnehmer. Das ist das was der ""Wissenschaftliche Beirat"" der AfD predigt. Warum hört man das den nicht von denen? Was denkst du den?

Ich fasse zusammen: Wettbewerb ist böse. Immerhin  kritisiert du Subvention, Subventionen sind per se Wettbewerbsverzerrung auf Kosten aller, auch Arbeitgeber. Ich schreibe aller, da letztlich auch die verlieren, die von einzelnen Subventionen profitieren. 

Aber kommen wir zurück zum bösen Wettbewerb: Es ist die Entscheidung der einzelnen Personen wo sie arbeiten und für welches Gehalt. Dadurch das einzelne Unternehmen und politische Systeme im freien, kooperativen Wettbewerb stehen haben am Ende alle, auch Arbeitnehmer, mehr Wohlstand. Wettbewerb ist es zu verdanken, dass Smartphones mittlerweile für 100,-€ jedem zur Verfügung stehen. Diese Technologie wäre vor 10 Jahren nicht umsetzbar und in ihrer Annäherung nur von Großunternehmen, Staaten und wenigen Individuen bezahlbar gewesen. Das gleiche gilt für fast jedes andere Produkt und Dienstleistung. Nebenbei, selbst wenn die Reallöhne stagnieren, können sich die Menschen damit bessere leisten.
Wettbewerb sorgt dafür, dass Deutschland trotz geringerer durchschnittlicher Arbeitsstunden produktiver ist als andere europäische Staaten. Wir haben einen starken Binnenwettbewerb (wo nicht staatlich verhindert) der uns für die Globalisierung fit macht. Glaubst du der Rest der Welt wird einfrieren, wenn Europa sich dem Wettbewerb verweigert? Die BRIC/TIGER Staaten entdecken mehr und mehr den freien Markt und Wettbewerb für sich, wovon Deutschland bisher stark profitiert. Anders verhält es sich in manch anderen Staaten Europas: Deindustrialisierung und damit massive wirtschaftliche Probleme die deinen, vermutlich, sehr geliebten Wohlfahrtstaat ein Ende bereiten werden, wenn dem nicht entgegengewirkt wird. Verstehst du den Zusammenhang von Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und Wohlfahrtsstaat? Das erstgenannte ist die Voraussetzung, das hat einmal die SPD mit Schröder richtig erkannt.

&gt;Bitte keine hohlen Phrasen. Was soll das den sein dein Massstab für Zentralisierung? Wo hast du das den gelernt? Mal abgesehn davon, dass du anscheinend keine Ahnung hast was der Zentralismus in Wirklichkeit ist (deine Benutzung oben war schon falsch. Ich hatte dennoch gehofft, dass du es bei der Antwort merkst), deine kreative Art und Weise diese in Stufen zu unterteilen veranschaulicht wunderbar die ""unwissenschaft"" der BWL. Da würdest du damit wahrscheinlich sogar noch durchkommen. Woanders machst du dich nur lächerlich.

Welcher Kategorie gehörte denn mein Vergleich an? War das ein wirtschaftliches Argument? Nein. Nebenbei, Griechenland wird mit der derzeitigen Politik nicht wieder auf die Beine kommen und die Europakriese ist in ihrem Anfang, nicht Ende.

&gt;Argentinien ist so ein super Beispiel. Danke dafür.
Das Land verfügt über enorme Bodenschätze und wurde Jahrzehntelang immer weiter privatisiert. Parallel dazu konnte sich trotz unglaublicher Erlöse aus der Privatwirtschaft, der (ebenfalls von der Privatwirtschaft geschmierte) Staat nicht erholen und das ganze System brach zusammen. Super oder?

Was Argentinien betrifft: Interessanterweise werden immer (von einem bestimmten Menschenschlag) die Ressourcen des Landes genannt. Argentinien ging mit diesen Ressourcen bankrott, also sind nicht die Ressourcen die Lösung des Problems, sondern eine andere Variable. Was hat Argentinien konkret verändert um sich zu erneuern?

&gt;  Das ist es was die o.g. Politik herbeiführt. Witzig war auch wie Argentinien mit dem Geld des IWF umging. Nämlich wie Island auch. Sie haben die Privatgläubiger nicht bezahlt. 

Du meinst Privatgläube haben ihre Investments verloren? Meine Güte! Nieder mit der radikalen freien Marktwirtschaft! 

&gt;Da würden deinen AfD freunden die Hosen platzen vor Hass und Wut :D

Ich kenne niemanden bei der AfD.

&gt;Ich bin sicher das ist komplett abgeprallt an deinem Weltbildschutzschild. Du bist ja auf keine der Konkreten Themen wirklich eingengangen. Ausflüchte, Fehlgriffe und Andeutungen. Try again.

Ich bezweifle dass du irgendeine Ahnung von Wirtschaft besitzt, bisher hast du nicht mal im Ansatz ein Modellverständnis von Wirtschaft aufgezweigt. Bist du ein Anhänger Keynes? Monetarismus von Friedman? Oder doch lieber Marx? Weist du was Makroökonomie ist? Wie man die Sparquote berechnet, so die VWL-Basis Kenntnisse? Vielleicht hast du tatsächlich mehr Wissen als sich erkennen lässt, aber die Polemik legt sich wie ein roter Nebelschleier über deine Kommentare.

&gt;The french government spoke to the whole country, not only french south, so no they used french to do so. The press or TV doesn't stop at a magical border at half the country y'know.

But southern France didn't speak French. How is it fair for the French government to ignore half its citizens when addressing the nation?

My parents speak a lot of languages, including English. In fact, multilingualism is quite common in people born during or after the 70s. However, that's besides the point.

For example, these are examples of public sector jobs (taken from your link, in facT)

&gt;* Direct administration funded through taxation; the delivering organization generally has no specific requirement to meet commercial success criteria, and production decisions are determined by government.
* **Publicly owned corporations** (in some contexts, especially manufacturing, ""state-owned enterprises""); which differ from direct administration in that they have greater commercial freedoms and are expected to operate according to commercial criteria, and production decisions are not generally taken by government (although goals may be set for them by government).
* Partial outsourcing (of the scale many businesses do, e.g. for IT services), is considered a public sector model.

So, according to that model it would include the entire of the armed forces, the entire of the health service and virtually everyone employed by the ~~crown~~ *state*. Where as the number of employees in the European Commission is limited only to civil servants and the 27(28) members of the European Commission. So your figure includes far more than simply the Danish civil service.

However, the British civil service has roughly 500,000 people in it compared to the Civil Service of the European Union which is a meagre 23,000 people. Also, for reference the UK private sector (the statistic you used for Denmark) is 5.7 million.

Well, in a way yes. Any sovereignty given to a supranational organisations will look a bit like federalism but I'd prefer to think of the EU as a quasi-federal; federal only in certain agreed areas by the terms of a reversible treaty (as opposed to a constitution or act of political union). We are not one state that has various areas but instead many states that join together under a treaty to achieve certain aims. It may be that a closer political union is the ultimate future for the EU but I think it is in the EU's interests to hold off on any plans to encourage such a union given the instability of the union at the moment. I honestly would not be averse to that idea but at least a generation (40-50 years) needs to pass before it is seriously worked towards.

A German would still never say Kaninchen as a Nickname, because it does not sound sweet, it is too long and jeah you do think more about the Animal then a Nickname or a Person.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; The analogy is outrageous. Argentina, like dozens of countries before and after it, had opted to peg its currency to another, namely the dollar. In fact, this is not unusual in international economics. The 17 members of the eurozone, on the other hand, have chosen to denounce their own currencies and ""irrevocably"" adopt another. I sometimes wonder how the hell people cannot see the difference here: the drachma, the lira, the deutsche mark, simply do not exist today. Hence, no one can unpeg them from the euro or the dollar. Let me put it another way: Argentina devalued its own currency; Greece will have to introduce another one. The new currency will not be the drachma of the 1990s. It will just have the same name as the drachma.

The analogy people are making is that the economic effect of pegging your currency to another, stronger currency, is similar to the effect of discontinuing your currency and adopting a new one outside your control. To put it another way, if the eurozone countries kept their currencies but pegged them to each other, the same problems would pop up more or less. 

Obviously the analogy breaks down when it comes to logistics, because removing a peg is much easier than completely changing a currency. No one that I know of has ever denied this.

&gt; And that brings us to my second point. The term ""United States of Europe,"" which is so often used in the British press, mistakenly likens the EU to the USA and implies that Brussels is (or soon will be) the capital of a federal state. Nothing could be further from the truth. In every single federal state in the world, the central government is responsible for ""high politics"", most notably defence, foreign policy and budget. Local governments, in turn, are relatively free to decide on ""low politics"" issues, like schools, healthcare, etc. What happens in the EU is exactly the opposite. Its member states are close allies (most are members of Nato anyway), but they do not have a common defence policy. There is some degree of coordination in foreign affairs, but rarely unanimity, let alone central planning. And the central budget of the EU is just 1% of the region's total GDP. The nation states collect taxes and decide where and how they will spend most of their money. The fiscal pact, which was voluntarily signed between sovereign EU governments, just puts a limit on how much they are allowed to spend.

But wasn't the US more or less like the EU before they federalised in these matters? I think the author of the article compares different historical periods than the people who make this analogy.

Anyway, this whole article can be summarised as follows: Some analogies people use are not equivalence relationships. You're not allowed to use analogies unless the situations are the same in all respects.

true,umman,null,null,"&gt; Du hast schon diese Antwort nicht mehr verdient, erwarte keine weitere.

Och wie gütig von dir. Du solltest mir eher danken, dass ich dir solch einen einfachen Ausweg gebe. Weglaufen kann jeder. 

&gt; Ich fasse zusammen: Wettbewerb ist böse. Immerhin kritisiert du Subvention, Subventionen sind per se Wettbewerbsverzerrung auf Kosten aller, auch Arbeitgeber. Ich schreibe aller, da letztlich auch die verlieren, die von einzelnen Subventionen profitieren. 

Und wieder beleidigst du mich. Nur weil es nicht auf eine solch simple Art und Weise passiert wie ich es tue, macht es das nicht besser. Eigentlich macht es das schlimmer.

Wo habe ich den solch verallgemeinernde Antworten gegeben? Wo habe ich gesagt, daß Wettbewerb böse ist? Lustigerweise taucht das Wort ""FAIR"" bei dir nicht mehr auf. Wo ist das den geblieben? Ist es von ""FREI"" überfahren worden? BÖSE kann er gerne sein wenn es darum geht mir was in den Mund zu legen...lächerlich und auch wieder beleidigend. 

&gt; Aber kommen wir zurück zum bösen Wettbewerb: Es ist die Entscheidung der einzelnen Personen wo sie arbeiten und für welches Gehalt....

Ich überspringe mal diese lächerliche Rede aus dem FDP Handbuch für junge Kapitalisten und komme zum Beispiel weil die immer so super gewählt sind bei dir.

&gt; Wettbewerb ist es zu verdanken, dass Smartphones mittlerweile für 100,-€ jedem zur Verfügung stehen.

Ist das so? Mal abgesehn davon, dass so etwas wie ein 100€-IPhone nicht existiert, entspricht das vielleicht den Herstellungskosten. Verkauft wird es für das 4 bis 5-fache. Willst du mir erzählen das wären die Entwicklungskosten? Kommen wir zurück zu den Porduktionskosten: warum sind die so niedrig? Vielleicht wegen der Sklavenarbeit die die Leute dazu bringt aus den Fenstern der Fabriken zu springen?

Das willst du hier in Deutschland? Warum verkauft das die AfD dann nicht offen? 

Lächerlich. Wieder versuchst du mich für dumm zu verkaufen bzw. mich zu beleidigen. 

&gt; Diese Technologie wäre vor 10 Jahren nicht umsetzbar und in ihrer Annäherung nur von Großunternehmen, Staaten und wenigen Individuen bezahlbar gewesen. Das gleiche gilt für fast jedes andere Produkt und Dienstleistung.

Ja sicher. Deswegen gibt es ja auch kein Android. Keine Android Handys überhaupt. Apple hat auch den Hancomputer ERFUNDEN. Gibt nur Aplle mit ihren 100€ Handys....

...meine Güte wie tief willst du noch fallen?

&gt; Nebenbei, selbst wenn die Reallöhne stagnieren, können sich die Menschen damit bessere leisten. Wettbewerb sorgt dafür, dass Deutschland trotz geringerer durchschnittlicher Arbeitsstunden produktiver ist als andere europäische Staaten. Wir haben einen starken Binnenwettbewerb (wo nicht staatlich verhindert) der uns für die Globalisierung fit macht. 

Ok erstmal: wtf Deutsch? Bist du langsam in Rage gekommen?

Den ersten Satz hab ich gar nicht verstanden. Sie können sich besseres leisten oder sie können MEHR leisten? Da ist schon ein Unterschied...nichts von beidem Macht irgendwie Sinn aber ich kann mich nicht passend darüber lustig machen wenn ich es nicht verstehe.

Wettbewerb macht Deutschland produktiver. Aha. Wie macht er das den? Fahren die LKWs schneller weil der Pole schon an der Grenze Wartet? Drehen sich die Bänder schneller als in anderen Ländern? Was geht nur vor in deinem Kopf? Die einzige Produktivitätssteigerung die du jetzt noch rausholen kannst aus den Deutschen ist zu verhindern, dass sie krank werden...Mein Gott man. Denk doch mal nach. Wenigstens einen kurzen Augenblick. Du musst ja nicht über 2 Ecken denken. Nur die direkte Schlussfolgerung von dem was du schreibst...

Ich hab keine Ahnung was du mit der Phrase ""für Globalisierung fit"" sagen wolltest. Stand sicher auch auf dem FDP-Flyer. Bezweifle auch stark, dass du das erklären wirst angesichts des Failtheaters oben drüber.  Hat aber auch nicht wirklich was mit dem Thema zu tun weil wir hier über den EUROPÄISCHEN BINNENMARKT reden und das exploiten von billigen Arbeitskräften IN DEUTSCHLAND um die EUROPÄISCHE Konkurzenz zu killen. So viel zum Zentralismus...

&gt;Deindustrialisierung und damit massive wirtschaftliche Probleme die deinen, vermutlich, sehr geliebten Wohlfahrtstaat ein Ende bereiten werden, wenn dem nicht entgegengewirkt wird. Verstehst du den Zusammenhang von Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und Wohlfahrtsstaat? 

Ahahahahahah oh man ey...wenn du denkst es geht nicht mehr kommt von irgendwo ein Wannabe NeoCon her :D

Deindustrialisierung ist eine FOLGE DER NEOKONSERVATIVEN MARKTPOLITIK :D Wie das an dir vorbei gegangen sein konnte ist mir schleiderhaft. Offensichtlich hast du überhaupt keine Ahnung von Wirtschaft. Das tut mir echt leid, dass ich dir den BWL Vorschlag vorgehalten hab. Weisst du was BWL ist? Zur Deindustrialisierung schlage ich dir mal das googlen nach der Wirtschaft von Grossbritanien z.B. Ich gehe an dieser Stelle gar nicht auf die Zustände in den PIIGS-Ländern ein. Das würde dich nur überfordern und am Ende kommst du eh nur um zu heulen, dass ich mich über dich lustig gemacht hab.

Etwas kurzes zum Wohlfahrtsstaat. Die Wohlfahrtsstaaten in der EU sind oben. Denen geht es super. Die die keine sind, sind unten. Die sind pleite :p

&gt; Welcher Kategorie gehörte denn mein Vergleich an? War das ein wirtschaftliches Argument? Nein. Nebenbei, Griechenland wird mit der derzeitigen Politik nicht wieder auf die Beine kommen und die Europakriese ist in ihrem Anfang, nicht Ende.

Dein ""Verlgeich"" gehörte zu der Kategorie: ""Mama ich habe Pipi gemacht"". Es ist nicht überraschend, dass du unfähig bist auf meine Kritik einzugehen. Deine Massstäbe von Zentralismus sind nicht aus dieser Welt und widersprechen den Gesetzen von Logik und Physik :D

&gt; Nein. Nebenbei, Griechenland wird mit der derzeitigen Politik nicht wieder auf die Beine kommen und die Europakriese ist in ihrem Anfang, nicht Ende.

Ich bin sicher dafür hast du auch eine Lösung. Mmmmh lass mich nachdenken...wir könnten doch die Griechen auf die andere Seite des Mittelmeers schicken und eine gigantische, zentralistische Sandburg bauen lassen. Da könnte man dann die ganzen Wirtschaftswissenschaflter wie dich reinschicken und warten bis es regnet....mein Gott Junge...ich hoffe nur, dass du noch ein Kind bist. 

&gt; Argentinien ging mit diesen Ressourcen bankrott, also sind nicht die Ressourcen die Lösung des Problems, sondern eine andere Variable. Was hat Argentinien konkret verändert um sich zu erneuern?

Soll das bedeuten, dass du auch unfähig bist das zu verstehen was ich geschrieben habe? Natürlich sind nicht die Ressourcen aus dem Boden gehüpft und haben all die Schulden gemacht. Ich habe doch oben schon geschrieben, dass u.a. die Privatisierung (private Eigner von Minen, Hatch-fonds, etc.) diese Probleme verursacht haben und als Konsequenz nicht entschädigt wurden. Das hat Argentinien geholfen. verstehst du das jetzt?

&gt; Ich kenne niemanden bei der AfD.

Inzwischen glaube ich dir das auch. Die Typen von der AfD verstehen wenigstens ihre eigene Show. Du hast schon lange den Faden verloren :D

&gt;Ich bezweifle dass du irgendeine Ahnung von Wirtschaft besitzt, bisher hast du nicht mal im Ansatz ein Modellverständnis von Wirtschaft aufgezweigt. Bist du ein Anhänger Keynes? Monetarismus von Friedman? Oder doch lieber Marx? Weist du was Makroökonomie ist? Wie man die Sparquote berechnet, so die VWL-Basis Kenntnisse? Vielleicht hast du tatsächlich mehr Wissen als sich erkennen lässt, aber die Polemik legt sich wie ein roter Nebelschleier über deine Kommentare.

Du gehst für mich in die Geschichte ein. Ich bin schon eine Weile hier auf reddit aber ich habe ohne Mist noch nie jemanden gesehn der nach solch einer plamablen Vorstellung von Halb- bis Unwissen, eine dermassen peinliche Rede auf sein angebliches Können gebracht hat (+1 von mir!). Das hatte schon etwas theatralisches. Wie du diese Namen aneinander gereiht hast. Was war das? Wiki ""Wirtschaft""? VWL-Kenntnise? Really? Von dem Typen der die Weltwirtschaft mit einem Autokauf erklärt? :D

Rofl oh man. Danke danke danke.

Das macht meinen Feierabend noch viel schöner :D

true,miramarco,lurker,,"&gt; your fabulous train system

Surely you can't be serious.

&gt; What are you favorite websites to book trains? or are seats of great availability and can be booked at the station?

Unless you are travelling across the Italian border, you have to choose between [Trenitalia](http://www.trenitalia.com) and [Italo](http://www.italotreno.it) (NTV). These are their official websites; book through them.

Trenitalia is the only one who operates the ""regionale"" and ""regionale veloce"", which are the slow local trains. Both Trenitalia and Italo operate long-distance travels; Trenitalia also makes a distinction between ""InterCity"", ""FrecciaRossa"", ""FrecciaBianca"", ""FrecciArgento"", ""EuroStar"", etc., the latter being faster, more expensive and, in general, a better travel experience.

You can book your seats at the station, provided that it has a ticket service (some rural stations don't). Be aware that you can't book seats on a regionale or a regionale veloce: you buy your ticket (at the station or at a news-stand) and take whatever seat you want.

&gt; What websites would you recommend to familiarize my self with your bus systems?

Each city and area has its local bus service. An incomplete list is:

* Venice: [urban lines](http://www.actv.it/), [intercity service](http://www.fsbusitalia.it/), [intercity service with eastern cities and the seaside](http://www.atvo.it/?lang=en).

* Florence: [urban lines](http://www.ataf.net), [intercity service](http://www.fsbusitalia.it/).

* Rome: [urban lines &amp; subway](http://www.atac.roma.it/).

* Naples: [urban lines](http://www.anm.it/).

(Other users who are more familiar with those cities may add some.)

&gt; Any Tips, Advice?

Don't ask for punctuality. When you make your plans, consider a plan B in case you miss a connection.

Some trains are overcrowded. Deal with it.

Be careful; avoid pickpockets, beggars and people who stop you for surveys or whatever reason. Avoid looking like a tourist.

You need to stamp your ticket before boarding the train. If the stamp is unreadable, or the machine ran out of ink, you're supposed to find the ticket inspector and explain yourself. Do not stamp the ticket twice.

Always travel with an ID card or a passport.",0,1369156055,null,0,false,0,ca347pr,t3_1errlt,t1_ca347pr,t3_1errlt,null,1431083035,12,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,12

true,Tabathock,UKGB,United Kingdom,"OK, if you're going to quote me an out of date Paul Krugman article with a superficial set of figure and no economic analysis, lets take a look at what was happening in Argentina in 2011. 

Firstly, that 'boom' you see rested on a China-inspired commodity boom. For it to have continued (remember this is back in 2011) it required the price of Argentinian commodities – which accounted for almost two-thirds of exports, kept rising. In 2013, the commodity boom is now over. 

It is also the result of some 'imaginative' accounting. Gaps were filled by raiding pension funds and central bank reserves. At the same time, inflation was running at more than 20, yes 20%. Those figures which you have, are also based on the fixed government peso-dollar exchange rate. Liquidity is low and the black market rate is now, as it was then around twice as much. Economists who disagreed with the 9% figure were hounded and fined. That's important because Argentinian debt is index-linked and thus the government made huge savings by cooking their books. 

From 2008-2011 state spending rose around 34% a year, tell me how that's sustainable in a bankrupt state. Capital flight was rising, an import-matching system was gradually being implemented. 

Back to 2013, the IMF – who's figures Krugman used – have been saying for the last 7 years that Argentina will go bankrupt again. Truth is relative in that country, what you see is not what you get. 

Iceland acted irresponsibly, Argentina have repeatedly lied. I'd rather shit in my hands and clap than invest in that country. You'd have to have a death wish.

du weißt, ich kümmere mich einen Scheiß um dich, um das deutsche Volk oder um die Umwelt. Dennoch schreibe ich dir, da es mein innerstes Verlangen ist dich zu beeinflussen. Du weißt, die EU möchte die Schadstoff-Grenzwerte so ändern, dass wir armen Automobilbauer nur noch dazu in der Lage wären Motoren herzustellen, die weniger als drei Liter Hubraum haben. Im schlimmsten Fall müssten wir sogar dafür Geld aufbringen, diese Motoren spritsparender zu konstruieren.

Und wenn man sich nur noch Autos kaufen kann, die unter drei Liter Hubraum besitzen, verstößt das schon fast gegen die Würde des Menschen! Die EU tritt die Menschenrechte damit erneut mit Füßen und möchte alles noch mehr in Richtung Planwirtschaft und Real-Sozialismus verschieben. Möchtest du wieder so leben, wie in der DDR? Möchtest du, dass alle armen deutschen Bürger mit mickrigen Autos mit nur 2,5l Hubraum und gerademal 300 PS unterwegs sind?

Genau deswegen bin ich so aufgebracht und kann kaum mehr eine Nacht ruhig schlafen.

Auch wenn wir sowieso bereits 80% unserer manuellen Arbeiten nach Asien outgesourced haben und die restlichen 20% Arbeit hier von Maschinen übernommen werden, darf es nicht dazu kommen, dass wir durch solche Bestimmungen so dermaßen drangsaliert werden. Unsere hauseigenen Wissenschaftler haben berechnet, dass die Arbeitskosten dadurch um 4€ pro Auto steigen würden und wir damit nicht mehr mit Konkurrenzprodukten aus China konkurrieren könnten. Die deutsche Wirtschaft würde den Bach runter gehen und wir wären nicht mehr dazu in der Lage einen Rekordgewinn nach dem anderen zu erzielen.

&gt; * What is being compared? Microorganism concentration data (E. coli &amp; Enterococcus).

&gt; * What do the top countries have in common? No (Cyprus, Malta, Romania) or very few (Greece, Croatia) measurements of inland bathing waters. Lakes obviously have higher concentrations of microorganisms than coastal waters, given the same exposure to waste &amp; sewage.

They have their niche (like cheap international calls, they're popular with immigrants who want to call back home) but they're not going to cause anyone to lose lots of customers any time soon.

I'm not sure if you realize how good you have it. The market in the UK is far more energetic.

MVNOs here do not make any serious efforts to undercut the major players. The Netherlands has some of the world's most expensive prices for mobile calling and data, not because the infrastructure is more expensive than in neighboring countries, but because there's no real urgency to competition.

It is actually cheaper to take a Dutch phone to another EU country and use it there under EU-regulated roaming fees, than to use a la carte minutes from the major Dutch mobile operators (KPN, Vodafone, T-Mobile) while at home in the Netherlands. 

&gt; It would still mean that the hypothetical Romanian company would have to pay Vodafone for access to their network at whatever price Vodafone sets, based on the cost of doing business in the UK, not in Romania. The really big expenses like network equipment, engineers, backhaul links and so on won't change because of this, since this is up to Vodafone to provide, not the company buying access to their network.

true,supterfuge,IDF,Ile-de-France,"Les 5 albums **de rap français** que je proposerais, pour ma part :


 1. **Le plus ancien** : *[Touche d'Espoir](http://grooveshark.com/s/Touche+D+espoir/2tCzD2?src=5)*, d'Assassin.

*Pourquoi* : Après la B.O de La Haine (L'État assassine), Assassin a sorti des morceaux absolument monstrueux. Même si leur EP L'Odyssée suit son cours est sans doute le meilleur, Touche d'Espoir a tendance à être à la fois excellent et à attaquer plusieurs sujets à la fois. De plus, Assassin est un groupe mythique du rap français, et écouter cet album montrera bien pourquoi.

*Les meilleurs morceaux* : Touche d'espoir, [État policier](http://grooveshark.com/s/Etat+Policier/4hskFz?src=5) 


2. **Le moins rap** : Les Contes du Chaos, de Casey, B.James et Zone Libre

*Pourquoi* : Les Contes du Chaos est issu de l'association d'Anfalsh (un collectif de rappeur regroupant entre autres La Rumeur, Casey ou Al) et de Zone Libre, le groupe crée par Serge Teyssot Gay après qu'il ai quitté Noir Désir. C'est un rap de fils d'immigré (nom qu'Anfalsh donne à son rap, par opposition au rap français) particulièrement bien écrit et violent (""Fauteurs de troubles, fraudeurs d'allocs // Plaqués au mur, palpés au froc // Victimes du proc', ceux qui provoquent tous les grands mots de l'époque"")

*Les meilleurs morceaux* : [Toujours les mêmes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwEWdoDBP3Y), [Vengeance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9qTO5g8Tac) ( Surtout pour la partie de Casey, B. James étant largement moins bon sur ce morceau à mon avis), [Carnet de ma cage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBDAc3Dxlu4).


3. **Le plus violent** : L'ombre sur la mesure, de La Rumeur

*Pourquoi* : Sans doute le meilleur album de ce rap de fils d'immigré (J'ai hésité à mettre à la place Libérez la Bête de Casey, mais je l'avais déjà cité, et je ne voulais pas que ça se voit que je suis un fanboy), il doit sa place dans cette liste à toutes ses composantes : les instrus, très jazzy et old school, font que les morceaux sont tous très naturels. Les textes sont à la fois particulièrement violents (Bien plus violent qu'un texte de LIM ou Rohff), tout en étant particulièrement intelligents. La Rumeur a réussi à ne pas tomber dans le rap de certains, qui, pour que leur message soit légitimé par les médias mainstream, en ont retiré toute la violence des arguments. Eux ne l'ont pas fait. On se retrouve avec des morceaux comme *Les petites annonces du carnage* ( ""A vendre, mine d'or dans le désert // 2000 têtes pour 2000 tonnes à extraire, frais d'exploitation dérisoires // Par employé, 10 grammes de pain + eau croupie à boire."")

*Les meilleurs morceaux* : [Le Cuir usé d'une valise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OotJ7hnh1l8), [À 20 000 lieues de la mer](http://grooveshark.com/s/20000+Lieues+De+La+Mer/3B6Obt?src=5), [Les petites annonces du carnage](http://grooveshark.com/s/Les+Petites+Annonces+Du+Carnage/4yPDrK?src=5).

4. **Le plus consensuel** : Mon Refuge, de L'Indis

*Pourquoi*: Comme je l'ai écrit, c'est de très loin le plus consensuel de la liste. L'Indis montre un côté plus sympathique du rap, moins violent. C'est ce que j'imagine quand on me parle de rap commercial ... Ou en tout cas, c'est ce que j'aimerais voir. Peu de revendications politiques, c'est juste du plaisir. Et c'est formidable. La plume est géniale, et si on aime le genre, les instrus sont super agréables. Beaucoup de jeux de mots dans ses textes (J'ai encore en texte, sur un feat sur l'album d'un autre rappeur ""50 000 € t'auras une carrière skyrockambolesque // Laurent Beaunnau oeufs d'or transforme le toc en rolex"") et de références à la culture classique française (""On parle argot comme Ferdinand Céline, mais on ne sera jamais artistes // Que des intermittents, c'est ce que je me dis en terminant ces lignes"")

*Les meilleurs morceaux* : [Barbaq de Printemps](http://grooveshark.com/s/Barbaq+De+Printemps/4Ip8HM?src=5), [J'aimais le rap](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCGTghMAsGQ) et le meilleur, [Ancien combattant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfkp5JMq6Kc)



Pour le cinquième, j'ai beaucoup hésité. Les trois concurrents au titre étaient [La Haine](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Haine,_musiques_inspir%C3%A9es_du_film), [Mauvais Oeil](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauvais_%C5%93il_(album) et c'est finalement ...



5. **Le plus regretté** : Le Fond et la Forme, par Fabe

*Pourquoi* : Fabe est sans doute le rappeur qui a été le plus oublié du rap français, alors que son influence a été immense. En terme d'influence sur le rap, on peut dire qu'il a été proche de Booba jusqu'en 2000, date à laquelle il a arrêté le rap. Ses phrases sont encore reprises assez régulièrement (Qui prétend faire du rap sans prendre position). On se souviendra aussi d'une des phrases de cet album que Booba reprendra dans *La Lettre* : ""C'est tellement bas que pour en parler faudrait que j'me fasse mal au dos"". On pourrait résumer la pensée et l'art de Fabe à l'une de ses phrases de son album précédent : Si t'es un gangster, t'as pas le temps de rapper. 

*Les meilleurs morceaux* : Celui qu'il faut connaître à tout pris, c'est sans doute [Des Durs, des boss ... des dombis](http://grooveshark.com/s/Des+Durs+Des+Boss+Des+Dombis/3bqU3Y?src=5) qui va afficher Stomy Bugsy, NTM et Booba qui est allé en taule pour avoir braqué un taxi (""Concours du plus con des MCs, Qui s'font la guerre sur des maxis, parlent d'avoir du cash, n'ont pas assez pour prendre un taxi""), au delà de ça, on peut noter la formidable [Lettre au Président](http://grooveshark.com/s/Lettres+Au+Pr+sident/3bqKKN?src=5) dédiée à Jacques Chirac, et enfin [Salon à quatre](http://grooveshark.com/s/Salon+A+4+Feat+Ekoue+Skeazy/3bqwOy?src=5) avec Hamé de La Rumeur et Skeazy ",0,1369161515,null,0,false,0,ca36doa,t3_1erbqz,t1_ca36doa,t3_1erbqz,null,1431082015,4,false,france,t5_2qhjz,4

And right across the avenue Winston Churchill, you have the Petit Palais, which is the beaux-art museum from the city of Paris.

But well, my favorite thing to do, as a parisian, is to relax :).
So i usually go in a park and walk around a little bit. 

Here is what I do when I have nothing to do for a day : 

A long walk in the  east and south-east from paris (5eme- 12eme-13eme).
I live near bercy, so let's start at bercy village (metro cour st emilion).
They have kept the old warehouses to make a shopping center.

From there, walk in the parc de bercy toward the palais omnisport (POPB).

Then, on your left, take the Passerelle Simone de Beauvoir, toward the Bibiliotheque Francois Mitterrand. 

Walk along the seine (direction North-Northwest), you'll see the POPB on the other side of the river, and the ministère de l'economie et des finances. 

You'll be soon arriving near the Gare d'Austerlitz, and the Jardin des plantes from the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle (another thing worth visiting). You can walk around the jardin des plantes if you want.

Take the pont d'Austerlitz to cross the seine (again). 
Take the boulevard de la bastille toward the place de la bastille (follow the canal St Martin, there is some garden on the bank).
 
Arriving on the place de la bastille, take the rue de lyon, and behind the opera, you'll find some stairs to get on the Coulée Verte.

Walk along the coulee verte. 
You'll arrive in the park de reuilly. 

Continue on the coulée verte/allée vivaldi/rue du sahel.
Cross the peripherique (Take the rue edouard lartet).

Now you're in Saint Mandé. take the rue sarcot, then the rue renault (go east) and ... you'll be in the bois de vincennes !

From there, continue eastward in the bois, and you'll be arriving at the Chateau de Vincennes (another thing to visit).

Go south and then west (route royale, av. des tribunes, route des batteries), and you'll find the lac dausmenil.
On the south side of the lake, there is a buddhist temple which you can visit.

Head toward the pelouse de reuilly (west) by the route de la croix rouge.
You'll arrive on the boulevards des marechaux. 

Follow the rue Claude Decaen, then the rue de Wattignies.
When the rue de wattignies ends, take left on the rue proudhon and pass under the railways.
You'll arrive on the place lachambeaudie, with a nice little church :)

Left again on the rue baron leroy, then right on the rue francois truffaud, and you're at metro station cour st emilion again !

It produces spots like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKr9yxDDqr0).  


So, in 2008-2010 PxC gained a lot of votes, especially in local elections where little parties are more likely to enter the political arena. The party got access to many local councils. But then in some towns people let them talk, not just ""sush, that's racism"". Go on, talk. And, oh boy. Let's say PxC's members did not had the best formation in politics.

The parc de Bercy leads to Bercy-Village (near the metro station Cour Saint-Émilion, line 14), where there are various good places to eat or have tea/coffee.

* Classical (""English garden""): the parc de Bagatelle within the bois de Boulogne is amazing.  The rose garden is the most famous part of it, but there's much more of interest.

* Unique and unclassifiable: the jardins Albert Kahn in Boulogne (metro Boulogne Pont de Saint-Cloud), which are themselves a medley of four or five different kinds of gardens.

I don't know where this myth 'the roads in Norway are bad' comes from. My guess is, it is a relic from before Norway became an oil nation. All I know from my own experience, is that the roads of Norway are excellent, throughout the country.

Anyway, to answer OP questions:

* There is plenty of room on the motorways in Scandinavia, despite most are only two lanes.

* There will be Trucks to overtake, but they are often alone or in pairs. You will not come across a truck convoy longer than 4 trucks in Scandinavia.

* You will meet very few racers in Denmark and Norway, and fewer still in Sweden. /u/Skulder is right. Swedes are exceptionally polite and thoughtful drivers.

* Hannover to Norway in one day sounds tough but doable.

Oh, and don't be fooled by road maps of Norway. Maps are flat, Norway is **NOT**. What is marked as a straight primary route on a map, will in reality be a long string of hair pin turns going up and down. But, and I say this again; all the roads are in *great* condition and safe.

I don't want to go down the nationalist road of responding to your attack on the UK with an attack on Ireland. What I will say though is that Ireland's position has to be short lived.

Either the race to the bottom continues, at which point there's no point being in Ireland if you're just there for low corporation tax. Or there's (somewhat) bilateral tax avoidance laws passed, at which point Ireland's corporation tax gets shunted back up to a more reasonable level and you lose the advantage.

The big UK banks pay a shit ton of tax, the companies that snuck off to Ireland don't. 

There's a big appetite to curb tax avoidance, and countries like Ireland who rely on it for tax revenue cannot keep it up forever.

true,Halk,SCOT,Scotland,"Ok. Perhaps 20 years ago the attitude in the UK was more along those lines, however since then attitudes have changed and it's no longer considered a ""deviation"" to be gay.

Assuming that English is not your first language, you might not understand the very heavy tones that using the word deviation brings to a conversation. It not only implies that something is not the norm, but it also implies that it is wrong, or sick, or unacceptable.

I believe the UK has advanced morally in that we accept that some people are gay and we generally don't care about it or want to impose our own sexuality on them, or feel threatened by it.

Perhaps over time them paedophiles (and by that I mean people who are sexually attracted to young children) will also be viewed with some level of sympathy, but we're not at that point yet. I've seen and read interviews with paedophiles and in all honesty I have a great deal of sympathy with those who do not want to be attracted to children but cannot help it, and struggle daily to control those urges. 

I do not, of course, have sympathy for paedophiles who act on those urges. It can never be consensual as children cannot give consent.

Assuming that you mean comparing people who are gay and have an active sex life, and people who are paedophiles and have an active sex life I would in the very strongest terms possible suggest that you reconsider this comparison.

Consentual gay sex is quite literally none of mine nor your business, and we should not be passing any judgement on it. Paedophile sex is rape, it is wrong, it ruins children's lives and under no circumstances should it be overlooked.

true,lergnom,SWED,Sweden,"It's not a stupid question, it's actually kind of interesting. If you, as a non-native English speaker, grow up hearing more American English you're obviously more likely to adopt an American accent. Same goes if a certain accent is seen as desirable or cool. I'm guessing some key factors are: 

* How your parents speak English (if at all)
* If you've been exposed to a certain accent before, e.g. through traveling/living abroad
* Which accent is more popular among your peers
* Exposure to certain accents in media

Note that, for most people, their accent is obviously going to be an approximation of the ""actual"" accent. Certain key characteristics of that accent will be incorporated, without being completely accurate. For example, one might consistently pronounce A the American way in words like can't, bath, dance and so forth. It just makes more sense to be somewhat consistent. 

Once you reach a certain level of fluency it's usually not too hard to switch between a couple of general accents at will, much like a native speaker. I've even had friends go through, say, brit pop phases and suddenly affecting a British accent. 

On a final note, some people will never really acquire an accent that could really be called ""British"" or ""American"" (or anything else) - as general as those classifications are (e.g. the stereotypical eastern european bad guy accent).",0,1369172380,null,0,false,0,ca3argo,t3_1ere83,t1_ca3argo,t1_ca38g6q,null,1431079876,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Ireland's tax policy has remained unchanged for 25 years I don't know how exactly then it can be construed that we are engaged in some economic race to the bottom.


It wasn't Irish tax policies that caused the world wide financial collapse.
 
Underregulation in large financial hubs such as London allowed the creation of a complex derivatives market which then collapsed causing the global economic crisis something your Government has failed to even begin trying to fix.


This race to bottom is simply neo liberal capitalism in action. Your government has benefited vastly from this economic system over the years but now realised it can't compete with the likes of Ireland, China, India and other emergent economies.


You therefore want to redraw the rules you helped create to benefit your country at the expense of Ireland there is no reason we should acquiesce to your demands. 


More over. As I said we have a veto on corporation tax. So you have two options you can leave the European Union and re-implement tariffs or you can reinvade.

true,gamberro,IREL,Éire,"Good points, but here's my two cents. Structural problems are a serious issue in the periphery, but not so much in the core. In a number of peripheral European countries there's a two-tier labour market, which makes it quite difficult for young people to get a job. However, there are other ways to bring about change than to force countries that have dangerously high unemployment to render their workforces more flexible. My suggestion would be a common unemployment fund, that would step in to provide support provided governments implemented structural reform programs.

The problem is that the one-size-fits-all approach doesn't suit the Eurozone at all. While the peripheral countries need to cut back on their spending, there is no need for the core to do the same. But time and again the message put forward is that the Eurozone as a whole has no choice but to follow the course of austerity. More aggregate demand in the system would help the peripheral countries restore their public finances. For example, at the moment German three year bonds have an interest rate close to zero and a ten-year rate of 1.5%, so it gets money almost for free. If these countries became more expansionary it would have a relatively fast effect.

&gt;More over. As I said we have a veto on corporation Tax. So you have two options you can leave the European Union and re-implement tariffs or you can reinvade.

We perhaps will leave the European Union - things need to change or we will. Hostile tax arrangements from our European partners is one thing that needs resolution. We're unlikely to re-invade Ireland.

However don't be so sure you've got it all neatly tied up with dodgy tax arrangements.  The big hitters in the EU are setting their sights on Luxembourg, Ireland, Switzerland and the like. And US lawmakers too.

It's fairly plausible to think that within a couple of years any Double Irish, Dutch Sandwich or the like will be specifically targeted with legislation that means there's little point in using Irish tax avoidance schemes.

If there is any immorality it's the Irish government that are responsible. Nobody can deny that Ireland helps companies avoid tax in the UK and US for a smaller cut.

Per essere colpevole di concorso esterno in associazione mafiosa è necessario innanzitutto che ci sia dolo, quindi intenzionalità nel contribuire agli scopi illeciti dell'associazione.

In general I am a bit sceptic to this report. I don't know about the rest of the countries, but I am pretty sure of that the Sweden (where I live) bar is not really representative of the country. There should be a lot more water that is not high quality... I think. 

The reason is that almost all of ""Östersjön"" (Swedish east coast) is considered rather polluted and during the summers have huge problems with somewhat poisonous algaes (or rather, they release neurotoxins)

Sex is more than just a means of procreation, it serves also important social functions. It can be used as what some perceive as a greeting, a means of forming social bonds, a means of conflict resolution, postconflict reconciliation, and sometimes even as a means of establishing dominance.

The primary GM crop in India is Bt Cotton, which is NOT resistant to glyphosate.

&gt;which is very expensive for poor Indian farmers

Good thing they sold them Bt, [which reduces insecticide use by a massive amount — an effect that directly lowers the amount of insecticide poisonings by as many as several million farmers per year](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800911002400).

&gt;The truly criminal part is that they included a sterility gene in the seeds

False! Genetic Use Restriction Technology has NEVER been commercially used.

&gt;which meant that the farmers could not replant part of the seeds gathered from the crop for the next year like they used to do with natural plants

This is a standard practice among both biotech companies and specialized crop breeders. If farmers want the benefits of GM seed, they have to sign a contract that disallows certain practices (like saving seed). However, hybrids have made seed saving more or less obsolete, so they aren't even loosing much. And if they disagree, they're more than welcome to purchase hybrids instead.

&gt;Several deaths in India could be linked directly to this as the result of malnourishment

[citation needed]

&gt;and also desperation suicides of farmers rendered unable to support their families.

Complete bullshit.

true,HappyReaper,null,null,"The failure is not that of multiculturalism, but of how it has been approached. And that's what we have seen until now: policies and their consequences. The problem is that the way it is approached now just causes both ends (immigrants and locals) to feel discriminated against, and keeps adding fuel to the fire. Some basic guidelines that, in my opinion, would lead with time to a successful multicultural society:

* Treat every collective equally. Don't try to combat xenophobia by making sanctions uneven (for instance, ignoring one hate speech while severely punishing another), but also try to address discrimination problems in society (like, sometimes police tends to be harsher on immigrants, or they have higher difficulty finding jobs with the same skill-set).

* Some parts of incoming cultures might be incompatible with local society. Those should already be regulated by law, anyway. Apply them consistently to the individuals who break them, while avoiding punishment for the rest of the collective who don't.

* Other parts might be very different to local culture, but compatible with it (as in, it's possible to coexist with them without having one's rights stepped on). Leave those alone; it's important to understand that an immigrant has the duty to abide by the law (just like a local), but they don't have to adopt the dominant cultural background in their new country. Trying to legislate against cultural traits that aren't hurting anyone will just make people feel attacked, and add fuel to the fire.

That's basically it. If you don't make collectives feel attacked (either because laws are uneven, social treatment is different, or a culture is unnecessarily legislated against), then the current situation of tension between local majorities and some minorities would slowly fade.

Also, it's not only in the governments' hands, or in the minorities', but also in ours: we can make it a little better by, for instance, avoiding blaming whole cultures whenever an individual commits a crime (just like we do not blame all whites whenever a nazi does it in their name), or treating an immigrant the same we would a local, without prejudging them (of course, if someone turns out to be an arsehole, nothing xenophobic about telling them to fuck off, local or immigrant).",0,1369180125,null,0,false,0,ca3djcn,t3_1eqp0d,t1_ca3djcn,t1_ca2yryr,null,1431078568,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

**The mystery of the ""French Spring""**
May 14

Why are the protests against gay marriage so large and persistent? Why are they a unique phenomenon in Europe? The answers are more complex than political experts, who lack historical culture, claim. One has to remember that France has always known a particularly contentious political and intellectual life.

It is France which invented in 1789 Revolution and Counter-Revolution, right wing and left wing, Terror and revolt of the Vendée. It is her which invented in the 19th century bonapartism, the different sorts of royalism and republicanism, and then, in the 20th century, fascism and antifascism. It is her which invented, after 1940, petainism and Gaullism. One cannot ignore that this period ended with an atrocious civil war (1943-1944) and a bloody cleansing."" 

""It is still France which invented, at the end of the Algerian war (1962), an unprecedented military revolt opposing gaullists and anti-gaullists (often former gaullists): several generals imprisoned, as well as a large number of officers and civilians. This same period (1962) has left deep traces in the young generations originating from the Europeans of Algeria (Pieds Noirs). Later, it is still in France that was born, with the Front National, the first large ""populist"" European movement against the afro-maghrebin immigration desired by the globalists.

One has to keep this long contentious history in mind in order to interpret the ""French Spring"". One must also remember that France is the only country in the world (with North Korea) where still exists a communist party that controls a powerful trade union which functions like a mafia using violence. This communist party is the electoral ally of the socialist party in power. One also has to remember that many senior members of the current socialist party are former trotskists who have considerable influence in Education, Justice and the media. This means that contrary to Germany for instance, there still remains in France a potential for civil war which only waits for an opportunity to awaken.""

""And, precisely, after the contemptuous provocations from president Hollande and his government, this gay marriage affair has become the opportunity for peaceful conflict which has thrown hundreds of thousands of opponents into the streets, including young mothers and their children. Initially, the Catholic Church played its role in this mobilization, but then it officially retired. Note by the way that in Spain, where the Church is stronger than in France, gay marriage was adopted without creating such opposition. 

Originally, one could think that the socialist bill on gay marriage was one of those scams that politicians use as a distraction. But then it became clear that behind the scam had slipped one of those perverse projects through which the fanatics of deconstruction and globalisation want to destroy the last remaining frames which structure European societies. One has to remember that marriage is not a question of love. It is not a simple contract, it is an institution designed for the children to come. It guarantees a child an identity represented by a true father and a true mother. That is what the Taubira law wanted to destroy, by replacing the rights of children with the right given to gay adults to treat themselves to children based on the criteria of consumer society.""

""For all those reasons, the gay marriage project was felt as an unbearable attempt on one of the sacred fundaments of our civilisation. Hence the massive popular protests of January 13th and March 24th in Paris, then of May 5th everywhere, until that of May 26th.
The protesters, often very young, are not homogenous. For one part they are non-violent Catholic bourgeois, originating from the WYD, attracted by the new tolerant discourse of the Church in terms of conjugal love. Their references are Gandhi and Martin Luther King… But, for another part, they’re young identitaires mobilised by the insolent dynamism of the protests. Time will tell which of those components will trump the other by its vitality and determination.""",0,1369181526,null,0,false,0,ca3e0ys,t3_1ermm2,t1_ca3e0ys,t1_ca358n4,null,1431078338,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

When you belong to a nation associated with St. Louis, Philip the Fair, Richelieu, Louis XIV, or Napoleon, a country which in the late 17th century, was called the “great nation” (the most populated and most dangerous), it is cruel to recount the history of repeated setbacks: the aftermath of Waterloo, 1870, 1940, and again in 1962, the ignominious end of French rule in Algeria. A certain pride necessarily suffers.

""By the 1930s, many among the boldest French minds had imagined a united Europe as a way to an understanding with Germany and as a solution to the constant decline of France. After the disaster that was World War II (which amplified that of 1914–1918), a project was born that is in itself legitimate. New bloodlettings between the French and Germans should be outlawed forever. The idea was to tie together the two great sister nations of the former Carolingian Empire. First by an economic association (the European Coal and Steel Community), then by a political association. General de Gaulle wanted to make this happen with the Elysée Treaty (January 22, 1963), but the United States, in their hostility, forestalled it by putting pressure on West Germany.

Then came the technocratic globalists who gave us the gas works called the “European Union.” In practice, this is the absolute negation of its name. The fake “European Union” has become the biggest obstacle to a genuine political settlement that respects the particularities of the European peoples of the former Carolingian Empire. Europe, it must be remembered, is primarily a unitary multi-millennial civilization going back to Homer, but it is also a potential power zone and the aspiration for a future that remains to be built.

Why an aspiration to power? Because no European nations today, neither France nor Germany nor Italy, despite brave fronts, are sovereign states any longer.""

""There are three main attributes of sovereignty:

First attribute: the ability to make war and conclude peace. The US, Russia, Israel, or China can. Not France. That was over after the end of the war in Algeria (1962), despite the efforts of General de Gaulle and our nuclear deterrent, which will never be used by France on its own (unless the United States has disappeared, which is unpredictable). Another way to pose the question: for whom are the French soldiers dying in Afghanistan? Certainly not for France, which has no business there, but for the United States. We are the auxiliaries of the USA. Like Germany and Italy, France is a vassal state of the great Atlantic suzerain power. It is best to face this to recover our former pride.

Second attribute of sovereignty: control of territory and population. Ability to distinguish between one’s own people and others . . . We know the reality is that the French state, by its policy, laws, courts, has organized the “great replacement” of populations, we impose a preference for immigrants and Muslims, with 8 million Arab-Muslims (and more waiting), bearers of another history, another civilization, and another future (Sharia).

Third attribute of sovereignty: one’s own currency. We know what that is.

The agonizing conclusion: France, as a state, is no longer sovereign and no longer has its own destiny. This is a consequence of the disasters of the century of 1914 (the 20th century) and the general decline of Europe and Europeans.""

""But there is a “but”: if France does not exist as a sovereign state, the French people and nation still exist, despite all efforts to dissolve them into rootless individuals! This is the great destabilizing paradox of the French mind. We were always taught to confuse identity with sovereignty by being taught that the nation is a creation of the state, which, for the French, is historically false.

It is for me a very old topic of discussion that I had previously summarized in an opinion column published in Le Figaro on February 1, 1999 under the title: “Sovereignty is not Identity.” I’ll put it online one day soon for reference.

No, the sovereignty of the state is not to be confused with national identity. France’s universalist tradition and centralist state were for centuries the enemy of the carnal nation and its constituent communities. The state has always acted relentlessly to uproot the French and transform them into the interchangeable inhabitants of a geographic zone. It has always acted to rupture the national tradition. Look at the July 14 celebrations: it celebrates a repugnant uprising, not a great memory of unity. Look at the ridiculous emblem of the French Republic: a plaster Marianne wearing a revolutionary cap. Look at the hideous logos that have been imposed to replace the arms of the traditional regions. Remember that in 1962 the state used all its strength against the French in Algeria, abandoned to their misery. Similarly, today, it is not difficult to see that the state gives preference to immigrants (construction of mosques, legalizing halal slaughter) at the expense of the natives.""

""There is nothing new in this state of war against the living nation. The Jacobin Republic merely followed the example of the Bourbons, which Tocqueville has demonstrated in The Old Regime and the French Revolution before Taine and other historians. Our textbooks have taught blind admiration for the way the Bourbons crushed “feudalism,” that is to say, the nobility and the communities they represented. What a brilliant policy! By strangling the nobility and rooted communities, this dynasty destroyed the foundation of the old monarchy. Thus, in the late 18th century, the individualistic (human rights) Revolution triumphed in France but failed everywhere else in Europe thanks to the persistence of the feudal system and strong communities. Reread what Renan says in his Intellectual and Moral Reform in France. The reality is that in France the state is not the defender of the nation. It is a machine of power that has its own logic, willingly lent to the service of the enemies of the nation, having become one of the main agents of the deconstruction of identity.""",0,1369182128,null,0,false,0,ca3e887,t3_1ermm2,t1_ca3e887,t1_ca3e0ys,null,1431078243,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

true,keepthepace,ZZZZZZhacker,Hacker,"&gt; On SAIT qu'un bon patron peut tout changer.

Ce qu'on ne sait pas, c'est s'il y a une corrélation entre la compétence du patron et le salaire qu'il est prêt à accepter. Ce n'est pas du tout évident, la corrélation pourrait même être négative. 

&gt; est-ce que l'argent qu'il pourra potentiellement faire gagner en plus à l'entreprise peut justifier un telle salaire?

&gt; il sait pas forcément comment ça marche, c'est trop risqué...""

Les deux jugement que tu proposes, souvent, ne sont étayés par rien sinon par l'apparence de l'évaluation du risque. C'est de là que vient ma métaphore (surement mal amenée) avec le sourcier. Imagine que tu dois creuser un puit. Tu as deux personnes qui te proposent deux emplacements différents. Le premier te dit ""De toutes façons, t'as 20% de chances que ça foire, alors ici ou ailleurs, c'est pareil."" et le deuxième te dit, après avoir scanné toute la zone avec ses baguettes radiesthésiques ""Ah! Ici y a de l'eau! c'est sur! C'est là qu'il faut creuser!"". Humainement, on a tendance à préférer la deuxième pratique, parce que, qu'est ce qu'on risque ? On est même prêt à payer ce pseudo spécialiste assez cher (les sourciers continuent à faire du beurre de nos jours) 

Dans ton cas, tu as deux candidats. Un te dit ""bon ben j'ai jamais géré de grand groupe, alors y a une chance pour que ça foire, c'est sur."" et un deuxième qui te dit ""j'ai déjà géré un grand groupe, donc aucune chance que je n'y arrive pas avec celui ci"" pourtant rien n'indique que leurs chances ne soient pas similaires, ne fut-ce que pour des raisons d'éthique et d'intérêt professionnel : par exemple, on pourrait arguer que le deuxième n'a plus rien à prouver, juste de l'argent à se faire.

&gt; Nen t'as raison, j'ai donné un mauvais argument. Le véritable c'est plutôt que les entreprises française vont couler, et que du coup plus aucunes entreprise n'aura son siège en France. C'est plus indirect.

Je dois dire qu'avec les news d'Apple récemment, qui montre que c'est un taux d'impôt de 0% la nouvelle norme pour les entreprises multinationales, je me dis qu'en effet, faut surement pas mal de motivation pour accepter de jouer un jeu aux règles aussi mal équilibrées. Si tu n'as pas lu les articles, Apple a réussi à n'avoir son siège nulle part, ce qui est le graal fiscal.

Mais là on ne parle pas des impôts des entreprises, mais des revenus des particuliers, qui eux sont tenus d'avoir une résidence fiscale. Or, quelqu'un qui prétendrait habiter au Luxembourg mais qui gère à temps plein une boite située en France, il serait tout à fait dans le collimateur de l'administration fiscale.

&gt; T'as la choix:
&gt;
&gt; * patron expérimenté demande haut salaire
&gt; * patron peu expérimenté demande bas salaire

D'après toi, c'est une impossibilité totale le patron expérimenté qui demande un bas salaire ? Je sais que c'est une hérésie d'offre et de demande, mais pourtant. Des gens passionnés, qui ont l'expérience et l'envie d'aider une boite et sont prêts à accepter un salaire ""modeste"" existent.

&gt; Et quand vous avez ça, vous préferez trouver un endroit où vous serez payé de façon ""correcte"".

Quand être payé de façon ""correcte"" signifie toucher plus de 100 fois le salaire minimum dans la boite, ça implique un certain style de management qui me semble très difficilement compatible avec une gestion humaine de la boite.

&gt; Correct! Leur salaire, pas leur revenus après impôt! Quand l'impôt augmente les patrons augmentent leurs salaires. Diminue l'impôt et il ne pourront plus justifier auprès du conseil un tel salaire.

Ah ouais, c'est  vrai que l'impôt des plus riches a explosé : http://bazas.parti-socialiste.fr/files/taux-marginal-superieur-irpp.png

I don't think there's *any* disagreement out there about just that, hehe. However if there was a major war, where Europe was attacked from the ""outside"", we might actually come together faster and tighter than anyone would have imagined.

&gt; I honestly would not be averse to that idea but at least a generation (40-50 years) needs to pass before it is seriously worked towards. 

At the very least. Even if people liked the idea it takes a long time to  solidify support and make people comfortable. I think it's best done gradually, but increasingly faster. 

I believe Europe needs unity to become a more efficient and competitive economy. Trade is what creates wealth, we're already deeply integrated, and we need to realize our place in the world economy has changed. 

Instead of desperately trying to keep our national champions alive, we should probably let market forces find the most efficient solution within Europe. German manufacturers are profitable, and British engineers already work for them. Why prop up factories artificially?

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; However, there are other ways to bring about change than to force countries that have dangerously high unemployment to render their workforces more flexible.

Actually what is wrong on workforce being flexible? What is the big problem on letting companies do what they do best?

&gt; My suggestion would be a common unemployment fund, that would step in to provide support provided governments implemented structural reform programs.

And who exactly would pay for this? I'm sorry, but this sounds just another way to conduct wealth transfers from well doing countries to troubled ones. Not to mention that when someone else is paying unemployment benefits, then countries with high unemployment have zero initiative to actually deal with the problem.

&gt; More aggregate demand in the system would help the peripheral countries restore their public finances. 

This is more or less false. For this to work increased demand in core countries would need to generate more demand for products and services coming from troubled countries. However the problem is that people really don't need more holiday apartments in Spain not to mention there is only so much that a person can consume olive oil.

&gt;  For example, at the moment German three year bonds have an interest rate close to zero and a ten-year rate of 1.5%, so it gets money almost for free. If these countries became more expansionary it would have a relatively fast effect.

And what exactly they would need to do so that the increased demand in core would trickle down to troubled countries? Lately the increased demand that I have generated has largely gone to Asia, buying new Nikon camera and ordering a new Nokia Lumia (most components come from Asia and assembly is also done there).

The only thing that I have been considering is changing my Toyota to Alfa-Romeo, but the problem with Alfas are that they haven't been designed and manufactured for northern climate. No amount of increase of money in my hands would put me to swap my Toyota to a Alfa, if the quality/endurance isn't there.

Je me permet de donner mon avis cependant. Je ne connais pas bien le hip hop lui même, en revanche j'ai les idées assez claires sur l'influence qu'a eu le genre dans son ensemble sur la musique contemporaine.

L'OP a super raison de s'intéresser au hip-hop. Contrairement aux idées préconçues, le genre est ultra recherché, presque tous les genres trouvent leur inspiration dans les quelques principes fondamentaux du hip-hop, et je dirais même que sans le hip-hop, la pop serait restée piteusement dans son syndrome benet des années 80.

Un des principes du hip-hop est selon moi l'inversion du contrôle du rythme par la mélodie. On ne compose plus au piano ou à la guitare, mais à la plume, à la basse, à la batterie, à la boite à rythme, à la platine ou au jembé. On ne cherche plus à moduler sa voix, mais à la rythmer. La poésie n'est plus chantée mais scandée. Le parolier ne doit plus trouver les mots qui sonnent juste mais faire sonner les mots justes. C'est une totale inversion du processus créatif en musique et la musique toute entière en a profité.

La ligne mélodique est souvent réduite à sa plus simple expression, un gimmick samplé, car son rôle est d'aider à mémoriser, comprendre et reconnaitre le message de la chanson, et non de se suffire à elle-même.

Lorsque l'artiste produit un morceau de rap, il a littéralement tous les pouvoir, et son premier choix n'est jamais déterminant pour tout le reste, c'est pourquoi on retrouve énormément de remix de super bonne qualité, alors que les réarrangements pop sont souvent à peu de choses près semblables à l'original.

Le Hip Hop doit énormément aux genres qui l'ont précédé et donne une toute nouvelle dimension à la reprise musicale: on ne parle plus de plagiat, on n'a plus le droit de parler de plagiat tellement le boulot de mixage réalisé en production est dantesque.

Pour aider à mieux apprécier ce travail de fourmi qui consiste à écumer les bacs à la recherche des riffs géniaux, à les moduler, à les combiner et à les intégrer, chose qui n'était pas possible auparavant, voici l'exemple assez simple de [Kriss Kross - Jump, examiné au microscope par samples.fr](http://www.samples.fr/blog/index.php/2007/12/11/1215-kriss-kross-jump/), ou la genèse d'un hit commercial planétaire du début des années 90 qui a rendu le rap accessible aux ados de tous les pays.

Mais on s'en fou des gens qui ont quelque chose à prouver! On cherche quelqu'un de compétent. Et si le deuxième, sous prétexte de ne plus rien avoir à prouver, fait de la merde bin il aura plus d'emploies et plus de salaire.

&gt;rien n'indique que leurs chances ne soient pas similaires

Bah je sais pas, tu monterais dans un avion où le pilote à 100 heures de vols contre un autre où le pilote a 1000 heures de vols? Attend nen mais je sais pas, évidemment que l'experience joue pour quelque chose, je conçois pas cet argument. Si on part comme ça on pourrait tout aussi bien dire que ça sert à rien de payer l'ancienneté dans une entreprise puisque l'expérience ne compte, ils ont plus rien à prouver...

&gt;Mais là on ne parle pas des impôts des entreprises, mais des revenus des particuliers, qui eux sont tenus d'avoir une résidence fiscale. Or, quelqu'un qui prétendrait habiter au Luxembourg mais qui gère à temps plein une boite située en France, il serait tout à fait dans le collimateur de l'administration fiscale.

Ouiiiiii, mais ce n'est pas le sujet. Le sujet c'est que y aura pas de mec qui viendra gérer de boîte en France, puisqu'aucun de ceux qui sont compétents aura accepté de venir travailler pour un si bas salaire. (j'en perd ma grammaire, désolé pour les fautes éventuelles, je suis pas sûr de moi). Et comme on aura que des patron pourris, bah les boîtes vont couler.

&gt;D'après toi, c'est une impossibilité totale le patron expérimenté qui demande un bas salaire ? Je sais que c'est une hérésie d'offre et de demande, mais pourtant. Des gens passionnés, qui ont l'expérience et l'envie d'aider une boite et sont prêts à accepter un salaire ""modeste"" existent.

Ce n'est absolument pas impossible! Mais faut bien faire la différence entre nous deux: tu es pour forcé les patrons à avoir un bas salaire, je suis pour les laisser faire ce qu'ils veulent.

Et bien que ça existe, il n'y en a pas beaucoup, sûrement pas assez. Donc si tu forces tout le monde à être un bon samaritain, et à travailler pour un salaire ""raisonnable"", les méchant vicieux pleins de frics mais pleins d'experiences qui pourraient souver pas mal de boîte, bah ils vont pas chercher à prendre un poste en France. Alors certe on aura des patrons éthiques, mais on aura un bon taux de chômage du fait des grosses boîtes qui vont coûler (ce qui peut avoir un certain avantage btw, mais je ne pense pas que ce soit ce que tu souhaite).

&gt;Quand être payé de façon ""correcte"" signifie toucher plus de 100 fois le salaire minimum dans la boite, ça implique un certain style de management qui me semble très difficilement compatible avec une gestion humaine de la boite.

Donc si on ne force pas l'égalité, on n'est pas dans une gestion humaine. Nen, je suis désolé, c'est pas ça une gestion humaine. Y a pas que l'égalité dans la vie!

&gt;Ah ouais, c'est vrai que l'impôt des plus riches a explosé

* You can WALK to some places. Also the bus-/subway-system is usually very good and fairly cheap. You are not so dependent on your car
* Pedestrian zones in bigger cities. The city center is often closed to regular traffic so people can freely walk around on their shopping spree
* Most people can talk english, and they will as soon as they find out you are a native english speaker. Don't be offended if they will answer you in english although you are trying to talk german. It's because they don't really often get the chance to practice. This is no insult to your German.

I really liked the Plaza de España also, it´s like a work of art. I didn´t go up the Giralda, but my friends did, and their pictures of the view was pretty cool so maybe that´s also worth a visit. My favorite part of Sevilla are all the local bars and restaurants. There are a ton of great places to eat and drink if you just walk around a bit. The Triana neighborhood is pretty cool for this as well as the surrounding area (can´t remember their names, sorry) but you´ll be able to find a lot of cool things. The main problem I have with Sevilla is that there are a lot of English speakers and people in the restaurants and bars may try to speak to you in English. There are also lots of drunk American study abroaders... beware.

There are some great places near Sevilla that are also worth a visit, like day trips and weekend trips. I highly recommend going to Granada (you want a weekend for that) and visiting the Alhambra and the Albaycin. I didn´t go, but I´ve heard that Córdoba is a wonderful place to visit for a day or two. I´d love to go and see the mezquita. I would also recommend taking some weekend trips to the beach-- if you must, go to Cádiz, the old town is pretty, but the real gems are outside of it. One place I would recommend is Conil de la Frontera, beautiful beaches and cliffs about 45 minutes south of Cádiz. If you can rent a car or have a friend with one, taking a trip along the Andalucía coast is amazing and I highly recommend driving it along the coast towards and past Málaga. Beautiful scenery- pueblos blancos, stunning beaches and you can see Africa across the coast.

Andalucía is great, there is obviously a lot of tourism so make the effort to speak Spanish with the locals at the bars and restaurants (especially if you´re studying). It´s really beautiful and tons of things to do. RyanAir also flies out of Sevilla if you are looking for longer weekend trips, just pay attention to their rules.

There was a mother fox and a father fox, as well as two children Foxes, one boy and one girl. Mutter Fuchs und Vater Fuchs und ihre zwei Kinder, ein Junge und ein Mädchen.


They lived happily in their fox hole all year long.  Das ganze Jahr über lebten sie glücklich in ihrem Fuchsbau.

The boy was named Simon and the girl was named Lulu. Der Junge hiess Simon und das Mädchen hiess Lulu.

The young foxes like to play in the lake by their home. Die jungen Füchste liebten es am See in der Nähe ihres Hauses zu spielen.

Swimming and splashing with the other forest critters. Sie schwammen und planschten mit den anderen Tieren aus dem Wald.

They know not to swim to the other end of the lake, for they knew there was coyote’s den. Sie wussten, dass sie nicht zum anderen Ufer des Sees schwimmen durften, weil dort der Bau von den Kojoten lag.


“Come on, guys! I bet you can’t swim to the far end!” mocked Simon. ""Kommt schon Freunde! Ich wette ihr schafft es nicht bis zum anderen Ufer zu schwimmen!"" mokierte Simon.


“Simon, Mother and Father told us that the end is forbidden!” exclaimed Lulu. ""Simon, Mama und Papa haben es uns doch verboten!"" sagte Lulu.


“What are you, afraid?? Ha!” torted Simon. ""Hast du etwa Angst? HA!"" stichelte Simon.


Simon swam off with the other critters and left Lulu on her own. Simon liess Lulu alleine zurück und schwamm mit den anderen Tieren davon.

Lulu heard them giggle and tease each other on the way. Lulu hörte die anderen auf dem Weg kichern und sich gegenseitig anstacheln.


It was not long after they left that she heard screams of horror and fear. Es dauerte nicht lange und sie hörte furchterfüllte Schreie.


The coyote had snatched them away into her den. Der Kojote hatte sie geschnappt und sie in seinen Bau gebracht. 


The coyote  mother was waiting for the father to come back with the cubs so that they could eat. Die Kojote Mutter wartete auf Vater Kojote und die Welpen, damit sie gemeinsam essen konnten.


Lulu ran as fast as she could back the the fox hole to tell her parents. Lulu rannte so schnell sie konnte zurück zum Fuchsbau zu ihren Eltern.


“Mother! Father! Simon and his friends have been snatched by the Mother Coyote! You must help!” Lulu cried. ""Mama! Papa! Simon und seine Freunde wurden von der Kojoten Mutter geschnappt! Ihr müsst ihnen helfen!"" weinte Lulu.


“We have a special way to deal with this, Lulu” explained Father. ""Wir haben eine besondere Art und Weise damit umzugehen, Lulu"" erklärte Papa Fuchs.


“What’s that??” questioned Lulu. ""Wie denn??"" fragte Lulu.


Father said, “We have a special potion buried near the lake for just this special purpose. Papa Fuchs sagte:""Wir haben einen speziellen Zaubertrank in der nähe des Sees extra für diesen Zweck vergraben.


We use it on the mother coyote to make her fall asleep. Wir werden ihn an Mutter Kojote anwenden damit sie in einen tiefen Schlaf fällt.


It does not harm her, just makes her fall asleep.” Ihr wird nichts geschehen, sie wird nur tief schlafen.""


“Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!” said Lulu excitedly. "" Los! LOS! Lasst uns gehen!"" sagte Lulu, die sehr aufgeregt war.


The remnants of the fox family made their way to the burial site to get the potion. Der Rest der Fuchsfamilie machte sich auf den Weg zur Stelle, wo der Zaubertrank vergraben war, um diesen zu holen.


They immediately found it and gave it to Lulu. Sie haben ihn sofort gefunden und gaben ihn an Lulu.


“Lulu you must take this with you into the coyote’s den. ""Lulu, du musst den Trank an dich nehmen wenn du in den Bau der Kojoten gehst.


You are the only one left to fool her into thinking you’re edible as well,” Mother explained. Du bist die einzige, die die Kojoten Mutter dazu bringen kann zu denken, dass du auch noch zur Mahlzeit gehörst."" erklärte Mama Fuchs.


“That’s scary! I don’t want to do that! I can’t!” fought Lulu. ""Das macht mir Angst! Ich will das nicht machen, ich kann nicht!"" erwiderte Lulu.


“Now Lulu, you must. It’s the only way you can save your brother Simon and your friends. You want to do that, don’t you?” questioned Father. ""Lulu, hör mal. Du musst das tun, das ist der einzige Weg die anderen Tiere und deinen Bruder zu retten. Du willst sie doch retten, oder?"" fragte Papa Fuchs.


“Yesssss, but it is going to be scary. I shall do it for Simon!” said Lulu half-heartedly. ""Ja, schon, aber... das wird sehr gruselig, aber für Simon werde ich es tun!"" sagte Lulu etwas zitternd.


Lulu made her way across the lake with the special potion in hand to play victim for the mother coyote. Lulu machte sich auf den Weg zum anderen Ufer mit dem speziellen Zaubertrank in der Hand um das Opfer für Mutter Kojote zu spielen.


“Owww! My paw!” cried Lulu in front of the den. ""Aua, meine Pfote!"" weinte Lulu direkt vor dem Bau der Kojoten.


The Mother coyote thought to herself, “What a wonderful addition to dinner!” and brought Lulu to
the den. Mutter Kojote dachte:""Was für eine schöne Beilage fürs Essen!"" und brachte Lulu in den Bau.


 Lulu was dragged into the den and met up with her friends and brother. Lulu wurde in den Bau geschleift und traf dort auf die anderen.


Lulu said, “I am coming to help rescue you all.” Lulu flüsterte:""Ich bin hier um euch zu retten!""


“How??” Simon inquired. ""Wie?"" fragte Simon.


“You will see.” ""Werdet ihr schon sehen.""


Once Lulu got a moment, she slipped the potion into the coyote’s water hole it dug into the den. Lulu wartete den richtigen Moment ab und schüttete den Zaubertrank ins Wasser der Kojoten.


The coyote was thirsty saying, “I’m going to wet my lips to prepare for the feast!” Mutter Kojotin war durstig von der Essenszubereitung und sagte:""Ich werde erstmal etwas trinken!""


 Soon she fell asleep and the critters scurried away from the den, making it all the way back to their homes. Es dauerte nicht lange und sie fiel in einen tiefen Schlaf. Die Tiere machten sich schnell davon und liefen nach Hause.


All the children learned a valuable lesson that day. They knew to never go out alone, and to always listen to their parents. All die Tierkinder haben eine wertvolle Lektion an diesem Tag gelernt: niemals allein umherziehen und immer auf die Eltern hören.

Our best and brightest, our leaders and most active members of their fields, teachers, professors, writers, journalists, poets, actors, singers, scientists, entertainers, political and social activists, anybody in a slightly larger house, anybody even close to having some kind of power, etc. It wasn't a simple relocation of random people, it was a heavily analyzed and organized systematic dismantling of a nation. Not to mention the decades of mind-fuck and treatment as second class citizens that followed of course.

They scraped off the top of us and left the remaining mass struggling to reorganize itself. This above all I believe has been the most remarkable part of the recovery post-soviet countries have gone through. Sometimes I wish more people saw the progress when they look and judge our cities and countries.

true,HypnoBufo,null,null,"I studied abroad last year for an entire summer. I noticed that Germans shower less, not in a gross way at all, but they just don't bath as often . Showers and water use was kept to a minimum. A few college age kids I was hanging out with explained that in America we shower every morning due to artificially cheap and plentiful water. Whereas they will just use a washcloth at the sink to get the worst of it taken care of. A friend also taught me about ""Spartan Showering"" which is turning on the shower to get wet, about 10 seconds, then doing all shampoo and body wash without the water on. Then turn it on real quick and get it all off. It was cold and miserable but I would have felt so guilty if my host mother was paying a huge summer water bill for me. 
Also don't expect stores or restaurants to have restrooms. There are public restrooms that are pretty clean depending on where you are. I lived in Charlottenborg, which is a very nice area. However I would drink with some friends at a bar near the public restroom, we saw many, many junkies using it as a hub for deals and shooting up. You pay for a certain amount of minutes to use the restroom, but when the junkies would shoot up they'd pass out and the cops (polizei) would have to come and drag them out. A couple times cops also busted some people gettin' busy. In restaurants waiters would refuse to let boisterous or sketchy patrons use their restroom. This will become very relevant to you soon being that there are no drinking laws in the city, aside from the obvious social norms that would just be weird (i.e church). Regardless it's awesome and you're going to love it! Germans are fun and really caring once you get to know them on a personal level. Make sure to be yourself and be confident. A lot of people will be instantly drawn to talking with you because they hear your accent. These conversations inevitably lead to political talk, no matter how hard you try to avoid it. It will come up and be prepared to actually know what you're talking about, Europeans in general are very articulate and well-versed. One of the professors I studied under in Europe mentioned that a large number of Europeans believe that Americans are superficial and fleeting with their relationships and interactions with others. Smiling is not something that is always perceived as harmless. I'm somebody who will often just smile and laugh when I do something embarrassing in public like I think most Americans are, and this did not always play out well. In closing, I would say Americans and Germans are a lot closer in culture than you'd expect. I had to write a paper when I got back state-side about this exact issue, hence my rambling.

De Grauwe's article in the link describes more aggregate demand as stabilising the system, not just from the core countries but also from investment projects and the European Investment bank. My point was that stabilising the system would help these countries oversee their structural reform. Unemployment in the peripheral countries is already at dangerously high levels, so stabilisation would help create the political capacity for more structural reforms. I'm sorry if I didn't make it clear in my post, I am actually in favour of labour markets in these countries being flexible and in line with their other Eurozone partners.

As for your remarks olive oil and apartments, I'm afraid to say I found them a little patronising. It is important to remember that the export sectors in countries do have industrial bases that would be helped if there was more aggregate demand. Have a look at these tables of exports from [Ireland](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Ireland_Export_Treemap.jpg), [Spain](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Spain_Export_Treemap.png) and [Italy](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Italy_Export_Treemap.jpg) and you'll see pharmaceuticals as well as machinery. In my country anyway, Italian sports cars are still a luxury item that people are willing to pay a lot of money for.

Finally, An unemployment fund wouldn't necessarily entail transfers of wealth from the core to the periphery. If the unemployment fund kicked in when a country's unemployment rate reached 10% for example, then it could potentially assist any Eurozone member state. In Germany, unemployment has been over 10% twice in the last twenty years, so conceivably it would be eligible for assistance if such a fund were put in place.",0,1369209375,null,0,1369211609,0,ca3mfv8,t3_1erzd7,t1_ca3mfv8,t1_ca3lkb4,null,1431074305,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

* summer isn't trying to kill you
* population density, even in the cities, is essentially zero after tokyo
* it's really quiet... the constant announcements about safety that the japanese seem to love to hear are gone, less pointless beeps, no trucks driving around your neighbourhood playing jingles at 8am on a sunday morning...
* people wait for the next subway / bus if it looks full
* germans are terrible at using all the space in a train carriage
* beer is cheap, plentiful, and a thing of beauty
* learning german with a headful of japanese is tricky. give up on one of them...

His looks are due to him being in a horrific car accident. He is french and considered one of the favorites for the 'ball d'or' the trophy for the best player in the world, awarded every year.
In recent years Christiano Ronaldo (Portugal) and Lionel Messi always were the favorites, with Messi winning like 3 years in a row. But since he underperformed this season... chances are people don't just turn to hype and habbit.
