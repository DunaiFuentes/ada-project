true,Rc72,EURO,European Union,"In fact, it isn't entirely correct to state that Spain didn't enter WW2. For a while, it was ""non-belligerent"" rather than neutral.
Apart from that, it certainly wasn't the long-known British bribes that kept Spain from actively joining the Axis. Mostly because those bribes were mostly cashed in by characters that were as unreliable as they were biddable. Above all, however, the main reason Spain didn't more actively join the Axis was that it arranged neither Hitler nor Franco. The one didn't particularly need yet another weak ally with territorial ambitions beyond its station. The other was far too risk-averse to gamble his hard-won rule in another war with an uncertain outcome.

Greek tourism officials also say that Greece is not even close to reaching its potential as a tourist destination and many things are being done to make every year from now on a record tourist season.

2. Privitisation has begun and many international businesses are going to be investing soon. Greece completed a major deal selling 33% of its national lottery last week for 1 billion$ and countries are now interesting in investing heavily in airports/infrastructure projects. Samaras, Greek PM, just finished a week long tour in China to gain investor trust and many CHinese firms are extremely interested in Greece, especialy after the Cosco has had such success with its purchase of a piraeus port which is predicted to create 125,000 jobs by 2018.

3. Organic Food sector has exploded in last year due to world-wide attention of health benefits of Greek yogurt/olive oil and there are about two dozen other organic foods that have as much potential to reach greek yogurt fame. Best thing about Greek food is that it will always be a stable sector . . unlike tech companies that rise and fall, greek organic food will only exponentially grow from now on. Here is a great TED TALK about greek organic food and how it can revolutionize Greece's economy and also public image. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gL3ZqxtW06g

4. Greece is the backbone of the worlds shipping fleet with ownership of around 40% of the entire worlds shipping vessels. IN the last year, 50% of all newly purchased shipping vessels were from Greek companies. 

5. Tech Industry start-ups are booming in Greece due to youth un-employment, an entire generation of young greeks are looking to get into high-tech industry.

6. A Norweigan 50 million$ Natural Gas survey that was completed 2 months ago has concluded that Greece has all the signs for what might be the largest Natural Gas find in recent history witha  potential of minimum of 1 trillion$ to up to or exceeding 5 trillion$.

**This is not specific to the French or France**

I've had my fair share of rude Americans, Brits, Thais, Vietnamese, Russians, Chinese, etc... In no particular order. I'll just add that Brits are particularly harsh with French while many Irish and Scottish consider French as allies against the British (which I always find very surprising).

**Being rude means different things**

I find American people generally more directive than French people and in return most French people  will consider being directive fairly rude (I sure do). Thai people act very differently depending on people's social class and in any situation speech is expected to reflect that.

Try to keep in mind that people are using their own value-system.

Simple words send signals that may be understood differently than they were intended. In other words, without even knowing one may be not giving others the consideration their culture let them expect from any interaction.

**Modern French is not what you might think**

You may be expecting a lot from French people due to your idea of French people. However modern French people don't seem very polite not friendly to me.

**It's a love-hate relationship**

Leaving abroad, speaking another language, living in a different culture is a constant fight.

**Nobody likes foreigners**

Enough said (:

**How I got by**

I had the chance to have a close friend in Thailand who was extremely polite and whose speech reflected that perfectly. She was a radio speaker and was very formal but friendly in the way she spoke. She taught me my first few words and she remained my role-model. As a result other friends I later met always said I was almost too polite but from a foreigner, it was perceived as a mark of respect and indicated I tried hard to speak the language.

When in doubt, smile (in a friendly and inviting way).

**What is specific to French**

I've too noticed that most many French will correct non-native speakers whenever they make mistakes. I'm not entirely sure but I believe those who do are actually trying to be helpful. Indeed, they've got much to learn when it comes to giving people a break.

Edit: Regarding the smile thing. I was remembering a discussion I had with an australian lady who mentionned that French people try to seduce each others all the time when discussing things. To some extent, I believe it's true. Maybe, when you talk to people, you should try to seduce them in a non-sexual way.

true,attttttttttt,Aquitaine,Aquitaine,"I believe I somehow came across as rude since your language is itself is fairly rude. I'll try to clarify a the points you raised.

I'm aware of the historical precedent. I believed it's so long ago that it shouldn't be relevant. To my surprise, it does matter to some people. Now when I meet a Brit, I'm happy to have the opportunity to share things with someone who has a different view and don't base my opinions on our common and sometimes rocky history. I find it hard to believe that a couple of centuries old fights between a bunch of nations could impact today's relations between two individual in such a dramatic way. It's somehow sad and weird.

I believe there's a bit of drama with the French. I truly deplore that. That said, many people still have the expectation that French men, for example, are such romantic and sensitive beings. That time may have never been but surely isn't. French people are simply normal people by any standards. When I moved back to France (which is my home country), I was very saddened to notice how most people are barely respectful to their customers and have no idea of what service actually means. For foreigners, this is the public representation of their host nation and culture; it certainly does reflect poorly in France's case.

I actually value foreigners a lot. I wouldn't have traveled the way I did and put myself into the position of a foreigner if it were otherwise. In the mind of lambda people, it's quite different. While there's a lot of immigration in France and even though their descendants are truly French (to my standards anyway), one can't argue with the fact that having a dark skin and an Arab name makes life much harder (there are figures and studies backing this). As someone who's been a foreigner, I don't envy anyone who currently is one and they are very courageous to remain courteous or even polite. It truly is a difficult thing. This is also not specific to France, the UK and Sweden for example have similar issues as far as I know.

To go further with this sort of idea, we can privilege the dominant language(s) of a certain area. If a group of towns has 80% native English, 10% bilingual English-other, and 10% Hindu, the dot will be red for English. Picturing all the shades of languages would be simply impossible.

Now when I meet a Brit, I'm happy to have the opportunity to share things with someone who has a different view and don't base my opinions on our common and sometimes rocky history. I find it hard to believe that a couple of centuries old fights between a bunch of nations could impact today's relations between two individual in such a dramatic way. It's somehow sad and weird.

Well this is completly out of the debate but yes it is still relevant as the scottish for exemple are still ruled by the Queen of England today even though a part of them at least highly dislikes that fact. So much so actually that a referendum will take place in 2014 to decide whether or not Scotland will remain British. Therefore they do remember the Auld Alliance and such of course. 

Concerning the good old franco-english rivalry it is today more a kind of folklore than anything else and it always ends up at the pub around a good pint of beer. I have been to London quite a lot and I have never experienced any genuine hostility beyond the usual good hearted joke on De Gaulle. It is still definitly in our common culture though and it is nothing sad or weird about it. 

&gt;I was very saddened to notice how most people are barely respectful to their customers and have no idea of what service actually means. For foreigners, this is the public representation of their host nation and culture; it certainly does reflect poorly in France's case.

Depends on a lot of factors, what city you go to, chance is a huge factor as well, knowledge of the ""good"" restaurants etc...

It is common to every country I went. If you go to tourist traps you will be welcomed like you are just a walking wallet and served crap on a plate. The big problem for foreigners is they often do not know the good places from the crappy ones and as a result often end up in a very bad one and then may assume french service is crap. 

To draw from that the conclusion that in France people do not respect their customers is what bugs me, because YOU as a french should know better. Yes, you can have a great service and great food for a good price in France and it is not something rare. 

&gt;While there's a lot of immigration in France and even though their descendants are truly French (to my standards anyway), one can't argue with the fact that having a dark skin and an Arab name makes life much harder (there are figures and studies backing this). 

No one denies that, this is just completly irrelevant, we are not talking about immigration here, we are just talking about someone booking an hotel and having the impression to be treated like shit because the person switched to english.

If you want to go for property, you must look into the understanding of property in german law.
As you may know, Germany and continental Europe in general don't use case law, but rather have laws instituted by our lawmakers directly. Our Judges do have some influence on the development, however it is far lesser than in the States. 
(The difference is this: in the States and UK you go before court and cite another case to argue. In Germany you need to quote an article and build your arguement with / around it. That however is a very short and superficial description of the difference).

If you want to look deeper into our laws, you can find them on: http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/Teilliste_translations.html
(which is the official side of our Ministery of Justice)

In the GG you can find the first hint, what property means in Germany - look at article 14 GG - which basicly says: Property is guaranteed (by law &amp; state). The definition what property is, is being made by our Federal Constitutional Court ( http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/index.html ) &lt;- terrible webdesign btw :-) but an example that in Germany, there is some sort of Case Law to be found.
You probably can find literature on our Constitution in the Library of you collage / law school.

Property goes for the obvious physical things, but also for your thoughts / ideas aka. copyrights (called 'geistiges Eigentum' - 'geistig' in the meaning of 'intelectual' not 'spiritual') (look into the Urheberrecht Gesetz (UrhG) if you wanna know more).
Property also are all asset - Vermögenswerte Rechte - I honestly have no idea how to translate that.... 'asset' is the closest phrase I can come up with. Well, you need to do some work yourself anyway.
Property is never the chance of making money or a persons fortune (wealth) &lt;- this might be the point, where your law of property differentiates from the German.
Property also inclueds the right to conduct commercial operations.

In civil law you need to look into the 'Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB)' our civil code. Look into the articles 903 - 1011.


Well, as for special property issues... copyrights certainly over loads of those. With the most prominent example being 'mein Kampf' by Adolf Hitler. The state Bavaria owns the rights for it. But copyrights on books only last for 70 years after the death of the author. So in 2015 everyone can print 'Mein Kampf' which right now is forbidden by Bavaria. It holds the obvious potential to be leathal, given our past, but since it is Germany, it doesn't seem like they try to find a way to handle it properly, but rather that they try to find a way to hide the book away... I am getting political, sorry.

The Internet holds a lot of problems as well. Germany or rather our music industry has a rather strict approach to Youtube. Many videos containing music aren't accessable due to copyright issues.

If you want to look into the Law of Property in general, I'd recommand to just go for the standard transfer of property.
In that case you can go into the Principle of Abstraction, that elwoody was quoted. It might not exist in the States (As far as I know it is something very specific to German Law. France doesn't use it). To me it isn't very troublesome, but most lay people are confussed by it (many law students as well :-P ). It basicly states, that buying and transfering ownership are to different legal processes.

When they search your house they a) need a warrant b) you have the right to get a witness, the witness has to be a civil servant, but cannot be a police officer, they are not allowed to begin with the search before that (buys time to call your lawyer there) c) they cannot order you to remain at a certain spot, you can move around freely, go to work, etc. d) you sign some papers after, make sure to write ""I object to the search"" on the paper. 

Regardless of what they tell you, the german police does not have the right to summon you. They will send you a letter that sure sounds like you have to face serious consequences if you dont go there, but they actually do not have the right to do so, so you can just ignore it (obviously you should make that decision with your lawyer).

You do not need to give them a DNA sample. Sometimes they make it sound like its standard or you have to, but thats wrong. Fingerprints, yes, DNA, definitely not. You have to sign a written aggreement in order for them to have the right to get a DNA sample. So just say no. Again, you dont need to cooperate, so if they want your DNA, they have to force you, and that would be illegal.

No fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine. Evidence that has been aquired with illegal means can most of the time still be used against you in court.

If they want a testimony from you, and you want to give one, only ever give it to them in written form. It gives you time to think what to write down, and you can even correct yourself, something thats not possible if you give a vocal testimony.",0,1369438598,null,0,false,0,ca5gj13,t3_1ez80f,t1_ca5gj13,t3_1ez80f,null,1431042516,6,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,6

true,adamkex,SWED,Hungarian in disguise,"&gt; Because nothing can have changed in 25 years. Not to mention that is BSS which was like two organizations removed from them even back then.

10 years ago a Sweden Democrat called Sveriges Radio Örebro and said [these](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upXZ1im1leU) kinds of things. As you know this was 7 years before the election and their popularity started to grow long before that. Another one claimed that [Africans are programmed to rape children.](http://www.dn.se/nyheter/valet-2010/sd-politiker-afrikaner-programmerade-att-valdta-barn) Åkesson enjoys singing about Palme's death and his colleges sing [white-power lyrics](http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/rasistiska-sanger-pa-resa-med-sd-ledare_2699389.svd). And it doesn't matter if these people were excluded from the party or not; How often do you hear about these kinds of stories about other parties? Things have changed in 25 years but not as much as many people and especially many of their voters think.

&gt; You mean two party members at one occasion over two years ago armed themselves with iron pipes after supposedly being threatened by organized criminals and one of them acted like a prick while doing so.

&gt; They were subsequently given the option of stepping down from their political posts or getting kicked out and the one who acted like a prick left the party entirely.

Did you watch the video? They were speaking with a drunk guy and a girl as far as I remember. Then they walked away and saw iron pipes and armed themselves with it. At the very end of the video one of them were speaking behind the back of another guy calling him a ""wigger"". If it would have been a mainstream party they would have been kicked out without question. Can you imagine Borg or Ask doing these kinds of things? Ministers have resigned their posts for black labor and what not.

&gt; Oh no! Not like it's true anyway. There's far more aggression and personal attacks coming from the other parties than from SD in parliament and TV debates.

In these 25 years that have passed their most important goal by far is still to reduce immigration. This is how they market themselves. They use terms like ""mass immigration"" and ""responsible immigration policy"". I personally consider this aggressive and it's borderline straw man. When they debate about the amount of immigrants (especially ones whom they dislike) moving to Sweden they use factoids. No wonder why any other party don't want to debate them. What I don't understand is (at least from my experience which may very well be wrong) is why people who vote for the Sweden Democrats are so critical of the current immigration policy but hardly seem to criticize of their own party.",0,1369438813,null,0,false,0,ca5glbl,t3_1ez0qc,t1_ca5glbl,t1_ca5do7f,null,1431042486,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

It's easy to find people who speak English (Irish pubs are always a great start). Don't expect to be able to speak English in every shop, though.

And even if it is, its culture will still be very different due to differences between the US and Germany which shape culture a lot.  Just a few examples...  
You probably went to a high school which was attended by all the kids from the area regardless of socio-financial status or the children's ""potential"" whereas in Germany, there are several different kinds of school forms, and only two of those allow you to continue your studies after graduation at a university/college.  
When you got your driver's license, you probably did it through the school and it was relatively cheap and the test was fairly easy and you did it with an automatic.  In Germany, people have to sign up with private drivers-ed schools, dish out a *ton* of money and go through very long, rigorous training/testing in all kinds of conditions all with a stick-shift.  
In Germany, you could have legally drank at 16.  Maybe your parents allowed you to drink beer at home at 16 or maybe even younger but there's a big difference from that and drinking with friends without adult supervision when you're only 16.  
You've probably never seen a neonazi rally, or the reaction to one from the extreme left and how it can shut an entire city down.  
You may have never rode on a train in your life whereas in Germany, they're completely normal and many people don't even own cars because they can get to everywhere they ever need to be with public transportation.  
State and Religion are not separated in Germany which results in all kinds of differences.  The Bundesländer that are predominately Catholic have a bunch of random holidays all throughout the year so you get many more days off work than you do in the US... You also get way more vacation time in Germany and many Germans travel abroad on vacation, in fact it's the country where the highest percentage of people vacation *outside* of their own country.  
Since you're from a farming community in the American Mid-West, you've probably had very little contact with Muslims but in Germany they are an everyday part of life for every city and many towns, it's also not entirely uncommon to see Muslim families even in some very small villages.  Most immigrants to the US are Latinos who tend to be Catholic if they are religious.  Germany, however, has a *ton* of immigrants from Turkey, North Africa, the Middle East and the Balkans and their culture has somewhat also become part of the German culture.  Turkish food is more popular in Germany than Mexican food is in the US.  
All of these minor differences add up to make you something that is not ""German"".

Es werden auch immer wieder Konversationsfäden gestartet, in denen diese Haltungen (inner- und außerhalb Reddits) diskutiert werden.

I like Armenians, feel more culturally close to them then I do to Western/Northern Europe, Turkic countries in Central Asia or the Muslim Middle East, appreciate their cultural and architectural contributions to the land I was born in, [love their music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2pOawXOcFM), and appreciate their (tragically dwindled) presence in my country. I feel like there is a lot of reciprocity of these feelings with Turkish-Armenians, but can't say the same about the diaspora from what I've seen (in Montreal, specifically).

Yes, I think an ethnic cleansing happened in Anatolia targeting Armenians, whatever name you are going to give it is semantics. If, as the victims, you perceive it as genocide, I'll respect that. I don't care what it's called - most debate is over semantics that takes the emphasis off the actual tragedy of more than a million lives lost and many more forced off of their homeland.

What annoys me to no end are the assumptions that come from me being Turkish. I'm not involved in any personal way in any historical or current event that hurt an Armenian individual or group. I haven't cast a single vote for a politician that denies the genocide and make an active effort to argue for and protect minority rights in my country. And I shouldn't have to make this declaration every time I identify as a Turk. I'm constantly expected to feel guilt for something that I'm not in any way involved in. I have all the sympathy in the world for the victims of genocide as well as the Armenians who persist in living on their homeland despite the history and hostile nationalist minorities. But as I saw someone saying in some other thread yesterday, this is starting to become worthy of having a Godwin's Law all of its own. Every single conversation about anything Turkish takes about a comment or two before the genocide comes up. Not every Turk denies the genocide, it's rarely relevant, and every time someone invokes it irrelevantly, it takes away from meaningful conversations both on the genocide and the original subject at hand. I'm only a couple genocide interrogations away from acting like the troll people expect me to be.

The beer industry is indeed heavily regulated (just as it is in the US), and some of the laws we have today were influenced by the legacy left by the Reinheitsgebot. Any type of beer can be produced, including Belgian styles and some particularly interesting varietals in the north made with apples and cheeries (although, for legal reasons these are still not able to be labelled ""beer"" and therefore are taxed differently). Other ingredients are now allowed which were previously banned. For example, wheat is now allowed to be used as an ingredient in making beer. The production of Hefeweizen was technically illegal for a long time. Be aware though, that Hefeweizen brewers who claim compliance with the Reinheitsgebot of 1487 (or 1516) are spruiking nonsense. The 1487 and 1516 laws strictly forbid the use of wheat. You mentioned that yeast is part of the Reinheitsgebot. It is not. Yeast is implicitly forbidden under the law, because at the time of the laws' writing this micro-organism had not been discovered!

In general, I do agree with you. Wearing a Reinheitsgebot as a badge of honour really grinds my gears.

true,banana-tree,TURK,Turkey,"I'm just saying, some of the people that get pestered about this (online, anyway, and certainly not only by Armenians) are pretty much the only allies you have to change the stance of the government in the first place. As for the rest who actually deny the genocide, pestering them about it in every venue regardless of relevance only serves to reinforce their prejudice that will prevent them to look beyond the official history they've been taught. 

The government's stance is very much dependent on internal politics*, but also foreign policy. I remember some tentative attempts at opening the border with Armenia immediately hurt our relationships with Azerbaijan for a good while. And if it comes down to a pick between Azerbaijan and Armenia (and it will, until the two countries fix their own relationships), the choice for Turkey is obvious. Not just because of ethnicity (that does play a role), but because Armenia doesn't have much power of its own as it is, beyond international lobbies and support. Azerbaijan has oil and gas. Sadly, that's pretty much all that matters down the line. So it's not just a matter of stubbornness and semantics on the governmental level and that's harder to fix than the individual level.

*: I was going to say that this is one of the few governments that has been able to get away with acts that go against the status quo of nationalism (esp. the latest developments with the Kurds), so it might be a good opportunity to press for further action in that direction. But then again, they're doing what they're doing with a strong Islamic flavour and using that as the common ground  and it's from both sides too; the Kurdish leader Ocalan slipped several strong statements blaming Armenians, Jews and the Greek for lobbying against Turkey in the US and pitting Muslim Turks against Muslim Kurds for their own benefit. [Those statements](http://www.bianet.org/bianet/siyaset/144737-imrali-gorusmesi-tutanagi#.US9g5WADErA.twitter) (in Turkish, but ctrl+f for ""Ermeni"" and google-translate relevant parts if you want) slipped by the Western media for whatever reason, but the current new status quo in Turkey is moving from nationalism to an Islam-centered alliance, so that's not likely to benefit Armenians any more than the previous state.

true,Eilinen,FINL,Finland,"&gt;Southern finland is not that swedish-heavy

It is. Kirkkonummi and the area west of it is is and Sipoo and the area of it east is. That Espoo, Vantaa and Helsinki aren't is due to immigration starting late 50s from the Finnish-speaking provinces due to urbanisation and growing of the capital. When my mother was born in Esbo back in late 40s there wasn't a Finnish priest to be found in the whole town. And the Swedish one refused to to baptise in Finnish nor give a Finnish name to a child. 

That Kirkkonummi and Sipoo are two-language counties is a change that happened very recently -- within ten years, I think. Same goes for Kauniainen. Speaking Swedish is still the default in these places. 

These maps are almost never up to date by even a decade. 

On the other hand, Karelian isthmus is marked Finnish even though it's virtually impossible to find anybody speaking Karelian nor Finnish on the area due to first everybody leaving the area after the Wars and then later Stalin's one-way tickets to Siberia. The area is Russian-speaking these days (the areas north of isthmus aren't, but that's another story).

There would be an argument for not including most of the territory of Georgia and Azerbaijan and excluding Armenia and certainly Cyprus entirely as being in Asia if you wanted to be consistent, but the precise borders of Europe in that area are not clearly defined; ""Europe"" as a continent is at the end of the day entirely based on convention, not geography. If taking a purely geographical approach, a single continent of Eurasia is the only thing that really makes sense.

But whatever about those countries absolutely everyone is in agreement that Thrace is in Europe and Anatolia is in Asia.

Je pense que faire de l'information la priorité dans un monde où les NTIC sont déjà omniprésentes est un peu redondant. L'information est là, elle est accessible, avec les sites encyclopédiques coopératifs comme wikipedia, les MOOC pour rattraper des lacunes et progresser dans des domaines jusqu'à un niveau de début d'université. La science elle-même ( de façon simplifiée on va pas commencer à parler des paywalls universitaires et du coût des équipements ) est quasiment gratuite. Le mauvais procès qui me semble être fait aux revues de vulgarisation ( qui comme toute la presse écrite va être amenée à disparaître en majorité ) est de tenter de faire croire que les gens y cherchent une information juste, sans biais éditorial et rigoureusement établie alors que c'est bien l'inverse. La science est quelque chose de très aride, de très laborieux au jour le jour, et que le travail des vulgarisateurs ( qui sont bien souvent de formation scientifique voire parfois de très grand noms ) est de réenchanter le domaine scientifique et de vendre une vision du monde voire de sous-tendre un projet politique. 

&gt;D'où mon intérêt pour la didactique.

En dehors du projet de la thèse, d'ailleurs émaillée d'avis tranchés et un peu trop chargés pour remplir des critères d'objectivité, je pense que ce retour permanent du mot didactique a tout pour me chagriner. C'est ce qui discrédite irrémédiablement le document car il propose de remplacer des publications de prêt-à-penser pseudo-scientifique comme il l'appelle et le remplace par du même prêt-à-penser mais rhétorique cette fois qui ne permet pas plus de se faire une opinion puisqu'il ne reste plus rien à l'issue de son application. Prendre un magnifique vêtement et le détricoter systématiquement sans réfléchir n'est pas le meilleur moyen de comprendre sa confection et de tirer quoique ce soit de son étude. Que les mots aient des limites et qu'il soit faisable de les tordre dans tous les sens pour dire tout et son contraire c'est connu depuis l'Antiquité, avoir des arguments spécifiques, correctifs et constructifs à l'égard de chacun des prétendus sophismes qui parsèment les oeuvres de vulgarisation est une démarche de décence et de respect qui n'apparaissent nulle part dans cette débauche de ""fautes didactiques"".

&gt;Je considère surtout qu'être détenteur d'un savoir, c'est aussi être, au moins en partie, responsable de sa transmission. 

Oui et non, votre propos laisse à penser qu'il y aurait des gens qui accapareraient le savoir scientifique en rejetant les profanes alors que ce n'est pas vraiment le cas, les chercheurs ne le restent que parce qu'ils font des découvertes qu'ils arrivent à partager et plus elles sont partagées et leur impact est grand, plus le chercheur est reconnu. Il y a bien quelque cas de savoirs ""protégés"" comme les secrets d'Etat ou les secrets industriels mais la logique est différente. De plus, je pense qu'un droit à l'information est un droit qui doit s'exercer par quiconque en fait la démarche, comme le droit à la formation, et non un phénomène subi où les victimes seraient et celui qui devient forcé d'informer et celui qui se voit imposer une information qui ne l'intéresse pas.

Cela dépend de ce que vous voulez savoir, dans quel domaine et si l'information doit être scientifique ou pas.

For example: In classic german CV the order in which you mention your former employments is from first done - first listed to last done - first listed (as in american/british CV).
It still is usual in Germany though to put a picture of yourself on the CV, although more and more companies don't want that in order to not be told they are sorting out different ethnitc groups or the like. Be sure to have your CV and the acompanied paper and copies all very tidy, free of typing-errors and so on. Germans are really, really picky about that. If you can't get it right in something so important as in your ""Bewerbung"", we assume, you are working sloppy all the time.
In Germany there is also the DIN-Norm (a norm for about everything). For letters the norm differs from american papers. Especially dates are written diffrently (day.month.year, not month-day-year). Those are the little things. They perhaps won't be a big deal, but those small things will show, that you are adapting to german standards already.
If you have succesfully studied, my guess would be: Try to use that and get a job in that area. If you are working in a low-paid-job for a longer time, it will become more and more difficult to get out of that area when time passes by. Try international companies perhaps. They sometimes even have english as company-language (i. e. some parts of IBM Germany often speak english as ""official language).
If you are really willing to do whatever comes, you have to possibility of working in Zeitarbeit / Arbeitnehmerüberlassung (temporary work), but be aware that those are most time really, really bad (trust me, I've been on the hiring side of the office-table for several years).

Can't help about Visa, sorry.

Another thing just on the side: I've known a few american/german couples, and while it sure can work out great (und ich drücke Dir die Daumen), a significant part of them got into fights, once the fancy ""I miss you so much""-phase was over, because they saw each eather every day. That's nothing to do with american/german, but with ""only seeing each other on weekends"". So my tip: Keep the romance alive! And try to get on your own feet. It would be important, that you would like to live in Germany, wether your girlfriend lives here or not. Build up your own live, so that you're not only living with her and her parents. Make friends of your own (Germans are pretty nice after all, despite other implications ;) ).

Viel Erfolg!

Well, I can say that you need to include a photo of yourself (not always necessary - it depends) and that you need certificates/documents from school or previous jobs (about your degrees) or so. And everything needs to be in some sort of a folder.

Yeah, she told me to put a picture of me on it and I found that odd but went with it anyway. So basically, I have to list my employment or achievements from oldest to most recent, correct?

I'll see if I can follow what I've done but not speaking fluent German will probably work against me here.

I noticed this as well. We both have been in long term relationships but she hasn't ever lived with anyone, whereas I have. Adjusting to seeing someone everyday is easier for me than it is for her and I know it's going to be an adjustment. It's not that we got into fights, truth is we've only been in one fight ever and it's because I broke a cardinal rule - never leave your girlfriend by herself on the street after a club in Deutschland. But I see where you're coming from. All we have is communication because of the distance and we work *very* hard at keeping things open, honest, and alive.

Solid advice on creating my life out there for myself, in addition to making it with her. It has been my experience that German people are a lot more open and friendly than people made them out to be. I haven't had a single bad experience.

true,amicocinghiale,italy,,"Che bisogni lavorare per non pensare è una conclusione tutta tua e tienitela per te. Bisogna lavorare PER mangiare, avere un posto dove dormire, e poi per il resto. Io non trovo invece l'evoluzione una cosa contronatura, piuttosto la vedo in un altro modo: prima si era in uno stato di natura, dove a prevalere erano gli individui più dotati in forza fisica, non solo fra di loro ma in generale, il più bravo a correre non finiva mangiato, il più bravo a rincorrere era quello che mangiava, ecc.

Con l'evoluzione della civilità, il prerequisito per ottenere il titolo di ""più adatto all'ambiente circostante"" è passato dall'essere (volendo semplificare ovviamente) il più forte fisicamente ad essere il più forte mentalmente, e in molteplici sensi: ora più che mai, è il più intelligente che *ha più possibilità* di sopravvivenza, vuoi grazie alla sua conoscenza conseguita da studio, vuoi dalla sua capacità di truffa, che non è che un'altra forma di intelligenza (eticamente deprorevole però, ma ora l'etica e la morale non ci interessa nel discorso), tutte capacità che servono a sopravvivere nella nostra civiltà così complessa: i più deboli mentalmente sono i depressi, gli inadatti, i misfits, che appunto non reggono questo ritmo e si lasciano sopraffare dall'esterno. Un depresso nella società è un equivalente di una persona senza una gamba o un'occhio nella giungla. Non è colpa sua, ha bisogno di aiuto, ma è comunque un debole. La frase ""smartness is the new sexy"" continene molto più di uno slogan pro-nerds, è la nuova verità, e il nuovo metro di paragone per giudicare la capacità di adattamento di qualcuno. Ovviamente se tornassimo a uno stato di natura i ruoli si invertirebbero di nuovo.

Quindi mi fai ridere quando difendi il tuo romanticissimo popolo di cacciatori, sei rigido e fossilizzato nella visione nostalgica di uno stato di natura quando non ti accorgi che da uno stato di natura in un certo senso non siamo mai usciti (e mai usciremo, non è pessimismo, è realismo), sono ""solo"" cambiati i requisiti di sopravvivenza. Tu dici che prima erano felici, certo, erano felici quelli in grado di scappare più veloce e di menare più forte, gli altri erano già morti. Tu dici che ora non siamo felici, certo, non sono felici quelli che non sono in grado di reggere mentalmente la vita attuale, chi ha successo nella vita ora è felice.

Una piccola nota a margine: ovviamente non intendo dipingere uno scenario freddamente logico e binario. OVVIAMENTE ora se un ingegnere o un finanziere venisse preso a cazzotti da un energumeno (in linea di massima) la sua intelligenza non servirebbe a nulla. Parimenti, se un magrolino selvaggio fosse abbastanza furbo da creare una trappola per difendersi dagli altri più forti non soccomberebbe. Ma come tu puoi vedere, in qualsiasi gradino della scala tecnologica l'uomo di trovi, questo tende sempre, nel lungo periodo, a salirla questa cazzo di scala. Quindi, per favore, smettila con queste teorie ridicole sul ridere riposare e giocare.

edit: ho dimenticato di citare i suicidi. Continuando il paragone di cui sopra, i suicidi sono quelli troppo lenti mentalmente a scappare dal leone della foresta odierna. Chiamala selezione naturale, se vuoi. E attenzione, il suicida non è uno stupido, nel senso non intelligente, è una persona mentalmente debole nel senso che non sopporta la pressione del mondo.

Es scheint auch so zu sein dass die rassistischen Kommentare zumindest teilweise koordiniert sind. Als das Problem gerade erst am heranwachsen war wurde mal ein Link zu einem Subreddit gepostet der explizit den Zweck hatte das zu organisieren, woraufhin dieser auf privat geschaltet wurde. Dort ging es nicht um dummes Trollen, sondern tatsächlich um relativ professionelle Propagandatechniken. Gelegentlich kann man auch heute noch beobachten wie derartige Submissions und Kommentare erst hoch- und dann von der Community heruntergevotet werden. Der grösste Teil der Kommentare kommt auch von Redditors die sonst nicht auf /r/Europe kommentieren. Das ist also, zumindest teilweise, gezielte Manipulation.  
In /r/Europe haben die Moderatoren das Problem mittlerweile erkannt und löschen zumindest die extremeren relativ schnell, und die Situation hat sich meiner Ansicht nach schon deutlich gebessert. Gegen subtilere Techniken  (z.B. Agenda Setting) vorzugehen ist allerdings fast nicht möglich ohne einzelne Themenkomplexe generell zu Zensieren. Themen wie Zuwanderung und Integration sind an sich legitim, so lange die Berichterstattung objektiv ist, erst die Dosis macht das Gift. Aber auch das ist etwas dessen sich die Moderatoren bewusst sind.

Dass /r/de auf Deutsch ist bietet zumindest gegen derartige koordinierte Angriffe einen gewissen Schutz. Umgekehrt hilf es auch dass Reddit größtenteils auf Englisch ist, da das zumindest für die dümmsten Rassisten doch eine Schwierigkeit darstellt.

sex     
sju      
åtta     
nio      
tio    

That sounds familiar, doesn't it?

To prove I'm not making this up - Hungarian and Finnish are in the same group. I can't understand Finnish at all, it's like Chinese to me, but if you look at the numbers:

| | *Hungarian* | *Finnish* |
|:--|-------------|----------:|
|1 | egy | yksi |
|2 | kettő  | kaksi |
| 3 | három | kolme |
| 4 | négy | neljä |
| 5 | öt | viisi |
| 6 | hat | kuusi |
| 7 | hét | seitsemän |
| 8 | nyolc | kahdeksan |
| 9 | kilenc | yhdeksän |

If you take into consideration the h -&gt; k change which appears in other words as well, then you can see that 1,2,3,4,6 are the same. In Hungarian 7-9 are of unknown origin. So there's a 50% match between languages that can't understand each other.

Or check this out:

| | *German* | *Iranian* |
|:--|----------|---------:|
| 1  |  ein  | yek  |
| 2  |  zwei  | du  |
| 3  |  drei  | se  |
| 4  |  vier  | chvar  |
| 5  |  fünf  | penj  |
| 6  |  sechs  | shesh  |
| 7  |  sieben  | heft  |
| 8  |  acht  | hesht  |
| 9  |  neun  |  neh |

1,2,4,6,8,9 are kind-of the same. A 50-60% match.

And now let's see Turkish and Mongolian:

| | *Mongolian* | *Turkish* |
|:--|-----------|----------:|
| 1 | neg |	bir |
| 2 | khoyor |	iki |
| 3 | gurav |	üç |
| 4 | dorov |	dört |
| 5 | tav |	beş |
| 6 | zurgaa |	altı |
| 7 | doloo |	yedi |
| 8 | naim |	sekiz |
| 9 | es |	dokuz |
| 10 | arav |	on |

Only dorov is similar to dört, so it's a 10% match.

I'm not a linguist but there are other such tests which all fail in the case of Mongolian and Turkish. As others have said, the theory that they're the same group came from the racist 19th century when saying ""they came from the same place"" was counted as a valid proof. Korean for example also comes from that same place, and is recognized as a language isolate not related to either Chinese or Mongolian. How can people accept that Korean is different from Mongolian but can't accept the same for Turkish?

I've talked to an Uyghur guy (Turkic minority in China) who says he can understand Turkey-Turkish but Mongolian not at all. One reason why some scholars confuse Uyghurs with Mongols is that the Mongolians conquered the territory where the Uyghurs lived and they took over the Uyghur alphabet, so that when Europeans look at an Uyghur or Mongol book they think it's the same thing. Kind of like how many people think Persian and Arabic are the same.

you'd basically sell your right to get those 1600 € to someone, you'd have whatever the person is willing to pay you for that and he'd have to go through those legal procedures.  **BUT** you'd have to find someone willing to do this and i don't know how exactly this will be handled in court etc.)

L'objection ""Esclavagiste-phallocrate"" est vraiment classique:

&gt;Autre objection fréquente : on nous rappelle aimablement, comme si nous l'ignorions, que les Athéniens étaient esclavagistes, phallocrates, et xénophobes. 
 Effectivement, à l'époque, les femmes ne faisaient pas partie du peuple, les esclaves non plus, et les étrangers non plus. Mais juger ces faits antiques avec les valeurs d'aujourd'hui est un anachronisme, une injustice, une absurdité ; c'est aussi idiot que de reprocher aux Athéniens de ne pas voler en avion… (L'image est de Jacqueline de Romilly).
 Quand on s'intéresse aux institutions athéniennes, on ne défend pas l'esclavagisme, ni la misogynie, ni la xénophobie, évidemment… Simplement, on a le sens du discernement, on sépare le bon grain de l'ivraie, on n'est pas bêtement manichéen : la démocratie ne fonctionnait PAS grâce à l'esclavagisme, NI grâce à la phallocratie, NI grâce à la xénophobie. 
 Autrement dit, débarrassées de ces caractères infamants, les institutions athéniennes auraient produit les mêmes résultats bénéfiques en termes d’égalité politique et de protection contre les oligarques. 
 Autrement dit, cette objection malhonnête consiste à monter en épingle (exagérer l’importance) de caractères sans aucun rapport avec le sujet central de la démocratie : comment organiser la Cité pour qu’aucun corps n’opprime les autres ? Il ne faut pas se laisser distraire et détourner de l’essentiel, et voir comment le peuple de l’époque, défini comme il pouvait l’être à l’époque, AVEC SES RICHES ET SES PAUVRES (CECI EST ESSENTIEL), voir comment ce peuple s’est protégé contre les oligarques, contre la tendance des riches à tout prendre pour eux, toujours plus. Comme dit Castoriadis, Athènes n'est pas un modèle mais un germe.

For that ""rape capital thing"", see [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19592372), for example. Quote: ""*This was three times higher than the number of cases in the same year in Sweden's next-door neighbour, Norway, and twice the rate in the United States and the UK. It was more than 30 times the number in India, which recorded about two offences per 100,000 people.*""

So maybe it's not as simple as comparing numbers?

Same goes for violent crime. There is a rise. To see what that means, you have to account for different definitions of that crime and for a rise in the percentage *reported* crime. 

The easiest way to do that is usally to have a look at victim surveys. They are not perfect, but they help. I don't speak Swedish, which makes all of this a little difficult, but here:[PDF, page 17](http://www.bra.se/download/18.22a7170813a0d141d21800059173/2012_English_summary_NTU_2011.pdf)

That seems to indicate that pretty much all crime is fairly stagnant, and that the strong rise in reported crime does not mean the actual crime is rising at all or at least by as much. It's all not so simple. But again, I'm not Swedish, so sources are a bit difficult.

I actually thought Church could be reformed thanks to that - nobody bothered with stupid shit like premaritial sex or anticonception, it was all about being honest and not selling others.

Also being a priest wasn't as easy career like it is now, people that wanted to have easy life without working were better off signing up to the party.

The the communism ended, and Church become one of the biggest players in the struggle for power. All the worst scum surfaced. Priests started driving mercedeses even in the pooorest villages. State did shaddy deals with church (selling land cheaply most often).

This again? I though this had already been covered. This has absolutely nothing to do with the actual amount of rapes, it has to do with the number of convicted rapists. In many countries rapes are rarely reported because of shame and low chance of conviction. Also in Sweden we have a higher number of different degrees of rape than most (any?) other countries, where something that would elsewhere be labeled as mere ""harassment"" is reported as ""rape"" in Sweden.

I myself is a second generation immigrant from Croatia and I, like my father and brother before me, is finishing my Master of Science in Engineering degree in a few weeks. 

As always the problem with immigrants is not the fact that they come from different countries, but that our integration policies are horrible. A native Swede would behave no better if put in the same situation as these people. The common denominator with basically all criminals is not that they come from a different country, it is that they are poor and desperate, native Swede or not.

Sadly while the absolute majority of immigrants are integrated perfectly in our society, way too many are in fact poor and desperate, much because they have practically received the worst education Sweden has to offer.
Our society has welcomed them with open arms, only to cast them aside in ghettos when they arrive.

Yes, this is a problem that we need to take care of, but throwing people back to their war torn countries where they will likely face their painful demise merely because we can't properly take care of a few rotten eggs is simply not a solution.

First of all it wasnt a hysteria among ""muslims"" in France. It was a hysteria in the poor Banlieus where people of all religions and ethnicites rioted. You think the rich muslims living in the 7eme arrondisement burnt cars? No, it was riots by the poor people.

And there were reasons for these actions. Whether we accept them or dont (personally I am very against violence to express yourself), the people in the banlieus have faced alot of issues for decades and their situation has only gotten worse. Banlieus people dont have a voice, they have no politician representing them, they are unimportant economically, they are geographically displaced from the rest of the population etc, and their problems are not answered and they have no voice. 

Plus added to that they are very heavily policed (for understandable reasons), but its frustrating when you are strip searched each time you leave your house, and the police is rude and beat them and occasionaly people die under police custudy in jail. 

There is alot of built up anger, and when someone is killed- it is the boiling point where they express all their frustrations and also- the only time when the rest of the population actually realize they exist.

The one spokesmen for banlieus in France are rappers, and they are the only ones who say the situation over there and how it is only getting worse due to unemployment and de-industrialisation. 

Here is the lyrics of Foutre le feu by NTM in 1995- so we can actually here the banlieus express themselves. NTM are made of Kool Shen (of Portuguese descent) and Joey Starr (of Carribean descent). Neither are muslims or necessarily care of religion at all. They are the most influential French rap group, and possibly most influential non-American in the world.

&gt; More concrete therefore even less space

&gt; that is vital and necessary for wellbeing of men

&gt; No, no one is in chaines, but its like

&gt; telling us that France is advancing whereas she tinks

&gt; that with repression she can stop completely delinquency

&gt; Please, a bit of good sense

&gt; ""Hitting"" will not solve the state of urgency

&gt; Which makes me ask

&gt; How long will all of this last

&gt; Its already been years that everything should have ""exploded""

&gt; Unfortunately, unity was not on our side

&gt; But you know things will end badly

&gt; The war of world, you wanted it, you will have

&gt; But what are we waiting to set fire to the place?

&gt; But what are we waiting to no longer follow the rules of the game?

&gt; I am only living opressed

&gt; Like the society wants it, this is a fact

&gt; But its time for this to stop, that joy can come

&gt; So that our youth with a vengeful hand

&gt; Burns the state, police first and

&gt; Sends the republic to the butcher

&gt; Our turn has arrived, lets roll the dice

&gt; Decide to mentally equip ourselves

&gt; What? You're blind? you dont see? You pretend? You cant hear me? 

&gt; I think rather, that you have not given yourself the choice

&gt; Alot are already in this situation

&gt; Which is why this will end in dissaray

&gt; Dissaray is already ruling, the rural world is the example

&gt; Dissaray is aready ruling, you will follow the same drop, slow agony

&gt; Thats why I am speaking to these fucking incompetent politicians

&gt; Who have lowered France

&gt; So the time now is not for mediation

&gt; But for facts, with fire, which in my eyes seems to be the best way

&gt; For us to be taken a little more seriously

&gt; From now on the streets dont forgive anymore

&gt; We have nothing to lose as we have never had anything

&gt; At your place, I would not sleep peacefully

&gt; The Bourgeoisie can tremble, the ghetto people are in the city

&gt; Not to party, but to set fire

&gt; Lets go to the Elysee and burn the old men

&gt; And old women, afterall one day they will have to pay

&gt; The psycopath which is sleeping in me is waking up

&gt; Where are our references?

&gt; Who are our models?

&gt; You have burnt the wings of a whole youth

&gt; Destroyed their dreams, dried up the seed of hope

&gt; Oh, when I think about it

&gt; Its time for us to think about it, its time for France

&gt; to finally take conscience of all its damages

&gt; To make lessons of its shameful actions

&gt; But how much? The glass is full

&gt; History teaches it, our chances are small

&gt; Therefore lets stop everything, instead of letting this continue

&gt; Or drain us, even more hate

&gt; Lets unite to burn this system!

Not in Norrland, old ""bruksorter"" etc - so that excuse does not work.


&gt;A LOT of people are unemployed, meanwhile, society is working fine

&gt;that affects self esteem, it creates an impression that they aren't needed or wanted by society and are just put away in suburbs to live their lives there

Same thing with Norrlands inland, old bruksorter etc.

Honestly you seem to be claiming a lot of different things - none of them backed up by any facts, unfortunately. 

Make up your mind - if you are going to blame it on umployment you will also have to explain why there aren't riots in inre Norrland and every single old bruksort in Sweden. Otherwise - your explanations doesn't hold. 

Also,you are obviously ignoring the fact that one have a personal responsibility and these people are assholes and idiots.

true,ravenren,POLA,Polan the Stronkest,"&gt;I'm not saying all Poles are like that, mate. I'm talking about Poland as an entity, regarding its institutions, the same way I do about Spain and its fascist ones that still remain today. For instance, I freaked out when I learned abortion was illegal there. I mean, come on!

oh, yes,  I actually talk about it [a few posts higher](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ezkq1/poland_a_dark_side_of_the_catholic_church/ca5nobg).

&gt;Although the majority of them called themselves catholics. Atheism is somewhat rare there. Therefore, in the same way, people freaked out when I told them I hadn't been baptized.

I would call myself a Catholic because I was baptised and didn't officially perform an act of apostasy, and foremost because that's the tradition that's the closest to me. I celebrate Christmas, I sing carols, I celebrate Easter, if someone wanted me to pray for them - it would be a Catholic prayer, because that's what I know. 

**But** I would call myself an agnostic because that's what I believe, I wouldn't get married in church, I don't go to church. And I think that this is why pure atheism is rare, but still not as much as you think. 

People here have a hard time dividing religion from tradition. For centuries being Polish was being Catholic - the time of foreign occupations - the Germans were Prostestant, the Russians were Orthodox - Catholicism is something what had us united since 18th century till the fall of communism. You can't get a rid of it that quickly. But it still happens really fast.

As for the freaking out because of baptism - I can't help you here - my own brother hasn't had his children baptised and I never gave it another thought.


&gt;It's very true what they say about Poland A and Poland B.

Yes, there is that. It's also true for youngsters/elderly, cities/countryside, higher education/lack thereof - but this trend is present everywhere.

Since you're obviously a right-wing nutter from another country, who doesn't know anything about Sweden, I'll link you the English article about the gang ""OG""[1] . Founded by Assyrians and now consisting of all kinds of ethnicities and religions. And these are really bad people. They do worse stuff than burning cars.

According to your link the gang was formed by an Assyrian. That's it, the rest of the members are Europeans and immigrants. Calling it Assyrian is a joke. Its members don't go around killing people in the name of Syriac Orthodoxy, idiot, that's the difference aside from the fact that's far more heterogeneous then your riot gangs which are 95-99% Muslim.

&gt;Swedish youth gangs, the type you lot in other countries like to write about, consist of all types of people, as I've said. You're firmer assertion does not make you're claims true, and the onus is on you to prove them.

But you can agree they're 99% Muslim, right? Or are delusional?

&gt; use the expression ""Allahu Akbar"" as well. Even though they are Christians.

Bull fucking shit. ""Allahu Akbar"" is exclusively a Muslim term.

&gt;But all this is beside the point. Youth gangs in Sweden are not the religious extremists. We have religious extremists, and a fare share of Muslim ones. Those are, however, not the ones burning cars. They do other things, of which I do not approve.

I agree that the ones burning are not all necesarily the bearded white robes type but that's who gives them their inspiration. They teach them to hate Swedes, treat Swedish girls as inferior sluts, etc.

&gt;I would never have the stomach to compare genocides to win an argument over you on the internet. Why are you so obsessed with spreading lies about Muslims? Why are you trying to make up a conflict? You are spreading hatred, and I hope, for the sake of humanity, that you change your ways.

Answer this genius, who is more in danger in the MENA, a Muslim or a Christian?

Holy fuck if your type represents even 10% of Swedes then I can imagine why your country went from a haven to a shithole with one of the highest rape rates in the world.

However, you still have to look at what actually creates this kind people. Remember, many if not most of the hooligans are second generation immigrants and have very few connections to their parents originating country.

I simply refuse to believe that the majority of immigrants are simply leeching on the society, merely because they don't want to contribute. That kind of people do very well exist, but I want to believe they are in the absolute minority. It simply isn't as easy to just ""get a job"" and work yourself out of poverty. I know people (native Swedes mind you) with Master's degrees in chemistry and biotechnology with literally perfect grades who are working their arses off to merely get a job. A friend of our family who fled the war in Bosnia who had a Master's degree in economics and had previously worked at one of the largest banks in Bosnia, had to work as a cleaning lady in Sweden.

These are highly educated, hard working people who wants nothing less than to contribute to our society and their families. Yes, many do succeed eventually, but the amount of work required for that to happen far exceeds that of a native Swede born in a relatively good neighbourhood.

Now think about the people who doesn't have a proper education, doesn't speak the language at all and in worst case scenario might not even be able to write or read properly in any language. Now, instead of actually taking care of these people, giving them sufficient education and some way to contribute to society, we lump them together and put them in suburbs where no native Swedes want to live and the only people they meet are other immigrants. What are they supposed to do? Who is going to employ them? How are they going to get educated when no Swedish teachers want to work there? How are they supposed to successfully integrate in our society when they are never actually exposed to our culture?

In the end, they don't get any proper jobs because there aren't any and they can't move because they don't have any money or knowledge about the country. All they see is how ""they"" are ignored by the society (for many, the only society they know) and since human nature as always works as clockwork and they desperately need someone to blame for their situation, we as a society effectively becomes the enemy.

The police are allowed to collect fines (Verwarnungsgeld) for most minor traffic offenses on the spot.  If you don't have enough cash on hand, you can usually pay with a credit/debit card.  If you are unable or unwilling to pay (you have the legal right to do so), your vehicle may be impounded (at additional cost to you, of course), although in most cases you'll probably just be issued a citation to appear in court later.  Note that if you refuse to pay the spot fine, you may be assessed a higher fine when you go to court, and some fines are based on your income.  You need not fear when paying spot fines-- the German police are very professional and corruption is very rare, and you will always be given a receipt for the payment.

Some traffic violations are considered to be felonies and may be punishable by imprisonment if lives or property are endangered.  These include driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, leaving the scene of an accident, illegal passing, U-turns and wrong-way driving or backing-up on the Autobahn, failure to yield the right-of-way, and reckless driving including excessive speeding.

Germany operates a point system for driving offenses.  Most minor violations accrue one to four points, with more serious violations earning five or more points.  Points for minor offenses are expunged after three years; other offenses will remain on the record for five to 10 years depending on the offense.  Motorists who exceed four points on their record at any given time can attend a driving safety class to eliminate four points from their record (two points if the total is greater than nine.)  Those who accumulate 14 points are required to attend the safety class.  They may then voluntarily obtain counseling from a traffic psychologist to eliminate two points from their record.  Anyone who accumulates 18 or more points will have their license suspended indefinitely.  The US military also has a point system that varies somewhat from the German system.

It is more complex than that. Lee Rigby was a soldier, a willing participant in an endless war against the terrorism. He was not a civilian, he was according to the international law (greatly ""redefined"" after 9/11) a combatant. Therefore he was a legitimate target. All our soldiers &amp; military installations are legitimate targets. 

The whole mess is a fine example of our hypocrisy: our soldiers are/were killing people in Iraq, Afghanistan... our drones regularly kill people in Pakistan (international law violations in every way imaginable). But when the other side strikes back at legitimitate targets - soldiers! - we cry foul. No, it is not. He was part of a machine that is waging a war at the other end of the world.  

This does not mean, that I agree with Anjem Choudary. He is repulsive &amp; attention whore. But we have to put things in the right perspective.

Commissionaires are politicians, they are not specialist of EU legislation. EU employees people, bureaucrats, who are specialized on on European public administration and legislation. In case where we have a politician against a bureaucrat, then I would put my bets that the bureaucrat is right about the issue, especially if it concern is something legal or allowed.

&gt; Also, ""EU taxpayers"" includes all EU taxpayers.

And other EU taxpayers, if you are one, should also be vigilant on usage of money. When you are start bending and breaking rules on usage of money you soon end up to a Greek situation where the state virtually ungovernable. If there is a need to use money in a way that breaks current legislation then what is needed is new legislation, not bending and breaking, that will only lead to long term collapse of the system.

So it is anti-Greek to demand that rules are followed?

As long as he isn't using his religion to justify hurting people like radicals of any religion do (and from what I understand, religion is not accepted as justification for violent acts in Belgium anyway).

Going to war is... generally bad. If he was coerced, that's probably illegal. 

Shunning his family and friends because they didn't approve of their religion... that's a shitty thing to do. But he didn't hurt them or forced them to obey his religious rules, nor he discriminated non-Muslims under any official capacity (eg, he wasn't a store-owner refusing non-Muslim costumers). Shittiness is not illegal, right? 

So yeah, I can see a problem (possibly being coerced in fighting in a war), but the article is more broad than that just to create a story that sells more.

What concerns me really is that religious courts pop out everywhere. I don't think religious courts should be allowed to exist even if they are ""voluntary"" and apply only to those who agree to get a ruling from them (how do we know they are not coerced in doing so?). We had a Christian Family Court up until few years ago here but it was dissolved. And it had really few powers of course, nothing like full-blown religious courts like those advocated by extremist anti-democratic groups. Of course even here, nothing stops the Orthodox Church from influencing the legislators and using their wealth to codify their beliefs into laws, but I am sure Belgium does not have *this* problem.

&gt;Thanks to the efficiency of the anti-aircraft and bluffing measures, damage was limited. Only 5% of the bombs fell within the city, and some of these fell in the large uninhabited park areas causing no damage. Some 2,000 bombers participated in the three great raids on Helsinki and dropped some 2,600 tons of bombs. Of the 146 who died, six were soldiers; 356 were wounded. 109 buildings were destroyed, 300 were damaged by shrapnel and 111 were ignited by the bombs. The Soviets lost 25 aircraft.

No sane person is going to defend criminals, no matter their motivations. 

But when you are quick to target all &lt;XYZ&gt; people for the crimes of some of them, you push all of them towards extremism as a knee-jerk reaction. More or less the same happened with Roma people. They were so marginalised and betrayed now they don't even trust mainstream society anymore. 

I am willing to give credit to those who say that you cannot tolerate intolerance. No religious laws, no religious courts, no allowing people of some religion to violate universally accepted rights of other people because their ideology dictates so. But that's not even remotely as common. And labelling it a ""muslim thing"" is not helping, it does the marginalising thing I mentioned above to come even sooner. Take a look at Georgia and Russia those couple weeks, and the Eastern Orthodox countries in general. They are a mess of religious violence too, and it's not by Muslims. Everyone can seek to impose their religious views on others and make the state a semi-theocracy. Those people must be stopped when they go past freely expressing opinions and start hate speech, incitement to violence and committing actual violence.

L'effondrement des régimes communistes a des causes matérielles diverses selon les pays. Quand au rôle des partis communistes dans le monde, c'est une approche franco-centrée qui ne tient pas compte des partis communistes en Inde, au Népal, dans le Burkina Faso jusqu'en 1986, et au Bangladesh, qui sont des partis forts avec une base idéologique solide, et des moyens d'action français.

Les communistes français, et ce depuis fort longtemps, ne sont jamais débarrassé de la vieille morale catholique de charité qui pourrit leur base idéologique.

B) Ah bon ? Et les cités c'est quoi ? Non seulement il y a un prolétariat, mais en plus la classe ouvrière européenne se reprolétarise a un rythme galopant en Italie et dans des régions de la grèce.

The UK average speed is [12Mbit/s](http://media.ofcom.org.uk/2013/03/14/average-uk-broadband-speeds-hit-double-figures/) and as such we are fairly behind on the internet stakes. 

That's not to say that we're all so slow though - I'm on 100Mbit/s fibre optic for example. Virgin Media are currently pushing out 120Mbit/s which should be available in the next year. And 1Gbps? Ahahahahaha... oh, yea, I wish. Not even a distant hope yet.

**Fibre Optic:**

on Virgin Media (100-120Mbps) - £25/month (€30/Month)

on BT (76Mbps; max speed on their cables) - £25/Month (€30/Month)

on SKY (38Mbps Max) - £15/Month - (€18/Month)


*Note that with the above we typically buy it with TV packages and that this is the most common way to buy broadband here. So you pay around £50-100/month and get your TV (TiVo/Sky Box/BT Box), phone and broadband from one provider.*


These ones are standalone broadband which fewer people typically get:

on EE (38Mbps Max) - £16/Month (€18.70/Month)

on PlusNet (76Mbps) - £18.32/Month (€21/Month)

on TalkTalk (76Mbps) - £19.00/Month (€23/Month)


Bare in mind that many people can't get Virgin Media in their location, and likewise not everyone can get BT Fibre either. So they will end up on standard copper wire broadband below: 

**Copper Broadband:**

on BT (16-20Mbps) - £15/Month 

on PlusNet (16-20Mbps) -£16/month

And the rest in this category are much the same. The big TV providers (Sky, Virgin and BT) will also give non-fibre broadband around these speeds for a little bit less money than their fibre packages.

Je sais d'ou viens le sentiment raciste, et je suis d'accord avec toi sur son origine. La situation sociale en france *explique* le racisme, mais ne le justifie pas. Et bien que le sentiment raciste ait son origine ici, son excarberation est l'oeuvre de la classe politique française. Après, nous n'avons pas les mêmes perspectives, et renvoyer les algériens en Algérie ne résoudra pas de problèmes, juste, cela les déplacera. Moi je suis pour la défense de tout les travailleurs, pas seulement des travailleurs francais/blancs/homme/heterosexuels ou autres.

&gt;Et elle ne passeront pas. Le communisme et la pensée américaine ça fait 2

McCarthy sort de ce corps ! Si le communisme et la ""pensée américaine"" font deux, comment expliquer la présence de communistes américains ?

&gt;Définitivement pas le principal endroit de production des richesses. Le prolétariat actuelle est en Chine et en Inde, et si tu compte prêcher la répartition équitable des richesse au partis communiste chinois, j'espère que tu résiste aux balles. 

Certes, mais tu utilise une définition marxiste-orthodoxe du prolétariat. Les immigrés ne produisent pas de la richesse en masse directement, mais ils servent ""d'armée réserviste du capital"", car leurs migrations sont exploitées pour faire baisser les prix des salaires, et donc assurer un rapport d'exploitation favorables aux capitalistes. Je ne comptais pas défendre la Chine post-maoiste.

* Michael Adebolajo, 28, a Christian convert to Islam, runs over and beheads a British soldier on a street in Woolwich. He was filmed making the following statement:

&gt;“The only reason we have killed this man today is because Muslims are dying daily by British soldiers.” “And this British soldier is one. It is an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

&gt;“So what if we want to live by the Sharia in Muslim lands? Why does that mean you must follow us and chase us and call us extremists and kill us? Rather you lot are extreme. You are the ones that when you drop a bomb you think it hits one person? Or rather your bomb wipes out a whole family?”

Ingrid Loyau-Kennett confronts the man. She tells a reporter:

&gt;“I spoke to him for more than five minutes. I asked him why he had done what he had done. He said he had killed the man because he [the victim] was a British soldier who killed Muslim women and children in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was furious about the British army being over there”.

Adebolago, like the Tsarnaev brothers (Boston bombings), had been followed by intelligence services for years. The Guardian reports:

&gt;had been known to the domestic security service MI5 and the police over an eight-year period

and that

&gt;Adebolajo … had complained of harassment by MI5 in the last three years after he came to the intelligence agency’s attention

Both incidents are still labelled by their governments ""lone wolf"" attacks. Both incidents are followed by government calls for further surveillance and sacrifice of democratic rights.

* Hundred of minorities in Stockholm riot in response to the police murder of a 69-year-old Christian Portuguese immigrant, Lenine Relvas-Martins. His 73-year-old neighbor is quoted:

&gt;""They had a bastard-load of police here. You would have thought there was a huge group of terrorists, not a man with a little knife,"" complains Milos, 73, Relvas-Martins's neighbour since 1984. ""If he was Swedish they never would have shot him. I'm sure about that.""

The police forces in Sweden have a record of racism and abuse in the minority ""suburbs"", similar to the situation in American ghettos and other European ""banlieues"". Police forces call rioters ""monkeys"", ""blackheads"", and ""negroes"". Sweden is increasingly segregated and unequal:

&gt;Despite Sweden's high living standards and its egalitarian ways, the country has seen the biggest surge in inequality of any Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development country over the past 25 years, according to a recent OECD report.

...

**Case A**

Fresh out of college. You get 50% of the value of the Reference Social Index (RSI) for 6 months. The RSI is 500 lei (€115) atm so you get €57 each month for half a year.

**Case B (everybody else)**

75% RSI (so about €86) - if you had worked for at least 12 months + *X*% of your average monthly gross base salary for the last 12 months. The *minimum* monthly gross base salary is 750 lei (€172) atm and will be 800 lei (€184) from July 1^st

Depending on how much you worked, *X*% is as follows:

- 3% if you worked for minimum 3 years

- 5% if min. 5 years

- 7% if min. 10 years

- 10% if min. 20 years.

The benefits last for 

- 6 months if you worked at least 1 year
- 9 months if you worked at least 5 
- 12 months if you worked at least 10 years.

It may of course jail ... which will add to the one she is currently serving. The patient is indeed imprisoned in the prison of Bapaume (Pas-de-Calais). The judges of Amiens had to know a similar case in April 2011. The ""mule"" was carrying 4 grams, five times less than the patient to the hospital north.

There are a number of Megafon leaders who have said that racial slurs are being used by the police. There are also numerous reports of teenagers and residents who make this claim as well from a variety of news sources.

Who is this ""brother of the Megafon organization's spokesperson"" who ""stated that what they want is for whites to get out of ""their"" neighbourhoods long before the riots even began"".

That's quite a claim to be making. I hope you can provide evidence. Otherwise, you come off as someone who is exaggerating, at best.

&gt;It's a bunch of bullshit from the very people encouraging the rioting and stonethrowing at ambulances, fire trucks and cop cars.

This was also claimed by whites during America's urban riots of the 1960s. That the rioters are simply hooligans. The facts do not bear this out and neither do the statements of those participating in them.

The police are seen as an occupying force in these neighborhoods because they very simply are. Sweden is segregated by design, as is France, as is Germnay, as are sections of America.

&gt;The rioting neighbourhoods get more money put into them than entire counties. As some commented: maybe they're rioting because the free Ipads weren't the latest version?

The Swedish Local reports:

&gt;Another foreign reporter asked me if there has been looting as with the English riots, and there hasn't been, as far as I know. I heard one report of youths stealing a few cans of soft drink from a pizzeria, but that was the extent of it.

Note: Most of the 2011 English rioters were poor white and black youth, not Middle Easterners.

Also:

&gt;Sweden is the country where the level of relative poverty has increased the most since 1995 [from 4 per cent of the population to 9 per cent], which is why it has slid from first place to 14th position in the rankings, although it still remains over the OECD average of (11 per cent of the population in relative poverty).

Sweden also has the fastest *growing* inequality gap in Europe.

Also:

&gt;Reuters notes that 15 percent of the population of Sweden is foreign-born, and experiences unemployment at 15 percent. Unemployment for natives of Sweden is at 6 percent. Worse still, as the Washington Post reports, ""Swedish youth unemployment stands at 25.1 percent, about triple the level of overall joblessness.

La composure si mantiene abbastanza facilmente. Quando sei in chiesa per lavoro, tutto quello a cui pensi è assicurarti che tutto fili liscio, e il prete manco lo ascolti.

Attivi il trasferimento di chiamata dall'agenzia al cellulare e passi la serata a casa in attesa (e con la speranza) che succeda qualcosa. Purtroppo non puoi allontanarti o impegnarti in cose che non potresti mollare immediatamente e andare a lavoro, perché non sai mai quando potrebbero chiamarti e devi essere sempre pronto all'azione. Questo per tutti i 365 giorni dell'anno.

The reality is the limiting factor always. Even if Greece didn't use Euro, they would be in the same situation because they can't print US dollars, they have to earn them by trading with the rest of the world. What the EU has given Greece is emergency funding that has bought some time, that unfortunately the Greek state hasn't used so well.

&gt; One moment you are blaming the greek gov for their inability to set up nation-wide foodbanks and provide underage students with daily meals, and the other you are protecting for the EU's right to call the shots on where their support packages' money go to. Since the Greeks are pretty much penniless, that can only mean that it's the EU's choice to have no welfare.

I have always pinpointed inefficiencies. Many times money and resources can be saved by organizing things differently, for example leveraging scale of economies. In a situation where Greece is, creating new born efficiency is vital to stabilize the situation and create in time new growth.

In case of EU money, what you don't seem to understand is that Greece in the situation that is it, because everybody broke and bend the rules until corruption and inefficiencies made the Greek state unmanageable and choked the Greek economy. While bending and breaking rules may create some piece of mind to somebody somewhere for a short while, it will create in long term lots of headaches and jeopardize the functioning of the system itself.

&gt; Sure. So this is the plan; Raise taxes, offer no substantial subsidies or stimulus, kick employees from the public sector, deny welfare to almost 3 million people with absolutely no source of income to buy food.

The global economy is growing all the time. It is up to Greek state and the Greeks to reorganize their society to tap into that growth. Now if the Greeks and other EU countries find themselves unable to do so and need continuous assistance, then it could and should put under negotiations on could the EU extend its competencies, but that would essentially mean that sovereignty of member states would largely come to and end: under unified system for example Greek styled and scaled corruption would be unacceptable and severely punished and rooted out of the system.

The EU could easily afford this welfare, which would at least, even without sovereignty allow the society not to collapse, and people not to, you know, starve to death, which seems inevitable if this keeps up.

Even the IMF and the ECB had supported this move; but it's the EU which considers a moral conundrum to be arbitrary bureaucracy and not starving citizens.

Is this supposed to be united Europe? On one side of the continent 40-year olds deal with their mid-life crisis by buying expensive cars, and in the other, there are parents who can't feed their children properly.

&gt;What the EU has given Greece is emergency funding that has bought some time

Time for what? To increase taxation? The income of the state has increased to the point that it has a surplus instead of a deficit. But what's the point? It doesn't have the option to guarantee the basic survival of its citizens.

&gt;unfortunately the Greek state hasn't used so well.

For crying out loud, we have already established that the greek state has absolutely no actual power over its budget. Stop blaming the sheer incompetence of the troika on some domestic politicians who are easy targets.

&gt;I have always pinpointed inefficiencies. Many times money and resources can be saved by organizing things differently, for example leveraging scale of economies. In a situation where Greece is, creating new born efficiency is vital to stabilize the situation and create in time new growth.

...which is irrelevant, because the actual elected representatives have no power over the economy. They simply follow the orders dictated to them by the EU. It's not within Greece's ability to develop welfare programs. 

What do you think the news are about? It's about the state trying to have welfare, but the EU disallowing it. You do realize that the Greek state has no substantial amount of money of its own.

&gt;In case of EU money, what you don't seem to understand is that Greece in the situation that is it, because everybody broke and bend the rules until corruption and inefficiencies made the Greek state unmanageable and choked the Greek economy.

Who is this everybody? Last I heard, the money tax evaders owed to the state was no more than 5 or 6 billion euros. As for corruption, there was simply not enough transparency from either of the two major ruling parties for the citizens to know that the debt existed to this scale.

&gt;It is up to Greek state and the Greeks to reorganize their society to tap into that growth.

With what money? How can the state pay for substantial stimulus when quite simply, it can not manage EU's money? This article shows by itself how they clearly have no control over their own budget.

&gt;but that would essentially mean that sovereignty of member states would largely come to and end

It is more than clear how much EU values domestic sovereignty, it's up to voters of idividual countries to support for an exit from the EU. That's not the issue. The issue is that, while the troica has complete control over the greek budget, this is the plan thus far: 

&gt;Raise taxes, offer no substantial subsidies or stimulus, kick employees from the public sector, deny welfare to almost 3 million people with absolutely no source of income to buy food.

It doesn't take a genius to deduce that when the consumers have no money to buy food, they can't spend money into buying stuff. Additionally, businesses can't grow overnight without stimulus.

&gt;under unified system for example Greek styled and scaled corruption would be unacceptable and severely punished and rooted out of the system.

Sure. Because the current plan that the IMF supports definitely battles corruption. 

&gt;That is again bias. Poor countries are poor and they have things poorly. They don't complain because things were even worse during communism and after the collapse in 90s. For example net average salary in Romania was 340e, just think about what it is like if you are pensioner or unemployed.

The only racism I was referring to was the lack of opportunity, I would not accuse the Swedish people of being racist themselves.  As far as the gender equality, that has gone too far is you ask me.

I believe the biggest issue facing Sweden (and most of Europe) would be self-segregation/non-assimilation of immigrants, particularly Muslims.  If you make life so comfortable people that they have no need to get a job, learn the language and culture, they are not going to do so.  In a way, I sort of understand.  I am an attorney for the state of New York, I am in a union, and short of showing up drunk, and murdering someone, I can not be fired.  In fact, there was an attorney who stabbed a coworker, and merely got sent home with pay for a few months, and ordered to get help.  Sometimes it is tempting to say ""why work hard, nothing can happen.""  So I can understand how immigrants who show up knowing nothing would say ""why should I learn Swedish and work hard, I will be taken care of anyway.""

Unemployment benefit is permament until you find a job or you don't refuse employment procedures by employment office (like job interviews and job offers). Unemployment benefit is paid every 20 workdays or 13 times / year. Thus monthly unemployment benefit is 21,5 workdays X 26 € = 559 €.

However if you have enough work experience (34 weeks in last 24 months) and you are member of a unemployment fund (membership cost about 99 € / year, depending on fund) you get income based unemployment benefit first 500 workdays of your unemployment.

Income based unemployment benefit depends on your previous wage. e.g. If your wage was 1500 €, income dependent benefit is 68% of your wage. 68% is maximum, and percentage gets lower what bigger your previous wage was. 

If you're still unemployed after 500 days, you will still get a basic unemployment benefit.

If you have children, you get additional unemployment benefit: 1 children 5,06 € / workday, 2 children 7,43 € / workday and 3 children 9,58 €

If you go an employment course or on-the-job training you get additional 9 € or 18 € / workday (9 € if course or job is inside or 18 € if it is outside of predefined commuting area).

You can also get housing benefit, which is about 220-300 € / month depending on your housing costs (rent / condominium payment, electricity, heating, water). How much you get, depends on your situation, for example if you are single, you get probably enough housing benefit to afford single bedroom apartment, but not larger.

true,elevencyan,null,null,"Dommage de commencer la playlist par ""ma conviction profonde"". C'est son seul discours dont je peux dire sans douter qu'il fait une erreur scientifique : penser que l'évolution soit un chemin tracé vers un but précis c'est mal comprendre le mécanisme de la sélection naturelle. Après tout, on a beau avoir muté jusqu'à devenir des singes intelligents, il ne reste pas moins d'organismes primitifs qui survivent encore aujourd'hui et peut être survivront alors que nous disparaîtrons. On ne remplace pas, on ne ""dépasse"" pas le primitif, on mute simplement à côté de lui. Rien dans l'évolution ne suggère une direction nécessaire, un chemin vers un but : si on parvient à se reproduire on survit, c'est tout. Si nous avions vécus au temps des dinosaures, sans doute n'aurions nous pas pu survivre à la chute du météorite, ni même aux grands prédateurs. La chance à aidé notre survie et notre évolution, rien ne prouve que nous n'aurions pas pu être plus intelligents, d'ailleurs l'homme de Neandertal était plus intelligent que l'homme de cro-magnon et c'est pourtant le premier qui a disparu et le second qui est resté. Nous ne sommes pas le ""sommet de la pyramide"", il n'y a pas de pyramide. Enfin si l'humanité survit telle qu'elle, elle n'évoluera pas, ou en tout cas pas en une humanité plus intelligente. Sans doute la sélection naturelle favorisera simplement ceux qui ont oublié de prendre la pilule ou la capote, au fond ce serait peut être une régression lente, les cons seraient de plus en plus nombreux. On peut aussi dire que l'humanité évolue par sa technologie, non plus par ses gènes, et ça c'est un autre espoir, mais Dieu est en dehors de tout ça.

As others said, we have plenty of examples of foreigners assimilating without any issues. Other Europeans (like the Polish workers) may not be the pinnacle of human civilization but they work really hard and never complain.

People from countries further away (Indians, Chinese, Koreans) assimilate without a problem while still keeping their culture, religion and customs.
