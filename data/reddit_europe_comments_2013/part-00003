Germans may be enamoured with the art and the easygoing lifestyle (while on holliday) but there is also little trust in the competence of italians .

&gt;Italy: Sexed up scammers. Rude. Problems with vocal volume.

&gt;Italy: Mobsters, pizza/pasta.

&gt;Italy: Lazy, corrupt and always riding a scooter. Like to harass our blonde girls and will sleep with any blonde no matter how ugly she is. Make fantastic food.

&gt;Italy corrupt as can be amazing history, classical architecture and art home of the renaissance. 

&gt;Italy: Sexual deviants who like to give our women sexy names and try them for murder just so they can sneak a peek

Dann mal ernsthaft: der Appell des Autors ist wirklich nichts Bahnbrechendes. Natürlich fällt Integration leichter, wenn man die Landessprache besser kann.   Vornehmlich geht es dabei imo aber um ernst genommen werden. Ganz ehrlich, welcher Satz hat mehr Überzeugungskraft ""Ey, isch schwör, die Lehrerin is so voll gegen Azzlacks, die drückt jedem voll so die 5 rein, ge!"" oder ""Also mir ist aufgefallen, dass die Lehrerin in ihrer Notengebung wahrscheinlich auch von der Herkunft des Schülers beeinflusst wird. Jedenfalls sieht es danach aus, als würden Schüler türkischer oder arabischer Herkunft besonders oft mit ungenügend bewertet werden - ungeachtet ihrer Leistungen.""  

Dieses Gefälle ist echt nichts neues, das hat Alfred Polgar schon in einem kurzen Essay in den 1920ern weitaus besser festgehalten, als ich das hier könnte (damals Wienerisch vs Hochdeutsch).

Ehrlich gesagt finde ich das plump zu sagen: die wollen nicht Deutsch lernen. Ich mache das viel mehr an fehlenden sozio-kulturellen Chancen, Forder- und Förderungen sowie Hintergründen fest.

Ich tue mich schwer damit, einen Bayer oder Sachsen ernstzunehmen, der kaum Hochdeutsch spricht. Genauso wie einen Deutschtürken der 3. Generation, der nur seine Mischsprache kann. Bei allen gehe ich aber zunächst davon aus, dass sie einem hochdeutschem Umfeld nur geringfügig ausgesetzt waren. Vastehste, Alder? Jo mei! Des Is döch klö!

Ich mag mein Hessisch. Ich höre Lieder in der Landessprache, trink voller Stolz meinen Schoppe und ess meinen Handkäs mit extra viel Zwiwwele. Trotzdem ist mir klar, dass mein Dialekt nur innerhalb sehr enger Grenzen Anerkennung findet.   Im Falle von Deutschtürkisch (oft gepaart mit jeweiligem Dialekt) sind die Grenzen sogar sehr eng. Big fucking news!

Ich wollte doch noch auf irgendwas hinaus? Ach ja: Lernt die Sprache! klingt erstmal einleuchtend und toll, ist aber wie hoffentlich stückweise aufgezeigt auch gar nicht so einfach, die Bereitschaft dazu hängt von so viel mehr Faktoren ab und dieser ganze Blogbeitrag ist nicht besonders hochwertig.

true,Furfaidz,null,null,"&gt;Yes, eating fish or pork is a lot less harmful than eating human. When you feed on your own, you get Mad cow disease-like prions entering the equation. Compared to that a bit of salmonella now and then is a breeze. It's biology and epidemidology, not morals.

Depending on what kind of fish one eats, one can get mercury poisoning. Also, pig meat is definitely not healthy. Eating too much rabbit meat would kill a human because of the extreme amounts of protein. I can go on forever, if you'd like, but humans are just as unhealthy to our diet as some other animals that some humans eat almost all the time. 

&gt;Everything is fucking sentient. I wish people would stop using that term as a magic word for ""smart as a human"". It simply means you are capable of perceiving the world and act on that stimuli. A spider is sentient.

I'm sorry, you're right, but I also don't think the word ""sapient"" works in this context because there are plenty of humans who are not sapient. When I am using the word ""sentient"" what I mean is self-aware and able to question one's purpose, that's all. I'm sorry I didn't address that, I thought we were on the same page.

&gt;The word you are looking for is sapient, and no: elephants and dolphins do not qualify. That's not to say they aren't smart animals, but that's not the same thing.

Because ...they're not hominids? Wait, are you speaking from a moral perspective?

&gt;In any case my point entirely is that purpose in domestication is meaningless for whether it is morally correct to eat an animal or not. You brought up the bull as an example of how a species not domesticated for its meat was by necessity used for it anyway in olden days. My question to you then: what do you think people do with dogs in times of starvation?

I had no idea the Swiss were starving (all that cheese and chocolate...). I need to catch up on my Swiss news. By the way, you do know when people run out of other animals to eat they eat other people, right?

&gt;If you think the reason you shouldn't eat human is because that's not ""humanity's purpose"" then I shudder to ever face you in real life, when the reason is supposed to be that it's wrong and evil to kill another sapient being and end their life against their will.

Ha ha, I'm basing purpose off of evolution, not some divine good versus evil. But yes, I do think it's wrong to kill someone against their will. The only time I would kill someone against their will is if that person is endangering the lives of other people. So yes, I don't want to kill other people and yes, it's because that's not what I'm supposed to do to my fellow homo sapien sapiens. 

&gt;In fact, I think you'll find, presuming from the fact that neither of use have brought up a religious argument in a debate about morals that we both share at least our sympathies towards an atheist paradigm, that things and species don't actually have a quantifiable purpose and that the whole point of life itself is seemingly to find a way to live and procreate on the terms of your species wherever and however, at the expense of other species if need be.

Homo sapien sapiens have always travelled in groups all around the world. The reason the Neanderthals died out is because they didn't have the urge to travel, to explore the way we do. I, as my duty as a human, must contribute to the well being of our humanity, our giant community, and to contribute to the well being of this planet, our home. Having sex isn't my only purpose and it shouldn't be your only purpose. You are able to think critically, and you are! Your arguments alone are full of so much passion. Our purpose isn't to *just* procreate (Sigmund Freud, however, would agree with you). We are intelligent as well. That's the difference between human and bonobos.

&gt;Regardless of whether dogs were domesticated to hunt or for slaughter it is not morally wrong to eat them.

You're right, it's not morally wrong.

&gt;nd also I don't know why you keep bringing up cannibalism when I've already said I don't disagree with it provided the people involved have legally consented, presumably making us in agreement about the issue (unless your point is that it shouldn't be wrong to farm people against their will in which case I must most strongly object).

So, it's not morally wrong to kill dogs and eat them but it's morally wrong to kill people (against their will) and eat them? ",0,1357447637,null,0,false,0,c7rulmb,t3_15mf1z,t1_c7rulmb,t1_c7pmj3d,null,1430870203,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Maybe not integrity, but most certainly free speech. You know, Mr. Cooper, that thing your country values so much, and often times proudly declares to do so far more than its European cousins.

&gt;Comparing a whole religious community with Islamic extremists whose ""essential contribution to the world consists of suicide bombing, extremism and hate"" crosses a line and steps beyond journalism, he added.

I agree with him here. Just because a religious community is ultra-orthodox doesn't make it extremist in such a violent manner. Which is a good thing to remember for all those ultra-orthodox Muslims who are falsly accused of being extremists, or whose brothers and fathers are liberated from their lives because of that.

Furthermore, we know such orthodox communities hold no sway in the politics of the United States or modern Israel, just as orthodox Muslims have no say in Palestine or its surrounding states, to the relief of the moderate parts of either religion.

Nothing bad coming from there, just peace and butterflies!

It's also very important to note that we should step back for a moment and try not to make any generalisations. For example, how ridiculous would it be to extend criticism directed against a state to be criticism of a religion. 

Or maybe even declare that any criticism of a hardline subset of one religion not only questions the validity of the entire religion, but calls for viewing the entire religion with a negative attitude, and such criticism is then extended towards attributing a socially inacceptable notion on the criticising person in order to stop him from doing his vile criticisin'. (*)

Or at least fuel the conspiracy theorist's idea that such a mean thing was going on.

That would indeed be very unwise.

&gt;Cooper said he welcomed the lively debate in Germany over Augstein's views. ""I invite Mr Augstein and the critics protecting him to take another look at his comments. They are indefensible.""

Ah, of course. The others are wrong because they are *wrong*. How could I not have seen that! It's *obvious*!

&gt;In a further escalation, the German Central Council of Jews – which condemned Grass for his anti-Israel poem in 2012 - came out in support of Augstein on Friday and said that the US organisation had not done its research.

But you cannot say that! Don't you know that he is an anti-semite! He openly criticises the hardcore minority of the major religion of a secular state and is angry at the fact that the whole arduous religious wrestling-match that is the Middle F. East is taking away room for his newspaper articles about how great Himmler was.

(I bet he's an anti-semite as well. Look, his sideburns don't even go below his neck! Hey Abe, you wanna back me up on that one?) 

Edit: 

Becoming serious again, though, I am glad that the discussion here in Germany is more civil. I am especially glad for the CCJ's actions, as it shows that it is able to differentiate between (unjustified or badly phrased) criticism and blatant hatred.

* Reserve your tickets far in advance, especially if you go on the highspeed trains (ICE, InterCity). They only have a limited number of cheap tickets. On the DB website there's a tool called [""Saver Fare Finder""](http://ps.bahn.de/preissuche/preissuche/psc_start.post?country=USA&amp;lang=en) that helps you to find a date on which the saver fare is still available. 

* If you have the time to use regional trains only, or if you stay within one state, they have regional offers that are not too expensive. There's a comparison of these offers [on their website](http://www.bahn.de/i/view/USA/en/prices/germany/regional-offers-overview.shtml). 

* The German version of the DB website has got a tool that might help you to choose your ticket depending on where and when you want to go, what trains you want to use ... You can find it [here](http://www.bahn.de/p/view/angebot/berater.shtml).

I hate it that a lot of these organizations equal ""critique on Israel"" to ""critique on Judaism"" and ""Antisemitism"" although these are complete different things.

Antisemitism would be that I didn't accept a Jewish person as a person or would dislike the person because of the fact that he/she is Jewish. Or that I doubt the right of the existence of a Jewish state just because it's Jewish.

Critique on Judaism could be that I say that I think it's against the right of physical integrity and/or the right of physical integrity is bigger than the right to exercise of religion if a child is circumcised. 

And critique on Israel could be that I say that the Lebanon war of 1982 was unjust and that I agree with the UNO that the Israeli settlement constructions are illegal and contravene the 4th Geneva Convention. 

Nothing of this has anything to do with the other two. Israel should not be seen as more than a state in his actions. That it was constructed as a state for the *Jewish* doesn't mean it's antisemitism when I object to the actions of the *state*.

Also - if I am criticizing something it must mean that I have accepted the party that I criticize.

* Voll-Damm is the special brew from Estrella Damm. I myself cannot stand Estrella Damm but this is a double malt, strong flavoured beer that has a really good taste.
* Monasterio de Yuste, a semi independent brand (I think it was bought by a big beer company or something) that makes what I like to call ""the beer spanish trappistes would make if there were spanish trappistes"". Dark, strong, thick beer, very tasty.
* Alhambra 1925. While I don't like Alhambra, this special brew is pretty good. Light on taste but high on alcohol volume.

There are many breweries in Spain but these are the brands you can found easily. However, if you're in Madrid there is one brewery that makes very good (and pricey) special beers called La Cibeles.

It can be explained because Normandy doesn't really have a claim for separatism other than the fact they have more viking blood than the rest of France, and a slightly different historical path a thousand years ago, like many French regions. Most groups just want reunification of both administrative divisions of Normandy (cause Normandy is inexplicably divided into two regions - high and low Normandy - it's like if Bavaria were separated in two states).

edit : of all things, French Flanders (north eastern France bordering Flemish Belgium) could be justified in this map more than Normandy, but it's still not very convincing. I'm not sure if it's shown on the map. Perhaps.

I haven't lived in neither Sol nor Moncloa, but if I had to choose amongst those two, I would personally go for Moncloa. Of course, that's just according to my taste and needs, and it all depends on what you're looking for: 

Sol is the *very* city centre of Madrid, you can't get more centric than that. It is very convenient, yet extremely packed, somehow noisy and touristy. It is a notorious area for pickpocketing. I have never checked this, but I'm guessing that Sol is more affordable than Moncloa (I may be wrong, though!).

Moncloa, although not that centric, is still within the city area, very well connected and a bit of a student neighbourhood, since it is home to Madrid's biggest university and, naturally, to many students. Depending on your exact location within Moncloa, it might get a bit noisy too though (oh, what the hell, anyplace in Spain can get noisy!). It is well known for its nightlife/bars/drinking out on the street (not a legal thing, yet a extremely commonplace practice in Spain). You should bear that in mind!

Moncloa is a rather vast area: it has both an urban (very Madrid-like) part, and a greener, quieter campus-like part with plenty of residence halls. You will find students living at both subareas.

In *general* terms, Moncloa should be safer, more expensive and more upscale than Sol, but I mean, it all depends on many factors. 

Hope you enjoy your time here :-)

Personally, I really like the Moncloa area. I lived around there for a month when I was studying here and I loved it. My favorite restaurant in Madrid is in that area as well.

It's very easy to walk to the center from Moncloa, maybe 20 minutes to Callao and it's a lovely walk. There's a fun atmosphere as a lot of students live around there but it's not horribly crowded like Sol is. You might have a hard time getting around Sol if there are demonstrations or on holidays (like last night, my GOD, the mountains of people!). I've seen rooms for rent around Moncloa that aren't bad but it's been a couple of months since I've looked at prices. 

Lavapies IS nice, don't let its reputation scare you away. People always try to sell me pot there but if you politely say no thanks, no one will bother you. It happens in Retiro as well so it's not just Lavapies. Lots of good food in that neighborhood.

He has done next to nothing to fix the Italian economy; to be fair it is in part because his power base was too weak but a very good example is the church businesses which are not taxed. He was asked what he planned to do about it right at the start of his mandate, during the press conference in which he announced his first policies and plans, and his response was ""we haven't even considered it"". 

The property tax (imu) is another great example, the money the government made from that was lost from vat (iva over here) with the great side effect that it really hurt businesses. 

He’s protected the banks, who are really profiting from the crisis, and the church, which has always preyed on the country.

That’s not to say he didn’t do any good, but I always find it strange people are so impressed by Monti when in reality he only seems decent because he came after Berlusconi.

Really? I am sure Berlusconi is intelligent, manipulative and everything else, but he has never, ever struck me as someone with a lot of *empathy*. Ability to fake it, and pretend he has feelings as everyone else, sure, but I have never thought that he really has those feelings. 

I just ment that in order to be a successfull and good politician, in my view, you do not have to be very emphatic. As in Anders Borg, who I mentioned. Not that I want him to go home and torture puppies, but I frankly don't care that much how emphatic he is, as long as he does what he does best - balances the budget.

Borg is not the leader of the country he is the Finance minister, so he doesn’t need to display emotional intelligence so much. It’s not his charisma people look to, it’s his ability to manage the economy. I’m sure Monti could be very proficient in that capacity (even though I don't personally agree with many of his policies), but he is not in that position he is the leader of the country.

Als Grass sein Gedicht ausspuckte hiess es: ""wir haben doch hier in Deutschland Israelkritik die kein Antisemitismus ist"". ""Die Debatte ist frei"" und ähnliches. 

In Wirklichkeit war alles was Grass folgte pure Verdammung. Die Diskussionsrunden damals arteten in persönliche Beleidigungen aus und das eigentliche Thema kam meist nicht einmal auf den Tisch.

Nun Augstein. Was auch immer da verwerflich war. Wer macht es denn besser? Wer traut sich den heute noch wenn er nicht selbst jüdisch oder Israeli ist? Wo findet den diese Auseinandersetzung mit der Politik Israels statt? 

DAS ist das was wirklich gefährlich ist. Antisemiten hatten wir auch schon nach dem Krieg. Die ganze Zeit über. Dennoch ist nichts passiert. Es wird auch nichts passieren. Es wird an den Stammtischen genauso über die Moslems gehetzt wie ggf. über die Juden (zweiteres habe ich zwar noch nie gehört aber angebl. soll das ja so sein). Was aber auffällt ist die fehlende kritische Betrachtung Israels in den Medien. Das fällt den Leuten jedes mal auf wenn einer der Populisten wieder gekreuzigt wird. Es ist ein Ruf nach Antworten. Die Leute wollen sehen wie ""antisemitimusfreie Israelkritik"" aussieht/aussehen soll. Warum zeigt man uns das nicht? Vielleicht haben wir ja dann mehr davon.

Wäre ich Journalist, würde ich das Thema nicht mal mit einer Kneifzange anfassen. Das hat nichts mit jüdischer Weltverschwörung oder Einflussnahme des Mossad auf mich zu tun.

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"Basically, the police were wrong in attempting to detain her due to diplomatic immunity. She was in the wrong by slapping the police officer who was doing her job. One thing mentioned is that she slapped the person who was generally just standing next to her. Apparently her status does not make her exempt from being checked either.

The reason she slapped the police officer is because she wanted to proceed and they told her that she cannot without completing the security check.

I've watched a few discussions on the matter locally that more or less say that the police were doing their job according to the relevant laws to do with airport travel (which are based on EU regulations), so the Cyprus Police Association is talking with its lawyers to see if there is any way to initiate a civil or criminal action against the Ambassador. More or less it was explained that EVERYONE who passes through that checkpoint must undergo the standard security check if they want to proceed, no matter who they are (diplomats/politicians can proceed through a special VIP room). The police want to make it clear that assaulting a police officer is not an acceptable reaction by anyone (because it sends the wrong message).

Also, the support of the Egyptian government is desired due to the natural gas/oil developments in the region. They do not want to screw up relations over a silly ambassador. However, there has been an outrage over her behaviour and it seems the police association wants to proceed against the government's wishes (after having insulted the government over the apology).

*Another interesting piece of information often forgotten*: When she was taken to another room at the end of the video, it was to a senior police officer so that they can verify her identity and to give an explanation for her actions. Apparently she shouted at him and pulled his hair (which happened to be a wig). Shortly after, the foreign ministry gave an order to release her due to her diplomatic immunity.

Il nazionalismo si basa su ben altri concetti, e sinceramente se nel novecento si fosse discusso o lottato semplicemente contrapponendo culture diverse, e non odiando le altrui razze, le cose sarebbero andate diversamente. La cultura è stata lo strumento dei nazionalismi, ma è un altro par di maniche.

Purtroppo è vero che l'Italia è stata fatta male, il campanilismo impedisce di avere una visione d'insieme che vada un po oltre la periferia cittadina.

Und selbst dann wird man niedergemacht. Sei es dass einem Selbsthass vorgeworfen wird oder Korrumpierung durch &lt;beliebiges politisches Weltbild&gt;, oder dass man einfach zu blöd sei, oder dass man (mein Lieblingsfall) offenbar den Knall nicht gehört und im ""Diskurs"" nicht mehr auf Höhe der Zeit sei. Passiert das zu oft oder ist der Ton zu extrem, resigniert man einfach nur noch und hält die Schnauze.

Dazu muss ich aber anfügen dass derlei normalerweise nicht von anderen jüdischen Mitmenschen kommt, sondern entweder von Leuten die entweder man wohl nur als Mitläufer ohne selbstgebildete Meinung bezeichnen kann oder die politisch oder gesellschaftlich (oder wirtschaftlich wie im Fall Broder) Profit aus diesem selbstproduzierten Empörungsgewerbe schlagen wollen. Im letzteren Fall bin ich mir ziemlich sicher dass auch einige Soziopathen zu finden sind, auch wenn das sicher nicht auf die Mehrheit zutreffen wird.

Keine Ahnung worunter der Typ zu zählen ist auf den du geantwortet hast, wahrscheinlich ist er hier am üben.

&gt; Was aber auffällt ist die fehlende kritische Betrachtung Israels in den Medien.

Die gibt es schon, nur behält man sich in der Berichterstattung normalerweise jegliche Wertung vor, und das gilt für die Berichterstattung über jeweils beide Seiten. Problematischer ist da eher dass Zusammenhänge nicht, nur sehr simpel oder schlimmstenfalls komplett entstellend dargestellt werden.

Ich denke jeder hat mal erlebt wie über ein Feld berichtet wird auf dem man sich eine gewisse Professionalität erarbeitet hat. Kurz: Journalisten sind professionelle Journalisten und haben meist keine hinreichende Ahnung von dem was sie berichten. So wenig Ahnung, dass man manchmal schreien will. Wenn es um was Wichtiges geht und die Zeit dafür da ist, wendet man sich an Experten. Aber im Konflikt Israel vs Palästina wird praktisch jeder Experte für befangen erklärt, meist sogar von beiden Seiten gleichzeitig.

Wenn man mal die lärmenden Affen außer Acht lässt die alle Kritik ad hominem durchführen, so haben wir im Fall Augstein ebenfalls wieder so einen Fall, wo jeder dem anderen erklären will wie man dass was Herr Augstein geschrieben hat wohl zu lesen und auszulegen hat. Exegese über alles.

Wozu das führt ist klar: es wird immer weniger berichtet.

It was issued as an update on earlier versions from 22 June 2000 and 23 November 1993.[1] Excessive working time being cited as a major cause of stress, depression and illness, the stated purpose of the Directive is to protect people's health and safety.""*

An opt-out of this would give UK businesses an advantage at the cost of workers' health. The reason why we have directives like this for all of the Single Market is to prevent exactly that -- to prevent individual countries from attracting companies by having lower standards for working conditions, which would lead to a race to the bottom.

The price of access to the Single Market is that you accept a level playing field. Other members give your companies unrestricted access to their market not just because the other countries grant theirs the same rights in return, but also because one of the main features of the Single Market is that the same directives regulate business rules everywhere, including environmental regulations and minimum standards for employment laws. That's one of the things that differentiates a single market from mere free trade.

If the UK can't accept that, and even attempts to blackmail the EU by vetoing reforms that are essential to solving the Eurozone crisis and preventing the next one, then clearly we don't have a future together.

Don't get me wrong, I want the UK to stay in the EU. But not at all cost. The arrogance to think that the UK could dictate the terms of them staying to the EU, to me, very much sounds like the old joke about the Continent being isolated when ships can't cross the Channel due to fog.

Da stimme ich zu. Dennoch ist das keine Entschuldigung für diese Show der Empörung und einseitiger Polemik.

&gt; Diese Fragen setzen erstens das Ergebnis schon voraus, nämlich dass Israels Politik zu verurteilen ist. Der Gedanke, dass die Israelis gemessen an den Verhältnissen, unter denen sie zu operieren gezwungen sind, sehr viel richtig machen, ist für Dich schlicht a priori ausgeschlossen. 

Das ist doch der Major Consensus Narrative. Deswegen haben wir doch jetzt die Krise. Niemand schließt das aus. Man kann es gar nicht ausschließen weil es als gegeben hingestellt wird. Der einzige Punkt wo man sich etwas bückt ist die Siedlungspolitik. Da ist man sich ""uneinig"". Tatsächliche Kritik an aktuellen Expansionen o.ä. wäre undenkbar und ein Skandal. Das ist genauso wie mit Menschenrechten in China/Russland o.ä.. Man ist sich ""uneinig"". 

Ich habe nirgendwo gesagt, Israel würde nichts richtig machen. Kein Grund persönlich zu werden. Das was Israel gut macht ist hier kein Thema. Deswegen rede ich nicht darüber. Es geht darum, dass das was kritisiert werden sollte, nicht ausreichend kritisiert wird.

&gt; Dadurch, dass diese Leute sich bei jedem Furz eines IDF-Soldaten über alle Maßen entsetzen, aber zu Greueltaten in Sudan, Kongo, Nordkorea usf. schweigen, lassen sie erahnen, dass es ihnen letztlich weder um die Israelis, noch um die Palästinenser, sondern ausschließlich um sich selbst geht.

Mal abgesehen davon, dass ich keine Ahnung habe wen du mit ""ihnen"" meinst, vergleichst du hier Äpfel mit Birnen. Deutschland kann nicht aufhören Nordkorea U-Boote zu liefern die diese dann mit atomaren Sprengköpfen bestücken die die gesamte Nachbarschaft gefährden. Deutschland kann auch schlecht wirtschaftlichen Druck auf Nordkorea ausüben. Ich glaub noch mehr Druck geht da nicht mehr. Andere Gründe gelten für die afrikanischen Länder. 

Wir reden hier nicht über utopistische Diktaturen und Anarchostaaten. Wir reden über Israel. Einen demokratischen Staat. Gar nicht so weit weg.

&gt; Soso. ARD, Süddeutsche, SPIEGEL, SPON usf. reichen wohl nicht aus, wie?

Beiweiten nicht genug. Nicht einmal für Journalisten anscheinend.

&gt; Falsch, es ist ein Ruf nach Bestätigung der eigenen Vorurteile und Ressentiments.

Was du alles denkst von mir zu wissen.

Es ist lustig weil du trotz deiner Kritik die gleichen Fehler machst die du den reddits vorwirfst. Diese Schwarz/Weiss Logik ist auch Teil dieses Problems hier. Bist du nicht Pro-Israel, musst du Contra sein. Dann schaut man sich mal die Texte durch. Irgendwo wird schon ""Lager"" stehen. Fertig ist der Antisemit.

&gt; Antisemitismusfreie Israelkritik bliebe in den Regalen liegen wie abgereichertes Uran.

Sicher. Es würde nämlich um 2 Uhr bei ARTE laufen. An einem Dienstag.

&gt; Auch das ist Blödsinn: Journalisten machen mit Stimmung gegen Israel mächtig Kohle. Augstein ist nach wie vor Kolumnist. Grass tingelt weiter durch die Lande, um sein Geschreibsel zu vermarkten. Die einzige personelle Konsequenz aus dieser Sache war Broder, der den RBB verlassen hat.

Fallen die da noch mehr ein?

Broder hat den RBB freiwillig verlassen. In einer theatralischen Kotschrift bei dem Arbeitgeber der ihn ausreichend mit Kohle versorgt: Springer. Seine Sendung musste ausfallen wegen einem Special zum Thema. UNFASSBAR! Gestern hatte er bei achgut was gegen die GEZ. Das kommt an.

Bon, plus sérieusement. Déjà, le passage du taux marginal de 45% à 75% a l'air de le gêner, mais de la façon dont la phrase est tournée, t'as l'impression qu'il vaut mieux toucher 999 000 euros que 1 million. C'est racoleur.

D'autre part, on parle d'impôt sur le revenu, mais quand on atteint ces sommes là, on tripote aussi l'ISF. Et les différents types d'impôt et de contributions exceptionnelles additionnés font que le taux marginal n'est plus réellement de 45%, et qu'il n'aurait pas vraiment été de 75% pour la supertranche. Il faut que je retrouve les calculs, mais il me semble que c'était justement une de raisons pour laquelle le conseil constitutionnel considérait ça comme confiscatoire.

edit: Désolé, j'ai la tête comme une enclume ce soir (je dois être le seul idiot à avoir une laryngite plutôt qu'une bête gastro ou une grippe comme c'est la mode), j'en oublie mes bases. 

Donc, on disait: dès Septembre, il était évident que ça passerait difficilement, à cause de l'addition de la csg et de la disparition de la vieille disposition Rocard de plafonnement de l'impôt par rapport au revenu. 

D'autre part, ce n'est effectivement pas une tranche à 75% dont on parle, mais une contribution exceptionnelle de 18% qui s'ajoute sur les autres dispositions (tranche à 45%, 4% de contribution exceptionnelle sur les hauts revenus, et 8% de prélèvements sociaux), soit une base de calcul de 57%.

WTD (or any other such regulation) prevents excessive harm to society? Are you kidding me?

It does nothing of the sort! It merely interferes with the proper functioning of the free market and prevents those who'd be willing to work or employ under those certain circumstances unable to do such, therefore promoting uncompetitiveness and unemployment.

The last time CountVonTroll mentioned a race to the bottom, [I present my counter-argument](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/15pc4h/about_free_market/c7oqg1a?context=3), to which I got no reply. I don't want to go repeat myself so feel free to read my other post because it's quite similar to this one.

In short, yeah, the objective of the regulation is noble and fair, however what it achieves is not, it's only good for promoting inefficiency and allowing for ever increasing state interventionism in the economy.

If we are to tackle this problem, we ought to be letting employers and workers choose what's best for them and, at best, having the state promote a certain behaviour as to make it more beneficial for agents to do something in a certain fashion - not by setting minimum prices, limiting hours and making it unlawful to work in a certain way, that way we're just ignoring the issue and shoving it under the carpet, we're not actually dealing with it.

&gt;The point is simply that in a common market without harmonised regulation, any regulation at all becomes very expensive and difficult to enforce.

You're right, but there's absolutely no need for this kind of regulation at all.",0,1357500168,null,0,false,0,c7s4n6p,t3_16272l,t1_c7s4n6p,t1_c7s428l,null,1430875925,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1
true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Sorry, aber das ist nun wirklich lächerlich. Wenn Du das Wort ""Friedensprozess"" für einen Euphemismus hältst, dann gibt bitte an, wie ein Oudetephemismus/Neutrophemismus aussehen könnte.

Dann sag doch bitte mal ernsthaft was das Wort überhaupt bedeuten soll. Bisher heißt es doch nichts anderes als ""der status quo"", und der hat mit ""Frieden"" nunmal herzlich wenig zu tun. Das ganze dann als ""Friedensprozess"" zu bezeichnen *ist nun wirklich lächerlich*. Dass du deswegen ""Rabulistik"" und ""Unredlichkeit"" krähst enttarnt nur Unfähigkeit/Unwissen/Unwillen deinerseits.

&gt; Auch ist der Friedensprozess ein Anspruch gewesen, das Wort mithin nicht deskriptiv gemeint. Aus der Diskrepanz zwischen Anspruch und Wirklichkeit dem Begriff im Nachhinein euphemistische Qualitäten zuzusprechen, ist unredlich.

Der Prozess ist nun also zum Anspruch degeneriert? Das ist verdammter Bullshit und du solltest dich für diesen rhetorischen Blödsinn in Grund und Boden schämen. [Das hier](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Bill_Clinton,_Yitzhak_Rabin,_Yasser_Arafat_at_the_White_House_1993-09-13.jpg/300px-Bill_Clinton,_Yitzhak_Rabin,_Yasser_Arafat_at_the_White_House_1993-09-13.jpg) war ein Friedensprozess, und zusammen mit Jitzchak Rabin (der auf der linken Seite für die Spätgeborenen) ist dieser Friedensprozess 1995 gestorben. Kannst du ernsthaft *irgendeinen* Schritt in Richtung Frieden seitdem nennen? Ernsthaft!

&gt; Zu den Kosten der Sicherheit: soll das ein Scherz sein?

Nein. Mir geht es darum mit trivialer Logik deine rhetorischen Spielereien als solche zu enttarnen.

&gt; Ist es für Dich etwa schon zu viel verlangt, dass die Palästinenser bitte, bitte keine Artillerieangriffe auf israelisches Gebiet und auch keine Attentate auf israelischem Gebiet durchführen sollen, und ferner auch alle ähnlichen Aktivitäten von Splittergruppen unterbinden sollen?

Du versuchst hier wieder mangels mit deiner Meinung kohärenter Antwortmöglichkeiten vom Thema abzulenken. Nützt auch nix. Um direkt auf deine Frage zu antworten:

&gt; &gt; Welche Methoden sollten die Israelis denn Deiner Meinung nach anwenden? Bitte mit Begründung, warum sie wirksamer/für den Friedensprozess förderlicher sind, ohne auf Kosten der Sicherheit der israelischen Bevölkerung zu gehen.

Ganz einfach irgendwas anderes als derzeit? Wenn die derzeitigen Methoden offenbar nicht funktionieren um hinreichende Sicherheit hinreichend zu gewährleisten, dann sind diese zweifellos nicht nur unter humanitären Gesichtspunkten (Kolateralschaden auf palästinensischer Seite) sondern auch unter Pragmatischen (keine Sicherheit auf israelischer Seite) zu kritisieren, teilweise sogar zu verurteilen. Aber da du selbst dass nicht in deinen Schädel bekommst und trotzdem noch solche Gegenfragen stellst kann ich wohl genau so gut mit einer Wand reden.

Es gab mal einen funktionierenden Friedensprozess, und Kernpunkt dessen ist die Gegenseite zu respektieren und sie entsprechend zu behandeln. Kompliziert? Schwierig? Teuer? Oder einfach nur ideologisch unpassend?

Beispiel: Durchschnittlich alle zwei Jahre wird die palästinensische Infrastruktur bombardiert. Straßen sind gesperrt und um zwischen Städten zu reisen muss man oft stundenlang anstehen, teilweise steht man den ganzen Tag umsonst rum. Uralte Dörfer werden willkürlich geräumt und abgerissen um Siedlungen für religiöse Fundamentalisten zu schaffen, die dann auch noch teilweise von der IDF verteidigt werden müssen, ohne dass irgendwer die Bevölkerung vor den Siedlern beschützt. Denn israelisches Recht gilt praktisch nicht in der Besatzungszone und Vergehen werden in diesem rechtlichen Niemandsland nicht geahndet wenn sich der Täter hinter drei Meter Stacheldraht verschanzt. Das ist im besten Fall Provokation, im schlimmsten Fall offene Eskalation.

Das Land wird verarmt und jede Entwicklung oberhalb Unternehmenslevel aktiv unterbunden. Aus der Vergangenheit wissen wir aber auch dass es einen anderen Weg gibt. Es wäre kein großer Aufwand für Israel den Aufbau einer sinnvollen palästinensischen Infrastruktur zu unterstützen oder gar zu leiten: Krankenhäuser, Schulen, Polizei, Straßen und Versorgung mit Strom, Wasser, Kommunikation (indirekt machen sie das immerhin in diesem Fall, wenn auch mehr aus Gründen der Überwachung), und Güterverteilung. Stattdessen wird dies gewalttätigen extremistischen Organisationen mit Finanzierung aus dem Ausland überlassen, die sich im Gegensatz zu Israel lokal als Zivilisationsverteidiger aufspielen dürfen.

Wenn die derzeitige israelische Regierung und ihre mittelfristigen Vorgängerinnen sich gegen einen palästinensischen Staat sträubt müsste die endgültige Schlussfolgerung doch lauten das besetzte Gebiet endgültig zu annektieren und allen Einwohnern den israelischen Pass zu spendieren. Ernsthaft, fast nirgendwo in der Region haben es Araber so gut wie Palästinenser mit israelischem Pass. Was spricht dagegen? (Das ist keine rhetorische Frage, es gibt sinnvolle Antworten, aber die muss man erstmal aussprechen. Na los, keine falsche Scham.)

An anderer Stelle hast du schon angedeutet dass Kritik an Israel deiner Meinung nach unsachlich ist wenn man sich nicht in die Rolle eines Richters versetzt der auch Absicht und Gesamtkontext in alles einfließen lässt:

&gt; &gt; Der Gedanke, dass die Israelis gemessen an den Verhältnissen, unter denen sie zu operieren gezwungen sind, sehr viel richtig machen, ist für Dich schlicht a priori ausgeschlossen.

Dasselbe kann man auch dir vorhalten, wenn du, um Fragen auszuweichen, wie oben auf ein kindisches ""aber die Palästinenser!"" zurückgreifst. Dergleichen machst du in dem Beitrag ebenso:

&gt; &gt; Dadurch, dass diese Leute sich bei jedem Furz eines IDF-Soldaten über alle Maßen entsetzen, aber zu Greueltaten in Sudan, Kongo, Nordkorea usf. schweigen

Der Grund warum die Leute das tun ist weil Israel ein wirtschaftlich gut entwickelter demokratischer Rechtsstaat ist, ein Zentrum für Kultur und Wissenschaft. Bei deinen anderen drei Beispielen ist das zumindest im derzeitigen Zustand nicht gleichermaßen der Fall. Israel muss in Einzelfällen stärker kritisiert werden weil man von Israelis besseres erwarten *muss* - sie *müssten* es eigentlich besser wissen.

Dass diese Ansicht vielleicht nicht hinreichend pragmatisch ist um in Einzelfällen auf den genauen Kontext einzugehen - geschenkt. An irgendeiner Stelle muss man bei der Vergenauerung einen Schlussstrich ziehen, sonst diskutiert man irgendwann darüber inwieweit die Qualtität eines ersten Kusses über einen später begangenen Ladendiebstahl entschieden hat. Ding ist: bei Israel sind die Erwartungen einfach höher. Gleiches gilt auch für die Kritik an den Angriffskriegen der USA im letzten Jahrzehnt, und (Hallo, Godwin!) für Kritik am deutschen Giftgaseinsatz im ersten sowie Vernichtungskrieg und Holocaust im zweiten Weltkrieg.

(Disclaimer: Das heißt nicht dass hier Holocaust und Besatzung gleichgestellt werden sollen oder gar können. Nur für den Fall dass hier wieder jemand nicht lesen kann.)

Das ist es warum man durchaus erwarten *kann* dass Israel den ersten Schritt tut.

&gt; Es macht einfach keinen Spaß, wenn Schulbusse angegriffen werden.

Die Antwort darauf kann doch aber keineswegs Gewalt gegen Zivilisten der Gegenseite sein? Oder bist du anderer Meinung?

&gt; Ich habe den Eindruck, dass Du nur hier bist, um Rabulistik zu betreiben.

If regulation was preventing a race to the bottom, then you'd at least expect that everybody would go with minimum/maximum allowed by law, which is never the case. It's the same argument with the minimum wage, actually - you're just outlawing people from doing certain things, you're not actually going to the root of the problem and solving it.

We're talking about supply and demand of labour here, just like companies want to minimise costs, workers want to maximise benefits, since there's no monopoly and no single worker or company has a dominant position, nobody can act as a monopoly and act on the detriment of others. This type of regulation which institutes minimums and maximums only makes sense and is efficient in a monopoly situation, and that isn't the case, WTD is then inefficient in achieving its goals.

&gt;Regulations prevent a race to the bottom not only within the common market but with those outside it.

Also false. This regulation is only good at increasing the size of the informal economy within the EU and making us less competitive than our neighbours because they don't have to abide by our rules. If you want to end with some behaviour, you shouldn't make it illegal to engage in it but rather make in unprofitable.

On the long run, it's the whole economy and sustainability of the EU that's at stake.

&gt;The UK seems to want to be in the common market but playing with China rules.

This is such an insane comparison, I don't know how you buy into it. They just don't want to be uncompetitive and aren't deceived by the noble goals of these directives, which again, the label is great, better labour conditions, who'd be against that?, but the actual effects of those measures are wholly harmful for us all.

&gt;That is not fair at all.

Unless you impose these laws on the whole EU, massively crack down on the black market and ban all external goods that aren't produced according to these laws, what will be unfair will be the competition EU companies will have to face against the Swiss, the Turks and the Russians who will not have to comply with this short-sighted regulation.

It also will not be sustainable for the EU economy to make its labour laws so inflexible and will set a bad precedent for the future - that which regulatory arbitrary values are good in fighting these issues and that the state as opposed to the workers, the unions and the employers is actually the one that knows what is best for the parties involved.",0,1357508674,null,0,false,0,c7s7frt,t3_16272l,t1_c7s7frt,t1_c7s6l66,null,1430877251,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Sensible regulations such as a tax on pollution or stricter safety controls, sure, of course. But limiting work hours or having a minimum of paid holidays isn't sensible, not even close.

&gt;Here in the real world when regulations mandated working hours, the average working hours went down

And so wages also went down.

&gt;holidays went up

And so wages went down once more, profits were reduced and the cost to the final consumer went up - essentially making the whole economy more uncompetitive.

&gt;and overall compensation didn't decrease.

Except that it did.

&gt;Quality of life increased for the average worker.

And quality of life reduced for the worker who's no longer employed.

Really, why do you need to impose these caps? If before regulation someone had 10 days of paid vacation and a wage of 5000€ and someone else had 40 days of paid vacation and a wage of 4000€ and everybody is happy, why should the EU (or anyone, for that regard) step in and say the guy who only gets 10 days of paid vacation should have instead 30 and why should wages go down across the board to pay for this added expense?

We've had decades without this regulation and we've been fine all along, don't come now saying we need this regulation and that it will benefit us all because it will increase holidays and limit work hours because while it might be true, it has its drawbacks as well and in a free market we should let the parties involved decide what's best for them instead of saying everybody should have x and y and z and the uncompetitiveness generated by that be damned.",0,1357513514,null,0,false,0,c7s934u,t3_16272l,t1_c7s934u,t1_c7s7sxj,null,1430878105,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,RobertTheSpruce,UKGB,United Kingdom,"A manned station requires there to be a crew there on that station or on the fire appliance all the time. 6 people at all times. Plus managers to run the station and that is if the station only has one fire appliance, if they have more: more people. Each getting paid, plus utility costs, maintenance, training, equipment, all the costs related to running any major business. manned stations have many calls. Usually several per day. 

An on call station only pays it's staff when they are required to attend calls. They carry pagers, which beep when they are needed, then they get to a station within 5 minutes to turn the appliance out. They are on call because there are fewer calls in that area, as low as 50 per year, or as many as 500, depending of course on what happens that year. 

In the UK, a firefighter gets £13 per hour. Wages make a huge portion of that chunk. 

So if a Wholetime station gets 1, 1 hour call in a day, they are paying £13 x 24 hours x 6 people (I'm ignoring the £15 per hour the crew manager gets, the £18 an hour a watch manager gets and the £20 per hour the station manager gets, and leaving it at 6 firefighters, which is less that what a station runs on - 4 firefighters, 1 CM, 1 WM, 1SM is the norm for a 1 appliance wholetime station). You can do the maths.

If an on call station gets one, 1 hour call in a day, they are paying £13 x 1 hour x 6 people. A hell of a lot cheaper.

Basic calculations, leaving a lot of outside costs out (such as fuel and utilities), but help towards the point I think.

Obviously this means that wholetime firefighters on a manned station get a large wage at the end of the month, an on call firefighters wage depends heavily on how many fires/car accidents there were, meaning that to ensure they can live, on-calls need a second job, if they have a 35 hour per week job, the working time directive will limit them to only being able to give 13 hours per week after those hours to the fire service, making them next to useless to the fire service, particularly as you cannot predict when someone is going to dial 999 and call for help.

Tours was the capital of France for around 100 years during the renaissance and its patrimony is very important. It's a very medieval city that was partially destroyed during the German occupation during WWII so you've got an interesting mix of two different sections of the old city separated by the newer bit.
Lots of regional food specialties, too, and Tours is now an official French gastronomic city (after Paris and Lyon). There are lots of well-known wines in this region and tons and tons of castles, as well.
I can't compare the music scene with that of Montpellier but I know there are a lot of festivals in the summer, the biggest of which being Les Terres du Son in Monts followed by l'Aucard de Tours. There are also many small scene bars and clubs for many different types of music. If you like jazz, there is Le Petit Faucheux literally around the corner from l'Institut de Touraine.
Tours is a great railway hub as well so when you want to travel, it's quite easy to navigate all around the country fairly easily. Paris is just less than an hour away by TGV and you can get to London from the Tours airport in less than two hours.

&gt;In your definition is there also no demand for cheap knockoffs? People know it might be inferior yet they demand the cheaper good anyways. 

So GMO's are cheap knockoffs then?

&gt;The infuriating thing is that there is no evidence that GMO foods are less safe or lower quality. 

So? People have a right to choose, do they not?

true,akkahwoop,null,null,"Quibbling over the definition of a word? The one place where a dictionary argument applies very relevantly. 

Secondly, it doesn't matter what word you use for it - call it racism, call it something else. It is still definition of humans along racial/biological lines, which in reality have no moral significance. Criticising someone/something on a racial basis is morally wrong, it doesn't matter what word you use to describe it. It is a way of discriminating against people unfairly, since race does not present a reality-grounded basis for criticism - it is an uncontrollable quality which should have no impact on anyone's perceptions of anyone else. 

It doesn't matter how easy/successful/prevalent racism is. If black people were the so-called 'dominant racial group' of France, it would still be a bad thing to be racist against black people. I'm living in Uganda in the next couple of months, but that gives me no moral right to criticise a black person for being black, although I will be a minority which is often discriminated against in that country. Racism is something which is evil regardless of context. 

The *problem* of racism against a certain group in a country can be measured in its seriousness by its prevalence/nature, but that's not the same as grading individual acts of racism on how acceptable they are. The UK has a less serious rape problem than Sweden, because Sweden has a much higher rate of (reported) rape. That's verifiable (or falsifiable, I may be totally wrong on my statistics). But that doesn't mean that a rape in the UK is less serious than a rape in Sweden. France may have a more serious issue of racial prejudice against non-whites than against whites, but that does not make racism against whites any more acceptable than racism against non-whites, since racism (or whatever word you want to use for the belief that being a certain race is more/less desirable/morally good) is something that is intrinsically evil.",0,1357519819,null,0,1357522506,0,c7sb5r0,t3_14nqk7,t1_c7sb5r0,t1_c7rz1t8,null,1430879079,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6
