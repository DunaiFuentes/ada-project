true,All_Hail_Pancakes,EURO,European Union,"&gt;Any Poles care to weigh in on this? Do you think the time is right for Poland to assert itself with a little more confidence?

It definitely helps that unlike the rest of Europe, Poland didn't go into recession. So if there is a time when Poland should start catching up with the bigger European armies, it is now. We are a country of almost 40 million people, and our foreign and defence policies should reflect that.

What I don't like in Polish mentality is the chronic fear of Russia. There is absolutely no chance Russia would invade members of the EU/NATO.  Yet, we act like the invasion is approaching. 

&gt; I would like to see NATO re-focus on its initial task. That is, the defense of mainland Europe. It doesn't do NATO's reputation any good when its deployed in Middle Eastern countries that pose no threat to the West.

Two things here. 

What are the countries that NATO/EU/West intervened in that they shouldn't have? If it's Iraq, then I agree with you, we should not do that in the future. If it's Afghanistan, then it's debatable. It  can be seen as a justified intervention, but it was not conducted with enough care and resources. If it's Libya, then it was vital for European security to intervene there, and obviously it was sanctioned by the UN on humanitarian grounds. SO overall, I would say that going back to territorial defence would not be the best choice for NATO. Instead, there should be more effort put into planning and carrying out tasks in the European neighbourhood when our vital security interests are at stake.

And secondly, reputation and security do not always go hand in hand, and policy-makers are forced to make difficult decisions. The West is criticised for not doing enough to stop the Syrian crisis, but if they did do something more robust, they would be criticised by others for getting involved. It's a tough job for policy-makers.",0,1376602657,null,0,false,0,cbok8zq,t3_1kfo0o,t1_cbok8zq,t1_cbog7ii,null,1429815674,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Bene. Portiamo avanti questo ragionamento: i delitti commessi dai poveri sono molto più numerosi di quelli commessi dai ricchi. Aumentiamo, quindi, le pene per i poveri e aggiungiamo un'aggravante molto pesante per i poveri che commettono delitti che portano danni ai ricchi. Così per scoraggiarli e bilanciare le cose. Che ne dici?

&gt;che è quel che significa omicidio di genere, cioè che vai a colpire la donna in quanto donna che non si sta sottomettendo a te come uomo, non il tizio random che spara a una tizia random per rapina, metti

La parte della sottomissione l'hanno aggiunta i giornalisti. Nella definizione ufficiale i ""femminicidi"" accadono con motivi strettamente legati al ""genere"" (inteso come ruolo sociale, per allargare la categoria oltre il sesso biologico). Quindi non una lite di coppia dove lei schiaffeggia lui, lui schiaffeggia lei, lei impugna il tegame, lui impugna il coltello. No. Se venisse applicata alla lettera, pochi degli omicidi in ambito familiare cadrebbero sotto questa definizione. Troppo pochi per gridare all'emergenza.

&gt;Perciò un uomo che non ha intenzione di uccidere la sua compagna penso possa dormire sonni tranquilli, si.

Perfetto. Quindi non dobbiamo più preoccuparci dell'eguaglianza. Basta non commettere reati e le discriminazioni dentro le leggi non ci toccheranno mai.

&gt;Vai a dirlo alle donne ammazzate che è solo una campagna mediatica.

Hai ragione. Non si possono fare campagne mediatiche se le donne sono ammazzate davvero. Nemmeno se il loro numero rappresenta un terzo o la metà delle vittime uomini. Nemmeno se il numero di omicidi rapportato alla popolazione generale è basso e in continua decrescita. Nemmeno se tutte le complesse motivazioni dietro ogni particolare caso vengono assoggettate alla storia degli uomini che odiano le donne. No. Mai e poi mai...

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"&gt;It definitely helps that unlike the rest of Europe, Poland didn't go into recession. So if there is a time when Poland should start catching up with the bigger European armies, it is now. We are a country of almost 40 million people, and our foreign and defence policies should reflect that.

Do you think that if Poland modernizes, and expands its military that this will warrant it more influence in EU? What about national prestige? I don't want to offend you here, but Poland is still kind of viewed as a wounded nation. Do you think in a few years Poland can shake this image, and instead be viewed as a confident, competent power as opposed to a tragic victim? What about the national psyche of Poland? Do you see the citizens of Poland becoming more proud of their own nation if it can evolve into a respectable power?

&gt;What I don't like in Polish mentality is the chronic fear of Russia. There is absolutely no chance Russia would invade members of the EU/NATO. Yet, we act like the invasion is approaching. 

I can understand that mentality. Poland will eventually need to move past that, but Poland will never be able to change its geography, so it will always be close to Russia. Maybe a little vigilance isn't so bad. Do you think recent events reinforce this view among the Polish elite? The plane crash in Smolensk, and its aftermath, certainly didn't help improve the image of Russia in the minds of the Polish. This article also references Russia's rearmament, and subsequent posturing in the area. That also doesn't help Poland lose its fear of Russia.

&gt;What are the countries that NATO/EU/West intervened in that they shouldn't have? If it's Iraq, then I agree with you, we should not do that in the future. If it's Afghanistan, then it's debatable. It can be seen as a justified intervention, but it was not conducted with enough care and resources. If it's Libya, then it was vital for European security to intervene there, and obviously it was sanctioned by the UN on humanitarian grounds. SO overall, I would say that going back to territorial defence would not be the best choice for NATO. Instead, there should be more effort put into planning and carrying out tasks in the European neighbourhood when our vital security interests are at stake.

&gt;And secondly, reputation and security do not always go hand in hand, and policy-makers are forced to make difficult decisions. The West is criticised for not doing enough to stop the Syrian crisis, but if they did do something more robust, they would be criticised by others for getting involved. It's a tough job for policy-makers.

I actually agree with pretty much everything you said here. I was kind of playing my cards cautiously in my initial comment because I know the issue is very contraversial. So in that light, it seems like you think that Europe not only needs to protect its borders, but also secure its sphere of influence in North Africa, and the Middle East. Those are very volatile areas, but intervening in those countries is always risky, and not a lot of countries agree with that stance (or at least that's my impression). Do you think there is enough common ground among European countries to agree that North Africa and the Middle East should be viewed as vital to their own national security? I think any sort of expansion of NATO's sphere of influence to include its neighboring areas would be very difficult to get all the European countries to agree on.

And a final question (sorry, feel free not to answer any/all of these). Where do you think Poland will be by the end of 2020?

true,HoveringOverYa,veneto,null,"&gt;Bene. Portiamo avanti questo ragionamento: i delitti commessi dai poveri sono molto più numerosi di quelli commessi dai ricchi. Aumentiamo, quindi, le penne per i poveri e aggiungiamo un'aggravante molto pesante per i poveri che commettono delitti che portano danni ai ricchi. Così per scoraggiarli e bilanciare le cose. Che ne dici?  

Ma che ragionamento è? Tanto per cominciare definiscimi povero o ricco, secondo non mi pare ci sia un'insorgere di poveri che ammazzano ricchi perchè i ricchi si trovano in una posizione di vulnerabilità o per sfogare i loro istinti violenti. Peraltro io non sono neppure d'accordo con l'inasprire le pene per una categoria sola quanto per cercare di cambiare la cultura che porta a certi delitti, cosa che tu non mi sembri molto propenso a fare visto che ti viene difficile perfino ammettere che si, in effetti le donne in sud america subiscono molte più violenze in famiglia degli uomini... e pure in Italia. Mi spiace, ma questi sono i fatti.  

&gt;La parte della sottomissione l'hanno aggiunta i giornalisti. Nella definizione ufficiale i ""femminicidi"" accadono con motivi strettamente legati al ""genere"" (inteso come ruolo sociale, per allargare la categoria oltre il sesso biologico). Quindi non una lite di coppia dove lei schiaffeggia lui, lui schiaffeggia lei, lei impugna il tegame, lui impugna il coltello. No. Se venisse applicata alla lettera, pochi degli omicidi in ambito familiare cadrebbero sotto questa definizione. Troppo pochi per gridare all'emergenza.  

Infatti la maggior parte rientrano sotto la definizione ""la donna viene menata a sangue o minacciata finchè non viene mandata all'obitorio"". Mi pare preoccupante che tu non riesca neppure a prenderlo in considerazione.  

&gt;Questo è l'equivalente logico dell'arrampicarsi sugli specchi. L'intenzione presunta, le priorità altrui, il peso, il sesso, l'aspetto fisico, la religione, ecc. non sono argomenti validi. Tu, per soddisfare la tua curiosità puoi chiederti tutte queste cose, ma non fare l'errore di pensare che siano valide per l'argomentazione.

Veramente sono molto valide per l'argomentazione, giacchè perchè le cose siano paritarie dovrebbero venir meno le ragioni per cui c'è una percentuale del 20% in più di donne morte in conflitti famigliari. Chiaramente ci saranno sempe i violenti e le violente... però ci sono più violenti. C'è anche da aggiungere che il restante 30% abbondante include anche uomini uccisi da altri uomini in famiglia, quindi mi sfugge proprio perchè sia irrilevante parlare della cultura del machismo e della violenza, visto che sono esattamente le cause della maggior parte degli omicidi contro chiunque. Scusami ma sembra quasi che preferiresti che le donne uccidessero di più così siamo pari invece di preferire che gli uomini uccidessero di meno.

EDIT Andrei anche piano a parlare di ""continua decrescita"" senza i numeri effettivi in mano, perchè facendo supposizioni da quel poco postato qui ne emerge che in un semestre del 2012 sono state uccise 53,5 donne, mentre in questo semestre del 2013 sono 61.

This is probably my biggest fear, as it does not look good right now if you look at our domestic politics. Not sure if you know much about Polish party politics, but essentially, there are 2 major political blocks (plus a 3rd of Socialists, but they're too conflicted between themselves to have much relevance). The current government (coalition of PO and PSL) is a centre-right, pro-EU, pretty liberal, etc. And as much stick as they get from the public nowadays, Poland has developed well under their rule, gained a lot of influence in the EU due to their close cooperation with Germany, as well as improved relations with Russia to some degree. 

Unfortunately, the ruling party is losing support to the other block - the right wing, xenophobic, EU-sceptic,  parties. I'll go as far as calling them Russo- and Germanophobes. If those guys manage to win the next elections (2015 IIRC), there will be a major U-turn in Polish foreign policy. They will not want to cooperate with Germany, they will block EU reforms, they will confront Russia. 

So Poland in 2020 can either end up being a leading nation within the EU, having a major impact on the economic and security policies; or it will end up isolating itself from the rest of Europe.

&gt; The plane crash in Smolensk, and its aftermath, certainly didn't help improve the image of Russia in the minds of the Polish.

The leader of the main right wing party (Jaroslaw Kaczynski) that is gaining support is actually a twin-brother of the Polish President (Lech Kaczynski) who died in that plane crash. As you can imagine, he accuses the Russian and Polish governments on conspiracy and assassination. And his supporters follow that belief, unfortunately. So while the government now tries to rebuild relations with Russia, the opposition is actively undermining every effort, and if they win the elections this will get even worse.

And while Russia is rearming, it is not difficult to imagine how any use of military against the EU/NATO states might end. Even if we take NATO's nuclear deterrent out of the equation, the EU alone has a more capable army than the Russians, not to mention NATO as a whole. So I do not think we have anything to worry about.

&gt; Do you think there is enough common ground among European countries to agree that North Africa and the Middle East should be viewed as vital to their own national security?

I believe we will get to that point soon enough. The EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, and Common Security and Defence Policy, are still in early stages, but I think it is becoming increasingly obvious to the leaders that if Europe does not speak in one voice when it comes to its outside interests, it will not have any impact. And this is true within and EU as well as NATO. After all the USA is focusing more and more on Asia, so Europe, whether through NATO or the EU, will have to protect its interests on its own, or only with a marginal U.S. support.

Cannabis is not legal in the Netherlands. It is illegal, but up to a certain amount (I think 5g) it's not enforced. That means that the police can take away your 5g of cannabis if they want (for whatever reason), but you can't be prosecuted because of it.

We also have our 'coffee shops', in which cannabis is sold. Again, these are permitted, but their license can be revoked at any time, for whatever reason. This combination of illegality and non-enforcement is called ""gedoogbeleid"" in dutch.

A third part of this policy is the education on drugs. Everybody is taught about the effects of the most common drugs at schools, and their risks. (Edit: Education rather than propaganda. I personally think this is a good idea, because, if you tell people about drugs and add some lies to it to make it sound more scary, some people will find out it's not true and then they won't believe the true parts anymore either.)

as part of my argument.

You're headset to identify your own honeycombed vision of possible federalism as the panacea to anything that might be happening now.

&gt;The changes to the rules are not negotiated by ""self-identifying federalists"" but by national governments.

Well, not after November 2014 - as has already been passed, but the same national governments are using the EU as side path, themselves not wanting to actually be representative.  

&gt;the rules were negotiated before the crisis and have proven to be only partially adequate for dealing with the crisis.

Breaking Article 125 *IS* the crisis.  Article 125 served to contain debtor nations, forcing them to go through the IMF.

&gt; The idea that they're pre-planned sneaking steps on a pre-determined road to federalism is utter, utter twaddle

Yet here we have a bundle of people willing to admit that it was always the aim, and then willing to push through Lisbon as something else without letting people read it.  To ignore the intent of the people.

&gt;Although of course that doesn't mean anything to you, since the apparent political difficulty in negotiating them is presumably just smoke and mirrors, while the results are automatically bad because they're 'federal'.

Again, you lapse.    

All I said was judge federalism by these federalist in power, and what they've done.

This is the point where you go back to your first position that the federalism that is currently happening, or has already happened, is unpopular and so it couldn't possibly be true.

You might yet try to address that how the rejection of the constitution, and then the subversive push to introduce all the competences anyway,   duplicitous, as a good thing.

Well, perhaps to put an end to this increasingly circular debate, and to save us going over absolutely every red herring and smoke bomb in the eurosceptics' arsenal, I'll repeat the point that the federalism you ""see happening"" actually isn't, because, to repeat myself again, what you're seeing is a vision you've constructed.

What I see is a rather Heath Robinson thing constructed partly by several sets of well-meaning people with different goals (including, yes, actual federalists that you can quote and everything) and mostly by a combination of pragmatic horse-trading and a willingness to bend where necessary. It's run by the governments of Europe, poorly controlled by the legislatures of Europe, and if it ceased to exist tomorrow, it would be reinvented starting Monday morning.

It's neither a last great hope nor an evil empire, it's just a framework for solving European problems jointly, to the extent that national rivalry and the desire of national politicians to hold onto national powers allows.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"A process called ""plea bargaining"" is one of the main reasons that so many Americans are in prison.  Here is what it is.  When a person is accused of a crime, the prosecutor will offer him a deal: either go to trial for a very serious offense (e.g., drug trafficking), or plead guilty to a lesser offense (e.g., felony possession of drugs).  If the person pleads guilty to the lesser offense, he is sentenced without a trial.

The serious offense is usually more than the prosecutor could prove in court.  Therefore, if the accused has an attorney, the attorney's main role will be to investigate the evidence, point out that the threatened charge is outrageous, and get the state to offer a better deal (e.g., the offer will be changed to a choice between a trial for felony possession or an admission of misdemeanor drug possession).

As you can see, the process is a negotiation.  The state views it as a way to reduce the cost of prosecution.

Almost everyone who is accused of a crime pleads guilty to a lesser offense and thus doesn't even get a trial.

You seem quite willing to accept that Federalists are in the shop, but absolutely resolved against even looking at what they have actually done - beyond some skyward-unbacked claim that the Reform Treaty was accepted and the Constitution rejected, not because of the transition of powers which were the same, but because people (and this was really bizarre of you) were worried about how it was presented!!!

Wear a scarf when it gets colder, wear tighter pants than you usually would (wear briefs instead of boxers), same goes for shirts.

carry a small bag with you instead of stuffing everything in your pockets (you can't do that with tighter pants). get over the weird idea of ""man purse"" bc it's really normal for european men to carry bags solely because they are functional for carrying more than just a wallet. (in your case this will be a map, copy of your passport, your scarf when you go indoors, umbrella, or even a spanish dictionary etc.) 

use an umbrella when it's raining.

don't wear ""tennis shoes"" unless they're classic sneakers or obnoxiously bright colored ones -- i.e. black leather shoes will fare you well. Flip flops are also a no-go unless maybe you're going to the beach. 

Outer wear like north face makes you stand out. Wear black  pea coat or a black rain coat. 

Don't wear baseball hats or hoodies unless you are exercising.

The khakis and polo shirts won't look bad, but they won't allow you to blend in. The closer fitting your clothes the more likely you are to not stand out, and the sleeker the fit, the less american you will seem. 

feel free to shave your arms and legs and buy some designer shades (/joking (kind of))


Source: my drunken opinions/intuition of male spanish fashion, 3 years post living in spain 

All of the cities you listed sound awesome. If you can, go to Salamanca, it's really awesome city with a huge international community and a fun night life. I would say bussing and trains are an economic way of traveling, but if you're short on time there are ""cheap"" flights, in that, they cost a small amount in dollars but you pay in other ways, such as unreliable service, or getting bags lost (so only bring what you can carry in a backpack). 

During a typical day, travel in the smallest group of American you possibly can, and if you do, try your best to speak Spanish and if you must speak english, do it quietly so as not to be obnoxiously loud. Don't wear baggy pants/tennis shoes/hoodies/baseball caps (unless you are exercising). Try your best to speak Spanish as much as possible and try to adjust your accent to match the region you're in. 

The best thing you can do on a study abroad trip is to make foreign friends. Try your best not to only socialize with the group you are with (I'm just assuming your'e going with a group since most programs do that).

Don't be afraid of exploring on your own and getting a little lost. 

Don't eat at restaurants that have pictures of the meals outside (it's meant for tourists). Try foods you don't think you'd like, and don't feel bad about buying things you end up hating - it's part of the experience. Find holes in the walls that are crowded with people. Ask for suggestions too. Side note: restaurant service can sometimes be worse than the worst service you've ever had, and the restaurant/servers don't give a shit about your opinion on it, so just deal with it. 

people may seem ""rude"" to you (a lot of my american friends often commented on this), but don't take it personally.

Drink red wine (vino tinto), draft beer (una caña), and shots (chupitos) with new friends. Grocery stores have much cheaper beer though, and ""chino shops"" sell 40oz of san miguel. And as a side note, know where hospitals are and how to contact them in case someone gets alcohol poisoning (happened to someone I knew).  

This goes without saying, but definitely don't buy weird drugs from people (like 'molly' in a capsule, or 'shrooms' in pill form).

I saw some ppl smoking lines of cocaine in joints... weird stuff.

Most of all, let go of your inhibitions, let yourself be a different person than you are at home. Make memories, don't spend too much time talking to friends and family from home because you will be back sooner than you can believe. 


ok that's enough rambling. i love spain and i hope you have an amazing trip that you never ever forget and want to talk about it all the time for years after you come back

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"Okay. So I've kind of developed a strange fascination with gypsies. I don't know why. But after seeing so many threads about gypsies on /r/europe, I started looking for information about gypsies in America. As of now, I have only met one person in my life who has had gypsies in his town. He hated them. Apparantely they were all crooks and liars and thieves. I guess that dispenses the notion that America can magically integrate everyone. As if people come here, breath in American air and somehow become model citizens. Anyway, I saw this guy's description of gypsies in his town in Texas. Since I have never seen or met one, I was hoping if you, or someone else could tell me if this description is accurate:

&gt;Back when I was younger I used to work at Westgate car wash (wow that's been a LONG time ago....) and the gypsies used to come into to the service center and pay to get their tires and wheels taken off one truck and put onto another. Come to find out, they were going to local car dealerships and test driving the high-end and custom conversion pickup trucks, and driving them to the carwash and a few other shops in town and swapping the tires and wheels whenever they wanted a new set. Those are some shiesty folks, there ain't nobody they won't try to rip off. 

&gt;Have any of y'all ever been to the gypsy camps?? Odd bunch of folks. They all live in mobile homes and RV's, except for the leader. They live in this huge brick house out there with a big wrought iron and brick fence. And the leader and his wife are referred to as the king and queen. I am not EVEN kidding. When the elderly ones become unproductive they get sent away from the rest of the ""tribe"", sent to live in the old raggedy trailers and campers and are treated like $&amp;!+. They for the most part are inbred. They have a an elevated number of handicapped children, and they are rarely seen in public. Those who do marry outside of the clan are outcast. 

&gt;They are a very peculiar group. Would be very interesting if they weren't so shiesty and cooked. 

Is this shit true? Do they really have a king, or queen, or a leader that runs the gypsy tribe? For some reason I thought it was odd that there was one gypsy who basically lived better than everyone else in his group.

I quoted a Danish MEP with the same concerns, and provided a video in the European Parliament, that said the very opposite.  Again, Ostrich You chose to ignore this to continue a line of investigation that didn't apply.

&gt;You keep using integration - QMV, handing competences to the EU - as evidence that the EU is federal,

No.  

I used QMV as an example of how they are moving away from unanimous sovereign state approval.  I mention competences in regards to the rejected Constitution and the forced through Lisbon treaty, in that both had the same competences - and as such they were willingly circumventing the people.  That is an example of what these federalists are willing to do.

&gt;The fundamental divide here is my view that the EU is not a federal body but a partially integrated intergovernmental framework. It's not federal because what would be the ""federal centre"" is not in charge, but is subservient to the states,

The fundamental divide here is that you're still using pre-2009 arguments (or getting/basing your information from someone still using earlier/outdated arguments)!   

You try saying that post-Monti, refusing Greece an election on time or deposing a leader, or Cyprus having its 'common currency' effectively froze.  They'll see your 'federal centre not in charge', and raise you a Troika!  And after the Turn, in a poker sense, they'll then meet any river with the QMV that has already been passed.  QMV directly means overturning sovereign states.  That's what it is.

The thing that was very wrong with this system was - specialized containers had small holes that you could only throw one bottle at a time. So you gathered all plastic bottles in one huge sack for a month, went to the container and spent 15 minutes throwing one by one through that hole.

But it's heavily influenced - we have many words from English, and even some proverbs/idioms are translated, when we already have Polish idioms for the same thing.

But it's nothing new, really - before it was French, before that Italian and Latin. In 15th century already Polish writers were complaining that ""Poles are using Latin and Italian everywhere instead of Polish to show off and it's destroying our language"".

Somehow the language survived that just fine, and we got many words from these languages, so we have bigger vocabulary now and more detailed distinctions (when we loaned words for same thing from many languages the words develop slightly different meaning, and when English have to say ""non-rechrgeable battery"" or ""rechargeable battery"" we simply use ""bateria"" and ""akumulator"").

As long as we keep our flexion system Polish is fine. But yeah - it's sometime unnerving to see English idiom ""search-and-replace""-translated when we have Polish version that makes much more sense in our language (like ""exclusive interview"" translated as ""ekskluzywny wywiad"" - WTF? that's not how ""ekskluzywny"" works in Polish, it's false friend).

In the end languages are a means to communicate, and if there are not many other people to communicate with, there is no practical reason to learn a language not widely spoken.

Besides - regular Ukrainians are affraid that after hypothethical accession their industry would be overrun by EU, and they would be reduced to ""colonial"" state - huge market for EU and source of cheap labour that western companies will use. 

They know they can sell stuff to Russia (if they ""behave"" at least), but they don't know whether they can sell to EU(will EU allow their goods or ban them using one or another silly excuse, and are their goods even good enough to sell on EU market).

The university there was founded in the 1200s (3rd oldest in europe). The city is a great cultural contrast to the ""hispanomusalman"" culture of cities in andalucia. The medieval city of salamanca has Celtic, Roman, and Muslim sites, but the city stands as a great catholic castillian stronghold.

Salamanca was the birthplace of the spanish language, with the first known writings in Castillian Spanish orginating there. There is the main cathedral as well as a jesuit basilica. The plaza mayor of salamanca is considered the most outstanding in all of spain.

Did I mention its a university city?? La universidad de salamanca is the largest international university in spain, drawing in students from all over spain and all over the world. There are 3 other universities including one based at the Jesuit ""Universidad Pontificia.""

... all that makes for some of the best night life in spain. Great bars and clubs include: Khandavia, Berlin, Paniagua, Camelot, Gatsby, Chupiteria Daniel's, La Chupiteria, and People. When you're partying, get an agua de valencia: .5L Champagne, 2 shots vodka, 2 shots triple sec, topped off with orange fanta... literally tastes like orange drink!

Have a great time in Spain! Become friends with spaniards/ Latin Americans so you can learn the language. Bring a pocket dictionary everywhere and a pad/pen and write down ALL the new words, phrases, and colloquialisms you learn.

As for madrid, 7-story club called Kapital. each floor has own bar and own DJ. 18 euro cover at the door. Opens around 11 but doesnt get pumping til like 1:00am, so drink plenty of cheap beer at a cerveceria before hand. I recommend Sidreria el Tigre located near Plaza del Sol... 6 euros for a liter of beer or sangria and ALL THE TAPAS YOU CAN EAT

Tapas are not free in Madrid. They are free entriely in Leon and partially in Cordoba and Grenada. By that I mean its hit or miss in those cities.

It's happening all over the country; people (almost entirely expats in my experience) who speculated on flats five years ago and can't sell them for the price they want have found an easier solution to make money: just stick them on airbnb and rent them out cheap! No business license, no permit for renting holiday apartments, no inspections or worry about fire escapes or any of the dozens of other things these places must legally have to protect drunk tourists from themselves and one another. And at the same time they drive down hotel prices, fucking over the companies that actually invested in a business and paid the fees. And of course they pay no taxes either, since it's all cash in hand. 

Meanwhile, you have a place like Gràcia which is (or was) a residential area and not zoned for hotels and holiday apartments for a reason, and suddenly it's inundated with busloads of bucket-and-spade types on a cheap self-catering bender. Do they patronize the Catalan businesses? No, they shop at the Apus. They buy beer from the Moros who have been attracted by the new ""tourism"". And of course spend the nights shouting and pissing in the streets. 

I don't think those signs are passive aggressive. I think they're showing an impressive amount of restraint.

""Pathetic"" false friend (patetyczny) is used incorrectly - in Polish it means roughly ""too serious"", ""pompous"" and now it's often used like English pathethic.


We have proverb ""z deszczu pod rynnę"" ([to hide] from rain under the drainpipe). It's basically the same as English ""jump out of the frying pan into the fire"", and the Polish idiom is even shorter, but still I've heard people using translation of the English idiom (wyskoczyć z patelni w ogień). We also have ""zamienił stryjek siekierkę na kijek"" (uncle swapped an axe for a stick) which is similar and rhymes.


""[być] między młotem a kowadłem"" ([to be] between an anvil and a hammer) is basically ""to be between a rock and a hard place"", and I've heard this literally translated to Polish too as ""być między kamieniem a czymś twardym"" and it sounds stupid.


I've seen people write sarcastically on internet boards in such way: ""Świetny pomysł. Nie"" which is direct translation of ""That's a great idea. Not"". Or ""Ale z ciebie bohater. Nie"" (You're such a hero. Not). In English it's common, in Polish it sounds completely off, ""Nie"" doesn't work that way, all words would change if there was contradiction at the end, but still people do it.

In Italy Mussolini tried with the [""iron cop""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Mori).  
A more or less similar situation it's narcos in south america, Chomsky told us what DEA tried there: brute force, it doesn't work.  
I am in no way a ""pacifist"", I think there are situation in which ""brute force"" is usefull and therefore justified, trying to tackle well organized crime circles that are **deeply** entrenched in the history of the place and have a somewhat social side to them (which makes a crime circle into proper mafia in my book) it's another game entirely.  
I mean both Narcos and the Italian mafia are not just a bunch of bikers, they are entrenched with the population and play the card of being ""the good thief"" and they do offer a perspective of some sort to the people there: in short they use politics and create very complex economical organization based on a number of company and workers which have nothing to do with the mobsters (usually they don't even know they are working for mobsters and if they do they are required to act like they don't know it, or else).  
  
In south america the very poor farmer who lives far away from cities has no support from the govt. and actually is left by the govt. at the mercy of ""developer"" that created just big properties to apply modern intesive culture and cattle farming for the highest possible profit in the short term, the poor farmer ends us even poorer, instead they can sell the coke they grow to the narcos, and they scrape a decent living out of it.  
Everyone has interest in this solution because it make everyone happy: the developer get it's profit from the cattle and intesive farming, the govt. doesn't have to think about the poor farmer and neither has to risk them becoming insurgent, the narcos guy have their coke to sell, the farmer can scrape out a living by selling it's grown product to someone: everyone is happy.  
In southern Italy there's no economic tissue (it's a very long story, at least a few books long and it's not just about economy and money but also political indepence), mafia provided jobs in a similar way and plaid their cards with govt. and the state in an even more cunning way.  
I'm not justifying anyone, I'm explaining it from my perspective of a guy that was born in mafia country in souther italy and ran away as fast as he could.
  
In such condition if police forces start to use brute force you just play the mafia game and make the population support them.
that's why I say that the only possible way to tackle this kind of crime issue radicated in socioeconomical condition is to change those socioeconomical condition and not just use bruteforce and especially NOT create those agency with limitless funding and immunity, they're gonna start use that immunity for tackling those mafia criminals probably without success, like it happened in southern italy or with the narcos in south america and after years the purpose will change but the immunity stays, and they start to do like NSA and use it for other purposes.

It was when the glorious Russian Baltic Fleet mistook some British fishing trawlers for Japanese torpedo boats...  I'll let wikipedia take it from here:

&gt; The disaster of 21 October began in the evening, when the captain of the supply ship Kamchatka (Камчатка), which was last in the Russian line, took a passing Swedish ship for a Japanese torpedo boat and radioed that he was being attacked. 

&gt; Later in the night, during fog, the officers on duty sighted the British trawlers, interpreted their signals incorrectly and classified them as Japanese torpedo boats. The Russian warships then trained their searchlights on the trawlers and opened fire. The British trawler Crane was sunk, and its captain and first mate were killed. Four other trawlers were damaged, and six other fishermen were wounded, one of whom died a few months later. 

&gt; As the trawlers had their nets down, they were unable to flee, and In the general chaos, Russian ships shot at each other: the cruisers Aurora and Dmitrii Donskoi were taken for Japanese warships and bombarded by seven battleships sailing in formation, damaging both ships and killing at least one Russian sailor and severely wounding another, and fatally wounding a naval chaplain. 

&gt; During the pandemonium, several Russian ships signaled torpedoes had hit them, and on board the battleship Borodino, rumors spread that the ship was being boarded by the Japanese, with some crews donning life vests and lying prone on the deck and others drawing cutlasses to repel a boarding. 

&gt; More serious losses to both sides were only avoided by the extremely low quality of Russian gunnery, with the battleship Oryol reported to have fired more than 500 shells without hitting anything.

The Russians, incidentally, were on the way to East Asia. Their Asian Fleet had been beaten badly by the Japanese and was bottled up in Port Arthur. The Baltic Fleet, sent to relieve them, arrived after eight months, only to be completely devastated in the Battle of Tsushima.

The problem here is that apartments, as /u/alaninsitges put so perfectly, are rented for short stays, while not paying any taxes or whatsoever as hotels and hostels do. Tourists are not to blame, though, but landlords, who instead of renting apartments to locals for a ""local"" price, they rent it to tourists for three times the usual rent a local can afford. If only tourists can afford such prices, who would buy at local shops? Does a tourist need a haircut? Do they buy clothes for their kids? Do they need schools? No. Therefore, the local economy dies out and is replaced by bars, restaurants and souvenir shops.

&gt; And to the guy who says it would be great to shut down half of the restaurants and bars; you have no idea what you are talking about.

What the grammer?

&gt;And who did it belong to before Hungary invading it? That's right. Romania.

There was no ""Romania"" before 1859.

&gt;If the Hungarians can make a legitimate claim how Transylvania is theirs because Attila the Hun invaded 1000 years ago, then by that logic Romania can also make a legitimate claim on half of present-day Hungary, as it was part of the Dacian kingdom before the huns invaded.

Both claims are equally stupid.

&gt;And that majority is, *and always was*, Romanian.

There is insufficient evidence to say for sure that ""it always was"". Regardless, it doesn't really matter what the ethnic composition of Transylvania was in the 12th century.

ultimately they will make it difficult (and costy) enough to really wipe them out and in the interest of the power that be to let them stay there.

There is a lot of criticism on the policy though. The left-wing parties and the progressive right wing all want some form of government-regulated soft drugs production, and some of them want to legalize the coffeeshops too. There is currently an experiment going on in the city of Rotterdam, where they're producing their own drugs.

On the other hand, the three christian parties all want to stop the non-enforcement policy. This is also the case for the freedom party (conservative far right) -I think because they're competing for votes with the christian democrats- and the conservative right-wing (VVD) is against further legalisations because of international reasons. They also want to ban foreigners from coffeeshops.

The problem is, that the Netherlands are far too right-winged for any progressive coalition to get a majority. In the past, the christian democrats would slow it down, and now the conservative right-wing is doing the same. At least the current government was able to allow for foreigners again.

&gt;Should we make stripping illegal then?

Who exactly are you arguing against? 

&gt;What do you propose we do then?

Societies tend to legalize prostitution and act as if all problems have been solved. I say societies need to consider who chooses prostitution and why. If the why relates to a lack of alternatives rather than as an ""idea"" career choice, said society needs to figure out why this happens and whether anything can be done about it. 

Just to be clear, I never said we should ban prostitution or stripping, ever. I was replying to cbfw86 regarding permissiveness vs. progressivism. My main view is that the view that many progressives hold - that legalizing prostitution will solve all problems - is a simplistic one.

Obviously these are predictions based on current trends. As I said as well, many things can happen that can hinder or help India's development. But the prognosis seems rather positive.

What makes me think that India will be better off than China is the domestic politics. As you said, India is already a democratic country, whereas China is a weird mix of capitalism and authoritarianism under the guise of communism. There are growing pressures from extreme nationalists on one side, and proponents of greater liberalisation and transparency on the other, as well as issues with minorities. So we can also wonder whether or not China itself will 'rise' or not. I'm not saying that India doesn't have its own population pressures, but China seems to be more likely to be unstable due these factors, at least for now. But I guess since we don't have a crystal ball to tell the future, we'll just have to wait and see.

&gt;""When we look at the sometimes pathetic contributions being made by some countries inside NATO, the European elements of NATO cannot expect the US to come to our aid on every occasion. Far too many of our partners are still trying to get a free ride and they should regard Libya as a wake-up call.

That would have put the climate in the British/Irish region at temperatures colder than what's currently seen in northern Norway or in Iceland.

You're talking about someone performing surgery on you and taking out an organ that is vital to your well being. You cannot equate having sex to that. 

&gt;Societies tend to legalize prostitution and act as if all problems have been solved.

What societies? 

&gt; I say societies need to consider who chooses prostitution and why. If the why relates to a lack of alternatives rather than as an ""idea"" career choice, said society needs to figure out why this happens and whether anything can be done about it. 

So your main problem with legalising prostitution is that people would go into it because they want to make ends meet as opposed to choosing it because that's what they want to do? Why is that an issue?

&gt;Just to be clear, I never said we should ban prostitution or stripping, ever. I was replying to cbfw86 regarding permissiveness vs. progressivism. My main view is that the view that many progressives hold - that legalizing prostitution will solve all problems - is a simplistic one. 

Would you rather have prostitutes wander the streets under the yoke of a criminal organisation or work in a clean, professional institution that has to follow standards and regulations? Legalising prostitution won't solve all the problems associated with it but it's definitely a step forward.

Quand Vergès défendait Carlos ou Klaus Barbie, il savait que le procès était perdu d'avance et qu'il n'arriverait évidemment pas à disculper son client. 

D'où la ""stratégie de rupture"", où il ne s'agit plus du tout de défendre l'accusé mais ""d'accuser l'accusation"", avec un procès qui devient pour Vergès une tribune personnelle où il peut faire entendre les causes qui lui sont chères (le plus souvent, l'anticolonialisme).

C'était l'occasion pour Vergès de flatter son ego, loin de l'idée conventionnelle que l'on se fait de la justice. Admirateurs et détracteurs du personnage sont d'ailleurs d'accord pour rappeler son narcissisme démesuré.

Dans [l'article du Monde](http://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2013/08/15/l-avocat-jacques-verges-est-mort_3462241_3382.html) sur sa mort, bien plus approfondi que celui du Figaro, il est d'ailleurs rappelé qu'au-delà de la défense de grands criminels et terroristes,

&gt; Jacques Vergès, drapé dans son personnage, a défendu mille autres accusés de façon la plus classique qui soit : la défense de rupture, superbe dans le prétoire, a pour le client l'inconvénient de lui obtenir le maximum.

Cela confirme un peu ce qu'affirmait *Chelecossais*: la ""défense de rupture"" n'a pas grand-chose à voir avec la justice et ne grandit pas vraiment Vergès, qui a fait un très bon job d'avocat dans d'autres procès en s'en tenant à des stratégies bien plus conventionnelles.

Pour moi, la ""défense de rupture"" s'apparente beaucoup à un troll. Le raisonnement de Vergès était au fond assez simple: on ne peut pas reprocher à l'accusé d'avoir commis des crimes, aussi atroces soient-ils, car les Occidentaux qui l'accusent ont commis des crimes de masse bien plus atroces (et comme il s'agit de Vergès, ce sont les crimes du colonialisme). 

On peut percevoir assez rapidement les failles du raisonnement de Maître Vergès, qui décrit un grand bloc massif, ""l'Occident"", où tous seraient des salauds, et qui milite pour un système judiciaire parfaitement utopique où les procureurs n'auraient aucun lien , même indirect, avec les atrocités commises par leurs compatriotes.

Bref, Vergès détournait l'attention en ""accusant l'accusation"" avec des arguments très graves mais au fond assez bidons. Il était donc bel et bien un troll avant l'heure.

Just like when you are driving in the wrong direction on the highway and you wonder why everyone is driving in the wrong direction, and think: ""silly them""! Get real! :-)

Jokes apart, a couple of pointers:

0:16 the very open A at the end of ""allora"" is not standard Italian pronunciation. The O in the middle is off, too, with respect to the correct pronunciation.

0:33 the T in ""cascate"" sounds a little bit like a ""D"", kind of like the flap T in American English. This isn't standard Italian, neither.

0:44 ""Foto"" with the first O closed is very typical of Southern Italy.

1:22 he says ""sto a 50 miglia orarie"" instead of ""sono a cinquanta miglia orarie"": using the verb ""stare"" instead of ""essere"" is again a regional/dialectal variation used only in Southern Italy.

true,AFDIT,null,null,"&gt; It's happening all over the country; people (almost entirely expats in my experience) who speculated on flats five years ago and can't sell them for the price they want have found an easier solution to make money: just stick them on airbnb and rent them out cheap!

This is general practice across the world with Airbnb. Also the number of properties (it's **all** a speculative market remember!) owned by ""ex-pats"" (which I'm going to guess you mean as non-Catalan / non-Spanish and not Brits) is of course at a reasonable ratio given the number of people who live here who are from all over the world. BTW I think having such a wide diversity of people living in Barcelona is a great thing for culture, for lifestyle and for business.

&gt; No business license, no permit for renting holiday apartments, no inspections or worry about fire escapes or any of the dozens of other things these places must legally have to protect drunk tourists from themselves and one another. 

I have seen all sorts of accommodation in Barcelona that is rented on weekly, monthly or yearly basis which is *awful* compared to your average Airbnb stay. The people offering it may not have a license for renting (I believe the law only just changed to make ultra short renting illegal) however renting a room in a *shared* accommodation does not require these sorts of licenses. If you were to rent out an entire apartment on AirBnb I believe you would be in breach of this regulation.

&gt; And at the same time they drive down hotel prices, fucking over the companies that actually invested in a business and paid the fees. And of course they pay no taxes either, since it's all cash in hand.

*sigh*, the hotel prices have not changed in Barcelona since before the crisis. This amazed me when I looked into it. The downturn in the economy did nothing to deter people from thinking in a greedy manner and a lot **went out of business because they did not play the capitalist game and adjust accordingly**.

As I stated earlier, I believe those who operate within the law are also responsible for paying tax but as I understand it tax-dodging is not exclusive to those in the property sector.

&gt; Meanwhile, you have a place like Gràcia which is (or was) a residential area and not zoned for hotels and holiday apartments for a reason, and suddenly it's inundated with busloads of **bucket-and-spade** types on a cheap self-catering bender. 

Try not to get offensive. I've lived here long enough to know that Gracia apartments are not being rented to those coming for stag weekends, family beach holidays or those cliches were the Brits are demanding fish+chips+heinz baked beans.

&gt; Do they patronize the Catalan businesses? No, they shop at the Apus. They buy beer from the Moros who have been attracted by the new ""tourism"". And of course spend the nights shouting and pissing in the streets.

Pissing in the streets they learnt from the locals (albeit possibly not all Catalans). The other areas you think the tourists are not helping Catalunya's overall business are just capitalistic forces again. Don't hate the player, hate the game. (btw I probably prefer all the awesome food you can get in kibuka, samsara etc to anything the indian corner shops sell, although I will shop there if I need to as it is *convenient*.

&gt; I don't think those signs are passive aggressive. I think they're showing an impressive amount of restraint.

Restraint how?

&gt; On the other hand (surprise) the officials don't do anything about it, because that would require some effort on someone's part. It's not as if they don't have a handy list of all the offenders with contact information right there on the internet.

There are obviously many issues that the authorities have to deal with. Petty crime, organised crime and corruption (arguably) before they should be cracking down on those renting a spare room in their  apartment.

I appreciate anyone reading this far. I'm sure many of you are locals and I have to say you have a wonderful city. It's introduced me to people from all over the world and enhanced my belief that you should always look to integrate with local people when you travel. In the case of Barcelona I have taken that to mean Catalans and Spanish people as well as those that have settled here from other countries.

All of those people I have met want to see the city prosper but I don't think aiming to separate yourselves from the tourist industry **and** Spain at the same time will do you many favours (remember the Euro... that could cause greater destabilisation if you are left with it post-independence).

I think the grass-roots movements here have the right ideas. To talk about how to properly address the issues in a pro-active, immediate form while tackling those that are much larger and need to be addressed at a national / official level.

I'm not sure if you want to start another thread to get some of the politics of the situation in Barcelona aired and see how the conversation goes? Or is there a sub for that already?

Languages do influence the thoughts you have. A guy who grew up deaf in a remote village in south america, and was never taught sign language, can't grasp the concept of idea, and took him quite a bit to understand that things have names, and that it's due to everyone knowing the names that we can communicate (I can't seem to find the article, but it was probably in /r/linguistics that I read it).

It's not a difficult thought experiment; just imagine that every expression of feelings in your language had a connotation that showed sadness. You would feel sad using those words, the persons listening to you would think you're sad, and everyone would be sad.

Likewise, in translation, whenever english doesn't have a word that accurately depicts the idea being expressed, which happens not only in specific branches of knowledge but in common daily life language, it is a pain to find a word that resembles close enough, and your idea will still not be expressed adequately.

Languages die (http://magazine.worldofcomputing.net/news/india-lost-20-of-its-languages-in-50-years/) and it's not ok to let languages go to waste. You can read the linguists on the topic, the issues range from historical knowledge we no longer have access to, like the greek fire, to a loss of understanding the day to day of the people whenever the records don't focus on showing it, and archaeological evidence is amiss.

What authority is there for deciding a language isn't worth saving? That it is ok to never know the recipe of greek fire? How can we know it's worthless knowledge if we never had it?

It's a quite messy business to understand languages without live speakers; sometimes the knowledge is lost beyond recovery.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Personally I don't have an answer, but if I was to find one I'd go about it like this. 

I'd look into three different factors: Legality, economics and culture. 

Legality is all about whether legally people can move there. So for example if a country is a member of the EEA it will have free movement of people and almost open borders. There's also the question of whether there's a lot of legal restrictions tying you down once you live there. One of the Eastern countries (Bulgaria or Hungary, can't remember) has some weird stuff restricting whether students can leave if they get degree in Hungary. This comes to mind as an example.

Secondly economics. Basically, is there any chance of you finding a job? What sort of skills do you need to get a job? Are those skills easy to obtain? Is the cost of living too high? It's probably quite hard to consider this on a national scale because it varies so much inside countries. For example everything is more expensive in London than it is in Sheffield but there's also more and better work there. But you can try and untangle that piece of barbed wire and display the information in an informative manner. 

Lastly, culture. This ties into economics a fair bit. It concerns a lot of the same questions like what abilities must I have to live here? How hard is it to get those abilities (thinking of language here, but also other things)? Is there a problem with racism in the country? Is the problem severe *and* widespread enough for this to be a problem (discrimination on a government level, for instance). The questions are very similar to economics, but the outcome is different. It's less ""can I afford to live here"" and more ""will I be able to have a life here"" and ""will I be able to make friends here and have all the things which make life worth living"". 

These three factors are what will give you your conclusion. Hopefully people will discuss them :)",0,1376669573,null,0,false,0,cbp2bsu,t3_1khr1g,t1_cbp2bsu,t1_cbp1w0l,null,1429807166,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

You can write the information as a simple algorithm for making Greek fire or Inca knots, which is independent of language, and the information would be kept on forever. 

In terms of preserving feelings, I agree with you that each language has its nuances, its emotional tendencies, but all people are capable of having those feelings. I do not believe that a certain language 'owns' a certain emotion by being the only one capable of expressing it. It is people who have the full range of ideas and feelings which will eventually find their way in language. To make my point clearer, if English / a common language ""doesn't have a word that accurately depicts the idea being expressed"" now, it will, eventually. If people are capable of having an idea or feeling, they will find a way to express it in language.

No one can decide if a language is saved or not. Having a common language does not mean you are not allowed to speak your native / favourite language. People will ultimately decide if the language is worth saving, through practical or emotional reasoning.

I think, what most other Germans annoys the most about us, is that Bavarians tend to have a lot of confidence which sometimes borders on arrogance or is actually just plain arrogance. That foreigners think Bavaria = Germany doesn't help.

This arrogance comes from Tradition and Success. 

Sucess: Our educational system ist basically outdated, but it still produces the second best ratings in PISA or other ratings and our unemployment rate ist one of the lowest in Germany. Also we have the CSU which ensures us a disproportional amount of power in germany compared to the other ""Bundesländer"", because CSU-politicians behave like little girls who throw tantrums, if they don't get what they want. And usually they want the best for Bavaria on the expense of the other Bundesländer. That's why the people in Bavaria keep voting for them.

Tradition: There was Prussia in the North and Austria-Hungaria in the South-East. Bavaria was a small kingdom located between these two bigger brothers and didn't want to get consumed by either of them. So we developed a strong sense for our own tradition. We kind of isolated ourselves from the other germans and this is, in parts, still true today.

**RISPOSTA**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
La mia famiglia produce olio di oliva in toscana e lo vende (principalmente) in Italia e Germania.

Facciamo parte di un mercato di nicchia ad alta qualita' e prezzi relativamente alti quindi la situazione descritta non ci interessa particolarmente, ma *per quanto riguarda il mercato generale*, **e' vero** che la situazione della regolamentazione e controllo dell'olio di oliva e' veramente penosa...
(**Edit3**: non ci riguarda nel senso che in questa nicchia si combatte sulla qualita', ma la nicchia non riesce ad affermarsi e/o espandersi anche e specie per la presenza della contraffazione nel mercato degli olii commerciali che si tengono quindi troppo distanti da noi nei prezzi)

La situazione e' veramente disperata per 2 principali motivi:

* *Le denominazioni* che non vengono quasi mai rispettate dal produttore. (Una volta ottenuta la certificazione, il produttore fa un po' quello che vuole, mischiando olii di qualita' minore come quello di sansa o molto piu' spesso olii di semi per abbassarne l'acidita'). Fino alla regolamentazione del 2011 addirittura si poteva commerciare sotto la dicitura ""olio vergine di oliva"" un composto con un minimo di 30% di olio di oliva se non mi sbaglio... ([cliccate qui' per capire e tra l'altro informarVi sulla situazione attuale](http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Cittadino/Consigli/Tematici/Giorno+per+giorno/Andiamo+al+supermercato/02_supermercato.htm))

* *L'origine:* l'olio italiano e' piu' pregiato e quindi piu' costoso di quello delle nazioni limitrofe (Grecia, Marocco...). Dal 1 Luglio 2009 e' obbligatorio indicare l'origine delle olive se comunitarie o extra comunitarie. Comunque la maggior parte continua nella pratica senza cambiamenti sull'etichetta, importando legalmente o illegalmente e ricommerciando spesso come produzione locale. Non troverete numeri in internet ma vi posso assicurare che alcune regioni italiane arrivano ad ""produrre"" quasi il doppio della loro effettiva capacita' produttiva.

In sostanza il problema e' che in un modo o nell'altro l'italiano cerca sempre di arrangiarsi.
Se, a noi, che siamo italiani e produttori di olio arrivano proposte da parte di questi individui (interessati alla nostra rete di distribuzione) non oso immaginare cosa arrivi negli USA.. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
**APPENDICE**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finita 'sta pappardella sull'olio contraffatto ora parliamo di **qualità**: 

L'origine non e' una garanzia di qualita', come dire che il vino che stai bevendo e' fatto con uva italiana... ma se poi e' tavernello...

Come avviarsi verso la qualita' dall'etichetta:

Info obbligatorie:

- *denominazione*: olio extra vergine di oliva
- *sede* del produttore e del confezionatore (stabilimento e opzionalmente sede legale): in Italia
- *data di scadenza* :tenendo conto che la scadenza dell'olio e' circa a 18 mesi e che le olive si colgono a Novembre, fatevi i conti :)

Info facoltative (solitamente indice di qualita' :P):

- *DOP* o *IGP* ( con origine precisa delle olive)
- *Spremitura a freddo* o *estratto a freddo*
- *Acidita'*&lt; 0.4%
- *Polifenoli* &gt;150 mg/Kg(non sono sicuro di questa cifra perche' non ho molto idea di cosa si riesca a trovare nel mercato normale ma, su questo, chi piu' ne ha piu' ne metta!!**Edit:** [trovata tabella valori 2012 olii toscani](http://www.foodlab.it/notizie/analisi-olio-toscano-2012.html), tenete presente che state guardando olii totalmente su un altro livello rispetto all'olio da scaffale  e che e' stato un anno eccezionalmente basso per acidita')
- *Raccolto a mano* (**Edit2**non direttamente responsabile della qualita' dell'olio nella maggior parte dei casi, ma la raccolta a mano, in gergo *brucatura*, non causa alcun danno alla pianta e consente la raccolta delle olive sui teloni sottostanti senza la presenza di foglie, rami e impurita' in genere. Diversa puo' essere la situazione quando le olive vengono raccolte dando colpi e scossoni al tronco e ai rami con mezzi meccanici e/o mazze)

true,dreugeworst,NETH,The Netherlands,"The bit saying more complex, at least in nature, doesn't have to be the case. A different colour can confer an evolutionary advantage, but I wouldn't call it more complex. Nor does an evolutionary change have to be advantageous at all.

What I meant by direction is that there isn't a drive in evolution to make organisms more intelligent for example, which is something the evolution of man graphic implies.
The 'direction' of evolution is always conditioned on the environment of the organism, and even then for any given environment there are many niches an organism can inhabit, not one single 'better' direction.

For example, although humans are wildly successful, the Hominidae as a family aren't so much, especially compared to say ants, which have been estimated to make up between 15% and 25% of terrestrial animal biomass, and are present on most continents (except antarctica).

As for the OED definition: most biologists would argue that the second half of it is not true, at least since the modern evolutionary synthesis. There has been some debate over what would constitute evolutionary progress and how you would measure it, as well as whether it is a part of evolution at all. See also [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest-scale_trends_in_evolution). I personally dislike using the term to mean progress when not referencing biology, because it causes people to think that it means the same within biology.

Allow me to rephrase: There was never any non-crazy-lone-dude Green party in Greece. 

My point was that L14QU was throwing party names at random to make a point that all votes to GD were protest votes and that people don't accept GD's ideas. (actually more people flirt with GD's ideas that the 7 to 10% of their current voters).

He also mentions Syriza, which is absurd because Suriza was the only party to increase its voter base, not to lose it to GD (if anything, it managed to absorb voters from the other left wing parties who were protesting against their former homes, be it PASOK, DIMAR or KKE)

What might hold true is that GD was benefited by ND. As ND moved more and more to the right (by using GD-like rhetoric), GD became the logical next step for those voters. Not a protest, and not extreme in their eyes. ",0,1376677791,null,0,false,0,cbp5jkd,t3_1khqvr,t1_cbp5jkd,t1_cbp47wq,null,1429805666,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Basically small time delinquents feel they have immunity, because each time they get caught they're left off with a suspended sentence. They have no incentive to stop their ways, to stop mugging people and all, because they'll just spend a night in jail, and go to court which gives them some suspended sentence, maybe at best they get a fine. I'm okay with suspended sentences for non-violent crimes, but there are actual muggers who get suspended sentences here, and a mugging could easily cause serious injury if not death. They're just lucky they didn't kill anybody during a mugging. It's pure chance that their mugging ""went well"". If it turned dirty and someone got killed they'd get a real prison sentence.

I'm pro Spanish clubs but i really think Real Madrid made all the right moves in the off season. Barcelona's defense remains shaky which is why i think when it comes down to the wire they will outlast Barca. I also think Martinez might not be ready to take the torch with one of the best teams to ever play the game.

And yet all the problems about Keynesianism are also true. Namely that all the classic Keynesian economic tools are without effect or impossible in our situation.

We've lowered central bank interest rates to record lows and we have not the ability to take on massive debt to do the big spending program that would be required to lift us out again because we didn't lower our debt in good times. 

And even if Germany, Netherlands and Finland could borrow unlimited money there is not the political foundation for these kinds of programs because we are not politically united. Without support among the population you can't do anything like that anyway. It will fail and create bitterness and resentment.

But Atletico finished strongly last year, and yeah they lost Falcao but Villa is a fantastic short-term replacement, another player I think Barca will regret losing. They handled Madrid well in the Copa Del Rey final beating them for the first time in like a decade or so I believe, and Simeone is much more established than Martino and has clearly found a great system to use with his team. Barca had a horrid end to the season (for Barca), and had they not such a sizable gap from early on it might have been a much closer season. I think it's also that time after time you are seeing clubs that most would expect Barca to walk over, such as Celtic, who have figured out how to outlast Barca's system and exploit them with decisive counterattacks. I think the defeat to Munich was pretty indicative the stale atmosphere that was happening in the Barca room last year.

The real issue is what Barcelona is coming to be associated with. Cities need tourism and Barcelona is not exempt. What Barcelona doesn't need is to be associated as a cheap place to come and party, while also getting look at pretty cultural shit. It's what happened to Prague and that city is now unbearable during peak tourist season. 

It doesn't matter if the people who are renting their apartments are guiris or Catalans - I work in the sector and I promise there are plenty of both. We're in tough financial times and people are looking for a way to make extra money. Plus, it's a great way to travel. I much prefer it to renting a hotel and I am sure many others do too - I am sure that many people who chose airbnb or similar think that they are actually helping by not being ""typical"" tourists who stay in hotels. 

What needs to stop is glamorizing everything and making it so goddamn kitsch. Horse drawn carriages? Get the fuck outta here with that bullshit. Why is seeing La Rambla the #1 to do every time that Barcelona is mentioned? It's something that is so hyped up for absolutely no reason - and why?? Everyone would have to see it anyways as it's *right in the middle* of the fucking city.

This is an amazing city with a lot to offer to a lot of different kinds of people, but the city really has to be careful about what kind of reality they are helping to promote if we want to cull the hoards of lobster-skinned ignoramuses.

In Yugoslavia, we as a nation got or vastly expanded our own universities, many national political &amp; cultural institutions,... almost the whole apparatus of an European nation. Women got voting rights and equality, once a heavily rural country had been industrialized and modernized very fast.

And for me personaly... I am glad that some the values of that times are with us even today. We are one of the most egalitarian societies in the world. 

(OECD: "" Inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient is lowest in **Slovenia, Denmark and Norway**"")

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; I do understand that there still is a very high number of people who suffer from depression and high suicide and alcoholism rates, despite good public services and ranking high on happiest country indexes. Can anyone explain this? Is it the long winters?

I don't have an explanation. Reasons for someone commiting suicide or becoming an alcoholic are variable and complex and I don't believe there exists a single simple explanation.

But here's some numbers.

The suicide rate in Finland has been on a declining trend for decades and is lowest in over 40 years ([see stats](http://stat.fi/til/ksyyt/2011/ksyyt_2011_2012-12-21_kat_006_en.html)). In 2011 the rate was 16.1 which is about 1.6 times the EU average of 10.2, about 6th highest in the EU, and about 20th highest in world. It's still higher than the EU average, but not exceptionally high and is declining.

The alcohol consumption in Finland is below EU average, and according to the data Finns are generally not heavy drinkers compared to other EU countries. Yet some Finns do drink hard: about 10% of Finns consume about 50% of all alcohol. I do not know the rate of alcoholism in Finland or in the EU for comparison, but one could safely say that some of those 10% are alcoholics. 

In 2011 alcohol related diseases and accidental poisoning by alcohol were the 6th common cause of death with 3.7% of all deaths. Alcohol mortality has been on a decline yet is still the leading cause of death among the subgroup of working age men.

Both issues you mentioned are problems but not as big as one often hears, and are declining. I think the accessibility of intervention and treatment services is crucial in alleviating those. One big problem is that alcoholism bears a heavy social stigma here, and that may lead problem drinkers to deny and to hide their problem rather than to seek support and help to address it.",0,1376692072,null,0,false,0,cbpaub5,t3_1k0rlt,t1_cbpaub5,t1_cbktlbw,null,1429803122,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,metroxed,EUSK,Basque Country,"&gt;How do you think you will be able to promote Basque as a viable language in the future? Will there be other people trying to learn the language? Will it remain isolated to the Basque country?

It is unrealistic to believe it will ever extend beyond the Basque Country, but at the same time it is not something one should expect, and no one does. So it is safe to say it will, with all certainty, be isolated to the Basque Country, because there is no real use of it outside. But yes inside.

The Basque language is being promoted in many ways; the public education, for example, offers Basque-only education from preschool level to higher education. In the degree I'm doing, the Basque class more than triples the students of the Spanish gruop. Public healthcare guarantees (at least to a certain level) that public attention (from nurses, doctors, etc.) can be given to you in Basque. The objective of the Basque government is to be able to live a fully Basque life in the Basque Country, without the need to use Spanish if you don't wish to. And it is giving results; the level of Basque usage has stopped decreasing in two of the three provinces where its protection policies have been implemented and is actually increasing in one (the other four provinces, unfortunately, do not have in place any policy). 

I believe it *is* a viable language in the future, but for us. Just like Finnish is a viable language for the Finns and Maltese is a viable language for the Maltese. It is part of us and our identity, and we should not let it die.

For one, you have to be careful in what you legalise. I hate the term 'legalise drugs' (or terms along those lines), because, for one, there are already drugs legal, and we (or at least I) don't want all drugs legalised. Things like marijuana, or some other class B/C drugs, sure, but I'm not too sure on stuff like cocaine or crystal meth, as I think they can do serious damage to people and families and are highly addicted (but alcohol can be as well, so I don't know).

Secondly, there is a lot more money behind some drugs than others. Marijuana, for example, can be easily grown at home for recreational use. This means that if one country legalised, they would be less likely to become a base of operations for violent drug gangs, as there isn't much money in it. Cocaine, however, has a lot of money in it, as it is more difficult to grow and make. This means that if one country did legalise it, you would have them become a target for big gangs. 

And finally, I don't think legalisation would happen anyway with only one country, especially only one country within the EU. As you agreed earlier, if Spain legalised some drugs, the borders with other countries would shut pretty quickly. We wouldn't see legalisation of many drugs within a single EU country, it would have to be across many of them, lessening the effects of crime because of it.",0,1376695197,null,0,false,0,cbpbvxs,t3_1khhyi,t1_cbpbvxs,t1_cbpbl8s,null,1429802636,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

or you know, just go with guilty until proven innocent

Yeah, some people might still smuggle drugs, but so what, that already happens under the current system.

Another reason why I'm scared of the US: people like this get to vote on who has the nuclear red button... But what most americans don't usually get is: your guns are no threat.

Anybody can be silenced by anybody through force or by giving them enough money. What I'm talking about is silencing through ""laws"". Read what I said, I was careful to phrase it right.

I don't read other reddits... well, except technology. So I'll have to believe you when you say people write some weird shit... I really like it when people call other people crazy just because their ideas are not mainstream.
