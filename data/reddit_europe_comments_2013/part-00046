true,Lizard,null,null,"Wow, we're arriving at pretty subtle nuances of the German language. Both of you are not quite correct, but your ideas are not exactly wrong, either. I'll explain it to the best of my ability, but it might be a bit vague. As you know, language is notoriously complicated and likes to avoid being pinpointed by exact definitions... and I'm not a linguist, after all. Also, we are entering the field of colloquial speech here, so take with a grain of salt as regional differences may apply (e.g. natives of certain geographic regions might say ""Am Lesen dran"" rather than ""Am Lesen"").

""Beim Lesen"" (remember the m, it's important) is used when something else is happening during the process that's describes, so it can be translated as ""while reading"" or ""as he was reading"". For instance, ""Beim Lesen summte er ein Lied vor sich hin"".

""Am Lesen"" is used in similar contexts to mean essentially the same thing, but always goes with ""sein"" and because of that can be used independent from a second activity as well. So you could say ""Er war am Lesen als er plötzlich ein Geräusch hörte"", or you could just state ""Er war am Lesen"". To express the original ""He sat there reading"", you could say ""Er saß da und war am Lesen"" (though as I said, ""Er saß da und las"" would sound a tad more intuitive to a native speaker - you could say ""Da saß er und war am Lesen"" though, this would be a natural way to express something like ""And there he was, just sitting there reading a book"").

Now this is where it gets complicated: You can also leave the ""sein"" (or in this case, the ""war"") implied and end up with something like WailingFungus suggested: ""Da saß er, am Lesen und ganz in das Buch vertieft"". It doesn't work without the comma, though, and you can't just leave half a sentence after that comma, so ""Er saß da, am Lesen"" would not work.",0,1362856269,null,0,false,0,c8sof0g,t3_19yuvi,t1_c8sof0g,t1_c8snm9p,null,1431533612,8,false,GermanPractice,t5_2t7fs,8

marcia su Roma e golpe... aldilà che i golpe li fanno i militari e in totale segretezza, mentre la marcia su Roma fu una manifestazione pubblica e ampiamente propagandata... insurrezione armata? sicuramente i manganelli sono un'arma, ma non fu sparato un solo colpo e versata una sola goccia di sangue anche se avevano, qualcuno, qualche schioppo della prima guerra mondiale! la “marcia” fu essenzialmente una parata che ed influì minimamente sulle sorti politiche dell’Italia! io lo chiamerei un'auto-golpe!!! cerco di essere meno prolisso possibile... il presidente del consiglio, tale Facta e ombra del Giolitti che già a quel tempo era vecchio ed assente, s'illuse che una possibile marcia su Roma era oramai tramontata e su queste convinzioni riferì al Re... il consiglio dei ministri allora propose al Re di dichiarare lo stato di assedio, visto che le notizie erano di tutt'altro avviso, ma il Re non diede mai l'assenso! perché? diciamo che anche se i giolittiani erano una componente forte in parlamento, non lo erano a sufficienza per imporre una qualsiasi cosa, mentre il peso dei Fascisti a quel periodo, a livello popolare, incuteva paura e sapevano che se si facevano elezioni avrebbero preso sin da subito forza (ricordiamo Montanelli che diceva su quel periodo : il successo del fascismo era non solo tra i capitalisti e gli agrari, ma anche tra la piccola e media borghesia e persino tra alcune fette del proletariato)!!! dobbiamo anche ricordare che in quel periodo il governo era in piena crisi a tal punto che si sono fatti 2 esecutivi nel giro di 3 mesi... nel mentre Mussolini cercò di accellerare i tempi ed a Napoli, al teatro San Carlo, tenne un discorso di forte contrasto che fu applaudito anche da Benedetto Croce e da lì inizio la mobilitazione... il Re s'incavolò con Facta pronunciando la frase, riportata sui giornali, “E ora, bisogna che uno di noi si sacrifichi”, seguito dalle dimmisioni immediate di Facta! ma come si giunse al conferimento dell’incarico allo stesso Mussolini?? semplice... il Re conferì l’incarico con una sua la lista dei Ministri che era già pronta,  di questa compagine i fascisti erano solo tre!!! in questo nuovo governo erano rappresentati, oltre ai 3 Fascisti, tutte le forze parlamentari, eccetto socialisti e comunisti. In pratica fu un governo che oggi definiremmo di larghe intese... ed in Parlamento Mussolini incassò la piena fiducia data anche da persone di rilievo ovvero Enrico De Nicola, Giovanni Gronchi, Alcide De Gasperi, lo stesso Giolitti, Salandra, Bonomi, Orlando e pure Facta! perché??? per il semplice motivo che avevamo uno stato allo sfascio ed in totale disfacimento istituzionale oltre a gravissimi problemi sociali dei più elementari e tutti furono contenti di darlo a Mussolini! anche Luigi Pirandello, Guglielmo Marconi e Giuseppe Ungaretti videro di buon occhio il nuovo governo!!! Mussolini, a soli 38 anni, ottenne quindi l’incarico di formare il suo governo non in virtù di una manifestazione di piazza, seppur massiccia e ben organizzata, bensì in forza delle sue capacità di mediazione politica e di coinvolgimento sociale che lo indicavano come l’unico in grado di reggere le sorti del paese in quel difficile momento storico.

Matteotti... ti dirò, mi sono abbastanza interessato del caso, visto che oltre ad essere molto vicino alle zone, la mia famiglia abitava proprio di fianco alla famiglia Matteotti, ma anche per alcune anomalie che non riuscivo a capire, avendo conosciuto anche i componenti dell'altra parte e vedendo il rapporto fra loro!!! ergo, sarò ancora meno prolisso perché visto che conosco abbastanza bene la questione altrimenti mi dilungherei senza volerlo (ed inizio ad essere pesante!), perciò ti metterò alcuni quesiti in modo che se tu vorrai potrai approfondire... dalla storia ufficiale ne deriva che un certo Aldo Finzi (fra le tante imprese in ogni settore fu celebre quella con D'Annunzio su Vienna, vice segretario agli interni del periodo Fascista, uccise Matteotti che fra l'altro erano delle stesse zone e che si conoscevano (infatti ebbero rapporti insieme su alcune questioni sociali del Polesine... strano ma vero...) quando il Matteotti fece il famoso discorso che fantomaticamente fu la causa illusa del suo omicidio, ti devi domandare per qual motivo doveva essere ucciso quando bastava un semplice controllo, quando lo stesso Finzi aveva non solo dalla sua un'oratorio ben più allargata per controbattere, ma aveva possibilità di potere sia istituzionale che proprio che in 2 mosse il Matteotti poteva farlo diventare uno dei classici falliti senza farlo diventare il martire su una sciocchezza? perché la famiglia Matteotti con suo figlio in testa non accusavano il Fascismo ma il Re per questioni affaristiche di petrolio??? la famiglia Matteotti e Gino Finzi (il fratello che ebbi modo di parlare più volte e pure riuscii ad avere una registrazione di 4 ore sul caso datomi da una giornalista di appartenenza comunista che scriveva in varie testate Unità compresa anche se con nomi fasulli, poiché aldilà dell'amicizia che avevamo sapeva che m'interessavo del caso ed è sempre stata molto aperta con me visto che mi faceva notare sempre i punti cardine che ci legava piuttosto che quelli che ci divideva) non li ho mai visti odiarsi, anzi, in qualche situazione mi ricordo che vennero mentre ero con Finzi a domandare altre informazioni, magari sfuggite, per capire qualcosa di più... sfortunatamente Gino sa solo dalle lettere che Aldo gli spediva in quel periodo... Aldo non diede le dimmissioni per il caso Matteotti ma a causa di una frangia interna che stava destabilizzando il partito Fascista! poi ti ricordo che il stesso Aldo Finzi, che partecipò anche alla marcia su Roma (hai presente lo smoking di Mussolini all'incarico dato dal Re? bene... hai visto che era palese che non era il suo... bene... era di Aldo Finzi) andò a morire come partigiano ebreo alle Fosse Ardeatine, anche se fu nascosto inizialmente nelle case di più Fascisti, dopo il confino, ed in quella dello stesso Duce (3 mesi)...

in quello che dici sulle tessere c'è una inesattezza... da principio, quando si instaurò il governo Fascista, furono vietate nuove iscrizioni! ed ha una sua logicità (per non consentire l'iscrizione a chi voleva salire sul carro vincente!!!), poi molto più tardi la tessera era automatica, ovvero rilasciata a tutti, ma ci si poteva rifiutare!!! e vero che nel momento ti rifiutavi venivi additato e sicuramente controllato, ma non per privarti del mangiare o qualcos'altro, altrimenti facevi la parte dell'opposizione... uno dei divieti che avevi era il divieto di scrivere sui giornali come ""redattore"", ma non come ""collaboratore""... un giornalista inglese che venne in quei periodi fece un'inchiesta, ovvero domandò le varie appartenenze politiche del popolo e si sentì rispondere ""Si puo' contare che in Italia ci siano, fra massimalisti, riformisti, ecc., un 25 per cento di socialisti, un altro 25 per cento di clericali, un 15 di conservatori, un 10 di repubblicani, un altro dieci di..."". ""Ma allora, aveva obiettato, i fascisti...?"" si era sentito rispondere: ""Che c' entra? Fascisti sono tutti""...

con questo ti posso dire che il Fascismo non è privo di colpe, anzi ne ha di gravissime, ma non si può buttare tutto all'aria vedendolo come il male assoluto per questo... il Fascismo è stato un periodo storico che non deve essere restaurato ma nemmeno rinnegato, sia nel male ma sopratutto nel bene che ha fatto, vista il periodo particolare! io non sono Fascista anche perché sono quasi tutti già morti e gli ultimi in vita hanno venerande età... di certo l'avanguardia creatasi in quel periodo e l'evoluzione ideale è da non prendere alla leggera, perché fra i sbagli e le buone cose c'è sempre da imparare! anche da altre dittature c'è da imparare, anche dalla dittatura della democrazia c'è da imparare!!!",0,1362856412,null,0,false,0,c8sogdl,t3_19x6d7,t1_c8sogdl,t1_c8shjco,null,1431533634,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

true,TuEsiAs,null,null,"One of the most important aspect of the common agricultural policy which people always forget about is rural development. I'll just copy/paste the excerpts from European Commission on CAP.

**Rural development** – measures to help farmers modernise their farms and become more competitive while protecting the environment, and to keep rural communities thriving. These payments are part financed by the member countries, and account for some 20% of the CAP's budget. 

Over 77% of the EU's territory is classified as rural (47% is farm land and 30% forest) and is home to around half its population (farming communities and other residents).


In the context of the EU and the CAP, rural development seeks to safeguard the vitality of the countryside by supporting programmes to invest, modernise and support activity – both agricultural and non-agricultural – in rural areas.


At the moment, EU countries set their own priorities for rural development, but must spend at least 10% of their budget on making their farming and forestry sectors more competitive, at least 25% on improving the environment and the countryside and at least 10% on diversifying the rural economy.


Today, rural development policy helps not only farmers but also other people participating in the rural economy such as forest owners, farm workers, small businesses, local NGOs, etc.


Each rural development programme must include action to protect and improve the EU's natural resources and landscapes in rural areas.
Rural development money is given in exchange and as compensation for action that protects and preserves the EU countryside, and that helps fight climate change, including

* preserving water quality 

* sustainable land management 

* planting trees to prevent erosion and floods.

* Generally more powers for the EP which may or may not stem from ability to introduce legislation
* Reform of the treaty change system which requires consensus as opposed to a simple majority or 'super majority' to amend
* More transparency
* Getting a better ethic of democracy. The thing about the constituents emails being delete comes to mind here. Enough of that sort of stuff happens for the EU's reputation to be seriously undermined.
* Improve referendum and/or petitioning systems.

This is just what I could come up with in 10 minutes. I'm not an expert on the EU, but I am reasonably knowledge for a lay person. If I knew more I could probably double or triple this list. 

Edit: I'd like to add that as European citizens and/or Europhiles, it's very good that we come to terms with the problems of the EU rather than mindlessly hating it or mindlessly supporting it (an awful lot of people do both of those). 'Pro Europe, Pro Reform!' to take words from Nick Clegg. There are clearly issues with the EU and any one who claims there are no problems what so ever is extremely blind in more than just sight. Things can always be improved and as members of the electorate its our jobs to support such improvements and let it hold however small a level of sway in the way we vote.

It's a community. People come here to engage each other, debate and learn, sometimes vent, sometimes laugh, sometimes looking for OC and kill time. Not all want to come to spread hate, lie and troll. One of the great aspects behind reddit is that it is very human. People share stories, real or not, often intimate parts of their life's and their communities. That is actually great and unlike other social media sites. You propose to control the discussion of certain issues that you might feel sensitive to. That won't change or clear anyone's mind and certainly won't be cathartic in regards to those same sensitive subjects. Talking about these issues openly and without fear is, as I said before, psychology 101 and thus highly recommended.

There is a very subjective line in regards to xenophobia. I have seen xenophobia in disguise by many here.

They have been founded with the intention of providing cheap living space for their members. Even if you are not a member but an Azubi or student you might be abled to move in to one of their apartments without having to buy the Genossenschaftsanteile.

e.g. mine allowed me to move in WITHOUT a Kaution but only with a Zeitmietvertrag and providing proof of my student status.
Zeitmietvertrag means that you have the right to live in an appartment from day X until day Y. If you do not come to an agreement with your landlord before day Y concerning a prolongation of the contract you must move out. On the other hand if you want to move out before day Y you will most likely get stuck with finding another person that wants to live in your place after you move out since you basically signed a contract that guarantees the landlord that rent will be paid for the length of the Zeitmietvertrag.

Since I found a job in the same town later on and I didn't move to another place I am now a member of the Genossenschaft. The Genossenschaftsanteile are being paid by installments which leaves me in the comfortable position of not having ""to cough up"" at least 3 cold rents in advance but paying an amount we both agreed on for 16 months. There is a possible downside though: If I should ever fall behind on my payments the whole remaining amount becomes due immediately and I have no clue what will happen if I cant pay then.

Personally I have come to the conclusion that the Genossenschaft is the best landlord I ever had (having rented appartments from five different landlords) but since I only ""know"" my Genossenschaft I don't want to  generalize this statement.

- If you're looking for a cool (albeit somewhat pricey) place to eat for dinner, ""Relais de l'entrecote"" is a place that serves literally just side salads, steaks, and fries. The waiter asks how you want your steak cooked and what you would like to drink; that's the only conversation you have with him. The food is fantastic, too--way worth it. And they have a bunch of locations, so it's pretty easy to fit into your day.

It's a beer bar, plain and simple: high ceiling with big wooden tables and a menu full of beer. Their draft prices are not too shabby, and they're a great choice if you're looking for a more quiet, conversational place to go.  The other bar, Shywawa, is in Saint Michel, not far from Notre Dame and Shakespeare &amp; Co. I fucking love this place. Wherever my friends and I went on the weekends, we always ended up at Shywawa for beer, cocktails, or beer cocktails. They're open until nearly sunrise, they have a fantastic music selection, and it's the kind of crowded, fun bar I'd take my brother to if he came out to see me.

- Another option is just to walk the streets. Rue Mouffetard is a wonderful place to be, full of students, shops, and bars. If you're looking more specifically for that nightlife feeling, Bastille is a great district to wander (but it's by no means cheap).

So Germany and other northern EU countries could export heavy machinery and ships to developing countries. Also, so that European companies could outsource production abroad with cheaper land and cheaper labor costs. 

Now that energy costs are driving food prices, we are a nation dependent of foreign food importation, which aggravates the deficit in an already dire economic scenario. The argument is that we were dumb saps who failed to develop with the funds given. And I agree with that. We were indeed poor saps.  

Prior to the EU, we were a food independent country. We didn't  depend on European markets. Our fishing fleets were active and productive. Maybe too much productive.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Additionally the aid we send them may be severely adding to this problem in that we flood their markets with wheat at the first hint of a hunger scare for free. No Kenyan farmers could possibly compete with this and thus, they go out of business.

This might happen when the food does reach them. A lot of the times, the aid we do send is kept by their corrupt leaders who then sell it back to whomever pays the most.

&gt;This is a more controversial view and I'm not fully sure I believe in it as I'm not an economist and this seems to be an issue for them.

If we were to flood their markets with cheap agricultural goods, it would only benefit them (just like we'd also benefit if we allowed them to flood ours).

Yes, the Kenyan farmer that couldn't compete would lose its job but their population would have more income to spend and would be able to spend more of it on other goods other than agricultural products.

That logic of ""we must not allow the goods of foreign competitors into our countries otherwise we might lose our job"" is dead and long gone, that has a name and it's protectionism - a source of poverty (as it increases prices for the consumer) and conflict (as disconnected economies make warring much less expensive, the costs of conflict in that case don't involve going against the business interests of many national citizens).

If you really want to protect the employment of the farmer or whomever and ignore the costs that will have on the final consumer, you might just as well argue against the usage or tractors or oxen in agriculture as technological progress and mechanisation (much like international trade) also reduced employment in the sectors affected by it.

The argument sort of goes along the lines of protectionism for a short time, only so long as the economy can really get going. Anyway, it's not even full blown protectionism. The reasons for the protectionism are to stop overwhelming price volatility. If oil one week is going to be 10 pence and the next it's going to be £100, it's going to make investing very difficult. In a lot of instances countries do still put up these protectionism tarrifs to avoid such effects of the free market.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;From my understanding of this, it's not so much about protectionism as about allowing the economies in these countries to grow.

Their economies would grow with fewer restrictions on international trade. Restricting trade to benefit the producer would harm the consumer and would be a net loss for the nation.

Look at Hong Kong, [they have full free trade and they don't even have arable land](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Hong_Kong)!

&gt;At the moment most African countries can't even really get a basic economy down for all sorts of reasons.

Of course not, we and so many others restrict trade from them!

&gt;The argument sort of goes along the lines of protectionism for a short time, only so long as the economy can really get going.

Yeah, I've heard that argument. It's flawed in that it ignores the cost imposed on consumer, it assumes that once everything is in place it will survive the liberalisation of trade and it pretends that new profitable industries can't prop up without governmental protection. That's a load of nonsense.

&gt;Anyway, it's not even full blown protectionism.

It's only half as shitty but it's still shitty.

&gt;The reasons for the protectionism are to stop overwhelming price volatility. If oil one week is going to be 10 pence and the next it's going to be £100, it's going to make investing very difficult. In a lot of instances countries do still put up these protectionism tarrifs to avoid such effects of the free market.

The same thing can be said about the domestic market. You could ban all imports and prices could still be volatile. Regardless, price controls don't work and the freest economies are also the wealthiest so I reject that notion that some restrictions might be good, they're not, they're only a myth arising from the special interest groups that want to lobby for ever increasing government support at the expense of everybody else.

&gt;Anyway, I'm not really advocating this policy. I try and avoid getting strong opinions on economics as I think I and most people really don't understand it at all.

I think you're doing great, I for one love debating these issues :p

&gt;I know I've made this argument poorly, please, forgive me.

This proposal aims to give more equality between fathers and mothers, and help the parity of career and salary between sexes.

Hollande proposed to reduce the parental leave to 2.5 years maximum, and force the remaining 6 months to be taken by the second parent. So for the first kid, both parents could stop for 6 months; for the next kids, the ""first parent"" (the mother usually) could take 2.5 years, and the other 6 months (instead of 3 years for the first).

Oh hi there new world order.

We don't need to dissolve countries, we should have a directly elected President, lower house (parliament) and upper house (senate) and then get rid of local governments, and just have the European Parliament give instructions to local regions.

We need someone to take the pressure and to blame when things go wrong, like the US has Obama. At the moment, in the EU the blame gets passed around and noone is really accountable. Too many elections, decision makers and bureaucracy. This is what is frustrating people and causing the massive anti-EU feelings in countries which feel ignored or suffering.

Also we should have a unified EU set of institutions, such as police force, army, navy, airforce, customs and border patrol, air traffic control and regulators etc etc. We should also have a central EU tax collector, this is very important, similar to how the US has the IRS.

Individual regions should be able to maintain their own cultural differences, such as local laws and local police and local business rules and taxes such as US states have. This means people in the Netherlands could still smoke weed for example, and Ireland could keep it's lower rate of VAT.",0,1362864352,null,0,1362864826,0,c8sqh69,t3_19z8g3,t1_c8sqh69,t1_c8sng6y,null,1431534583,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

They will introduce this new UK Bill of Rights, then scrap the Human Rights Act afterwards.

The UK Bill of Rights will be more powerful than the Human Rights Act, and will enshrine into our highest law (above all other laws), the right to things such as free speech, the right to religion and more importantly freedom from religion, it will also say what the police can and can't do to a person and a whole load of other things. It will include everything from the Human Rights Act and more, so there's no need to be concerned, and it will be more easily invoked, so you'll be able to say to a police officer American style ""I know my rights, please get lost"" if they want to search you without a warrant etc.

I have to actually say, it looks quite good on paper, and there was an open consultation on the government website for the whole of last year where normal members of the public could suggest what they wanted to see in it, and now an equal sized cross party group of MP's from all parties is looking over the submissions and drafting the bill before it goes before parliament. It will be introduced soon. It includes some neat protections which normal public people suggested that you don't get protected by in the Human Rights Act, you guys should check it out.

The reason the government is doing this, and all parties agree, is that whilst the Human Rights Act is great, it was sort of sewn into existing laws in a rather messy way (we have literally millions of laws going back nearly a millenium in the UK), and so they want to introduce a Bill of Rights which American style will stamp itself above everything else and be the highest law in the land. No ifs, no buts, no conflicts of interest with existing laws which people can use to abuse your rights, it will be the golden standard and held by courts above all other laws. At the moment your human rights can be easily abused and used against you by other people wishing to take you to court because the laws have all sorts of conflicts and issues, they aren't currently universal, and that's what the government is trying to achieve.

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"You're mistaking the European Council and the Council of The European Union (Council of Ministers). This is entirely understandable because the people who named them are retarded.

The European Council is the body made up of the 27 heads of government. Yes, they are representatives of the people, but most of them are directly elected by a small constituency in their country, rather than being directly elected by their entire electorate. The European Council has in the past decade or so sidelined the Commission by delving into very specific policy detail and expecting the Commission to follow through with it. The European Council meet in secret, the reason being that it is thought to make it more likely for leaders to concede on certain issues. If they were public, it would remain a game of political posturing in order to score approval and popularity in their own country.

The Council of the European Union is the meetings of the relevant government ministers from each country. For example, there is a council for Economics and Finance (Ecofin) that is composed of the finance minister from each country. The Council of the European Union is essentially the upper house, in that they have codecision with the Parliament. It is not a directly elected body.

The democratic deficit is often misunderstood. People hear it and they assume it means the EU is undemocratic. This is not the case, since the main EU institutions are linked to the democratic process in some manner. The problem is that they are too far removed from the electorate, thus leaving room for improvement.

The fact that this whole debate is being fueled by Conservatives who don't want the rights currently incorporated by the HRA to be there that seems incredibly unlikely to me. If a new bill of rights were to mirror and surpass the ECHR then it can be applied in addition to the ECHR. There's no need to repeal. 

Germany has a constitution whose rules on human rights are so strict they prohibit lazer tag because it simulates killing and is therefore an affront to human dignity (C-36/02 Omega v Oberbürgermeisterin der Bundesstadt Bonn). Any Germans are invited to correct me if i'm wrong. That exists alongside the ECHR and is more stringent. How we don't have to be that stringent but national codification of human rights does not require the repeal of any other legislation. There's no harm in doubling up.

Hell what if your military strategist have great interest in starting a gigantic useless war? Doesn't such scenario sound plausible.

I think our agricultural specialist would be greatly in favor of more subsidies for the CAP too.

As far as I know the EU has a lot of think tanks, gets tons of reports made and all by people who are adequately schooled in their field of interest. All that info is then nicely presented to the ""bureaucrats"" and they decide.

 I don't think there's any country that actually only lets engineers decide on the laws on engineering and so on. Maybe there was some communist country that did that I don't really know.

Polls =/= direct democracy. Hell even important referenda were ignored in the past in a number of EU countries.

Su questo inizio ad avere dei dubbi. Ho l'impressione che, adesso che molte barriere sono cadute e che la libertà di circolazione e di scambio è arrivata forse al suo massimo livello, stiamo vedendo quali sono i difetti di questo sistema. Per sua natura il capitalismo tende a concentrare il capitale: un capitalista che riesce nel suo intento accumula sempre più capitale 'risucchiandolo' dal sistema. E ora che il sistema è diventato globale questo meccanismo funziona con la sua massima capacità. Negli ultimi anni chi era ricco è diventato esponenzialmente più ricco, mentre tutti gli altri sono diventati più poveri: [negli USA l'1% della popolazione possiede il 40% della ricchezza](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM) e in molti altri paesi l'andamento si avvia ad essere simile.

Sempre meno persone controllano sempre di più: le multinazionali dell'alimentazione, della chimica e dell'informazione si contano con una mano, e non c'è un modo per cui qualcuno possa 'sfidarle', cosa che dovrebbe essere il meccanismo di equilibrio del capitalismo.

Per non parlare poi dei meccanismi di 'alta finanza' per cui si spostano somme ingentissime da una parte all'altra senza aver prodotto o fatto niente di tangibile, ma con grandi cambiamenti nei patrimoni.

Non so, di certo non sono un esperto di economia, ma mi pare che stiamo continuando a gettare l'acqua fuori bordo con una paletta mentre c'è una falla nella stiva. Cosa succederà quando non sarà più possibile 'risucchiare' capitali? Qual è il meccanismo di controllo che impedisce a pochissimi di avere sempre di più? Se la ricchezza viene portata tutta in paradisi fiscali, in che modo avviene la ridistribuzione attraverso le tasse?

true,Reilly616,EURO,European Union,"Well, I think the current steps are good, but not far enough. Before the next election, each Europarty will elect it's Candidate for the Commission Presidency (PES has already organised a system of democratic primaries). This will mean that we go into the election knowing who will be the President of the European Commission if Party X or Y wins the Parliament election. This is the same system as in a Parliamentary democracy (the Westminster system) and will mean that the Commission President becomes a true Prime Minister of the EU. 

I prefer this idea to a directly elected President for three main reasons. Firstly, the vast majority of EU Member States follow this system (only one is a Presidential Republic, and two are Semi-Presidential); it is therefore the European tradition and the formula which most citizens are familiar with. Secondly, I find it a dangerous prospect to give one person such a huge mandate as a direct election would imply. We can see the sort of dangers involved in that system when we look to our American cousins. Thirdly, and following on from the first two points, a Parliamentary system allows for a true coalition Government, wherein there is a balance of power. The President would need a real majority, not just a plurality, and Party positions would be tempered by the junior coalition Party/Parties. This helps to prevent the formation of a Government which proposes and passes whatever legislation it wants without true debate/compromise.

This said, I would like the system to move further towards a true Westminster system. The Commission need not have one member from each Member State. Think of your own Country. Is there a Minister from every County/Region/Land/Prefecture? Most likely not. Is this a problem? Most likely not. 

I would like to see the entire Commission elected from the ranks of MEPs. I realise that this is not in line with the traditions of every Member State, but it would ensure legitimacy. 

The Parliament and the Senate (see below) should each have the right to initiate legislation. It should not be limited to the executive. I think this point is self-explanatory.

The Council of the European Union should be replaced by a European Senate. The Senators would represent the views of their respective Member States. I am not certain either way whether there should be an equal number of Senators for each Member State (as with the US) or a form of degressive proportionality, albeit with smaller States more represented than they are in the Parliament (as with Germany).

I see no place in a reformed EU for the European Council. The members of the current European Council should stick to running their respective Member State (as with US Governors). If it is felt that there must be a role for these Heads of State or Government, then I would like to see that only in an advisory capacity, with no official EU-wide powers.

I would be comfortable with there being a figurehead President of the EU (remember, the President of the Commission would be the Prime Minister of the EU), but I wouldn't consider it an absolute necessity. It would of course be a useful post, in case there were trouble in forming a Government. The direct election of this President (Head of State of the EU) could be seen as giving him/her too much legitimacy as opposed the EU-PM. This is not a problem if the President's powers are very limited and strictly reserve. Indeed, such legitimacy could be seen as a final check on Government power by an office directly legitimised by the population at large. This is how it works in Ireland, and it works well. If this is seen as objectionable by too many, then of course the President could be elected by a Joint Assembly of the Parliament and Senate.


**TL;DR**: 

* Westminster System =&gt; EU-PM (Head of Government)
* Commission should be MEPs
* Replace the Council of the EU with an elected Senate
* Scrap the European Council
* Figurehead President (Head of State)

I'd be delighted to answer and questions, or hear any comments or criticisms on these proposals.

&gt;No real doctor or surgeon would perform such a procedure, it's usually some old village woman who does it.

It depends. In places such as Indonesia and Egypt it is performed by trained medical professionals, in others not. Just like male circumcision. 

&gt;The procedure involves removing not only the clitoris, but all of the outside vulva area. 

Genital mutilation, for both sexes, involves a wide spectrum of practices and traditions. Not all forms of FGM involve full or even partial clitoridectomy. 

&gt;but there is no reason to circumcise a woman unless it's to control her.

Feminist/Western propaganda. Parents circumcise their daughters because they believe it is the right thing to do; they *do* believe it is more hygienic, more aesthetic, religiously mandated, etc. Basically the exact same reasons boys are circumcised.

Whether something has benefits does not solely determine if it is beneficial. Amputating the breast buds of infant girls has obvious benefits, for example. There's more to an accurate cost benefit analysis than that. 

Also, there *is* actually some evidence that female circumcision has benefits but it is dismissed by Western doctors because this research is performed by people that practice female circumcision, yet funnily no one seems to consider the inverse.

true,Eryemil,ESPA,Spain,"&gt;A major percentage, probably a majority of FGM cases involve serious mutilation, with permanent loss of function. 

Most forms of genital mutilation that involve the excision of tissue result in a permanent loss of function; the amputation of the foreskin and frenulum being one of them, labial and clitoral hood ablation probably not. 

&gt;There are also much more unpleasant forms of FGM.

The same can be said for MGM. Genital mutilation is a spectrum. 

According to the WHO, there are four major types of FGM:

**Clitoridectomy**: partial or total removal of the clitoris or the clitoral hood.

**Excision**: partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora

**Infibulation**: narrowing of the vaginal opening through the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the inner, or outer, labia, with or without removal of the clitoris.

**Other**: all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, e.g. pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterizing the genital area.

---

The different forms of MGM are not as well documented by the WHO because they are just as varied, from penile subincision and perforation to dorsal splitting on the foreskin, gauging and so on. This does not take into account the punitive genital mutilation used against males in some parts of the world which females are wholly spared such as castration and penectomy.

---

If we were to rank all extant forms of genital mutilation currently practiced regardless of target, intent or rarity according to invasiveness and resulting loss of function the list would look a bit like this:

* Castration
* Penectomy
* Infibulation
* Total removal of the clitoris
* Penile subincision
* Partial clitoris excision
* Complete removal of the foreskin and frenulum
* Partial removal of the foreskin with or without loss of the frenulum
* Penile urethral perforation
* Dorsal slitting for the foreskin and foreskin perforation
* Labial ablation with or without removal of the clitoral hood

It seems like a logical claim to make yet circumcised women would disagree and in fact, I can't think of any self-reported study done among women in places where FGM is normalised that has corroborated this claim. 

Despite the fact that logic tells us that destroying erogenous tissue should also cause a proportional loss of sexual function, neither circumcised men *or* women report that *unless* they were circumcised as adults—for men, anyway. I also can't think of any study where women undergo adult circumcision. 

In other words, while it is almost certain that both male and female circumcision degrade sexual function, victims of it will generally not be able to tell the difference and thus not only is ruled out as a viable motivation for the practice, we can't really tell to what extent it does affect sexuality, only that it *should*.

true,theothercoolfish,CZEC,Czech Republic,"I don't think that it's a disservice to anybody to say that mutilating children's genitals is bad. Step back from your talking about the math involved, and just look at that sentence. Are you really going to disagree with it because the math is a bit different? Come on.

As a counter to your (some would say reasonable, I'd say unnecessary) argument - some proponents of mutilating genitals propose simply doing a ceremonial cut, rather than cutting anything off. No nerves are lost, but some pain is made as a ritual. Still okay to do? If you use just math, sure no problem. If you say no touching children's genitals, NO TOUCHING, then it's wrong. I think this is one of the rare cases where adding math just doesn't help.

Edit: 

I think it's a disservice to *all* children when we start making exceptions and differentiating different forms of genital mutilation. Many proponents of FGM point to male genital mutilation and rightly indicate that there is a level of hypocrisy in allowing one (for no medical purpose in the best interest of the child) and not allowing the other (also for no medical purpose in the best interest of the child). Leave kid's genitals alone, people.

As a tourist and/or somebody who has enough funds, it shouldn't be that hard to get along and to find a room in a shared apartment for a couple of months. A lot of young people are fluent in English, especially college students. Everyday situations should be as well no problem. 

If you want to find a job it could be a different story. Most companies, I can think of from the top of my head, require at least basic German skills. There are always small jobs available that don't pay you a fortune, but everybody can do and is enough to get along. You could go to a temporary-employment company (of which there are plenty in every city), which could find  a job for you, that suits your interest and skills. They usually arrange working contracts for a time span of one week to a couple of months. 

I think the best options with the most possibilities would be big, more or less international, cities like Hamburg (which is nice but quite expensive) or Berlin. 

Depending on where you are from, you have to keep in mind the requirements for your visa and how long you can stay in European Union countries. 

Well … it all depends on what you can and want to do.

It's not the same as just voting for representative a, b or c like happens in most countries now. Kinda like what happens in Switzerland but on a much larger scale. The problem with direct democracy is that people are selfish and not educated enough. I wouldn't be surprised if they vote for more expenses on social security, pensions and  lower taxes at the same time with a straight face. The topics to decide about are also too many.

true,tampysyall,null,null,"Here's some advice on the nightlife/food from an American currently studying in Sevilla. 

**nightlife**
There are three main areas to go bar hop and quite a few clubs as well. 

*Alfalfa - This is my favorite bar scene. There's about 10 bars on each side of the street. People mostly buy their one euro beers inside the bars and then stay outside to chat with each other. People here are really approachable and it's a great place to practice your Spanish if your trying to do that. The crowd here is mostly in their 20s. 

*Calle Betis - This group of bars is located right next to the beautiful river. I've only been here once or twice but I'm told it gets the most poppin' in the warmer months when everyone sits and drinks by the river. The crowd here looked younger - lots of high school kids it seems like. But, as I said, I've only been to this scene once or twice. 

* Alameda of Hercules - This is a big park like area that has more funky bars I'd say. They're known for their gay bars. Even if you don't want to hit up that scene though, it's still a cool place to go; it has a nice vibe and there's plenty of bars that aren't mainly aimed at gay clientele as well. I've been told Club Fun is a must and there's a pretty fun eighties bar there. Some bars here have an older clientele. 

*Club Buddha - Lots of study abroad kids go here. When i've gone it's been mostly Americans, but i've heard it depends on the night. It's a cool interior - four stories each with a different theme. If you go before midnight, there's no cover, but you'll probably be the only people there. 

*Club Abril - from what i've heard this club has more Spaniards but I've never been as it's really far away and i'd have to take a cab. I've heard it's really fun though.

**Food**
*Los Coloniales - The best Tapas bar I've eaten at. It's near the Catedral. Make sure you get there right around when they start serving (8ish) if you want to get a table quickly as they fill up every night.

*Cien Montaditos - This is a chain but their sandwiches are good and if you buy one then you can get a jarra of beer for one euro with your purchase. On Wednesdays and Sundays it's one euro night and the whole menus a euro. 

*Genova - This isn't quite traditional Spanish food, but I really liked their twist on tapas. Their sushi is good. 

*Iquana Ranas - If you're craving Mexican food, this is the closest semblance of Mexican food I've seen here. 

*I can't remember the name but right across from the Catedral near the starbucks, there's a really good coffee place. It has a wide selection of desserts and serves tapas. It's always busy and service is slow, even for spain, but i'd say it's worth it.

*Also can't remember the name of this one but there's a dessert shop where Plaza Nueva connects to the street with the Catedral that is really good. ",0,1362909020,null,0,false,0,c8t0gpe,t3_19sqbh,t1_c8t0gpe,t1_c8rluq5,null,1435570987,3,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,3

More than 70% of all male circumcisions are Muslim and they usually cut their boys as toddlers or preteens.  Of all circumcising countries, *only* the US and Israel practice infant circumcision. Everyone else that's not Muslim or the above two usually does it during adolescence.

Your focus on clitoridectomy as the be-all-end-all form of FGM is very telling.

&gt;As I understand it, removing a clitoris has far more effect on nerve sensation than removing the foreskin. [...] As I was saying elsewhere, the clitoris is widely considered necessary to achieve orgasm, whereas the foreskin is apparently not necessary for that purpose.

What exactly do you mean by ""nerve sensation""? 

There's more to genital function than sexual sensation to begin with; it is probably fair to assume that the clitoris is more vital to sexual satisfaction than the foreskin but it is also true that it has only one function while the foreskin has many.

From the UN:

This year's theme from the UN is “A promise is a promise: Time for action to end violence against women”

Much progress has happened over the last few decades. Today, there are international agreements and treaties specifically aimed at giving women and girls the respect, dignity, choices and freedom that every human being should enjoy. Important steps have been taken globally and regionally to end violence against women. More than 125 countries have specific laws that penalize domestic violence. Still, 603 million women live in countries where it is not considered a crime.

The new millennium has witnessed a significant change and attitudinal shift in both women's and society's thoughts about women's equality and emancipation. Many from a younger generation feel that 'all the battles have been won for women' while many feminists from the 1970's know only too well the longevity and ingrained complexity of patriarchy. With more women in the boardroom, greater equality in legislative rights, and an increased critical mass of women's visibility as impressive role models in every aspect of life, one could think that women have gained true equality. The unfortunate fact is that women are still not paid equally to that of their male counterparts, women still are not present in equal numbers in business or politics, and globally women's education, health and the violence against them is worse than that of men.

However, great improvements have been made. We do have female astronauts and prime ministers, school girls are welcomed into university, women can work and have a family, women have real choices.

But tell me, which government should listen to the Argentine people and take their wishes into account in negotiations? The Spanish or the Argentine?

----

**EDIT** OK, it was a bad analogy. Let's try this: Spain claims a town of about 2000 people. Argentina says the inhabitants don't want to give it. Spain argues: ""Of course they won't. It belonged to me originally, but you went and put Argentines there, and now you say we have to respect their wishes? That town would be all but depopulated by now, if you didn't keep injecting Argentines into it for all these years. What would their wishes be but **your** wishes? Theirs is not an independent decision, they don't have their own interests. They are the living definition of **colony**, so we refuse to treat them as a third party in this dispute.""

Alright, [let's see what WHO has to say](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/):

&gt; FGM is often motivated by beliefs about what is considered proper sexual behaviour, linking procedures to premarital virginity and marital fidelity. FGM is in many communities believed to reduce a woman's libido and therefore believed to help her resist ""illicit"" sexual acts. When a vaginal opening is covered or narrowed (type 3 above), the fear of the pain of opening it, and the fear that this will be found out, is expected to further discourage ""illicit"" sexual intercourse among women with this type of FGM. 

&gt; FGM is associated with cultural ideals of femininity and modesty, which include the notion that girls are “clean” and ""beautiful"" after removal of body parts that are considered ""male"" or ""unclean"". 

Here's the campaign [Desert Flower Foundation](http://www.desertflowerfoundation.org/en/what-is-fgm/) aimed at ending FGM:

&gt; Female Genital Mutilation (often referred to as FGM) is a destructive operation, during which the female genitals are partly or entirely removed or injured with the goals of inhibiting a woman’s sexual feelings. 

So yes, it's very much about sexual control of women and it's disgusting to see you dismissing it. If you aim is to protect boys against circumcision you've managed to piss all over both issues.

&gt; These are the results, not the motives.

None of us spoke a word of German before we arrived (us being me, him, our two kids), and we had about two weeks notice that it was definitely happening and about four weeks beyond that of hoping it might actually be seriously happening.  So no time to learn German, though we did start the application for our visas (good thing, too, because two plus months later and we're still working on them).  

My husband works for an American company at the moment, though when his work visa is completed he will switch to the payroll of the German version.  That's likely easier than coming in to a brand new company that is German.  He doesn't need to speak German, and his whole office speaks English (cue arrogant American discussion here, but to be fair, the office does a lot of communication with South Africa as well).  

We all now have (mostly) four year visas.  My girls and I have residency visas, my husband has a work visa.  The Germans love paperwork, so just accept it and don't moan about it, but it does take some time as an American with a family to get everything going and set up properly.  If you're unmarried without dependents it will be a lot easier (we needed the original birth certificates for all of us, the original marriage license AND certificate, our college diplomas for both of us, of course our passports, trying to think what else).  

I don't think you'll be able to come here and just get a job.  If you'd like to come here, find a German company willing to hire you (if you move yourself that may be easier so they don't expect to pay $25,000 to move you) or find an American company willing to send you to Germany for something.  If you have a scientific background here in Dresden there are a couple of institutes for which you could work if you were hired.  But I don't think you'll be able to get a work visa if you show up and just go knocking on doors for a job.  Like I said, even as a dependent I had to show that *I* had a college degree to help the visas along.  I'm not even allowed to work here.  Nice to know the Cornell degree helped somewhere (I've been a stay at home mom for nearly 11 years, only three years after I got the degree).

However, if you offer a special skill that is unavailable/in demand (IT, Software, chemistry)  you have a shot.

What's wrong with Switzerland? They seem to be doing great, actually!

&gt;The problem with direct democracy is that people are selfish and not educated enough.

And the problem with lack of democracy is that tyrants and dictators are selfish, not educated enough and often do act against what's best for the people.

&gt;I wouldn't be surprised if they vote for more expenses on social security, pensions and lower taxes at the same time with a straight face.

I'm also not surprised when politicians do that to pander to the population which votes for them.

&gt;The topics to decide about are also too many.

Nobody is forcing people to vote, if you don't know or don't care about some legislation going on a referendum, then stay at home and let the rest of society decide for you (just like it happens so often even with representative democracy).

&gt;In Switzerland it only works on a small scale and I doubt they get to decide on absolutely everything on a federal level too.

Of course they don't decide everything, there's democratically elected representatives to handle the trivial matters, yet everything can be challenged in a referendum and they've been doing great under such a system where it's the people who held the power and it's not taken away from them one way or the other.

And that is also true in systems that deviate from a market system and are more focused on centralised planning.

&gt;The market can not extract any wealth from such a person

Even the people with the lowest skills can often do something valuable. Sure, if you are talking about children, the very old or handicapped people, you're right, they're often of any use, but that's the same be it in a market economy or a planned economy.

&gt;A government however could choose to serve this person's interests and pay them to stare at a wall all day. Thus, a job has been created.

That's stupid, no job was created, you were just paying that person to not do anything. If you were to help people by paying them to do redundant things like digging up ditches and filling them back up or making them stare at a wall, you might just as well give them the benefit without required them to do those silly things - if there's really nothing else they can be doing and their skills are truly worthless in the marketplace, then just give them the money directly (as in the form of unemployment subsidies or a negative income tax) or at least give them the opportunity to improve their skills (be it by either improving the education sector or by giving incentives to companies who do employ these people).

Anyway, artificially creating employment is silly, employment is the cost, the benefit is the product of the labour, if you are to pay people to not produce, then you might just as well use the money for more productive things such as in trying to improve the skills of these people so that they do can become more productive and live on their own without the support of society at large.",0,1362918041,null,0,false,0,c8t1bzz,t3_19z1kf,t1_c8t1bzz,t1_c8sxbi2,null,1431539836,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Il calcio come il gossip e la politica rientrano in quegli argomenti dove si creano SEMPRE schieramenti, litigi, discussioni sterili esclusivamente fini a se stesse (non sono discussioni che fanno crescere o riescono a convincere chicchessia a cambiare bandiera o partito) meglio note come **chiacchiere da bar**, abbi pazienza e scusaci se speravamo in qualcosa di meglio per /r/italy... diventare una succursale del bar sport o del parrucchiere anche no.

True but has any other democracy in the world done that bad? I mean there's a reason why it's only been a thing in ancient greece and switzerland. 

&gt;[shameless copypasta from wikipedia:] In Switzerland, single majorities are sufficient at the town, city, and canton level, but at the national level, double majorities are required on constitutional matters. The intent of the double majorities is simply to ensure any citizen-made law's legitimacy.
Double majorities are, first, the approval by a majority of those voting, and, second, a majority of cantons in which a majority of those voting approve the ballot measure. A citizen-proposed law cannot be passed in Switzerland at the national level if a majority of the people approve but a majority of the cantons disapprove. For referendums or propositions in general terms (like the principle of a general revision of the Constitution), the majority of those voting is enough.

I'm just wondering what your view on this is. How would you implement the double majorities or similar thing on a EU wide level? How do you decide which is trivial and should be decided by elected representatives and what is not?

Imo the population is quite easily seduced/deceived. They'r quite short sighted too.
This happens both in regular democracies and direct democracies but i'd really imagine it being worse in the later.

Maybe it's because I'm a Belgian and have seen enough of the old garde being blamed for our current budget. The one that the current generation has to pay for.

&gt;You say that as if the people at large where a bunch of retards that need to be taken care of and looked out for, as if ""oh, the people can't think for themselves, we need some enlightened bunch to decide what's actually best for us!

I'm just stating that some laws are a bit more nuanced then a simple bad vs good.
That budgets and economics is not just austerity vs providing stimuly and hoping everything clears up. It's percentages and shittons of numbers. Something the average person voting and proposing laws will often not consider.
That people aren't stupid but they are in fact a bit shortsighted and can often choose quick fixes over something that could infact be hindering for their grand grand children
and also last but not least, that public opinion sways fast. It's no coincidence that there were protest for the independence of Catalonia during a crisis. I doubt those would've been there if everything was going smoothly.

(I'm for splitting Belgium in the long term. But if one gave me the option of splitting it right now I'd say no. Doing so during a crisis like this would be devastating and nothing less.)

And what I said about feminists and other Western hypocrites is also true. They try very hard to draw an arbitrary line in the sand by dividing genital mutilation into ""horrific crimes against a whole sex"" and ""meh, penises"". 

The truth however is that reasons parents circumcise their daughters are more likely to resemble the reasons they cut their boys than the inverse; after all, **all** culture that practice FGM also practice MGM but the reverse is not true. Parents cut their children because ancient traditions have biased them into believing that mutilated genitals are more beautiful, cleaner/purer, more feminine/masculine, due to social pressure, due to wanting their child to be accepted by the community.

I can think of many reasons, but since your reply is consistent this is another topic altogether, dealing with the existence of countries.

&gt;Well, it's the same argument used for Olivença to remain Spanish and not Portuguese, Brazil Brazilian and not Portuguese or Native American, Poland Polish and not German and Karelia Russian and not Finnish.

They are all different arguments, and all have different legal statuses. The final argument in all of them is a mix of international law and sheer violence. By the way, the forced deportation of millions of Germans after WW2, with an incredible loss of human life, was done exactly with that in mind: better deport them all lest they be a majority in their regions.

Furthermore, the argument itself is useless in practice: if in Olivença or in Gibraltar or anywhere else something was done to kill all the current inhabitants, followed by a week of intense colonisation, everything would apparently ""work"" using that logic... let's disregard how things come to be and hold a vote.

Democracy not working? &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

&gt;How would you implement the double majorities or similar thing on a EU wide level?

I don't understand, with the principle of subsidiarity, there's no such problems that can arise.

&gt;How do you decide which is trivial and should be decided by elected representatives and what is not?

Like the Swiss do it, if the people organise and can gather say 100k signatures, they can take the issue to referenda. Let the representatives do whatever they're meant and want to do, if the people organise and decide otherwise, the people have spoken and the popular vote triumphs over the representatives' vote.

&gt;Imo the population is quite easily seduced/deceived. They'r quite short sighted too. This happens both in regular democracies and direct democracies but i'd really imagine it being worse in the later.

Nah, it's even worse in representative democracies where people argue over who should lead and not what policies we should pursue. Besides, representatives can be bribed, be corrupted and use their powers for personal gain (like they so often do) whereas in more direct democracies, unless society as a whole benefits, the law won't pass, there's much less incentives for special interest groups to lobby the representatives, they can only get what they want if society at large benefits.

&gt;Maybe it's because I'm a Belgian and have seen enough of the old garde being blamed for our current budget. The one that the current generation has to pay for.

Hey, I'm Portuguese and the bullshit spending our politicians did, often against the popular vote, that's what got us into this position. When compared to more direct democracies, we're far worse and yet when compared to other systems other than democracies, we're far better. So yeah, I'm all for more democracy.

&gt;I'm just stating that some laws are a bit more nuanced then a simple bad vs good. That budgets and economics is not just austerity vs providing stimuly and hoping everything clears up. It's percentages and shittons of numbers. Something the average person voting and proposing laws will often not consider.

Same thing with representatives. Do you really think they read all the shit they're legislating on? Why should they if, by assumption, most people don't even bother?

People would indeed bother more if they at least had the possibility of making a choice. I'm sure people in Switzerland don't vote just because, if they have no clue whatsoever they either get informed or don't vote at all. The problems you're raising about more direct democracy are also very prevalent among representatives, it's not like they're this all wise group of people that will improve our lives for us.

&gt;That people aren't stupid but they are in fact a bit shortsighted and can often choose quick fixes over something that could infact be hindering for their grand grand children and also last but not least, that public opinion sways fast.

Same thing with representatives. As for the long term vs short term thing, well, our representatives here in Portugal basically stole our future away from us, people my age and a bit older are fleeing the country for better prospects of living, they don't want to be stuck in a country with so higher taxation and so few employment opportunities.

&gt;It's no coincidence that there were protest for the independence of Catalonia during a crisis. I doubt those would've been there if everything was going smoothly.

I fail to see how this can be used as an argument against more direct democracy.",0,1362921714,null,0,false,0,c8t1qrv,t3_19z8g3,t1_c8t1qrv,t1_c8t1lrf,null,1431540032,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

WHO seems to use some weasel words there without proper quantifying (how ""often""? how ""many""?). Sloppy text for a source that presents itself authorative on the matter. That kind wouldn't fly even in Wikipedia without fellow editors demanding cited numbers.

And then to strengthen it's point WHO refers to Type III FGM, which is one of the least prevalent types - making a baseless generalization.

I have no doubt that depending on local culture *some* forms of FGM may indeed be motivated by beliefs of controlling sexual behavior. But that citation does not in any way demostrate that all would be or even most.

&gt; Here's the campaign Desert Flower Foundation aimed at ending FGM:

The problem with that citation is lumping *all* FGM into same bucket with some types of FGM. 

And actually some forms of FGM do enhance female sexual stimulus (e.g. making a cision to clitoral hood, stretching of labia etc).

EDIT: Here's a study how one of the most severe forms of FGM (including aforementioned type III) affects sexual stimulus among Sudanese women: [The Sexual Experience and Marital Adjustment of Genitally Circumcised and Infibulated Females in The Sudan](http://www.fgmnetwork.org/authors/Lightfoot-klein/sexualexperience.htm)

&gt;In a study conducted over a 5-year period, the author interviewed over 300 Sudanese women and 100 Sudanese men on the sexual experience of circumcised and infibulated women. Sudanese circumcision involves excision of the clitoris, the labia minora and the inner layers of the labia majora, and fusion or infibulation of the bilateral wound. *The findings of this study indicate that sexual desire, pleasure, and orgasm are experienced by the majority of women who have been subjected to this extreme sexual mutilation, in spite of their also being culturally hound to hide these experiences.* These findings also seriously question the importance of the clitoris as an organ that must be stimulated in order to produce female orgasm, as is often maintained in Western sexological literature. 

And it's also worth bearing in mind that the Sudanese form of FGM is one of the most extreme and relatively rare globally.",0,1362925133,null,0,1362926783,0,c8t289p,t3_19zmwn,t1_c8t289p,t1_c8t14rc,null,1431540210,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

I am talking about the ""it's the current inhabitants will that counts"" argument that was being used, not any other. The Falklands seem to be a very delicate topic since it seems that there was always a lot of overlap in terms of *de jure* rulers, i.e. at the same time different countries were assuming that they were the rulers of it.

Still, my argument is *not* against the UK in this matter, I do not have a completely defined opinion on the topic since I haven't read about it enough. In any event Argentina became independent of Spain, and there are surely agreements concerning that, so like any former colony it has jurisdiction over the territory that was claimed and recognised... I think that is what they actually use as the argument:

&gt;Argentina posits that it gained the Falkland Islands from Spain, upon becoming independent from it in 1816, and that the UK illegally occupied them in 1833 (...) Argentina claims that, in 1833, the UK expelled Argentine authorities and settlers from the Falklands with a threat of ""greater force"" and that the UK afterwards barred Argentines from resettling the islands

Zum Beispiel hat er früher unglaublich viele Arbeitsplätze geschaffen, Autobahnen gebaut und die deutsche Kultur (Oper, Theater) gefördert.
Dass das auch damit zusammenhängt, dass viele Menschen starben und die Autobahnen als Panzerstrecken ins Ausland genommen wurden leugne ich dabei doch garnicht.

In deinem Kommentar scheint es so, als würde ich denken, dass es egal ist, dass jüdische Kinder kein Recht auf Äpfel hatten sondern es nur beachtenswert war, dass er die Bäume pflanzen ließ. Falsch.

Ich sage nur, dass - trotz beachtung all der sehr schlimmen Taten die er begehen ließ - es auch gute Auswirkungen gab.
Die Forschung und Entwicklung wurde - nicht nur in Deutschland - sondern auch in den feindlichen Ländern erheblich gefördert. Dass dabei auf neue Waffensysteme abgezielt wurde bedeutet nicht, dass dabei nicht auch andere, heute sehr nützliche, Erfindungen/Entdeckungen gemacht wurden.
Und dass so viele Juden starben, war nicht nur Hitlers schuld.
Der Herr Himmler hatte diese kranken Fantasien und ließ Folterzentren innerhalb der Konzentrationslager errichten in denen die Gefangenen extremsten Bedingungen ausegsetzt waren.
Leider hat Hitler das einfach geschehen lassen.

As for the long term vs short term thing, well, our representatives here in Portugal basically stole our future away from us, people my age and a bit older are fleeing the country for better prospects of living, they don't want to be stuck in a country with so higher taxation and so few employment opportunities.

Why? Well i'm not too familiar on what all went down in Portugal and it probably is not that simple but my guess is that they voted massively for the party that said they would reduce taxes, increase pensions, invest in the wrong stuf and so on leaving your agegroup with unsustainable debt during a crisis. I fail to see how they wouldn't do that to themselves in a direct democracy though hell without a structured opposition or people in a direct democracy to get tax increases going it would have probably been even worse. Maybe the mentality there is different but when I imagine people getting a voting bill infront of them with the option to vote for increased taxes when it might be needed I doubt many of them would take the responsible route and vote yes.

The history of colonialism is ugly, embarrassing, distressing and reflects badly even on the most modern of nations. The individual and overall atrocities that were committed against indigenous peoples, the oppression placed upon those who fled their European homes to avoid exactly that, the wars that have been fought and the lives that have been lost over scraps of land and jockeying for position, these are all shameful.

So we should get out and ignore that slice of our collective history right? No. We should own up to it and take responsibility for our actions and part of that is practicing what we preach with regards to the unique citizens, cultures and societies we created.

The lasting legacy of colonialism should be expressed in a single phrase, **self-determination**; and **everything** should be laser focussed on promoting and supporting just that.

“Don’t cut too much. Just cut the small skin on the tip of the clitoris. Otherwise, a woman would lose her sexuality, and you males don’t like that to happen, do you?” prominent cleric Mohammad Masyhuri told a press conference.   
Masyhuri, also a member of NU Suriah (lawmaking body), said that a proper female circumcision should not cause any damage to woman genitals. “No bleeding, if you do it properly.”

Well i'm not too familiar on what all went down in Portugal and it probably is not that simple but my guess is that they voted massively for the party that said they would reduce taxes, increase pensions, invest in the wrong stuf and so on leaving your agegroup with unsustainable debt during a crisis.

They voted for Sócrates twice which did not reduce taxes but massively increased public spending and left the public debt to stack up. [He was in office from 2005 till 2011](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/portugal/government-debt-to-gdp) and the results are here.

&gt;I fail to see how they wouldn't do that to themselves in a direct democracy though hell without a structured opposition or people in a direct democracy to get tax increases going it would have probably been even worse.

It would have been far far easier to block the megalomaniac public works he developed while still allowing for some of the good things he did such as in the abortion referendum which passed and the legalisation of gay marriage (which wasn't achieved in a referendum but could just as well been done that way).

&gt;Maybe the mentality there is different but when I imagine people getting a voting bill infront of them with the option to vote for increased taxes when it might be needed I doubt many of them would take the responsible route and vote yes.

People aren't morons, it's often the politicians that go ""we'll spend more on you without taxing you more"", people do realise you need to increase taxation to increase spending and that way it's easier to prevent runaway public spending and taxation (again, look at Switzerland, their tax rates are far lower and yet their public spending is also quite low and they live much better off).",0,1362931605,null,0,false,0,c8t3iex,t3_19z8g3,t1_c8t3iex,t1_c8t2pa6,null,1431540950,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Since the biggest central banks in the world are already setting rates towards the zero bound, they have almost exhausted all their instruments available to them. More aggressive bond buying won't help if the governments don't step up with stimulus. That is, unless we give them more scope to move in.

What people need to understand is that a central bank should be more than capable of handling inflation pressure by monetary policy in the good times, but during a depression - it is vital for fiscal and monetary powers to be used in tandem. Countries that do not utilize their macroeconomic tools properly get bad results. Fiscal policy is completely wasted today. Minimal increases in the European Investment Bank are not sufficient. We need politicians to surrender the austerity experiment and push for stimulus, especially in the form of transfer payments to the southern European countries.

That's a separate matter though, not directly related to the will of the current inhabitants. And for me it's something that should be considered, which is my whole point: there is a lot more to consider in this situations than the vote of current inhabitants. Furthermore I'm not implying that Argentina ""is right"" in this regard.

&gt;So there's Spain with highly questionable claim to the islands, and Argentina with a way worse one.

If the claims were strong, I mean, if they were 100% certain, would that mean something in terms of how you consider the situation? Would that invalidate the referendum?

That's not an issue when you consider three things:

* ""British"" islanders have been there for centuries, like I mentioned in an earlier post I understand why people hate arbitrary cut-off points but come on, if 200yrs isn't enough then America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand (along with countless others) better start packing their bags right quick.
* The Argentinian's only have themselves to blame for the demographic makeup of the Falklands today, Argentine civilians were allowed to peacefully live alongside the Islanders from the island's inception right up until the 1982 invasion.

They mean, however, that *the will of the current inhabitants isn't the only criteria that should be used*, which is my point from the start.

I wasn't referring to the certainty. 100% strong claim of ownership is pretty much only available if you made it out of raw materials you dug up and none else ever had any use for them.

From that perspective Britain has a perhaps 90% claim on the Falklands, which might be better than the Brits have on England (there is a case to be made for celtic rule, if a terrible one, but it's a hell of a lot more legitimate than some Spanish dude playing around with maps).

The BahnCard25 is better if you can make your train reservations in advance, since the 25% discount is on top of any advance-purchase discount.  With the BahnCard50, the 50% discount is only off of the normal ticket price.  So if you are buying tickets a few weeks in advance, the final price is often about the same with the two cards.

OK let me get into it. 

- They sold hundreds of thousands of ancient forest for the ridiculous amount of 11 million euro with shady practices. edit: 317,000 acres, edit2 for ""shady"": ""The contract was made without competition, directly awarded to a company that was created two days ago (with a share capital of 60,000 euros!) And release from any liability remedying environmental damage had been done by the Canadian TVX Gold (left overnight from the mines Cassandra leaving 472 unpaid workers - total debt to employees: 17 million).""

- The Greek state wont get a single euro out of the mining business - NONE. All goes to the company. 

- Many professors like environmentalists, biologists and agronomists (I don't know if that's the term) have given their studies to the state with the huge impact on environment, animals and people which are all based on similar mines around the world. [This is what the land will become like](http://www.zougla.gr/assets/images/631134.jpg). 

- Only argument some people make is it will create some hundred jobs for some years (4-5 I think). Then the company will leave and it will leave a huge hole in the forest with poison in it. If an accident hasn't yet happened as is the case with many mines like in Finland where lakes where polluted for many kilometers away. Also, for one job they create they will destroy 5 others - beekeepers, fishermen, farmers, animal herders, and all the jobs of tourism (Halkidiki is a highly touristic region) will be affected heavily. Just an example: the region produces a big amount of Greece's honey and the toxic dust will disorientate the bees and kill the plants. I don't know if you know how important are bees for our environment and our lives. The toxic dust will also carry in every direction through the wind. The company says it won't but this is ridiculous. There are days in Thessaloniki that we have red dust everywhere from... Africa. So for some slave wages for some years we have to destroy our land, our health and so many other jobs which actually bring wealth that stays on our land? 

- Greece is small, it's not like Canada with vast spaces. 4 gold mines in northern Greece will mean the undermining of the whole area and the huge affect in the health of people and animals. There is 0,8 gram of gold in 1 ton of dirt - imagine how much ground they have to destroy.

- Places like Halkidiki are places that have to be supported by mild development (I don't know if that's the term in English). Things like tourism, agro-tourism, agriculture, bio stuff, farming etc. These will be the jobs that will last and will bring wealth to our home without destroying ancient forests and our health. 

- I don't know if you can feel it but it pains you deeply when your land is being sold for a ridiculous amount of money to some multinational company and they prohibit you to walk in a beautiful forest that your fathers, grandfathers and ancestors walked freely. I don't know if you can feel that thing but I am sharing it. 

- I don't know if google translate will make a good job to translate [those figures](http://antigoldgreece.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/poreia2411-nogold/)  for you to know more about the situation. edit: [link translated by google](http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fantigoldgreece.wordpress.com%2F2012%2F11%2F20%2Fporeia2411-nogold%2F&amp;act=url&amp;authuser=0). moredit: the translation makes a huge mistakes because it misses the greek negative (δεν): the mine won't be underground, it will be on the ground as the picture I shared above shows (these on ground mines are the most destructive when it comes to environmental impacts and accidents).

- Here is also [a report from the German ARD](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfwNwNyRGO0). It's German with Greek subs. I can't find it with English subs but I will try and edit it if I find it. 

- The big media don't play any of our arguments. One of the channels actually belongs to a guy who has a share in the planned mines. We are fighting years now to be heard with every way we can while we are being teargassed and beaten by the police. But although we have presented so many counter-arguments none of the politicians listen cause as a man in the video says something shady is again going on as is the case with the corrupt ruling class of Greece.

That missile would almost certainly be shot down mid stream by one of the USA's anti missile things (basically, when they see a missile coming, they fire another missile which meets the first mid way through so that they both blow up). In that case, the USA itself would go completely unscathed and one could make the argument that this means NATO cannot be invoked. Whether an *attempted* attack on US soil is enough to invoke NATO or whether the attack has to actually touch down is incredibly unclear. Some one can come and say their interpretation of the articles, but the point stands that all NATO members wont necessarily see it the same was as you.

you can also rent a car (starts at 50€ from friday evening to monday morning)

you should obviously try to get friday off, otherwise the time in train / time in the respective city ratio would be bad! e.g. heidelberg -&gt; berlin = 7hrs (even though you can take the earliest train on monday and start late).
If this isn't possible go to places that aren't that far away.

Regarding the cities: well, the good big ones are Berlin, Hamburg, Stuttgart, München, maybe Dresden. When the weather is good you should also check out the baltic sea (Rostock or island Rügen). And maybe also Köln.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"Whilst the UN might allow for a war to take place, there's nothing *forcing* any one to go to war, apart from maybe South Korea who have the choice between war or annihilation. NATO articles seem really important here because there'll be little motive for countries in Europe to participate. They/we're not in range of any missiles and they/we are much more pacifist than America and even Canada (exceptionally so if you exclude the UK and France). So most EU states would *probably* need to be forced to participate.

In the first Korean War I believe there actually was a motive for most. That being that the USSR was actually a threat to every one because the USSR was right next to every one. North Korea isn't close to any one and isn't a threat to most of us.

I think it's worth looking at Iraq. Iraq invaded Kuwait in the *First* Gulf War. Iraq wasn't quite as internationally dangerous to every one at this point as North Korea, but Iraq could certainly cut off a lot of our oil. So a bunch of coalition forces invaded. *However*, a huge proportion of Western countries didn't. They didn't want to involve themselves. This happened with Britain and the Vietnam War too. Britain didn't want to be involved, so didn't participate. 

It's worthing noting that I think, should a Korean War come to fruition, a few European states will get involved along with the USA (assuming the USA does).

true,antonia90,CYPR,Cyprus,"Well, Cyprus actually has quite a large number of english speakers, partly due to the fact that we used to be a british colony and also because a lot of people are going abroad to study.

You can read news about cyprus in english in this newspaper website: http://www.cyprus-mail.com/.

Now, on the reasons why Cyprus spends so much on higher education.

First of all, Cyprus is a small place where everyone knows each other. In such a small community, people like to compare themselves to others and it's important to them if they make more money, have a bigger house and what their kid's job is. Better job = more social success which is very important here.

No one wants to do any kind of 'practical' work (even though it's perfectly fine and people that do it are not necessarily poorer) because it's considered to be a lesser kind of work. So everyone wants to send their kid to study.

Secondly, (imho) the education system in Cyprus is more or less crap. In school, very little attention is given to more practical or creative subjects. Music, arts (any kind) and sports get very limited time and usually are taught be people who are not qualified enough. So a kid that has any kind of inclination or talent in these things can grow up and possibly never even realise their talent, let alone cultivate it. Also, very little 'career guidance' is given in schools, again by people who are not qualified enough.

Therefore, lots of 17 year-olds finish school not knowing what they want to do with their lives afterwards.

The system works like this: 

When you're in your last year of high school you have two options: take an exam (which is the same exam you have to take in order to graduate) for a place in a (public) university in Cyprus or Greece (it's the same exam) or apply for a place in other universities abroad excluding Greece (usually in the UK). Before you take that exam you submit a list of your choices for different positions in various universities in Greece and Cyprus. I think you can list up to 5 in order of preference. Everyone takes the exam, gets ranked and they get assigned different positions according to their grade.

As I said, most of them don't know what they want to do. So they just put on the list whatever they feel like at the moment, take the exam and then eventually get a place somewhere even though they never really wanted that. Due to the reasons I explained before, the parents then push them to accept the place, so in the end virtually everyone goes to study in a university because that's the ""proper think to do"".

They ultimately go back to Cyprus looking for a job, but everyone has a degree so it's no so easy anymore. So educated and qualified people who could actually produce something good, end up getting stupid jobs doing trivial things.

Aside from that, Nuremberg has many interesting places to visit, like the [Nazi Party Ralley Grounds](http://www.nordbayern.de/polopoly_fs/1.1529476.1316785455!image/2641726917.jpg_gen/derivatives/gallery_full/2641726917.jpg) and one of the most important [castles](http://www.schloesser.bayern.de/bilder/schloss/nbg_kaiserburg1.jpg) of germany.

If you like beer, you are almost in the heaven of beer: Beer-franconia, it's a bit north of Nuremberg. You can find about 200 breweries in an area with an diameter of about 50 kilometres. The centre of the beer region is Bamberg, which has the UNESCO world heritage status for beeing a [perfect example for a medivial european](http://pb.schweigt.net/_index/_medias/_sb/sb_4.jpg) city with houses and palaces from 14th to 18th century. Almost all buildings in the old centre are historic and protected because of this. And yes, the house on the right of the picture with the small tower with the two bridges stands in the middle of the river.

If you are into wine, just drive half an hour more and you reach Würzburg with an impressive [Palace](http://www.residenz-wuerzburg.de/bilder/tourist/gartenfassade.jpg) you might know from the latest Three musketeers movie (large parts were shot in Würzburg and Bamberg).

But she's *not* the Pope, and not a cleric, *she's an American writer*. And I provided an actual source where an actual Indonesian top cleric says quite the opposite than she did on her opinion piece.

&gt; But whatever, it's easy to find [1] other sources claiming the same thing.

Yes, it's quite easy to find all kinds of claims by Googling. 

That claim in your link is wrong: FGM does not mean ""partial or total removal of external genitalia"". Only some of the forms of FGM involves such practices e.g. in Sudan and Egypt. Using blanket statements and wide brushes on a complex issue with a lot of variation is not helpful in charting the reality.

&gt; [2] It's obvious that FGM has this effect. 

Yes, the most severe forms of FGM do have adverse effects on female sexual stimulus, though does not prevent orgasms as per the study I linked earlier. The study mentioned in your link included most severe forms of FGM (pharaotic) and [confirms the adverse effects](http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/elsevier/sexual-function-in-women-with-female-genital-mutilation-JHwH1JYZ6b). 

But that study is not without problems in it's methodology: for some reason the women were not clinically studied to determine what kind of FGM they actually had experienced. Instead the women self-reported their FGM in a questionnaire as: ""Phaaroni"" 42%, ""none Phaaroni"" 41%, ""unknown"" 17%.

&gt; With so many millions suffering, it's not a surprise to anyone. 

How many millions are suffering from these most severe forms of FGM (pharaotic) and where?

&gt; So at best it's a consequence they don't give a shit about. Why? Because the women haven't lost anything important. Which brings us back to my point.

I do get your point. And I have no doubt that depending on local culture *some forms* of FGM *may* be motivated by beliefs of controlling sexual behavior. My critisism to your point has been and is that it:

1. Confuses various forms of FGM  
2. Lacks actual evidence (e.g. confirming studies, and how do the women themselves see the issue?) 

About Indonesia:

true,mrh112,EURO,European Union,"Well, a few reforms I feel will make the EU stable include in no particular order: 

-In place of the current institutions introduce:

1) A Consortium acting as the Legislative unicameral house of the EU, every state appoints one European minister who acts as the primary representative of his/her nation to the EU. This minister could be appointed in any way the Nation sees fit, by the parliament or the people in an election. 
In my opinion having one legislative house with ministers directly accountable to their nations is more in line with the Confederal nature of the EU and assures decisions are made with consensus of all members rather than by a majority in the inflated European Parliament (which also distorts power towards larger nations which have more citizens thus seats), or the council of the EU (which is made up of heads of government who are far more concerned with their own national issues and administration than that of the EU).

2) The Executive arm of the EU, the commission, should be repalced with the European Government, simply put this is a group of ministers who run the departments of the EU with a Chancellor (equivilent of the President of the Commission) appointed by the Consortium, the ministers the Chancellor appoints are approved by the Consortium and can be removed at any time at their consent likewise along with the Chancellor).

3) the Court of Auditors (an incredibly controversial organ of the EU) should be replaced with the Commission of Auditing, this again is made up of one minister of each EU state, again this minister can be appointed by means of which the member state sees fit.

The other institutions of the EU will remain as they are currently with the future reforms planned.

Besides house ownership and such, perhaps (private) pension claims could be be a relevant explanatory factor.

Given however that Germany  and Austria both appear to have very little by means of pension assets, it might not be that relevant in explaining the effect for these specific countries.

The main problem is though that it is not specified what exactly was better/worse and/or which answers are valid. For instance, Wiener Schnitzel (national dish) surely was not bad in 1938-1945.

Your American high school degree is not equal to the Abitur, which is the high school diploma obtained by uni-bound German students. Expect to need to do some upgrading before you can attend a German university. A Bachelor is three years in Germany, not four, because students are at a higher level when they begin. (That's why your American degree doesn't quite compare.)

I imagine you'll need to have a basic level of German proficiency as well to be considered because you are attending as a regular student (things are a bit more lenient with exchange students who come only for a semester/year). A year of immersion with focused study can get you to the B2 level, but if you slack off and speak English a lot (yup, including internet hours!) or just try to ""absorb"" it without any/much formal study, it'll take longer.

There's a big difference, though: With the BC25, you get 25% off of all fares.

Basically, the BC50 only makes sense if you plan to travel spontaneously, because the Sparpreise are only available if you book them at least three days before you travel (and are generally cheaper if you book them earlier).

Most of people here will tell you Barcelona because it´s far more touristic, fashionable and attracts more tourists. Madrid is more typical of what as a foreigner you would expect from Spain.  It feels like a small village, you can eat good and cheap gatronomic tapas and go to see a corrida. In parallel you also have super trendy neighborhoods like Chueca (gay district) or Malasaña in which you´ll be able to party a lot. The offer of museums is very good too. As someone said it´s less touristic, which makes it more valuable to those who know the city. The major drawback of Madrid is temperature in summer, in case you plan a visit by that time I would not do it. 
Barcelona is awesome as well, there are plenty of things to do, the old districts are really magical, if you like the Gaudi style you will be pleased, and of course it´s close to the sea (even though you do NOT want to go swimming in the sea from the city). Last thing, in terms of music-parties Madrid is rock, whereas Bcn is electro.
TL-DR: both cities are awesome, Barcelona is not Spain, it´s full of tourists, but has the sea. Madrid is more of a secret garden in which you can do cool discoveries but that take time to discover. If you have 1 city to visit in summer, I would go for Barcelona, but if 1 day you have the chance to live in Spain, go for Madrid.

Each member state has 3 seats, and the governments of each state appoints them how they wish, and the Commissioners are reappointed by each successive government.

true,_delirium,DENK,Denmark,"There was a scandal a few years ago in the German parliament over nobody even bothering to show up. There's a weird system where *technically* a quorum of 50% of members must be present for a vote to be legitimate, but this is not counted unless at least 5% of members demand a count, which rarely happens. An opposition party managed to demand a count, and the quorum failed, which led to a bunch of controversy directed at *them*: they were accused of being anti-democratic by using technical tricks to delay the passage of legislation that the majority of parliament approved of (even though the majority could have avoided this problem by attending the session...).

To avoid such problems, the Danish parliament has actually institutionalized it, amazingly enough. The parties have each agreed on a ranking of their members, and if some members of a party are absent, the other parties will instruct their members lowest on the ranking to abstain from all votes (even if they're present) to keep the balance of power constant. So e.g. if 5 members of a party with 30% of seats are absent, then a party with 6% of seats whose members are all present, will instruct 1 member not to vote, so that they abstain in the same proportion.",0,1362952700,null,0,1362953003,0,c8t9ek4,t3_1a0sg4,t1_c8t9ek4,t1_c8t3082,null,1435570594,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

true,nippleeee,null,null,"I would recommend estimating how many days of travel and much it would cost to buy tickets for the places you want to visit and then comparing the estimate to the cost of the rail pass. How many weekends will you have if you travel to new places weekly?

There are a lot of great day passes for the trains - the Schoenes Wochenende ticket works on weekends and is good for unlimited travel for up to five people on regional trains (so no fast ICE trains). There are also regional passes that are good any day of the week within each state. If you can find people to share a ticket with, the cost goes way down.

For places close to Heidelberg, I'd recommend: 

* Oppenheim (tunnels under the city and an ossuary)

* Speyer (a kind of hokey museum of technology, but I highly recommend the slide from the airplane out back)

* Trier (some awesome ruins)

* Freiburg (the Black Forest)

* Münster (nice nightlife)

* Cologne (one of my favorite cities)

* Darmstadt (really cool art nouveau architecture, a Russian orthodox church, and a crazy apartment building!)

* Mannheim (not so pretty but really close to Heidelberg, I'd recommend visiting during the week and not using a weekend day on it)

* Ulm (Einstein was born there, and they have the tallest cathedral spire in the world)


A bit farther:

*  southern Germany: Munich and nearby Ammersee and Kloster Andechs, Bamberg, Regensburg, Füssen, 
Chiemsee, and Berchtesgaden. 

* central: Jena and Weimar

* east: Berlin, Dresden, and Leipzig


I haven't been to the north yet, so I can't make any recommendations there. However, I'd say that a trip to France, Switzerland, or Austria might also be a good idea. I know you don't have unlimited time, but it can be a nice change of pace to go to another country.

The most recent forays into conflict by EU countries have been very far from popular with the people, and many governments are increasingly reluctant to engage in anything but peacekeeping or humanitarian missions.

Whereas the US would likely get involved due to them considering it their sphere of influence, and their dealings with South Korea, many EU countries are much more reluctant to enforce policy through military force (for better or worse). China would likely get involved somehow as well, but if the EU nations decided to join in, we'd quickly see a WWI like cascade of alliances and interventions.

In the years I've lived here, I find myself occasionally using grammatical constructions that are slightly weird in ""native"" English and which I would never have used before, simply because I've run across them many times. There is a subconscious tendency to write emails to people in a similar style to the ones they write to me. So I avoid using constructions that are ""correct"" English but which Danes never use, and instead I adopt constructions that Danes use but which Americans would probably not use.

What's probably most awkward about it is that I now use a handful of constructions that sound *slightly* non-native to Americans.

Certainly an example of these inefficiencies are the Greeks that protects its elites. These elites have been spared much of the pain the rest of the populace has suffered. As for Berlusconi let northern Italy continue its range of industrial and hi tech developments. The Netherlands are an incredible innovative country where the innovatove/bureaucratic nexus is exampled with Phillips. Indeed Britain needs to integrate its excellent inventive ability with a production/industrial base. The number of engineering graduates that have PhD's that are invited to work for Siemens, Krupp etc is representative of Britain's brain drain.

Some of them would gladly go and build a new villa in some burned down forest.

The thing is basically that Greece can't fund the operation on our own, so they made a deal that will at least give jobs cause otherwise no one is going to bother and the mines will be left unused for decades. With an asterisk that has to do with the involvement of Bobolas who is one of the ""oligarchs"".

Now the real reason behind the outcry has to be the fact that the people in the area that don't desperately need the jobs, are like, ""well I don't give a shit about getting a job right now and if I block the whole operation, then after 30-40 years when the public sector might have the funds to do it themselves, I'll just use my connections there and in the local givernment etc. and get a bigger cut for me and in addition I might do it all with EU loans I am not even going to pay or something"". It isn't really clear if this is objectionable, for my point of view it might as well be cause I have no connections with them if they ever proceed with their plan, from the point of view of the unemployed job seeker in the area it is wrong, from that of the average greek it has to be weighted with a bunch of other factors that have to do with stimulating the economy, but what is absolutely bullshit is that their main reasoning is the ""environmental concerns"". No way. Likewise I don't think that anyone is going to lose their ""ecofriendly jobs"" because of the mine.

Like you just said there are laws for this kind of thing, plus as you suspected there is a heavy amount of sensationalism and like, peer pressure, to go all ""fuck the imperialist mines"". They are putting posters with like skulls and antiradiation suits throughout the entire city.

Ethics are a fundamental part of a complete cost-benefit analysis in medicine. If it were all about supposed benefit alone, it'd be easier to justify performing double mastectomies on infant girls than circumcisions on infant boys. 

Secondly, you're purposely misinterpreting these sources. The first one, for example, defines routine infant circumcision as non-therapeutic which makes their stand on the issue quite clear; and so on down the list.

This is not a new school of thought at all. These reservations against the Euro existed before the Euro was even introduced. Especially the argument that it's not a good idea to have countries such as Germany and Spain or Italy in a currency union because their monetary policies are completely incompatible.

Concerning the party: It doesn't even exist yet. I doubt it scares Merkel (or anyone else for that matter) at this point. It will begin to scare her as soon as it gets 5% or more in elections. Right now it doesn't even seem likely that they will get enough signatures to be able to take part in the federal elections this autumn. I am German, quite interested in politics and I learned about this party just yesterday from r/europe, so you can imagine how well-known it is in the general populace at the moment.

Stating that political revolt against the Euro has reached Germany is completely overstating the situation at this point. The situation right now is that some guys that are known to be critics of the currency union want to create a new party. Nothing else has happened yet.

true,nobb,null,null,"""Putain"" come to mind, literally it's mean ""whore"" and can be use with that meaning, but it's also use as ""fuck!"", in the ""goddammit"" way (when speaking and using it for imprecation, it can be shortened to "" 'tain!""). It's probably the most used one. You can also use ""bordel"" in exactly the same way (it's mean brothel )

Also, something that seems particular to the French language is that you can chain insults, a bit like making a combo. So for example you can say ""putain de merde"", ""bordel de merde"" or even ""putain de bordel de merde"" (all with the meaning of ""goddammit"", the more word the more vulgar).

There some words that are not directly curse words, but that are vulgar and can be use in this kind of chain or in vulgar expression in general, such as : ""couilles""(nuts), ""bite""(dick),""cul"" (ass), ""chatte"" (pussy, female cat literally), ect ...

So for example you can say ""putain de bordel de merde de mes couilles"".

A second important part of French vulgarity is ""chier"" (to defecate). It's used to express the idea of being bored, bothered, being upset or reluctance. it's use this way: ""ca me fait chier"" (literally, it's make me defecate). Again, don't hesitate to concatenate expressions, such as ""putain de bordel de merde ca me fait chier la bite"".

You can also use the idea of pissing or defecating on someone's head or ass to express the idea that you dont's care about him : ""je lui pisse a la gueule"", "" je lui pisse a la raie"" (""la raie"" is part of the expression ""la raie des fesses"" which is the space between buttcheek) , ""je lui chie a la geule"", ect...  again, that can be part of a bigger insult: ""je chie dans la bouche de ce petit con de merde"".

That should be enough for a start.

The polling history is [here](http://www.spiegel.de/flash/0,,21034,00.html). A coalition that includes the Left (the party) is even more unrealistic than one with the Pirates.

true,keepthepace,FRAN,France,"I wondered the same about Sarkozy, who was a closer clone of Berlusconi that most people recognize. The reason I found is very simple : religion.

Something like 80% of Sarkozy's electorate was religious. I guess the numbers must be similar with Sarkozy. I do think that religious people tend to trust authorities more and check facts less (do I appear as biased here?). So once you are set up on accepting a given news channel as the truth and the rest as propaganda, you have a few dozen percents of voices that are given when you posses some big medias.

Well, of course *the whole country* doesn't focus on this at all. We focus on staying competitive and doing what we are good at. Although I am sure the guys we have working on the fund are top notch brokers, it's still just a small fraction of what we are doing here in Norway. 

I am sure you guys have something similar in the US and it's not like you guys *focus all your* knowledge on 1 thing.
