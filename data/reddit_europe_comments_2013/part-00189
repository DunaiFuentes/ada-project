I live near Paris, but I can still hopefully offer some advice regarding the ""small town"" thing.

You have to show that you are trying.
People here don't really like how english-speaking tourists don't even try to learn one word of french, and just speak louder english when asked to repeat themselves.
Your new neighbors will be much more inclined to give you a chance if they see that you are trying to fit in, and learn some things.

Also... We like food.
I suggest enrolling your whole family in a french cuisine class, right at the beginning.
The women will see that you are interested about a big part of their culture, and will want nothing but to share tips with you. Also, they will probably spread the word that you're not that bad, since you like the food. :)

As for the kids, I wouldn't worry, I grew up abroad (Singapore and Japan) and learned the language at school (and at the movies!) pretty fast.
Couldn't hurt to throw in a welcome party, though.


We really don't have a tradition of going over the new neighbor's place to introduce ourselves here, but since I grew up abroad, I did it anyway everywhere I went, and it went really good! People like it, I brought cookies and they thought it was cute, and it helped A LOT in getting to know the area!


What you should not do....
Hmmm...

Well, have your kids behave really badly in public, obviously, but they're pretty grown-up, so that shouldn't be a problem.

Don't rush your meals. In Europe, we have a tendency to take aaaaall the time in the world to eat, so if you're bringing the whole family to a restaurant, take your time!

Don't say ""tu"" right away. You may know that we have two ways to say ""you"" in french.
""Vous"" is the formal one, for people you don't know really well, or respect in hierarchy. ""Tu"" is used for friends and close family.
Although it might seem a little easier to use ""tu"" right at the beginning, you usually have to wait until the other person says it's okay.
It's considered rude to be called ""tu"" when you don't know someone.


Don't hug people. Kiss them. (but in the right way! :))
We don't hug as salutations. We have a way of slightly kissing the cheek (the number of kisses depends on the region of France, don't worry, everybody gets lost, even amongst french!) Try to research or observe people around you, but don't rush yourselves into their arms. Hugs are for children, couples, and really good friends. :)
Usually, it's two kisses, one on each cheek. Well, actually, it's not ON the cheek, more like you put your cheek next to each others' and kiss the air.
Gee, now that I think about it, it's kinda weird. :)

I don't know about your husband, but if he will be working in France, tell him to take the time to say a quick hello to everybody at work and try to remember their names. I had a few American colleagues that walked in, just said ""hi"", and went straight to their desk.... NO! Take the time for a coffee and hang around just a little bit before actually getting to work. Co-workers are important, and the coffee machine is out best place to hang out!

Also tell him to NOT shake hands with girls. Usually, boys shake hands, but exchange ""la bise"" (the kisses) with girls. Shaking hands with a girl can be looked as too professional, and perhaps unfriendly, although you guys will probably get by a lot of things since you're not french, nobody expects you to know everything about the culture.

Most states in Germany don't have a tuition fee anymore so studying at a public universities is generally free. What they have though is a semester contribution you have to pay per Semester. In average this due is at about 120€ per Semester but it really depends on where you're going to study. Don't begin to think about a private university, those are mostly the worst in Germany. Only 3% of all students are at a private university in Germany. (See here: https://www.study-in.de/en/study/important-facts/study-abc/--23766 for Info about tuition fees)

Yum. Of course, that's not very Parisian...

You could scour [this website](http://en.parisinfo.com/discovering-paris/major-events/christmas-in-paris) which lists things to do and places to go during the Christmas season in Paris. 

Hot spiced wine is where it's at. I never went to Christmas markets in Paris, but in Lyon and Strasbourg they're lovely so I can imagine they're worth exploring. Indulge in some nougat, hot wine, and salted caramel butter or Nutella crepes. Don't pass up the opportunity to get some hot, roasted chestnuts from vendors in the streets (the guys with cute little choo-choo-train-themed booths, not the guys cooking them over shopping carts...).

[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christmas_dishes#France) is a list of foods that are associated with Christmas time in France. You could make it a goal to indulge in a few of those. 

I'm a lady, so I don't know much about friperies specializing in menswear, but you could visit [FREE'P'STAR](http://www.freepstar.com/) (3 locations) or [Geurrisol](http://guerrisol.com/magasins.html) (there are 4 shops within the city, but I don't recommend the Barbès-Rochechouart location, it is small and disappointing). Those are the two friperies that I had most success shopping in. Wash everything. Guerrisol is gigantic, but it's not as classy or hip as Free'P'Star. [Here's a list](http://www.lebonbon.fr/2012/10/11/Top-10-des-friperies-parisienne/) of 10 top friperies in Paris.

Also the adage "" the client is king"" doesn't hold much of a validity in France, the overal principles are no matter how ""low"" every one deserve respect. At least I hope it would be the case everyday.

Also before buying, don't take the word of the dealer for it , got for a night or two (2/3 days in the towns you are willing to buy (in bed&amp;breakfeast or *maison d'hôtes*) and got to the town's market in the sundays to see how it is (garnished or scarce, friendly or not etc...), go to the bakery and taste the pastries/bread (the south isn't known for its awesome croissants, but Poitou is not really ""the south""), get to the town's café (not necessarily near the market) and take a café. If overall its positive and if you see locals are mostly smiling and the ambience is cool, open yourself to the barman/baker/market sellers about your willingness to buy in the area and see what they tell you about it. 

If you do that with even the basic of french (enough to hold a chit-chat) it will go smoothly :) ! But as french, if we have competitivity its in our perculiar quality of life, so come you are welcome !

Generally, you have to give up the US citizenship. Germany is not a fan of dual citizenship.

You may have a shot at becoming a German via the ""child of former Germans"" [clause](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/rustag/__13.html) (the ""Kann-Einbürgerung"" in WP). I personally feel that this is unlikely of you don't live in Germany.

Doesn't say anything about dual citizenship or expiry dates. Would cross-check again with the embassy, or maybe some German ministry.

If this all doesn't work, just try to get a Visa, live here for a while and then naturalize. Will cost you the US citizenship though. Or you just live in Germany with the US citizenship.

Spain will tax them, and that will reduce their need for future aid permanently. France will charge a fee for the use of their network. Those are all easily solvable.

&gt;You also have to look at the carbon output and cost in mining the iron out of the ground, transporting it to a foundry, smelting and refining it, transporting it to another factory, turning it into parts and making wind turbines / solar panels, transporting them to their final destination, installing them, repairing and maintaining them throughout their life and then eventually replacing them all after 40 years. That's a lot of carbon and a lot of money, it's not really ""renewable"" at all.

Well, ignorance would not be assumed, especially if you went to the trouble of learning Bulgarian, yet did not learn anything about the surrounding countries. Americans/Englishmen have the self centered stereotype associated with them after all. 

Oh, I forgot to correct you on something - Macedonian and Bulgarian differ by a lot, but they form a dialect continuum - meaning that eastern Macedonian dialects are similar to Western Bulgarian ones. That's where the similarity comes from - most of the contact is on the borders. But the standard language differs greatly, most of it intentionally, with Bulgarian codifiers choosing the eastern dialects, and Macedonian choosing the western dialects.

I'm not even talking about pre-Suez crisis, I'm mean right now? Those religious theocracies are supported by the UK, who allow British companies to bribe their incompetent and greedy Princes. The UK meanwhile does everything to undermine the enemy of these guys and secure their throne. That way these Princes can come to London, buy expensive houses and fuck hookers. You know spending some of that sweet oil money in the UK. Oh and in case you're to stupid to figure it out.

I never make false criticism of the UK. Also unlike the rest of the UK I'm not going to ignore all the bad shit that the UK does. Everybody was fawning over the UKs action in Libya. Yet how many people have stopped and question why there are religous extremists murdering people in post-Gaddafi Libya? Why 30,000 Black Libyans have been ethnically cleansed. Why the UK was arming and supplying Al-Qaeda affiliated groups in Libya and Syria? Nope, most British people are like you. You sit back and wonder why the world is fucked up and then pat yourself on the back, while the British armed forces and the Government are doing evil things.

So I was basing my evaluation of the methodology of this report off that one.  

This year's report does actually mention ""environment"" 15 times, you can usually ctrl-f to search for words, I don't know why you didn't find it. Last year's was more explicit which is why I had a problem. I presume they are using the same methodology as last year. Anyway [last year's report](http://www.earth.columbia.edu/sitefiles/file/Sachs%20Writing/2012/World%20Happiness%20Report.pdf), direct from The *Earth* Institute website,  mentions ""environment"" 86 times and you can see on pages 123-124 there are indicators for how concerned people are about pollution, personal responsibility to the environment, wildlife and urban use.  

Or look at this quote from page 3 of chapter 1.  

&gt;On the other hand, if we act wisely, we can protect the Earth while raising quality of life broadly around the world. We can do this by adopting lifestyles and technologies that improve happiness (or life satisfaction) while reducing human damage to the environment. “Sustainable Development” is the term given to the combination of human well-being, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability. We can say that the quest for happiness is intimately linked to the quest for sustainable development.  

Page 109 shows that this environment stuff goes into the Gross National Happiness Index.  

&gt;The GNH Index provides an overview of performances across nine domains of GNH (psychological wellbeing, time use, community vitality, cultural diversity, ecological resilience, living standard, health, education, good governance). The aggregation method is a version of Alkire Foster method (2007, 2011). The index is aggregated out of 33 clustered (grouped) indicators. Each clustered indicator is further composed of several variables. When unpacked, the 33 clustered indicators have 124 variables, the basic building blocks of the GNH Index. Weights attached to variables differ, with lighter weights attached to highly subjective variables.  

Page 128 shows it clearly being weighted into the index indicators.  

But perhaps the new report is different, it's rather unclear though and I can't be bothered chasing down all the stuff in the new document - which has a whole heap about Buddha and the failures of ""hyper-commercialism"" - when I already did it for my own purposes with the old one and that's why I made my earlier comment. I just don't think those things should be sold as a ""happiness"" index.  

Edit.
P.S.  
The Wikipedia page on [Gross National Happiness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_national_happiness) supports the view environmental effects are part of it. Interestingly another happiness index, the [Happy Planet Index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Planet_Index), which includes the environment as a factor has a rather different ranking of countries when measuring environment by footprint rather than the more vague measures in the GNH Index.

&gt; Was die linken Zweifler damals noch nicht wußten. Der umtriebige Niemeyer hatte sich 1995 bei Finanzgeschäften vergaloppiert. Das Landgericht Köln verurteilte ihn wegen Anlagebetrugs zu drei Jahren und vier Monaten Haft.

&gt; Niemeyer, schreibt der ""Stern""-Reporter, habe ihm als Rotlicht-Beauftragten ein Fräulein zum Kauf angeboten. Es handele sich um ""Die Heilige Apollonia"" in Öl, ein Originalgemälde von Leonardo da Vinci zum Spottpreis von nur 40 Millionen Dollar. Das Bild befände sich gleich nebenan in einem Banksafe. Um bei diesem misstrauischen Kunden letzte Zweifel an der Seriosität des Handels zu zerstreuen, versicherte Niemeyer schriftlich: ""Das Bild ist durch die Allianz-Versicherung geschätzt worden und wird in den nächsten Tagen auf 52 Millionen Dollar versichert.""
Im Hotelfoyer zog Niemeyer dann zur freudigen Überraschung des ""Stern""-Journalisten ein Foto seiner Frau hervor: Sahra Wagenknecht, sie sonnt sich ""auf einem Seegrundstück vor einem ansehnlichen Cottage in der irischen Steueroase Shannon"". Zumindest dieses Bild war echt.

true,Albator78,ZZZZZZpingouin,Pingouin,"A few random things that come to mind:

Language shouldn't be a problem for the kids. They've already learned three, they can learn one more. They'll be fluent in no time. 

However the French are very protective of their language (even though as a French expat I am appalled at the amount of Frenglish used in the media, and the low quality of the French spoken on TV - but hey, US TV is also horrifying for reasons that are not so different - all that matters is audience ratings and advertising revenue, right?) 

Spoken language is not really an issue, if they have an accent it's Ok, and you can count on the French to let you know when you make mistakes. The kids will have to focus on how well they write because it is important in all subject matters. When I was a kid you would lose points in math or biology because you had bad grammar or orthography. I am sure things have relaxed a bit since then (especially with the advent of the spelling reform), but your intelligence is usually judged on how you write and what you've read, even at the workplace. 

Your kids can also capitalise on their speaking Japanese, as Japanese culture, especially manga and anime are rather popular in France. Usually the kid friendly stuff, but the French are aware of the adult side of it too. 

Be curious about people, ask them questions and they will love to teach you about their life and culture. In return they will ask you a lot of questions. Don't be offended by the clichés and stereotyped view of the world. But you know that already, you've lived in different countries.

Politics: it is Ok to have different views and even argue about them, at the café, around a table, anywhere. You can defend your own point of view, just do it respectfully. These will be moments you will hear broad generalisations, and that's fine. People will even purposefully take a view they may not even believe in, just to play devil's advocate. The French love debate, even if what they say may sometimes sound ridiculous, it's all about the exercise in itself.

When the discussion is over, it is over and people pour each other another glass of wine.

It is not uncommon for people with different political views to be friends.

That's for a gross income of 100,000 dollars. Does Greece even have any wage earners that get wages that high? If you look at the tax revenue per GDP figure, you'll see a completely different picture. 

&gt;  However, if state expenditure is the way out of the mess as you seem to suggest, doesn't it trouble you that even in 2009, the year with the highest public spending ever, Greece was in recession?

I did not really suggest that. I merely stated that there is no real evidence to suggest that cutting every public service down would have much economic benefit. But let me answer your question honestly: If Greece could somehow magically continue spending as it did in 2009, the crisis would be over way faster. But obviously this was not possible because of the euro (and if we did not have the euro, we'd have to pay with inflation but maybe that would have too been better than the current mess).

&gt; Well my underpinning idea was that in order for the state to protect ALL public sector jobs it sought to raise more revenues than the Greek economy could stand (not to mention how just that is or is not). I bet that those laid off in the private sector would kill for one of the public sector jobs even if that meant that the wages wouldn't be as high as they were in good old inflated Greece in 2009.

But the state hasn't really protected public sector jobs, because the number of public servants has greatly decreased. And the wages decreased in the end. So, what does it matter to fire more people now? 

&gt; Finally, here's a good article about the Latvian case although of course you may find it ideological :) In any case, the facts you requested are there. But for the basics (GDP contraction of 24% in 2 years, unemployment, stable tax regime etc.) google is abound with verifications of them.

I do find it very ideological and I don't think it has enough evidence to support that compared to Greece Latvia did harsher austerity on the expenditure side and that is the reason for their rebound.

Das ist doch völliger Unsinn.

Wenn man das auf Agenda2010 bezieht, bei der ja jeder rumheult: Die Agenda hatte viel mehr Inhalt, als das bissjen (übertriebene, mehr oder weniger zu kritisierende) an Sozialreform.


Hier mal copy&amp;paste von nem früheren Beitrag von mir:

&gt; Man kann die Partei gerne deswegen kritisieren, dass die Agenda gegen die sozialdemokratische Idee und eben auch gegen die Interessen der Zielgruppe/Basis/Wähler ging.

&gt;Aber mal ermsthaft, um auf dem Boden der Realpolitik zu bleiben: Die Agenda war gut, da notwendig.

&gt;Differenzierte Kritiker werden erkennen, wie manche Dinge (bzw ""Reformen"") schlechter als beabsichtigt liefen, andere dagegen Deutschland unterm Strich heute besser dastehen lassen.

&gt;Deshalb hat die SPD für die Agenda 2010 nicht nur mein Verständnis, sondern meine Anerkennung. Es war ein mutiger, aber unabdingbarer Schritt.

&gt;Hätten sie ihn nicht getan, hätte sich zwar das sozialdemokratische Herz daran erfreuen können, in der Realität hätte es aber grosse Probleme verursacht.


Und ich sags mal so: wenn wir Mindestlohn bekämen, wäre die ganze HartzIV Kritik mit Kürzungen usw sowieso dahin. Und mit dem Rentenniveau das hätte sich auch gebessert.

I have not noticed a particular attitude from the people here towards the English, but I may had missed it in my observation. Maybe someone else can help me on this point.

Some things I can share:

* Walk around the city at your own pace. The city is filled with amazing buildings and spots. If you tell us what kind of things interest you when can give better recommendations.
* Keep an eye on your belongings and an inventory of the objects in your pockets. Also, be aware of your surroundings. Barcelona is notorious for its quick and ingenious pickpockets. Its not dangerous but it could give you a bad day (or month). Keeping an eye out usually prevents most problems.
* Do not act like the stereotypical movie tourists, being obnoxious, complaining about everything, being too loud on streets at night and in general treating the city as a touristic resort. Too many people do this.
* The Gothic quarter is filled with good drinking places and is wonderful for meeting people.
* All big touristic spots are good for seeing, not so good for shopping or eating beyond a simple coffee.
* Be aware of the metro schedule and know how to return home using the nit-bus (The night bus). You would be surprised how many lost and nervous tourist I have found walking on the streets late at night, wondering how the hell to return to their hotels.
* Carry a map of the metro or learn the common routes (not as hard as it sounds). People staring at metro maps are an easy target for pickpockets (as suggested by /u/kihaku1974).
* Google maps is your friend.

I will add some other obvious tips later.

Do you already have a place to stay? Location is important.

If you have any need for more specific help, need someone to guide you around the city or need anyone to speak to (Especially since, in my experience, the english level of the locals is not particularly good) you can PM me or any frequent redditor on this subreddit.

That's exactly the point. The EU has been trying to build a constitution/euronation via treaties, mixing between things that should be two different categories. A free trade deal is vastly different to giving the EU parliament new powers. Sometimes they have acknowledged that the people should actually be asked because that's what's really going on, and that's why their argument falls down. If they'd stuck to ""it's a treaty you don't get a vote"" the whole time they'd at least be consistent. But they prove my point because they have acknowledged in the past that this level of change *should* require a referendum. So I find their backpedaling to the ""it's just a treaty"" when they lose the referendum to be extremely hostile and extremely anti-democratic. Such treaties have no democratic legitimacy.  

Further, if you say the people aren't smart enough to vote on massively important treaties once every couple of decades or once a decade, then how are the people smart enough to vote in normal elections?

So now I need to ring up SFE again and discuss it with them again, telling them again that they are utter cocks and should just approve it and if not, tell me why so that I can perhaps actually sort it out befor having to set up a direct debit with my university to register and face the prospect of having a £5,535 direct debit leave my account, wiping it clean in April and taking me over my overdraft, unless I were to use my grandmother's inheritance.

But the UK is way behind her children who all require a referendum to change their, properly written, constitutions.  

&gt;I look down? Please show me where any of this has been the case.  

The part where you didn't want people to know how MEPs voted on the budget, and your seeming (I hope you prove me wrong) opposition to referendums on the treaties. You can always retract that secret MEP position and support referendums for ""joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance"".

&gt;I'm an EU citizen as well  

Are you a British one? Why should you have any power over our affairs until we have democratically approved this state of affairs with a referendum? It's hardly some kind of crazy British arrogance to merely say my country should decide its own fate. If we sceptics lose a free and fair referendum we'll have to live with that, but it's being delayed until such a time as the europhiles think they can win (hence the very very long delay, over a decade before your first European memories since the last, corrupt, one on the ""common market"").

if you want to talk the legitimacy of the EU project lets do that, but in a different topic, you cannot come up with this argument in any issue connected with EU or Europe, how do you want to make a normal, healthy discussion about pressing topics of european economy if you refuse to talk about the actual points. this post is about problems of externalities and a negative influence of a certain enhanced cooperation (a procedure)

briefly - a certain number of member states can decide that they want to create a further integration in a certain area, if there is no overall EU agreement.. however such cooperation has to be allowed by other member states with a warrant that such cooperation cannot have a negative influence on common market and other member states, who dont want to participate. Based on such approval this group of MS can come up with a proposal of what they actually want to do, in this case UK and the rest of member states think that the proposal for this enhaned cooperation is outside of the boundaries of the warrant they got from the Council (member states) and are trying to challenge that...

But the average person still has to pay them. Of course they can opt not to have kids or take certain insurances and earn more on average that way but still. You may just be a bit more happy knowing you'r safe from a number of risks or by just not having to deal with them. And then there's also the fact that those insurance companies, private pension funds and whatnot overall are probably less/not gov. controlled/regulated. With the markets more loose one could say this leads to lower prices due to concurrence but this is often not the case when big companies control most of the market and some companies trying to dodge their insurance policies to make more money. So in the end the one in Denmark for example would probably pay less for the same level of quality. To say they have no hope of improving their standard of living is thus not necessarily true. Then again some Americans may skip out on some of that risk coverage but when shit hits the fan those won't be adding to the % that feels happy. 

&gt;You get a 10% raise and take home 40% of it.

Is a vast overstatement I think. If the tax structure is somewhat like here in Belgium which also has big taxes then he/she is probably already cashing in big when paying such a high %. very big.

However, it obviously does not solve the real issue - the civil war that is happening in Syria. Air strikes won't end the war, and neither will the  abandonment of chemical weapons.

What I would like to see, and this might be controversial, is Assad requesting military assistance from Russia, to fight the rebels. Similarly to what happened in Mali - the Mali government couldn't handle the terrorists on its soil, they requested help from the Europeans, and France sent its military to fight off the threat, followed by EU training missions. Why not do that in Syria? It is quite clear that some of the major rebel groups are recognised terrorist organisations that will pose a major threat to the region if they come to power. I'd rather prefer Syria to have a stable dictatorship under Assad, than to turn to 1990s Afghanistan, with no functioning government and a breeding ground for terrorist groups that will cause havoc in the Middle East and Europe. 

I would be ready to even say that Europeans should support Assad, but that would cause issues domestically, as well as in relations with other Middle Eastern states that do no support Assad. But giving Russia a silent approval for military assistance for the regime could work.

There's very little political or societal will edging for democratic reform. FPTP was defeated. The Pirate Party in Germany are seen as a joke (and in many cases, rightly so). The public is bombarded with poorly written articles about the EUs 'democratic deficit', ignoring that it's a body created by the member-states to allow them to exert control more directly through the Council of Ministers and the European Council. Most articles I read about the EU are confused messes written by people that have little understanding of how it works, and this distracts people from thinking about domestic voting reform instead onto dealing with the EUs 'democratic deficit'. Advocating a wider democratic debate is all well and good, but nothing would come even close to kickstarting it like a secret vote by MEPs on the budget. If it brought down the EU, so be it so long as it provides a sustained high-intensity societal debate that helps progress democratic systems.

&gt;You also didn't answer about whether EU treaties should be put to the vote in principle (not what historically happened but what should happen from here on in).

In principle, yes. In current practice, no. Given what I just said about media confusion over how the EU functions, combined with the myriad current democratic flaws in member state, (whether to do with the issues you mentioned, above-the-line voting as was a problem in the most recent Australian Senate election), or the refusal to incorporate the increasingly powerful increases in technological communication and computing into how current democratic processes work, I think that democratic reform needs to start within each member-state. Else you run the risk of any future EU changes being seen as 'undemocratic', much as past treaty changes have been, because contemporary democratic practices were far from optimal.

Wer ist wiederum (zum Großteil) dafür verantwortlich? Die Politik und die Politiker, die wiederum davor gewählt wurden.

Ich finde es einfach nur dumm und unverständlich, dass Gabriel das Mädchen da so anfährt - die ist vielleicht 18 Jahre alt, geht noch zur Schule - dann erwartet er, dass sie so viel Ahnung von Politik hat, wie jemand, der z.B. fünf Jahre älter ist und schon studiert oder arbeitet? Ist doch fast klar, dass sie noch keine gefestigte Meinung über alle Politikbereiche hat (und haben kann!). Er vergisst meiner Meinung nach, dass Politik nicht einfach ist (sondern extrem komplex) und man sich schon länger mit etwas auseinandergesetzt haben muss, um ein ungefähres Bild von der politischen Lage zu haben. Insbesondere, weil Wahlprogramme und Handlungsabsichten so unklar wie nie zuvor sind.


Für mich ist es dann auch noch Ironie pur, dass er sagt ""ist doch Ihre Zukunft!"", aber wenn Leute die SPD wählen, ist der Herr Gabriel auch für ihre Zukunft mitverantwortlich - er versucht sich einfach aus der Verantwortung zu ziehen.

true,sir_wolfie,EURO,Union européenne,"I still don't see why you can't just support more democratisation of the EU though and oppose measures that are not democratic rather than ""initiating a crisis"" and hoping it plays out well. It's not a practical position to have such a crisis just to get EU reform. It simply doesn't make any sense.  

In practice you sound like you don't trust the citizens. I can't think of many reforms which would alleviate your problems with democracy here. You seem to want perfectly informed citizens, on your definition of perfect, before you will allow them to vote. Democracy never claims to be perfect, and apparently it's good enough for national elections so I can't see why it's not good enough for referendums once every 10-20 years or more. As I've said elsewhere, any argument against referendums equally applies to elections and we still, for the moment, have them.    

You might think some of the articles against the EU are poorly written, but I think many of them blow holes through the whole project, who is to decide which are the bad ones or not? All campaigns are fought by opposing side who think the others are wrong/illogical/a mess/ignorant, I can't see how you can get around that always being the case. Maybe some equal time/exposure rules? But breaking those rules is what *won* the pro-EU forces the second Lisbon vote in Ireland. They had way more coverage in the papers and on TV than the no side and their campaign was a tissue of lies. There are plenty of pro-EU media in the UK as well, the BBC, the Guardian, the Economist, the Independent, the Financial Times, often the Times and many more. Additionally all three main parties are pro-EU and will campaign for it (there might be a Tory split, but that's still the vast majority of them pro-EU). If they can't make the pro-EU case with that firepower then maybe there isn't a good case to be made and they deserve to lose.  

I think until you can articulate some actual concrete reforms like equal time (and there are some rules from the electoral commission anyway on some of these points) then this is just cover for not wanting a referendum. For example, if your country voted to ditch the queen then I presume you'd support a referendum rather than just parliament doing it without asking because you'd not only want a say in the yes/no but want a yes/no say on the detail, the eventual wording of your constitution and the exact type of system. That's actually in many ways a smaller issue than the referendums the UK should have had in the recent past (as in practice the Queen is irrelevant so it's more symbolic than what the UK has undergone). So if you support a referendum there, which I think you would, then I can't see how you can say various European democracies are not ready for their referendums on the way they are governed on some vague grounds that they're not informed enough and there are some meanies in the press.  

In summary, an argument against referendums is equivalent to one against elections. You pretty much have to support choice on both or be against both as the same factors like ""voters being informed"" and ""problems"" with the media apply. I think if you think to your own country and referendums there, or in the USA, that my claim is a very simple democratic one. Referendums are just one of many reforms, but they cannot be replaced by other reforms, you either have them or you don't, you either support them or you don't. You are either a democrat or you are not.  

TL;DR ""reforms"" at the member state level might be a good thing but they are a separate issue to referendums, you can do both. And regarding referendums they are equivalent to elections, arguments against referendums are also arguments against elections. I can't see how it's possible to be pro-election, and then say all the media and information problems are somehow different for referendums. Also, you have to be consistent in opposing referendums in your own country if you oppose them for other countries.

true,jeanralph,ZBSVUE,U-E,"&gt; Don't say ""tu"" right away. You may know that we have two ways to say ""you"" in french. ""Vous"" is the formal one, for people you don't know really well, or respect in hierarchy. ""Tu"" is used for friends and close family. Although it might seem a little easier to use ""tu"" right at the beginning, you usually have to wait until the other person says it's okay. It's considered rude to be called ""tu"" when you don't know someone.

I've heard about some native English speakers struggling with the tu-vous thing. It actually is pretty straightforward because there is a largely equivalent system in the US:

If you would confidently address a person on a first-name basis back in your home country (or you'd do it if you knew the person's first name), then it's definitely 'tu' that applies here.

If you would consider ending your sentences with 'Sir/Mrs/Ma'am' back home when talking to a person, then it's definitely 'vous'.

The only exception that I can think of would be people working retail who have to wear a badge displaying their first name. I find it better to use 'vous' with them.",0,1378834251,null,0,1378834703,0,cc5lfes,t3_1m2yf3,t1_cc5lfes,t1_cc5crnd,null,1429511566,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

So we have been arguing a different issue to the article proper.  

In your eyes there is a debate over the legality of the FTT, it either is or isn't legal under the current treaties and there are powers at work fighting for it and against it. In contrast my, and I suspect Djmedic's, point is that the treaties themselves are illegitimate, so the question of whether it's correct or not under the treaty is rather uninteresting to us. Things can be legal in China but still their government is not seen as legitimate by true democrats because it's not elected. This is a moral and philosophical argument that rests *outside and above* the legal one with which the article is concerned.  

The Lisbon Treaty is connected because some of the new economic powers have been snatched that way (under a natural disasters clause in one case..), and also because the Lisbon treaty is a prime example of all the other illegitimate treaties which were not voted for.  

If your country was invaded I imagine you'd have less interest in the new imposed legal system of the invaders and how they were going to tax you than overthrowing them. This is a lesser case, as thankfully it doesn't involve violence yet, of that same issue. Poll after poll shows the majority of British people with an expressed opinion on this want to *leave the EU entirely*. People can say ""but your parliament did it"" but again that's a boring legal argument, and we've had referendums on lesser issues anyway so there is strong precedent in a country of convention, the moral and philosophical argument rests *outside and above* that and demands that we have our referendum; and by hook or by crook, we shall have it.",0,1378835529,null,0,false,0,cc5lvon,t3_1m3n8x,t1_cc5lvon,t1_cc5l0l6,null,1429511352,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

true,DFractalH,EURO,Großdeutschland,"It basically boils down to how one quantifies ""top university"". Current rankings usually focus on - lo and behold - data that is easily accessible and widely available, such as research papers produced, quoted, noble laureates, funding, amount of people who applied, etc.

How much that really accounts for top quality research in a particular (sub-)field you are interested in is a question of interpretation. 

It is especially fascinating to see these rankings being used by undergraduates deciding where to go. They're precisely the only demographic in academia who is not affected by research, as long as your field is taught well.

And I believe it's a fool's idea to think that superior research implies superior teaching.

Another problem arising is that this assumes that research is done and funded at university level - a thing that is just not true for countries such as France and Germany who have elite research institutions that aren't universities.

An example of how this gives a false impression is a university that has 'outsourced' most of its research into such an institution, even though the separation is de jure only because they are located in the same building and professors are employed by both the university and institution.

To sum it up, it's a combination of what factors are chosen to quantify ""top university"", and the fact that English-speaking universities *are* on average the best in the world for *research done at universities*. It's no wonder they shine when you take a look at the easily quantifiable stuff in this setting.

If a personal statement is allowed: I believe such rankings are entirely useless. The reason is that undergraduates profit not at all from being told where good research is done, and the ranking itself is too general to tell you where good research in your particular field of interest is conducted. 

It's far more informative to simply ask people who work in a field where the best research is done - chances are at none of the ""top"" universities, because specialisation is a bitch.

Certains problèmes que vous évoquez, eg les différences dans les systèmes de santé US et européens, ne sont pas forcément difficiles à évacuer : dans cette étude, on prend en compte simplement l'espérance de vie qui ne tient pas compte du fait ou non que les citoyens approuvent le système de santé (un américain vivra pas moins longtemps si on le force à avoir un système socialisé), et on peut ajouter des variables qualitatives ou quantitatives pour mesurer la satisfaction avec le système social (ie est que ça fonctionne comme je voudrais ?).

Pour par exemple le poids de la carrière dans le bonheur, on peut aussi évaluer et prendre en compte cela dans les études.

Bien sûr, cette étude et toutes les autres sont fortement limitées et reposent sur des hypothèses forcément réductrices (ie on est plus heureux parce qu'on vit plus longtemps : il y a une hypothèse sous jacente que l'homme désire vivre le plus vieux possible), ça ne veut pas dire que c'est ""idiot"" ou ""impossible"" ou du moins pas plus que toutes les autres objets d'études des sciences humaines.",0,1378839803,null,0,false,0,cc5ngn8,t3_1m3hr9,t1_cc5ngn8,t1_cc5jjjr,null,1429510614,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

A lot of German ""pop culture"", at least when I was there, was borrowed from the U.S. There are various bands as listed below that would be better heard and understood in German than reading subtitles, and maybe some original sources that haven't been translated yet, but the vast majority of things coming out of Germany you could learn and experience with no real base in German at all. 

The biggest thing I'd say you'd have to know German for is to really understand the culture, and I don't say that because the language is imperative to know, but because while studying the language at that level you have no choice but to learn about the vast complexity that is German culture. 

I'm sure I've made Germany seem slightly insignificant with this post which is by no means whatsoever true (quite the opposite in fact). 

Lastly German is extremely hard to learn. Unless you have a burning desire to learn it I'd spare yourself the anguish. Mark Twain on learning German: ""Surely there is not another language that is so slipshod and systemless, and so slippery and elusive to the grasp. One is washed about in it, hither and thither, in the most helpless way; and when at last he thinks he has captured a rule which offers firm ground to take a rest on amid the general rage and turmoil of the ten parts of speech, he turns over the page and reads, ""Let the pupil make careful note of the following exceptions."" He runs his eye down and finds that there are more exceptions to the rule than instances of it.""

I enjoy beer, I like the taste and all. But I am no where near the 100L / year... There are so many people that don't drink beer at all. How many alcoholics are there in mine and other countries :(?

:edit:

Just had a bit of a discussion with friends and once you look at the population pyramid and take away people below 15 years and above 90 years, people that probably don't drink for religious reasons, that don't drink at all and that don't drink beer. We came up with about 45 million people in Germany that need to drink 107L per year.... Now ""normal"" drinkers probably only drink like 1L per week on average. This means there need to be a pretty big chunk of people that do drink at least 1L per day or really heavily on weekends. 

It appears that the public pays more than 25 billion € per year for the aftermath of alcohol (health care, damages from accidents, rehab, etc.)

The worst part is, that there is so little awareness about and at the same time a general acceptance of the drug in our society, when it is so damaging to your body and wallet. Again I like beer and I can remember how cool it was to drink a lot when I was growing up and still is to a certain degree in my social circle.

But if she reads a text, she reads it fluently, with one problem: she's talking like some stereotypical German. ""Hans, I need ze butter now, giff it to meh! Oh my gott, wat are you doing wiff det kneif?"" Every time I have to listen to this I kinda freak out in my head.

A little fun story: I met some Swedish girls in Denmark and talked with them in English, they got everything right: Pronunciation, grammar, they only sometimes forgot some vocabulary. I felt like an idiot when talking with them. One time I said to my friend ""Fick dich."" and she asked what I said and I replied with ""I told him to fuck you.""

true,waterfuck,TRAN,Transylvania,"I split Europe in 3 ways:

by their recent past: The iron curtain splits it in East and West.

Geographically: I personally prefer: 

* France, UK, Ireland, Belgium and Holland in the west

* Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Bulgaria and the Former Yugoslavs in the south

* Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Poland in Central Europe

* Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway in Northern Europe

and

* Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova in Eastern Europe

And then there is the 3rd way I split Europe which is culturally but is more of a historical split because some of the mentalities that I use to make this are basically lost in the modern countries of today. Ok, this is my opinion and I'm not willing to offend anybody please don't downvote me or kill me or whatever. I'll also put a little why.

So here it goes:

* France and the UK+Ireland in the West (because they both had colonies ""recently"" with which that still have strong ties)

* Spain and Portugal in the South West (because they both had colonies before the French and the Brits and they aren't so attached to them)

* Italy in the South(you're all alone :( because you're quite strange if you look at it)

* Greece, Bulgaria, FYROM, Serbia, Albania, Wallachia in the South East (they all have a Ottoman past and history even if some of them are more influenced by it than others)

* Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Transylvania, Slovenia, Croatia, Austria, Tirol, Galicia in the Center South. (yep, the Austrian Empire, well that empire was at least 100 years of this regions history, and some quite recent history too. You can find architectural things in common in almost all the big cities of these countries + some common things like the Hungarian Playing cards and stuff) Maybe Poland here too, I haven't worked that out yet.

* Germany in the Center North(Germany, you're like Italy but in the North) 

* Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark in the north (so much history in common)

* Russia, some Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova in the east.(Die hard Orthodox countries)
 
* Maybe make a region for all the left out countries but I'm not sure about it: Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia. 


Start shitting on me nationalists. Of course Romania is the most split up country because I know the differences between the regions better but I could split other countries up just as well (like the UK, Spain, France, Germany or Italy) but I haven't quite got the big cultural differences between your regions. Like why are the guys from Marseille saying they don't like the north or what's the big difference between a Northern German and a Southern one.

While physics degree holders can be found, they have usually done a subsequent masters in the  finance area.

As a foreigner you will have a hard time landing an job, unless you are doing a degree at their target schools and receiving top grades your only other option is personal networks which obviously you do not have at this point.

In terms of plan of attack:
1. Perfect your German.
2. Enroll in a Bachelors/Masters at WHU or other school with heavy IB connections.

I suppose there are a lot of Hungarians in London (etc) who are only there for a year or two (or three) - as exchange students, au pairs, seasonal workers, or just to quickly make a buck before returning home; so one could argue that they have more of a vested interest in how their home country (to which many of them are likely to return) develops than ethnic Hungarians in Serbia who will likely never live in Hungary. But I agree that's a bit of a stretch. The best and most logical thing would be simply to make it equally easy or hard for any Hungarian citizens abroad to vote -- whether they be expats or ethnic Hungarian minorities with double citizenship.

- Norwegians buy alcohol (and cigarettes) in Sweden to save 20-30%/40-50% on cigarettes.
- Swedes buy alcohol and cigarettes in Denmark - savings of 50%/10%
- Danes buy alcohol in Germany (savings on beer 20-30%, hard liquor up to 40%). Cigarettes are about the same. 

The quantities are arguably larger in Denmark as:

1. Norwegians are severely restricted in what they can bring in. This is a country that notoriously runs out of *butter* at Christmas, for which they are duly mocked in Sweden and Denmark. 

2. Swedes have to pay to cross the water to Denmark. The bridge is 650DKK return ($110ish), making the business case worse.

Il s'agit d'un avis sur un ministre juif, franc-maçon, anti-catholique, fils de banquier ...communiste. Je n'ai effectivement pas de temps à perdre avec Peillon: ceux qui se sont renseignés ont compris à quoi je faisais allusion.

Si tu as une question précise, pose une question précise. Sinon, tu es là pour quoi ?

No, they only insisted on Wallachia and Moldova; I think it's because they were somewhat more independent and ruled by Romanians. But why should this matter? I'm interested in knowing more about the history of this culturally distinct region that I live in, and not only about the other two principalities.

It seems we are taught the history of the Romanian people in a very ideological way that only highlights the similarities between us and ignores what made and still makes us different. Besides, Transylvanian history is way better documented than that of the others anyway. And wouldn't it be better for it to be the history of Romania, including the other ethnicities that have inhabited these lands and still do?

true,zeabu,ANAR,Libertarian municipalist Barcelona,"&gt; I know the meaning of the word, what's the point

That Catalonia *isn't* a colonized country. At one point (1714) we disagreed over the next king, we went to war over it and lost. If there's one thing I couldn't care less about is a stupid king and some stupid royal line. I care more about a bourgeoisie living on the back of the working class (That's a jab at the CiU-slogan). 

The other reasons why Catalonia could claim independence are:

* They feel different. A matter of identity. I could understand that, I mean, it makes sense, but I'm an anarchist and I think governance should not even be region-wise but municipality-wise, in which case both the Spanish state and the Catalan state are over-arching and abundant, knowing that we have a European Union that dictates laws (let's ignore for a moment that the EU isn't democratic).
* Economy. Good reason, but it goes against solidarity. What we have and can/could consider as transfers are not a correct solidarity, and could/should be fixed with a fiscal union and a basic guaranteed income, both on European level (or Euro-US, idealistically on a global level, but we're far from that).
* Instating another economic model. Well, you could swing me with this argument. Problem is, most pro-independence people insists in changing a Spanish state, in favour of a Catalan one, but without touching the institution, nor the economic system, nor breaking with the IMF, keeping the euro and staying within the EU. The only ones in catalonia that insist on changing the economic system are CUP and Esquerra Anticapitalista. Since both of them combined make up less than a few % of the votes/seats, my idea of independence is that it is a scam. Same dog, different collar.

500g spaghetti and 500g sieved tomatoes are like 2€ at most, leaving you with another € you can save for the next day. And 500g spaghetti lasts most people two times, so if you buy another can of sieved tomatoes you're at 3€ for two days of food. Rice and a nice vegetable stirfry is in a price range of 3€. 3x350g pizza costs 2,50€ and lasts you 2-3 days. We're at 8,50€ for 5 or 6 meals right now.

Drinking tapwater certainly helps in these calculations, but our tapwater is better or at least equally as good as bottled water anyway. I haven't bought water in 3 or 4 years.

Cheap but tasty meals are certainly possible. You have to be able to cook a little bit at least, but saying that 100€ a month equals ramen every day is a bit of a stretch, imho.

To answer some of your questions: the medication I'm taking is known as Adderall in the states (amphetamine salts is the generic term). I've tried many other less potent medications commonly used to treat narcolepsy, but Adderall seems to be the only thing that will keep me from involuntarily falling asleep during the day. Healthcare is definitely one of my motivating factors for considering moving to Europe...as a 26 year old college student with no health insurance, just paying for my monthly medication can be hard ($170 USD per month).

As for your response to #6: I've taken a few European history classes at the university, and have covered to some extent how the EU differs from the US from a government standpoint. Though sadly, that's the extent of my knowledge about Europe (however I do actively keep up on current events that make world news). The only language I know is English, but I am planning on picking up a second language in graduate school...I'm just not sure which one would be the most beneficial to me in the future. I currently have no close family over there, but for about 5 years my uncle would commute every couple of weeks to Belgium for work. I stayed at his home in Ghent for two weeks while on vacation with my family 10 years ago. I hope I was able to answer your questions.

Talk to a physician in the country you plan to reside in to clear this issue up. A single consultation should cost less than one month of your medication.

You apparently have extended family in Europe that can help you integrate in your country of choice, take that into consideration. Inform yourself which institutions whether public or private are more accepting of foreign nationals as the headache can discourage them. From personal experience I can say Germany is extremely accepting and many other countries attractive to a physicist should be too.

If you have a real desire to learn a foreign language try moving to a country with a population less willing to speak English, as e.g. in the Scandinavian countries there are plenty of stories told by Americans being unable to learn the local language as 'everyone' spoke to them in English. Compare the climate of your target countries with your local climate to know if you have to prepare for something entirely different, e.g. Californa is quite different from Norway.

To know which countries fit your particular niche in nuclear physics (commercial, academic, martial) you have to ask your advisor. If you do not plan to stay in (nuclear) physics particularly you are more free to choose your location. In general UK/Germany/France/Switzerland are of interest in nuclear physics research.

EDIT: risponde in modo civile, non sempre in modo sensato. in effetti sul fatto che ha scritto che ""l'impresa Grillo metterà in commercio il decoder"" si sta un po' arrampicando sugli specchi

EDIT2: però segnalo questo suo commento:

The last point is not uncontroversial. It could be argued that, at least on the level of the national economy, a country like Greece isn't all that hopeless after all: their GDP is still way above what it was in the 80s and 90s.

But even if you ""only"" have one or two beers a day it will damage your body sooner or later. Your liver needs a couple of days without alcohol (or other toxic substances) every week to regenerate. 

Also: Not only alcoholism is damaging to the healthcare system, you don't need to be fucked up all the time to damage your body (see above). 

I think your example of /r/showerbeer proves my point, that alcohol, especially beer and wine are widely accepted to not be dangerous, especially in small dosage. Your other example of your social circle drinking beer like a normal beverage is exactly what I was trying to explain in my earlier post. It is just normal to drink when you meet people and I understand why it is that way. It's still playing with fire in the long term.

I had a good friend that started to drink more and more and eventually, yes, he started drinking in the shower. He's a wreck now and you can't really hang out with him any more, but I'm glad he's starting to realise what happened.

Of course it's easy to find faults in the Greek administration (and that would be correct), but the truth is that the downfall of the Greek economy was caused by austerity, which was a natural response to the rise in interest rates (reaching a peak of 39% in 2012), which were due to investment banks thinking that Greece is the weakest link of the Eurozone.
