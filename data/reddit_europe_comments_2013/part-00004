This is the whole point, you can't arrest an ambassador. It doesn't matter what they've just done. You can complain to their country's foreign ministry, call them in to explain themselves, even expel them back to their home country, even sever diplomatic relations entirely. But you can't arrest them.

&gt; Obviously, I think the police officers could have handled this a bit better, but it doesn't change the fact that the ambassador believed that the rules don't apply to her.

The rules apply to her and she is meant to follow them but the local police have no power in enforcing them over the person of an ambassador. Only her home country can take her to task. No matter what she has done, even killed someone. This is rare, but it has happened more than once, including in the UK where Libyan embassy staff [murdered a police officer in London and were never prosecuted.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Yvonne_Fletcher) This led to Britain completely severing diplomatic relations with Libya, but the diplomats were allowed to leave without being arrested.

Israel und der Sicherheitsrat (aka Veto-Show) wäre ein interessantes Thema in dem Zusammenhang z.B.

&gt; Der Gedanke, dass die Israelis gemessen an den Verhältnissen, unter denen sie zu operieren gezwungen sind, sehr viel richtig machen, ist für Dich schlicht a priori ausgeschlossen.

Nein ich werfe dir Dualismus vor weil du mit einem Dualismus argumentierst der sogar mich einbezieht. Wie ich auch oben schon in den Zitaten bzgl. der Israelkritiker gezeigt habe. Niemand zwingt dich zu behaupten, daß Israelis und Palästinenser (gibt es nicht) in gleichen Maße für den Konflikt verantwortlich wären. Wo habe ich das den behauptet?

Du hast statt dessen nur in Verallgemeinerungen gesprochen. Es ging zwischendurch um mich und was ich alles denke. Es ging um Gruppen die eh immer das lesen was sie lesen wollen und deshalb sowieso keine brauchbare Meinung zu irgendeinem Thema abliefern können. Dann ging es um Afrika und Nordkorea. 

Klar wir können jetzt weiter mit Verallgemeinerungen um uns schmeißen, es wird dennoch nichts an den Tatsachen ändern. Augstein ist nun Antisemit. Egal wer was sagt. Der Mann ist verbrannt. Es ist der einfachere Weg als sich mit Grenzen der ""Israelkritik"" auseinanderzusetzen. Es ist auch der einfache Weg den du mit den obigen Verallgemeinerungen genommen hast. Diese schwammige Masse an Medienkonsumenten wird diese Klassifizierung dann noch immer nicht verstehen und nachvollziehen können was nur weiter zur weiteren Verschlimmerung der Situation führen wird. Das wird genau aus diesen Gründen weiterhin Journalisten die nicht sowieso schon ""vordeklariert"" sind, sich kritisch zu Israel zu äußern.

Da sind wir auch bei dem was ich mit dem ersten post sagte.

I'll just address one thing though, the Poland-Lithuania/Austria-Hungary thing.

Yes, you can probably point out a bunch of countries which weren't generally styled Empires but which fit some of the characteristics. But that's not really a reason to throw out the term Empire altogether, which you kinda have to at that point. What makes the French Empire more of an empire than the Russian Empire? Or the Ottoman Empire? Mughal Empire? Seleucid, Parthian, Sassanid Empires? It might seem arbitrary, but I personally don't think it's an issue. It's just history.

true,pede83,null,null,"Germany is a federal republic and consists of 16 states (the ""Länder"" or ""Bundesländer""), that form this federation. there are big ones like Bavaria or Brandenburg and also three city states (Berlin, Hamburg,Bremen), that are as sovereign as the others. All states have their own Primeministers and parlaments and they also have a common parlament (the ""Bundesrat"", which is the second chamber in our constitution next to the ""Bundestag"") And here we come to the federal government. The federal government is ruled by the chancellor (Angela Merkel) and is dealing with with all things, that are listed in the constitution. But our constitution lists a lot of things, that the ""Länder"" are responsible for (the ""Ländersachen""), e.g culture and education or the police. The ""Länder"" can charge certain taxes and make their own laws in the parlaments and they also take part in the legislation of the federal laws via the ""Bundesrat"". Every German law that has consequences in the states (for instance in terms of their budget), has to pass ""Bundesrat"" and ""Bundestag"", so around 2/3 of all federal laws have to be passed with the consent of the majority of the 16 states.

Why do we actually have these 16 states? Germany derives from the Holy Roman Empire, which constisted of more than a thousand differen entities (e.g. independent cities like Hamburg, Kingdoms like Saxony or Bishopries like Cologne....more than a thousand! that is called German ""Particularism"". Over the course of the centuries most of these often really small states became part of the bigger states. After the age of Napoleon and the congress of Vienna in 1815 only 35 states remained. This changed not so much until the Nazis came to power and changed the map through a centralistic structure. After world war II the allies decentralised Germany again. The western part of Germany consisted of 10 states and West-Berlin (which had a special status). With the reunification the former GDR was transformed into five states (the ""Neue Länder"") and Berlin became a proper state as well. That is the 16 states of today.

In the future, some states may merge to save money (e.g. Berlin and Brandenburg). 

Also, some regard the Mediterranean Island of Mallorca as the 17th state as it is full of German tourists every summer.

true,pede83,null,null,"damn. know I read your addition. Well, you can see in my first post, that these states have a very different heritage. and I can only outline some major differences. you should specify what you find really interesting.

North vs. South: 

the southern states (Bavaria, Baden-Würrttemberg and Hessen mainly) are catholic, the north is protestant.

also, the south has very distinct dialects, whereas the north has a more common language (but also dialects, just not so different from each other than the ones spoken in the south)

the north is mainly flat. ""Norddeutsches Tiefland"" and has coastal line. the south is more hilly and has proper mountains.

The south has way more money and a low unemployment rate. The south tends to be more conservative.

A friend once said, that the cultural differences between the German states and their prejudices were very tough until our public broadcasting channels (that had programs for the states and not nationwide) was also broadcasted in the other states. So people from Bavaria would watch the program from the north, learn more about them etc and vice versa.


East (the former GDR) vs West (the whole ""western"" states, including the south): 

It is only one generation since reunification.

In an article called ""Greece's Rotten Oligarchy"" he keeps talking about himself and his persecution for something that is, in my opinion, dubious. He published a list with names that haven't been accused (let alone convicted) of anything, thus starting a witch hunt.

I am all for the punishment of those who actually had illegitimate funds sent to Swiss bank accounts, but that list belonged to a prosecutor, not to the public. Presumption of innocence and all. I wouldn't even go as far as publishing only the names of the guilty. I would like it if the names of those that end up on trial were published. And yet this guy outright publishes a list and everyone afterwards starts calling those on the list ""criminals"". Sure some definitely are. Quite likely that all of them are. But that's a downward spiral that has led to the horrors that Golden Dawn does and wants to do.

Oh, and this guy was doing his thing for many years while on government payroll. After he made his name as a journalist in a private network, he was hired by the government network. And since we're on a witch hunt, let me just say that a lot of the scandals with jobs being freely given to ""supporters"" can be traced to government media...no, no, I am not suggesting anything...

Much like how the United States is often culturally split up into south, east/west coasts, and the midwest, Germany has a similar system. However there are obviously different categories; Just off the top of my head I would say that Bavaria, Northern Germany, Berlin, East Germany, and Central Germany are the main groups. 

* Bavaria: What most non-Europeans think of when they hear the word ""Germany"". Bavarian culture is VERY different from the rest of Germany, to the point where there have been [talks of Bavaria seceding from Germany and becoming their own country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria_Party). Bavarian food is basically sausage, potatoes, and pretzels all the time, every day. Which is completely okay, because if there is anyone who understands pretzels, it is a Bavarian. It is the Bavarians who wear lederhosen and dirndls and celebrate Oktoberfest (Wiesn) at the end of September every year. These are the jolly, beautiful germans portrayed in pretty much ever American film that has ever referenced the Fatherland. Unfortunately this is not an accurate representation of the rest of the country whatsoever.
* Northern Germany: Encompasses pretty much everything from Lower Saxony upwards (in my opinion), with the exception of Berlin, which is its own special case. After living here for the past six months, I can tell you from experience that Northern Germany is basically where the worst parts of the '90s came to die. I have never seen more denim in my entire life, and that includes [the denim suit that Justin Timberlake wore to the 2001 American Music Awards.](http://www.innergeek.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/34446411.jpg) People here would eat that shit up. There is a lot more fish included in the diet up here, but they're still totally bananas about potatoes. Socially, northern Germans tend to be a lot more cold and withdrawn, which can be easily misinterpreted as ""spiteful, sarcastic assholes"", but this is not the case. If you put in the work to get to know them, it is worth the effort. 
* Berlin: Hipsters. Hipsters everywhere. The capital of Germany is also the mecca for alternative folk, and I have yet to experience anything like it anywhere else in the world. Kind of like the London of mainland Europe, there is a healthy mix of responsible adults just trying to get their work done and rowdy teens/young adults trying to find themselves. The best place to go if you want to soak up some culture or experience something new, but it is definitely an outlier in terms of German culture. 
* East Germany: Think Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony, Brandenburg, and Thuringen. For the most part these are the poorer areas of the country (Thank you, communism!), but that's not to say that they have nothing to offer. Saxony, for example, has Dresden, which is by far the most beautiful city I have ever seen. These areas have culture, it is just more traditional and laid-back (at least from what I've experienced).
* Central Germany: I guess this would be better described as ""West-Central Germany"". Hesse, Nordrhein-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, and Saarland would all be included in this, and having never visited any of them, I don't know if I can properly describe them. At least from what I've read, they seem to have a healthy mix of industrial and agricultural interests, and some good places to visit to check out the culture would be Frankfurt, Mainz, Dusseldorf, and Cologne. Fun useless fact: Hesse is currently the only German state that permits the death penalty in its constitution, even though it is forbidden by German law.

Fair warning, it gets pretty dark, particularly in the second season. 

The swedish show ""Solsidan"" is a innocent and funny comedy, although a lot of the funny in it comes from the scandinavian contradiction that you should not flaunt wealth, yet we are to petty not to do so. 

And what I would say is one of the funniest show I have ever seen is ""Clown"" from Denmark. Its made like a dogme movie (or at least, it has the same feel to it, they brake like nine out of the ten or so rules for dogme). It is really... Dark is probably the best word to describe it (in one episode, the main characters pressure one of their friends into shooting heroin). 

Also, the general british bunch, ""only fools and horses"", ""monty python"", ""fawlty towers"", ""black adder"", etc.

Also, the serialisation of Dickens ""Great Expectations"" is supposed to be pretty decent. Also ""Shameless"", except I think the american version might have the edge on this one, due to higher production value and slightly better actors. Although the british version is slightly more edgy.

Restaurants I would definitely check out:

L'assiette: bomb traditional french cuisine. A must go.

Le Severo: Paris isn't known for its steaks, but this restaurant has the best, hands down. Make a reservation because it is tiny.

Cafe Lou Lou: get the beef cheek if they are offering it.
 
Les Fils de la Ferme: prob my least favorite, but still unstoppingly delicious.

La mere agitee: I think that is the name... its basically someones kitchen. It's a set menu and all you can drink wine for thirty euros. Need I say more?

There are many many more, but these stand out the most.

Nightlife:

Rue didot. It's close to Denfert, prob the biggest night life street in the 14th, but again, the 14th isnt really known for nightlife.

Cafe Oz: next to denfert and probably the only place that will be open after 1230.

L'entrepot: sweet concert venue/beer garden/movie theatre

Markets:

Rue mouton duvernet every tuesday and friday morning till around one. They will also have occasional antique markets here.

Again, there is much much more than this just in the 14th, not to mention Paris in general. Enjoy and soak it all in, because you're going to have a great time.

""På spåret"" (""On Track"") is one of the longest-running shows on Swedish television, and is generally the most watched show any given week it's airing. The show shows clips of journeys (train rides etc.) while the presenter reads out hints about the destination. The two teams (made up of celebrities) are then to guess where they are going as quickly as possible to score the maximum amount of points. Once they ""arrive"" there are a series of questions about the city, country, culture or an industry they are famous for. The hints are usually made up of wordplay and historical events, so it might be tricky to follow if you don't speak Swedish.

""Så ska det låta"" (""How t Should Sound"") is also a competition between two teams, here usually a mix of comedians and artists. There are a number of rounds all based on knowing music.

I visit home Budapest (now living in Vienna) every month and see no insularity: it is still McDonalds and David Guetta everywhere. What I see is the general anxiety of people not having jobs / their jobs hanging on a thread. I see this extremely depressed vibes of people who 10 years ago tried to be succesful and now they are just trying to survive. Not sure whose fault, I figure MSZP, Fidesz, the world economy all share the blame. Everything else seems to be much less important. There is little insularity visible, in fact the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visegr%C3%A1d_Group mentality is still going strong and nowadays people are even more likely to find jokes like ""my nephew is older than Slovakia"" jokes distasteful than before.

What I think is really happening culturally - and it is not even political, it partially started under the MSZP - that a country that only aped Western customs with a huge sense of inferiority now trying to be a bit prouder and reinvent its own national culture. More and more pride in food (sausage) and wine and palinka products, more festivals of this kind, more pride in horseback riding, less and less self-hatred and hopeless epigonism. I rememeber when almost every band in Hungary was call ""our version of X"" where X is a famous American or British band. As most of them were copycats.

Our system is a mix of government funding and a vast array of health insurance companies. 

There are two major options you may choose under certain circumstances.

1.) **compulsory health insurance ('Public Plans')**  - called GKV (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung)

Now this doesn't mean the 'government' (such as the NHS in the UK). Public plans (and this is very loosely translated, mind you) means your employer enrolls you with a health insurance provider of you choosing and pays a certain percentage of your wage in premiums. These premiums are split a certain way between you and your employer so each has a part to pay, however your share (~13% iirc) is automatically deducted from your paycheck. This is considered a compulsory or obligatory insurance, meaning this has to happen and you cannot choose not to (unless under very certain circumstances).

If you are not employed you may enroll for a family plan, provided you are married to your SO and she is employed (?). If that is not the case you may choose to voluntarily enroll (again, loose translation; ""Freiwillig versichert""). Not sure on the costs, but they should be nowhere near to what you are used to from the US.

It is important to notice that there is no such thing as **pre-existing conditions** in the compulsory health insurance system. A company cannot refuse to insure you. It's, like many things in Germany, based on solidarity, meaning everyone pays the same premium percentages and the 'not-so-sick' pay for the sick and, in theory, it breaks even. 

2.) **The 'private plans'** - called PKV (Private Krankenversicherung)

This term is a little misleading, since the insurance companies under 1.) are private companies aswell, the only difference is that the receive government funding on some levels. 
They are much more expensive and they will calculate their insurance rate based on age, gender, occupational risks, pre-existing conditions and so forth. 
They do however give you additional benefits and services, such as single-room occupancy (in hospitals), depending on your plan.
The problem is, once you're in the PKV system you cannot go back to GKV. Only under a very limited set of circumstances.
I could go on about PKV, but in essence it's not necessary and I strongly advise against it for your needs.

So in summary, if you are married, then ask for a family plan, if not then choose a GKV insurance and enroll for a voluntary insurance plan (Freiwillige Versicherung), as long as you are not employed and once that happens you're out of the woods anyway, since than it becomes mandatory.

Apart from that, I hope you enjoy Germany :)

This is laughable cause it's more or less exactly what happened in the early 80s and led to the current situation.

The Spanish company can afford it, at least currently; its balance at its local bank is enough to cover the purchase.

However, the TARGET2 system is an accounting system more than it is a transfer system. The Bundesbank has a *claim* against the ECB, and the ECB in turn has a claim against Banco de España. If a Bundesbank obligation comes due, and it turns to the ECB, and the ECB turns to the Spanish bank, what happens if the Spanish bank can't cover it? Well... the Bundesbank is out of luck, because there's nothing to collect.

They're lazy, they're not working enough, they're taking too many benefits and, as a combination of all those, they're not productive enough.

Nowadays, productivity has little to do with how hard-working are the workers. It is all about technology. The average Swedish industrial worker produces 50 times the value that the average Indian worker produces not because he's more hard-working (it's likely the other way around, as workers less developed countries work more hours), but because he uses better technology. And this is not the fault of the Indian, nor the merit of the Swede.

There are multiple options for dealing with this. 2/3 of your countrymen (as of 11/2012) still don't support the right to choose to have an abortion in cases where the mother's life isn't threatened. That's just really, really backward.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"As for the thread in /r/politics, I have no idea what kind of jobs they had. But for virtually any job that is decent, most companies start off at 2 weeks (the cnn article says 2-3 weeks) plus 11 paid holidays, which brings the number up to 3.5-4.5 weeks of paid vacation time. While it's true that this doesn't match Europe, it would be disingenuous to say that we hardly get any time off. Also, this is what people start off with when they start at a company. Usually after the first year or so, successive half weeks or whole weeks are added (although there is a cap obviously, if you work at the same company for 20 years, I doubt they'd give you 6 months off).

As for the working more than 40 hours, workers are broken into 2 categories, hourly and salary. Hourly usually get paid time and half after 40 hours, and between 60 hours. After that it usually doubles (i say usually because this varies state by state, and company by company, but it's broadly true).

As for salary, you just get paid for 40 hours, regardless if you go over or under (although it's rarely under). Some companies will pay time and a half for anything over 50 hours if you are salary, once again, this depends on the company. My company does not do this. But since it is almost a given that you have worked over forty hours, you can usually request time off and it won't be counted against your vacation. Just a few weeks I took a thursday and a friday off for a wedding, and it wasn't part of my vacation since my net hours that I worked were approximately 80 hours for that pay period.

Just like those stories in that thread were anecdotal, so is mine. But I would pretty much guarantee you that the 2-3 weeks plus 11 holidays are much more common. This applies mostly for any job that isn't being a cashier at McDonald's. I can't speak for those employees.

But anyway, when I see that the average European gets 4 weeks off, I look at my 3.5 weeks, and don't see too wide of a gap.

&gt;That's why they got introduced in the first place, practically everywhere long before the EU directive was introduced.

They're still inefficient and it's still no reason to implement them on a EU level. The UK is fully right in that this isn't wise regulation and that it should be abolished.

&gt;For highly skilled professionals, vacation days are a part of the compensation package just like their salaries

As they should be.

&gt;but for others it's very different. In many companies vacation days are a perk you get after staying with the company for a couple of years, if at all.

What about it, if both parties agree to it? The moment someone isn't pleased about his labour contract, he can try to renegotiate it to get more vacation time or he can just terminate the contract and work somewhere else to get better terms.

Again, this type of regulation fails to achieve its goals, it does not prevent anything that comes close to a ""race to the bottom"" (a demonstration of this is that there are companies that are still competitive and whose workers get more than the minimum amount of vacation required - if the minimum was preventing any such thing, you'd expect everyone to give the just bare minimum required by law), it's added expenses for companies who don't work under this system (companies whose wages might be higher but give less benefits such as these) and it distorts the free market, making it more inflexible.

For example, there's a company that pays one worker 6000€/month and gives him 15 days of paid vacation and pays another worker 5000€/month and gives him 25 days of paid vacation, and everybody is ok with this, why should this company have to renegotiate the labour contract of the first worker to give him more time of vacation in order to comply with the law? The company will either have to lower the wage of the first worker or it will have to cut costs elsewhere or it will simply have to raise the price of the final product, you know that this extra time of vacation won't come into existence simply because there's regulation in that sense, that someone has to pay for it. As you must know by now, there ain't no such thing as a free lunch.

Trust me, I'd love to know exactly where's the net benefit for society. If you know where it is, please tell me.

true,[deleted],null,null,"You are right about the source of productivity. Productivity is the value of goods produced per effort (in hours, or salaries) to other people - and very much unrelated to how diligent or hard workers the workers are.

If there are two chair factories, and the marketing manager at one of them decides to paint the chairs pink with blue flowers, but the other just plain black - then the workers at the first one are unproductive because almost nobody wants to pay for pink chairs with blue flowers, no matter how hard they work.

I agree completely that it is wrong to blame common workers for unproductivity. But the complex social problems arise from the fact that both the workers at the pink and black factories are doing the same jobs, working just as hard, and therefore feel entitled to the same pay or standard of living. But no matter how hard the workers are, the factory making ugly chairs just does not sell enough of them to be able to afford salaries that match the factory with a competent marketing manager. It's no fault of the workers, but if there are no customers, where is the fair pay going to come from?

In case of the factories, the problem is solved by workers getting jobs at the competent one at higher pay, and the one with shitty management going out of business. Individual people can choose jobs where their effort is most productive (and can be therefore be paid the most), and leave useless jobs because customers are not willing to pay for it.

But I'm not sure what the solution could be in the case of government organisations, or countries and economies as a whole. What do you do when there are no competent and honest managers to choose from (or willing to take the job), no possibility of replacing departments that are not doing useful work with something else, no outsiders willing to donate cash just for the fun of it, but people still want to be paid based on their effort, not the value of the results of their work?",0,1357584450,null,0,1357584747,0,c7splcg,t3_1646b0,t1_c7splcg,t1_c7snfal,null,1430886080,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

&gt; they generate less value with the same amount of time/work, thus the market rewards them with less money.

What you say is correct, but what I mean is that it's not the workers' fault that they get to live in a less developed country. I just mean that we should not look at the workers when we want to find someone to blame.

And even if they generate the same value with the same amount of time/work, the pay scale is different. The same auto industry worker would get (after taxes) 2000€ in France, 500€ in Romania, 250€ in Morocco and 100€ in India.

Not that I know of. In any case the Greek elite are not politicians, they are mostly businessmen who are spoon fed by the state. Politicians are mostly rubbertamping officials.  Since the old elite controls the media, you have to go through them to get any kind of exposure. How exactly are you going to fight virtual monopolies in the Greek Market (e.g. oil) without large scale upheavals ? 

To make things worse, the Greek electorate is used in a process of instant gratification. Since none can deliver the promised land tomorrow, to the average Greek every politician looks the same. 

Right now I don't think the Greek people are ready for any kind of change that requires any form of active struggle, no matter how small it is. It will be at least 20 years before anything like that is possible.

At the cost of a lower income at the end of the year. If people (with lower qualifications or not) want to spend more time on holidays and not working, they're always free to do such, they only need to reach an agreement together with their union and their employer.

Forcing everybody to have a certain number of days on vacation when even themselves might favour the alternative of working is highly inefficient and contrary to the principles of contractual freedom.

&gt;have time to consume (shopping, movies, restaurants)

People always have time to consume.

&gt;because it lowers health care cost

How so, if the healthcare is the same?

&gt;because more people are needed to fill the jobs.

That's dumb, it would be like saying ""it takes 8 hours for 1 gardener to clean a park, but instead of hiring 1 gardener for 8 hours or instead of employing 8 gardeners each for 1 hour, we'll employ 96 gardeners each for 5 minutes - society will benefit because more people will work"". Yes, more people will work, but each people will work less, it's not generating more wealth, the wealth is the same, it's just distributed among more people. Which one could argue is a good thing but let's not forget these people wouldn't be sitting on their thumbs if it wasn't for this, there's the opportunity cost, if these new people are now needed for the job as cashiers then it's some other job which will lose out on workers and will stop being done.

&gt;In Germany the historic development was the introduction of the six day work week at ten hours per day in 1900 (down from 72h/week and 82h before that), the eight hour day in 1918/19, the five day work week in 1955/56 and finally the 40-hour week in 1965. Nowadays it's up to 42h.

Right, and there's a reason for that, and it's not because of the good will of politicians or at the expense of companies, it's because employers themselves know that it's more productive to don't overstretch the time its workers spend on the job.

You think a worker is as productive on its 2nd hour or 4th at work as he is on its 8th or 10th or 12th hour? Not even close!

People aren't machines, people get tired and distracted and they're less of a benefit for their employer like that. Also, they also have lives of their own and demand increased compensation for overtime.

Just like in everything else, the marginal utility diminishes over time and the marginal cost increases. The free market itself establishes an equilibrium which is best for both parties involved, the government stepping in and limiting these can only lead to inefficiency.

I still fail to see the net benefit for society when the government steps in and says there should be a minimum of x and y for the workers, if the workers want that, they're free to reach an agreement on their own terms with their employer like they always, there's no point at all on imposing this on everybody and having everybody paying for the added expense of extra vacation days or less work hours for some workers when these workers themselves value the extra compensation more than they value the extra time in vacation or at home (because if they didn't, they'd have reached an agreement with their employers and would be working less for a reduced wage as well).",0,1357588215,null,0,false,0,c7sqtbi,t3_16272l,t1_c7sqtbi,t1_c7sp1o3,null,1430886654,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Honestly, the quality of cable programming in the states these days just can't be matched on the other side of the pond. The only thing worth bringing up really is the aforementioned Scandinavian crime and political dramas: The Killing (Forblydelsen), Borgen and the Bridge. Also worth checking out is Wallander - there's also an English language remake for the BBC starring Kenneth Brannagh that I actually kind of prefer.

We do have some really good comedians and satire, though, some of which holds up outside of the country borders. Much like in the UK or the US we have a strong tradition to mock the powers that be that goes back hundreds of years. 

The best example of Dutch humour that is universally appealing would be Toren C. It's kind of like an absurdist British sketch show mixed with The Office. It's about recognizable characters in unorthodox, usually very embarassing situations. Award-winning and sold to many countries. If you like absurdist British humour, you'll absolutely love this. Look it up on Youtube. For some of these clips, you do not need to know any Dutch to laugh your ass off.

Comedian Hans Teeuwen has performed in English in London and has a type of humour suitable for not just the Dutch. If you like really politically incorrect and absurd shock humour in general, look no further than this weirdo. You can probably find that English show in a torrent somewhere.

Another show I really enjoy myself is Man Bijt Hond. It is a show about average people, leading average lives that usually turn out to have a strange story to tell or a bizarre hobby. Usually they just ring a local door bell or talk to complete strangers on a random sopping street. Many of the items are rooted in current affairs, but there's always some weird twist or unexpected surprise going on. Instead of the usual politicians and experts, these guys put Average Joe's take on the news in the forefront, often with hilarious and surprising, if a little embarassing results. It's hard to explain, you need to see it for yourself. The Dutch version is great but the Flemish original is even better.

Speaking of the Flemish, they are coughing up one hilarious show after the other. Check out Neveneffecten, De Slimste Mens Ter Wereld, Basta, Man Liberation Front and Zonde van de Zendtijd if you can get them with subtitles. They are pure gold.

true,uututhrwa,null,null,"It is even more of a mess, in Greece the ""workers"" lost track of what the long term consequences will be like. There is actually a high level of education in Greece, still not much R&amp;D, cause the whole place isn't organized enough. Some kind of social contract on thinking long term is necessary before you go all R&amp;D, in Greece there isn't much of that attitude, everyone goes for the short term (often backdoor) deal that will benefit him fast. 

If you go to a Physician and he's like ""I'll give you a 15% lower price if you take no receipt"", almost everyone is going to accept, in the short term both parties only gain, in the long term we end up owing to the whole continent.

Say some German official did a study according to which it takes 3x people in the ""local municipal governments"" to do the same amount of work in Greece, than in Germany. Is it because Greeks are ""lazy""? Off course not, it's cause some politician just balls out hired 3x more people than needed, in the short term he gets the votes and they get the wages, in the long term we all lose cause our economy isn't productive enough. And the people choosing whom to vote would almost always go for him and the beaurocratic job guaranteed to pay fast than someone promising future gains.

I believe there is some kind of social psychology behind it all, there is an attitude of ""money comes through adding value more efficiently"" vs ""it comes from fighting for a right against the elite owning it"" (the truth depends on the situation and probably is in the middle, but the thing is if you only go with the second approach you can very easily end up dysfunctional) The problem in greece isn't the ""lazy workforce"", it's that we can't trust each other or think long term.

true,cb43569,SCOT,Scottish Socialist Republic,"I'd have to disagree with you there. You're not ""giving up your country"" to be ruled from Brussels if you're supporting a stronger EU; you're simply supporting more mutually agreed policies relating to trade, human rights, and so forth, many of which are beneficial to all parties involved. Small states empower their electorate, because their people directly elect the government; take Scotland, for instance, where its own parliament would be entirely elected by the people of Scotland upon independence, whereas today it still answers to Westminster, where 59 of 650 seats are elected by the people of Scotland.

I think, for one thing, you need to observe that any country has the right to withdraw from the EU, so nobody is forced to remain a member. The devolved Scottish Parliament cannot withdraw from the United Kingdom, even though a nationalist party has an absolute majority; it has to wait for a referendum, which the UK government wasn't even obliged to provide. On the other hand, a Eurosceptic party receiving an absolute majority in an EU country can immediately begin the process of pulling out. Therefore, I don't really feel that you're giving up any sovereignty by remaining in an increasingly integrated EU.

And, finally, there's a big difference between culture and political thought. If there are massive differences in public opinion between one region of a country and the rest of it, then why can't the people of that region exercise their right to self-determination and declare independence? It will relieve tension in both of the successor states: both will have a parliament (or other governmental structure) that satisfies the will of the two new states' people.

true,Maginotbluestars,SCOT,Scotland,"I'll try to answer this although it wont be popular - it's complicated, but the simple explanation comes down mostly to money. 

1. There are not enough Social workers. Caseloads are huge. 

2. Social workers are human. They fuck up. So do police, hospitals, doctors and teachers - its not not usually carelessness but overwork (see above), the fact that each service has its own processes that don't always match up, and each person involved only tends to see a bit of the overall picture. Very often *in retrospect* there was enough information across a variety of agencies to indicate there was a problem, and all these organisations have been trying to improve things over the last few years.  However this remains a very hard to do in real time effectively. It's also very expensive. It would also be a bit scary and Orwellian. 

3. Abusive parents lie. They don't allow access to children. They sometimes move from one area into another and don't tell social services. Social work departments don't have the resources of an intelligence agency.

4. Removing children from parents is a last resort for a number of good reasons. Numerous studies have shown that children's homes are almost always worse for kids than being brought up by a relative. (well, usually). 

Social workers *also* get a lot of flack when they remove kids before something bad happens. Yes, sometimes they get that decision wrong too but they are pretty much dammed if they do and dammed if they don't. 
Generally they are pretty well educated people driven by a need to help people. Almost all of them could earn far more working in the private sector. They do their very best with limited resources. They darned well are not there for the prestige and level of societal respect they get. (zero, with a side order of crucifixion when they mess up) Give them more funding, more manpower and they could do more ... although it will never be perfect.

- With Guesser Boss &amp; Guesser Worker: The worker communicates through the course of daily interaction the reasons why he thinks he needs/deserves a raise. The boss is capable of ""reading between the lines"" to see that the worker would like a raise. The boss will either give the raise (without the worker directly requesting it) or communicates (indirectly through daily interaction) why it will not be possible. The relationship is unaffected.

- With Asker Boss &amp; Guesser Worker: The worker communicates through the course of daily interaction the reasons why he thinks he needs/deserves a raise. The boss doesn't get the message. The worker wonders why he doesn't get any feedback, or considers the boss to be aloof or clueless. The worker begins to feel resentment. The boss wonders why the relationship with the worker has become colder.

- With Guesser Boss &amp; Asker Worker: The worker directly asks the boss for a raise.

Here is a video explaining how the process works from someone who was an ""economic hitman"" for the IMF during the 80's. - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQpSq8dkzfg

1. They stack greece with debt
2. Much of this debt can never be repaid so it is  ""re-structured"" in return for access to reserves of oil/gas/minerals etc.

Germany is smart, they know they need to have a supplier of gas/oil to sustain there growth the next 50-100 years.

What they did is the classic IMF scheme . . load greece with massive debt on insane interest rates.

do them a ""favor"" by re-structring debt in return of Natural Gas(in greece's case) for pennies on the dollar.

THAT'S PART OF THE SYSTEM - much of this debt was never meant to be paid back, that is why they loaded it with unacceptable interest rates. The main goal is for the debt to get so out of control, greece has no use but to hand over there natural gas/oil supplies.

IMF has been doing this for decades all over the world.",0,1357597067,null,0,false,0,c7stue6,t3_164rrd,t1_c7stue6,t1_c7stjej,null,1430888086,-10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-10

I posit that without a healthy dose of criticism and satire no religion is capable of reforming itself. For example, the very first hindu and sikh mmigrants to UK consisted of whisky/rum drinking chaps who lampooned the more orthodox practices of people back home. Many hindu and sikh authors are openly 'anglophile' (for lack of better term), and still maintain their religious identity. In muslims, the second and third generations are instead reviving the backward orthodox practices to create an identity for themselves.

It is getting so retarded that Hindus and Sikhs requested that BBC not use the term Asian in some cases. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18092605

&gt; Groups representing Sikh and Hindu communities have complained about the term ""Asian"" being used to describe the men involved in grooming trials.

&gt; It says the reluctance of the media and the government to discuss the ""disproportionate representation of Muslims in such cases"" and the fact victims are ""almost always non-Muslim girls"" is adding to the cause of far-right groups such as the BNP.

&gt; It said blanket use of the word ""Asian"" was ""unfair to other communities of Asian origin"".

&gt; ""We believe that in this case the government itself is sanctioning the use of term Asian as a way of clouding responsibility,"" the groups say.

When other brown skinned people are distancing themselves from you, then it is no longer about racism.

Christian priests can easily be portrayed as whore chasers/patrons on TV, so no reason why a hindu/sikh/muslim/buddhist priest not be shown the same way. We need more exercise of free speech, not less.

true,literocola431,null,null,"Hey, so I did this after college, except I went to Rome. I found a site wantedinrome.com with English teaching jobs but almost all
Of them were seeking instructors with work visas or residence citizenship in the eu. That means us poor Americans get passed over for jobs in favor of the Brits, despite not speaking English as well as us, they get jobs because the eu wants to keep its jobs.

I got an online certification for tefl or toefl which was not necessary in my case, but helped to illustrate the proper approach to teaching English in a foreign language. Can do a course and get certificate for 190$$. Lots of these programs offer job placement for extra money, don't do it, more often than not its a job posting board with a bunch of dead links. Find work on your own!

I had no luck in schools, though I know some who have. Many times schools of foreign language are controlled more closely by the Italian government, and thus have to be stricter about who they offer employment to. Expect scattered classes across your weeks schedule if you do find work there.

I'll tell you what I did, you can go this route or not, but for your information: all of those sites mentioned above have other listings as well, secretaries, office worker, bar/event promoter etc. which may not be as glamorous to you, but deal with much less scrutiny from the government, so can give work to undocumented folks. The economy may suck there but the tourism and fashion industry are Alive and well, and hiring. 

I worked at a tour company in their offices in Rome. Salaries/wages aren't very high in Italy, so I supplemented my monthly income with private tutoring lessons, which I created via an Italian professor at an American study abroad program. One Mother referred me to another and another etc and I soon had 10 students.

It's totally possible and totally worth it, just have faith in yourself and just go for it!

I'll speak for myself even though pretty much everybody is like this:

I guess I do. I mean, it's like a safeguard, so that I can always go back on my answer/question and to never push the other person into an uncomfortable situation.

But yes, if you ask me something to which I want to say no, I'll go with ""perhaps"", I'll dodge the issue, I'll delay it to an uncertain future, I'll say ""that could be interesting if x and y also happened"" - I may say a lot but I won't say ""no"".

For example, arranging a date can be quite an hassle, I don't want to push the other person into saying ""no"" or going with me against her own will, and I also don't want to face rejection - I first have to ask if we she's free next week, then I tell her that I was planning on doing something, then I ask her if she'd be interested in joining me and this takes a while, if on any of these steps she doesn't seem convinced then I immediately fall back and suggest if something else would sound better and this goes on and on till a consensus is achieved even though during the whole time I didn't ask her out and she didn't say no, all the questions were around the issue but nothing like ""want to go out with me?"" and all her answers were open to interpretation and never ""yes, I want to go out with you"" or ""no"".

true,AnimalFarmPig,null,null,"I really like the custom of refusing favors and offers. It allows both parties to be polite and friendly to one another. I've seen this in a few places, and it exists to some extent in southern USA culture (where I grew up).

Three times sounds about right to me. Anything beyond that would be excessive. I'm guessing ""3 times"" isn't a codified rule of etiquette in Ireland, but just a matter of common courtesy.

For the [reductio ad absurdum](http://isthistaarof.blogspot.com/2011/12/nazanin-rafsanjani-explains-taarof-on.html) version of this, there is the Persian tradition of [tarof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taarof)--

&gt; T'aarof also governs the rules of hospitality: a host is obliged to offer anything a guest might want, and a guest is equally obliged to refuse it. This ritual may repeat itself several times before the host and guest finally determine whether the host's offer and the guest's refusal are real or simply polite. It is possible to ask someone not to t'aarof (""t'aarof nakonid""), but that raises new difficulties, since the request itself might be a devious type of t'aarof.

It's perhaps excessive, but the spirit seems right to me.

However, the problem comes here:

&gt; At times t'aarof can lead to one performing a task that one does not want to perform. For instance, if one friend offers a ride to another friend only because they are being polite, they may become stuck in the situation if the friend agrees to get the ride. Of course if one was going by the rules of t'aarof, one would refuse the offer many times before accepting.

I doubt that this is an issue when communicating / offering favors within one's own culture, but when there is someone from outside the culture who doesn't understand the concept involved, problems can occur. I have friends from scandinavian countries who love how people in [whatever country] will offer everything, and how happy they are for the hospitality, and I cringe because I know that they don't understand the concept.",0,1357599305,null,0,false,0,c7sul0o,t3_164btg,t1_c7sul0o,t1_c7sqjzo,null,1430888445,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

This is as ridiculous as saying Christianity brings no positives to the table. While both of these religions have morals millennia outdated, they do both have a message of good will at heart.  

&gt;Shitting on islam =/= shitting on brown people.

I'm going to try and explain why so many people conflate these two things.

Surely you can see the connection... shitting on Islam -&gt; shitting on Muslims -&gt; shitting on brown people. 

This is the same type of person that used to shit on brown people because of a perception that they were foreign, thought differently, acted differently, would have a negative effect on our society. 

Now that is widely unacceptable, but when you shit on Islam you can say ""this is a belief, they DO think differently, they DO act differently, they DO have a negative effect on our society"". And we can look at Islamic countries and we see that they are worse off, and we can make the connection to Islam.

But it is the same fear of the foreign and the unknown at heart. People are just people. 

**In my experience racists tend not to have a problem with the fact that a brown person is brown, and they often don't even think that they are biologically flawed somehow.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;Peter Bofinger, economist at Würzburg University and one of the German government’s economic advisers, believes that while reforms in southern European countries are inevitable, Germany, Europe’s most powerful economy, needs to do more to help. In fact, **it needs to make itself less competitive.**

&gt;“We need wage increases of five percent and more this year,” he says. “We need higher pensions and higher welfare pay-outs. Only if Germany gets more expensive, if it loses competitiveness relative to the other eurozone members, we can fix this fundamental flaw in the construction of the eurozone.”

Please don't listen to this fool. What Germany needs is to continue being very competitive.

What a ridiculous claim, that Germany should act against its self-interest to reduce the divide. If anything, Germany should do what they can to bring the rest of Europe to its level and countries like mine should do like Germany did to become as competitive as (or even more competitive than) the Germans!

&gt;In Portugal, homeland to EU Commission President Barroso, President Anibal Cavaco Silva used his New Year’s speech to condemn the bailout terms dictated by EU and International Monetary Fund (IMF) as “social injustice” which led to a “vicious circle of economic decline and a reduction of tax revenue.”

Aníbal Cavaco Silva is the President, not the PM, he has no power, let him talk as nobody takes him seriously any more. He's also from the same political party as our current PM and from Barroso himself, so it's not like he'd act too much against their interest. Last but not least, he's also to blame for our situation as he was PM from 85 till 95 and even with the accession of Portugal to the EU and all the money that started pouring in from Brussels, the debt to GDP ratio increased during his years.

&gt;But the real worry, according to German economist Lars Feld of Freiburg University, is France.
&gt;“They haven’t done anything to increase their competitiveness,” says Mr. Feld, “yet is the country that works the least among eurozone members each year.”

&gt;German officials in the past few months did not hide their disappointment in what they perceive as an ineffective response to the crisis by President Hollande. With negative growth predicted for most of Europe in 2013, it would be a major blow if the eurozone’s second economy were to stumble.

This. I wouldn't worry too much about Portugal and Spain and the like as we're on the right path and the only way we can go is up, the reforms are taking place and once the debt goes down and there's a relief in taxes, the economy will be able to grow again. France, on the other hand, they're a serious issue, Sarkozy must have fucked up pretty bad for Hollande getting into power, don't let them fuck things up for the rest of Europe! Gosh, can you imagine the smugness of the Brits if the French fucked things up for us all?

I've always thought this subreddit as a model for others: mostly discussion about news, culture et cetera rather than pun threads and image captions. Then we have the occasional thread that is either directly or tangentially related to Islam, and everything changes. There are certainly racists within this community, as in every community, but there is also a valid concern about Islam in modern European society that must be  allowed to be discussed openly without devolving into insulting one another.

I won't claim to be an expert on Islam, Christianity, or religion in general, but it seems to me it is more likely for Muslims rather than Christians to believe in stricter interpretations of their religion. As such, one may become less willing to assimilate to a different culture, and may see those who are not of the same belief system, or unfamiliar with their beliefs as hostile. Being a devout Muslim in a European country is probably very difficult, given the fact that society is secular, and the majority of people are atheists, agnostics, Christians, or unaffiliated. Christianity was, at one point, very much like what Islam appears to be today. The difference is that Europe entered a new era, facilitated by the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, and two world wars. The most common form of Christianity that exists today is compatible with European and Western society because it was gradually subdued over the past two thousand years. There are many Muslims that successfully integrate and assimilate into the cultures of the countries they move to, but there are many that do not. That is something to be worried about because it threatens to dilute cultures and damage social and political nuances that have been built up over thousands of years. Many posters here often talk about how further European integration represents a similar threat.

true,Aluhut,null,null,"&gt; Die Israelis sind am Antisemitismus also wieder einmal selbst schuld

Warum bist du der Frage die in dem Absatz steht ausgewichen?

Ich rede btw noch immer nicht von Antisemitismus sondern Israelkritik. Natürlich sind die Israelis an der Kritik schuld. Wäre das Thema Polenkritik, wäre auch Polen daran schuld. Das umdrehen meiner Worte bringt uns da nicht wirklich weiter. 

&gt; Israel ist für Dich der Gefahrenherd im Nahen Osten, obwohl das Land seit Jahrzehnten im Besitz von Atomwaffen ist und in mehrere konventionelle Kriege verwickelt war, ohne diese einzusetzen oder auch nur ihren Einsatz anzudrohen, überdies stets bereit war, Friedensverträge zu akzeptablen Konditionen zu schließen. 

Ach so. Also weil Israel neben Pakistan und Nordkorea sich nicht an den Atomwaffensperrvertrag halten muss und ja jeder schon weiß, dass sie welche haben, ist es gut? Ist so super, dass es schon Antisemitismus ist wenn ich es kritisiere? 

Ich muss mich jetzt wegen meiner Kritik an Atomwaffen in einem Kriesenherd um die Ecke rechtfertigen. Weil es Israel ist. Meinst du im ernst ich müsste mich für meine Kritik an Iranischen Atomwaffen rechtfertigen wenn das das Thema wäre?

In dem Zusammenhang ist natürlich auch das Thema Sicherheitsrat und Israel unter deinen Tisch gefallen. Welch Überraschung.

Du lieferst mit jedem Beitrag noch mehr Gründe warum mein erster Beitrag vollkommen richtig war. 

&gt; Möllemanns Versuch, mit Stimmungsmache gegen Israel Wähler zu gewinnen, war dann wohl auch nur meine Einbildung. Die periodisch vorkommenden Verwüstungen jüdischer Friedhöfe sind Bagatelldelikte und werden schon gar nicht mehr wahrgenommen. Gleiches gilt für Brandanschläge auf Synagogen. Und ""Jude"" ist auf Schulhöfen kein Schimpfwort, sondern ein Ausdruck von Anerkennung.

Wow jetzt hast du es mir aber gegeben. Das ist natürlich nichts gegen die übliche Ausländerfeindlichkeit, brennende Asylbewerberheime und ""Schwuchtel"" auf dem Schulhof. Soll das ein Witz sein? Jedes Kind welches eine Brille trägt kommt in die Gefahr in der gleichen Art und Weise beschimpft zu werden. Es heißt nicht deswegen, dass jedes (arabische) Kind welches ""Jude"" sagt automatisch Juden verfolgt o.ä.

Übertreibungen bringen es nicht. Funktioniert schon nicht bei der Islamophobie. Wird auch hier nicht funktionieren.

&gt; Du sprichst hier also offen aus, dass Du bei der Urteilsbildung von vornherein gar keinen Anspruch auf Ausgewogenheit, Differenziertheit und Fairness mehr hast. 

Ich spreche hier vor allem offen aus, dass es neben dieses angeblichen Antisemitismusproblems auf jeden Fall auch ein Problem gibt mit selbsternannten AntiAntisemiten zu geben scheint. Leute die wie du am liebsten so lange drehen und wenden bis das Gegenüber auf jeden Fall wie der KaPo von neben an wirkt. 

Ich wiederhole es nochmal langsam: Es geht hier um Israelkritik vs. Antisemitismus. Nicht um Israelpropaganda vs. Israelphilie. Ist jetzt schon das gesamte Thema nicht zulässig für dich? Darf ich das nicht mehr? Muss ich jetzt jedes mal einen Absatz der die Errungenschaften dieses Landes hochleben lässt?

This is rather silly.

If the UK or any other one of the Commonwealth realms were turned into a republic, the Queen would *of course* not get any of the Crown's property back any more than Edward VIII got when he abdicated or George VI when India became a republic (or Elizabeth II herself when Kenya became a republic).  I'm sure some other legal fiction would be found to explain why the property of the Crown would become that of the state, but there's absolutely no doubt that it would happen.

Who are they? I don't believe Merkel goes to bed laughing, neither does Hollande, nor the Greek prime minister, or most people who owns a business, rich or not.Do you have names?

The politicians of the 90's and 80's who created the Euro knew the faults, of course, but they choose to ignore it because of the vision they had. I don't think Kohl, Chiraq and the others acted out of true spite, they had a vision, sure, with power and grandeur for themselves, but also for Europe.

I remember the Swedish vote of 2003 (when we voted no). The faults of the Euro was clearly stated, and discussed. Now, you can believe that Swedes are a superhuman race that had this information, as the only persons in the world, *or*, it could just be said that other countries, when they decided to join the Euro, had the same information, but decided not to act upon it - because it was all going to be so good. (and, btw, I think Sweden more voted no out of suspicion towards the EU than a superb financial sense).

If it was a conspiracy, it is a rather big one, because despite the fact that the information of how imperfect the Euro was and the trouble it would cause eventually, most countries honestly didn't care, they just joined in like there was no tomorrow. Not everyone though, not the UK, not Denmark or Sweden for example. 

So, it would be nice to blame ""them"", but unless you mean every person who was alive and able to vote in the 90's, I think everyone has to take their blame - it is not a grand conspiracy, it is worse.

It is oversight, ignoring, not caring, thinking it will not happen to me, it is for a good cause, they have been wrong before, what could happen, and a million more reasons rolled into one.",0,1357639417,null,0,false,0,c7t5hdr,t3_164rrd,t1_c7t5hdr,t1_c7t4zp2,null,1430893712,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Lots of undercover journalism has been made public and even officials recognize it. It is like that in many western countries. 

I don't agree with your arguments. In fact, I see the opposite. There is growing anti-western sentiment in these communities and these communities are more likely to act on it than the native european. Just the fact they are underprivileged, ghettoised and religiously mandated, makes them more likely.

The 'Flag Institute' says:

&gt;*Today all buildings (including government buildings) are encouraged to fly the Union Flag, where possible. This has removed the need formally to define designated flag flying days*

To have confronted her would have been tantamount to confronting the koran and hadith  itself as she probably used these memorised verses to justify her actions.

There are many which justify beatings, for such ""transgressions"" as forgetting prayers and memorising verses.  However they also indicate to not beat the person that it raises welts or bruises and to not hit the face or other sensitive areas.  
This makes it tricky to see when a child is being beaten regularly under these rules.

&gt; a brainwashed society

Or just a different culture you can't cope with?

&gt; No, I mean where are you REALLY from?

This is a very normal question to ask people - when I do it, I'm genuinely interested. I speak fluent English myself; I've lived in other countries where English is the main language, and I don't get all pissy when people ask me where I'm from because I don't look local.

Scandinavian countries are fairly homogenous physicaly speaking - you can clearly tell when somebody is of scandinavian descent or not(well, most cases, anyway). You can't do that to such an extent in many other regions.

I don't get why you're so butthurt - clearly the place isn't for you and you've grown some sort of hatred towards the region.

true,mister_meerkat,null,null,"Ah fair enough the situation isn't particularly simple and certainly not obvious.  To give a very quick recap of the last 400 years, the [Plantation of Ulster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation_of_Ulster) happened in the 1600's when land in what is know Northern Ireland was taken from land owners and given to colonists from Britain.  The native Irish were largely Catholic and the British settlers were largely Protestant.  Due to the fact the religion passes down the generations so nicely and that there has been very little marriages between the two cultures over the last 400 years (which hasn't been as bad since the end of ""the troubles"" in the late 1990's, but for example up until 1778 it was illegal for a catholic and a protestant to get married*), now a days you just have to look at what type of church you belong to to decide if you are of Irish or British decent, which in turns lets you know in which direction you should be throwing petrol bombs and/or bricks.  And so in this case it is the British/Loyalist/Protestant part of the country that is the primary driving force for the riots.

No doubt some people will argue my comment is biased as I used words like colonist to describe the people who took and settled on the land, but I consider this to be a reasonably accurate (although hugely simplified) version of events.  I will just point out that while I'm not at all a fan of colonising other peoples land, the idea of holding this against people of today for something their ancestors may or may not have done 400 years ago is insane.

Short answer, from foreigners: No good place to stay in city center. Either noisy, expensive/ rude. 


This one is relatively cheap and in the center; it's near a busy street so it may be noisy during the weekend.

That's the only one I ever slept in, since I now live here.

Just near a very nice place called ""place de la canourge"":

Keep in mind that none of them is very good.

I work at the university and we recommend this one if you ever happen to go working near the ""Hopitaux/Université"" quarter:

15 minutes to the city center. The place is otherwise not interesting if you want to visit the city.

If you are young and a bit adventurous, you should check the couchsurfing community, very active in this city, and the best way to meet local and stay in a great place. Bring something from your country to eat or drink and you're all good.

All of this is speculation. Interest aside, there are indirect profits for other European economies, given the bargains in privatization deals (many of them products of under the table discussions, which is extremely funny if you listen to some EU figureheads talking about anti-trust laws). Also, the ""bailout"" is an essential ingredient in the bank recapitalization salad, which has the result of allowing several pre-""bailout"" failed European banks to fund non-""PIIGS"" economies.

&gt; it's not just Germany who bailed out Greece, it was all of the EU and the IMF

If you actually read the loan facility agreements, you'd see that they were signed by Greece/Portugal/Ireland and other Eurozone members ([example](http://www.minfin.gr/content-api/f/binaryChannel/minfin/datastore/30/2d/05/302d058d2ca156bc35b0e268f9446a71c92782b9/application/pdf/sn_kyrwtikoimf_2010_06_04_A.pdf), page 3 of the pdf).

Spent a lot of time in Figuerolles (many Art Hotspots there, good reason for there to be so many Bobo's),  ""place Candolle"" was cool at night too, then again, I spent a lot of time all over the town.
Was very lucky for accommodation, lived in a studio at Louis Blanc one year, lived in a very nice T3 just off la Comedy another year. People hated me for living there with very cheap rent. Just under the roof tops ( Too hot in the summers to live there), a view on the polygone.
Everything on the doorstep, it was amazing! Walk-able distance to school (Bx-Arts).  
It was very hard to find places to live at the time and the rents in the city centre happened to usually be astronomical even back then unless you knew people. When in Montpellier I preferred to leave my car at my parents house the other side of the country, I didn't need it. Part of my studies included viewing all the exhibition openings. You get to meet loads of characters. 
Odd studies, very hard and very fun at the same time. On the night scene you are hated by other students, (free access to all of the French museums, cheap entrances to all the cultural gigs, ...) 
It is mainly Art Students that get labelled as being BOBO, Bourgeois Bohème. We did have a very bohemian life style, but as students we where not eastern European Gipsy's,we were not really poor struggling for shelter or food. 
One day I was doing a painting on the Place de la comedy (a performance), had fun when M6 turned up and started filming me. I continued painting but wrote in big letters across the middle of the painting something in the lines of ""F*ing Camera is pissing me off!"".
Never seen a camera pan away so quickly!
I miss the school, it is a great school, supposed to be very hard to get into one. Once in, you get to know what real fear is, what real feelings are. It was studies that nurture all possible feelings to help better express them in pictures, performances, film...

You mean who *are* Irish, no doubt, because the Northern Irish have been British for centuries.

They're all ethnically Korean of course, just as both you and (I kind of suspect I, not totally sure tbh) are ethnically celtic. But that's it.

From where does this birthright stem?

Consider that I, as a middle-class person, can go anywhere in the world I like to get the best education that suits my interests. I can then travel to, live and work in the country that has the most lucrative jobs for my chosen profession. I have no loyalty to any country, my only loyalty is to my family and my employer. Increasingly, countries are becoming irrelevant to me.

However, in each country, on whom do I depend? The existing proletariat who perform the menial tasks to keep that country going. For them (especially in the EU) there are many programmes to give them some of the same advantages that I enjoy but they have an idea (or, even ideal) of 'home' and 'country' that dissuades them from even considering the possibility of leaving. Many of my friends (who are unemployed or on low-wage jobs) have this peculiar trait - they genuinely would not leave the country for a better quality of life elsewhere.

As far as I am concerned, we desperately need to get rid of this loyalty to any one country. As we can see from the mobility of the rich, a country will bend over backwards to accommodate them. The only way to maintain a balanced country that serves all of its people is to ensure complete and total free movement of labour, so that each country must compete on an open market to attract all of its labour, not just rely on the complacency of those that give it unconditional loyalty.

No, they don't.

&gt;If there is austerity the government no longer buys things and services from private companies.

Which is a good thing, it stops public debt from growing and allows for a reduction in taxes.

&gt;people get fired from those private companies (lack of demand for their products) 

Or they sell their product to someone else. For example, [this is what Romania exports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Romania_Export_Treemap.png). You think it's the government the ones who buy that shit?

Oh, and for the government to buy something, they need first to get the taxes for it. They don't actually produce anything, they only redistribute from the people who worked in the first place to the people who are now doing jobs for the state and that could be employed elsewhere hadn't the state paid them to work for them.

&gt;For every euro that the state cuts in spending, another 5€ (it may be as low as 3€ or as high as 7€, depending on the economy) is lost from the GDP of the country.

Jesus fuck, and for every 1€ the state spends, another 5€ or 3€ or 7€ is lost from the GDP of the country because that euro had to come from the taxpayers.

Are you really this stupid? You think there are free lunches? That the state can just spend money it doesn't have? That all spending is good, the state should just spend 1.000.000.000.000€ and we'd all be insanely rich just like that?

&gt;And the problems is not just that decrease in GDP (that is very obvious in Greece) or that private companies go bankrupt due to lack of ~~demand~~ **purchasing power** from customers. It's that it's a vicious cycle: after a couple of years of ~~austerity~~ **excessive taxes**, the economic climate will become so bad that the government needs more ~~austerity~~ **taxes**, leading to an even worse economic climate.

Intentional degradation of language by the increase of ad-hoc single-application rules for the purpose of keeping an individual group happy at the expense of broadening a definition unnecessarily.

&gt;I hear this neoliberal ""because Southern European are lazy, while the Northern Europeans are hard-working""

Who said that? I want to laugh at him as well xD

More like because some countries let the free market work on its own and just tax what they need to make the state work as well (like mostly everyone did) and because some other countries tried to send what they didn't have and spent money without levying enough taxes to cover for it and now aren't being able to either cut the spending or raise the taxes required to face the debt problem and are facing these problems as a result (like a few countries in South did).

That's all there is to it, on the one hand you have balanced budgets and deficits under control and on the other you have unbalanced budgets and public debt getting out of control, the consequences of these two situations now having their consequences.

&gt;I'm not saying that Nordic people are not hard-working, just that they don't work more than the Southerners.

What are you talking about? Who's saying x or y are z or w?

On, and with regard to hard work, what matters is productivity, not time on the job.

&gt;In Nordic countries, you're paid 8 hours, you work 8 hours. But in some parts of Southern Europe, it's expected for you to stay late at work, to do unpaid overtime.

Yeah, I'd suggest that people who work overtime and aren't paid to renegotiate their contracts. It might not be the wisest time to do it now with the unemployment as it currently is but the unemployment is itself a consequence of the business conditions here which are driving away employment.

Und da es auf Demonstrationen durchaus üblich ist, daß die Polizei vermummende Helme trägt, find ich das nur logisch, daß man andere Identifizierungsmethoden braucht.

Eine Nummer ist auch sehr viel eindeutiger als eine Beschreibung ala ""Mitte 30, hellbraune Haare, sportlich"".

Und wenn ein potentielles Opfer eine Nummer nennt, die bei dem Einsatz gar nicht vergeben war oder dessen Träger zum Tatzeitpunkt nachweislich gar nicht in der Nähe war, kann man auch Querulanten besser vermeiden und bestrafen.

&gt; ""Wurde mir im Gerangel abgerissen""

Ganz einfach, die Nummern werden auf Westen gedruckt/gemalt/eingebrannt/geschweißt, die man über die restliche Einsatzkleidung trägt. Reißfeste Stoffe sind kein Hexenwerk. Und wer seine Weste trotzdem verliert, muß sich aus dem Einsatzgeschehen zurückziehen.

Oder man könnte die Nummer auch rundrum auf den Helm drucken. Da guckt man sowieso instinktiv hin und kann sich die Nummer dann auch besser merken.

Daß es unmöglich ist, Daten mißbrauchssicher zu verwalten, ist ganz einfach falsch. In der Privatwirtschaft wird das in so gut wie allen Branchen gemacht, wenn's wirklich wichtig ist. Datenlecks treten immer dann auf, wenn Benutzerfreundlichkeit eine große Rolle spielt oder der Datenverwalter kein besonderes Interesse daran hat oder zu inkompetent ist, die Daten zu schützen.

The restriction of flying the union flag was the latest in a long line of attacks on unionist/loyalist culture. It was the touch paper but tensions have been simmering for a long time. Loyalists feel that their culture, heritage, rights to parade are under sustained attack and that republicans have done much better out of the peace process. The investigations into the past have also focused on the security forces and loyalists whilst the IRA and Sinn Fein (who murdered over 2000 people) refuse to engage with enquiries. Working class loyalist communities are becoming progressively more impoverished with increasing social problems whilst republican areas have been less badly affected. This is partly because of the deep segregation (e.g. Catholics and Protestants attend different schools) which leads to a two teir education system with much better outcomes for Catholics/nationalists/republicans. 

The area in which most of the trouble is focused is a waste land compared to 20 years ago. Many of the houses and businesses have gone, and of those that are left many houses now have steel grills over their windows for protection against sustained attack.

That video is quite old and though I find it amusing, it's also not accurate. Keynes never was the ""let's spend what we don't have"" as many now would want you to believe, the spending he did support was for public goods that were greatly needed during the Great Depression, he didn't have that many disagreements with Hayek when it came to fiscal policy. With regards to Hayek, to not even mention his views on monetary policy, yeah, way to over-examine the details and ignore the elephant in the room.

&gt;you also don't seem to grasp de idea of a loan. 99.999% of all business ventures ever were made with people spending money they didn't have.

We're in debt because we loaned too much and the investments didn't pay off. You're suggesting we to get even more loans as opposed to reducing the overall spending of government?

&gt;You should read [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/02/opinion/krugman-nobody-understands-debt.html?_r=0)

We have a debt over 100% of our GDP, and Portugal isn't the USA, most of our debt isn't owed to ourselves, we don't have our own monetary policy, and our economy growing (unlike our debt).

This on its own is more than enough reason to not get into more debt, but even if this wasn't true, why should we increase public spending? We have plenty of public goods - infrastructure, education, NHS, you name it!

Pour en finir avec les idées reçues de tous bords, voici quelques infos :

1. Avant 1973, on empruntait déjà au privé (emprunt Pinay de 1958).
2. Après 1973, on empruntait encore à la BDF à taux très faible (jusqu'à 10 milliards de francs).
3. D'autres pays (Etats-Unis par exemple), ont recours à la création monétaire, mais ils ne vont pas mieux.
4. Aujourd'hui, l'Etat peut encore emprunter à des taux très faibles, et on a même vu récemment des taux négatifs !

Il n'y a pas de cause unique ni de solution unique à un problème complexe. La planche à billet est une possibilité parmi d'autres, mais elle a des effets extrêmement pervers, c'est pourquoi un grand nombre de pays ont choisi de limiter le recours à la création monétaire directe par les États, en lui préférant la création indirecte par l'octroi de prêts bancaires.

You're right, but to come to the conclusion that ""people don't have money to spend so the state should spend for them"" is, to put it lightly, odd.

What the state needs to do in that situation is to liberalise the market, lower taxes and pursue other policies that allow the economy to grow with less restrictions. Not to get into debt, spend in name of the families and then get stuck paying interest till it can levy the taxes required to pay off the debt.

The anger seems to be a refusal to accept that things ***are*** equal nowadays. The compromise of flying the flag on certain days of the year only is just that, a compromise. Northern Ireland is not England, it is a special case with special circumstances in which both sides, Nationalists and Unionists need to be accounted for. Loyalists wanted it up all year round, Nationalists wanted it down entirely and democratically it was resolved to have it up some of the time, at which point Loyalists protested/rioted/threw the toys out of the pram. Do you not find anything ridiculous about that?

Like the absolutely insane and indefensible logic that people who have committed no crimes whatsoever should have their freedom of religion, assembly and expression limited because people with the same faith are over-represented in prison.

Or the concept of ""integration"", which effectively gives governments the power to determine which values and opinions the people are allowed to have. Insanity.

I believe that the people who don't belong in Europe are the ones that want a society that collectively punishes the population and limits freedom of opinion. Not ""Muslims"", ""Foreigners"" or ""Immigrants"" in general.

Like [this](http://i.imgur.com/0cMSi.jpg)? Not even close. Take a look at Monaco on [Google Maps](http://goo.gl/maps/3D7lu), that place is tiny, use street view if you want to see how the place actually is. I can tell you right now it's not like anything you'll find in the US.

But then again, very few houses in Europe are, we build our houses not out of wood but out of concrete :P

&gt;How does public housing work in Monaco?

I highly doubt it. The place is as exclusive as Fisher Island.
