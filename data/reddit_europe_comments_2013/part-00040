No politicians are going to put their asses on the line for those 3 countries because the public would burn them.

Everyone's minds here go stupid when it comes to national debt and since frankly that kind of deal is not going to get done without us it's a nonstarter.

true,Semirhage,null,null,"I did a PTSI-&gt;PT in a middle rank school in Lyon. I'm just going to comment in random order. Most of this only applies to scientific studies.

PTSI is the easiest scientific prepa with the highest percentage of students successfully admitted to schools. However if you are more ambitious or don't like industrial science (which is an amalgam of a bunch of somewhat random stuff: mechanics, materials, mechanics of materials, machine/system design, basic electronics, fabrication etc), you should pick something else (like PCSI-&gt;PSI).

It wasn't military school (there was no curfew, technically the school gates closed at midnight or something but they were magnetic so we just kicked them open. Other schools are much harder to get into if the gates are closed), but in my two years there I barely visited the city I was in. I would have exams on Saturdays and everything is closed on Sundays anyway. Weekends were sometimes lonely because lots of people go home for the weekend.

It's an excellent environment to learn how to work, but it's not an environment to ""blossom academically"" if you will. You won't have time to be curious about other things, the subjects you are studying is all you thinking about.

Students are given a lot of attention, yes, but not really the nice and good kind. They just don't you to fail. Pressure is their main tool of motivation.

Yes financially there's nothing better (although university would give you enough free time to work part time). Free tuition and cheap dorm room. At my school, 3 meals a day for the year was around 1450 euro, and 3 meals a day + shared bedroom including electricity/heating/water was just 200 euro more (yes, I'm serious). The only expenses you have are holidays, weekend meals and buying paper for notes.

After any science prepa if you qualify for the oral exams of any engineering schools, you can go to university for the 3rd year of physics or mechanics or whatever your specialty is (MPSI-&gt; math, etc). If you want to stop after 1 year and you're not doing too bad, you can go directly into 2 year of bachelors. A friend of mine actually did 2 years of prepa then bachelors of physics to do astronomy. She didn't want to do the first year of bachelor in physics in a university.

Didn't go to a normal high school (was abroad) so it was different for me. But I don't think I matured much in those 2 years. I learned of things, including how to deal with pressure and how to not be afraid to speak even if you don't know shit, and stuff like that, but it's like my personal growth stagnated, which sucks.

Soul sucking? yes, it certainly felt that way on weekends, when I had time to think. For the first half of the first year, I felt sick before every colle (1 hour oral exam, twice per week) and at lunch I would eat extremely fast because I was anxious all the time. Teachers put so much pressure on you to work.

Right now I'm in university. It's a long story, I got the school I wanted, but I ended up hating it and what I was studying, so I went to university for the 3rd year of bachelor in physics and now I'm actually in a master program with 3 institutions, 2 of which are engineering schools. Going to university was actually really scary for me, having never lived in France until prepa and engineering school I had only heard bad stuff about it but my experience so far has been positive. The big thing that university lacks is activity clubs. It's hard to meet people who have the same interests. But at least you have time to meet people.

Do I regret going to prepa? dunno. Sometimes it didn't feel all that bad and I was doing ok without working too much, and sometimes I felt like I couldn't breath. All that knowledge and method was useful, but I didn't feel like I was actually living. The only way I got through was because I did a lot of sports to take my mind off things. You have no time for socializing outside of your class or dorm. On the other hand if I'd gone straight to university, I might have given up because I was lazy, didn't have any friends and didn't know how to make friends whereas in prepa you make friends easily because you're all in it together.

If you have any questions about prepa, engineering school or university, go ahead because I've experienced all three. This post is long enough, so I'm going to look at your other replies here.

true,underground-man,null,null,"&gt;How does look the public transport? Is it reliable? How does look the transport in the NRW? 

The so called ""öffentlicher Nahverkehr"" (public transportation-System) in germany is very reliable yet expensive compared to other States. There are Buses, Tram-Trains and, in bigger Cities, Subway-Trains for the inner city parts  plus Regio-trains and Suburb trains for traveling between cities. Fortunatly you don't have to care so much for the prices of the named transportation-possibilities because your university is giving (or, lets say: you have to buy it) you a ""semesterticket"", a ticket which allows you to travel in a certain area without paying. According to the [website of your university](http://www3.uni-bonn.de/studium/bewerbung-und-einschreibung/vrs-semesterticket-nrw-ticket) your ticket will be valid for the whole state of Nordrhein-Westfalen. So you don't have to worry about traveling, at least not about traveling close distances. The density of train/tram and bus stations is usually quite well.

For longer distances there are very fast trains available (mostly the IC and ICE trains) which on the other hand are very expensive and NOT paid by your semesterticket.

I would for long distance always recommend taking the so called [""Mitfahrgelegenheit""](http://www.mitfahrgelegenheit.de/), something like a hitchhike-system except that it is organized over the internet and that you have to pay the driver (normally something between 4 and 6€ per 100km, depending on the driver).

&gt;What to do in Bonn/NRW? What should I see, what should I do?

A good start is to check Wikivoyage, Bonn has some good stuff [listed there](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Bonn). If your done with that, take a look at the other cities around Bonn, don't worry: There are plenty of them.

There are several ways I see this being addressed.

1. Use English, French, and German as the working languages of the armed forces, similar to how EU institutions run now.

2. Have sub-units based on language that report to higher authorities in a common language (English, most likely.)

3. Use English.

If you are not living on your own (i.e. with a host family), a lot of this will depend on the family. It might make a lot more sense for you to get in touch with them as early as possible and ask them about their habits etc. to get to know what their ""home life"" is like so you know what to expect. 

In terms of food: You will not find the same amount of variety that is common in the States. Korean and Mexican food is not really very common in Germany (in my experience at least), for example. But this depends a lot on the family again.

When I was 16, I was drunk every weekend and there were usually parties at people's places rather than going out to a club.

The city has changed a lot in the the past few years (in a positive way) and definitely has more pros than cons, and in my opinion would be worth the trip.

It's true that this can be a nerve racking environment. Without speaking of the academic advantage there are lifetime skills that you learn that  are invaluable such as :

* being able to work under pressure and managing difficult deadlines
* being able to learn really fast and efficiently
* being able to take criticisms
* focusing on doing things right
* being able to understand what you can and cannot do 
* understanding what is it to commit to something and to have the resilience to reach your goal
* being able to separate your professional life from your personal life and make time for both

I wont go so far as to tell you that is was an enjoyable experience but it was definitely a building experience and this is for sure a decision I don't regret making.

Some side notes: 

* It's true your leisure time will suffer; 
* You can and will alleviate some of the competitive nature of prepa by having a group of friend with whom you can study and do things outside. I found the experience really allowed me to bond with them (as when you bond with people sharing a traumatic experience). At the end of the two years it was as if we were a team training to compete in a event. It was really a good feeling.
* It is a nice setting if you are someone that you know will procrastinate, having teachers always on your back make it so you study a lot more. I know that if I went to a regular environment I wouldn't have gotten anything done.

What are some main differences between home life in the U.S. and Germany?

Like everything, depends hugely on your host family. In some, breakfast tradition is very important. Others do not have breakfast together. You'll figure it out, keep in mind that every host family is different and one does not represent all German families. 

What is drinking/party culture for 16 year olds?

It is highly developed. For clubs you should be 18 but you will definitely have some sweet parties with German beer and other stuff ;)

What is food like in Germany?

Depends again on the host family. I'd say tendentially more healthy and sustainable (awesome whole wheat breakfast). But you might also very well end up with a family that goes to McD every week. Although that's rather not likely. 


However, I hope you have a great time :) I strongly suggest to keep in touch with your host family. One never knows what lies in the future.

2nd EDIT: /r/europe has no sense of humor! Besides, this is an old Portuguese joke! Which I will tell of course... 

Here goes:

So, a Portuguese and a Spanish guy were walking down a beach, when one of them kicks a lamp. 

Suddenly, a genie sprouts out of the lamp and grants each of them a wish.

The Spanish goes first and says: 

*- I want a  strong wall built around my country, barring foreigners from entering. We're sick of Portuguese, Moroccans, French and all these other retards coming in and weakening our superior race.*

*- Great, now fill it to the top with water!* wished the Portuguese.

European military strength is completely based off the French and British but it is small and provincial.

UN peacekeepers are frequently useless. As the Guardian wrote, Pakistani, Indian etc. soldiers go to peacekeeping missions to get a pension, not to die there.

Also I believe Europe is somewhat responsible for the current state of several African countries and therefore it would be our task to restore or maintain order, prevent election frauds, protect young democracies etc. 



A stable Africa would be economically beneficial for EU companies too. I'm not talking about recolonisation of course. Although, at the moment the continent is on a good way to become a Chinese playground.

There's the lack of education: their tradition doesn't encourage studying and our schools aren't very welcoming to them, either: kids and teachers alike make fun of them. 

There's the lack of jobs: Romania (and Bulgaria, for that matter) have a shortage of jobs. In many places, you can't find even those jobs for minimum wage (160€) and if they hire someone, there's always the blatant discrimination against Roma people.

I remember a recent story in a newspaper about a bakery built using EU funds in a village: it hired only Roma people to work in it.

true,keepthepace,FRAN,France,"There are several points to consider here. NATO, the transition from a complete national army to a specialized one, and the structure of command.

Most European states are already part of a transnational army : NATO. Its supreme command is American, it is an alliance of several national armies. Each participating country, IIRC, accepts in advance to engage a certain amount of military means in any operation deemed necessary by the supreme command. In exchange, NATO ensures to defend any member with all its means in case of attacks.

Therefore, is it possible to make a EU army while still staying in the NATO? It imposes a few constraints : EU army won't be able to oppose NATO in any operation (but could choose to act in case NATO decides to stay neutral, and vice-versa). It also causes the problem that if a member participates both in a NATO operation and a EU operation, there may be a conflict of resources. If you have a single aircraft carrier, you will have to choose where to allocate it. This may be incompatible with NATO membership.

Why is it a big deal to leave NATO? Because small countries with little national armies currently rely on it to defend against mammoths like Russia. See what happened to Georgia for an example of what Estonia may fear. If it leaves NATO, it will need immediately a trustworthy alliance of a similar strength. 

And EU has shown to be far less reactive than US for instance on several issues. This is a structural problem : we have too many processes where consensus is necessary. Solidarity is also not EU's strong point, as the Greek crisis currently shows. If you can't be trusted to quickly help a country financially, why should you be trusted to help it militarily? Could Greece trust the EU to fight over Cyprus? Would the French or Spanish be concerned enough about Baltic states being attacked by Russia? The trust is simply not there for small countries to rely on EU yet.

Which leads to the last point : for a small country like Estonia, does it make sense to have a complete army? Air force, ground troups, navy, etc... If it is invaded, it won't be able to resist but still, it makes an invasion more costly than if there were no army. There were talks a few years ago, where NATO proposed that one of the Baltic countries specialized in demining operation (apparently they have good expertise in this field) and funds this sector more than others. In an alliance where you can rely on other armies, this is indeed cost effective, but you really need to trust the chain of commands there, to be able to send the tanks you need a few hours after enemy tanks are spotted. Not weeks, not days, but hours. It requires a high level of military cooperation.

Finally, US fears (rightly, I believe) that a EU army would weaken NATO. I think they will go to great length to prevent it from happening. They may even open the supreme command to non-US countries, which would be a big deal.

In the end, contrary to my pessimistic tone, I am in favor of a EU army, but I see no one in EU proposing a credible path to get there. I think that my country could have led the way for such a thing to happen when Sarkozy instead supidly joined back NATO.

Alone, we still have a functional and powerful army. If for instance we had gone to Mali with two or three other EU countries, it would have been possible to put into place a proto-EU command (everything in the EU seem to start from a 3-4 countries alliance, I think it is the way to go). If successful, it would have given arguments to leave NATO for these countries and reinforce cooperation, make a new defense alliance, a democratic structure of command and grow organically from there, partner after partner.

The political will seems to be absent. I am not in the knows of the military secrets, so it is quite possible that it makes more sense to rely on NATO for now, but as an europhile, I would love to see something as cementing as a EU army appear.",0,1362140133,null,0,false,0,c8nt3t6,t3_19f9as,t1_c8nt3t6,t3_19f9as,null,1431448409,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Corruption in Bulgaria or Italy, affects the whole EU (and in the case of Italy and Greece, it certainly affect the €).

I'm talking about a system where an independent agency with power to press charges can look out for the well being of euro citizens. They would probably consider a case of broken nose in Bulgaria as way too minor, but they might be very interested by the accusations of corruption and organized crime coming from the street protesters. 

Let's take human trafficking: if you want to dismantle an organization that operates in multiple countries, you need to talk to governments, coordinate with local law enforcement agencies (lot of red tape, lot of effort and money stupidly spent... risk that a corrupted official will notify the local mafia), hundreds of hours spent translating and synchronizing papers... to arrest a couple of dozens of guys.

Corruption and organized crime are european-wide problems (unless you believe in fairies, you must know that all member states face these problems), so I'd think that a EU-wide solution would be a really nice start.

I can't believe I'm doing this, but here's a slightly more serious response. The difference between Europe and the US/Canada is that we are a collection of countries. The differences between France/Germany vs. New York/Massachusetts doesn't need clarifying. As a result we have the EU, a bespoke solution to a bespoke probem.

L'articolo del Telegraph linkato titola:
&gt;The European Parliament is to spend almost £2 million on press monitoring and trawling Eurosceptic debates on the internet for ""trolls"" with whom to debate 

Chiunque conosca l'inglese capisce che i troll a cui si riferisce sono l'obiettivo della campagna anti disinformazione, non il mezzo per condurla. Lo scopo che si prefigge questa iniziativa infatti è scritto poco dopo:

&gt; Parliament's institutional communicators must have the ability to monitor public conversation and sentiment on the ground and in real time, to understand 'trending topics' and have the capacity to react quickly, in a **targeted and relevant manner**, to join in and influence the conversation, for example, by providing **facts and figures** to deconstructing myths.

Ovvero, le persone incaricate dovranno intervenire nelle discussioni in modo **rilevante e conciso**, riportando **fatti e numeri**. L'esatto opposto di trollare. Un oppositore all'idea è l'unico a parlare di ""troll istituzionali"" in senso provocatorio, e solo dopo aver definito il servizio un ""troll patrol"":

&gt; ""Spending over a million pounds for EU public servants to become Twitter trolls in office hours is wasteful and truly ridiculous,"" he said.

However if manual labor and manual laborers aren't appreciated the same way as other professionals, if they are for example looked down, then these kind of sayings make sense. But then again a society where people are looked down due to type of work they do doesn't make any sense.

Right .. they're not a fascist party. But it's mostly ex-fascists in them, from what I understand: after all, the party consists mostly of former politicians of the ex-fascist National Alliance. So they're no less and no more fascist than Fini's FLI. I.e. not very much.

&gt;The only fascist party in Italy is Casa Pound 

Not true - there's Forza Nuevo and Fiamma Tricolore too, but they all did badly and won about half a percent among them.

It's interesting, actually - throughout most of Italy's postwar history (up through 1992), the fascist MSI got 5-9% of the vote. Where did those people go? First to the Alleanza Nationale, of course, but that's gone too. To Berlusconi's party, I guess, or maybe now a bit to Beppe Grillo.

This is not to say that significant numbers of Roma don't belong to crime-ridden communities. Some become famous as leaders of organized crime. Some engage in horrible things like child trafficking rings. Many are pickpockets or street robbers. Watch 'The Wire'.

Many of the Roma were still nomads and they were settled in villages or cities as nomadism was banned.

Some of the Roma were however assimilated and merged within the general Romanian population. When a gypsy integrates in the society, almost always they no longer consider themselves Roma/gypsy.

Best beer in the world?  Go down to the Andechs Monastary by the Tegernsee.
Need Alps?  Short trip down to Garmish.
Museums?  The Deutches Museum is one of the best technology museums in the world.  Art?  The Alt or Neu Pinakotek (sp?)
City wandering?  Stroll through the pedestrian zone from the original Hofbrauhaus past the market and the old city hall on Marienplatz.  Drink a coffee at Dallmyers.  
Park warndering?  Stroll through the English Garden to the Chinese Pagoda and drink a beer in the beer garden (checking out the people sunbathing on the lawn and surfing in the current of the stream)
Looking for classic European castles and palaces?  The Residence downtown, Nymphenburg on the other side of town, Crazy Ludwig II's at Herrencheimsee a short train trip to the Chiemsee and a boat ride to the island, or a bus trip to Fussen to Neuschwanstein (the model for the Disney castle).
Ready for some sadness and reflection?  The Dachau concentration camp is right outside the city limits.
Cars?  We got your BMW experience world right across from the Olympic stadium and park.  Have a meal at the revolving restaurant at the top of the Olympic needle.
If your are itching to travel farther, Nurnberg, Salzburg, and Innsbruck are doable.
Cycling?  I don't know any specific routes, but the landscape around Munich is rolling hills until you reach the Alps.  Biking down South East of town toward Chiemsee should be great.  I've known folk who biked around Chiemsee, took the bikes over to the herrenchiemsee island and biked around that and loved it.

true,barsoap,SCHL,Sleswig-Holsteen,"I don't even know where to start. Every single region, sometimes down to village level, has its own dialect in Germany.

Standard German ultimately derives from Goethe, Schiller, and also Luther (the bible translation), and was used as stage language of nomadic theatres. Its grammar is mostly High German (high as in mountains), but pronunciation is very Low German, though with the High German consonant shift. Example:

HG ""Zeit"", LG ""Tiid"", ENG ""time"" -- t/ts  (also see ""tides"", etymologically that's just ""times"")  
HG ""Pfeffer, LG ""Peper, ENG ""pepper"" -- p/f

The practice served intelligibility, uniformity, style, and not to be laughed at for having an accent that the local population considers to be back-water.

Low and High German are actually different languages with their own dialects, with the caveat that neither of them has an army to back up that status. Dutch is, technically, a Low German dialect, though it's drifted a lot from the rest of Low German because they happen to have their own army. Frisian, OTOH, isn't, though it's a very related language, and together with Low German English's closest relative. Guess who spoke those languages? The Anglo-Saxons.

Overlaid over those different dialects of both Low and High German is Standard German, which is then transformed by the original dialects. Bavarians, for example, know about at least five different ""a""s, and Northerners don't like ""g""s in ablauts, it becomes a soft ""ch"" (hard ch being the ch in Loch Ness, not the one in church). When it comes to grammar, Bavarians say things like ""Franz his ball what he has shot through the window"", whereas around here we use constructs with multiple ""do""s (""tuen"") quite a lot, which isn't even proper Standard German and certainly not High German. ""Tu das tun"" -- ""Do do that"". As I said, it's English's closest relative (and we don't have that infamous German accent when speaking English, either). Proper Standard German would get rid of all the multiple-do constructs, and use ""machen"" (cf. ""make"") over ""tuen"" in ""Do that"".

Mutual intelligibility of the original (and still spoken) dialects is, once you get enough distance, near non-existent, mutual intelligibility between the different Standard German dialects is high, at least as long as people don't talk fast and sloppy.

Hannover is usually considered to speak the ""purest"" Standard German. It's, historically, a Low German speaking city. But the definition of Standard German isn't defined by Hannover, it's defined by the [Tagesschau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagesschau_%28Germany%29), and recently speakers there drift towards the Low German dialects with their treatment of ""er"". 

One real nice feature of all this is that if you teach kids whose native language is Standard German Low German, the original accent in Low German (mostly defined by how you pronounce the double-vowels/glides) comes to the surface, again. Even if the teacher speaks a completely different Low German dialect.

Oh, and then there's Danish, the already mentioned Frisian, in different versions from Denmark around the coast to the Netherlands, Sorbian on the border to Poland/Czechia (forming part of their dialect continuum), French in Saarland, and Romanes all over the place.

2. Less religion usually, especially in the northern states. By less religion, I mean virtually none outside of major holidays such as Christmas. And maybe Easter, but that's about it.
Less controlling parents, usually. Way less TV (German TV sucks balls).

3. You can buy/drink beer and wine. Getting your hands on liquor isn't that hard either and not entirely uncommon. Technically, you have to be off the streets at midnight (I think) if you're without a guardian and clubs won't let you in at all or only with a guardian that's 18+.
If there is no such thing, party culture generally centeres around hanging out at somebodies place/playground/campground/...

Recommendation: Know your limits. There are few things that piss off your hosts more than you throwing up all over the carpet because you went over the limit. Also, most german's at your age will have at least some experience with alcohol, so don't try to keep up with them.

Tip: Radler/Alsterwasser/whatever it's called there (Beer+Lemonade) is quite tasty, refreshing and not regarded as a proper alcoholic beverage. 

Remember that nobody at that age has access to a car, so unless somebody's got an older friend/silbling/awesome parent/available public transport, it's usually rather local (i.e. walking/biking distance). But it's not too uncommon to have a deal with parents like ""I'm picking you up at 1:30am"" or something. Again, don't throw up (in the car).

4. Breakfast: Muesli, cereal or bread with spreads. Common drinks are cold cocoa, coffee, tea (or infusions of all sorts) or fruit juices (mostly orange or apple).

Lunch: Mostly hot, it's the biggest meal of the day. All sorts of things, though Germans like to eat meat.

Dinner: Also called Abendbrot - i.e. Evening-Bread. It usually is a rather light meal. The standard would be bread, sausages/cold meat, cheese, maybe some veggies. Sometimes salad, soup or something of the like.
This however completely changes when the dinner is a social gathering. Then it can get quite big and elaborate.
Dinner is usually had as a family and on a dinner table without the TV running.

Bread: This one's important. German bread is amongst the best in the world and has nothing to do with most of the bread you get at the supermarket in the US. Proper german bread has a crust, usually isn't toasted and quite full of flavour on it's own. If you miss american-style bread, buy what German's call ""Toastbrot"".

Fast-Food: McD and BK are quite present, most cities of decent size have one or two of them, usually close to the train station. (large cities like berlin or munich obviously have more than that). Other than that, the only two other chains I can think of are PizzaHut and KFC, but they are pretty rare. The only major german chain I can think of is Nordsee (fish-centered). Most fast-food is small-business. Common things are the omnipresent Doener Kebap (kinda like a Yiros, just yummier), Bratwurst (with a roll or french fries, with or without curry-sauce) and the occasional asian take-away (I've never found a good and cheap curry place though). There is virtually no mexican food (and that which exists is usually served in cocktail bars to rather high prices).
Restaurants are also rarely chains and you'll see a lot of italian, some greek and obviously a lot of german.

Drinks: Standard is probably the Saftschorle, which is some sort of juice (O-Saft for orange juice, A-Saft for apple juice) mixed 1:1 with sparkling water. You cannot order tap water (I know, it sucks). If you order ""Mineralwasser"", it usually is sparkling (""Stilles (Mineral)wasser"" is non-sparkling). Soft drinks are often reserved for parties, special occasions or when going out to the movies/a restaurant/... though this is changing and depends on the family.

Portions: Smaller than in the US. It will be sufficient, but you will rarely have much leftovers.

Grillen: The equivalent to a barbequeue, though the meat is grilled directly over the coals/fire and not smoked. Usually steaks and sausages, served with bread (yay!) and salad. It is quite a common thing to do in the summer months. Have a Radler with that.


Another note: Public transport is one of the best in the world (I'd say only Japan rivals it) and most of the time, it even runs on schedule!
Decent sized cities (like Magdeburg) have a tram and extensive bus network (see [here](http://www.mvbnet.de/downloads/pdf/WEB_Magdeburg_LNP_Tag_ab161212.pdf) for the plan for magdeburg) that is better than everything I've seen in the US except for maybe San Francisco and New York City. There usually are also lines that run throughout the night.

Also, it's extremely easy to get around with a train, for example to go to Leipzig, just buy a rather affordable ticket for the Regionalverkehr and off you go. Trains are clean, safe, rather fast and run often. There are special tickets that allow you to take the local trains (ie. everything that's not IC or ICE) in the state for a whole day for something around 20 Euro (or 30 for 5 people).

For travelling larger distances and if you have more money than time, the ICE network is quite amazing and will get you pretty much anywhere.

Here is a map of some of the main dialects: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Danishdialectmap.png

Some of the dialects are almost, if not completely, incomprehensible to other Danes, especially if spoken by the older generation. The younger generation tends to have been heavily influenced through TV and radio and has drifted closer to 'rigsdansk' (Like standard English or Reichsdeutsch), but very distinct dialectal differences still remain. It's very easy to hear where someone comes from. 

A good example of how different the dialects are from rigsdansk is the sentence *'I think'*. In rigsdansk it's *'Jeg synes'* [jɑj synəs], while it's *'A tøvs'* [Ah tøvs] in several Jutlandic dialects. 

A fun fact is that there's a very distinct divide between East and West in where the definite article is placed. From Wikipedia about [this map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Denmark-gender.png):

&gt; West of the red line the definite article goes before the word as in English or German; east of the line it takes the form of a suffix.

In 'rigsdansk' the definite article takes the form of a suffix.

If you want to hear the difference, [here is a sketch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOnxD4GMJjs) where the presenter starts out talking rigsdansk, but ends up talking Southern Jutlandic with the guest (Also poking fun at the fact that Jutes really like their coffee and cookies).",0,1362155512,null,0,1362158359,0,c8nwgmh,t3_19gl96,t1_c8nwgmh,t3_19gl96,null,1431450007,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

I hope you can really can stay away from coal as the air quality in central-eastern Europe has been getting worse recently largely due to the rapid re-industrialization of Poland due to the economic growth there. There is a great hunger for energy, and there will be tremendous pressure to produce it from whatever sources are available. If you aren't careful closing nuclear may cause more environmental harm as it may push industry towards using more coal. See for example these article:

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-27/germany-to-add-most-coal-fired-plants-in-two-decades-iwr-says.html

&gt; Germany will this year start up more coal-fired power stations than at any time in the past 20 years as the country advances a plan to exit nuclear energy by 2022. 

http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/merkel-s-switch-to-renewables-rising-energy-prices-endanger-german-industry-a-816669-2.html

&gt; The operators of the major power grids have been in a state of alarm for weeks. Operator TenneT has had to draw on reserve capacity. Nevertheless, there have already been some serious problems caused by split-second power outages, which ordinary consumers don't even notice, but that create difficulties for industry, with its highly complex production processes.

I agree with your point about energy independence from Russia, and I think nuclear energy would help in that regard. It is important to realize, though, uranium which is the main fuel for the current generation of nuclear reactors is also a finite resource, and France's scramble to intervene in subsaharan Africa, and Mali in particular, to ensure that the supply of uranium to its nuclear industry are a good illustration of that. But there are promising new developments in thorium as an alternative fuel for examples, and that material occurs abundantly in Norway and Turkey - countries with which the EU has a free trade agreement. We need to be investing more heavily in nuclear research, and I think environmentalist can contribute significantly here by helping make the next generation of nuclear power plants even more safe.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Most of the polish trade goes to and from eurozone,

Like Sweden, DK and the UK. We are doing fine, thank you.

&gt; Prices and salaries will grow no matter if Poland has euro or not, so if there is no competitiveness rise the perspective is not good in each of choices. 

You are 100 % sure that it will rise to the degree that they will in the Eurozone? In the same time? You are also 100 % sure that the absolute best interest rate for Poland is the German one? You do know, if you have that, you have to compete with them. Are you 100 % sure you are competitive with the Germans? You are a lot more industrial then than the Spanish/Irish etc. Why and how? 


Also, I guess you are fine with permanent transfers to the south, because that is what is happening right now, and probably will for the next 30 years, minimum. How does Poland feel about that? 

Compare it when DDR/BRD became one country and one currency. Beside the fact that the Germans have pumped in trillions, East Germany didn't have to deal with foreign debt and West Germany covered the minimum social expenditure, like unemployment benefits, they are *still* not as competitive, more than 22 years afterwards. And that is for a much more optimal currency union (all currencies can be seen as currency union and they are never perfect, but more or less so. For example, the ultimate interest rate for Liverpool might not be the perfect interest for Bristol. However, the pound is, when all is said and done, a good working currency union). 

And, the Eurozone are doing so much less to even out the differences than Germany ever did, so good luck if you ever get into a slump. How are you planning to deal with that then ? 



&gt;For now Poland's economy is heavily connected with situation in Germany, if they are ok there will be lots of orders for Polish companies and this situation should stay like that in the nearest years. Unless Polish zloty suddenly gains in value...

So Sweden's, UK's and Denmark, and we are doing fine. Above all, I do think (no slight on the Poles) that we are more in line with the German competitiveness, due to our industry and that we've had high costs for a long time. So, it would be easier for us, and less of a loss, than for the Poles. Yet, we are doing better. You do know it is Economics 101 that your prices will rise, your costs/salaries will rise, and the competitiveness that you have had through that will disappear. What is Polands plans to avoid that? How have your government said that it will tackle it (it *will* happen, it is basic theory)? What are they going to do that the Spanish/Irish/Portuguese/Greeks haven't tried. I would love to hear the plan for that.

It requires Europe to be one nation one demos one sovereignty that's not happening certainly not in any of our lifetimes and the UK will never be a part of it.

What we could have and would give us almost all of the benefits is something like NATO but even a little deeper it can also sidestep the problem of free loading neutrals :P

We set up a new supranational alliance of EU member states can be an EU institution with the parliament acting as democratic oversight. Possibly have the scope to include EEA members case by case, norway and Iceland could join.
Existing members that are neutrals could have some sort of opt out Sweden and Ireland are small enough that it's not a problem and to be fair it wasn't part of the deal when they joined provision for Switzerland to get that opt out too if the ever join EU but no going back once your in.

Total obligation to protect other member states, all of them even overseas holdings so that needs fleshing out UK and France have most of these but would be the biggest contributors so it evens out somewhat.

This does have complicated implications for UK and Frances nukes would they be willing to go nuclear over somewhere on the southern periphery, it might be fine because any one attacking would have to be 100% that both UK and France would let them get away with it.

From there we set up a common defence market, research and procurement and standardise our command structures. This way we get a massive cost saving, better technology and total interoperability. 

The result is an impregnable Europe an attack on one is an attack on all but at the same time that power can't be thrown around on a whim abroad.
Outside of Europe a state can veto the use of it's assets or conversely go it alone so long as it doesn't violate international law. just a theoretical example someone attacks cape Verde, Portugal would want to help and not wait for everyone to decide, same with say UK and say Nepal (not that attacking there would end well). 

I can't really think of likely examples where only one country would want to intervene but there are many where some one not want to be dragged into something, but due to the interoperability it's no longer required that UK or France lead the way.

So the recipe has failed, not a single target has been achieved and the solution according to the government is more cuts and more austerity on a already deep depressed economy that even the President said in his new year speech (the President it from the government party btw) was in a recessive spiral and the course need to change.

I live in the traditional area of Poitevin-Saintongeais, but I have never heard this language, and I have never even heard of someone able to speak it. Some languages are in a better state, though (Breton, Basque, Occitan…), but they're still endangered. In some regions there are bilingual road signs (I've already seen signs in Breton or Catalan). I guess the average Frenchman considers regional languages useless or belonging to the past, and many would think regional languages close to French (like Picard) are French butchered by backward peasants. (I hope I'm exaggerating.)

Accents can be varied depending on regions. People from Toulouse and Provence don't speak like Parisians (nasal vowels are less nasal, they pronounce final E's that are silent in Standard French).

Austrian German is very similar to the Bavarian dialect, which means people from Northern Germany may have trouble understanding it.

Within Austria, the regions of Tyrol, Carinthia, Salzburg, Styria, Upper and Lower Austria and Burgenland do all have their own dialects but it's only minor differences in pronounciations and maybe use of some regional words that wouldn't be used very much elsewhere. So you can tell by the dialect where the person you're talking with is from, but you won't have any problem communicating :)

Vienna has its own distinct dialect that many people in the rest of Austria dislike. Maybe because they associate it with the attitude many people from Vienna have, that the rest of Austria is irrelevant and only consists of farmers and - for lack of a better word - hillbillies. No one from Austria will have problems understanding the Viennese dialect though.


It also seems that especially younger people in Vienna are losing the typical Viennese dialect and speak proper German (Hochdeutsch - High German) with a Viennese accent. Basically what Germans sound like when they imitate someone from Vienna.

The region of Vorarlberg is the only one that has a dialect different enough that people from the rest of Austria have trouble understanding it. It's much closer related to Swiss-German and seriously sometimes sounds like a different language.

For the Germans among you, it even has its own Wikipedia entry:

Einmal im Jahre 2013 gab es ein sehr guter Mann und eine schöne Frau. Sie wollten seit fünf Jahren ein Kind aber waren unfähig! Endlich waren sie erfolgreich und neun Monate später sind sie ganz schnell zum Krankenhaus gefahren.

Nach zwölf Stunden wurde das Kind (eine schöne Tochter, die Emily hieß) geboren! Aber kurz nach dem Geburt hörten die Eltern eine Krankenschwester draußen, die sagte:
“Sie hat zu viele Drogen genommen. Sie ist tot. Sie war nur achtzehn!” Die Eltern machten Sorge über die Gesundheit ihrer Tochter und versprachen, dass für ihr ganzes Leben, wäre Emily völlig sicher.

Genau achtzehn Jahren später war Emily im Straßencafé. Sie saß allein und trank ihr Kaffee, während sie sah andere Personen an. Ihr war langweilig, weil es überhaupt nichts interessantes gab. Es war ihr Geburtstag, und sie hatte keine Aufregung, keine Romanze. Sie hatte gute Eltern, und gute Freunde, aber nichts außergewöhnliches. Ihr Leben war einfach langweilig.

Sie bestellte ein Cognac, weil sie bis jetzt kein Alkohol trank, da sie erst achtzehn war. 

Sie goss der Cognac in den Kaffee.

Sie trank der Kaffee.

Les exhibitionnistes de type impulsif-obsessionnel vivent leurs pulsions de manière relativement similaires aux obsessions et compulsions : ils luttent contre elles, en reconnaissent le caractère délictueux ou absurde, mais finissent par ne plus résister à cette force considérée comme étrangère ou difficile à contrôler. Quand il y’a passage à l’acte, il est suivie de honte et de remords.

Les exhibitionnistes réactionnels présentent des épisodes en réponses à des frustrations, des troubles de l’humeur ou des problèmes relationnels.

Les exhibitionnistes névrotiques recherchent vraisemblablement l’autopunition par l’humiliation dans leur acte d’exposition. L’anxiété est très présente et diminue avec le soulagement de la pulsion. Ces exhibitionnistes ne sont généralement pas dangereux et peuvent se satisfaire de leur imagination, ou tourner vers un exhibitionnisme zoophile.

Les exhibitionnistes de type pervers sont également multirécidivistes et associent généralement d’autres types de délinquance. Contrairement au mode névrotique, ils éprouvent peu de remords et tirent une grande satisfaction des vives réactions suscitées par leurs victimes, ce qui laisse à craindre une escalade vers des passages à l’acte plus agressifs.

Also you're wrong! Commies were actively ghettoizing Roma, especially in the 80s. The infamous [Chanov settlement] (http://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%ADdli%C5%A1t%C4%9B_Chanov) was completely devised by the state who moved all the Roma there from areas of rich coal deposits.

If there is a Roma culture, nobody knows what that is. Roma are not Travellers, there may be nomadic Roma somewhere but the ones we see are sedentary for generations. Where I live - Bucharest - there are groups of _homeless_ Roma, but that's not a cultural trait, just chronic poverty.

I don't think gypsies try in any way to isolate themselves, more the other way around. Poverty breeds distrust and stigma. Vicious circle, hard to break. Kids born in such communities grow up with pickpockets, burglars and prostitutes, where respect is proportional to time spent in jail.

The biggest trading partners by volume in the world are the United States and China, and differing currencies doesn't seem to have hindered bilateral trade. Another example is Turkey, whose biggest trading partner is the EU, and differing currencies doesn't seem to have hindered trade here either. 

Some of the arguments that you cite in favor of the euro, do not actually require it to realize their benefits. The cost of exchanging money can be reduced by modernizing and streamlining FOREX trading platforms, or allowing banks to issue payments cards that do the conversion automatically depending on where the customers is using them. Red tape when transferring money across borders has been already largely resolved by the SEPA system. Low interest rates are not necessarily a good thing - they are the main culprit for the inflating of the housing bubble and the subsequent burst in 2008 that wrought havoc all over the world financial markets. Playing with and manipulating interests rates is the most egregious form of price controls, and as the recent LIBOR scandal in the UK has shown it can have disastrous consequences on savers, especially pension funds and the insurance industry. 

You can write volumes of theoretical arguments about the benefits of the euro, but the facts on the ground are that the euro has been a complete and unmitigated disaster for the people in Greece, Spain, and now increasingly Italy and France. I predict that it won't last for much longer in its current form. It will probably split into two - with the Germanic countries of the north maintaining a monetary union, while the Latin countries of the south + Greece revert back to their national currencies that they can then inflate at will.

I want to speak for my region, native Baden - the nicer part of the state Baden-Württemberg in the [German South-West](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Baden).

It is true, indeed, that my dialect changes within a distance of a few kilometres. It can be as little as 2 kilometres to the next village. It's possible that certain words are being replaced by completely unrelated other words, that the pronounciation changes, or even the grammar.

One of the main characteristics of my dialect is not only the concatenation of words, the blatant disregard of standard German grammar or the rather soft pronunciation of combinations like 'sp' [shp] or 'st' [shd], it's mostly the speech melody that is unique to this region. It's possible to learn to speak standard German and get your pronunciation right but I have yet to meet a person who managed to get rid of this revealing speech melody.

It takes me probably two sentences in standard German from a complete stranger anywhere in this world to know exactly that he's actually from my homeland; which is a rather cool feature since I work and live in Berlin far away from home. Two more sentences in this stranger's native dialect and I'm pretty sure to know where in Baden he lived - give or take 20 kilometres.

My dialect is influenced by French grammar and Alemannic pronunciation the farther you move westward - or southward respectively.

Personally, I'm one of those people who can't or don't care to speak standard German which is often frowned upon by people from the northern half of Germany. But it's part of my identity. I also found sticking to my dialect gives me a certain edge in the long run compared to the ""standardised"" Germans.

Of course this countries are doing fine and will be ok inside eurozone, outside of it or in other places, because there are 3-5 times richer per capita than Poland, have good institutions, developed economies, strong industry. On the other side Poland's fast growth depends in large degree on funds from the EU. These funds will be flowing till 2020 (if current EU budget is accepted), but after that date EU will probably divide and a separate budget for closer bounded Eurozone will appear. This is the main rationale for the current polish government to get Euro. If EU stayed in its current shape then joining the Eurozone would be less profitable, but now in the face of changes in EU there is a significant risk of being left behind without (or with severley diminished) funds. Possible problems like lower competitiveness or paying for troubles of other countries are considered as less important.

Discussion about interest rates is too technical for me - I'm not an economist. 

DDR example as a state that lost on joining into some monetary union is only partially good. Situation there has nevertheless improved, right? Maybe not as far as someone would expect looking at the money pumped there, but there is a progress.

You ask me how Poland wants to prevent the predicted loss of competitiveness due to higher salaries. I don't know if there is some plan but i would assume, that, with investments (due to GDP growth) in machines, hi-tech solution, better organization and education, productivity will rise increasing competitiveness. Not sure if this will happen fast enough, or at all but there is a chance.

Now, I'm not 100% sure about this, whether entering euro will benefit some country depends on unpredictable, future trends and events. As i said before there are pros and cons.

Do you even know the level of difference between the funds for example the DDR received and that Poland will receive? Let me give you a hint. You are not 20 millions, who's foreign debt will be taken care of by someone else, and you will not receive trillions. 

What you are assuming, is that by 2020, the Eurozone, and it this matter you mean, the Germans/French/Finns. for some reason will be pleased to send you money, not through the EU, but, just because they like you, the taxpayers will be willing to send you extra billion. What are you basing this assumption on?  Why would the Netherlands pay billions to the Poles, outside of the Eu? I think it sounds mad.


You are also claiming that you will receive this, since you are sure they can afford it. In 2020, they will have supported southern Europe for 7 years. Are you sure, the French will just think. Gee- our economy hasn't grown in 8 years, but I'll just love to spend some money on Poland outside of the EU.....

Honestly, to me it sounds very, very, naive, and I wouldn't bet a single zloty on it. Do you have *any* evidence fo the fact that the Eurozone will like you more than southern Europe so they will just be happy to throw money on your?

Do you also understand, by saing this, you are admitting to that you will not be competitive enough. How are you then going to deal with the loss in competitiveness.

&gt;Discussion about interest rates is too technical for me - I'm not an economist. 

Well, learn the basics, Poland is  fucking up your economy, and the reasoning I have presented to you is Economics 101.  Ask the Irish/Spanish/Portugues. Do you think they are just irresponsible or lazy, or so you think I might be on to something, with my talk about interest rates and competiveness? . In ten years, trust me, I will vote no to aid to Poland. You knew what you were doing. Honestly, you can not leave this to economists. By ignoring it, you are supporting it. Is that your final word - you do not have the energy to learn?


&gt;Situation there has nevertheless improved, right?

Of course, after 22 years and trillions pumpedin and the fact that they  *still* receive over 100 billion Euros/year, not foreign debt and another country taking care of the essentials, like welfare - and they ar still not as competitive, but as you say, they are improving.....

 So, considering that Spain/Greece/Poland, will receive none of that help, I am sure you will be just as competitive in 40-50 years. Just suffer until 2063- then you will be fine.
'
&gt;I don't know if there is some plan but i would assume, that, with investments (due to GDP growth) in machines, hi-tech solution, better organization and education, productivity will rise increasing competitiveness. Not sure if this will happen fast enough, or at all but there is a chance.

You do not know of the plan? I asked what you did *different* from Greece/Ireland/Spain etc. You do know that they had exactly the things your are saying too -. quote by quote (GDP growth, machines, hi-tech solutions, better organization, education, prodctivity etc). I asked what made you *different*. They had all that too - and look where they are. What makes Poland so special?

 Why do you think, Poland can escape Economics 101 - your competitiveness *will* suffer, just likes Spains. Your debt *will* rise, just like Irelands. Your productivity will go down, and your prices and salaries will rise, just like Greece. Why is Poland beyond the statistics of economics. 

I'll give you a hint - you are not. But please, give me the links to the Economic statistic that says otherwise. 



I hope for your sake that you are right, but I do not believe that for a second.  It will not happen in the next year, but in the next 5-10, maybe quicker. Good luck Poland, you are going to need it.

We're talking about the economy here, there's no single variable that accounts for unemployment. Though it's pretty clear that the minimum wage is definitely one of it, you have to ignore reality to think this isn't the case.

Italy has been implementing austerity measures, Cyprus I won't comment much as I know very little other than them being till recently under a communist government and with regards to Macedonia, it's no wonder considering their recent history. As for the Netherlands, well, there are other factors that account for this, though they'd be even better off in this regard without a statutory minimum wage.

&gt;Looking at it, the general economical/social situation (particularly the strict labour laws) has far more importance in the general outlook of the job market.

true,Johanu,DENK,Home away from home,"People believe such drastic cut in government expenditure on the economy caused the current breakdown in disposable income people have  had, and therefore less spending in companies products is possible. And you still have to account for the ""severe increase in taxes"" we had, leading to even less available funds. 

This, in turn, leads to more unemployment due to the factories and stores closing due to the lack of sales, which increases the state expenditure on social welfare. Less economic activity also reduces the tax collected, which is why we NEVER collect as much tax as predicted by the government in the yearly budget.

We managed to stay afloat the last two years due to the growing exports. However, Europe, our biggest buyer by far, is entering another recession, so the exports growth has stagnated, as evidenced by the first quarter report published a few weeks ago.

Now, take a wild guess at what are the measures used to fight this reduced tax collection and increased expenditure? You guessed it, more austerity! And the cycle continues, on and on, until some camel has its back broken by the proverbial straw.

**Ninja Edit:** Forgot to reply with an alternative to austerity. Well, in reality, I really don't have any. I agree we should strive for less government in our economy and less government spending, but in reality I don't believe we can do much now other than weather this until the rest of Europe is in strong growth, allowing us to increase our exports for a few years. 

The sad reality is that the Euro, however liked by us as a unifying aspect of our shared culture, is too strong for us to be competitive with the rest of the world. Germany is fighting hard to keep the Southern economies in the Eurozone mainly because we pull its value down, which helps a former strong currency country such as them to be more competitive through a falsely devalued currency. The opposite is true for us.

When an economy crashes during a sovereign debt crisis, the state doesn't have the means to kick-start the economy with growth measures such as increased expenditure. So, two measures remain available for an economy to recover and are usually used in conjunction: devalue your currency to become more competitive in the export market, or decrease the work costs, the so-called ""race to the bottom"", either by reducing taxes to companies or by reducing wages. 

It's established that the first isn't available to us, and therefore all that remains is reducing costs. Since we're in a sovereign debt crisis as well, we really can't reduce taxes, so the reduction in wages must occur for us to be more competitive. Problem is, we're still inside the Schengen Space and we can leave whenever we feel like it. And we do, usually the young and educated, which leaves us with the cost of education engineers, scientists and what-not, but not the benefit of them using their education to improve the country.

My solution is by-gone by now, I believe we should have kick-started the economy back in 2009 or 2010 if we could, but hindsight is 20/20. Obama, arguably to the right of most Portuguese politicians, did exactly that and we can see the US starting to recover better than us.

And I agreed with the new renting law, it's a much overdue law and that's why many where still paying around 30€/month for rent.

The answer is that without extreme social change for the worse we'll never leave this cycle. Leaving the Euro is an option, even after we get out of this crisis the next will be around the corner due to it being overvalued for us. That'd be disastrous in the short term, but the jury is still out on whether it'd be good in the long-term. We'd have to restructure our debt, increase the payout time-frame, but Greece has already done it and it's better for it.

On the side of structural changes, I'd say economic monopolies, corruption and the justice system are what's holding us back the most. A good and fast justice system encourages foreign investment and business stability. Debts are taken care of much faster and business opportunities don't drag in court due to some injunction preventing it. 

Most economic monopolies have been taken care of, while creating new ones such as the recently signed airport concession agreement. One company now owns the rights to manage all our airports for the next 50 years. That'll be really costly in terms of competitiveness in the long run, but not nearly as when, for the sake of budget compliance, we package the concession for all our sea ports and sell it to one company. The recently announced merge of the port authorities is indicative of this. 

Finally, corruption. A good justice system is part of the answer to this one. I also believe there should be much less opportunity for corruption. This is tackled by increasing the transparency of governmental spending and contracting. Also, there should be much fewer politically appointed jobs.

Furthermore, I believe a referendum on regional governments should be had. I think competition is important and is propelled by regional governance. The usage of QREN money for the poorer regions in Lisbon under the guise of possible spill-over effect was an absolute travesty, the European Council did nothing about it and millions were spent in our capital city, which has a GDP per capita higher than the European Union average.

It's rather hard to a croatian to read serbian or bosnian and vice versa; the languages have been rather forcefully changed in the last 20 years, yes, but I have heard from quite a number of people that it's hard for them to read serbian/croatian/bosnian.

A friend in college is a croatian from central Bosnia, her town has a croatian high school, but the only croatian uni's are in Mostar, which is too far away; she can't handle bosnian, because the terminology is too different; so close, yet so far.

Also, my dad works with a number of serbians; apart from work (administrative writing style), they say it's hard reading, let's say, a novel in croatian. It just like you're constantly bugged that somenthing is wrong, and you know it's not and it is, and it's not, etc., etc.

Apart from that, it's hard for me to read serbian too, and I'm from the east of the country (closer to Serbia) - people far more to the centre or south confund my accent with Serbian, even though it's quite obvious I speak ""ije/je"", not ""je/e"".


Apart from that, my (now deceased) former latin prof. said he was studying names and dialects of Croatia in his free time, and that a few of his fellow linguists have come to a conclusion that Croatia is one of the rare countries in Europe where there can be said (linguisticaly speaking) that almost every village (mainly Međimurje, Zagorje) and every island has it's own accent, it's dialect within a dialect.

There are basically 3 tiers of stores. On the bottom, there are small ""discounters"" like Aldi, Lidl, Penny, Netto that have basic items (usually not more than 1 of each kind, in total around 1000) and mostly store brands; Aldi almost exclusively so. In my opinion, the Aldi store brands are the absolute best, often beating international brands at twice the price. Lidl store brands are good too. Penny and Netto are o.k..

Next up are midsize-stores like Edeka and Rewe and larger department stores like Marktkauf, Kaufland, and Real. They will feature more than one brand for each item and offer much more variety, often also carrying electronics, sports items and clothing. Their store brands like TIP and ja! are often very shitty in my opinion though.

If you have a free choice, try out Aldi, Lidl, and Rewe first. My favorites.

true,TheMania,null,null,"A country consumes what it produces *less* its net exports.

At that, whilst exports boost your GDP - they are actually a cost to your consumption. They are your people working for foreigners instead of providing goods/services for local consumption. If you share a currency what you gain from exporting is more of the currency you share. If you don't, your reward for exporting is the ability to import.

So with a free floating exchange rate, exports are the cost of imports.

Now the important thing to realise is that as long as your country *can* export enough real goods/services to be able to trade for the imports it needs, everything is OK. If it can't, it's simply not sustainable no matter what monetary system you use - it'd not be able to function without foreign aid or foreign loans. Greece used to have a free-floating currency and all debt denominated in that currency - it was clearly in the former category. Since the Euro though, they've been borrowing in a way they may not be able to pay back. Hence the collapse.

&gt; Wouldn't a great way to inject money in the economy be to just transfer x € to each Eurozone citizen, monthly?

When you consider that it's literally just a shortage of money preventing growth in so many countries right now - absolutely. There is no way that providing a few hundred €s each would not increase production across the EMU. In fact, that's what Australia did at the start of the GFC - gave every pensioner $900 each, and then a second round of giving *everyone* $850. The idea being that if you give someone an unexpected windfall, they will spend it. Many also paid down debt yes, but that just gives them the ability to spend sooner than had they not. On top of this, the government additionally started longer term infrastructure spending - with the aim of the flow-on effects of that picking up as the cash splash ran down.

Critics though argue for [Ricardian Equivalence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardian_equivalence) - that if you were to do this, or virtually any form of stimulus measure, people would just assume it's going to be taxed back later once the economy recovers and so have no net effect. They'd just put it aside, waiting for the taxes to come. I don't believe this theory to hold up in reality - if it did, austerity would have worked and Australia wouldn't have seen a spending boom coinciding to the cash splash.

He's alright but understand that he had very little to do with letting the banks fail and when everything was going swinging during the earlier part of the 21st century he supported the bankers as much as anybody.

If he refuses to sign the law, the public gets to vote on it. This power had never been used by a president ever before he did it with the Icesave referendum a few years ago. The government had decided to pay back those debts but he wanted the people to decide if they wanted to, the people voted no and in the end the European court ruled in Iceland's favor.

Because it's the natural system that arises when we want to get the most out of what we are exchanging. 

Capitalism = flow of capital for monetary or emotional profit.

Of course it does, for people with wages below or near the poverty line. It helps the fight against social exclusion, allowing their children to have a better future. It also closes loopholes, where employers are able to bend the legal framework to their advantage (and to workers' plight).

&gt; How does limiting employment increase consumption? [...] Then why stop at an 8.5€/hour? Why not 10€/hour or 20€/hour or 50€/hour?

It doesn't limit employment. We're not talking about people on €500 per month suddenly getting €1500 per month, thus making their employers unable to pay them. On average, it's a small but significant increase. These people will now have access to more products and services. The increased demand will help in creating more jobs.

No, because it's not that simple, as others pointed out. It's an equation with multiple variables.

No, it does not.

&gt;It helps the fight against social exclusion

By making it that much harder to employ these people?

&gt;allowing their children to have a better future

An higher income achieves that, but higher income isn't achieved by an higher minimum wage, it's achieved by higher productivity.

&gt;It also closes loopholes, where employers are able to bend the legal framework to their advantage (and to workers' plight).

What loopholes?

And the ""employers exploiting employees"" talk is ridiculous, employers always want to minimise costs just as much as employees want to increase wages, if you do want to increase the income of the average working people, you need to allow for them to increase their skills and to reduce the unemployment rate, and that's achieved with better education and easier access to the labour market, not with restrictions on whom or how one can or cannot employ somebody.

&gt;We're not talking about people on €500 per month suddenly getting €1500 per month, thus making their employers unable to pay them.

No, we're talking about people that for some reason (most likely because they're young and unqualified) don't justify an wage that happens to be below the minimum wage they're trying to set into law and that will be left without a job because for the minimum wage, employers would rather employ somebody else more qualified.

In trying to help the people in the worst conditions, you just made it that much more difficult for them to find and held a job.

What you should do is instead remove the restrictions on the labour market so that employment would go down (which would then allow for the workers to have more bargaining power and subsequently higher wages) and that people who are worse off would more easily held an employment and improve their qualifications on the job (though this can also be achieved with a better education system).

&gt;On average, it's a small but significant increase.

Which is a bad thing, the higher the minimum wage, the more people will be affected by it and will have an harder time finding a job.

&gt;These people will now have access to more products and services.

No, they will not, they'll most definitely lose the jobs they already have - employers aren't charitable organisations, they need to make a profit to stay in business, they will either have to hire more qualified people that do justify an wage higher that the minimum one (thus increasing unemployment for those who have less skills) or they'll be operating on a loss and have an harder time staying in business (thus increasing overall unemployment on a long period of time).

&gt;The increased demand will help in creating more jobs.

Increased demand comes with increased income which in turn comes from higher productivity, not out of any law such as the minimum wage. I'm sorry but to assume that restricting employment will ever increase employment is ludicrous.

&gt;No, because it's not that simple, as others pointed out. It's an equation with multiple variables.

That's like saying while we do know that f(w)=x+y+z, that you can't prove that y accounts into w because there are other variables. The overall trend is clear, the higher the minimum wage, the more people affected by it and therefore more people end up unemployed.",1,1362224562,null,0,false,0,c8odkcd,t3_19hdv6,t1_c8odkcd,t1_c8odfj9,null,1431458708,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2
