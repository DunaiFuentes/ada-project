Soldiers in Afghanistan improved their jeeps with metal plates and a cage, like the US troops did it, and guess what: They had to remove all of that because it would not get approved for use in civilian traffic in Germany.

Ever wondered why there are so few videos of helmet cameras or embedded journalists? Because nobody wants to be a ""Kameradenschwein"". See, when some bureaucrats in Germany saw these videos and one of the soldiers was not properly shaved, wore parts of his uniform incorrectly (means: more practical for the enviroment he is in) or other stuff (like the thing with the jeeps), they pressed charges against them!

For a long time, they were not allowed to fight. Yes, we sent soldiers to war but they were not allowed to fight. If they got attacked, they were allowed to defend themselfes, but if the enemy suddenly retreated, they were not allowed to follow and had to stop shooting. If they didn't, they were under investigation for murder.

Politicians told our people that we are just there to build schools and help people and everyone was very surprised that there were actually guys shooting at our soldiers! Public felt betrayed.

All this made our soldiers ""easy targets"" and led to increased attacks on them. The Taliban knew we were the weakest link in the chain of NATO nations. Eventually, the situation in the north got so bad that the rules of engagement had to be changed.

In Cinque Terre, theres a beautiful bar just off to the right, before rio maggiore. most of that segment is a boardwalk along the sea cliffs. V. different from the rest of the hiking in cinque terre. 

As far as logding there, any town you stay in will have apartments for rent, but can often be costly. a good alternative would be to look in the neighboring city of la spezia. theres a lot of nice, small hotels around, and you can take the train to and from cinque terre to start your days.

Also i highly recommend bringing a bathing suit and towel with you when you hike to vernazza. Theres a lot of big flat rocks you can hang out and go swimming off of. quite a nice spot. Definitely my favorite town of the five.

Restaurants, you have to find the vegan ones, because normal places will most certainly get annoyed (lets say customer service is not the most friendly).

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;Yeah, so what?

That means that the succes of that policy depends on the willingness and ability of other entities in the world economy to play the role of net importer.

&gt;If you want to see an example of this, look at the pork cycle. It is clear that the fluctuations are bad, but even then, if everybody does what is rational, the fluctuations occur. Proven in 1994 by Rosen, Murphy and Scheinkman.

Which proves that the conventional economical definition of ""rational"" could better be labeled ""delusionally short-sighted"".

&gt;If there's trade, obviously somebody wants to buy. That's the very definition of trade.

If becoming a net exporter is the way to go, why wouldn't they follow the same policy? If they're not, how are they going to pay for it?

&gt;Trade deficits can be alleviated by tourism of the exporting countries in the importing countries, for example. Germany and China are prime examples of that.

... I wouldn't call the situation in Southern Europe *alleviated*. China's tourism expenses are still only a fraction of their exports too.

&gt;Ever thought of a dynamic instead of a static solution? Some decades, it's country A with the deficit, B rakes in the surplus, after a while, the pendulum swings in the other direction.

Then why panic if we're *not* having a surplus for the time being? You just say that's not going to happen anyway.

&gt;Read up on mercantilism, please. To export more than you import is a symptom, nothing else. I don't see anything which characterizes mercantilism in the current situation here.

It's not because you close your eyes that the sun doesn't exist. With a Master's in history, I'm quite familiar enough with it to know that you're bluffing. Suffice to quote the first two sentences of even just the wikipedia article: ""Mercantilism is the economic doctrine that government control of foreign trade is of paramount importance for ensuring the military security of the country. In particular, it demands a positive balance of trade."" Achieving that trade surplus is the main goal, although the means to do so may vary.

&gt;Yes, and it might come again and be unavoidable, see pork cycle.

And yet you support it?

&gt;Please give concrete examples of this. Not by showing symptoms like inbalanced trade, but by showing dirigistic root causes.

If the phenomenon/symptom is bad enough, why even strive to stimulate it? Why does it matter what caused it?

&gt;Won't ever happen, the only realistic variant of this are fluctuations over time, where deficits and surpluses switch from A to B and back.

Of course. That makes it possible and desirable to strive for balanced trade and stay close to the target, while maintaining prosperity. Striving for an unbalanced trade, even when succesful, will never succeed, and the fluctuations when that imbalance corrects itself cause economic damage that's avoidable.

They don't want to remain in Europe. They want to keep their costs as they are, and if possible to cut them down a little. That's why they're using the bye-bye strategy, and they will resort to it no matter what happens in the Referendum.

true,petshaver,LITH,Lithuania,"Frankly, I was carefully choosing words for my previous reply to you, as this is a sensitive issue on more than one level (both LGBT rights and propaganda issues) and I wouldn't really like the discussion to heat up too much.

I do agree with you that the reporter (not an invited guest, as you seem to imply) has hijacked the show to make an unrelated point. I also agree that the rest of the journalists handed it professionally, in a crisis management sense. As for your statement that there's a high chance it wouldn't be aired at all on a different network, I believe that's a moot point, as everything was happening live on air.

However, I'm certain that RT is much more biased than Western media, even much more than the notorious Fox News. RT constantly emphasize that they are independent and autonomous, which is obviously not true both in the matters of financing and in controlling its content by the Russian government. I truly believe that it's the mouthpiece of Kremlin, and its main purpose is to pursue political agenda.

You might say that it's a natural thing it works that way. That it's only logical that the view of the network corresponds to the politics of its home country. And you would be right, as it's happening elsewhere as well. I'm not familiar with Chinese issues well enough to be a good judge, but I wouldn't trust Chinese CCTV on some issues. Also, I'm familiar with the fact that Arabic and English versions of Al-Jazeera actually tend to reflect some issues differently, as they cater for different audiences.

Now let's talk about Western media. Is it ideal? Absolutely unbiased? Totally free from external influences? No, no, and no. But if your point is that Western media has the same level of propaganda in its programming as RT does, I would absolutely disagree with that. It does not compare, it's on a whole different level, period.

Everything that one has to do is to go to [their website](http://rt.com) and simply count how many positive and negative stories are being reported on Russian and US issues. Is there much criticism about the Russian government? One just needs to compare it to the level of criticism that Western media makes against their own governments. It doesn't take a genius or to know specifics of Russian politics to see it.

The difference is that they have to pay for your exports with the value they produce. If it's like racing, it's a race where everyone is tied together with a rubber band. You're going to tire yourself, drag people over and smack back together in the end for no good reason. Competing for market share is economic trench warfare: armchair generals sacrificing the foot soldiers/living standards of the common man to gain a few 100 m of trenches/a slight export surplus.

&gt;Everything boils down to being competitive, to have a good hand in this global game of cards. Get the good hand first, then you have all options.

Of course maintaining your position also requires attention to competion. Striving for a trade surplus is completely different. It's the fallacy of scale: you don't run a state like you run a business. The point of a state is to maintain itself and the welfare of its citizens, not to gain market share for the sake of gaining market share.

&gt;What you and others are advising is doing nothing

If you're going to attack ideas you yourself made up why bother to post comments on a discussion board at all? Take your straw men elsewhere.

Making a new state that small, doubling the cost of running it, adding a new layer of corruption (Catalonia is one of the most corrupt regions of Spain already), having to rejoin everything again, would obviously be terrible for their economy and people's everyday lives, and what would they get in return? Oh a new flag, awesome. Catalan politicians know this, but all they care for is the budget they'll get to manage and steal from, which is why they've been telling an entire Catalan generation about how they're so incredibly different from the rest of Spain (spoiler: bullshit; better compare both with the Finnish, and the Finnish will still be twin brothers when compared to the Japanese, now that's a different culture), and how they were an independent empire with an army ninja pirates who spoke Catalan before Babylonia even existed, how they invented the Internet and everything in the Universe including the Universe, and so on — it kinda looks like North Korea, which is extremely saddening. Catalonia has an entire generation of nationalist tools.

In the end, if Catalonia separates from Spain, nothing of value will be lost for Spain, and nothing of value will be lost for Catalonia either, though the later will have a harder time because of what I said in my previous paragraph.

A much better approach would be to end with the stupid nationalism, end with our current countries (e.g. Spain) and their bloody frontiers, and create a political European Union with a single democratic state (one can dream it could be similar to Switzerland; one can dream). That would reduce administration costs, reduce or end financial exploitation, better protect our economy and development, make our European culture and stand much stronger in international politics, spread better environmental policies to crappier European countries (e.g. Spain), equalize and overall improve quality of life and overall do the better service to our citizens in their everyday lives. So far the EU has only benefited businesses; this would change with a real European Union.

No, some Eurozone countries did. You do not seem to distinguish between Europe, the EU and the Eurozone. Most of Europe did *not* help Cyprus, so when someone whine on all of Europe, all of EU, they really should say, ""we should have gotten more money from Germany"". 


&gt;Given that Europe did help, they shouldn't have handed Cyprus to the russians

Why not? At least they have some banks now. Because the Russians are so corrupt? Unlike the situation in other EU countries, like Bulgaria for example, where all is extremely nice, and no corruption whatsoever? So, why is it worse if Cyprus us corrupt than any other country then. Shouldn't we start with the bigger countries, trying to help them - *if* it is a thing for the EU to do. I do not think it is, nor is it in any treaty. Furthermore - why did Cyprus build up such an industry? What did they expect? 

Also, why should poorer countries bail out acountry that willingly build their industry on the russians? Should the Bulgarians bail out Cyprus so they do not become poor and corrupt, with a lot of Russian influences, like Bulgaria? 

It seems to me that some cypriots is blaming their current situation on anything but themselves, and expect other countries to solve it. No country, ever, anywhere, will get anything done, or anything solved, with that attitide

&gt; Catalonia is one of the most corrupt regions of Spain already


Any reference? A quick google search shows Murcia, Andalucia, CLM, Extremadura as strongly more corrupt. No one should talk about corruption actually.



&gt; what would they get in return? Oh a new flag, awesome.

Also real political autonomy, since the political domination of Madrid over the peripheria has created a fiscal and labour deficit which is centrifugating debt and precariety. In our case the fiscal deficit is 16.000 MEUR, ~8% of our GDP. (And, no, that's not solidarity but a brive and charity from the central government to other CCAA).

&gt; they've been telling an entire Catalan generation about how they're so incredibly different from the rest of Spain

Of course we're more similar than I am to a japanese or a finnish. A discriminant analysis can tell me that. But still, there is a difference in our culture and language, right? But no one has claimed our culture is better than yours, simply is equally good; that's what some spaniards don't like: 


-Hey, our culture, the catalan culture, is not inferior to yours.  

-So, you mean is superior to mine, which is shared by a bazillion people? You nazi!  

-No, I mean is equall...

-Nazi!


For instance, when a fellow redditor argued a few days ago that when we catalans are speaking with a spaniard we should change from our ""regional language"" to spanish, since we know it. That's how you conceive spain: spanish and spanish culture for everybody by default, and then, if you want you can speak with your kin your ""regional language"".

&gt;  it kinda looks like North Korea

Yeah, very adequate comparation.

&gt; and how they were an independent empire with an army ninja pirates who spoke Catalan before Babylonia even existed, how they invented the Internet and everything in the Universe including the Universe

Straw man argument? How nice from you.

&gt; every petty, megalomaniac regional chieftain wants to play SimCountry.

You bought the version ""Artur Mas is misleading the catalans""? Because it's a wrong interpretation of what happened in the last 11-S. Mas, the government and pretty much all parties were overcame by civil society. We want independence, and we're voting for it through elections and in a future referendum. We gave an oportunity to CiU. If they don't behave, they're finished, and they know it. 

Spanish media have been disconnected from the catalan public opinion since the estatut's referendum. They didn't understand what the low participation meant, and therefore they're unable to understand what's going on now.

&gt; a single democratic state [...] would reduce administration costs, reduce or end financial exploitation, better protect our economy and development.

Again, did you made an optimization of service's functions or you're just feeling ""it's like this and it's true""? Do you think a single hospital for all Europe would be better than our current situation? That would be an enormous saving in administration costs... right?. In case you don't know, the EU is also pushing for public services' decentralization, as well as gaining some soveraignity for Brussels in other areas. This is what is killing the central government of Spain.

1) come dicono gli ammeregani ""location, location, location"". dipende. tieni presente che anche i mezzi di superficie sono parecchi e non fanno troppo schifo, anche se vanno più lenti della metro. Alcuni hanno le corsie preferenziali (es. la 90) e quindi vanno abbastanza bene. Inoltre se hai la macchina può essere problematico stare all'interno della cerchia filotramviaria (viale marche, viale jenner, ecc quella della 90 insomma) perchè i parcheggi sono quasi tutti per residenti (ma puoi avere il pass presentando un po' di carte, tra cui il contratto d'affitto). Dall'altra parte ti sconsiglio di allontanarti (troppo) dalla cerchia filotramviaria, è da lì che inizia la savana.
La zona di Loreto o Wagner sono molto carine, se puoi stare più in centro anche porta venezia, repubblica, moscova, sempione, conciliazione sono prestigiose, se ti muovi in macchina o con i mezzi di superficie non andrei più lontano di così. Non sono un fan della zona della stazione centrale, viale monte ceneri, viale certosa, lotto, offrono poco. Con la metro penso potresti fare anche porta genova - porta garibaldi in un tempo accettabile (intorno ai 20 minuti credo).

2) una singola dai 400 ai 600, un monolocale da 600 a 800, più spese (sui 50 se condividi, magari anche 100 se sei solo e le spese condominiali sono alte)... le esperienze nella condivisione di case non sono molto dissimili da quelle che ho avuto da 20enne...

3) il motorino è sicuramente il mezzo più comodo per spostarsi a milano, secondo me una volta che ci hai fatto l'abitudine non è una tragedia, il traffico è ""nervoso ma prevedibile"". Ci sono i mezzi notturni (non tutti però: se guardi sul sito atm-mi.it, sono quelli che iniziano per N. N90, N6, N50, ...) ma se intendi servirtene spesso ti conviene cercare casa all'interno della cerchia filotramviaria, imho.

4) costo della vita... boh? abbonamento mensile ai mezzi mi pare 45€, aperitivo 8-10€, un pranzo di lavoro probabilmente sui 8-10€ (lavoro un po' fuori, non so per certo), un kg di mozzarella di bufala 15€ :P

5) il traffico, la varietà, in riunione, dal pranzo

The EU has no responsibility whatsoever for neither Cyprus economy or Cyprus's banks. How can you say that they surrendered? 

&gt;Eurozone partner's economy straight into a rival's hands. 

It is possible that it would have been far more expensive, not to say agains the treaties to save it. The EU has no responsibility for that, nor does the Eurozone if you read the treaties. 

Also, if you say yes to bailing out Cyprus, with how much money? for how long? Why Cyprus above Bulgaria for example, (you are richer), which countries should do the bail out, and what is Cyprus responsibility in all of this? Should, or shouldn't we follow treaties?

Cyprus was helped (as opposed to e.g. Bulgaria) because (1) their banking crisis triggered systemic collapse of the country and (2) the small size of the country made it relatively affordable (~1/4 of Bulgaria's economy).
The intervention was _not_ made to combat corruption.

So you can compare two cities from a given set, it´s interesting. Not perfect data but pretty good at giving an idea for most places I have been to.

&gt;Striving for a trade surplus is completely different. 

*This* is what is wrong with your arguments. Nobody should strive for a trade surplus. If you do this with your average goods, you have mercantilism, since you need dirigistic ways to achieve your means.

But you strive to:

* build the *best* cars
* make the *best* medicine
* have the *best* machinery etc.

and have the government assist the industry achieving these goals (--&gt; Japanese MITI, for example). Trade surplus is just a side effect. Others need to come up with better goods to counter. Otherwise *they* are guilty of mercantilism.

Yes. But it should be obvious that my opinion is biased. Is this a sincere question? Why are you asking me this? Did you expect a different answer?

By the European Stability Mechanism. *European*. ***Stability***. *Mechanism*. Because that's what it was created for. Supposed to do what it says on the tin.

Until said stability is achieved, naturally. Or we can just rename the ESM to European Schadenfreude Mechanism.

Other countries **did, do and will** receive a lot of help. Cyprus was just a drop in the bucket.

I will not comment on that. It's just bait to steer the conversation further away from the topic at hand. Sorry mate, no courage left.

Smart people were supposed to figure that out. They failed and that's the problem with imposed ""leaders"" who took it upon themselves to confidently and thoroughly fuck things up.

Nel caso, ogni giorno guadagnato è un giorno di vita in più per il governo.

* Si va al voto, il Pd caccia Berlusconi e un minuto dopo il governo muore. A quel punto possono succedere due cose:

a) Si cerca un'altra maggioranza e la si trova: vuol dire che in Senato Pd e Sel (115 voti in due) hanno trovato 50 persone tra montiani e transfughi di Cinque stelle (che in blocco non vengono) e Pdl (che in blocco non vengono) per votare la fiducia. Governo molto debole, che fa la manovra da 20 miliardi che tocca fare e poco altro e che cade magari non alla prima, magari non alla seconda ma alla terza figura di merda sì. Si rivota col Porcellum

b) Si cerca un'altra maggioranza e non la si trova. A quel punto Napolitano si dimette (potrebbe farlo prima ma è improbabile) e tocca eleggerne un altro. Chiunque venga eletto non porta con sé una maggioranza in Senato maggiore o uguale a 158 e non può fare altro che sciogliere le Camere. Si rivota col Porcellum

La legge elettorale, comunque, non sarà cambiata.

Anyway, I'm not aiming to establish a ranking of CCAA by corruption, just to rebate what the previous redditor said, that Catalonia is one of the most corrupt CCAA. **But moreover** As I said, no one should really say anything about corruption. 

I agree with the alternance reasoning, because it applies to... pretty much everywhere. PSOE in Extremadura, Andalucia and CLM, PP in Madrid, CL and País Valencià, the LDP in Japan is an extreme case, for instance. 

What you don't seem to understand is that... we know. We know CiU are a bunch of corrupts, and we know they're playing ""la puta i la ramoneta"". That's why they're getting so much pressure, because if they don't engage in what civil society wants, they'll be erased from the parliament.

Why should Cyprus not take responsibility for your own economy? You created this and then you want other countries, poorer countries even to fix your economy. And no, poorer countries have not received help - Bulgaria and Estonia for example are poorer. What makes you so unique? 

It is an argument that you blamed the EU for not making the perfect bailout when a) the EU in no way are obliged to do so, we are in fact obliged not to bail you out according to the Maastricht treaty. B) furthermore,, you seem to ignore that Cyprus, and all other EU states are just that- independent states. C) you take no responsibility. Cyprus created this- I think you should fix it. Estonia handled their crises on their own and got stronger for it. So did Sweden and Finland. However the fact that Cyprus has problem you blame on the EU. I think that is wrong.

The fact it requires a translation is in itself a barrier. There simply is more cultural traffic between the UK/US than between other European nations and the US, or between Europe and the UK.

&gt; There are also numerous French actors and musicians well known in the States. This proves nothing.

There are more Brits.  

&gt; There are indeed a lot of really intelligent discussions that can be had about the EU’s democratic deficit and the need to respect the national sovereignty of the Member States - discussions which we should be having. But these are nowhere to be found among the anti-EU British nationalists at present.

The EU in itself is poised towards ""ever closer union"", and ultimately that means a federation of some sort. If any of the member states wishes to govern herself, she will have to leave. Noting these facts is the end of the debate. The EU is not interested in national sovereignty, and has frequently shown contempt to the idea of democratic input.

If you use the minimum amount of material to build a structure, that means a minimal amount of damage will be enough to unbalance it too.

That has not been confirmed. There is no precedent for separatist states within the EU - which Barroso confirmed when he stated that the Lisbon Treaty did not provide for it. It's yet to be seen whether or not an independent Scotland or Catalonia could claim to be a successor to the treaties negotiated by the UK or Spain.

true,expaticus,EURO,European Union,"I think that a lot people forget that the EU is, relatively speaking, still in its infancy. With this in mind it should come as no surprise that things don't always go exactly as one would wish. Look at the US as an example. When the US won its independence its first attempt at building a stable federation, the Articles of Confederation, was a complete failure. The US in its infancy under the Articles of Confederation was incapable of, well, just about everything. But rather than tearing the whole thing into pieces, they realized that their collective future was much brighter if they could figure out how to make it work rather than splitting up and going their separate ways, so they reworked the concept and came up with the Constitution - and even that needed to be tweaked and adjusted. Had the individual states decided ""to hell with, let's forget the whole thing and just go our separate ways"" then there is no way that any single one of those states would be any where near as successful and prosperous on its own as they collectively are today.  

The EU today has many failings and troubles, but it also has many positive aspects and tremendous potential for improvement. The EU is a major player on the world stage and holds a great deal of influence - however, individual European countries by themselves...not so much. But again, it is extremely naive to expect everything to work smoothly so quickly, and irresponsible to advocate scrapping the whole thing because there are (fixable) problems.

In the right stores there will be isles with ""Glutenfreien Lebensmitteln"" but to be honest I don't know exactly, best would be to chat up on the personal working there and asking right away. For restaurants, simply ask. If they can't answer your question I'd either ask another waiter or the chef. Those people are responsible for what they serve you. If they know about your problem they will help out.


&gt;3) What are polite ways of telling people that I can't eat their food without sounding like an ass? ""Es tut mir leid, aber ich kann nicht X essen, weil X""? And, how would this work for family/social events in which the host has lovingly made food (that I wouldn't be able to eat)?

""Es tut mir herzlich leid aber ich habe eine Glutenallergie und kann das leider nicht essen""
""Ich würde das sehr gerne probieren aber ich habe eine Allergie gegen Gluten, tut mir leid!""

RT cost $30 million to establish in 2005[69] and $30 million for its first year of operation. About half of the network's budget came from the state and the other half from banks and companies friendly to the government.[24] Its budget in dollars was approximately $80 million in 2007, $120 million in 2008, $380 million in 2011 and $300 million in 2012.[73][74][75] Putin has prohibited funding for Russia Today from being reduced as of October 30, 2012.[76]

However, if France is serious about this, it would be more advantageous to act as decisively as possible, which means getting just enough consensus to act. This will be impossible within the context of the UN, as China/Russia would almost certainly veto any measures proposed within the Security Council. I am not sure if France can act within the framework of the EU, I don't know enough about that. I also think acting within the framework of NATO could pose its own difficulties, as there will be many countries reluctant to act.

France, in my opinion, should therefore limit who they consult to the US and the UK to ensure the quickest consensus. Also, the US has been recently signalling that they have no interest involving itself in Syria. There are already a number of people stateside that view the Levant as Europe's backyard, thus they believe that Europe should handle Syria. There are others that do not believe this, so there is hardly consensus within the US. Whereas Obama pledged action if Syria crossed the red line with using chemical weapons, we are about to see if their is any substance to Obama's bluff, or if it was all talk.

I personally have no idea what should be done. Syria is a fucking shit show, with no good or easy courses of action to take. I do not envy those tasked with making such a decision. I just want this whole Syria mess to be resolved as quickly as possible.

But it sure is important to know what kind of bias someone has. I hope you get my point and understand that i'm not really talking about you here, but about RT. So, let's go further.

RT is sure is mouthpiece of Kremlin, but there are several points - first of all it's not like Kremlins is telling them directly what exactly to do and to say. They can't work that bluntly even in russian national TV, even though only people after 50 are watching this crap. It just isn't working that way, it's very easy to raise straight to the status of opposition supestart if you'll expose any of those ""direct orders"" from Kremlin. The following scandal will just screw any credibility Kremlin has, so they're not working that way. Especially not on RT when there is huge amount of foreign journalist who can create themselves an excellent reputation by slapping RT door after theirselves saying that it's all a propaganda network and they were pressured into doing something. Do you think Larry King for example, or all different guests from the whole world are told what to say by Kremlin? Just like this guy in the video?

Now that's one. Obviously it doesn't mean in the slightest, that RT doesn't have bias, they surely have some sctrict guidelines of what topics they need to pursue and which to avoid. Obviously topics to avoid are internal Russian politics and all that stuff. You sure won't have any valid picture of russian live just watching RT, no doubt about it.

The second point i kind of already covered - bias doesn't make your reasoning and logic any less valid. If i'm biased against a murderer of my friend for example, but i can present evidence that he's the murderer - my bias doesn't make the evidence any less valid. Look at the arguments, at what people are saying, not his bias. I mean sure bias needs to be considered in the way of ""i'm not happy how CNN covers Manning trial, let's see what RT has to say about that, they don't care about US party agenda, covering our official asses and persuading interests of Turner's media empire, let's see what they think about it"". Obviously you still shouldn't TRUST what you're hearing from them, but i would argue you shouldn't trust any media source, it's lame.

Even if RT is a mouthpiece of Kremlin, it doesn't yet mean they're wrong. They're not putting information inside you without your concern, they have facts, arguments and some kind of reasoning and that's what you need to hear instead of believing them. I understand that you distrust Russia for example, but they're not all evil lying cheating imperial bastards as you led to believe by the western media? If we start counting, then amount of good news abour Russia in western media is of order of magnitude less that amount of good RT news about the west. Would that mean that western media is biased beyond any redemption? And honestly, why exactly do you believe that some western journalists on RT who're receiving the payslip from the Kremlin are more biased that western journalists receiving the payslip from Turner media empire for example?",0,1377185325,null,0,false,0,cbt1gfz,t3_1kv0rv,t1_cbt1gfz,t1_cbswwt0,null,1429739248,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

It was basically the same thing as DuckTales, but about serious issues like racism and apartheid, refugees, the nazis, doping, corporate greed, the environment etc. The show was a Dutch-German-Japanese co-production with the Japanese expertise in animation shining through.

Number 2. Kopspijkers. This satirical show on Saturday nights was on when I was in high school and helped define me as a person. Most of all, though, this show came at the time our society needed it the most. Two wars, 9/11, rising fear of Islam, rising populism, the murder of populist politician Pim Fortuyn, the murder of controversial film maker Theo van Gogh, scandals surrounding the royal house and a general feeling of confusion in a once innocent little country defined the early 00s. Kopspijkers dealt with these issues with spot-on impressions of celebrities and great writing.

Number 1. Everything by van Kooten en de Bie, such as Keek op de Week and other shows by this legendary duo. These guys had all sorts of characters you would meet in super markets, at work, in the park, on TV or even at home. Sometimes they were experts on very specific topics or populist politicians, while the next week they played hoboes in the park or grumpy teachers. It was all instantly recognizable and they had a character for every situation or news topic. When they didn't, they simply looked around in their own environment for a person who would fit a particular sketch. Still these guys are the measure for all Dutch satire.

Also, I fail to make the same conclusions as the author of the article.

What matters to me in this case is the strictly legal position which has been clearly and officially stated by Barroso on behalf of the European Commission. It states that Scotland (or any other new country) would become a third party in case of secession and would have to reapply for EU membership.

Now, I'm totally unbiased on question of Scottish independence. I deeply believe that it should be decided by Scottish people and no one else. I'm glad that they will have a chance to say their word on this matter in a proper civilized way by holding a referendum which will be respected by the UK. Whatever they decide, so be it.

So, the German Empire from 1871 to 1918 is the second time the german states were merged into a single entity. This caused local animosity which sometimes persisted through the time. A very common example is the bavaria vs. the rest (""prussians"" from bavarian view) thing.

Another aspect is that the 3rd empire (= 3rd Reich) chose to ""hijack"" some of the personalities for their own agenda. That left a lot tainted. Even nowadays people try and sometimes succeed to rename plazas and streets as to delete for example the name Hindenburg from a very prominent place. Even though Hindenburg did never express himself positively towards Hitler and iirc was left with no choice (after 2 other choices) to name Hitler chancellor.

The last aspect is of course the nationalism and warmongering of the 2nd empire. Many even believe that Germany started the war.


So my feeling is that there is a lot of animosity in the population towards that time and my belief is that a lot of it is based on the 3rd reich and misinformation.",0,1377189018,null,0,false,0,cbt2wkn,t3_1kvp3c,t1_cbt2wkn,t3_1kvp3c,null,1429738572,4,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,4

So, price is the only problem there, isn't it? What about all the things i've listed there, ratings, marketing revenues(even if not in the case of BBC)?

(OK, ""good riddance"" perhaps, but you get my point).

Right now, such a referendum would be illegal under the Spanish Constitution (which was approved in another referendum [by a landslide](http://www.infolaso.com/politica1/35-elecciones-en-espana/715-constitucion.html), **including in Catalonia**). So, the Spanish Constitution would need to be amended first, and some conditions agreed. I'd say that at least two conditions for such a referendum should be unnegotiable:

1) The question should be clearly and unambiguously worded, [as in Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarity_Act): Independence, yes or no?

2) The seceding entity would definitely relinquish any territorial claim whatsoever over territories not taking part in the referendum.

Some other matters should also be clarified, like for example what would happen to territorial sub-units which would majoritarily vote ""no"" in a referendum (imagine for instance if the province of Barcelona votes ""no"", but the ""yes"" is overwhelming in the other provinces). Or what happens if there's a large rate of abstention.

I'm telling you all of this because I want you to understand that I have every reason to hate the Roma. I don't though. Why? Because I've seen in what sort of environment these people grew up in. The problems faced by the Roma are directly tied to class mobility and it's been proven numerous times just how hard it is to reach a higher social class. The discrimination faced by Roma in schools and when looking for employment isn't helping either. 

The idea that the Roma should just ""integrate"", as if that's some sort of magic event that once it happens all the issues surrounding this minority will just disappear into thin air, is ridiculuous. 
""Integration"" is just another word for asimilation, which is what most of the racists here on /r/europe want. These demands would not be accepted by the Catalans in Spain or the Austrians in Italy, in fact it would generate a continent-wide outrage, but it is somehow acceptable to level them at the Roma.

Also, most of the Roma you see begging on the streets of whatever city you live in are not there by choice.

That’s not a union, it’s a similarity. 

&gt; The fact it requires a translation is in itself a barrier.

Maybe, but that barrier is not as great as you imagine it to be – just turn on a television in the Netherlands and see how much the need for subtitles or dubbing has inhibited the inflow of English material onto Dutch screens: the answer is imperceptibly. Again, the only reason I mentioned Harry Potter was because it became a hit *internationally*, i.e. not just in the US. So the fact that Americans are familiar with British cultural output does not speak to any great bond between the two nations – if it did, that same bond is shared by all the rest of the world as well. It is merely an indication of the establishment of English as a global *lingua franca*. Which was exactly the initial point: most young Europeans speak perfectly fine English and the language barrier is dissolving.  

&gt; Noting these facts is the end of the debate. The EU is not interested in national sovereignty, and has frequently shown contempt to the idea of democratic input. These arguments have been made many a time by many Eurosceptics, and are typically dismissed by your sort as prejudiced nationalism.

Could that have something to do with the fact that “your sort” fail to bring any actual arguments to the table and instead just make unsubstantiated statements just like you did right here and are then perplexed when people who actually know something about the way the EU functions aren’t willing to just take your word for it? Because here are the actual facts: the EU is actually extraordinarily concerned with securing democratic legitimation for its processes, has gone out of its way to introduce mechanisms that enable it, is continuing to work to strengthen and multiply them and is generally primarily inhibited in its efforts by nationalists. A closer integration of the EU can absolutely be achieved in a way that respects national sovereignty and self-governance is not incompatible with cooperation, but rather the latter enhances the former and makes it more effective. And noting *those* facts is the end of the debate.

Which mean that it only makes sense to cover popular/mainstream opinions, otherwise someone can be offended/don't get it? Essentially giving the viewer what he wants to hear, not ""the truth"", they don't have any incentive to tell them ""the truth"" whatever it is. That has much bigger effect on channel's bias than price.
Good score with government officials and/or businesses, as they're providing a lot of content, exclusives etc? Which means they need to choose very carefully what can they say about them.

these are the issues/challenges the journalism in the West has been dealing with since... ever. In this some basic questions/prepositions have been developed, such as:

1) Who owns the media organization?
2.) Who controls it &amp; how?
3.) Sources of revenue? (ads? subscription? both? subsidies? government?)
3.) Barriers between marketing &amp; editorial processes?
...

As a consequence, you have a whole spectrum of media types, from journalists-owned non-profit organizations, to european public services... to corporate media... and state media. 

RT is a state media. The worst answer to the challanges of journalism.

Le orge non sono affatto la normalità per la grande maggioranza dei gay; solo chi frequenta certi ristretti circoli si trova a partecipare a questo genere di cose e parliamo di una piccola minoranza di persone.

&gt; In pratica secondo i loro racconti il gay tipico non va troppo per il sottile, non seleziona molto, basta un colpo d'occhio e due minuti dopo abborda un ciccione peloso che spompinerà nel cesso.

Sicuramente ci sono gay nella ""party scene"" che si comportano in modo decisamente liberale con qualcuno che gli piace (inclusi i pompini al cesso, per i quali va famoso un certo locale) ma di nuovo, questo è un piccolo numero di persone di cui si parla molto, non è la normalità.

E' già più normale, invece, che un gay (sopratutto se relativamente giovane) sia presente su un sacco di community di dating (Grindr prima fra tutte) e interagisca abbastanza spesso con altre persone a scopo di appuntamento o anche sesso occasionale. E' anche comprensibile: al di fuori dei locali gay è molto difficile e pure pericoloso per un gay approcciare qualcuno, quindi da quando la tecnologia lo permette queste communities sono esplose.

Sul non andare molto per il sottile in quanto a scelta dei partner non sono d'accordo: i gay sono pignoli quanto chiunque altro su cosa preferiscono e cosa gli piace. E' chiaro poi che, come per quasi tutti, se gli si presenta qualcuno che non è perfetto ma è più che sufficiente e ci sta, beh, una scopata non si nega a nessuno.

The bureaucrats can determine the minimum accepted price for an asset, but the market determines the real value. As long as nobody wants to buy an asset, it has no practical value.

It's impossible to do it right when the country transitions from a planned economy to a market economy. The know-how is not there.

Rhetorical flourish.

&gt; Which was exactly the initial point: most young Europeans speak perfectly fine English and the language barrier is dissolving.

Which I agreed with. But that means you have to agree the fact it has never been a division for the British and Americans is of some significance, even if it is dwindling.

&gt; Could that have something to do with the fact that “your sort” fail to bring any actual arguments to the table and instead just make unsubstantiated statements just like you did right here and are then perplexed when people who actually know something about the way the EU functions aren’t willing to just take your word for it? Because here are the actual facts: the EU is actually extraordinarily concerned with securing democratic legitimation for its processes, has gone out of its way to introduce mechanisms that enable it, is continuing to work to strengthen and multiply them and is generally primarily inhibited in its efforts by nationalists. A closer integration of the EU can absolutely be achieved in a way that respects national sovereignty and self-governance is not incompatible with cooperation, but rather the latter enhances the former and makes it more effective. And noting those facts is the end of the debate.

I am on the fence as regards the EU question, but your entire argument is undone by three words: ""ever closer union"". The power the EU has is taken from the national governments in exactly the same sense that the powers that Westminster has are powers that local (or in the case of the UK, national) governments cannot have. It is a simple matter of centralisation. If, for instance, Brussels sets regulations on the financial sector, unless Westminster negotiates an opt-out (always a fraught experience) then Westminster no longer has the power to supersede those regulations.

Everything she tried to pin on us was waived, and also her estimates were grossly inflated because all the local contractors are on holiday. We are understandably upset that she tried to stick us with the results of poor craftsmanship and an inflated estimate.

My grandparents live in a mixed community (gypsies arent immediate neighbours, but they are not far of). They don't dislike gypsies. They don't shy away from throwing stereotypes around, but there is no blanket dislike for gypsies. Hell, they even lived in a room rented from gypsies when they first moved to the city, and my grandpa has hired gypsies as day labourers when he needed the extra pair of hand without giving it a second thought. As an architect, he also regularly designed houses for gypsies (no, not the flabuoyant kind, but regular houses) and contrary to what you might expect, he didn't get screwed over.

Also I have a coworker who lives in what is essentially the Gypsy neighbourhood of my hometown. When asked, he said he lived there all his life never had any trouble with them.

What do you mean they are not there by choice? Do you mean they were kidnapped and forced to beg? Or do you mean that because of the discrimination they suffer they have to beg?

A few years back we met two different gypsies who made it into the EC traineeship program. What was interesting about these guys is that you wouldn't know they were of gypsy origins, until they told you so.

As we had the opportunity to talk to them, we asked them how they got the internship and one of them was from Romania and he said that indeed, he had the choice of following the same path as his family members, stealing, crime, whatever, or he could integrate. He decided he didn't want to be a criminal and he went to school, did well, etc.

He did say that in his own family though, he was mocked because he chose his current lifestyle. Quite surprising to us cause you would think the family would be glad he was leaving the old ways, but he said that no, it was difficult to leave the old lifestyle behind. The other guy didn't really go into details about his life, but he did tell us that yes, he was expected to be on the streets hustling.

What I would be curious to know is, how many of these roma actually continue their ""criminal life path"" because of family influence? It seemed to me that these 2 guys made  a difficult choice and it was something not quite welcomed in their group. But hell, 2 guys don't really represent the whole group, but my point is, I think that roma, if they wanted, they would integrate. These 2 guys did. 

And I think there was a BBC documentary where roma people in spain talk about this issue---they are expected to continue a life of crime and not really encouraged to go to school, etc. Been a while, but definitely, even though it might be more difficult for them to integrate. The choice is there,and many of them simply don't go that route. Unfortunately.",0,1377200730,null,0,false,0,cbt7txp,t3_1kva97,t1_cbt7txp,t1_cbt4415,null,1429736238,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Most restaurants are neither prepared to make vegan food nor gluten free food. Expect lots of salads and oven roasted veggies. You can always try. They likely won't hate you for it, they're just not very good at it :)

German cuisine involves a lot of animal products and a lot of gluten. It's unfortunate that the mainstream veg\*n options that other people don't notice are basically things like pasta that will generally contain gluten. I'd look for Asian restaurants, since Asian cuisine tends to involve less wheat and is also often more vegetarian-friendly, e.g. many Indian restaurants will have *some* vegetarian dish based on rice, legumes and vegetables where the only non-vegan ingredient is ghee (and they'll probably try to make something without it for you if you ask). 

Some bigger cities have both vegan restaurants and vegan supermarkets. Berlin is especially good for vegans with many 100% vegan restaurants. You will also find vegan supermarkets in Frankfurt/Main and Hamburg and (even) smaller vegan stores in some of the other large cities, such as Cologne or Munich. There are vegetarian restaurants in many mid size cities and vegan restaurants in some. 

If you're not going to eat exclusively at restaurants, stores are a different story. Organic (""bio"") and ""Reform"" stores tend to have a good selection of gluten free products (including brands that specialize on allergen free products) as well as products that vegans are more likely to buy (such as tofu, tempeh, fake cheese etc.; unfortunately the fake meats *usually* contain gluten). There also are Asian stores in most non tiny cities that might be useful. Normal supermarkets generally sell the vegan essentials such as soy milk, but often don't have a good selection of gluten free products. 

Most summer vegetables and fruit are also available in winter. What did you expect,  most of this stuff still grows somewhere else in Europe when it's winter in Germany.

There is no polite way to decline free food but coeliac disease is of course not unknown and medical reasons will always be accepted. As for veganism, I'm not having any trouble but I'm neither very social nor very submissive, so YMMV with loving hosts. :P

Hell no.. the general idea was 'well that's how gypsies are, no good trying to talk to them like normal people'. Some of their parents were violent, mostly towards their kids I would expect - was something done by the authorities? No.. beating your child is still ok in most parts, gypsy or not. I saw a lot of them drop out of school (were some were bullied - again, nothing done by the school). 

There were a lot of them begging in the city center - it doesn't bother me that much, I know they don't have any money, what are they going to eat? The right-wing policies conditioning basic aid on having a spotless record (no outstanding fines for whatever) puts them into this situation.

They harass you with washing your windows at the stoplight - of course it bothers me but saying no insistently works. Some people had stuff stolen (heck.. common sense will help one avoid this). 

One major problem is that they are not treated with basic respect, it's always 'the gypsy'. The ones I met are very polite when speaking to me, call me 'mister' and use the polite forms of language.
 
Arguably some of the rich gypsies don't show any respect to anyone either (this is extremely obvious when they drive) and once I did see two women with like 5 kids and the kids were spitting on passing cars while the women cheered.

I have met a lot of them, mostly abroad and I'd say 70% were decent people, just very poor and uneducated. 

Do I blanket hate them? NO.. there's some bad apples out there, even most gypsies say it.

Besides that there are also some who were tricked or others who are raised from childhood to be beggars. If you've seen the movie Slumdog Millionaire that's how they operate. 

&gt;As we had the opportunity to talk to them, we asked them how they got the internship and one of them was from Romania and he said that indeed, he had the choice of following the same path as his family members, stealing, crime, whatever, or he could integrate. He decided he didn't want to be a criminal and he went to school, did well, etc.

You make it seem like it's a choice when for most it's not. You never had to live the kind of life those guys or the millions of Roma in Europe had to. You don't understand what it's like to not be accepted based on the colour of your skin so naturally you oversimplify things and make it seem easy. ""All the poor have to do is stop being poor!"" If you could just wish something away the world would be a very different place. 

&gt;He did say that in his own family though, he was mocked because he chose his current lifestyle. Quite surprising to us cause you would think the family would be glad he was leaving the old ways, but he said that no, it was difficult to leave the old lifestyle behind. The other guy didn't really go into details about his life, but he did tell us that yes, he was expected to be on the streets hustling.

It was probably seen as a betrayal. Discrimination against the Roma has been constant and ongoing for as long as the Roma have been in Europe. This has isolated the Roma community into tightly knit family units where each family member is supposed to do their part in supporting the group. I'm not surprised he was shunned.

&gt;What I would be curious to know is, how many of these roma actually continue their ""criminal life path"" because of family influence? It seemed to me that these 2 guys made a difficult choice and it was something not quite welcomed in their group. But hell, 2 guys don't really represent the whole group, but my point is, I think that roma, if they wanted, they would integrate. These 2 guys did. 

How many people have gone from dirt poor to filthy rich in the past hundred years? Those who manage to beat the system are the exception, not the rule. Until the systemic discrimination is dealt with and Romas are given a fair chance in life they will remain in the state they are right now. The fact that most people don't understand the situation doesn't help either. 

&gt;And I think there was a BBC documentary where roma people in spain talk about this issue---they are expected to continue a life of crime and not really encouraged to go to school, etc. Been a while, but definitely, even though it might be more difficult for them to integrate. The choice is there,and many of them simply don't go that route. Unfortunately.

true,Djmedic,null,null,"&gt; In a federation, no state shares the same views. You're pretty naive to think so. Lets look at USA[which we all like to compare the EU to]. States have different laws, different tax rates and so on.

Some people like to compare the EU to the US because they have a political agenda to sell, I like them doing so, because you can easily squash it by pointing out the US were constructed by people who shared a common objective. They formed a nation, Americans are one people, which is not the case for Europeans. Finns are not Spaniards, Danes are not Italians.

&gt; Yes, it would solve the goddamn problems. The problems were caused in the first place by the EP not having enough power to legislate required laws

No it would not. 85% of French MEPs were against the introduction of animal protein to feed fishes with. However, 72% of the European Parliament voted in favor. So if the French now have to eat fishes fed this way, it's because deputies representing other countries decided so. How is that democratic again ?

&gt; What catastrophic effects of the Euro? The current crisis were not caused by the euro. It was caused by reckless overspending and overborrowing.

It's precisely caused by the euro because it pulverized the exchange rate system between currencies. When a nation developed trade deficits, its currency would automatically be devalued on the markets; this process occurred naturally and painlessly. 

Instead of this system, we have the European System of Central Banks, where the Central Banks still exist, they all emit euros, **and** :

* euros emitted by Germany are claims on the Bundesbank;
* euros emitted by Italy are claims on the Bank of Italy;
* euros emitted by Greece are claims on the Bank of Greece;
* etc.

Which means the the euro is not a *single* currency, it's a *common* currency. The Germans know this very well: when West Germany and East Germany reunited, they called the deustche mark *die einheitliche währung* (the single currency, for one people). When speaking of the euro, they call it *die gemeinsame währung*, the common currency.

More importantly, governments have sworn to **forever** uphold a convertibility of 1:1 of the euro between different countries.

Implying economies would develop at the same rhythm...which of course they do not. The Target2 system, which replaced the exchange-rate system, along with the interdiction of restricting movements of capital, no longer prevents banks from a cascade of ""rotten"" currencies. This is one of the reason the [Bundesbank's balance sheet blew up to 750 billion of euros of claims on various rotten Central Banks](http://www.creditwritedowns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Target2-Net-Balance.gif).

The other is: if you're a Greek/Spanish/Italian/Portuguese millionaire, what are you going to do if you think the euro is going to explode ? Close your bank account in said country, open one in Germany and transfer your fortune in order to have German euros.

Why ? The same reason interest rates on bonds emitted by Italy are astronomically high: when, not if, the euro explodes, you'll have claims on the Bundesbank instead, who will have to supply you in DM which will gain +30% currency, instead of having Greek drachmas or Italian Lire, those will lose between 30 and 50% of their value. People who are naive as you said, actually know all this and are currently attacking the peg of the euro between countries.

And you know what ? In the history of mankind, ALL pegs who were attacked, yielded, and all supranational currencies have disappeared. Because a currency represents a nation.


&gt; In a federation, no state shares the same views. You're pretty naive to think so. Lets look at USA[which we all like to compare the EU to]. States have different laws, different tax rates and so on.
I guess you are from the UK. Do you think that in the UK, all countries have similar economies? Do you think that Wales or Scotland is comparable to England? No. That ""argument"" is moot.

If it were moot, the Germans would have bailed out ~~the Greeks~~ Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan without a flinch of an eye. 


Robert Mundell's work on Optimal Currency Areas explain that history showed us there are only 3 ways to solve a state affected by an asymmetric shock:

* population movement from affected areas to non-affected areas, assuming affected populations want to move and that they would be welcomed,

* Tax and salary harmonization

* Financial transfers

Harmonization won't happen since some states joined the EU precisely because doing so would allow them to have a competitive advantage thanks to the difference in taxes and salaries.

Population movement doesn't occur in the EU, crisis-affected Portuguese emigrated to Angola, not Germany.
Smooth financial transfers can occur only if you have ties between people, which you don't have between European nations, since whether we like it or not, ties are made from centuries and centuries of history.
Transfers within East and West Germany occurred without issues, since it's one nation. 

Germans don't feel they're Greeks and vice-versa. The problem is, he who pays, decides. And we're basically asking Greeks to become Germans, who don't want and can't do so, just as Italians can't become Finns, or Spaniards can't become Dutch.

The euro will not survive because the EU is not an Optimal Currency Area, smart people know this, Nobels in Economy haven't stopped saying since the beginning of the euro, the designers of the euro knew it.

&gt; EU Federation is not the US's interests. I don't think that the US wants a powerful federation at the moment, when it has been revealed that they spy on us.

The US have been are the first proponent of a European federation and saving the euro:

true,fuchsiamatter,EURO,European Union,"Ok, so like I said I was going to bow out of this debate, but here goes anyway:

&gt; your entire argument is undone by three words: ""ever closer union"". The power the EU has is taken from the national governments in exactly the same sense that the powers that Westminster has are powers that local (or in the case of the UK, national) governments cannot have.

Except that that’s not how the EU works in practice. I realise that it’s usually presented – both by the press and national politicians – as an incomprehensible and alien entity that swoops in to legislate in the total absence of national input, but, that’s not how it works at all. It’s a bit of a vicious circle in that the complicated that technocratic nature of EU law-making procedures that are the way they are precisely in order to guarantee the sufficient involvement of national representatives on a variety of levels makes it hard for citizens to follow, reinforcing the perception of the EU as an inscrutable and meddlesome superpower.

To take an example, in order for a directive, the primary vehicle for European law-making, to be adopted, a complex co-decision process between the European Parliament, which is composed of direct representatives of the European people, and the Council, which consists of the relevant ministers of the governments of the Member States has to be followed. In this way, democratic legitimacy is achieved on a double level, while the national governments are directly involved in the legislative process. Moreover, in votes concerning sensitive topics - like security, external affairs or taxation - decisions by the Council have to be unanimous, which means that one single country can veto a decision alone. From 2014 a system known as 'double majority voting' will be introduced (as an example of that continuing work for greater democratic legitimacy I mentioned above), which will mean that for a proposal to go through, it will need the support of 2 types of majority: a majority of countries (at least 15) and a majority of the total EU population (the countries in favour must represent at least 65% of the EU population). As a result of all of this, in particular countries with the level of influence of the UK have very little to fear. To the contrary what this fosters is close cross-border cooperation that permits national governments the power to better manoeuvre themselves in an increasingly globalised world into favourable positions that allow them to achieve the results that are most to the advantage of their citizens. The alternative is giving up on occupying a place on the driving seat of Europe and locking ourselves on the outside, captives of the decisions of others that will inevitably, because of the realities of global politics, influence us without having afforded us a say in forming them. This kinda works for Norway or Switzerland, which are somewhat sui generis cases for reasons I won’t go into right now, but for a country whose economy is as industry and services based as the UK this would be a phenomenally bad move.

There is no “Brussels” that unilaterally sets regulations on the financial or any other sector. Westminster gives its personal stamp of approval to almost everything that passes and then – like the national governments are wont to do – lays the blame on the EU. And the reason it gave the seal of approval is because it knows that compromise with allies is necessary – even if Britain was outside the EU, such agreements would still have to be drafted on a unilateral basis, except that it would be more time-consuming, expensive and harder for Britain to influence the proceedings and form alliances on the inside with likeminded Member States, so to defend its interests. The power to completely disregard the will of other countries that you are imagining is a mirage.

And I want to make clear that the only reason I think the UK should detach itself a bit from the US is not because I dislike Americans or anything (I don’t), but exactly that: the US actually does have the power to do what it likes with no regard to the opinion of other countries. This will inevitably only be a temporary condition and like all previous superpowers the US will eventually start falling, but in the meantime it makes no sense for the UK to pretend to have the kind of power it simply does not have – particularly by making ourselves dependent on a state that has no geopolitical reason to treat us as the equals we are not.

I searched for it and it was clear that all i need to know is that i have to use a OLE which is generated by a file. 

It was tricky because it was a bullet list with a frame and i wanted maintain the ratio. So i had to do it two times because i fucked it up somehow (pushed the wrong arrow and the ratio was wrong).

I think for a training it wouldn't make a difference. Because you need to know:

 * How the option is called in LO or MSO.
 * Where the option is ""hidden"" in menu or ribbons.

And that's it for both software packages.

The ratio thing is a known problem, there is a plan to add an keep ratio option. Or there might be an option already i have not found.

Edit: We all know there are some important areas were LO lacks of features (as MSO), but the great thing about Open Source is  that you can pay a developer to write the function you need. That does not apply to MSO. If you need a feature that MSO does not like you don't get it. With Open Source you can develop it (or pay someone to do it). That is the strategic advantage why governments should use open source. You don't know what Microsoft will do with Office. 2020 there may be only a cloud version of MSO and as a government or corporation you don't want that (economic espionage etc.).

true,petshaver,LITH,Lithuania,"&gt; But never in that reply did i saw that any of those points are caused by the video we're discussing. It's like you just have some thoughts about RT, but the video doesn't prove any of your points.

That's right, we're having quite broad discussion about RT here. I was the one to point to the censorship issue which actually *was* what the reporter spoke about. And on my second reply I elaborated more on this issue, as I believed you were asking me to.

&gt; Additionally you're from Lithuania, so together with my previous point it leads me into believing that you're biased against Russia, would that be reasonable?

No, such assumption would be incorrect. It would be far from truth to call me admirer of Mr Putin's policies though. Currently there are no strong opposition figures in Russia for a proper comparison, but would you say that e.g. Garry Kasparov is biased against Russia? I hold similar views on many things, in a sense that I admire governments that are able to secure human rights, the rule of law, democratic elections and transfer of power, also division of powers besides other important things. I could go on, but that's a very wide topic. And I assure you that I would be extremely happy to see more of these qualities in Russia. If you want to call it pro-Western ideological bias, so be it, but that doesn't make me dislike Russia as a country or to dislike its people. I just happen to disagree with current Russian politics quite often.

&gt; It's not like Kremlins is telling them directly what exactly to do and to say. (...) It just isn't working that way, it's very easy to raise straight to the status of opposition supestart if you'll expose any of those ""direct orders"" from Kremlin.

I agree. I also think that there are no 'direct orders' on every piece of content they make, nor did I make such assumptions. That would be too tedious of a task for politicians and bureaucrats. But I do believe that people who are responsible for producing content for the network are following certain guidelines. Don't ask me for proof, I make such assumptions based on my personal opinion about selection of the content that I see on RT, and by drawing comparisons with other international media from other parts of the world. If you hold a different view, so be it, you have every right to do so.

I assure you that I have read your entire reply very attentively. I replied to statements I found most important to answer, else my wall of text would just be too long to read.

Well, maybe because people think you imply that mainland European TV is bad (which is pretty much true for entertainment in TV).

Or because people think you forgot that there is Britain and its glorious TV productions.

When i was a kid an older friend of mine who does couple therapy told me that communication is hard. Because the message is not the content and what you intended to say, but it is how the recipient receives the message. 

And with text on the internet communication is even harder because you do not have intonation, facial expression etc.

And that's why sometimes Americans read constructive critic by Europeans as anti-Americanism and why Europeans sometimes read ""American arrogance"" when there is no.

No, he was the exact opposite.

We are no longer under threat of becoming a police state, *we are already living in one*. An (almost) *global* one. Secret services are no longer spying on foreign countries; they are first and foremost spying on their own citizens, and sharing data about those citizens with other nations' secret services. It's now an entirely global problem. No wonder Snowden had to take refuge in an ""enemy"" state: only there is he safe (hopefully, and for now) from this global secret service conglomerate that we've allowed them to build.

Around 1940, the Nazis found themselves in a position where they could help themselves to the information so diligently stored by the Dutch about who was Jewish and who was not. The Dutch didn't mean any harm by storing that info (who would ever abuse *that*? Heck, the British *still* regularly ask you for your religion and ethnicity), but it was *so* bloody useful to those invading troops.

Don't ever think that the data stored about you won't harm you; don't ever think ""but I have nothing to hide!"".

true,JimmyNic,ENGL,England,"&gt; Except that that’s not how the EU works in practice. I realise that it’s usually presented – both by the press and national politicians – as an incomprehensible and alien entity that swoops in to legislate in the total absence of national input, but, that’s not how it works at all. It’s a bit of a vicious circle in that the complicated that technocratic nature of EU law-making procedures that are the way they are precisely in order to guarantee the sufficient involvement of national representatives on a variety of levels makes it hard for citizens to follow, reinforcing the perception of the EU as an inscrutable and meddlesome superpower.

Aww, poor citizens, unable to understand that what we are doing is really for your benefit. Here, have a biscuit and a pat on the head.

&gt; To take an example, in order for a directive, the primary vehicle for European law-making, to be adopted, a complex co-decision process between the European Parliament, which is composed of direct representatives of the European people, and the Council, which consists of the relevant ministers of the governments of the Member States has to be followed. In this way, democratic legitimacy is achieved on a double level, while the national governments are directly involved in the legislative process. Moreover, in votes concerning sensitive topics - like security, external affairs or taxation - decisions by the Council have to be unanimous, which means that one single country can veto a decision alone.

As you will well know, the last time Cameron used a veto the decision went ahead anyway, merely with Britain excluded. Which rather undermines the ""democratic legitimacy"" you imagine.

&gt; The alternative is giving up on occupying a place on the driving seat of Europe and locking ourselves on the outside, captives of the decisions of others that will inevitably, because of the realities of global politics, influence us without having afforded us a say in forming them. This kinda works for Norway or Switzerland, which are somewhat sui generis cases for reasons I won’t go into right now, but for a country whose economy is as industry and services based as the UK this would be a phenomenally bad move.

What driving seat? The UK has for some time had a reputation for being uncooperative and has accrued some deserved resentment amongst the rest of the EU. The UK doesn't have an appetite for the big initiatives that the Single Market favours, which makes it rare on a continent which mostly approves of the EU and wants more of it. We also quite simply don't have a very large number of nationals inside many of the EU institutions, at least in proportion to our size as a country. 

There is also a pretty good chance the EU will carve up the financial sector within the next few years, as the EU's more socialistic core do not wish to treat Britain's financial sector with the reverence they have shown France's farming industry. So I don't really buy that side of your argument.

I never said I thought it'd be easy if we left the EU, and there are plenty of problems with leaving which will have to be addressed. But I think it's bad form to pretend the EU isn't moving towards a federal model, and also that it isn't in many ways already a state, a pretence which has contributed to the disengagement of the average Brit who has far less interest in European elections than they should.

BTW, that we don't have a local Roma population anymore has to do with the fact that our grandparents killed them all. We stopped having any experience with Roma for 50 odd years because of that so maybe we should be careful how we approach this topic?

Why transition to an inferior (as in: not having the same features) specification? What Microsoft cunningly did with standardizing OOXML was remove the ""don't use proprietary formats"" argument that governments were using: OOXML is also a [standard](http://xkcd.com/927/) :)

Not to mention that most governmental publications still come in .doc (MSO2003 or XP).

""Standards"" are not an absolute good. The reason HTML got non-standard elements (e.g. BLINK, MARQUEE) and scripting technologies is that standards moved too slow.

If the right regulations are in place, and if they're enforced, especially when the geological locale means that contamination beyond faulty wells going in place is negligible, and even extremely unlikely if there is a fault - as there are independent scientific studies that have shown - then it's only windmill subsidy lobbyists and holders of other gas licenses that can really complain.
