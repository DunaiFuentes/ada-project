There was very little between Edinburgh and Paris for me. But I just prefer the big knights in iron armour feel of Edinburgh to Paris's super polished fashion capital style. I think if I was to be more objective and less subjective, then Paris would come first because it is loser to what our classical ideas of beauty are, but for me, it just feels like the wrong kind of beauty. 

I think Amsterdam is above Rome and Athens for similar reasons. Amsterdam is more unique in more opinion. Obviously they're all very unique, but I think Rome, Paris, Madrid, Lisbon, Athens and all the other Romance countries capitals are a lot more similar than North European capitals in their style. For example, there is less difference between Athens and Rome than there is between Edinburgh and Amsterdam.

So really what I'm doing here is combing two lists. One list is about more traditional ideas of beauty. That's the list with Athens, Paris and Rome. And then there's the other list which is a lot less about being polished and more about being industrious but in a stylish and cool way.

Bellissimi ricordi. L'ultima moto che ho avuto e' stata la X-Eleven (Honda)...fantastica, anche se purtroppo in Italia non se ne sono viste tante.

Andavo fuori quasi tutte le domeniche con il solito gruppo di motociclisti! Dalle Marche (Falconara) andavamo spesso verso l'umbria o la toscana.

Ogni anno facevamo i tipici raduni, dal primo raduno dell'anno a Gennaio in montagna alle varie sagre di paese (sagra del tartufo..la mia preferita), con raduno motociclistico annesso.

Potremmo stare a parlare per ore della bellezza di girare in moto per paesini, strade di montagna e citta'. Lo spirito di gruppo, le intemperie, le soste...tutto fa parte di quel fantastico mondo!!!

Quando mi sono trasferito in US ho venduto la moto ed ora vado solo con le 4 ruote...voglio pensarla come una pausa...magari lunga, ma sempre una pausa.

**Nürnberg:**
Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.

* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.

* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (in the weeks before christmas)

* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.

* [Felsengänge Nürnberg](http://www.felsengaenge-nuernberg.de/en/our-organisation.html) (They forgot to translate the text on the frontpage, but the rest should be fine) are tunnels and bunkers, storages etc. under the whole city. Some are from the 14th century and were used as storages to keep the beer cool. During WWII, many of them under the old city centre and the castle got connected and were used as bunkers and there were plans to install factories there, too. There were a ton of art stored in these bunkers during WWII. There is also an Bunker under the train station from the cold war era. One of my special recommendations!

* In the [Handwerkerhof](http://www.handwerkerhof.de/en/home.html) you can see how craftsmen create tradtitional products from the area in an medivial environment.

* Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe, you can visit his house and see some of his art in the 

* [Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp;amp; culture. It's very interesting, you can see there works from great german artists, but also medivial weapons &amp;amp; armors, other technical stuff, etc.

* [Neues Museum Nürnberg](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neues_Museum_N%C3%BCrnberg) has a great collection of modern and contemporary art and design, for example Andy Warhol.

* [Peter Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henlein), one of the first people who built pocketwatches 

* [Lebkuchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebkuchen) is also a franconian/nuremburg thing

* In the time before christmas: Christkildemarkt + Glühwein!

* Nürnberg has a soccer team and a icehockey team in the highest german leagues, also.

* ADIDAS and PUMA have their headquarters and big outlet shopping centres in the small town of Herzogenaurach, 25km north-west of Nuremberg. If you want to go shopping for cheap sportswear (and more), you should consider a visit. Also if you are interested in [modern](http://www.vb.com/puma/puma-hq-herzogenaurach-m.jpg) [architecture](http://www.herzogenaurach.de/typo3temp/pics/e9cc906d7d.jpg).

**Bamberg:**

* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique euopean medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  

* The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.

* Right next to the Cathedral, there is the [""Alte Hofhaltung""](http://www.emiksch.de/Lions/2007/Bilder/slides/Bamberg_Alte_Hofhaltung.jpg) where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers (from 2011, with orlando bloom etc.)

* The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""

* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above

* You get the best [view over the whole city](http://home.arcor.de/pahaschi/Bamberg/Blick_auf_Bamberg.jpg) from the terraces of [Michelsberg Abbey](http://www.travelwriter.at/pic/049/bamberg-kloster-michaelsberg-020331g.jpg) (Kolster Michelsberg), and former Abbey, where you find a nice restaurant/cafe today. There is also the [franconian brewery museum](http://www.brauereimuseum.de/) there.

* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006. He was leading the plot to kill Hitler.

* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;num=1&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18) as you'll have a [superb view over Bamberg](http://www.spezial-keller.de/index_files/stacks_image_44.jpg) and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)  If you want to do it local style, bring your own food and only buy the beer there. **I would not recommend this in the winter, quite cold outside**
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food like Bratwurst, Schäuferla (my recommendation, try it at least once!!!) or Schweinebraten.

* Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;amp;num=30&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=de&amp;amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=17), or the [Spezi Rauchbier](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.896912,10.893111&amp;amp;spn=0.001994,0.005284&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;hq=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;radius=15000&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18). Right there you will also find the Fässla, where you can enjoy some great beer too.
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right you can enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg. You will find there many US citizens, as Bamberg has the Warner Barracks with over 3000 soldiers.

* Bamberg has a Baskteball team in the highest german league.  It's the dominating team of the last years and also playing in the european league. 

* Bamberg is a University Town with currently about 12k Students (at 70k people), so you'll find young people everywhere.

Also, on your trip from Nuremberg to Bamberg, you will pass Buttenheim, the birthplace of **[Levi Strauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss)**, inventor of the famous [LEVI Jeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Levi%27s_506_back_pocket.jpg) where you can visit a museum. There are also two good breweries where you can eat really good too. I would recommend ""Schäuferla"" :)

**Würzburg:**

* [Würzburger Residenz](http://www.grand-i-tour.de/de/images/git_wuerzburgresi13.jpg) Also some scenes from the three musketeers were shot here

* [Feste Marienburg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Festung-Marienberg_1409_10_11.jpg)
Würzburg is in the centre of [franconian wine region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia_%28wine_region%29), which is known for its [Bocksbeutel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bocksbeutel.jpg)

* Würzburg has a Basketball team in the highest german league.

* The University of Würzburg has about 25k students enrolled, the city if full of them ;)

**Bayreuth:** 

* [The Opara House is Unesco world heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margravial_Opera_House)(also change to german version to see the asonishing inside of the opera house) and it's the city of Wagner (Ride of the Valkyries)

* [The Eremitage](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitage_%28Bayreuth%29) wiki only in german, but the pictures are what you are going to see

* Bayreuth has a Basketball team in the highest german league. As you see, franconia is quite strong in german basketball with 3 teams.

**Franconian Switzerland / Little Switzerland**
Also, franconia is relatively cheap to live (0,5 litre of beer: beginning at 1,50€), and the [franconian switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconian_Switzerland) is one of the oldest touristic regions in germany. It's famous for its beer, its bakeries and 
butchers. It is also called land of the castles sometimes, as there are very many of them. 
You can discover it best by car, but there are is a list of [bus lines](http://vgn.de/freizeitlinien/) (german link) that are esp. for recreational/free time destinations like wildlife parks or hiking from may 1st till november. Click ""herunterladen (PDF)"" to download a pdf with a map and images to see what to expect and maybe use google translate (google translate did not work on the homepage when I tried it, so i recommend the pdf ""workaround""). Here is a [map of the region with public transport lines](http://www.vgn.de/ib/site/documents/media/f387bb36-6624-65dd-c17b-5cde6c7b84f4.jpg/VG_Freizeit_Prospekt.jpg) that are interesting for tourists, green are regular routes, purple routes are weekend and holiday only and only in the summer while orange are weekend only during the whole year. If you need help to find the right trip, message me and I'll translate and help you to find the busses etc.

* [Aufseß](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufse%C3%9F) is the village with the highest density of breweries in the world, there are 4 breweries for only 1351 people.
Also the founder of the german national museum in Nuremberg, Hans von und zu Aufseß, Knight of the Empire and his family had (and still have) their castle (well, actually two castles) there and live there. 

* [Sanspareil](http://www.bayreuth-wilhelmine.de/bilder/sanspareil/felsentheater480.jpg) is a Park created by Wilhelmine von Bayreuth, the sister of Frederick the great. You'll find the [Morgenländischer Bau](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanspareil_-_Morgenl%C3%A4ndischer_Bau.jpg) there and the [castle of the village](http://www.wonsees.de/geschichte/Sanspareil850J/Bilder/Burg_Zwernitz.jpg) is nice, too.

* The Wiesenttal (Valley of the river Wiesent) is very nice too, you'll find some [ruins of castles](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Burgruine_Neideck_05112008.JPG) and scenic rocks there, and it's right next to the autobahn from Nuremberg to Bamberg.

* At the entrance to the Wiesenttal you'll find the [Walberla](http://www.walberla.de/uploads/images/walberla-niedlingi.jpg) (or Ehrenbürg) hill, which is one of the most important hills in the area. First settlements on the hill date back till the stone age, and you can still see remains of the wall which surrounded the whole plateau from about 500 B.C.


**Traditional Food** you can expect in the region:
Aside from the famous [Nürnberger](http://www.nuernberger-bratwuerste.de/images/bilder/Gerichte_Feuer/46Bratwurst_20110812_437_kleiner_6%20mit%20Kraut.jpg), you should try [Fränkisches Schäuferla](http://www.frankenalb.de/uploads/pics/schaeufele_008_01.jpg) or [Saure Zipfel](http://www.antenne.de/cf/services/img/ccadd//470xx/4112797.jpg). [Spargel](http://www.spargel.net/images/spargel-mit-schinken.jpg) is also very common here. [Fränkischer Sauerbraten](http://autoimg.kochbar.de/kbrezept/45625_17700/400x266/rezept-sauerbraten-mit-lebkuchensosse-bild-nr-7.jpg) is a speciality, as there is gingerbread in the sauce. [Krenfleisch](http://www.genussregion.oberfranken.de/images_gen/spezialitaeten_bilder/716_big.jpg) has a sauce of horseradish. As side dishes, [Wirsing / Savoy cabbage](http://www.das-sonnenkorn.de/assets/images/wirsing.jpg), [Sauerkraut](http://www.marions-kochbuch.de/rezept/0283.jpg) or [Blaukraut](http://www.kostenlose-rezepte.eu/upload/Blaukraut-657.jpg) are the way to go next to the mandatory Kloß / Knödel which are either [Kartoffelklöße/knödel](http://bavariaundercover.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/kloss.jpg) (made of potatoes) or [Semmelkloß/knödel](http://www.essen-und-trinken.de/uploads/thumbnails/0009/00000000009/1024x1024/FeineSemmelknoedel_4f5e90da3a46fd18d55c0d07f683cbba_fjt2009040391.jpg)(made of bread rolls). As a dessert, you should try [Knieküchle](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/K%C3%BCchla.JPG).

As drinks, try one of the [franconian white wines](http://www.bad-boys-on-tour.de/sommerhausen/bilder/bocksbeutel.jpg) in their characteristic bottles or one of the countless beers of the [region with the highest density of breweries in the world](http://www.franken-sind-keine-baiern.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Deutschland_Bier_Nebenkarte.jpg)

**Breweries I would recommend, although all are great:**

* Brauerei Wagner in Merkendorf
* Brauerei Goldener Löwe in Buttenheim (where the Levi Strauss museum is)
* Schlenkerla in Bamberg (The Rauchbier - that means Smoked beer- is a famous speciality, tastes like bacon) 
* Fässla in Bamberg
* Grasser in Huppendorf
* Klosterbrauerei in Weissenohe (founded 1050, one of the oldest breweries in germany, great food also!)

(Typical beer types in the region are ""helles"" and ""dunkles"", but also ""Märzen"" or ""Bockbier"") 

**Some Festivals in the Region:**

true,meidei,CYPR,Demilitarised Cyprus 2015 Special: isyan! devrim! özgürlük!,"The urban legend (stuff they teach you in primary school): When the country became independent (up to 1959 it was a British Crown Colony), the officials noticed literally at the last minute that they didn't have a flag (because up to now the flags of the Kingdom of Greece and the Turkish Republic they were used by the people, and the British flag by the government). So in a great hurry, they created the current flag just in time for the first ceremony. ""Someone at the presidential office drew it"".

The [actual story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Cyprus): There was a competition to create a neutral flag for the new country. The colours of Greece (blue) and Turkey (red) were out of limits, and so where religious symbolisms. The original design by  İsmet Güney, which was approved by the President and the Vice President was the outline of the map of Cyprus on a field of white and olive leaves at the bottom. Later revised to have an opaque map. White is of course the colour of peace, and the double olive leaves reinforced the idea/ideal of two communities living peacefully together. The sometimes gold and sometimes copper map is inspired from the metal copper, characteristic of Cyprus in the old times. 

Now, whether most people ever liked the flag and the complicated politics of its usage, they are probably out of scope here. ",0,1376414629,null,0,1376414839,0,cbmxz0h,t3_1kaepz,t1_cbmxz0h,t3_1kaepz,null,1429843433,15,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,15

Ma e' ovvio come la pensi.

Vabbe, ammetto, sono anche posti belli. Pero, simile alla famiglia omosessuale, la casa famiglia non fornisce una mamma e un papa. Allora qual'e la differenza? Perche pensi che le case famiglia sono superiori ai genitori gay?

Io ti dico perche io penso che i genitori gay siano superiori alla casa familgia.

1. Anche se hai 100 persone che fanno finta di essere i tuoi genitori possiamo discutere se veramente' mostrano il stesso affetto come i propri genitori o nel nostro caso, genitori adottivi.

2. Chi paga queste case famiglia? Forse l'italiano che paga le tasse? Non e' giusto. Se il detto bambino viene adottato di una coppia gay, il bimbo viene tolto dal sistema sociale e salvi soldi agli italiani. Ho ragione? Cosa succede al bambino di casa famiglia dopo il 18esimo anno? Chi paga l'universita'? Nessuno? O l'taliano? Un'altra che centra con l'economia. Visto che la coppia gay non si riproduce per le generazioni future mancano 2 persone( i gay pensionati). Due meno lavoratori scambiati di due poveri(i bimbi che non hanno avuto la famiglia e nemmeno un'educazione sufficiente), o peggio-criminali che sono cresciuti in una casa famiglia o in un orfanotrofio.

Flanders and Brussels, on the other hand, or both densely populated and urbanized. For every policy decision, Brussels Region has to coordinate with Flanders: roads? don't work if they don't continue into Flanders. Water treatment? Water doesn't stop at the border.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Are you that unfamiliar with Keynes? Can one possibly be? I'm not advocating massive infrastructure spending before a crisis, I'm advocating infrastructure spending TO GET OUT OF THE FUCKING CRISIS.

I'm very familiar with Keynes and Keynes doesn't work when you waste your money into project that don't produce anything, not to mention that infrastructure spending doesn't really distribute money widely, most of it goes to companies that produce materials, not to the few workers that are employed by it.

Any attempt to build new high speed rail-lines and wind power will cause the same effect that the Spanish spending programs did in 2008 and 2009 - make sure total bankruptcy. 

&gt; Also, Spain had no deficit and little debt before the crisis. Yet that's what we're made to believe is the panacea. Look at how great that worked out!
&gt; You know what made the Spanish economy tank? Banks that had to then be bailed out.

Spanish politicians via Cajas, local savings banks, pumped billions after billions to short sighted infrastructure projects and local ventures. It has been Cajas and Spanish regions that have needed bailing out. However look at Spanish commercial banks, they haven't needed any bailouts.

&gt; You know what's responsible for much of the public debt increase in France in the past few years? The bailing out of Crédit Agricole, Société Générale, BNP and Dexia. Hundreds of billions. And nothing to show for it.

Debt in France is growing because the French economy doesn't generate new growth, because it is strangled by high taxation, rigid labor legislation and entrepreneur hostile bureaucracy.

&gt; Now we're being told that financing clean energy is not possible by the ECB. Really?

First of all wind electricity is not clean, not even nearly. First of all huge amount of steel, concrete and other materials go to building of these plants, secondly due to huge load variations they cause electricity networks have to be hugely expanded and fast back up power build that there are hardly any benefits to the environment.

However supporting wind and solar power is actually a good way to hand out industrial subsidies to your ailing machine building and chemical processing industries. *cough* Germany *cough ... However if a country doesn't have these industries, then it is not just simply wasting good money, but burning good money away.

Not to mention of course that wind and solar energy are very expensive. For example currently it is approx 20% cheaper to run new energy intensive plants in US than it is in Germany, and that gap is widening every year for the benefit of US. Maybe Germans can deal with this, but other EU countries are ill suited to face it. Please take a look on energy [price statistics](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Energy_price_statistics), currently energy costs for industry are double in those countries that have invested heavily to renewable energy (Spain and Germany) than in countries that haven't (France, Sweden, Finland).

The only rational way produce clean energy is by allowing more nuclear plants to be build up. The good thing about nuclear is that it even doesn't need subsidies or financing from governments, it can be financed and build commercially.",0,1376416641,null,0,false,0,cbmyriw,t3_1k9i2o,t1_cbmyriw,t1_cbmxvqi,null,1429843063,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Although these countries were allies (most of the time), this gave rise to some embarrassing identification problems at sea. To solve this, the Spanish navy selected, from among several alternative designs, the one which proved most visible at sea, namely what ultimately became Spain's red-gold-red national flag. While it seems to have solved those identification problems, one can't avoid thinking that it mostly helped the marksmanship of enemy gunners, since the combat record of the once-mighty Spanish navy hasn't been particularly positive since adopting that high-viz ensign (see: Battle of Trafalgar, Battle of Manila, Battle of Santiago).

The blue, white and red colors were used here and there since Clovis to represent the kingdom of France and all, so when the Revolutionaries picked colors for themselves, they picked the colors which were previously used by the royal authorities, because they were the colors associated by all with the nation.

true,bonzinip,ITAL,Italy,"&gt; Is a union required for temp or part-time workers?

No.

&gt; Is there a minimum income requirement?

I don't know about immigrants. _EDIT_: about immigration law.

&gt; Is temporary or part-time work allowed?

Yes.

&gt; Is temporary or part-time work common?

Temporary work and freelance work is common, especially among younger people. Part-time work is not. Some employers use temporary work and especially freelance work because taxes are a bit lower (for temporary work, which can be fine) or entirely paid by the freelancer (which sucks).

&gt; What are the minimum and maximum allowed work hours per week?

Minimum, I don't know.  Maximum is 38.5, the contract may go above that but then the extra hours must be compensated by extra days off.

&gt; What are the taxes for employers and workers?

If your gross income is 100, the employer pays ~30 more, you pay something towards your retirement fund and income tax.  Income tax excludes the first ~7000 euros per year, then it grows from 28% to 43%.

Also, your employer takes some money from your paycheck but must give it back with interest when you change job, retire, or are laid off. Optionally you can divert this money from your employer to the retirement fund too.

&gt; Do you have a national minimum wage?

No, but most contracts are negotiated at the national level so effectively there is a minimum wage for jobs following such contracts (which excludes most temporary jobs, though not all).

&gt; What are some common job roles filled by temp and part-time workers?

No particular roles.

&gt; Are there common illegal work schemes?

Wage is paid cash every month, no retirement, no paid time off, no paid vacation, can be fired at any time.",0,1376421219,null,0,1376499229,0,cbn0lhy,t3_1kaama,t1_cbn0lhy,t3_1kaama,null,1429842177,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

They have built a house near Vilnius, and seem to be doing well by Lithuanian standards, but they said that, until they retire, they probably won't be returning to Lithuania.

Which seems strange to me, since they kinda have the worst of both worlds, as I see it.

It really does seem better to work for a few seasons or years in a Western European country, and then get to work building your life in Lithuania, Latvia, Serbia, etc. Taking examples from the best of where you were a guest, adapting and introducing it to your homeland.

&gt;Non ho nulla contro i preti.

&gt;*Ci mancherebbe altro, verrebbe da dire, ma passiamo oltre.*

&gt;Però, diciamocelo, un figlio prete non farebbe piacere neanche a te.

&gt;*Farebbe piacere? E in quale curioso modo, di grazia, la vocazione di mio figlio dovrebbe far piacere a me, o quella del tuo dovrebbe far piacere a te?*

&gt;Non dico questo, per carità, ognuno fa quello che vuole.

&gt;*E ci rimancherebbe altro, verrebbe da ridire, ma ripassiamo oltre.*

&gt;Però, sai com’è, avere un figlio prete sarebbe comunque un problema, se non altro perché gli altri lo discriminerebbero.

&gt;*Gli altri? Sicuro, che siano gli altri? Perché a me è parso che il primo a discriminare questo ipotetico figlio prete sei proprio tu: voglio dire, se tu per primo dici che non vorresti un figlio prete, come puoi prendertela con “gli altri” che dovessero discriminarlo?*

&gt;Eh, ma questo è il solito dilemma se è nato prima l’uovo o la gallina…

&gt;*E questo è il solito trucchetto per buttare tutto in vacca: qua tu sei sia uovo che gallina, amico mio, il che significa che come la metti la metti questa faccenda la stai muovendo anche tu.*

&gt;Ok, però ammetterai che insomma, come dire, se non fosse prete e si trovasse una ragazza sarebbe meglio.

&gt;*Non mi pare.*

&gt;Vorresti dirmi che per te sarebbe indifferente?

&gt;*Sì.*

&gt;Eh, bravo. Poi voglio vederti, quando ti capita.

&gt;*Mi capita? “Mi” capita? Cioè, mio figlio è prete e la cosa sta “capitando” a me? Mi pare che si tratti di una cosa che “capita” a lui, mica a me.*

&gt;Mah, contento tu… E poi, non so, anche la gioia di avere dei nipoti, tu ci rinunceresti così?

&gt;*No. Ma i nipoti si possono adottare.*

&gt;Ah no, guarda, io non ho niente contro i preti…

&gt;*(e due)*

&gt;…al limite, guarda che ti dico, mi andrebbe bene anche se si sposassero…

&gt;*A te “andrebbe bene”? Cioè, loro si sposano e la cosa deve andare bene a te?*

&gt;…ma all’adozione sono contrario.

&gt;*Ah sì? E perché?*

&gt;Guarda, io sono convinto che un bambino debba crescere con un uomo e una donna.

&gt;*Ah sì? E perché? (again)*

&gt;Ma come, perché. Non c’è un perché. Insomma, da che mondo è mondo è così, evidentemente dev’essere così.

&gt;*Tipo la miopia?*

&gt;La miopia?

&gt;*Eh sì, la miopia. Mica si correggeva ma miopia, una volta. Da che mondo era mondo, sottolineo. Solo che a un certo punto abbiamo cominciato a farlo. Mi stai dicendo che dovremmo rinunciare agli occhiali?*

&gt;Maddai, che c’entra, è una cosa diversa. Un bambino ha bisogno di entrambe le figure, sia quella maschile che quella femminile, ne va del suo sviluppo psicologico e affettivo.

&gt;*Ho capito. E se il padre muore, o se muore la madre?*

&gt;Be’, questa è una cosa diversa: quando le cose succedono, succedono.

&gt;*Ah, ecco. Allora, se non ti dispiace, riformuliamo: un bambino ha bisogno di entrambe le figure, sia quella maschile che quella femminile, a meno che non vada diversamente perché “succede”. E’ corretto?*

&gt;Sei il solito polemico, non ho detto questo.

&gt;*Sì che l’hai detto: anche perché, perdonami, non capisco come mai la sorte del bambino che non cresce con “entrambe le figure” ab origine ti stia così a cuore, mentre quella del bambino che cresce con un genitore solo a causa di un accidente no.*

&gt;Non è che non mi sta a cuore, è solo che in quel caso non ci si può fare niente…

&gt;*No? E chi l’ha detto? Si può dare in affidamento a un’altra famiglia, quel bambino.*

&gt;Sì, bravo. Ora si dà un bambino in affidamento solo perché è rimasto orfano di un genitore.

&gt;*Solo? Come sarebbe, “solo”? Non s’era detto che per un bambino è un fatto drammatico, non crescere con un uomo e una donna? Non s’era detto che “ne va del suo sviluppo psicologico e affettivo”? Non s’era detto che è un’eventualità così nefasta, spaventosa, terrificante da indurre addirittura a negare a un cospicuo numero di cittadini il diritto all’adozione? Be’, se è così…*

&gt;Guarda, non lo dicevo nel senso che intendi tu.

&gt;*Ah, ecco. E in che senso, esattamente?*

&gt;Oh, insomma, basta. A me avere un figlio prete non farebbe piacere. Punto. Sarò padrone di essere contento quando dico io, no?

&gt;*Padronissimo. Però, permetti un’osservazione?*

&gt;Sentiamo.

&gt;*Tu stai con una donna, vero?*

&gt;Certo, la conosci pure tu. E la pensa esattamente come me.

&gt;*Non ne dubito. Quindi ‘sto figlio ipotetico di cui stiamo parlando crescerebbe con un uomo e una donna, come dici tu.*

&gt;Evidentemente sì.

&gt;*Ottimo. Ma questo figlio ipotetico, nel caso fosse prete, che tipo di giovamento psicologico ed emotivo trarrebbe, rispetto all’ipotesi di crescere con un padre adottivo prete, dal fatto di essere cresciuto da un uomo e una donna a cui “non fa piacere” la sua vocazione?*

&gt;Be’…

They adopted the colors from the Freikorps for all troops because had to make them all equal, and the easiest thing to do that was to color everything in a dark color. The buttons were chosen as bronze/golden and red as markers. Schwarz-Rot-Gold


Later, people interpreted  it like that: black as the darkness of being ruled by Napoleon, red as the color of struggle/battle, and bronce/gold as the 'light of freedom'


Now the flag as a tri-colore didn't exist until the revolution of 1848. Both, monarchists and republicans chose the tricolor as their symbol. The republicans, in the spirit of the french revolution, chose it vertically. So changing sides was rather easy...


During the Norddeutscherbund (Merger with Prussia and subsequent Deutsches Reich) the flag was changed to the prussian black-white-red tri-colore.


After world war one, during the Weimarer Republik it was changed back to the schwarz-rot-gold of the 1848 revolution.


Then some fucktard decided to have the symbol of the nazi party as the national flag.


After WW2 it was obvious that anything related to the nazi regime is off limits. And for quite some time we didn't have a flag. Lots of debate about it and lots of designs were made. A vertical Schwarz-Rot-Gold symbolizing the spirit of the new German Republik was among them, as well as a scandinavian cross in Schwarz-Rot-Gold and a cut-in-half tricolore symbolizing east and westgermany.

true,HomSig,NETH,Nederland,"* Is a union required for temp or part-time workers?

No. However, it's the unions that negotiate with the employers' unions. They set a CAO (collective labour agreement) which is then enforced by the government (if it follows legal requirements). Not all sectors do this.

* Is there a minimum income requirement?

No.

* Is temporary or part-time work allowed?

* Is temporary or part-time work common?

Yes, and it's very common. About half the people work part-time. Partly because some people have multiple part-time jobs (ie high school teachers working at two schools), partly because it is just very popular. 

*What are the minimum and maximum allowed work hours per week?

I'm getting my information from [this](http://www.lbv.nl/veel-gestelde-vragen/106-hoeveel-mag-ik-werken) website. It applies to every adult (18+) with an employer.

At most 12 hours a day, and at most 60 hours a week. Over a period of four weeks, the average must be below 55 hours a week, unless a CAO states otherwise. In a period of 16 weeks, the average must be below 48 hours a week. 

You get a period of at least 11 hours free time after every working day. Once a week this may be shortened to 8 hours if it's necesarry for the job. 

After five days of work, there is a free time period for at least 36 hours. This may be ignored as long as every two weeks has a free time period of at least 72 hours, which may be split into two periods of at least 32 hours.

If you work for longer than five and a half hour, you get a break of at least 30 minutes. If you work longer than 10 hours, you get a break of at least 45 minutes. These breaks may be split in breaks of 15 minutes. This rule can be ignored by a collective agreement, as long as there's at least a 15 min break after five and a half hours of work. Breaks are not necesarrily paid (but often they are).

* What are the taxes for employers and workers?

They are the same for part-time workers as for full-time workers. As a result, two incomes of €30.000 a year both get into a lower bracket and result in a higher total than one income of €60.000 a year. This can partly explain the popularity of part-time working.

* Do you have a national minimum wage?

* What is the history of the labor laws?

* What is the societal opinion of the current laws?

Yes, there is a national minimum wage of about 1.480 a month for a full time job. It depends on the sector what exactly is considered a full time job. Usually it's 36, 38, or 40 hours a week.

There is a recent (since the last decade) trend that people start their own one-man company. They are then hired by employers who are not considered employers, dodging a lot of the previous mentioned laws. The older generations have a lot of rights, while the younger generations have very little.

The recent liberalisation of the postal market is a good example of the change. Before the liberalisation, mailmen made a wage that was enough to make a decent living, and the post services were reasonable trustworthy. After the liberalisation, the wages were made what we call ""marktconform"" (in line with the market): the directors' wages were raised to €475.000 a year with a bonus of at most 100% of that wage, and the mailmen were fired and re-hired as the one-man companies I mentioned earlier. Their wages are calculated per piece delivered rather than per hour, so mailmen barely make the minimum wage (in some cases even less, but it's legal since it are private one-man companies). This has decreased the reliability of the postal service, since post is being dumped rather than delivered when it rains. The mail delivery company has also cut on safety measures, which means criminals can now simply change your address and collect all your post without a notice.

There's quite a debate going on in the Netherlands about this trend. Right-wing parties like VVD, CDA, and D'66 as well as employers' unions claim the trend increases productivity (work done / €), and therefore contributes to our national wealth. Left-wing parties like PvdA, SP, and GL claim the trend decreases employee loyalty and decreases the incentives for employers to invest in their employees, and they claim the transition leads to less rights for employees, while increasing income inequality.

* Are there any upcoming law changes?

* What are some common job roles filled by temp and part-time workers?

* Are there common illegal work schemes?

I don't know. Law changes are often changed before the change takes effect. Most typical part-time jobs are probably typical female jobs, since about 3/4 of the women works part-time.

They aren't doing it the last 40 years, for most of the positions. They where doing it before the democracy. But, It was really bad before we protected the public servants. A change in the government could mean that thousands of employees would change specially in the police and the Tax Service.

But, Spain is not doing reforms and this is the most corrupt government in our recent history and the EU gave money to my government to bailout the banks. Money that they are *stealing,* you need to see how much the bad bank is paying for unfinished builidings or how much are earning the politicians in its board.

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"&gt;Is a trade union required for temp or part-time workers?

Nope

&gt;Is there a minimum income requirement?

There's a minimum hourly wage.

&gt;Is temporary or part-time work allowed?

Yes.

&gt;Is temporary or part-time work common?

Very common. The problem is often young workers have a hard time finding a job which doesn't have a temporary limit. We call those CDD (Contrats à Durée Déterminée - Contract with a Determined Duration). They usually last 6 months, and can only be renewed once or twice I believe, so that means the employer thus either has to then employ the worker in a CDI (Contract with an Undetermined Duration), or not employ him again.

&gt;What are the minimum and maximum allowed work hours per week?

There is no minimum, as some jobs are ""event jobs"" and so if an employer needs you to work for an hour a week, he can. The maximum an employer can force you to work is 35h a week, but most people work more than that because they're willing.

&gt;What are the taxes for employers and workers?

Very high. My salary drops by a third or something on my paycheck, because there are enormous amounts of charges, for healthcare and other things. Employers also pay a lot in taxes for each worker.

&gt;Do you have a national minimum wage?

Yup. We have a national hourly minimum wage, and a national full-time job minimum wage.

&gt;What is the history of the labor laws?

Very complex :p

&gt;What is the societal opinion of the current laws?

Too many taxes for employees and employers, hard for students or young workers to find a CDI, hard to not be forced into unpaid or badly paid internships. However, we understand employees have very strong worker rights, and some people (the right wing mostly) consider it hurts employment. 

&gt;Are there any upcoming law changes?

Minimum wage changes almost every year. It goes up slightly, according to inflation.

&gt;What are some common job roles filled by temp and part-time workers?

It can be anything, but I guess mostly reception jobs for part-time. 

&gt;Are there common illegal work schemes?

Not declaring your employee status I guess (ie, you legally don't have a job, but your employer pays you directly, under the table - avoids taxes for both parties). But that would be for low jobs, like construction and all. ",0,1376427632,null,0,false,0,cbn35jq,t3_1kaama,t1_cbn35jq,t3_1kaama,null,1429840911,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The current design dates from the Union of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. The flag combines aspects of three older national flags: the [red cross of St George](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/be/Flag_of_England.svg) for England and Wales (Wales was always seen as part of England in historical times), the [white saltire of St Andrew](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Flag_of_Scotland.svg) for Scotland (which were previously united in the [first Union Flag](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg), and the red saltire of [Saint Patrick's Flag](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/St_Patrick%27s_saltire.svg) to represent Ireland.

Boh, je vois pas le problème. Tant que tu partages ces *selfies* avec un cercle d'amis restreint, y a pas de souci en soi. Après, peut-être qu'un de tes amis est en fait un gros connard et va menacer de rendre une photo publique, mais c'est un tout autre sujet qui n'a d'ailleurs rien à voir avec le fait que les photos aient été mises en ligne. Ledit connard pourrait tout aussi bien menacer de publier une photo prise lui-même et enregistrée bien au chaud sur son disque dur.

No

&gt; Is there a minimum income requirement?

There is a minimum wage for full time  €752.85. If you work less hours you get less salary.

&gt; Is temporary or part-time work allowed?

Yes
&gt; Is temporary or part-time work common?

Temporary workers over EU average a 25%. Part time under EU average a 14.8%. [LinK](http://www.abc.es/economia/20130522/abci-tiempo-parcial-trabajo-201305212128.html) 

&gt; What are the minimum and maximum allowed work hours per week?

The same as for permanent employees.

&gt; What are the taxes for employers and workers?

The same as for permanent employees. Social security, income tax and public unemployment insurance.

&gt; Do you have a national minimum wage?

Yes, €752.85/month

&gt; What is the history of the labor laws?

We reform them often. Two reforms in the last three years. They went in the direction of making cheaper to fire permanent employees. And make easier to change without the salary and conditions of the workers.

&gt; What is the societal opinion of the current laws?

Firing is too cheap and easy speacially for the companies that are having profits like Telefonica.

&gt; Are there any upcoming law changes?

Probably the government will make easier to increase the working hours, pay lower salaries, increase the allowed unpaid overtime. And maybe make cheaper to fire.

&gt; What are some common job roles filled by temp and part-time workers?

Almost every job. Companies usually hire everybody as temporary worker and make permanent only when it's impossible to keep the employee in this type of contract. Administrative assisant, software developer(myself before moving to Sweden), waitress, chef, cleaner...

&gt; Are there common illegal work schemes?

Yes. With a lot of different levels. Having different companies an moving the employees from a company to other doing the work for keeping them in temp-contracts. Hiring somebody with an inferior category to pay under the agreed salary in the collective agreement. Hiring somebody part time a working full time. Retrieving part of the salary under table. Replace employees by interns(from software engineering in my previous company) for critical positions and for  the administrative assistant.

There is universe of fraud in the primary sector. Illegal immigrants earning under minimum wage. Relatives hired to say that you hired somebody to pick up the fruit that never went to the fields.

We also have two variants for maritime use, which both include the four flags of the main Italian [maritime republics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_republics) of the Middle Age (Venice, Genoa, Pisa, and Amalfi).

Note how, in the civilian flag, St. Mark's winged lion, the symbol of Venice, is showing an open book, that always reads in Latin (not in the flag though): ""Pax tibi Marce, evangelista meus"" (Peace to you Mark, my evangelist).

First of all, we have 3 types of contracts:

1. Umowa o pracę, a job contract under which you are under protection of the Labour code.

2. Umowa zlecenie, a contract protected by civil code. No employee rights, basically. You have to perform job leading to a given target, but you don't actually have to accomplish the target. Example might be maintaining a computer network.

3. Umowa o dzieło, another contract protected by civil code. You have to achieve given target, for example write a website.


&gt;1. Is a trade union required for temp or part-time workers?

No, it isn't.

&gt;2. Is there a minimum income requirement?

Nope

&gt;3. Is temporary or part-time work allowed?

Yes, but rules vary depending on type of contract

&gt;4. Is temporary or part-time work common?

Quite common, especially among younger and older people(on their pension)

&gt;5. What are the minimum and maximum allowed work hours per week?

No minimum I'm aware of, maximum depends on the type of contract - job contract(umowa o pracę) doesn't allow forcing people to work more than 8 hours a day and on average 40 hours a week(over the period of 4 months I think). Overtime, on average, can't be more than 8 hours a week(extra paid of course) and there aresome other restrictions which could easily exceed the character limit of this post.


&gt;6. What are the taxes for employers and workers?

Let's assume umowa o pracę(job contract). I'm going to copy my older entry. Types of insurance:

- ""emerytalne""(retirement)
- ""zdrowotne""(health)
- ""rentowe""(disabilities)
- ""chorobowe""(if you are sick that's from where the money is taken)
- ""wypadkowe""(in case of accident)


legend:

- ZUS - that's the branch of government taking care of your insurance(or not)
- OFE - that's a private account from where you can't take out your money; it is going to be used to pay your pension. You can inherit money from there, unlike from the government account.

9.76% of your salary(including bonuses) is spent on ""emerytalne"". In fact, your employer pays another 9.76% - but you don't have to care about it as long as he pays it. It adds up to 19.52% of your salary. 

2.3% of your salary goes to OFE, and 12.22%, goes to ZUS. You might've noticed that we're missing 5%. These were meant to go to OFE, but the government are keeping it in a separate account belonging to ZUS. Why? Because fuck you. That's the only comment about this system that I'm going to make.


To clarify, let's assume that you are going to make 3000zł a month, you are actually making even more - but you are not going to see this money anyway. Your employer pays 9.52%(emerytalne) + 6.5%(rentowe) + 0.6-3.5%(wypadkowe) of your salary. Assuming 1.93%, you actually make 3538.50zł a month you are actually making, not taking into account some other things the employer has to pay(fundusz pracy?). Now you pay 9.76%(emerytalne) + 1.5%(rentowe) + 2.45%(chorobowe) = 13.71% yourself. So you get 2588.70zł. You might say ""fuck, that's a lot less"". And then you realise you haven't paid your ""zdrowotne"" yet! You subtract 261,73zł and return home with 2326,97zł, which is ~23% less than you have on your umowa o pracę and at least 33% less than the ""raw"" cost of your employment. And you still haven't paid your income tax, but I'm tired already and have no desire to count this again. Tax-free amount is 3091zł, up to 85 000ish złoty the tax is 18%, above that 32%. Too much taxes work for today.

&gt;7. Do you have a national minimum wage?

If you have a job contract(umowa o pracę), 1600zł before taxes(which costs the employer 1931,84zł and you will see 1181,38zł. Otherwise(contractor type contracts, umowa zlecenie/umowa o dzieło) - nope.

&gt;8. What is the history of the labor laws?

I don't feel competent enough to answer that question, but until the fall of communism the only employer had been the government.


&gt;9. What is the societal opinion of the current laws?

The taxing system is hiding some of the employment costs, which should change. Being an entrepreneur is rather complicated.


&gt;10. Are there any upcoming law changes?

No major ones I am aware of.


&gt;11. What are some common job roles filled by temp and part-time workers?

Depending on location, but some of the most common in a city of ~800k people

- telemarketing

- distribution of leaflets

- cleaning

- direct sales

- picking fruit

- unpacking lorries

- restocking  shelves at supermarkets

- harassing tourists or as some might call it advertising local clubs

&gt;12. Are there common illegal work schemes?

true,intiwawa,null,null,"Ob es sich dabei um ""gefühlte"" Armut oder nicht handelt spielt keine Rolle. Wichtig ist, die Tendenz zu betrachten. Woher kommt das Geld, wohin geht es.

Kann es sein dass 10% der Bevölkerung 50% des Vermögens besitzen? Woher kommt das Geld? Die Leute müssen doch nichts mehr tun um noch mehr Geld dazu zu bekommen. Das Geld kommt von den niederen Schichten. Diese werden geschröpft über ein System was diesen Extremreichen immer mehr erleichtert dieses Geld zu bekommen. Es geht darum, dass die Geldverteilung in Richtung der Extremreichen immer einfacher wird statt das Geld in die Richtung zu verteilen wo es die Menschen wirklich brauchen.

Uns geht es ja noch relativ gut (wenn man nicht zu der Gruppe gehört von verarmten Rentnern, oder werdenden verarmten Rentern, der Mittelschicht die ebenfalls immer weniger bekommt) aber das wird nicht lange so andauern.

Wenn Sie mehr Informationen dazu suchen (und zu vielen anderen Themen), kann ich Ihnen wärmstens den Zündfunk Generator (http://www.br-online.de/podcast/mp3-download/bayern2/mp3-download-podcast-zuendfunk-generator.shtml) empfehlen. Ich finde gerade keinen passenden Podcast dazu aber hier: http://www.nachdenkseiten.de/ suchen Sie nach Vermögensverteilung und sie werden einige interressante Informationen erhalten.

Per quanto riguarda la sicurezza, dipende molto da dove stai (in alcune zone non si sta veramente molto tranquilli), e questo si lega bene con il problema dell'affitto e dei soldi: piu' una zona e' ""carina"" e sicura, piu' paghi. 
2000 euro al mese sono pochetti per Londra (sono poco piu' di 20000 sterline l'anno), ma probabilmente e' fattibile, soprattutto se ti trovi una stanza in affitto insieme con gente decente (io ho avuto esperienze sia buone che cattive, ma sono sopravvissuto). Comunque non pensare che il tuo tenore di vita raddoppi; il costo della vita e' molto piu' alto.

Il cibo e' terrificante, e' vero, ma puoi cucinarti da te e comunque almeno gli ingredienti di base si trovano.

Le considerazioni fondamentali che farei:

- Te la senti di fare un salto nel buio, e lasciare il tuo ambiente? 
- Se poi non ti trovi bene, considera che il tuo lavoro di oggi potrebbe essere sparito; sei preparato/a a fare un altro salto nel buio, e cercare altrove?

La cosa positiva e' che trovare e cambiare lavoro e' molto ma molto piu' facile, e puoi fare esperienze (anche lavorative) che in Italia ti puoi scordare.

true,og_nichander,EURO,European Union,"Finlandsvenskar were also similar peasants as any other tribes in the Swedish kingdom at the time. People did need to speak Swedish if they wanted to get ahead in life and so many also learned it. Interesting thing is that Finns, like other tribes, were able to speak their language in the army as well, also were led in Finnish. Hence, the war cry of the Swedish cavalry in 30 years of war ""Hakkaa päälle"". 

Because of the Hanseatic league of commerce in coastal towns actually German was really prominent or more like dominant. After all you had to be a ""Burger"" to live in the city. The catholic clergy and the university spoke Latin. Finland was indeed colonized as well, but not really as the later imperial sense of the word would have you think. More like internal movement. Swedish tribes lived on the coastal areas already before the kingdom. Genetic studies actually link Western Finns closest with the Dutch so go figure. 

But yes the whole idea of foreign rule is mostly due to national awakening of the late 1800's and it's autonomous Finnish government. The history was romanticized to serve the political needs of the time to garner resistance against the late efforts of Russification. Before autonomy Finland was just practically a part of Sweden, not governed any differently than the rest of the kingdom. We were also happy to be a Grand Duchy as long as Russians left us alone with our Swedish laws and government. 

But yeah Ethnic Swedes actually lived in Svealand - the vicinity of Stockholm and Uppsala as I think you probably know better than me. Norrland, which I think consisted of most of Dalarna as well, already was mostly of Finnic and Sami tribes. So no it wasn't a union of brothers, but a Kingdom of Sveamamma. She nursed and spanked us all without discrimination. Luckily enough Mamma Svea did not believe in serfdom or ""land slavery"" if you will, which was predominant in Europe and especially in Russia, where it was only abolished in late 1800's. Being descendants of free men, I think that is why the Nordics are still a great place of solidarity and equality to live and to prosper.

Please note that:

1) Those plans are meant only for people under 30. If you're not it's easy to get the SIM in someone else's name.

2) There is a 9€ one-time activation fee for both plans.

I don't think you can find better plans. Other mobile operators are getting on par with this plan, which was pretty unique one year ago, so you can find something as advantageous from Wind or Vodafone, I think.

The SIM card will work fine on the Nexus.

Avoid plans which may seem OK, but are actually binding you with a 24-month subscription. Always read the fine print, or get a TIM Young.

Close -- the North German Confederation was first to adapt black-white-read, as a merger of the Prussian white-black and white and red, which were prominent colors used by members of the Hanseatic League.

&gt; Then some fucktard decided to have the symbol of the nazi party as the national flag.

There was in interim period when the fucktards reintroduced black-white-red before switching to the swastika flag. There's a lot of symbolism associated with flags. During the Weimar Republic, black-red-gold changed from a symbol for the creation of a nation state (Freikorps, student fraternities) to that of the revolution and democracy. For monarchists and the nationalist right wing, it was an illegitimate flag, and they used the imperial black-white-red extensively during political campaigns. You can still see some of that today, actually.

true,jacenat,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Is a trade union required for temp or part-time workers?

No
&gt; Is there a minimum income requirement?

No
&gt; Is temporary or part-time work allowed?

Yes
&gt; Is temporary or part-time work common?

Overall no. In certain cases (women, students, ...) yes.
&gt; What are the minimum and maximum allowed work hours per week?

Depends.

Minimum part time with insurance is everything above 430€. It depends on your hourly salary how many hours that is. If you make 6€/hour (quite rare, but not unheard of), that's 17 hours/week. If you make 10€/hour, it's about 10 hours/week. Technical there is no min work hours per week. But below 430€ income/month, you are not insured.

Maximum daily (for usual workers) is 12 hours/day, 50 hours/week. I am not sure if there is a monthly limit below the linear extrapolation of that. Since we have elections soon, the idea of max 10 hours/day is being thrown around. You get overtime pay (150%) for every our after your 8th on any given day. Hours worked on weekends or between 9pm and 6am also each are valued at 150%. The higher rate is additive, not cummulative (but don't quote me on that).

You can work more than 12 hours/day off the record. But during that time you are not insured, and the employer is has no legal obligation to compensate. Also the employer is fined if officials find eployees working longer than 12 hours/day. So it's a bad idea all around and only ever used in small companies and for jobs that are not risk prone.
&gt; What are the taxes for employers and workers?

As a worker, you pay 18% (or 20%) social security and 35% for income above 11.000€/year and 42% for income above 24.000€/year and 50% for income above 35.000€/year. Income tax is calculated after deducting social security tax.

Additionally, the employer pays

* 22% social security tax.
* 3% city tax
* 1,5% employee prevention
* 4,5% family tax
* 0,4-0,5% misc taxes

&gt; Do you have a national minimum wage?

No
&gt; What is the history of the labor laws?

We still have strong unions. Labor laws are better than in many other developed countries, although support for mothers to return to jobs is lacking.
&gt; What is the societal opinion of the current laws?

It's allright overall. There is scepticism of temp workers and how they undermine union strength.
&gt; Are there any upcoming law changes?

Lowering max hours/day from 12 to 10 is discussed due to upcoming elections.
&gt; What are some common job roles filled by temp and part-time workers?

Building cleaning. Tourism (everything from waiters, cooks to maids). Construction. Administration. IT.

Usually in these fields you are starting at temp positions. In the better fields you get permanent positions after 1-2 years. Laws are in place to prevent chaining of temp contracts more often than 2 times.
&gt; Are there common illegal work schemes?

Handywork and construction have work off the record due to their nature of work. Other than that black labor is not too common.",0,1376457537,null,0,false,0,cbndepv,t3_1kaama,t1_cbndepv,t3_1kaama,null,1429836056,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

First, ""The descendants of slaves"" as you call them didn't really have to integrate in today's sens because they were already there before the idea that the thirteen colonies could be independant even came to anyone's mind. 

They actually did participate to the building of the US. They were there from the beginning, which is not the case of immigrants in Europe today, who were not there 50 years ago and who come to countries which, for some of them like France, have a defined identity for already 1000 years. 

To put it simply, the US is not the home of a defined ethnicity or culture, unlike europeans countries. The US is the product of a recent worldwide immigration, and the US is based on an idea, not on a identity.

Second, the american black population is different on another level : the culture.
One of the most important effect of slavery and deportation from Africa has been the acculturation of the descendants of blacks slaves. They forgot their ancestral language, culture, religions, to completely embrace the new one. Black americans are not different culturally from white americans. They have english names (hence why Malcolm choose to take ""X"" as patronym, he didn't want to bear anymore the name of the master of his ancestors), they speak english, they are protestants, and most importantly, they don't have a cultural memory from Africa.

true,metroxed,EUSK,Basque Country,"The Basque flag is named [Ikurrina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikurri%C3%B1a) and it is rather new. During the 18th and 19th centuries there had been several attemps to create a flag that could represent the Basque provinces, but none of them prospered. Let's not forget Navarre already had its own flag, the [Royal Standard of the Kingdom of Navarre](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Bandera_de_Reino_de_Navarra.svg/500px-Bandera_de_Reino_de_Navarra.svg.png), but it vaguely represented the rest of Basque provinces, which despite all having been part of the kingdom, it had been for different amounts of time each and under different circumstances.

The [antecedent](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Flag_of_the_Basque_Country_by_Sabino_Arana.svg/500px-Flag_of_the_Basque_Country_by_Sabino_Arana.svg.png) of the current flag was designed by [Sabino Arana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabino_Arana) and his brother in 1894. According to Arana, the red represented the colours of the coat of arms of Biscay, the white cross respresented Christianity, and the green cross the [Oak of Gernika](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gernikako_Arbola), historical symbol of the Basque autonomy. The flag was initially used as the official flag for the party that Arana himself founded, the Basque Nationalist Party, and was used only in the province of Biscay. Its name, ikurrina (*ikurriña* in Spanish), originally *ikuŕiña*, is a neologism created by Arana; the word *ikur* means ""symbol"" in Basque. 

The flag was adopted as an official symbol of three Basque provinces (Euskadi) in 1936, but its use was strictly forbidden during the Francoist dictatorship (1939-1975). In 1979, a [slighty modified version](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Flag_of_the_Basque_Country.svg/500px-Flag_of_the_Basque_Country.svg.png) was adopted as official flag of the autonomous community of the Basque Country. Although unofficial, it is also widely used in northern Navarre and in the French Basque Country (Iparralde), as well as in Basque communities overseas; it has become the symbol of the Basque culture and language.

Although it is common to hear, and most people even here tend to think so, that the flag was inspired by the British [Union Jack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Jack), it is much more likely than the original inspiration (as well as colours) came from the [Royal Standard of the Kingdom of Navarre](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Bandera_de_Reino_de_Navarra.svg/500px-Bandera_de_Reino_de_Navarra.svg.png).",0,1376472208,null,0,1376476615,0,cbng7eb,t3_1kaepz,t1_cbng7eb,t3_1kaepz,null,1429834750,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

You have to know that in Paris there are some untold rules and the atmosphere can drastically change ine the same arrondissement or even in the same street. A part of a street can be ""popular"" and passed a bridge it becomes more ""classy"".

For exemple in the 18th, the Montmartre area is nice (very touristic too) but the rue de la goutte d'or/ boulevard Barbès area is kinda crappy (but still in the 18th) that's why you have both positives and negatives. Some places like Pigalles/place Blanche used to be crappy in the past but are globally clean now.
In the 17th Boulevard de Clichy is still little crappy, but Batignoles is classy (but not very exciting)
You should avoid the area of Belleville (that doesn't deserves its name), Barbès, la goutte d'or, the area of Gare du Nord is not so cool too.
If you like bars, clubs, you should try the areas of Bastille, Saint Michel (expensive, near the Sorbonne, the Panthean and Luxembourg), le Marais (main gay area in Paris, very nice and living area), Montparnasse is okay, St Lazare too (near Printemps and Galeries Lafayette) but quite expensive.

&gt;Government staying out of whether gays and polygamists are allowed or not allowed to marry

There are two ""marriages"" in Germany the religious one, which has absolutely no legal meaning, and the public one which gives you tax breaks and certain rights to your partner. The first one the government has no control over whatsoever and for the second one the Government declares what rights married people have. So staying out of is not really happening. 

&gt;Government respecting peoples right to religion (i.e. I am not a scientologist, but find it offensive that the government gets to categorize it as a cult, let people make their own mistakes)

Scienceidioty is not forbidden, they can still operate and people can still join them. What they can't get is tax breaks.

&gt;Government not allowing religions to impose themselves on others (i.e. not using christian morality as a legal justification)

This is pretty much modus operandi in the whole western world, so mission accomplished.

&gt;Respecting parents right to home-school

Home-schooling is illegal in Germany. There are literally no rights to respect.

&gt; Is a trade union required for temp or part-time workers?

No. Neither for fulltime employment, unless some sectors I don't know of require it. But generally no.

&gt; Is there a minimum income requirement?

No. Possibly to change soon. 

&gt; Is temporary or part-time work allowed?

Yes. 

&gt; Is temporary or part-time work common?

I think that it's increasingly so. Replacing fulltime and stable positions.

&gt; What are the minimum and maximum allowed work hours per week?

?
Max is 48 (8h x 6d) in theory. That's fulltime. 

&gt; What are the taxes for employers and workers?

As far as income tax goes, afaik that yearly income becomes taxable only when it exceeds 19 500EUR/yr (starting at 20% and it's progressive), while corporations pay a uniform 12,5% tax.

There's a temporary contribution to the state (because *reasons*) that starts when monthly income exceeding 2 500EUR (by 3%, split 50/50 among employee and employer) and it's progressive. 

Other than that, both the employer and the employee contribute to the employee's social security. 50/50 or 60/40, that's the two arrangements I've seen. It's about 50EUR each. It's increasingly common for employers to present this dilemma though: social security and a pay cut, or no social security and the wage stays as it is? 

&gt; Do you have a national minimum wage?

No. Some sectors have a minimum wage set by decree and it's different for each. Some sectors don't have at all, so maybe it's wise to belong to an union if that's the case. I think that for retail it stands at 850EUR/month gross salary, and you can expect to pocket about 750EUR of those after social security etc.

&gt; What is the history of the labor laws?

Well I watched a documentary about the Cypriot Mines and the first large scale strike on the island, about 80 years ago, but I guess that's not relevant.

&gt; What is the societal opinion of the current laws?

At the moment: ""I'm happy I could find a job at all"".

I assume that soon everyone will be an unpaid intern though. 

&gt; Are there any upcoming law changes?

Yep. This are quite fluid right now, but the general direction is lower wages, fewer protections, introduction of the concept of unpaid internships. Possibly on the upside, promise that a system of guaranteed minimum income will be implemented in 2014. 

&gt; What are some common job roles filled by temp and part-time workers?

Where I live, retail and services. 

&gt; Are there common illegal work schemes?

Working off-contract, I'd guess. I don't know how common it is. 

Now, on unilateral illegalities by the part of the employer, that's more common. As I described above, threatening with a pay cut to make the employee pay the 100% of social security contributions or drop insurance completely does happen.

In Spain, as in the rest of Europe, there's increasingly a two-tier market in many goods and services, due to the irruption of low-cost providers in many different areas.

Some have already mentioned air fares: flying with low-cost carriers like Ryanair, Easyjet, Vueling or Wizzair can be considerably cheaper than with ""conventional"" airlines (but make sure that you book your journey well in advance, and aren't tricked into contracting some expensive extra service like travel insurance, luggage fees, etc.).

Then there's the issue of telecoms, especially for mobiles: an MVNO like Simyo or Lebara will usually offer you a much better deal than Movistar or Vodafone.

The Spanish Inditex group (Zara, Massimo Dutti, etc.) arguably leads the world in low-cost fashion.

But there's even groceries: some here have mentioned the big-box stores of Carrefour, but their prices are consistently undercut by discounters like Lidl and Aldi, or even the local Spanish chain Mercadona (which, incidentally, offers IMHO better choice, quality and service than Carrefour, never mind barebone discounters Aldi and Lidl).

Basically, competition in Europe in general and Spain in particular is fiercer than it has ever been, and a canny consumer can make very good deals. In Spain there's only one particular exception, which is energy. Spanish energy companies, whether it's electricity providers or oil and gas companies, are a notoriously chummy bunch, with friends in high places. They've so far succeeded in charging extortionate prices, without any sanctions by the competition authorities.

Also, from a consumer point of view, the downside of the current cutthroat price-based competition among low-cost airlines, MVNOs or discount retailers is very, very crappy service.

Trains planes and buses are all great ways to move around. You can find great deals booking in advance with low cost flight companies.

Black people COULDN'T keep on white people because they were refused to do so. 

But it doesn't mean that black people were not fully integrate to the american society, they were A PART of american society. Without black people, America today would be something completely different. It's not like the chinese or arab minority if France and UK who are there for 50 years ago max. They still don't have changed the european society on a big level.

Black people did. I mean, nearly ALL musical innovations in America (and well, in the world) came from black americans.

Jazz, be-bop, blues, soul, rock'n'roll, funk, disco, hip-hop, rap etc. All from afro-americans origins. The way people dress has been modified by black people, the way people talk, the conception of what is ""cool"" or not, professional sport. In the cinema too, there's a shitload of black people, there's as much big black stars than there is big whites stars.

Integration doesn't only have socio-economic concerns.

And even on a socio-economic level the situation is different. I mean, man, they have a black president ! There is today a real black american bourgeoisie and intelligentsia.

true,DaHitcha,cinefilo,,"First of all try not to be overwhelmed, Rome is a very chaotic place and Romans are used to deal with it with a bit of resignation and a lot of humor. Don't be a tourist if you don't want to be treated like one(mislead, overpriced for everything, getting the crap tourist traps instead of the real deals), live the city day by day, mix with the locals instead of trying to pair up with you're connationals at all times. Walk a lot, Rome is really something beautiful and the more when it's unexpected. Do you speak some italian? Are you planning to learn it? Depending of the type of school or university you're enrolling (I suppose you are, maybe not though) you may have discounts or free access to museums, cinemas and such. There's a little cinema in very centre of the city, the Nuovo Olimpia in Via in Lucina, very near to Via Del Corso, that screens films in their original version, english ones most of the times. Try to forget about McDonalds and BurgerKing and Subway and such, there are amazing places to eat the very best of Italian and Roman traditional cousine, some are cheap take away, some are more expensive but you can really survive and eat very well just forgetting what you're used to when you're home. Find the bakeries, in Rome the go by the name of Forno and there are plenty of that in Trastevere as well in the rest of the city, you can't say you've lived a little until you try pizza bianca with or without mortadella(or bogna as you call it). Also round every corner there's a take away pizzeria (pizza al taglio) that serves not only pizza but also fast meals like roast chicken, potatoes fried or baked, fried vegetables, fried rice balls with mozzarella that go by the name of supplì. Yeah, in rome they fry almost everything, you must try the artichoke, a roman/jewish tradion, you can find it everywhere but mostly in the narrow street that delimits the old jewish ghetto, Via Del Portico D'Ottavia. When you're tired of pizza and fried things (although admit it, you can never be tired of pizza and fried things) try out the local markets where you can find a huge variety of raw ingredients to make up your own meals. 

Also check the FAQs on the side, there are plenty of suggestions to start with.

About the rest of Italy, I guess the cheaper way would be traveling by long distance buses, but the fastest would be by train(high velocity ones go by the name Frecciarossa and Frecciabianca) and if you book the tickets in advance (a couple of months would be great) you can find good discount rates. Planes also would be cheap if you book them in advance, being based in Rome gives you plenty of possibilities. 

In the early fall Sardinia is beautiful and if is still warm enough you could still bathing in some of it's beaches. You could go there by plane or boat from Civitavecchia port. You're very near to the wonderful cities of Umbria region (Perugia, Urbino, Assisi, Gubbio, Spello, Spoleto) and the most amazing food you may ever taste. A little south and there's Abruzzo, a little north and there are Marche and Emilia-Romagna, beside them Tuscany, every travel in Italy is a discovery of both breath-taking landscape and panoramas and amazing food and wine and you can do it also with a low budget. There's great beauty in the big cities of the north like Genoa, Turin, Milan, Verona, Trieste and the obvious Venice of course. And they are easier to reach by train being on the principal routes.

Can I have a rant about the sizes of cities in the UK?

I'm from Bradford. 

http://www.ukcities.co.uk/populations/

According to that I'm from the sixth largest city in the country. It is larger than Liverpool, Manchester, Edingburgh and Bristol. In the latter two cases I could *maybe* at an outside chance believe it but in the former two it is complete and utter bollocks. 

Manchester is surrounded by towns and cities that have a different local government but which would be small villages if they were not in the orbit of Manchester. Head down Oxford Road in Manchester from the university and a few hundred yards from the city centre you will see a sign saying that you are now entering Manchester. You will have travelled several miles already believing yourself to be in Manchester. But you're not, you're only entering it when you get to the city centre. Head out to the west of the city and you're actually in Salford. To the east you're in Oldham. But be in one of these places and say you're ""going in to town"" and it's Manchester you're heading to. 

The conurbation of Greater Manchester is closer to 3 million. What it absolutely isn't is half a million people. That's an accidental by product of local government and lines drawn on a map, it has nothing to do with the community, relations between people and the paths of economic activity that you might normally expect to define what a city is. 

edit: Look how high Wakefield is on that list too. Wakefield is a town of about 100,000 people but it is a metropolitan unitary authority, just like Bradford is. There is no county council and all the towns near to it but far more seperate from it than Salford is from Manchester like Castleford and Normanton are included in Wakefield's count. It's a similar story in Bradford with towns like Keighley. They did have their own local authority once, and by this count were thus their own distinct places. Now Keighley is part of Bradford despite there being seven miles of countryside between the two. 

Rant over. As you were.

true,wh15p3rz,null,null,"I've been living in Paris for 9 years now so here are some things I enjoy. (It's only my experience and I'm sure there's plenty of other things to do)


Things to see in Paris, no money needed (or things Parisians say they should see and never do it) :

- Montmartre. It's the neighborhood in the movie ""Amélie Poulain"" and it's where I live. If you get there by the Abbesses metro station : DON'T TAKE THE STAIRS ! No kidding it feels like they are infinite. The view over Paris from the Sacré-Coeur is really nice.

- Montmartre again. You are coming here in october and I just remembered it's the ""Vendanges de Montmartre"" (grappe harvesting time) from the 9th to the 13th october. There are a lot of animations around this event (plus it's the 80th anniversary) and there's a fireworks on the saturday.

- The Champs Elysées. I don't go there really often but when I do, I complain about the tourists all the way down.

- Les Galeries Lafayette. I just go there for window shopping. The building itself is a nice piece of architecture.

- The Opera (Garnier). At the Opera metro station. Actually, I would advice you to get off at the ""Pyramides"" metro station and walk on the ""avenue de l'opéra"" so you can see the building from further away. Sometimes there is a band of students from the music school playing on the stairs.

- Les Tuileries. It's the park near the Louvres where I hangout when it's sunny.

- Free exhibit at Hôtel de ville. I always wanted to visit one and never took the time to do it. It gets a lot of success here. In october, the exhibit will be ""absolutely eccentric""(The works of 163 artists from social and medical structures offering an artistic activity and creative workshops to support people with mental and emotional disabilities. The exhibition pays tribute to the painter Marc Eberschweiler).

- Drinking / eating on the river banks. But I'm afraid the weather won't be nice enough in october to do that.


Real tourist things I've done and loved :

- The Eiffel tower. As someone living here, I almost never go there but when I do I alway take the stairs because it's less crowded and cheaper. I think you can also buy online tickets to avoid the queue.

- The riverboat (""bateau-mouche""). We did it with my family for my little sister birthday and I really liked it. It's relaxing and you can see a lot of famous monuments from the Seine.


Food is an important part of the french culture. Some places I go to :

- One of my favorite (french) restaurant is [""l'auberge du clou""](https://maps.google.fr/maps?q=30,+avenue+de+Trudaine+75009+Paris&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hnear=30+Avenue+Trudaine,+75009+Paris,+%C3%8Ele-de-France&amp;gl=fr&amp;t=m&amp;z=16). They serve Auvergn food and I would recommand the ""Aligot"" which is a kind of mash potatoes with cheese and garlic. On mondays you can bring your own bottle of wine. 

- For a good pizza : [Pomodoro](https://maps.google.fr/maps?q=POMODORO,+Rue+la+Vieuville,+Paris&amp;hl=fr&amp;ll=48.886222,2.3388&amp;spn=0.0504,0.132093&amp;sll=48.870361,2.322922&amp;sspn=0.100831,0.264187&amp;oq=pomodoro+vieuvil+paris&amp;hq=POMODORO,&amp;hnear=Rue+la+Vieuville,+75018+Paris&amp;t=m&amp;z=14).

- Asian Noodle ? [Les pâtes vivantes](https://maps.google.fr/maps?q=les+pates+vivantes+75009&amp;hl=fr&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=48.872986,2.345967&amp;spn=0.025206,0.066047&amp;hq=les+pates+vivantes&amp;hnear=9e+Arrondissement,+Paris,+%C3%8Ele-de-France&amp;t=m&amp;z=15). They make the noodle themselves in front of the customers. The first time I went there with my boyfriend we did the mistake of taking appetizers. I barely touched my main course (they were kind enough to pack it in a box so I can bring it home). It's something like 9-10€ / pers for a meal.

- Japanese food (Not sushis and makis) : There are plenty in [rue Sainte-Anne](https://maps.google.fr/maps?q=Rue+Sainte-Anne,+Paris&amp;hl=fr&amp;ll=48.866225,2.336655&amp;spn=0.012605,0.033023&amp;sll=48.872986,2.345967&amp;sspn=0.025206,0.066047&amp;oq=rue+sainte+Ann&amp;hnear=Rue+Sainte-Anne,+Paris&amp;t=m&amp;z=16), not far from the Opera. I've tested Sapporo (One of the biggest and most famous, at the 37) and Kunitoraya (much smaller but more traditional, at the 39). Both are not to expensive (around 10-12€/pers. for a meal). In another neighborhood, a way more expensive one : [Hotaru](https://maps.google.fr/maps?q=hotaru+18+Rue+Rodier,+Paris+restaurant&amp;hl=fr&amp;ll=48.878179,2.342631&amp;spn=0.006301,0.016512&amp;sll=48.878165,2.342631&amp;sspn=0.006329,0.016512&amp;hq=hotaru+18+Rue+Rodier,+Paris+restaurant&amp;t=m&amp;z=17).

- In rue Saint-Anne you will also find ""le vin qui danse"" [(their website, in english)](http://www.vinquidanse.com/index.php/en/). I've never been disappointed but it can get really expensive.
- For really good sandwiches : le [Balt](https://maps.google.fr/maps?q=balt+15+rue+Monsigny+75002+Paris&amp;hl=fr&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=balt&amp;hnear=15+Rue+Monsigny,+75002+Paris,+%C3%8Ele-de-France&amp;t=m&amp;z=16). Quite expensive for sandwiches but great quality.

- I oftenly take my breakfast at [KB Cafeshop](https://maps.google.fr/maps?q=kb%20coffee%20paris&amp;um=1&amp;hl=fr&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=993&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=il). They do great cakes but what I prefer for breafast will always be some baguette with butter and jelly.


Oh and some advices while I'm there :

- Even if most people working with tourists speaks english (at least enough to do their job), don't speak directly in english. Just ask before ;)

- At least you should know the works ""bonjour"" (hello), ""merci"" (thank you) and ""au revoir"" (good bye).

- Tips are not mandatory in food service (and other services) but it's customary. For reference, I leave 1-2€ for drinks, 3-5€ for a meal. (This week-end we went to a restaurant -which was not in Paris unfortunatly - With a friend and we left around 12€ because everything was just perfect).

- Be carefull with your belongings. I know thieves especially target tourists as they know they carry fancy cameras and a lot of cash. 

- The metro can get you almost anywhere in Paris in less than 40 minutes and it's part of the city's culture. The [RATP Website](http://www.ratp.fr/en/ratp/c_5000/accueil/) can help you plan all your travel in the city (yes there's an english version ;). If you are here for a month I would recommand you to take a ""Navigo Pass"" with zone 1-2 (be carefull here the pass isn't for 30 day but from the 1st to the end of the month). It costs 20€/week or 65€/month for unlimited fair. The magnetric card itself is 5€ and you'll need a photo ID.

One thing to consider is that SNCF pricing is globally out of any common human logical schemes, don't try to understand precisely how it works, it just does'nt work :D.
If you take the TGV try to have a prem's ticket on the prebook it is way cheaper.
Common tips to have cheaper tickets with sncf is either booking long time before departure or with train which are far tu be full just a short time before departure (sncf lower ticket prices to fill the train).
Then it depends when you take the train, obviously from friday evening to sunday evening it is more expensive. 
Outward trip in the morning or return trip in the evening are also more expensive.

I am talking about immigration on a cultural, and unfortunately, ethnic level. Let's take Sweden, but it works for France, UK etc.

So in Sweden there's two categories which can be considered as sowewhat more or less ""alien"" to Sweden society : simply immigrants, i.e. people arrived in Sweden when they were adult, for X or Y reason (war, look for a job etc.), and people born in Sweden but from immigrants parents (this second category is less ""alien"" than the first one, because swedish is their native language etc.).

Why are they alien ? They are because Sweden is defined by an identity which take its roots more than a millenium ago. Saying that because they have swedish has native language, go to swedish school they're not different and can blend completely in the rest of the society is hypocritical, or naïve, even for people considered as well integrated. 

There already is a ""standard"" for what swedish people are. They are whites, often fair-haired, christian, have swedish names etc.

If a swedish citizen is called Muhammad and have a brown skin, even if he is perfectly integrated, even if he only speak swedish, have a swedish wife, give swedish names to his children, even if he win a fucking nobel prize, a simple look will tell everyone that he is still not really swedish. That's the ugly truth. You can deny it if you want, it has a huge importance that everyone deny in public, but still think about it in private.

Not to forget that they often have a double culture, which make everything more complex. Should I completely give up on the culture of my parents ? What my family think about all this ? Will I be a kind of ""traitor"" ?
Or should I just live in Sweden but refuse the swedish customs ?

Theses two points, physical appearance and culture are capital. They are a huge part of the problem.

I know it better than everyone else : I am myself a french citizen with an arab father. 

It doesn't matter if I only speak french and my only culture is french (my parents decided to completely raise me in french culture, arab culture is as foreign for me than for the most franco-french that you can find); it doesn't matter if I have been major/valedictorian from middle school to the end of high school. It doesn't matter if I passed one of the hardest enter examination in the world to enter in the most prestigious french Grande Ecole. It doesn't matter if I am atheist and know more about christianism than islam (catholic school) All that doesn't matter because half of my genes and my name are arab. You can see it on my face. 

And I can tell you than society never miss to remind me that I am not ""completely french"". Don't get me wrong : I don't say immigration problems are all the fault of society, that french are racist or whatever else, my point is to say that unfortunately, it is an inevitable problem that will happened in all european countries. 

And that is a problem which make a huge difference with the afro american people. Because they are in US since the dawn of the US. They made the US. They only speak english, they are protestant etc. I won't remake the same rant. The problems with black populations are completely differents from the immigrants in europe one. They're NOT driven by the same factors. 

Because it's not a problem of INTEGRATION, they ALREADY ARE a part of the american identity, unlike me with the french one or that random nobel price Muhammad guy in Sweden. Me or that guy fall in the studies on immigration and integration. Not black american. They weren't an ""american identity"" when they arrived in America, they did participate to build this american identity.

Why do I do such a long rent ? Because I see this comparison all the time and it drives me mad. They are two completely different problems, and looking for a valid comparison between them only show your lack of knowledge about both history of afro-american and history of immigration in Europe.",0,1376482821,null,0,1376483070,0,cbnhp9g,t3_1kb7xd,t1_cbnhp9g,t1_cbngynf,null,1429833981,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Bullshit. You dont even know what ""Middle class"" is. Let me show you:

&gt;""So plant die SPD, den Spitzensteuersatz von 42 auf 49 Prozent zu erhöhen - aber erst ab einem Jahreseinkommen von 100.000 Euro für Ledige (bisher etwa 53.000) und 200.000 Euro für Verheiratete.""

&gt;[source](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/hoehere-steuern-fuer-wohlhabende-auf-die-reichen-mit-gebruell-1.1431122-2)

That would be 8.300€/month (single) and 16.700€/month (married).

You are only middle class citizen if your income is between 70%-150% of the ""Nettoäquivalenzeinkommen"". 
If you look at the table closely, you can calculate, that NO middle class citizen will be affected:

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mittelschicht#Statistische_Definitionen

**Or I do the math for you:**

**Single:** 

100.000 x 0,50= 50.000

50.000 -20% = **40.000** upward

For a single man (with a child) 150% are 31.200€/year.

**Married:**

200.000 x 0,50= 100.000

100.000 -20% = **80.000** upward

For a married couple (with 2 childs) 150% are 50.400€/year.


So, the tax plans in discussion from SPD only makes taxes higher for people who have 125% upwards the income of a middle class citizen with more than 150% of the Nettoäquivaleneinkommen.

That means everybody above that is rich. and that means, the tax plans from SPD really only affects the very rich people.

&gt;""Eins ist sicher: Die Rente"". I believe it when I am going to become a pensioneer, somtime in the 2060s

Our Pension fonds are as full as never before. Our Nachhaltigkeitsrücklage is 8,5 times as high as it has to be. Additionally, the myth of the demoprahic change will not affect us much.

If we dont fuck up our family politics now, we just absorb it with more working women, more foreigner coming to work in germany and maybe trough the ""Rente mit 67"". (If Rot-Grün don't back up to the ""Rente mit 65"" again.)

 But that's a very complicated topic, before i allow me a complete evaluation I first want to wait some time.

Funny how you don't want to understand me.

First: The conervative party fucked themselves and their family politics trough their ""Herdprämie"". That was only Klientelpolitik and won't be helpful against the demographic change; it's contraproductive for the KiTa System.

The KiTa system is very important to stop negative effects of the demographic change. We will desperatly need more working women to fill the gaps left in the Job market.

&gt;  The conervative party fucked themselves and their family politics trough their ""Herdprämie"". That was only Klientelpolitik and won't be helpful against the demographic change; it's contraproductive for the KiTa System.

Let's take a step back and consider that the KiTa system is not good at all. It only becomes relevant if your goal is to put more women into the workforce, thus lowering average wages, thus lowering standard of living. 

The Rechtsanspruch from the third year of a child was formulated by § 24 SGB VIII, Artikel 1 - in 1996, when Kohl still was Kanzler. It was lowered to the first year by the Kinderförderungsgesetz of 2008 - when Merkel was Kanzler. The whole idea of KiTas is a **conservative**, not a social-democratic or a green idea.

&gt; The KiTa system is very important to stop negative effects of the demographic change. We will desperatly need more working women to fill the gaps left in the Job market.

Or we could re-start paying sane wages instead. The most gaps will happen in job areas where there traditionally are very few women to begin with - for instance, I know very few Facharbeiterinnen für Metallbau...

I say that because I could imagine what kind of damage could have hit Germany if we didn't get the Agenda trough.

Actually, I think a minimum wage is exactly what we *do not want* - there are jobs that are not worth 8,5 €/h, and those would immediately be scrapped, thus leading to raising unemployment.

Mandatory union contracts for companies (&gt;10 people) which right now do not have one would be a good first step, and unions which are not only in the business of giving head to the industry.

To help you understand with the help of an example:

I'm from the Saarland. In the past, our very only industry was coal &amp; steel (but not very precisised steel industry, just like nails and that shit :D).

After China floated the world market with cheap coal, we got a problem. It was clear that our industry had no future, but we had no alternative. If we hadnt the (enormous) subsidies helped our coal &amp; steel industry not to fail, there would have been nearly the whole Saarland without work.

The subsidies buyed us time to restructurate our whole industry:

* Coal industry was slowly closed down
* After there was too many cheap steel, too, we had to specialise our steel production, the steel companies got still problems, but nothing they can't handle
* We got some other industry branches to settle here, like Ford
* We got a big IT sector and a big middle class IT company (IDS Scheer) with thousands of employes

Now , with 5,5% economy growth, we have the highest rate among the Bundesländer in germany.

Without the subsidies, there would have been so many people in unemployment and on welfare, plus, our economy would be so down, it would have been too hard to get out of that shit. you could say that we buyed us time. I think, it was totally worth it.

Edit: 

But still: (and here is healthy sceptism helpful) the workers in the coal industry got overly enormous pensions &amp; wages + we always make jokes how everything was stealed at the ""Grub"".

Or maybe, instead of taking care of the ones who perform badly, we stop trying to ""leave no child behind"" and spend tons of money on people who do not want to get better we return an air of achievement and excellence back by applauding those who *do* work for their results? 

How about we stop having teachers be Beamte and make them fireable if their results (tested by annual centralized tests similar to the Abitur) are too bad?

How about we help overachievers who currently are being ridiculed or told that they should just sit and not participate to ""give their fellow students a chance""?

&gt; That's exactly why we can't have nice things. Please, tell me one Job who isn't worth that, and then ( to counter exactly your reasoning) why we need it.

*sigh* Basic economics time.

Every job can only cost as much as it brings in or saves in operation costs. If the work of a worker only brings in 5 Euros per hour, you can't pay him 8,50€. 

Let's take an obvious example - janitorial services. They bring in essentially nothing in the random workplace. They are mostly there to keep the employees happy. If the employees happiness is worth less than the cost of the janitorial service, bam, dusty monitors everywhere. 

If you raise wages, you raise cost of service, and eventually the break-even is passed.

&gt; We don'd have a goo infrastructure because of the Investitionsstau because of the line from Merkel and the Bundesregierung.

We don't have good infrastructure because we have had two decades of wasted planning thanks to the Aufbau Ost and local citizens being unhelpful by protesting projects that overall would have benefitted the country, e.g. the Transrapid project, mostly out of irrational fears.

The problems have started *decades* earlier.

&gt; We don't have a space program because that would be incredible bullshit.

... irrational fears. We are a technology exporter. We need state-funded research and development, and we need a demonstration platform. A manned space program would have provided both.

That being said: We do have a space program. Just not a manned one, and one that is severely underfunded.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;Yeah, but the border between france and spain is the exception, most borders don't really have natural reasons. There is no true difference between walloon's side and flemish

They're two economic clusters, one the Flemish Diamond, and the other the Sillon Industriel of Wallonia. Not to mention the geographical differences. For example, you'll have a much harderer time promoting bicycling in Wallonia: they need a separate policy. In fact, it was Wallonia who demanded separate regions to be able to enact policies tailored to their needs.

&gt;except the cultural one (mostly language to be honest)

I've worked with both, it's quite a bit more.

&gt;and the same difference exist between bxl and vlaanderen (maybe a little bit smaller difference).

Take a blind satellite map and try to formulate rules that allows you to trace the Brussels Region. You can't.

&gt;To be really honest, most bxl speak French, so if we follow the reasons behind the flemish/waloon frontier, you get bruxelle in the waloon territory.

If we're going by the ""most people speak..."" rule, then Belgium speaks Dutch. 

This is brought up so often as if it proves anything, but the bilingual zone was *defined* as a place with many French speakers... so honestly it shouldn't come as a surprise that there is indeed a French speaking majority. Due to the way it was defined, it's *technically impossible* for it to be anything but French speaking.

Naturally, everyone only brings up the ""majority decides"" rule in areas where they think they have a majority.

&gt;Now I'm not saying this reason is a good one, but it's the one which is the idea behind most frontiers, so unless you choose to delete every other frontier except the one which have a natural reason, you'd get most of the EU as one block.

The Regions are intended for economic policy and therefore should be demarcated to be useful for those purposes. If they also were defined by language, we wouldn't have a distinction between Regions and Communities.

There's an interesting study that catalogued all borders in the world according to their origin. Ethnic composition was not very common. Military coincidence was the most common.

&gt;So, again, I'm not saying we're be better off with a frontier between bxl and vlaanderen, but it wouldn't make sense to delete this frontier, and it would make less sense to add it to the dutch territory than to the french, because that would be forgetting that the reason behind those frontiers are about the people and not the ""natural"" limit.

No, the Regions are defined as being about geographical issues. It's the Communities that are about people issues.",0,1376489340,null,0,false,0,cbnjatz,t3_1k7e9t,t1_cbnjatz,t1_cbnitxz,null,1429833236,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt; For the Olympics, I think it would be a great example for LGBT in Russia for there to be openly gay and successful athletes as role models present, something that would be lost if they decided not to go. Think back to the black athletes in Hitler's Olympics for example.

I was inclined to agree, then I saw [this](http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/08/13/russia_and_the_ioc_agree_athletes_and_spectators_shouldn_t_be_openly_gay.html) (ok, is Slate, but they have sources)

&gt; On Monday, the Russian Interior Ministry confirmed what other Russian officials have been saying for weeks: Openly gay people attending the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, including athletes, will be arrested under the country’s draconian new anti-gay law. 

and

&gt; According to an IOC spokesperson, the Olympics aren’t the place for “proactive political or religious demonstration,” anyway. Just read the fine print: Rule 50 of the Olympic charter declares that “no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas.

So, in a country where being openly gay is a criminal offense, neither IOC will help you because they want to keep it apolitical, and being openly gay in some countries is a political issue and not simply a part of life as in your Belgiums and Canadas. 

If I was a gay athlete, I'd pull out and let the rest of the team go on their own. It's all too much, really. I don't even know how Russian LGBTs can win some basic decency any time soon.

Before you spread conspiracies-like things here or things you cant provide evidence for, just think a second time about it.

You can't just say: ""it must be manipulated, because it's a Parteinahe Stiftung"". Statistics and studies must stay on scientific ground or they get fucked from critics.

Manipulation in statistics, especially those big and costly ones is not really wanted, because the political enemy could easily out-perform such studies.

Example: Reichtumsbericht der Bundesregierung. Criticisms went like that: [click](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/faktencheck-zur-bundesbank-studie-private-haushalte-und-ihre-finanzen-a-890877.html)

If the Ebert Stiftung would try similiar things, then the media would do a Verriss. Especially the conservative ones, because.. you know... they are political enemies.

&gt;Oh, ad hominem.

Yeah, and your argumentation about the Manipulation trough the Ebert stiftung? It's an Ad Hominem (bias ad hominem) as well, it only refers to the whole people behind the social democratic idea (or party). it's the same principle ;)

Seems like they want a clean place ""zum nulltarif"". Sorry, but if cleaning is ""too costly"" with those cheap wages at the moment, then i call bullshit about that.

The janitors work like everyone else too. They have a tough work and they have to fucking get a reasonable wage. Slavery was abolished long time ago. I won't accept slavery in a modern coat.

I say: If the guys at this office didnt give a shit about the dirty office, they shouldn't complain either, because the problem is the unwillingness to pay a person her justified wage. 

The problem is: the work is there and workers are there too. I don't think such situations like a dirty workplace are getting tolerated for long. The employes will form resistance at one time.

I agree that your argumentation has a point, but i think it won't outcome as that. There won't be dirty offices because the Dienstleistungen are more costly.

&amp;gt; I wholeheartly agree. Now ... why don't the communes have the money for keeping the streets in a respectable fashion? 

I know, that at least in the Saarland, the Bundesland ""stole"" the communities like 100Million€.

But speaking from whole germany, I would say the problem is the constantly indebtness. The communes just don't come out from alone.

Guess it would help to re-regulate the spreading of money under Bund, Land and Kommune.

Also, we must get the communes out of that Teufelskreis.

&amp;gt;I think you will have a hard time finding a place in Germany that has not those basic utilities. Internet is a problem, though. 

Yeah, but the other ones have to be serviced as well. And speaking from electricity, there have to be more investitions for the Energiewende.

&amp;gt;I think it's essentially a voter's sympathy grab.

No, not really. It will pay off in the future, preconditioned that other actions take place as well.

Edit:

Also a Mindestlohn would end the situation that imported foreign Dienstleister are out performing german workers.

Sergey Brin (I guess Google can be considered Media - right?) - founder of google

Mark Zuckerburg - I don't need to say who this guy is.

Mortimer Zuckerman - Some publisher for a Jewish magaizine or some shit.

Steven Spielberg - yep - he's jewish.  

Jeff Zucker - head of NBC (okay, this is probably the first jewish guy who is a real media mogul and we're about 3/5 of the way through)

Haim Saban - never heard of him, and all they say here is that he's a media giant.  Okay. 

Well, that's it - according to Israel those are the important Jews in media.  Not really that large if you ask me.  I mean it's enough but not enough to support a claim that all news is Jewish propaganda.

There is a good deal of Jewish political influence on the United States listed here - many of the American financial, domestic and international policy leaders are listed here as Jewish.

In addition, there are suspicions about even more careless ""voting"" in these retirement hopes which I qualified right from the start as suspicions. Based on evidence of a relative who was nurse / care-giver in such homes and / or knows people there.

And yes, the ties between especially the catholic church and CDU / CSU have been exceptionally close. There is a reason the churches didn't tell people to vote SPD.

He says that there will be a difference.  Empires of old were formed through force with a central diktat at the core.  He said it would be 'the First Non-Imperial Empire'.  Only federalism is being forced through with the crisis of opportunity.  People are being told that there is no alternative to ever closer integration.  Lisbon was most definitely forced through - they didn't even give MEPs time to read it before voting.  They overturned referendums.  Tell Greece or Cyprus, where the common currency has been frozen, that there is no central diktat in the Troika.

So that's how it will work, out of the mouth of the President of the Commission himself.  Just like other Empires have worked before it.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2Ralocq9uE

To answer your specific question of what it will look like, the Spinelli Group which campaigns for European Federalism describes a post-national Federal Europe.

          ""Our goal is a federal and post-national Europe, a 
           Europe of the citizens. This was the dream the 
           founding fathers worked so hard to achieve. This 
           was the project of Altiero Spinelli. This is the Europe 
           we will go for. Because this is the Europe of the 
           future.""

On the wall's of the European Parliament's visitors centre sits [THIS](https://twitter.com/DanHannanMEP/status/339737335644184576/photo/1).  How the hell does that even come to  appear on a European Parliament building wall?

So yes, most definitely a post-national Europe with borders little more than administrative zones is the goal, and all that comes with it.  Federal taxes, common economic policy, consolidated debt, a single European military.  Big government, no national sovereignty; tax revenue going from the most efficient and transparent to the most corrupt and wasteful.  

The *EPP* support it, Barroso's *S&amp;D*, Verhofstadt's *ALDE*.  The three largest voting blocs, but the same mandate isn't relfected in the electorate.  It doesn't make any difference what domestic politicians say. If their party belongs to one of those blocs, then that is what they're moving to.  That is how they vote in Europe.  That is what their goals and aims are.  In the UK that means Labour (S&amp;D) and the Lib Dems (ALDE).  Everybody that is against Federalism being forced on people and loss of national identity, in every country, should know which blocs their domestic political parties belong to

As a starting point for your enquiries, you should contact the Bundesverwaltungsamt and ask them for a release of all information they have on archive regarding your grandfather.

Whether or not you have a claim to German citizenship through him depends on when he was naturalized into his post-German nationality and how this interacts with the modification of the Reichsstaatsbürgergesetz from November 1941 which automatically stripped all Jews of German citizenship.

In sostanza prima fai un lavoro che non c'entra nulla con la tua carriera professionale e poi ""se mi gira inizio a farti fare gavetta nella tua carriera"".
L'imprenditore italiano si sente in diritto di trattare il lavoratore come una sorta di iniziato ad una setta, dove per fare il tuo lavoro prima devi partire dal pulire le maniglie delle porte, il tutto ringraziando.
C'è un po di tutto in questa mentalità, sicuramente molto si ricollega a quanto costi avere un dipendente e a quanto siano alti i costi per la sola esistenza di un'azienda(e molto altro), ma detto questo c'è tutto un sottobosco culturale che fa riferimento ad una ""idolatria della sofferenza"".

In pratica è giusto che si soffra, che ""ci si rompa la schiena"", che ""sia facciano sacrifici"", ecc....il che può sembrare corretto ad un primo sguardo ma il problema sta nello scopo.
La sofferenza è cosa buona e giusta fissato uno scopo, nel senso che vale la pena di soffrire per qualche motivo, in italia invece è necessario soffrire per la sofferenza in se stessa, come fosse un debito da pagare.
La sofferenza viene vissuta come un espiazione meritata, coloro che la evitano sono definiti malamente a seconda di un motivo per la quale li si possa attaccare, anche se a seconda del motivo si entra in contraddizione:

-vai all'estero? esterofilo, codardo, traditore, ecc...

-non lavori? sfaticato, pigro, ecc...

-lavori ma non vivi da solo? bamboccione, viziato, cocco di mamma, ecc...

-lavori, vivi da solo ma non hai famiglia? egocentrico, menefreghista, egoista, eterno bambino, ecc...

-hai una laurea? ""e allora? chi ti credi di essere? conta l'esperienza!""

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"""Federal Europe"" is of course the bogeyman in the eurosceptics' armoury, as per WobbleWagon's post - totally wrong in every way, doomed to failure but kept alive through malevolent stupidity and the machinations of some shadowy group of federalists. Some people certainly support *a* federal Europe, but the 'federal Europe' of the eurosceptics is a federal Europe I think *nobody* supports. As such, it won't happen, and can be dismissed as pretty much a scare tactic.

When considering a 'federal Europe', you have to understand that the EU Treaties are written and agreed by the Member States, so a vote for the eurosceptic bogeyman of dissolved nation-states is a negotiated agreement by every single government in the EU to dissolve itself and its nation. That's not going to happen this side of a nuclear war or pandemic that reduces every nation in Europe to shreds.

The EU is already partly a federal entity, for policy areas where the following are true:

1. policy area is fully an EU competence
2. there are no national vetoes
3. the Parliament is full involved

Obviously that's true of a number of areas already, so the most likely form of a completely federal Europe can be worked out by extrapolating those further, and assuming all policy areas become EU competences. The nation states won't dissolve, nor lose their national legislatures or governments. The latter will still be voting on the Council, which will be, as it is, the senior chamber in the EU bicameral system. The former would exercise some control over their government's policy actions in Europe as they currently control their policy actions domestically - this is a major evolutionary step, because very few national legislatures have a proper mechanism for doing so.

The job of the *European* Parliament, on the other hand, is not to exercise control over specific national governments, so they will continue in their current role of allowing a channel for popular Europe-wide opposition to the Council and Commission. Note that that's not the same as control over, because the job of legislatures is not to 'control' a government in the sense of determining what it does, but to oppose the government where the government wants something unpopular - a good recent example was ACTA.

So, if we're looking at realistic options rather than fantasies, what you get is a federal Europe that looks very much like the current EU, but with every area of policy decided jointly, with a powerful European Parliament, quite likely with the Commission downgraded to a civil service role with its power of initiative taken away and given to the Council (although the Council will not be able to ignore the Parliament's demands for legislation), and with national legislatures primarily concerned with controlling their government's actions in Europe and working over the detail of domestic implementing legislation. National borders and institutions remain, but with a different focus and degree of power.

""250 more employed Lithuanians"" argument is false. E.g. When you need a sofa, you go and buy a sofa. You are not going to buy more sofas just because there is ikea. If you are going to buy it at ikea from now on, then shops A, B and C where you used to buy sofas before are going to close and fire their staff. Thus from economic point of view the benefits for Lithuania are not so obvious.
P.S. it is not that I disapprove it",0,1376504511,null,0,false,0,cbnp2w2,t3_1kcn1u,t1_cbnp2w2,t1_cbno22b,null,1429830468,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0
true,Aberfrog,ASTR,Austria,"the sentencing is not harsh in any way i would say. 

And about drunk driving : If you just drive drunk without hitting anyone or anything - big fine. you loose your license and thats it. if you get caught again you might not be allowed to have a license at all anymore. but no jail if you dont hurt / damage anyone. 

stealing is more tricky : Depending on what you steal and so on. But as far as i know - if its a first offence and you just steal a perfume or something you generally dont end up in prison. you get a fine - generally in form of ""x times what you earn on a day"" - if you cant pay that you might end up in prison after all. 

Sentencing is generally done in context with the severity of the crime. ",0,1376504529,null,0,false,0,cbnp35r,t3_1kcb55,t1_cbnp35r,t1_cbnoirk,null,1429830464,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

The city itself is very Spanish, but it doesn't seem very clean. I went there this year and was happy to leave after 2 hours. Saw some pretty dodgy looking people there and the coffee shops felt dirty.

However, the ""resorts"" around Torrevieja are more pleasant. There's nothing special about them, but they are very practical. All sorts of decent restaurants at good prices, lots of shopping to do, but the beaches are weak and you can't get around much without a car and the public transport is awful.

Again...Torrevieja in itself, if someone bought me a house there, I would not take it. Or, I'd sell it as quickly as possible.",0,1376504632,null,0,false,0,cbnp4pt,t3_1kckwp,t1_cbnp4pt,t1_cbno0b6,null,1429830443,1,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,1
