The Romans decided to call us Scoti, which means 'raiders', in essentially the same disparaging way that Vikings got their name. To be fair, we practically 'humble brag' about kidnapping St. Patrick. Scoti didn't originally refer to a tribe but the native Britons and post Romans continued to refer to the Irish Dal Riada on their terrority as Scoti and so that stuck for them-over-there when subsequently classicism reapplied the old Greek (but now suspiciously Spanish) Hibernia name. Ierne is an Irish romanticism version of this that eventually lent itself to, finally, 'Ireland' and 'Eireann' at roughly the same time.

&gt;Hungarians are called alternatively Unguri and Maghiari.

Nuance: *Ungur* can mean both ethnic Hungarians, and, more specifically, Hungarians from Hungary. *Maghiari* is usually just the former.

Also: *Galezi* - *Welsh* (because *Tara Galilor*, Gaul's country = Wales)

*Letoni* - Latvians

Old ethnonims:

*Leşi* - now abandoned in favor of *Polonezi*

*Tăut* - Slovak (regionally, in Transylvania, from the Hungarian ""Toth"")

Bear in mind, the reputation is not that important for german universities. You won't get a job because you attended uni x and you won't not get a job because you attended uni y.

Following Universities have a good reputation for mechanical engineering: RWTH Aachen, KIT Karlsruhe, TU München, TU Dresden, TU Darmstadt (this list is not complete, for sure there are some i forgot)

Following universities have a good rep for supporting foreign students, according to [this](http://www.che-ranking.de/cms/?getObject=987&amp;getLang=de) report (third table, second row): TU Braunschweig, TU Darmstadt, TU Dortmund, TU Clausthal

You should also know if you want to go to a University or a [Fachhochschule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fachhochschule).

Almost everywhere in germany, you don't have to pay tuition fees except a service charge of about 80-120€ per semester which often includes a ticket for local bus/tram/train.

I don't know if you are entitled to BaFöG Money. This is a loan you get if your parents can't afford it to send you to university. It usually is not enough, so you will have to work a few hours a week, too - but this should be no problem to do at the university. Looking for a job as ""HiWi"" (student assistant) at one of the chairs would be the way to go.

The [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/deutschland/en/) will be able to help you with everything you need and you'll find many information there.

If you have more questions, feel free to pm me! Good luck, but have in mind: engineering in germany is quite hard.

The French never claimed Roman ancestry.

It even continues to this day through the theory of daco-roman continuity currently being taught in schools. 

The fact of the matter is, we don't know how the Romanians came to be. However, giving the numerous ammount of migratory peoples that came and settled in the area that is now modern Romania after Aurelian abandoned the province of Dacia and the fact that the Romanians are so close genetically to their neighbours it's pretty obvious what ethnic group they belong to and I don't understand why they choose to ignore their heritage with such fervor apart from outright racism.

You'll probably won't get the same quality as if you were in your hometown, because there you've met different dealers and you've experimented with different qualities. But after all, you'll be here only for a few days so I guess everyone can make the effort of not smoking premium quality hash.

If you decide to take the risk put the drugs into a separate handbag isolated from the rest without any information about yourself, of course. If things go bad and your bus gets registered at the border it will be hard to relate the drugs with you (I recommend also not to talk about this strategy to any of your friends to prevent inconvenient leaks).

Other peripheral countries would see the recovery and also look to do the same to pull their countries out of the current depression they are in (Greece, Spain, Portugal).

This is already part of the system of the EU with the so-called ""Principle of Subsidiarity"". It's not defined and permanent, however. The general idea is that everything that can be done on national level is done on national level, and everything that doesn't really work on that level is done by the EU.


(2) Bicameral Legislature:

We already have a bicameral legislature. The lower house is the European Parliament, the upper house the Council of the European Union (formerly Council of Ministers). While they are both **somewhat** proportional (not really, but a little bit), there is no equality of number of votes anywhere, and I hope that never ever happens. Small countries are disproportionately well represented in the European Parliament, in the Council and in the Commission. Germany has far (FAR!) less MPs per capita than small countries.


(3) Electoral College:

No. The Electoral College doesn't balance the will of states. And neither does ""give all your votes to the winner"" have anything to do with the Electoral College. People set those two equal all the time, but they're not. States in the US may decide by themselves how they distribute their votes in the Electoral College. And please no ""winner takes all"" system in European elections, it sucks. 


(4) Military:

""State Defense Forces"", haha. Those are the national militaries. They won't go away anytime soon. The question is whether we will get an EU-wide military... But the EU President, if there is gonna be one, would very likely not have as much power as the US President does. Especially in war, the whole Commander In Chief stuff, wouldn't happen in Europe.

In terms of human capital, the influx of over seven million refugees between 1945 and 1961 provided a huge advantage in the economy, as did later policies relating to Turkish migrant workers.

The counter-argument is that Germany has ""bailed out"" a number of other EU members, and that added to its debt.

&gt;Italy would see a sharp recovery

Again quite a prophecy - you'll probably refer to Argentina but it also has to be said in this case that they actually chose a very good time to default because they restarted in a world economy that was booming massively. And whether Argentina is back on its feet is quite difficult to ascertain. [Here's a Telegraph piece on the subject](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/jeremywarner/100015225/argentinas-never-ending-trajedy/) just to avoid any pro EU media bias. The article basically says that Argentina avoided serious structural reform and chose defaulting instead = postponing the issue some 20 years (with a lot of hurt during that time).

Italy's Lira would resurface in the midst of a world economy that is only slowly recovering. So I find it difficult to predict whether they'll experience a steep or not so steep return to their current standards. And in the long run you can argue that the pressure for reform would only be postponed, the country still running a budget deficit, and basically you'd let the next generation deal with the problems.

That's my prophecy at least

In higher socioeconomic circles, however, there *is* indeed a sense of commonality in European cultures (mostly because — well, everything comes from somewhere else, and this becomes plainly obvious once you learn about art, history, culture, foreign places, and education is a marker of higher socioeconomic status). These might consider Europe 'superior', especially against Americans, which I suspect is mostly an inferiority complex bred from the loss of European hegemony in the 20th century.

Completely agreed.

42 Bonhomme a écrit le 12 mars 2013 à 13 h 13 min France A 2006 study found that the share of immigrants has a positive and significant impact on the crime rate, confirming that a larger share of immigrants is associated with a higher crime rate. The data implies that this may be caused by the higher unemployment, and thus worse socioeconomic conditions among immigrants. However, unemployed immigrants are still much more likely to commit crimes than unemployed non-immigrants.[22] Ebauche de traduction : Une étude datant de 2006 a mis en évidence que la proportion d’immigrants avait un impact significatif sur le taux de criminalité, confirmant ainsi que plus la proportion d’immigrants est importante, plus le taux de criminalité est élevé. Les données impliquent, par ailleurs, que la cause peut être un taux de chômage élevé, qui aurait comme conséquence directe des conditions socio-économiques plus mauvaises parmi les immigrants. Cependant, les immigrants au chômage sont plus susceptibles de commettre des crimes, que les autochtones dans la même situation.""

I don't know if we have the same definition of the words ""Nazi"" or ""Supremacist"".

If you are asking if there is a racial component in Catalan Nationalism. The answer is clearly no, at least not a significant one that I've ever heard of (and they have enough enemies willing to bring that up). For example, Basque Nationalism, in its origins **(late 19th Century)**, had more obvious racist ideas (importance of blood purity, a superior Basque ""race"", moral degeneration of Spaniards, etc). I support the right to decide though I'm not a fan of Nationalism by no means. However, Catalan Nationalism has always tried to find a conciliatory stand and avoided confrontation as much as possible.

On the other hand, Catalan Nationalism has grown in power and exposure during the last few decades since the arrival of Democracy. Nationalists have been in charge of Catalonia since 1980 except during the Socialist governments (2003-2010), and that includes, among **many** other things, changes in Educational Policy, which included language inmersion: ""bwahaha, we will have your children"" *(evil nationalist laughter)*. So, if the question is whether Starbuck's has catalan signs, the answer is yes. Will they have any problem to attend you in Spanish or, depending on the location, English? Not at all. Has it anything to do with Supremacism or (heck) Nazism? Well... I think it's pretty obvious it has nothing to do.

If you are asking if there is extremist media fueling this kind of rhetoric. Well, yes. When discussing these topics, you will always find people labelling the opponent's view as Fascist (and he/she will consequently call you a Fascist for questioning their ideas).",0,1363262298,null,0,1363262534,0,c8vfhvz,t3_1a9t8f,t1_c8vfhvz,t3_1a9t8f,null,1431581838,2,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,2

Tu fais en revanche très bien de préciser qu'il y a un écart certain entre une extrême droite riche, bien plus pensante et théoricienne, et une extrême droite pauvre, où le racisme et l'intolérance sont souvent dûs à une proximité, un écart de culture, des abus (ouais, tu vois, je ne fais pas d'angélisme), et un manque de compréhension mutuelle qui renforce la méfiance et mène à ce type de pensée. Surtout dans le climat vaguement islamophobe qui s'installe progressivement en Europe, soutenu de manière plus ou moins molle par nombre de médias.

C'est donc un travail de propagande qui n'a strictement rien à foutre sur ce support, et doit donc être surveillé, vérifié, et le cas échéant, supprimé. D'autres supports existent pour cela.

Now this applies both to some Catalanist movements as much as it does to the ""unified Spain"" movement, which advocates from a nationalistic point of view that we ALL should be spaniards and speak spanish. Specifically in Cataluña I can tell you that there is more than one nationalistic party, and that they diversify between Esquerra per Cataluña - Verts (Lefts for Catalonia - Green party) and Convergencia I Unio (Convergence and Union); the latter just from the name you can assume is more of a right wing kind of thing.

I'm a spaniard from Madrid. In general I can tell you that most people here won't care one bit that catalonians speak catalan and that they teach it, or that they have their own police force and specific laws (they manage their own justice and healthcare as opposed to the ""federal"" rest of spain).

Remembering the first Orbán govt and also the first ""free"" govt in 1990-94 it was obvious that the ""old networks"" (former commies and their liberal allies who effectively became the symbionts of these networks despite their anti-communist past) mentioned by shenpen were interested in the fall of these govts. They controlled most media outlets, and so effectively shaped public opinion blaming the rightist govts for everything, and ridiculing them at every opportunity.
So it's not suprising that Fidesz came to the conclusion that without breaking this informal network it can't get anything done and even if they win an election they can't win again because of them.
But you are right that they aren't inherently better than the ""other mafia"" at all. Thing is that we already have two corrupt elites in different colors, the one in opposition is now making desperate efforts to frustrate the other's plans to win the next election by pulling the strings abroad, which is easy as the Orbán govt has made some powerful foreign enemies (banks, Geman and French owned utility companies who were heavily taxed in the past 2 years etc.)",0,1363265327,null,0,1363266448,0,c8vfy2h,t3_1a3itm,t1_c8vfy2h,t1_c8uwirt,null,1431582057,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Why? Well, why would they actually want to do this? How would they do it? How much will it cost and what's the P&amp;L of it?

Let me start with the P&amp;L and with a trivial example that can be expanded on a larger scale: Italy has a lot of tourism coming from the rest of EU and its people often go on holidays in neighboring countries. Going back to the lira would mean a strain on there tourists (and business travelers)... and if I have to chose between Rome and Madrid, all things being equal except for this strain, I'll chose Madrid... there you go: €1000 less in your economy just because of that... and I won't be the only one.

The euro was implemented to ease trade between these countries and to use the ""power of many"" when it comes to exchange rates. Italy would lose all of this in a period of crisis... not really a good idea. What would it gain? Monetary independence, which is overrated anyway... since all western countries depend on the financial markets for their debt selling and this is more or less controlled by the market actors. The only thing it would gain would be more control on its exchange rates... but when loosing the stability given by the block, this control will mean that the Italian central bank (ICB) will have to pay more in a period of crisis to stabilize the rates. Just imagine that because of the current crisis the lira just lost 50% of its value against the euro (meaning the lira/EUR went from 1 to 0.5 for example). This will cost a lot the importers, it will have dire consequences to the consumers and the Italian people... this is where the ICB has to intervene: it will use its euro reserves to buy lire on the markets to stabilize these rates and not kill all businesses. But in order to do this, it needs euros, which it will have to borrow. 

Plus, there's a cost to changing currencies, and not only to print that. You'd need to change all the systems that take into account money to start using the lira again...

And I'd continue... but you get the point I hope. It won't mean armagedon, just a deeper cost. And the eurozone is not so sick as to warrant abandoning ship...",0,1363266296,null,0,false,0,c8vg46e,t3_1a9x3z,t1_c8vg46e,t3_1a9x3z,null,1431582202,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

There are more good hotels in its surroundings, but I have always thought ""Hotel Fuerte"" is the most beautiful.
There is one of the best restaurants in town, ""La Fontanilla"" (just like the beach), where you can try the local fish, fished early that morning. I recommend you ""Borriquete"", ""Pez cochino"" and ""Urta"" (this one is more expensive). Ask if they have ""almadraba"" tuna (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almadraba), it's fished locally and sustainable, an it's deliiiicious.
You may go to ""Los hermanitos"" bar too. There you may taste the traditional deep fried fish. You MUST try ""Cazón en adobo"", ""Puntillitas"" and ""Ortigas de mar"". There you'll have a taste of what local bars are.
A nice place to visit is (fuck, I forgot the name) a humble restaurant next to the harbour and the lighthouse, and on the way to the cliffs, where you must spend a day too (maybe rent a bike and discover the forests and cliffs would be a good idea). You'll recognize the restaurant because it's all surrounded by anchors. There is plenty of fish and traditional Spanish food, and it's cheap. Ask for their ""sardinas"" and ""caballa asada con priñaca"".
If you're sick of fish, we also have good beef and excellent Iberian porks. Go to ""Blanco y verde"" restaurant to taste it, grilled with Olive tree wood (excellent fish there, too).
BTW, if you are into trees (as in /r/trees), Conil is one of the places where most of the ""hachís"" of Southern Europe enters, it's something you'll only find in Morocco.
The big problem about Conil is the wind, but we have a solution for that. There are two main winds, ""Levante"" (comes from the east, very hot, dry and usually blowing hard) and ""Poniente"" (comes from the west, colder and more humid, usually calm). Manyb days being at the beach is a nightmare, but those are ideal days to go to the cliffs. Ask if the wind is ""Poniente"" or ""Levante"": if it's ""Levante"", go to the cliffs next to the lighthouse, they are wind-free. If it's ""Poniente"", go to ""Cala del Aceite"", next to the harbour. It's Poniente-free.
Also, if you are into scuba diving, Conil is a great place to dive.
If you want more advice, just PM me or leave a comment, i'm glad you chose Conil for your honeymoon and I wish you a great honeymoon and a marriage full of love.

Tout est résumé dans l'introduction de [cette étude](http://www.icclr.law.ubc.ca/Publications/Reports/MigrationAndCrime.pdf) :

&gt;Indeed, asserting that there is a strong
connection between crime and immigration is all too often done for political purposes: to
exploit a community's xenophobic fears or to play on a group's natural resistance to cultural
pluralism. When these two issues are combined they may add up to a powerful cocktail
of fear and irrational responses.

Je pense que la réaction de ceux qui veulent la [suppression de l'article](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discussion:Immigration_et_criminalit%C3%A9/Suppression) comme celle des fdesouche font partie des réponses irrationnelles. La page wikipedia de la version anglaise me parait pas mal. 

Pareil pour la notion de race, il vaut mieux avoir un article ""race et intelligence"" qui rappelle que ces notions sont sujettes à débat et ne sont pas scientifiques plutôt que d'avoir une page supprimée (censure).

Edit : 

&gt;C'est donc un travail de propagande qui n'a strictement rien à foutre sur ce support, et doit donc être surveillé, vérifié, et le cas échéant, supprimé.

Il suffit de mettre des études qui montrent que criminalité et immigration ne sont pas corrélées. La Corse est un bon exemple. Pour la délinquance, c'est pareil, on a pas mal de délinquance rurale. Il est donc très simple de ""neutraliser"" (au sens de rendre neutre) l'article. Par contre, ça ne fera pas disparaître l'extrême droite.

J'ai cru comprendre que les verts reprochaient aux députés européens de ne pas aller assez loin dans l'écoconditionnalité. Par exemple, la proposition des verts visant à subordonner le versement des aides à une rotation des cultures n'a pas été retenue, ce qui favorisera la monoculture. 

De même, les verts reprochent aux députés d'avoir voté un plafonnement de seulement 300 000 euros des aides versées à une même exploitation, alors qu'ils proposaient un plafonnement à 100 000 euros. Cela favorise les grosses exploitations au détriment des petites. Selon José Bové, ""les grosses exploitations continueront à éliminer les plus petites qui les entourent. C'est le feu vert au gigantisme et à une agriculture industrielle."" Le but des verts étaient, en fixant un plafonnement à 100 000 euros, de dégager des fonds pour pouvoir aider davantage les petites exploitations agricoles qui sont aujourd'hui en difficulté.

Les débats sur la PAC ne sont pas nouveaux. Il a longtemps été reproché à la PAC de suivre une logique productiviste, au détriment des préoccupations de santé publique et environnementales. De même, elle profiterait finalement à trop peu de personnes alors qu'elle représente une part très importante du budget ([selon le journal Alternatives économiques, en 2009, la PAC représentait 43% du budget européen dont bénéficie seulement 5,6% de la population active](http://www.alternatives-economiques.fr/quelle-politique-agricole-demain-_fr_art_838_43095.html)).

You're going to have to qualify this.

1. What, exactly, do you mean by ""liberal""? I don't want to defend some straw man, so we need to be clear on who we're talking about.

2. When that's done, how are they being racist?

&gt; Because you keep accusing them of racism.

No no, they don't appear to be held, is all.

&gt; No you brought it up, by being racist.

No your mom brought it up!!

Really?

&gt; You're homophobic and sexist for assuming homosexuals and women are fragile. You disgusting vile person. How dare you!?!?

… Really?

&gt; It is when you use it. You accuse all Conservatives of being racists to avoid debate.

I'd love to have a real debate, but we have to agree on some ground rules — one being that arguments stand on their own merit, not on whether or not the one who utters them is of a different race, sexuality, gender, or a ""beta male"".

&gt; Just because you are a weak and fragile man does not mean you are included in a group with women and homosexuals. You are a vile human being, how dare you stereotype people like that?

 The reality is that, with exponencial efficency and automation in producing and delivering to us what we need, much less work is needed to meet the real demand. And, because we have this paradigm of ""you need to work for a living"", we create artificial demand, and create jobs that are not needed.

Imagine the entire society as one big factory. In the beginning each would work at the factory and receive it's product, with no surplus. Then humans decided to work together and to use technology to improve production, and so a surplus was created. With this surplus, there wasn't needed as much work as before, but instead of everyone working less, some men did very little work, while managing to keep others working the same time so that they could live without working. With time, men invents robots and robots made it possible to reduce the workforce even further. But these robots don't need products, and every worker is now outside of the factory with no right to receive any of its product, because they did not work. And the owners of the robots now have no one to give the product surplus, because no one deserves it besides them.

Labour were traumatised by that election and courted him after that point. That he backed them to win the next election was seen as one of their reasons for victory. The reality is the Tories self destructed over Europe, sleaze and lecturing families on how to live their lives without holding themselves to the same standard. The formerly low income families who lifted into the middle classes under Thatcher lost money in the recession of that time and the incumbent government was blamed. Labour didn't look like they were going to throw high taxes at them and so they were trusted enough to take over.

A big number of people on the list are former politicians or majors etcetera. The list can be found [here](http://top200.volkskrant.nl/).

In the top 10 you'll find:
Bernard Wientjens. (#1 since 2010) He's the chairman of VNO-NCW, the major employers' organization. Dutch politics is all about talking and making compromises (the poldermodel), together with trade unions and the government they try to keep the country running.

Alexander Rinnooy Kan.

I think some of them do make the country better, politicians can focus so much on the ""issue of the week"", so it's good to see research institutes and other organizations with influence.

Italy by choice has no nuclear power, and it imports oil, natural gas, and raw materials at high prices, paying in euros. A return to the lira and a subsequent devaluation would make those imports even more expensive. Italian manufacturers may be able to export more goods, which would become cheaper for buyers with a strong currency, but gasoline, heating, and electricity would become extremely expensive for Italians. 
All imports in general will become more expensive: foreign cars, electronic devices, etc. Only the rich could afford to vacation abroad.

Also, the euro has helped keeping interest rates low on Italy's public debt over the years (the actual savings are difficult to calculate, but economists agree that they exist). With the lira, interest rates may increase and, given the high level of public debt, Italy could be forced to default on its internally held public debt. As a matter of fact, only 30% or 40% of the Italian public debt is in the hands of foreign investors; the rest is held by Italian investors, i.e. banks and families. Italian citizens who invested their savings in Italian government bonds would suffer huge losses.

Maybe in the long term the economy would recover, but in the short term all I see is a sharp decline in the living standards of ordinary Italians.",0,1363275829,null,0,1363286068,0,c8vim98,t3_1a9x3z,t1_c8vim98,t3_1a9x3z,null,1431583381,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

This is not a simple problem of tax evasion nor is it a problem of inefficient public corporations or a bloated public sector. If it was, then the same pattern of crisis would not repeat in all these different countries. The problem is that Greece has a weak productive capacity compared to other eurozone countries and it is impossible to compete with them on equal terms. 

My own view is that our economic system is fundamentally flawed because it incentivises an endless increase in production while at the same time does not give any leeway to economic actors that fall behind in their obligations. 

To put it simply, if you have the capacity to produce more products and services than other people, it doesn't mean that others have the means to compensate you for what you make with things of equal value. If you insist on being paid with things of equal value, then you either have to slow down production or go down the road of accepting their payment on credit. If you do the first, you enter a recession. If you do the second, your debtors will more likely than not eventually not be able to keep up with their obligations.

Die wohl inhaltlich beste deutsche Produktion in den letzten Jahren ist ""Im Angesicht des Verbrechens"" . Dabei handelt es sich um die russische Mafia in Berlin. Musst du aber schauen, ob sich die Serie für deine bisherigen Deutschkentnisse lohnt, da eben viel russischer Dialekt vorkommt.

Wenn du etwas komplett ""unamerikanisches"" haben möchtest, kann ich dir nur das ""Großstadtrevier"" und vor allem ""Neues aus Büttenwarder"" ans Herz legen. Gerade die letztere hat einen gewissen Charme, und vor allem, kommt so ulkig wie sie teilweise erscheint, doch sehr nah das liebevoll chaotische Landleben in Norddeutschland ran. 

Wenn dir klassische Comedys eher zusagen wären wie schon erwähnt ""Stromberg"", ""Mein Leben und ich"", ""Türkisch für Anfänger"" und ""Doctors Diary"" ganz passable Wahlen. Die sind nicht schlecht, werden dich aber auch nicht umhauen. Typische Mainstreamcomedy halt. Ansonsten ist ""Dittsche"" auch super, aber der Humor und die Aufmache der Sendung ist sicherlich nicht für jedermann. Falls du selbst in Deutschland lebst und daher auch (zumindest relativ) auf den aktuellen Stand bist was die Politik hier angeht, gibt es einige richtig gute Kabarett Sendungen. Allen vorweg ""Neues aus der Anstalt"". Falls du noch nie Kabarett gesehen hast und nicht weißt was du dir drunter vorstellen kannst: Quasi inhaltstechnisch sehr nah drann an beispielsweise der Dailyshow oder dem Colbert Report, aber eben ein bisschen anspruchsvoller und in einer Theaterumgebung.

I wouldn't recommend Madrid, it's huge and there are a lot of English speakers and I think it lacks personality, in my opinion. It's my least favorite place I've been in Spain.

Someone mentioned that they speak Valencian in Valencia, but when I was there I really didn't notice this as much as I did with Catalan in Barcelona. It isn't an official language and I don't think it would hinder your language-learning experience. For Spanish learning purposes, I wouldn't recommend Catalunya/Barcelona, but I would recommend Valencia. It's a great city and I really don't think Valencian will be an issue.

That said, Sevilla is a great option, not too far from the coast (a few hours drive/train ride) and it's a very welcoming city. It will be super hot in the summer though, beware. Also, Andalucia has a reputation for having a ""horrible"" accent- they eat a lot of their words and talk very fast. Some find it difficult to understand. But I have a friend who's been living in Sevilla for two years and it doesn't seem to bother her.

If you want to be in a city, I would recommend Sevilla, Valencia, and Salamanca (popular choice for college students). However, the north of Spain is always forgotten about and it is a really rich place to be, culture-wise. I would also recommend looking into Santander in Cantabria as well as somewhere a bit less well-known like Zaragoza. It really depends on what you're looking for.

I am writing concerning the statement I made to the police (at CDG-Terminal 2F, reference 095/527/270, taken by brigadier de police Stephane Maillard) regarding a suitcase stolen on the 11th of March. I appreciate the help given to me at the police station but would like to clarify a few details in the statement.

1. The report states that the suitcase was taken at Gare du Nord but it is also possible that it was taken at CDG-Terminal 1 train station, or possibly even at Les Halles where we boarded the train around 14.25.

2. Some items not mentioned in the report that may help to identify the suitcase if found: 'Chloe' sunglasses, 'Luis Vuitton' keyholder and an iPod.

Many Thanks,""

Can Italy convince its creditors to accept Lira denominations? If you can then a move can work for Italy at least.

Les femmes sont principalement victimes d'agressions par ... des proches. Des gens qu'elles aiment et qu'elles connaissent. Par contre, ceux qui sont victimes d'agressions dans la rue sont majoritairement des hommes.

L'étude est [ici](http://www.insee.fr/fr/ffc/docs_ffc/ref/FHPARIT12d_VE3quali.pdf).

Le passage :

&gt;Pour les violences physiques qui se produisent hors ménage, les hommes sont plus souvent victimes que les
femmes : 2,3 % d’entre eux ont été victimes de violences physiques en 2009 ou 2010, contre
1,9 % des femmes. Si l’on se restreint aux personnes de moins de 40 ans, qui sont les plus
concernées par ces violences, l’écart est encore plus élevé (4,3 % contre 3,3 %). À partir de
40 ans, les violences physiques hors ménage sont aussi fréquentes pour les hommes et les
femmes (1,1 % au cours des deux dernières années). Les hommes se déclarent également un
peu plus souvent victimes de vols personnels avec violence (respectivement 1,1 % et 1,0 %,
au cours des deux dernières années).

Pour les viols, [c'est pareil](http://www.contreleviol.fr/viol-en-france/10-idees-recues-sur-le-viol) : l'écrasante majorité des viols sont commis par des proches (80%).

Les viols commis sur des femmes par des inconnus (autour de 5% des viols) sont des viols de vengeance sociale : des jeunes femmes riches sont violées par des hommes pauvres, qui se vengent de leur condition sociale sur des femmes qui les rejettent. Ce n'est absolument pas un acte sexuel mais un acte de violence sociale effectué par des malades mentaux, le plus souvent marginaux.

Le débat était de savoir si le hijab représentait un symbole répréssif est misogyne et si on devais interdire un tel symbole. Si on interdisais ces symbole on était pas pour le faire juste avec les musulmans alors on a pensé se départir de tout les symboles religieux et effectivement la question se pose le Québec ayant été traditionnellement catholioque est-ce qu'on doit aussi se départir des symboles catholique. La conclusion finale c'est que tout le monde peut continuer à faire ce qu'i veut mais vous ramenez toujours ça sur le tapis.  
  
Pour ce qui est des franco-canadiens, je n'en ai jamais rencontré, ton sentiment est peut être légitime, peut-être pas je sais pas, on ne parle pas beaucoup de vous et vous ne vous faites pas beaucoup entndre non plus.  
  
Pour ce qui est de mon post je dis clairement que je suis conscient que c'est commentire sont le résultat d,une minorité, ce que je toruve inquiétant c'est que les pâtes aient provoqués un débat plus important que le fait qu'un anglo fasse une tentative d'assassinat sur les souverainiste.

El debat va ser si el hijab és un símbol és repressiva i misogin si haguéssim de prohibir un símbol. Va prohibir aquests símbols si no tingués a veure amb els musulmans només pel que pensem que disposar dels símbols religiosos i de fet es planteja la qüestió del Quebec han estat tradicionalment catholioque és que també cal desfer-se dels símbols Catòlica. La conclusió final és que tothom pugui seguir fent és el que vull, però sempre l'empeny a la catifa.

The original document in the '70s did ban anything that was not French. Bricks were thrown through windows of English owned shops, signs with English had to be covered up, etc, hence why nearly 1 million people left Quebec over three decades, as well as hundreds of companies. The law isn't just for signage, but even still it's silly as it's a store name. Signs don't have to be bilingual, but if another language is used French must be larger. It originally prevented anyone not from Quebec from going to school in English (including Anglophones from Canada), but was relaxed so they could go, but immigrants of other languages and English (from U.S., U.K., Australian) have no right to go to school in English. Companies with over 50 employees (now, it should be 26+) have to operate in French. And more. Not to mention that if there is any English anywhere, for example on signs, on buttons on appliances, art as more cases from Pastagate are coming out, that show the hostility towards English and anything non-French. 

I am on the fence about secularism. While religion should not interfere in politics, in a free society you should be allowed to express yourself religiously by wearing whatever jewel or garment you wish. But if a society wants laïcité then by all means ban everything, including the cross. By not banning the cross but everything else shows how disrespectful and intolerant the government is towards immigrants. And we don't need to get into debates about the hijab, it isn't sexist as women choose to wear it (it's not mandatory in Islam), but it would be sexist to tell women that they cannot wear certain things. But still to ban all non-Catholic symbols because one might be considered sexist is ridiculous as an excuse. People can continue with what they want only because the PQ received so much negative press for it.

Us, Franco-Ontariens, are always aware of what's going on in Quebec. A lot of media we consume is also in French or from Quebec. We don't just rely on media from other parts of Canada other than Quebec. Not to mention many of us, if not having lived here, have friends and family who do/have. We know more about Quebec than Quebec knows about us, considering Quebec often times ignores us and our existence (there are so few people who know that we even exist). Not to mention the SJB Day is actually meant for all of N. America's francophones, but Quebec hijacked it for their [own](http://www.nfb.ca/film/pis_nous_autres_dans_tout_ca/). I am not surprised about how little Quebec talks or knows about us and our lives, but we're far from oblivious.

And to blame all anglos for the attempt on Marois is silly as well, considering a Francophone tried it on [Chrétien](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Dallaire) after the OUI lost. Not to mention the [FLQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_de_lib%C3%A9ration_du_Qu%C3%A9bec) as a terrorist group that attacked, bombed, hurt and killed Anglophones. The fact that those involved were not punished severely is tragic, as what they did was horrible. And yet you blame all anglos for what one did? Ridiculous, they even denounced it, but that doesn't make you think differently.

And there is a lot of Quebec bashing on the Internet because Quebec does it to Canada way too much. Not to mention your definition of Quebec bashing is often times only criticism directed at Quebec (like Maclean's).

Just a few weeks ago in Quebec, an Italian restaurant was facing criminal charges because they had too many non-french words (like pasta and bottiglia) on their menus.  The owner won only because he was able to raise some publicity for his fight.

Another restaurant [was told](http://www.montrealgazette.com/Beef+owner+digs+into+pastagate/8007898/story.html#ixzz2NRJrKQsR) to tape over the ""redial"" and ""hold"" buttons on their phone, and to do the same for the ""ON/OFF"" button on their microwave.

&gt; The last straw? Being ordered to take down the “W.C.” sign on the washroom door. The initials, which stand for “water closet,” are commonly used to mark bathroom doors in France, Holder pointed out to the inspector.  “We’re not in France,” she reportedly replied.

Other companies have gotten in trouble because their business cards contained english, or because - while the word ""trash"" on the trash cans behind their building were painted over - they were embossed and still somewhat visible.

Companies were forced to adopt French names.  It was not voluntary; laws were passed forcing them to do so.  For a while it was illegal to have anything but French on exterior signs - including a company that previously had ""Hello"" in dozens of languages.  Now the French must be twice as large as the other language.  You face criminal charges if you do not comply.

There was the war on apostrophes, which required Eaton’s to become Eaton. More recently there was the Montreal restaurant forced to add an ‘e’ to the end of its vintage neon Tavern sign to make the name French and the Irish pub that had to fight to keep its antique Guinness posters.

Language police have [told employees](http://archives.vigile.net/ds-actu/docs3/03-5-30-1.html) of private companies that if they fail to pass a french course, they'd lose their jobs.

Except for the fact that Quebec is a have-not province that's debt is rising faster than any other province, and companies are reluctant to invest much in Quebec both due to separatism or because Bill 101 requiring them to operate only in French and to change signs. It's why alcohol, technology, among other things and businesses are not available only in Quebec. Not to mention that a sizable population and companies left, reducing the amount of money being produced to very little and there being a serious shortage of jobs available. Even now Quebec receives more in welfare, with the government promising to make jobs for people in smaller towns/cities so that people wouldn't have to leave to work (Charest wanted to make jobs but it would have forced long commutes or relocation). Quebec doesn't have a strong economy at all, and despite increasing taxes can barely look after itself. Not to mention Quebec gets huge sums from the government (it is a myth that Quebec would have more money if it didn't have to send any to Ottawa, considering Quebec receives 150% back of what it contributes).

No one keeps us from doing it, but it has been taken over by Quebec as celebrating Quebec, and not N.American francophones. It was only briefly in the '60s that French schools were shutdown, but we fought for our rights and now it's guaranteed in public money (we have public money for French public and catholic schools, like English public and catholic). And it isn't illegal to teach in French, and there aren't any assimilation projects going on in Canada, which shows how little you know about us. The Federal government, in fact, as no jurisdiction over us, but it's provincial.

That sounds like such a ridiculous conspiracy theory. It was proven that it was the FLQ who bombed those institutions and places, and kidnapped MNAs (or MPs, whatever their position was) and killed one. Not to mention it was Pierre Trudeau who was from Quebec who declared martial law to arrest the FLQ. What ridiculous person would suggest that he would do such a thing to attack his own home?

They've made issue with Bain, following his courtcase and denouncing him and and any anglo who would have wanted him to succeed. But things the OQLF does like Pastagate are more common and recent, with many businesses (English, French, Allo) coming forward to air what the OQLF is doing to them. Rather, French media doesn't advertise enough what the OQLF does because they don't want to draw criticism to an organisation they and their readers support, even if it's true. It's only in ridiculous things like Pastagate that they get on board. But what's odd is how French media, parrotted by its followers, seem to blame English media for Richard Bain, when he was a crazy lunatic much like André Dallaire.

Pay closer attention to your media because televised and journal news, as well as internet, attack and bash Canada. Bashing goes back and forth, but not every thing that you describe as ""Quebec bashing"" *is* Quebec bashing, but is rather well-warranted criticism.

They do not have the right to stop you any longer than that, though they have to be able to be certain that they collected the correct personal data, meaning they likely won’t be happy with you just telling them something. I guess they would want to see something like your ID card or a driver’s license or something similar.

If you refuse to show them that or can’t show them that, they will likely just call the police and hold you until they arrive. They definitely can’t keep you for extended periods of time without doing something like collecting your data or calling the police. Using some force (i.e. grabbing your arm to stop you from getting away) is very probably also appropriate here (more or less as much as is needed to stop you from getting away).

Now, this a conservative interpretation of the law. It’s very likely correct, but there are some subtle points about the law. Those who check your ticket don’t have some special policing rights. They have the same right as every other private person to hold you and that right is quite limited.

How is it limited? There has to be an urgent or immediate suspicion that you committed a crime. That’s a pretty high barrier, actually. They have to catch you in the act of committing the crime, more or less.

If you catch a burglar in your living room, for example, you can hold them until the police arrives, since there is quite obviously an immediate suspicion. However, the mall cop cannot hold you just because your are sweating and look around nervously and refuse to show them what’s in your pockets. If they do that they risk committing a crime, actually.

I would, however, argue that refusing to show your ticket is more than enough to establish immediate suspicion.",0,1363292190,null,0,false,0,c8vodk6,t3_1aawhf,t1_c8vodk6,t3_1aawhf,null,1431586166,21,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,21

And you have it right there in the first paragraph this anit-quebecois sentiment that tries to depict us as lazy bums. Quebec is 27th in terms of PIB per capita in the world, 3rd for the IDH. There are no statistics that links Quebec's economy with bill 101 and separatism it's just a tool used by federalist to scare people. Compagnies operate in different language all over the world, it's a false debate. The unemployement rate is at  7.1% canadas is at 7.4 and remember we're speaking in a subreddit where the unemployement rate is at 22%.  
  
The debpt is abviously a problem but we have a strong econmy based on renewable ressources like hydro-electricity if we ever have to much debpt we culd always provatise hydro-quebec which is worth hundreds of billions (134 to be precise)  
  
eualization payment. I'm so sick of this stupid argument. Yes we recieve equalisation payment. But it's not directly from alberta to QQc, the equalization program is a program to the same extend as the army, we all contribute to it all quebecers contribute que the equalization program. Than it is splited, I don't know how. But anyhow we get roughly 4 billion more to the federal than what we get. But we have the lowest .
One thing you have to understand also is that lets say there's 1 province that produce a lot of oil, oil il have a direct influence on the value of the dollar. So lets say alberta produce a shit load of petrol, the dollar rises to 1.15. Pretty could for albertans they get to sell their crap and there's no problem. But for the provinces that dont make petrol this dlloar rise have a negative effect on the exports. So the production of oil is directly linked to the value of our money which is directly linked to our export, which is why there is an equalization program, Are you getting all that?
The equalization payment is also calculated with the number of resident of each province, the quebec is the province that gets the less equalization payment per capita after ontario (of all the province that receive equalization payments) thats why most of it goes to Qc, because there 300 fucking ppl on PEI!!

Some courses in the later years were also in English.

Sadly, this has been discontinued. Sometimes I wonder how smaller countries such as the Netherlands or Sweden can have programs like this, but in Germany they get shot down. Should be worth a try to search for a program like this in mechanical engineering though.

If a German actually meets a Texan, chances are the impression will be very positive.

- Ce ne sont pas des fonds contenant uniquement des matières premières agricoles. Si vous prenez par exemple l'indice ""Easy ETF S&amp;P GSCI Ultra Light Energy"" cité dans l'article, il contient par exemple 23% d'énergie, 17% de métaux industriels et 9% de métaux précieux. Ce sont tout simplement des fonds qui sont conseillés par des gestionnaires de patrimoine comme fond de portefeuille (1% des investissements). Ils servent principalement à se couvrir contre la hausse des prix des dépenses courantes de personnes qui ont un gros patrimoine. Ce n'est pas précisé par leur étude.

- les banques n'ont pas tout le temps les moyens de connaitre la motivation finale d'un investissement d'un client. Comme le précise l'article, ces investissements ont été conçus pour répondre à un besoin naturel de l'économie à la base mais peuvent avoir été un peu déviés dans leur utilisation.

En fait, j'ai l'impression qu'on n'insiste pas assez sur ce qui est vraiment répréhensible, à savoir la manipulation de cours. C'est ce point qui peut faire varier artificiellement des prix sur un marché essentiel pour l'humanité. On se rappelle par exemple des tankers pleins de pétrole bloqués au large des cotes pour gonfler les prix de l'essence à une époque.

Por ejemplo, ""rotunda"" en lugar de ""rotonda"" (roundabout), ""pompa"" en lugar de ""surtidor de gasolina"" (gas pump), ""anti"" en lugar de ""tita"" (auntie), etc.
Ellos pagan muy pocos impuestos, por lo que el tabaco, el alcohol y la gasolina, entre otras cosas, son muy baratas. Eso hace que mucha gente visite Gibraltar para comprar estos productos. También tienen algunos productos ingleses que no podemos encontrar en España (chocolate Cadbury, mantequilla mejor que la española, etc.).

Data sources and methods 

This report is based on the European Survey on Alcohol and Health that was a part of 
the Global Survey on Alcohol and Health. The survey was sent to all Member States 
in July 2008. The 69 questions of the questionnaire were divided into three sections. 
Section A addressed alcohol policy; Section B addressed alcohol consumption and 
Section C addressed health consequences. 
In addition to the data collected, other sources of data were utilized in the preparation of 
this report and the country profiles. These included surveys and other studies conducted 
in the respective countries, mainly from published peer-reviewed journal articles and 
official reports, and in some cases grey literature such as conference papers and 
reports found on the internet. For the data on alcohol consumption, several sources 
were utilized. Official data on recorded adult (15+) per capita consumption (APC) 
supplied by the respective member states were given a priority. If these data were not 
available, data from alcohol industry statistics in the public domain were used. In 
some cases, when these data were either not consistently available or not reliable, data 
supplied by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations’ statistical 
database (FAOSTAT) were utilized. 
Individual country profiles were prepared in an attempt to give an overview of the 
current situation regarding alcohol and health in WHO Member States. This was 
achieved on the basis of a select number of key indicators chosen by a group of 
experts. The profiles were validated by representatives from the individual countries 
who attended WHO Regional Consultation Meetings in April 2009. In November the 
country profiles were sent to the governments for endorsement. This report is only 
based on data available in the country profiles. ",0,1363301476,null,0,1363301947,0,c8vrkxr,t3_1aa6wq,t1_c8vrkxr,t1_c8vmd1a,null,1431587677,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

&gt; Brendan Smith, the agriculture minister, announced yesterday that the government would use European Union funding to buy 53 tonnes of fresh Irish cheddar and distribute it for free from 15 November.

&gt;But Irish citizens responded angrily to the plan, which was likened to the ""Let them eat cake"" comment by Marie Antoinette that provoked the French revolution. 

&gt;The cheese will be distributed via collection centres in towns and cities across Ireland. Mr Smith said the plan was ""an important means of contributing towards the well-being of the most deprived citizens in the [EU] community"". 

 &gt;The initiative is funded by the EU's food aid programme, which has been running since 1987 in reaction to a particularly cold winter.

true,BonanzaCreek,null,null,"The Slavs are most definitely an ethnic group. However, you are right in pointing out that the ethnicity by itself doesn't actually mean a lot since there are noticeable differences between the peoples who are collectively known as the Slavs. That's why there are inter-ethnic classifications used to differentiate between them. For example, the Czech, Polish and Slovakian peoples are considered West Slavic whereas the Bulgarians alongside the Serbs, Croatians, Bosniaks etc. are South Slavic. 

These classifications are made based on the similarities between historical backgrounds, languages and cultures. You cannot deny that the romanians are very close in terms of culture and history to the Southern Slavs. My problem is that the notions by which the romanians try to distinguish themselves from their southern slavic neighbours are not based on historical fact and are quite arbitrary. 

Giving that by all accounts romanians are a Southern Slavic people it is quite bewildering to me that they choose to reject this notion, trying instead to diferentiate themselves as much as possible from their slavic neighbours. For example, history classes teach romanians that they are descended from latinized dacians when this is simply not true. To me at least, all these attempts at individualizing the romanian people comes off as borderline racist.

""Sexualisation"" in this context means, approximately, awakening or encouraging a person's sexual feelings and desires. Porn definitely does promote sexualisation, but then so does damn near everything outside of a convent (and maybe not even that), and porn is probably a far smaller factor than general social attitudes.

There is a widespread view that people having any kind of sexuality before 16 or 18 is a bad thing, and that we must therefore prevent children and teenagers being exposed to anything which might awaken their sexuality. It is also widely believed that teenagers are becoming sexualy active earlier, although the opposite seems to actually be the case for middle-class teenagers who get away with far less today than they did in the 60s because of tighter parental and external controls (for example, schools actively preventing kissing and even hugging, let alone other activities which in the past were more likely to be tolerated if discreet).

But it says that for that year there was an income of 1.5 billion, a net loss of  1.7 billion, the money given to the 22000 workers were 1.2 billion (almost 50k a year on average, even cardiologists wouldn't make that kind of money in Greece). 

The rest of the loss was cause anyone in those companies with a high enough rank and a friend in some supposedely private but really part of the overall system, supplier / contractor / construction company, or maybe even a friend at a bank, could loan huge amounts of money in the name of the greek state and then steal them just like that without bothering to complete the project. 

In other areas such as Health Care, I heard some physicians saying that since Karamanlis got elected the overall cost of the public health system got to the same level as that of Spain (which has 4x times our population). Did the services improve? Not really they'd buy supplies no one needed under the guise of the greek state and then they'd might even resell them in Bulgaria for extra profit. Or how about some posh clinic (that couldn't find enough customers) using their connections to get the public sector to send patients and then pay for them? Or even just making things up, as in, declare that each patient got admitted 4 times instead of 1, depending on your connections and your grafting ability, no one is going to check

The public sector is crazy, you'd lose your mind there, they tangle the responsibilites on purpose, install complex and never ending beaurocratic and legal procedures, have a myriad of hidden loopholes they exploit, and the end result is they get all their cousins to the 3rd degree hired for salaries 4 times that of the private sector plus the most ""la moglie"" of them might go for the loan as the greek state scam. And then they'll be like ""I only make 1200 euros a month"" (excluding 25 different bonuses that I won't mention) ""I am a socialist"" (even Karl Marx would throw his hands in the air with some of those people).

And I don't think it has to do with Greece not being able to produce, Germany after the WW2, or Korea, or Israel, or any other European country that had been ""a sick man"", and most of them had, they all didn't produce at some time, but did bounce back. ""Greece isn't able to produce"" inevitably leads back to ""conspiracy against Greece"", and I don't think that's the way the world works anymore. We 've got the same level universities as in Europe, there are quite a few industries that don't need an immense amount of natural resources, so I think it is overall a corruption problem.

You don't even need to study the production abilities, the crisis happened cause they were 5 billion euros minus in the budget for 25 years, I bet we could have easily prevented this without having to starve or something.

&gt;**Make sure you know how to correctly navigate roundabouts**.

Roundabouts are navigated differently in Spain than in most of the other countries I've driven in. Basically you need to remember three key points:

* **ANYONE** already on the roundabout has priority.
* **ANYONE** driving on the outermost lane of the roundabout has priority.
* No matter which of the exits you are going to take (even if you will be doing a 180º direction reversal), you must always use the outermost lane. This is especially important for exiting the roundabout: you **must** exit using the outermost lane. If you are forced to drive on the inner lanes, you must move to the outermost lane prior to taking the exit. If you cannot take the exit, make another turn. This is as stupid as it sounds, and most of the locals skip this rule... but you don't want to cut off anyone on the outermost lane, and it takes a little practice noticing what the intentions of the other drivers are -because too many of them don't know the correct use of turn indicators-.

The golden rule is: NEVER force someone driving with priority (be it because he's already in the roundabout or on an outer lane than yours) to either brake or avoid you because of your maneuvers.",0,1363313855,null,0,false,0,c8vvmxq,t3_1ab0t6,t1_c8vvmxq,t1_c8vq96z,null,1431589652,2,false,Madrid,t5_2si9y,2

I'm sick of this argument. The rulig party is building a dictatorship and anyone who raises their voice  against this is just gets the standard response: ""Ten years ago the MSZP has been doing something entirely different which I did not like."" What does it have to do with current events? As I recall the right wingers are usually bulshitting about ethics, eternal values, higher morals and such. Why do you not apply these to yourselves? Or ethics are only required from others, you can do anything?

On the other matter, how understandable this is. You have surely noticed, that MSZP has been devastated and does not show any signs of recovering. According to polls, as the supporters of Fidesz vaned, MSZP did not gain a single voter. Ferenc Gyurcsány's party has a lower support than the standard error of statistics, he could not benefit from the decline of Fidesz. So using this strategy they maneged to alienate anyone not already in the Fidesz sect. These voters did not leave because the smear campaign of the opposition, they simply got sick of the insane governing style and corruption flooding the country. The remaining supporters of Fidesz (Originally called the Alliance of Young Democrats = Fiatal Demokraták Szövetsége) are old-age pensioners and the far-right. This is a political suicide, as the former require constant pension increases which does not have any foundation, as the GDP is shrinking, increassing pensions are a constantly growing burden on the budget which will collapse very soon. At that exact moment of the first pension decrease, or a Forint collapse, the pensioners will leave Fidesz. Keeping their suppor requires an ever increasing funding, which the government tries to gather by bleeding the country dry. The result: The young are leaving the country, Matolcsy has announced that 5% of the population has immigrated to Europe, but the government has the votes of pensioners. Please explain to me how is it an understandable strategy to drive away young, skilled people from a country to keep the pensioners happy? This is simply ruining the country just to stay in power.  

The far-right  is an even trickier matter, they require the constant warfare, to vote for Fidesz. This whole ""freedom fight"" against the EU and IMF bullshit is for them. At the core it is a fight to be able to borrow money for double the interest offered by IMF and the right to forfeit a shitload of money given by the EU for free, all the while being branded as little better than North Korea by the whole civilised world, with weakening the Forint all the way.

There are some restaurants that serve calçots in Barcelona, but that's far from a calçotada experience. Going to BCN for a calçotada would be kind of like going to Atlanta for the seafood. A traditional calçotada will be open-air with the calçots cooked over dried grapevines from a nearby vineyard. You can get a pretty similar experience without all the smoke and cold at some restaurants, though. you'll need to head south a bit. Valls, in the province of Tarragona, is the epicenter of all things calçot-related. You don't have to go that far, but the closer you get the easier it is to find the real deal. 

Once you pass Sitges there are plenty of places to choose from, many of which specialize in calçots. I've been to a few places that only open on weekends during calçot season, seat maybe 500 people, with a huge row of sinks at the back of the dining room to wash off the your hands once you're finished. 

Can Lloses, in Sant Pere de Ribes, is good (if a little bit fancy), as is La Masia in Sitges. Further down, El Alamo near Reus in Alcover is awesome and grow their own on an attached farm.

I think the problem of the USA is, that it is a country of extremes, from death penalty (honestly, get rid of it; it's barbaric) to gay marriage (good guy USA); from 'Iran' to 'Sweden'. And it's far to large to compare it with a single European country. We should compare the USA with the EU or the entire European continent, and suddenly the USA doesn't look that 'bad' anymore compared with Europe.

Of course people have a tendency to only see the bad things, like death penalty, Guantanamo Bay, gun nuts, religious nuts, their war machinery or the Westboro Baptist Church. And they compare a 'continent' of 300 million people with 16 Million Dutch or 82 million Germans and point the finger at all the shortcomings of the USA - although we could learn a few things from the people on the other side of the big water.

Perhaps the solution is to allow people to chose what food they get from within balanced categories, so you can have a mixture of rice, pasta, bread, and potatoes; your choice of vegetables, and so on.

I do think it would be a good idea to reintroduce something like the wartime ""British Restaurants"", which provided at-cost cheap nutritious food (AIUI some countries in the East Bloc had similar arrangements during the communist era), since one of the commonly cited reasons for poor people eating bad food is lack of time to cook for themselves, especially when working long hours, having very long commutes, or working multiple part-time jobs.

I agree about free cooking courses - when I was at school cookery was a mandatory part of the curriculum for both boys and girls for the first two years of secondary school, and I think the concept is a good one (although the execution was pretty lousy at my schools).

[1] Essentially, there are two aspects. Firstly, that when a small burger meal costs the same as a capsicum/sweet pepper, if you've got very little money, it isn't a hard choice.

This man can clearly speak English, but if we're going to say in the spirit of valuing each others cultures and languages equally that all langauges are equal as official languages then we should follow through on that.",0,1363348023,null,0,false,0,c8w2cah,t3_1acdz2,t1_c8w2cah,t3_1acdz2,null,1431592826,69,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,69

You see, the small folk in here get punished by the fucktons even for a small mistake. Miss a payment here, forget a tax thingy there, accidentally your kid downloads one record illegally and you're fucked for years.

So of course when a minister fecks up, the people go bananas and are hell-bent for justice so that he politicians who manhandle the people once feel what it's like to be the ""victim"" of the system over a minor thing.

The cheapest door I've seen, ever, was a Finestra discount panel door made out of pressed cardboard or whatnot 49 euros in sale (if you know any cheaper ones gimme a hint, I actually need to replace one).

To get a carpenter with a door to fix it plus labour goes way, way beyond 100 euros. Everything in here costs a fuckload of valuable pieces of paper and metals.
