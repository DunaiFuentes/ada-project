true,Obraka,ASTR,Austrian in NL,"Austria has quite a funny drug law in regards of weed. The possession, dealing, growing of weed is forbidden, but that law only effects substances with a THC level higher than x% (0,0something). That makes seeds and even potent clones perfectly legal and you can buy both in the numerous growshops/smarshops in the cities, you are even allowed to grow it, but as soon as it starts to bloom you have to kill the plant. AFAIK they are mostly sold as ""air refreshener plants""

Every case of possession below 3grams THC (so about 30-50 grams) is instantly dropped by the court, but the local ""driving license"" authority is informed and will ask you to do a piss test 2-3 months after the incident (so enough for most people to get clean by then).

I don't know if there's a ""small possession"" limit for opiates or chemical drugs, I'm guessing so but no idea.

For alcohol, beer is cheap and produced local, wine as well, Schnaps too, of course. It's only expensive if you buy the imported stuff.

This means that the deficit is a concern right now, but this is what is SUPPOSED to happen. Lower the debt in the boom and deficit spend like mad in the bust, but now nobody trusts any deficit.

There was corruption, and it should be fixed. However, it is not the root cause of the problem. The current cause of the problem is that people are still required to pay their mortgages after the bank takes back a house in default.

If the problem is an overvalued real estate market, inflation is not going to help much with that as the real estate market prices just follow the inflation expectations; real estate is what is known as an ""inflation hedge"". High inflation works as a tax on people who have the majority of their savings in cash, i.e. poor people, and doesn't really do anything about markets where prices are negotiated, as opposed to fixed prices in a store.

It seems like a common theme to the troubles of Southern Europe (or at least in Spain from what I've read) is that a lot of money has been sunk into real estate and no money is coming out of that investment. And since the ones providing the loans depend on a return on this investment, no money is being lent out either. And because there is no money being lent out, businesses have trouble expanding and cannot open new job positions.

The first reason is why this story isn't very relevant, because having a lot of wind will inevitably lead to a large amount of export and import, because its intermittency leads to glut and famine.

Normal price tickets are valid for the whole day (obviously just for one direction and one travel).

If the train you are in is a direct train (which Hamburg -&gt; Frankfurt via Göttingen is i believe) you are not allowed to reboard another train once you boarded one train. On the other hand, if from Hamburg til Göttingen, no one stamps your ticket, feel free to jump off the train, spend two hours in Göttingen and reboard another train.

In general, I find it quite easy to ""cheat"" i.e. not let your ticket get stamped. Enter train, find seat, take of jacket, put out EVERYTHING you have in your bag (newspaper, food, drink, mp3-player, book, ...) and spread it out across the table in front of you. The next time a conductor comes to ask *Noch jemand zugestiegen?* just ignore him/her. With a little bit of luck/a crowded train you won't be noticed and can reimburse your non-stamped ticket at your destination train station. Costs 15€ *Bearbeitungsgebühr*.

Their playing career lasts until they are 35 if they are lucky, with many having fallen out of the top flight by then and earning much less (yeah, players like Giggs and co. are outliers).  There's a persistent risk during those years that they will be injured and have to leave the game altogether.  Once retired, a select few of them will go on to coaching and other related jobs like commentary, the rest having to either live off what they have made in their younger years or find something else to do (remember --- essentially no qualifications!).  Meanwhile, their clubs are raking in vast sums off their backs in revenue.

&gt; On 8 October 1991, ninety-three members of Bulgaria's National Assembly — virtually all of them affiliated with the former Communist Party — asked the constitutional court to declare the MRF unconstitutional citing article 11.4 of the constitution which explicitly bans political parties ""formed on ethnic, racial, and religious basis"".[3] On 21 April 1992, the court rejected the petition and affirmed the constitutionality of the MRF.[4]

&gt; Even though the MRF has been legally a part of Bulgarian political life since then, some Bulgarian ultra-nationalists, particularly the far-right National Union Attack, continue to assert that it is anti-constitutional because it consists mainly of ethnic Turks.

I am not a fan of DPS either, but you can't just go around banning parties because of their ethnic composition, especially since nowhere in [its charter](http://www.dps.bg/about/regulations.aspx) does DPS assert that it is an ethnic party.

Nein! Da kommt gleich Godwin im ersten Satz... Die Kritik an denen ist richtig und trifft auch zu. Was mich stört - oder sagen wir mal verwundert - sind die ganzen Forderungen am Rande. Verbotsdiskussionen, diese seltsame Posse um den Echo... 

Deutschland hat eine signifikante Menge von Leuten die nach rechtsaußen sehr offen sind (etwa 20% wenn ich mich erinnere, gibt es jedes Jahr eine Studie zu). 

Bei denen kassiert Frei.Wild eben ab. Das haben vorher die Böhsen Onkelz genauso getan. Die Frage die sich mir stellt ist wieso die Medien nicht mal den Fokus auf die Fans und die rechten Ressentiments in der Bevölkerung legen. So hat man das Gefühl, das Freiwild quasi aus dem nichts kommen, irgendwie böse sind und wenn man sie verbietet oder deren Konzerte verbietet alles wieder gut ist.

&gt; die medien sollten, meiner meinung nach, lieber ihre aufmerksamkeit auf die echten nazi lenken die prügeln und jugendzentren anzünden und nicht gegen die meinungsfreiheit ankämpfen die ihnen doch sonst so heilig ist

Naja der Vorwurf ist dass völkische und nationalistische Ideen durch die Band transportiert werden. Das ist auf jeden Fall so. Gibt ja auch noch andere solcher Bands z.B. Haudegen und so. Ist extrem beliebt bei Dorfnazis überall im Land. Vielleicht bringt diese Musik 13 jährige frustrierte Jungs dazu der örtlichen Kameradschaft näher zu kommen. 

Aber ich glaube nicht, dass die Musik die alleinige Ursache dafür ist. Sie ist eher ein Mittel um bestimmte Stimmungen und Gefühle zu wecken. Die Frage ist doch warum die Leute frustriert sind und sich in pathetischen Heimatliedern und Volksgebrabbel so wohl fühlen!? Das sind eben auch gesellschaftliche und ökonomische Gründe. Dieser Aspekt wird m.E. völlig ignoriert. Es ist eben einfacher eine Band oder ein Computerspiel zu skandalisieren als die gesellschaftlichen Ursachen versuchen zu erklären und zu ändern. 

Freiwild ist jedenfalls keinesfalls harmlos. Hör dir doch mal ein paar Kaiserjäger Songs im Netz an. Aus der Ecke kommen die. Die Frage ist nur, muss und kann man das als Gesellschaft tolerieren? Ich denke ja. Wenn sich jemand mehrfach distanziert dann kann man ihm nicht die Vergangenheit ewig vorwerfen. Auch wenn die Distanzierung unglaubwürdig ist. Darüber lässt sich trefflich streiten. Legt man das Maß, dass an Freiwild angelegt an andere Bands an ist es schon verwunderlich.

Hinzu kommt, dass wenn man sich Bushido und andere Gangster-Rapper Texte anhört auch antisemitische Textstellen zu finden sind und mindestens genauso viele moralische Probleme zu Tage treten. 

Und diese moralische Keule ist meiner Meinung nach eher kontraproduktiv. ",0,1364925434,null,0,1364925719,0,c972ubd,t3_1bibsn,t1_c972ubd,t1_c96y767,null,1431698050,3,false,de,t5_22i0,3

So according to your logic, not actively fighting the nazis automatically equals being a fullblown nazi? Ok.


&gt; even hundreds of thousands - of people carrying out the holocaust. They are nowhere near the same thing.

Except that at no point did ""hundreds of thousands"" carry out the crimes of the Shoah.  
It was, at best, a handful of people who really pulled the strings, and another group of poor saps weren't heroic enough to refuse orders. Because guess what else a dictatorship usually brings? Death penalty for otherwise arguably trvial things, such as *refusal of orders*. Further, keep in mind that your average joe Reichsarmee soldier was very unlikely to be a patriotic nazi, considering that half of them were forcefully drafted into the army.

Look, let's make one thing perfectly clear here. I would *never* defend nazis. That I simply don't. But I ***REFUSE*** to demonize people based on their nationality, simply because a bunch of dickheads decided to go full apeshit 70 years ago. My family suffered long enough under the rule of the Nazis, and I will not become a monster like them.

If you wish to demonize everyone around you, and even try to justify pointless murder, it's your problem. But don't expect any respect from anyone for that.

That doesn't make it infallible or moral though, since not everyone within the process has an equal amount of power, and not everyone has benevolent or neutral intentions.

&gt;The market is a balance that has emerged based on individuals making free choices on how to spend their own money. This seems to me like the fairest and most democratic way to determine the value of something.

'The free market will fix it', right? That's not how it works in real life, unless you replace people with robots.

&gt;According to you, on the other hand, the better way is to override that collective determination of value and instead arbitrarily decide how much footballers ""deserve"", based on a subjective, unquantifiable sense of fairness.

This is the issue right here. The money wasn't in the UK, Laiki wasn't operating as a bank in UK, it was operating from Cyprus and had just offices in London.

EDIT: The danger is here is that Laiki estate will sue UK or Cypriot states into court of allowing some depositors to transfer their monies away, thus putting creditors in unequal position, and try to get either UK or Cyprus to compensate them the amount of money that would have been taken away from the depositors if they had stayed in Laiki.

The Turkish authorities should leave Northern Cyprus, pay damages to Greek Cypriots still alive who lost property and/or family during the invasion, and there should be a population transfer : all the mainland Turkish families who were brought to Cyprus to colonize it should be expelled from Cyprus (though this may shock some of you, this kind of population exchange has already been done between Greece and Turkey, and of course with other ethnicites like Germans after WW2, Israeli colonists leaving Gaza etc..). Ethnic Turkish Cypriots who were on the island before Turkish invasion should be allowed to stay.

Kosovo, although rather recently populated by migrant Muslim Albanians (Kosovo used to be majority Serb a century or two ago) can reasonably claim independence, but the majority Serb Northern part should be given back to Serbia, and there should be a population exchange of Serbs and Albanians from the ethnic enclaves in Kosovo and Serbia.

Now, I admit that's my opinion as a non-Cypriot/Turk/Albanian/Serb... Just my fantasies as to how I'd redraw Europe if I were Emperor of the world :p

I don't consider South Caucasus to be in Europe. To me the South-East border of Europe is the tip (middle) of the Caucasus mountainrange. These countries are south of it, hence not in Europe.

No, not actively opposing them doesn't make them a ""fullblown nazi"", but it does mean that they can wash their hands after (and you can wash their hands for them) and pretend like Hitler didn't have huge amounts of support. In this situation not opposing is the same as consent.

* In the 90s large housing corporations were privatised, turning social housing into a for-profit business. The end result is that if you want to have some tiny, noisy, 1930s appartment in a shitty neighbourhood in Amsterdam you need to wait around 10 years before it's your turn. You get to pay 500-650 euros for it too.

* In the 2000s builing offices became popular due to all kinds of subsidies. Currently 14% of offices stands unused, and now demolishing them gets you subsidies. No joke.

* The current Lib-Lab government slashed spending and instituted cuts, while slashing taxes for corporations and keeping the insane 'mortage interest deductability' intact (initially). Of course people started saving more, more cuts are hanging over our head like the Sword of Damocles.

In this situation not opposing is the same as consent.

You're aware of the hyperinflation that caused Hitler to rise, and pretty much turned 80% of the German population completely poor, are you? To put it in other words, you could either

+ Try to fight nazis, i.e., people with rifles, with your bare hands (I'll just assume that you're able to imagine how a rifle-to-fists fight would normally end), or
+ Try to feed your family by working 3-4 shitty jobs (and I don't mean walmart-shitty, I mean coalmining-shitty) a day for a pay that makes slavery look like vacation

&gt;I'm suggesting the average German was not as innocent as you make them out to be.

You're disregarding *any* other factor that might have made it either very difficult to resist, or, most likely, completely impossible to resist. Which, either way, *does* mean that you at least generalize pretty damn hard.

&gt;but to suggest a handful of people were pulling the strings (which they were) and the rest were completely devoid of responsibility I find insulting.

Did I suggest anything like that? There's a difference between ""not denying orders because it would basically mean a bullet to the head"" and ""being innocent"".

&gt; they appealed to the prejudices ingrained in German (and European) culture

No, they looked for someone to blame for the shitty economy after WW1. They scapegoated jews. At that time, not a single country in the western world was exactly a nice place for jews. And because of the whole jesus-thing, the plan seemed solid to most people. What you keep forget to mention is, however, that most people were entirely unaware that the nazis didn't just ""move jews away"", but actually murdered them. Oh, but surely you're going to tell me that it was the responsibility of every German citizen at the time to be able to know that anyway, right? I can totally see how you're not demonizing.

Es geht nicht um Einkommen, es geht um Vermögen wie bspw das Ingenieurs-Ehepaar, was sich über Jahrzente und mit guten Investitionen, harter Arbeit und langen Nächten in eine gute Position gebracht hat oder die Unternehmerfamilie die über Generationen ein Privatvermögen aufgebaut hat.

Die Linke arbeitet ausschliesslich für Sozialhilfeempfänger und im Namen ""sozialer Gerechtigkeit"". Die Definition von sozialer Gerechtigkeit bei der Linken sieht ungefähr so aus: Alle die mehr haben als andere, sollten es denen geben die weniger haben, bis die die ursprünglich mehr hatten sich auch nichtsmehr leisten können.

Das ganze wirst du nicht in den Wahlprogrammen finden, da die Linke genauso korrupt und verlogen auf Stimmenfang geht, wie der Rest. Der einzige Unterschied ist, dass wenn genug Leute auf die Linke reinfallen die gesamte deutsche Wirtschaft den Bach runter geht.

Zum Edit 1:

Willst du uns eigentlich verarschen? Unter Merkel ist (ohne ihr Verschulden) eine massive Ausnahmesituation aufgetreten von der du vielleicht schonmal gehört hast: Die globale Finanzkrise 2007. Und weisst du, was die mit dem Geld gemacht haben? Jobs gerettet. Das weltweit einzigartige Verhalten der deutschen Regierung in Zeiten der Krise ist dafür verantwortlich, dass es Deutschland heute so gut geht wie es auch nur irgend möglich ist. Unter der Kritik ökonomisch Ungebildeter stampfte die Regierung innerhalb weniger Wochen ein Bollwerk gegen den massiven Verlust von Arbeitsplätzen und den Ruin vieler mittelständischer Unternehmen in der Form einer Änderung des Gesetzes zur Kurzarbeit aus dem Boden. Ich war nie ein Fan der Schwarzen und Gelben aber die Art wie sie die Finanzkrise gemeistert haben ist ein Beispiel dafür, dass die auch noch einen Plan haben, wenn die Finanz- und Güterwirtschaft weltweit massive Verluste hinnehmen muss.

Und [hier](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/thumb/9/96/Staatsschuldenquote_in_DE.pdf/page1-800px-Staatsschuldenquote_in_DE.pdf.jpg) kannst du dann mal sehen wie die Schuldenentwicklung tatsächlich aussieht. Der massive Anstieg lag nicht nur an Neuschulden sondern vor allem auch am Einbrauch des BIP durch die in Zeiten der Krise stark abgefallene Nachfrage.


Ich fasse es nicht, dass du tatsächlich die Eier hast die Finanzkompetenz jener in Frage zu stellen, die in großem Maße dafür verantwortlich sind, dass unser größtes Problem dieser Tage der Fakt ist dass wir dem Griechen usw Geld leihen anstatt wie viele Griechen hungrig ins Bett zu gehen und auf die Gutmütigkeit einer anderen Nation zu hoffen.

E il problema non e' stato che 'il capitale e' fuggito'; ma che ci siamo indebitati fino alla morte, abboffandoci di credito a basso interesse (grazie all'affidabilita' della Germania) e, invece di investirlo (come hanno fatto Germania e Scandinavia) ce lo siamo magnato.  Questo piano piano e' stato compreso dai mercati che ora si rifiutano di prestarci altri soldi a basso interesse, perche' riconoscono in noi un investimento a rischio molto piu' alto dell'equivalente tedesco. Proprio questo e' spread.

&gt;Certificati verdi: un valore intorno ai 155 euro/kWh

perché come al solito c'è da sparare bestemmie in ogni luogo ed in ogni lago, a causa di numerose pecche dell'articolo.

1- Il titolo. Non crolla il costo dell'energia prodotta dall'eolico, ma crolla la sua incentivazione. La cosa veramente da stronzi però è che l'incentivazione non viene fatta come col fotovoltaico di casa Cupiello (ovvero gira e rigira, lo stato mette a disposizione dei danari per far rientrare prima il tuo investimento e renderlo competitivo), ma avviene tramite l'emissione dei Certificati Verdi, che sono dei titoli che si possono negoziare.

Mi spiego nella maniera più veloce che mi viene in mente: se Gino produce 1 MWh di energia ""pulita"", guadagna 1 certificato. Pino produce 10 MWh con del carbone marcio (pierogiuseppe.jpg) e per legge DEVE fare in modo che di quei 10 MWh, uno sia pulito. Quindi siccome non vuole scazzarsi a costruire un impianto da hippie maledetto, PAGA Gino per COMPRARSI il suo MW pulito e poter continuare a pompare energia infernale nella rete, rispettando le regole.

Così Pino è contento perché vende quello che produce, e Gino è contento perché incassa SIA dalla vendita dell'energia, CHE dalla negoziazione dei certificati verdi. Lo stato in tutto questo non mette un eypos.

2- 
&gt;per vent'anni riceverà una tariffa per ogni MWh prodotto dal suo impianto 

NOT: sono 15, e solo per gli impianti entrati in funzione DOPO il 31/12/2007. Per gli altri sono 8.

3-
&gt;il prezzo del MWh è quello più elevato fra tutti gli impianti elettrici necessari a soddisfare la domanda a una data ora.

NOT: [il sistema del prezzo marginale: tale meccanismo remunera i produttori pagando a tutti il prezzo di equilibrio tra domanda e offerta, che è pari al prezzo dell’offerta più costosa TRA QUELLE ACCETTATE per soddisfare la domanda.](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borsa_elettrica)

Inizio intervento sulla borsa dell'energia

--------------------------------
Mi spiego meglio, ma ho bisogno di una [figura](http://www.agienergia.it/documenti/immagini/Figura%2046.bmp).

In borsa vanno chi produce energia e chi la compra.

E PER CIASCUNA ORA i produttori sanno cosa possono produrre ed a quale prezzo. In genere c'è una sola regola: vende chi propone la tariffa oraria più bassa. Se hai la centrale più bella del mondo, ma il tuo MWh vale uno strafottio, rimani spento, stronzo. 

Si parte con un produttore che dice  ""Io sono disposto a produrre -diamo numeri a caso- 10 MWh al prezzo di 5 €/MWh"". Ovviamente quelli che non sono incentivati non riescono ad avere un profitto con questa tariffa, quindi non rilanciano manco per il cazzo con una tariffa inferiore, lasciando vendere chi, come i cogenerativi (ma anche tutti gli impianti fotovoltaici, eolici, inferiori ai 10 MW, ed altri microbi inutili), essendo incentivati in qualche modo, possono permettersi prezzi più bassi.

Così parte una gara all'ultimo sangue tra poveracci, che ribassano il prezzo fino a che uno non la spunta e si aggiudica questi merda di 10 MWh.

Si va avanti così finché i pesci piccoli non finiscono e tutti producono al 100% della potenza della centrale. Parliamo comunque di quantità di energia MOLTO BASSE (in Italia, dove non è presente il nuculare). Nessuno rimane spento o deve produrre di meno, perché per coprire tutta la domanda nazionale c'è da correre ancora di brutto.

Per i grossi produttori la storia è praticamente la stessa, ma si trattano prezzi più alti per quantità di energie più alte. Non tutti potranno spuntare il miglior prezzo per il proprio impianto e magari qualcuno preferirà ridurre la potenza della propria centrale per non doversi svenare, rimettendoci un sacco di soldi (perché produrre molto può risultare in una perdita di danari è chiarita successivamente).

Comunque, gli sgozzamenti procedono, fino a quando non sono stati coperti OGNI SINGOLO Watt-ora di potenza per la determinata ora del tale giorno.

Passiamo al lato della domanda.

Arrivano i primissimi a chiedere due spiccioli di energia, e dicono ""Noi siamo una piccola acciaieria e facciamo suole in acciaio. Ci servono 2 schifosi MWh. Possiamo pagarli 10 €/MWh senza fattura"". Questi possono permettersi di offrire così tanto perché per una fornitura tanto piccola non fanno tanto gli schizzinosi, e sono disposti a pagare qualcosina in più.

Se non c'è nessuno che offre di più, il tizio si è aggiudicato la fornitura.

E così via finché non finiscono gli sfigati.

Arriva Johnny Cartieradimmerda e dice ""A me servono 12 Gigastiglioni di Watt-ora. Però dovete farmi lo sconto. Pago al massimo 3 €/MWh"". È logico che più la fornitura necessaria aumenta, più uno cerca di tirare sul prezzo. Come quando dal fruttivendolo cerchi di farti dare la mela gratis se compri 2 kg di pomodori, ma non quando sei lì per acquistare una carota.

Ovviamente se qualcuno offre di più, Johnny rimane a bocca asciutta e scoperto per quell'ora, quindi dovrà darsi da fare o l'azienda fa pausa pranzo alle 10.

Così continua la saga della domanda, fino a quando non sono stati coperti OGNI SINGOLO Watt-ora di potenza per la determinata ora del tale giorno.

Parentesi riguardo chi compra l'energia di casa nostra:

Io, a quanto pare, non consumo tanto quanto uno zuccherificio. Quindi mi romperebbe le palle dover andare sul sito di Terna tutti i giorni e comprare per ogni ora la mia misera energia. Per me ci pensa l' Acquirente Unico, che gestisce le forniture di tutti noi comuni mortali.

Siamo alla fine delle trattazioni e, mettendo tutte le domande ed offerte nel grafico della figura, otteniamo due curve che si intersecano in un punto. Per avere una visione più chiara, [questa](http://qualenergia.it/sites/default/files/articolo-doc/figura1_zorzoli.JPG) è una seconda immagine.

A quel punto corrisponde una ordinata, che definisce il PREZZO che TUTTI gli acquirenti pagano per la loro fornitura, e TUTTI i produttori percepiscono per la loro produzione.

Così i tizi che erano disposti a produrre 10 MWh per 5 €/MWh NON prendono quella tariffa, ma prendono IL PREZZO MARGINALE (che è sempre di più... mettiamo quei 70 €/MWh dell'articolo, e tutti sono felici). Mentre i tizi che erano disposti a produrre 100 MWh per 150 €/MWh se la prendono nel sedere, e percepiranno sempre e solo quei 70 del prezzo marginale. Per questo è possibile perdere un sacco di soldi quando uno mette sul mercato un sacco di MWh al limite delle proprie possibilità economiche.

La cosa si equilibra da sola sotto due aspetti: quello economico, perché il guadagno che hanno primi provengono proprio dalle perdite dei secondi, quindi nessun introito si crea o si distrugge dal nulla.

Inoltre, il prezzo è sempre influenzato al 90% dai grossi produttori, perché producendo più energia riescono a spostare quel punto di intersezione parecchio vicino ai loro tariffari. Quindi è raro che ci siano grossi lacrimoni, a fine giornata.

-------------------------------
Fine intervento sulla borsa dell'energia

Quindi è vero che produrre con un combinato costa di più, ma non è esattamente vero che

&gt; In genere, l’offerta più alta è rappresentata dalle centrali a gas a ciclo combinato.

Perché queste spesso (quando accoppiate con una utenza termica, quindi in cogenerazione) godono di incentivazioni sia in termini di certificati verdi (sono esentati dal loro acquisto), che in termini di priorità di dispacciamento (in sostanza un impianto cogenerativo che offre una quota di energia ad un prezzo uguale ad una altra centrale fossile ha la precedenza, e ruba il posto alla fonte fossile). Quindi possono permettersi di proporre un prezzo più basso di altri.

4- Questa mossa è stata giusta in quanto il mercato dell'eolico era da troppo tempo una isola beata per la speculazione (come le tariffe del fotovoltaico di qualche anno fa). Ma dire che ciò si traduce in un abbattimento del costo dell'eolico è da stronzi.

Perché è come dire che togliere l'IMU e portare l'IVA al 5% domattina si tradurrebbe direttamente in un guadagno per le famiglie.

Anzi, non escludo (ma è una possibilità lontana) che questa mossa possa agevolare di non poco chi deve COMPRARE questi titoli. Gente che continuerà la propria produzione ""sporca"", con un -30% di costi in Certificati Verdi dall'oggi al domani.

A meno che la plusvalenza del titolo non venga gestita dal GSE, usandola per i soliti scopi (in genere segretarie con le poppe più grosse... o magari per coprire parte delle incentivazioni sul fotovoltaico).

**tl;dr: il costo dell'eolico è sceso per i cazzi suoi. Per questo, al fine di evitare speculazioni ancor più massicce, sono stati ritoccati i meccanismi dietro i prezzi dei certificati verdi. Forse (ma poco probabilmente) facendo anche un grosso favore ai produttori da fonte fossile.**

Well yes, why significant numbers of people supported them does not eliminate the fact that significant numbers of people supported them.

&gt;Try to fight nazis, i.e., people with rifles, with your bare hands (I'll just assume that you're able to imagine how a rifle-to-fists fight would normally end),

Firstly they didn't start out with rifles, they started out with populist rhetoric and then brung the rifles out. Secondly, you do know that the allies would jump at the chance to arm a resistance movement don't you?

&gt;You're disregarding any other factor that might have made it either very difficult to resist, or, most likely, completely impossible to resist.

I may be, and for that I apologize. What I'm saying is regardless of their motives - whether fear, cowardice, or lack of means - the people gave the nazi party a lot of support, which leads me to assume a lot of people agreed with them.

&gt;Did I suggest anything like that?

I thought you did:

&gt;a **bunch** of dickheads decided to go full apeshit 70 years ago.

That, to me, implies that it was a small number of people, not a significant portion of the population.

&gt;There's a difference between ""not denying orders because it would basically mean a bullet to the head"" and ""being innocent"".

I agree, they weren't innocent.

&gt;No, they looked for someone to blame for the shitty economy after WW1. They scapegoated jews. At that time, not a single country in the western world was exactly a nice place for jews. And because of the whole jesus-thing, the plan seemed solid to most people.

You're basically rephrasing what I said and managing to disagree with me at the same time. Yes, they scapegoated the jews, that's what I meant by ""prejudices ingrained in German (and European) culture"" (as well as I giant dose of militarism and imperialism) and populism.

&gt;What you keep forget to mention is, however, that most people were entirely unaware that the nazis didn't just ""move jews away"", but actually murdered them.

There's a lot of debate about how much people knew about the death camps (pretty much everyone knew about concentration camps) but lets assume you're correct (which, imo, is very likely). I recognize that everyone knew about the jews fleeing Germany after a very public and very widespread hate campaign, which large sections of the population supported, and that is enough to condemn them regardless of them having knowledge of the death camps. 

I would still like to know how I'm ""justify pointless murder.""

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Firstly they didn't start out with rifles, they started out with populist rhetoric and then brung the rifles out. Secondly, you do know that the allies would jump at the chance to arm a resistance movement don't you?

You mean, just like when the White Rose and Edelweiss pirates tried sending leaflets to the UK, and begging for their help, which the UK ignored until it was too late? Yeah, the allies sure were generous with their help. 

&gt;I may be, and for that I apologize. What I'm saying is regardless of their motives - whether fear, cowardice, or lack of means - the people gave the nazi party a lot of support, which leads me to assume a lot of people agreed with them.

I would love to accept your apology, but, no offense, I don't see you bettering in your arguments in any way. The truth is, the nazis abused the economic outhouse that Germany was at the time for their own nefarious purposes. Claiming that ""everyone basically helped them"", THAT my friend, that's the real insult here.

&gt;Well yes, why significant numbers of people supported them does not eliminate the fact that significant numbers of people supported them.

In case this part wasn't clear yet, let me write it down for you:

    Being a member of the nazi party =/= being a murderer

Being a member of the nazi party had devolved into pretty much the only way to keep your own company alive (if you were lucky enough to still own yours), *OR* allow you to create your own company. It also included a range of lots of other things, such as healthcare, not just for you, but also for your family. So, by the time the nazis overthrew the legitimate, democratic Government of the German Republic as declared by Philipp Scheidemann (may he rest in peace), the nazi party pretty much defined the everyday economic AND social life in the so-called ""reich"" of the nazi criminals.

But I'll await your argument, how that somehow doesn't change anything at all, with glee and anticipation.

&gt;I thought you did:

You thought wrong. The 'bunch' part was part of the general insult towards the Nazis. Don't tell me I have to explain to you how insults work.

&gt;I agree, they weren't innocent.

The ones who murdered certainly weren't, and I didn't say anything like that. But you phrased it as if you were to say that any German soldier who was unfortunate enough to find himself in a Wehrmacht Uniform was a nazi. And that would simply be a lie.

&gt;There's a lot of debate about how much people knew about the death camps (pretty much everyone knew about concentration camps) but lets assume you're correct (which, imo, is very likely). 


I don't doubt that at least a decent amount of people knew about the concentration camps -- but the thing is, a concentration camp doesn't exactly imply murder. I know what you think, but it is the way it is. People assumed that the victims were merely incarcerated, to be used for forced labour, or to be moved to other places. It's still very much ugly, but it's not the same as murder. The whole idea of ethnic cleansing was almost entirely unknown to the bigger chunk of the population.


&gt; I recognize that everyone knew about the jews fleeing Germany after a very public and very widespread hate campaign, which large sections of the population supported, and that is enough to condemn them regardless of them having knowledge of the death camps.


One might claim that this hate campaign was predictable, considering how much the nazis were hitting the drums, but the hate campaign didn't say *anything* about actually rounding up all jews and shooting them. You're comparing apples to pears here, and it's a very thin line you're walking on.

&gt;I would still like to know how I'm ""justify pointless murder.""

To me, you sound like someone who would consider an act that happened long before the lifetime of some people as a legitimate enough reason to... ""round them up for their own protection"". Feel free to correct me, if I'm wrong.

No, non c'entra nulla il comprare.. capisco che tu sia confuso, perche' il tipo del video continuava a dire che 'la gente compra i bund tedeschi invece di quelli italiani'.. che e' una cavolata!!

Lo spread ha a che fare coi tassi di interesse del denaro in prestito; se io sono diligente, affidabile, con un buon lavoro e un'ottima reputazione, posso ottenere un mutuo in banca a buone condizioni; questo perche' la banca sa che il rischio che io scappi alle Maldive con la ganza e' basso.
Se sei un disgraziato inaffidabile e senza lavoro fisso con la reputazione del cazzoniere, e' dura che la banca ti faccia un mutuo.. ma se te lo fa, te lo fa a un interesse altissimo perche' deve compensare per il rischio che tu non possa ripagarla.  

Questo e' quello che sta succedendo; non sono gli italiani 'comprano i bond tedeschi', anche perche' i Bond tedeschi hanno un rendimento bassissimo; sono i mercati che non vogliono piu' finanziarci senza avere ampia contropartita per i rischi. In breve, non c'e' nessuna fuga di capitali!!

&gt; Per la seconda obiezione:per fare un bonifico...devi avere un conto dove fai il bonifico.

E secondo te quanto ci si mette a aprire un conto a Barclays, o a ING, e a trasferire tutto? Appena vien fuori che c'e' anche l'ombra di una possibilita', vedi quanto ci mettono le banche estere a saltare sull'opportunita' di svuotare le casse delle banche italiane!

&gt; quanto ottenere un effetto benefico da una valuta parallela.

Questo vorrebbe dire due valute, cambio 'ufficiale' e cambio 'mercato nero' (un po' come succede ora in Venezuela)..
Come ti fai pagare, in valuta 'reale' (Euro) o valuta 'parallela' che puo' essere svalutata in qualunque momento? E i mutui, poi, li fai in Euro o nella valuta parallela? 

.. se ti interessano queste cose io ti consiglierei di seguire qualche corso di economia, possibilmente da qualche fonte accreditata, non da qualche tipetto col canale youtube.. Puoi iniziare con un po' di microeconomia,  secondo me ti chiarisci le idee..

By the way, ""engineer"" is a five/six years (graduate) degree in France, so many internship offers for ""engineering students"" will be for their 6-months last semester internship in year 5.

Big companies which might hire engineer : SNCF, Airbus, EADS, Schneider Electric, EDF, Alstom, Saint-Gobain, to name a few.

You may want to look at campusfrance, the American Embassy in Paris and the French Foreign Minister websites which may give you info.

They pushed for a study into where the EU helps or hinders its member states, they sent top flight representatives to invite EU countries to contribute, to answer questions to present a balanced appraisal and way forward.  Some countries responded.  A handful.  The French and German governments collaborated in their refusal to even address the issue, effectively boycotting it.

When they say the UK should help more in European goals they mean the UK should get in line with their goals for Europe, not the UK's, as they see them.  It's not as if it's a new attitude by the UK, they were warning about the direction of Europe since the early 90s - why else have they retained so many opt outs and vetoes?  Same goes for Sweden in refusing to join the Euro.

When countries of mention outside the economic bed of disaster which is the EZ try to influence the tiller of the ship, they're told that they need to follow someone else's goals and course settings on Europe.  It's time overdue that those countries that have been proven right in their forewarnings are listened to.

But I suppose the best you can do (in proud German fashion) is to be pragmatic about it. What the greeks, cypriots, Spaniards are doing is human nature because humans simply refuse to admit guilt on this level. 

I do honestly think Merkel has been doing well although maybe more of an effort could be made to communicate that austerity is for everyone's benefit. The ""7 percent of the world’s population,  25 percent of global GDP and 50 per cent of global social spending"" point she made should be brought up more often - it really highlights the absurdity of the situation. 

But what would really help is more support from the EU though.. the fact that its been lacking maybe indicates that the EU as an organization is premature. Maybe Europe just isnt ready for it yet? It certainly seems (retrospectively) that some states got membership before they were ready. But maybe the EU can emerge from this even better? 

Anyway, in my worthless opinion, I think most Americans are fiscally conservative/ socially liberal  &amp; generally appreciate/support Germany's difficult position here.

Usually when you break it open with the knife you remove several large chunks of fat off the leg, those are preserved to use as a makeshift lid, so when you´re done cutting you use those chunks to cover the exposed flesh, 

But that's only the first layer of protection, you also cover the piece with a cheese cloth or lint cloth soaked in olive oil or rendered lard so there's always a layer of fat protecting the exposed flesh, but remember these are stop gap measures and a opened piece will last a maximum of a few weeks, depending on the conditions it will either rot, or dry out depending on your storage place (cool, dry and away from direct sunlight)

The knife is basically a 10-12"" straight edge boning knife, you work from the top down always cutting downwards, the idea is that you nick the meat at an  downwards angle and grab the top of the slice as you work downwards aiming for inch long pieces as thin as you can go while being reasonable, paper thin doesn´t taste like anything, you tug slightly on the slice as you´re cutting it off the ham,

The thickness and quality of the slices will depend on the sharpness and flexibility of the knife, Arcos is a OK Spanish knife brand, i own a Arcos Santoku knife i have my guests use so they dont touch my henkles, its ok...

I could be underhanded and point out that an e.g. Manchester United player provides unmitigated joy for a good fraction of their 659 million fans every year when they watch them play, likely far more joy in aggregate than a nurse can ever hope to supply over a career, and in a roundabout way serves a social function (""bread and circuses"", remember?) but that would neither be here nor there.

And he will still provide just as much joy at 10% of the price.

&gt;No, they ""should"" earn that much because that's what the market has settled on for their remuneration, and any attempt to change this through legislation is likely to have uninteneded consequences and screams of government getting itself involved in places that it has no rights to be involved.

You can tell that the two are very separate ideas by the fact that if you introduced an earnings cap on footballers the wages of nurses would not budge one iota.

you are looking for a cheap way to travel, right? 

https://www.couchsurfing.org/

Believe me, it is a great way to travel. Don't do it all the time, but from time to time. If you come to a new city and you only know about it from lonely planet or the internet, go couchsurfing. The hosts are locals and normally very friendly people that like to meet new people. They will show you around, show you things away from touristic places. Cool bars, nice restaurants, etc. Moreover you get a glimpse on how life of the local people is, how their culture and mentality is. It is really a good thing.

If you are not sure about the hosts, just check their profile. It works like ebay. The more positive comments they have, the better staying at their place will be. 

I am not saying, do this all the time, but at least try it!

true,TubePanic,europe,,"Quando uno stato emette buoni del tesoro, prende di fatto soldi in prestito - esattamente come puo' fare un privato quando va in banca.

Il problema e' cosa fai poi con questi soldi; per esempio, puoi investirli per migliorare le infrastrutture (produzione di energia elettrica, trattamento rifiuti, autostrade, scuola e sanita', tribunali e giustizia). Se fai questo, a fronte dei costi iniziali (il tuo investimento) avrai poi un ritorno di valore, in termini di minori spese e miglior produttivita' ed efficienza della tua forza lavoro. Questo di consentira' di essere piu' competitivo,  abbassare la disoccupazione, ridurre le tasse, migliorare la bilancia dei pagamenti ecc... in pratica, tutto questo poi si traduce in un saldo positivo al netto degli interessi che devi pagare a chi ha comprato i tuoi BOT. [per favore economisti di Reddit non mi sparate - lo so che sto semplificando]

Se invece prendi i soldi in prestito e li usi per pagare - che so - una burocrazia enorme, inefficiente e improduttiva, lavori pubblici e cantieri che non finiscono mai perche' sono stati aggiudicati a suon di tangenti, una scuola e una universita' che lasciamo perdere.. alla fine i soldi che hai speso non ti daranno alcun ritorno - e a quel punto, come fai a pagare gli interessi? Con altro debito?

Direi che ci siamo comportati come il tipo che, andato in banca a chiedere un prestito, invece di investirlo se ne e' andato al ristorante.. e se l'e' magnato in tartufi e champagne..   

E ora stiamo a piatire contro la Merkel e l'europa germanocentrica.. chi e' causa del suo mal, pianga se' stesso!!

Spero che la spiegazione abbia senso..

Oltre a questo, abbiamo fatto promesse come per esempio con le pensioni, che non potevamo mantenere, anche perche' non siamo stati in grado di gestire i loro contributi.

Competition is no longer what it used to. The market tendency has been to concentrate. Look at the media example. 30 years ago things were more spread apart and competing. Same goes for Cell and data communication (ISP). Car industry, food industry, big pharma, even audit and investment companies. They all concentrate.

You see, bigger companies, like banks, to which they are tied, need to grow and the only space left is their competition. Remember banks were in lack of people borrowing and opened up the subprime loans. Same goes for large companies. To them this is the logical next step but it's going to end badly for us.

I [BOT](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buono_Ordinario_del_Tesoro) e i [BTP](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btp_Italia) sono i modi in cui lo stato riceve finanziamenti dai privati o da enti. Funzionano entrambi in questo modo: tu compri una cedola da 1000€ pagando un prezzo inferiore al valore nominale (per esempio 950€) e lo stato 

  * Ti ritorna 1000€ alla scadenza del BOT (max 12 mesi)
  * Ti ripaga gradualmente la differenza ogni 6 mesi e la somma pagata alla scadenza del BTP (3,5,10,15 o 30 anni)

In ogni caso, non è possibile avere rimborsata la cedola prima della scadenza naturale. Una possibilità è vendere a un'altro investitore la cedola a un prezzo concordato. Nota che in questo caso non avviene nessun trasferimento di capitali per lo stato.

I titoli vengono venduti in aste competitive in cui normalmente il numero di compratori eccede il numero di titoli disponibili. Per fare un esempio: immagina che l'italia ha bisogno di 2mld€ ogni 6 mesi per ripagare i BOT in scadenza e gli interessi. Il ministero del tesoro indice un [asta](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asta_competitiva) per vendere questi 2mln di titoli da 1000€, e si presentano investitori per 3mln di titoli, che fanno le loro offerte per il prezzo di acquisto dei titoli. Lo stato chiaramente sceglie di accettare le offerte più convenienti e scarta quelle in eccesso, pagando il prezzo più alto accettato (asta marginale). 

Quello che sta succedendo in questi anni è che alle aste tedesche ci sono molti più investitori rispetto alle aste italiane e questi ultimi richiedono un guadagno più consistente a fronte di un rischio percepito maggiore. Quindi lo stato italiano paga un tasso di interesse maggiore sui suoi titoli, ma questo non vuol dire che vi è un flusso di capitali! Lo stato tedesco e lo stato italiano in media vendono sempre tutti i titoli offerti^1, quindi la quantità di denaro disponibile rimane sempre la stessa.

Spero di aver chiarito la questione. Nota: quella di sopra è una semplificazione, spero di non aver offeso nessun economista :)

Approximately one year ago, Free came up with a new phone plan which was 20€/month, illimited texting (sms and mms), illimited calling (with many others countries available either on landlines or mobile lines) and internet (3Go on ""fair use"", which means you can go beyond 3Go but your date speed will be slower). Following that, many other phone providers came up with similar plans. The more populars are b&amp;you, sosh and free mobile, which are similar : you have to buy them on the internet, you have more or less the same advantages (countries may differt, date on internet may vary from 1Go to 3Go). Free mobile used to be not very reliable and calling would not work on high traffic hours, but everything is back to normal now. 
If you don't need as much calling time, there are actually cheaper ones. You'll find this website useful, I think : http://www.choisirsonforfait.com/
But really, there are not many differences between the different brands (everybody has had a particular bad experience with one or the other mobile provider, but it's usually more about personal tastes and good / bad luck than the actual quality of the provider). 

As for the other questions : those plans are cheaper because you only interact with internet websites. You can't purchase them at the store and if you need help, you have to use their forums which relie mainly on the community of other users). The SIM card will be sent to your house, usually quite quickly (in 2-4 days you could start using the mobile plan). 
About buying it from the US, I think you'll need a French address and a French credit card, but as I was saying, you should get the SIM card quite quickly once you buy it on the website. The monthly fee will be automatically taken from your bank account, so you won't have to worry about that.

Finally, beware that stopping the contract is not as easy as signing up for it : you'll need to send a written letter with ""accusé de reception"" (registered mail ?), so think enough ahead before you leave the country !

J'arrive à imaginer des métriques à peu près objectives pour le coté social (ratio entre les revenus moyens ou ceux du premier décile par exemple) mais j'en vois peu du coté écologique.

* Comment évalue-t-on la ""valeur d'usage"" ? La valeur marchande s'en veut une approximation, souvent assez fausse, mais qui a l'avantage d'être très facile à mesurer.


Je vois une autre approximation qui pourrait marcher (mais qui comporte également un peu d'erreur) : la valeur d'usage serait le pourcentage de son revenu qu'une personne est prête à consacrer à une denrée.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;You mean, just like when the White Rose and Edelweiss pirates tried sending leaflets to the UK, and begging for their help, which the UK ignored until it was too late? Yeah, the allies sure were generous with their help.

I've never heard of them sending leaflets to the UK, and ""begging for their help"". Do you have any more information about this? What 'help' did they ask for that the UK could have provided?

&gt; Claiming that ""everyone basically helped them"", THAT my friend, that's the real insult here.

I didn't claim that. I claimed that the resistance movement was very small and ineffective and a significant portion of the population likely agreed with the nazis. While the rest just went along with it, which while it is not ""helping"" them is not really opposing them either.

&gt;In case this part wasn't clear yet, let me write it down for you:
Being a member of the nazi party =/= being a murderer

I know. When I said ""support"" I didn't mean they were pulling the trigger - I meant they agreed with their general aims. I don't really accept the rest of your argument either: you're still trying to show *why* they supported them whereas I'm saying the why is not that important.

&gt;You thought wrong.

So you accept that they had very widespread support? I'm glad we agree on that.

&gt;I don't doubt that at least a decent amount of people knew about the concentration camps -- but the thing is, a concentration camp doesn't exactly imply murder. I know what you think, but it is the way it is.

Yes thank you, I know the difference between a concentration camp and a death camp.

&gt;People assumed that the victims were merely incarcerated, to be used for forced labour, or to be moved to other places. It's still very much ugly, but it's not the same as murder. The whole idea of ethnic cleansing was almost entirely unknown to the bigger chunk of the population.

Again, debatable. See, for instance, *Backing Hitler*. Robert Gellately. [Or this rather fawning review from the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/feb/17/johnezard). An act on the scale of the holocaust would not have gone unnoticed.

&gt;To me, you sound like someone who would consider an act that happened long before the lifetime of some people as a legitimate enough reason to... ""round them up for their own protection"". Feel free to correct me, if I'm wrong.

You're very wrong yes. In fact you're more then wrong, you're flat out making things up if you think I was arguing that. I make no claims about the Germans of today - I do about the ones alive during the war. (And no, before you say it, I wouldn't support something like the OP.)

&gt; I'm disappointed to see that you indulge yourself in hate so much, and discussing a topic that has been discussed up and down for the past 70 years won't change anything in our world.

Who am I hating? I think the average German was a lot more culpable - and knew a lot more - then is usually assumed but I don't ""hate"" them. And you do realise that you accused me of wanting to """"round [the Germans] up"" (the ones who weren't even alive during ww2 no less) and then have the gall to get on your high horse and accuse me of ""indulging in hate.""",0,1365003469,null,0,false,0,c97p1cq,t3_1bevw5,t1_c97p1cq,t1_c979f39,null,1431687375,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Especially if you consider that the level of return illiteracy in Italy is also 46%: it means that these people are not able to read and comprehend a simple text. 
Italians read less than 1 book a year, and the use of newspapers is also 1/10 of a country with a similar population, France. 

Political parties in Italy are a corrupted trap, but they need to be reformed, not destroyed. As bad as they may be, they still constitute the only mean for simple people to participate in public life. As an italian blogger recently put it, very eloquently to me, if you cannot read and comprehend laws, economic policy and reforms, you go to party gatherings and you ask your neighbour to explain what they are saying, and reunion by reunion you get a little bit more than if you were left all alone in front of a text on a webpage, that you have no hope to understand.

But you are working under the assumption that a huge federation is necessarily the best for the citizisens. Do you have any proof for that? 

As a Swede, what I can tell you is that my voice, no matter the structure, will be less heard in the EU. The EU is also more corrupt than Sweden, so I can also make the assumption that more of my tax money will be lost to corruption. Plus, for working integration in the EU to occur, a *lot* more of my tax money has to be sent abroad. I do not feel that intimate with people that I want to send for example 20 % of my tax money (or is it more, how much is it in the US or example that goes to federal taxes) to other countries, just because ""we are all Europeans"". Fuck it, we are all humans, if I have to do it, I'd rather send it to people who are truly suffering, not to someone who chooses Berlusconi every time they vote. I also have no problems what so ever to say that I think my government (current and former) seems more competent than most of the EU's to deal with crises, not to cave in to  banks, balance a budget etc. Also, the last decade of the EU has proven, beyond any doubt, that the absolute majority of the people in the Eurozone (who are the biggest block) do not care, in any way, about following rules, laws and regulations. I do not want to integrate deeper with people like that, where one has to use threats just to make them follow rules that they have already signed. You do not seem to understand - a union is something that is supposed to be good, not something you have to force people in, or force them to follow rules. Then there is no union. 

You might say - stop being Swedish, think of the EU. But why? What can you offer me? I like my identity, and I, above all, am very sure that my voice is more heard now, and I am much better at influencing issues I care about now. 


So, as I see it - if you want to integrate in the Eurozone - please do, but leave us out of it. Frankly, I do not see any of you doing that either. Send half of your GDP south then, if you want it so bad, but I hardly see that happening.

true,JimmyLane,null,null,"&gt;Comment peut-on évaluer le besoin de barrières douanières pour raisons sociales et écologiques sans tomber dans l'arbitraire ? J'arrive à imaginer des métriques à peu près objectives pour le coté social (ratio entre les revenus moyens ou ceux du premier décile par exemple) mais j'en vois peu du coté écologique.

Le ""côté"" social n'aurait rien à voir avec ce dont vous parlez. Il ne s'agit pas tant de punir les régimes ou les pays avec une mauvaise répartition des richesses mais de faire partir en droits de douane les différences de coûts de production liés au système de protection social ie un pays sans charges patronales ou autres cotisations n'aurait pas, sur le territoire, une compétitivité-prix supérieure à celle de la France. Et pareil pour le coût écologique, on regarde comment on fait en France un produit équivalent et on extrapole. 

Nonobstant les difficultés pratiques liées à l'instauration d'une telle taxe au sein de l'OMC, je ne suis pas certain de la pertinence de ce genre d'outils.

Cela ne répond pas au problème de l'orientation de la politique industrielle de la France, ie des ingénieurs qui ne font pas de projets ou ne sont pas confrontés à l'usine ( l'ingénieur dans son bureau d'étude qui discute avec des usines dans d'autres pays, ou jeunes diplômés faisant directement du conseil ), ni au problème des industries obsolètes qu'on maintiendrait par ce système, ni au problème de la concurrence des pays développés avec un niveau de protection équivalent et qui sont plus compétitifs avec des prix plus élevés,  ni au problème de ce qu'on produira en France demain ie comment favoriser l'investissement et le développement de nouvelles industries, etc.

Et dans le même temps, cela pose aussi des questions sur la façon dont, en tant que citoyens d'un pays anciennement industrialisé et qui a bien spolié ses anciennes colonies, on accepte le rattrapage et la concurrence de pays développés. Le choix de ces populations est un rattrapage économique avec une protection sociale moindre ou une stagnation sans protection sociale aucune. Le patriotisme économique c'est aussi le refus de cela et je me demande si c'est bien compatible avec l'universalisme prôné par le FdG

&gt;Comment évalue-t-on la ""valeur d'usage"" ? La valeur marchande s'en veut une approximation, souvent assez fausse, mais qui a l'avantage d'être très facile à mesurer.

J'ai pas trouvé mention de valeur d'usage dans le lien fourni. Mais bon, a priori, c'est pour instaurer un contrôle étatique des prix ? Mouais.

Perso, moi qui suis plutôt sensible à une certaine rhétorique de gauche, j'ai trouvé ce texte décevant. Très réactionnaire ( de gauche ), très étatiste ( sur des sujets où à mon avis, l'Etat devrait faire preuve d'humilité ), trop utopiste ( les 4 ""R"" relocalisation de l’activité ( formule très vague, quelle activité, où la relocaliser, avec quelles personnes ), réindustrialisation écologique ( oxymore ), reconversion de l’outil industriel ( celui qui marche encore ou celui qui est abandonné dans des régions sinistrées ) et redistribution du travail ( lequel )"")  , presque malthusien ( anti-urbain, alors que c'est le mode de développement le plus adapté à des fortes populations contrairement au coûteux étalement rural ou péri-urbain qui est précaire, énergétiquement incompréhensible et difficile à pouvoir en services ).

Finalement c'est la vision de l'ouvrier pas trop qualifié, faisant un peu toujours le même boulot qui persiste. Entre ce texte et le 21e siècle, il y a un fossé immense.

&gt; faire partir en droits de douane les différences de coûts de production liés au système de protection social ie un pays sans charges patronales ou autres cotisations n'aurait pas, sur le territoire, une compétitivité-prix supérieure à celle de la France. Et pareil pour le coût écologique, on regarde comment on fait en France un produit équivalent et on extrapole.

Justement, je trouve que le calcul de ce genre de chose est suffisamment difficile pour qu'on cache une grosse partie d'arbitraire derrière l'algorithme de calcul. Utiliser le salaire moyen ou le salaire du premier décile est une approximation, mais elle a le mérite de fournir un algorithme plutôt clair qui rend difficile de dissimuler une complaisance à l'égard d'un régime.

&gt; Mais bon, a priori, c'est pour instaurer un contrôle étatique des prix ? Mouais.

Je ne suis pas sur de voir le lien entre avoir une politique industrielle nationale et contrôler les prix. La proposition n'est pas de créer une société soviétique.

Je ne suis pas non plus fan de ce texte que je trouve trop vague, mais je ne suis pas d'accord avec certaines de tes critiques :

&gt; trop utopiste

Pour qu'un programme aussi timoré apparaisse utopiste, il faut vraiment que l'espoir soit bas dans ce pays...

&gt; réindustrialisation écologique ( oxymore )

Il y a cette idée fausse qui se balade, qui dit que les industries sont nécessairement polluantes, qu'on ne peut pas industrialiser sans polluer et qu'on ne peut pas faire diminuer la pollution sans diminuer l'industrie. C'est simplement faux. Des normes écologiques peuvent à la fois stimuler l'innovation industrielle et le développement des services. 

&gt; Finalement c'est la vision de l'ouvrier pas trop qualifié

Même si c'est la notion de la ruralité pour tout le monde n'est pas ma vision préférée, force est de constater que niveau vision, y a pas beaucoup de partis qui en fournissent. Et cette vision là reste encore extrêmement limitée.

C'est drôle, je lisais du de Gaulle ce weekend (Mémoires d'Espoir) et c'est fou de voir comme la société s'est droitisé. S'il revenait aujourd'hui, avec son indexation des prix du blé, avec ses nationalisations et ses Plans (avec un grand P) industriels nationaux, il passerait pour plus à gauche que Mélenchon!

Alors certes, c'est une référence du passé, mais force est de constater que ""ce qui a changé"" depuis, c'est la libéralisation des différents marchés qui ont amené à la crise qu'on a en ce moment.

At the moment, as I already mentioned, governments I can't vote for are affecting my life far too much and the decisions in the EU are made without much transparency - heads of governments haggling in backrooms (just remember the last EU budget). The goverments get away with the breaking of rules because they are their own judge. A strong European Parliament would be able the counterbalance that.

&gt;  What can you offer me?

One thing the EU can offer is standardisation, making trade easier, cheaper products with uniform quality standards, etc. This also inculdes the common currency, even though it has serious flaws.

Similarly important is the barganing power in international treaties. Recent example: ACTA. Japan and the US wrote a draft and presented it to the European nations. Many nations, including Austria and Sweden signed the treaty immediately, against the will of the populace, because they saw no alternative. A small country can't have another legal framework than the rest of the world without dire consequences. The EU commission also signed it, btw. In the end it was the European Parliament which stopped it.

&gt; As a Swede, what I can tell you is that my voice, no matter the structure, will be less heard in the EU.

True. But following that logic, you should want that your village/city gets independent as well, because you have more influence on your communal policy makers than on the Swedish parliament.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;First of all, I agree with most of what you just said. I don't want to stop being Austrian, endure much corruption or send lots of money southwards. The thing is, I really don't like the status quo.

Well, I am sorry, but you have to do that if you get deeper integrated. Being Austrian will slowly melt away, of course, but I was more thinking about the perment transfers. That is how a good currency union works. I obviously understand that you do not like it, but you have to pick one of the two.

a) deeper integration

b) not send money south

You can have both. If you look at successfull currency unions there *needs* to be huge financial transfers. Look at the pound, the US dollar etc. Also, the economies have to be somewhat alike. It is Economics 101, sorry,. 

&gt;The thing is, I really don't like the status quo.

Nobody likes a depression, of course, but frankly, it is not like Sweden can solve it, or Austria. My suggestion would be to leave the Euro. Don't force everybody deeper in the mess.  

&gt;At the moment, as I already mentioned, governments I can't vote for are affecting my life far too much and the decisions in the EU are made without much transparency - heads of governments haggling in backrooms (just remember the last EU budget). The goverments get away with the breaking of rules because they are their own judge. A strong European Parliament would be able the counterbalance that.

Well, I agree to a point. I hate the rule breaking as much as you do, but at the moment, the EU gets 1 % of our GDP, and even though I want those money to be spent well, I can still live with it. 

I think it is much worse for you, since you have given up your currency, and every day you see the leaders of the Eurozone making moronic deciscions. Honestly, I feel for you, but there as you can understand - I do not want to join in. I see what you have - and I do not want it. In the end, that is the best argument for us outside the Euro, and the worst for you inside. 


&gt;One thing the EU can offer is standardisation, making trade easier, cheaper products with uniform quality standards, etc. This also inculdes the common currency, even though it has serious flaws.

Serious flaws - that is an understatement. I like having our own currency. I personally also believe our central bank looks out for the Swedish economy much much better than the ECB. Also, ECB has also shown that they are not interested in following rules, laws and regulations. I absolutely **refuse** to have anything to do with a central bank that do not care about the law. That is extremely unsafe and I think we are better off with a central bank that respect its mission(for example, you know that they are not supposed to support individual countries, but they do that all the time). Don't you? 

As for standardisation and treaties- one can get that anyway, a.k.a as ""Lex Norway"". 


&gt;True. But following that logic, you should want that your village/city gets independent as well, because you have more influence on your communal policy makers than on the Swedish parliament. I really like communal politics, but they are no substitution for nationwide rules. In a very similar way, EU-wide decisions, made by the European Parliament, can be complementary to nationwide decisions.


No, that is not necessary the case, not at all. I have never said I needed to go down to the smallest community, just that I do not want to be part of the ""EU federation"". I am fine with my village/city and how the regions are made up in Sweden. I am not fine with how it is made in the EU. Also, I am one of 9 million, in the EU I am one by 380 million (I believe). Obviously, the deal is better for me here. And, less corrupt, which is a huge deal for me personally. 

Honestly, the Eurozone  seem to have missed the most important point. *It is supposed to be beneficial to be in a currency union*. It is supposed to be desirable. Nobody seems to remember that. It seems like everyone is so used to depression and moronic desciscions that it seems to have slipped away. And, frankly - you need to change. Not us, not us on the outside - the Eurozone. Personally I think it would be better to break up, but if you want a federation with permanent transfers, that is obviously your deciscion. However, I do not understand how you are going to afford it. And, I am happy as long as we stay out of it. 

Also, for the EU. I am not even sure I want to be in the EU at all, and the points you are showing me are really not very strong at all. However, since it is not costing *to* much yet, I can live with it. However, don't you agree - it is supposed to be something attractive, not something you have to convince me to even stay in. Good unions do not have to do that. ",0,1365011003,null,0,false,0,c97rqy7,t3_1bi6oj,t1_c97rqy7,t1_c97r5i2,null,1431686027,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
