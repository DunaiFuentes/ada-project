One of the issues with money being such a huge taboo, in this situation, is that there might be cases where it is unclear whether the GF's parents are expecting to be paid back, for example after picking up the tab at a restaurant. My advice for this kind of case is: ask the GF, tell her you don't know whether you're expected to pay your way, and let her talk about it with her parents. Until you know exactly how they feel about discussing that particular topic with you, don't even touch it with a vaulting pole...

After the sowjets took offence at some reforms in the western occupation zones, they blocked these ways, which prompted the start of the famous (at least for berlin) Luftbruecke (air bridge), basically a massive air lift of goods into west berlin from british and US sectors (see http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Luftbr%C3%BCcke) for over a year until the blockade was lifted.

It's probably one of the largest airlifts in history (no idea, but I guess), with over 275.000 flights and 2.3 million tons of goods.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;That is so ridiculous, nobody piles up money, nobody hoards it around or takes it to the grave, everybody spends it sooner or later or they die and their heirs or somebody else spends it for them.
Anyway, the second that person spends his own money and either consumes or invests, they stimulate the economy by created the need for employment which then allow everybody, including those who are worse off, to climb the social ladder on their own without any need for government redistribution.

Surely they hoard it, and then ask interest from other people who haven't been as fortunate. That money was their reward for past productivity, using it as leverage to extract money from people who are trying to set up a business is double dipping. What's the difference between using a paper that says ""I'm a baron"" or one that says ""I'm rich"" to justify extracting wealth from average people and businesses?

&gt;owever, if you consider that government can't spend that which it doesn't have, that all government spending will sooner or later have to come out of the disposable income of the individuals within a society

So does all interest.

&gt;then it acts as a zero sum game, you either spend a lot but also tax a lot or you spend and also tax very little.

Are you telling me the economy is a zero sum game? :)

&gt; you either spend a lot but also tax a lot or you spend and also tax very little.

I mostly wonder where was the solidarity after the USSR ceased to exist?
Eastern Europe was in ruins, but I haven't seen much talk about solidarity back then.
And I honestly think, that those Eastern Europeans would have deserved those 100 of billions € more than any EZ member right now. 

Yet it was perfectly fine to let them suffer until they get out off their misery by themselves? Where was the difference from now?

I also must have missed the solidarity when Germany had its Reunification, too. 
If I remember it correctly Germany underestimated the cost of Reunification greatly and asked its friends if it would be acceptable if Germany would temporally pay less into the EU budget. 
But our friends (especially our Spanish one) denied us even that.
Germany didn't asked for money they simply wanted to pay less (temporally!) and even that was not acceptable! 


Scandinavians and the Dutch also had to do (painful) reforms AFAIK.
There was no European solidarity, too.

The willingness to help our friends would be bigger if the Club Med would have shown some solidarity with other countries themselves in the past.
They had more than 1 chance to do so.

So why exactly should I feel the need to help my *friends*? 
Because they are so creative with insulting me?

In den letzten Jahren, hat sich auf großer Ebene ein Flatratemodell etabliert. Die Kunden wollen ""unbegrenztes"" Internet, etwas anderes ist ihnen nicht zu vermitteln. In Verbindung mit dem Preiskampf, dem langsam gesättigten Markt und dem Drang zu mehr Bandbreite, [brechen die Umsätze der Provider](http://imgur.com/Af5XXpc) ein. Was übrig ist, wird [nun möglichst wenig in den Ausbau der Netze gesteckt](http://i.imgur.com/EoFuLJW.jpg) ([siehe auch](http://imgur.com/ShSSrKA)), um mehr Gewinn zu generieren. Was folgt ist eine Überbuchung der eigentlichen Kapazitäten. Das spiegelt sich darin wieder, dass sämtliche Tarife ""bis zu"" Bandbreiten anbieten, die von den tatsächlichen oft stark abweichen. 

Da nun aber durch neue Nutzungen des Webs, wie (HD-)Streaming, IP-Telefonie und digitaler Distribution von Medien im allgemeinen, die User langsam in der Masse ihre bestellten Bandbreiten auch nutzen, leidet die Qualität der Anbindung. Die Netze werden schlichtweg überlastet, weil die für den aktuellen Vertrieb maßgeblichen Kalkulationen versagen. Die Antwort ist einerseits Quality of Service, wie Kabel Deutschland es macht. Spezifische Dienste wie IP-Telefonie und IP-TV werden bevorzugt, andere hinten angestellt. Manche sehen das als Bruch der Netzneutralität, andere sehen es als pragmatische Lösung, die Qualität bestimmter Dienste zu sichern.

Schwierig wird es bei ca 0.5% der Nutzer. Diese Power-User reizen ihre bestellte Bandbreite aus. Dabei ist nicht der Traffic das Problem, sondern ihre konstante Nutzung einer Netzkapazität, die von den Providern an 5 Kunden verkauft wurde. Der Schluss ist, aus den Flatrates möglichst versteckt Volumentarife zu machen. Daran hat man die Kunden durch die Mobilnetze, wo besagtes Volumen mitunter gerechtfertigt ist, schon gewöhnt. Die Grenzen setzt man vorerst so, dass 99% der Kunden es nicht bemerken. Auch ist wahrscheinlich, dass die Volumen vor allem P2P betreffen werden, und surfen, IP-TV und co unbelastet bleiben (siehe auch hier Kabel Deutschland).

Im Grunde genommen habe ich zwar ein Problem mit fehlendem Netzausbau, aber keines mit Volumentarifen, so lange man den PowerUsern die Möglichkeit gibt, die Grenzen durch Zahlung von einem (angemessenen!) Betrag zu überwinden. Eventuell ist die Rückkehr der Volumentarife ja auch nur ein Mittel, den Preiskampf loszuwerden, der den Providern die Luft abschneidet.

Don't be too quick to dismiss certain cognitive processes as being ""illogical"". The following example is not about the logical methods employed in conversations, but the same idea applies here as well, I believe.

Take the well-known [Wason selection task](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wason_selection_task). Until recently it was supposed to be common knowledge that test subjects ""failed"" to reason logically in it. They certainly did fail if we assume they tried to reason according to classical logic. However, that's a pretty big assumption. Unless you categorically reject any formal logic system other than classical logic, we don't have enough evidence to declare they didn't use *any* logic to arrive at their conclusions.

Furthermore, the traditional way to look at reasoning tasks is to ""fix"" the logical system that we assume is required by the task, and then calculate the correct answers the subjects should give. This misses one crucial distinction though: that the human subjects confronted with a task have to decide for themselves (intuitively) which logical system they need to employ to solve it. In the words of Stenning and van Lambalgen:

&gt;We therefore view reasoning as consisting of two stages: first one has to establish the domain about which one reasons and its formal properties (what we will call 'reasoning to an interpretation') and only after this initial step has been taken can one’s reasoning be guided by formal laws (what we will call 'reasoning from an interpretation').

There's a couple, like *doing* stuff and having more.

When you do polls usually 70% say that they'd continue working, probably a bit less hours but broadly comparable, and around 80% say that only 30% would still work, at all.

In the end, psychology has the answer: To get people to still be productive, you need them to be a) not depressive and b) be embedded in society. That's rather easy to ensure (not for problematic individuals, but for broad society) by proper low-threshold incentives. Like, get a bonus on your basic income grant for visiting/organising a cooking or painting course. Or a reading circle. It doesn't really matter, just do something with others.

&gt;The Unconditional Basic Income (UBI) does not replace the welfare state but does complete and transform the same from a compensatory into an emancipatory welfare state.

I admit, that does sound overly ambitious, but it's also ambiguous and I can't decide whether it actually means to add to the existing social spending or just replacing it with a different model.

If it's the latter, it'd certainly be in favour of it. It combines the core ideas of socialism and libertarianism as it is intended for everyone regardless of their social status and at the same time, everyone gets personal freedom to decide what to do with the money they receive.

And don't be concerned about there being no obligation to work. That is actually a good thing. We're already facing a Europe wide job crisis. This would leave the jobs to those who are willing to do them, which increases productivity, job performance, and overall hapiness. It'd also encourage people to pursue otherwise poorly payed professions that have high social returns.

I also don't think this is as far-fetched as some believe. I'm sure a lot of the skeptics 70 years ago were calling the idea of welfare-state utopian and not being able to work for another 200 years.

EDIT: Oh, I forgot to add one more thing. If you go to the sign-up link, it says that the initiative is urging the EU Comission to encourage member states to cooperate in UBI research.

Your opinion is wrong, I'm afraid. ;)

The UK's economy is different by a *large* margin — for one thing, it isn't based on tourism like the Greek one. The UK has a sizable globally involved financial sector. The UK has a strong manufacturing sector. The UK has North European standards of bureaucracy (that is, very low levels compared with the south).

Also, ""roped into the Euro"" — come on. It's a decision made by democratically elected peoples or even the voting populace themselves. Nobody is being forced to be part of anything they don't want to be part of — for smaller economies, there are some quite significant benefits to it, which is why Denmark, being outside the Euro, still pegs its Krone on the Euro at a fixed exchange rate, effectively being an independent currency only in name, and not having any say in European monetary politics. Before the Euro, Denmark did the same against the German D-mark for exactly the same reasons.

But back to the UK: The UK economy, as outlined above, is *very* similar to that of the rest of North-Western Europe. There is no reason to think that it wouldn't benefit hugely from the same policies that benefit Germany, Netherlands, Finland, France, etc.

its counterproductive to remove social aid when one reaches sufficient income to not need it. Because that means your actual gain of being employed, and hence incentive to do so, is lessened, by the amount that was retracted.

One can slowly roll it out, to minimize the effect, but obviously the strongest and simplest solution if you wish to offer any social aid, is for everyone to get is with no conditions. Its also a simpler way to have proportionality in your income taxes w/o (any or at least as much) explicit gradation and arbitrary thresholds. Because for those that earn sufficiently, its just a tax deduction.

Milton Friedman in fact supported just such a scheme.

I think a limited income of this kind (certainly not something nearly sufficient to afford typical living standards of others) in combination other universally provided social services (eg free education, free healthcare, public shelters, public kitchens), is less likely to have negative effects on motivation to be employed than targeted aid.

true,FrenchyDude,FRAN,France,"Same here, but my vote for Hollande was only to avoid getting stuck with sarkozy for another term..                
I knew he was the kind of politician to change his mind everytime he's afraid of loosing points in popularity, but I did not expect him to decide to go to war, which I believe is mostly motivated by the public opinion that he's too ""flamby"" to do anything (too soft?).             
I really hope that the trial against sarkozy gets him convicted, thus avoiding any chances he might pass in the next election. I'm also a bit lost, not knowing if the trial will lead to anything since I've always seen him as ""untouchable"", he protected his ass while in office, and I hope that won't be enough.              
From the moment he lost against Hollande, I had the feeling we would see him again run for president (even though he said he would not go back into politics). That interview where he said ""well, I might get back into the race for presidency, because the french people need me"" made me really angry, and earlier today when every UMP politicians went on TV to say that the judge was wrong, that they're ganging up on him, that he's the victim, I knew they were all preparing for his return..               
He's a liar, there are many exemples, but the most recent would be when he said he had only been to the Bettancourt's house once, and was confronted on it by the staff saying he'd been more than once, he did not deny it, said nothing. That's pretty much an admission of guilt in my book.           
The worst thing about this is that many are still seing him as a great leader, that he did great, ... They can't see past the facade he's put up. I'm really afraid he's going to manage to come back, and I don't know why, but I get the feeling that he's to be put in the same bag as hitler (I know, making that reference on the internet is low), but it began with a seemingly normal guy, making a people believe him and making the people as bad as he is..             
That's low, I know, but it's kind of a gut feeling, or maybe it's just a fear..            
/rant..                  
               

Anyway, I don't know much about UK politics, but it seems to me that it's almost the same in the US as here, it's more of a ""avoid the worse"" voting system, with a lot of lobbys trying to get what they want, but I think it's the same here, only the lobbys are hidden behind some other people, giving money and expecting the future president to do as they wish in return..            
If I wanted to see a puppet show, i'd go to the circus, but that's not what I expect from people ruling a country..

Further, many of these accounts belong to businesses, and more than 100 of them show balances less than €100.000 (savers' guarantee). Many people now carry the stigma of being ""in the list"", while they've done nothing wrong. Being ""in the list"" became synonymous with wrongdoing. Some people in this list could be tax-evaders, but the authorities should establish links between their tax status and financial activity before accusing them. Having an account in a foreign bank is not enough evidence. Also, even if Greece taxed all the people in this list, its coffers would not feel any significant weight. I'm not saying this in order to justify what some of them might did, but the problem is inflated by those playing political games.

Prague: 2-3 days, can be more but if you just want to make a stopover, 2 or 3 days should be sufficient.

Berlin: As much as you like, but at least (!) 3-4 days: One for the west, one for the east and one for the center. It'd recommend 5 to 7.

Hamburg: Probably 2-3 days, it's a bit the Munich of the north imho. Just with worse weather.

Other places worth visiting:

* Dresden (2-4 days): East Germany's gem and a very important city for germany's culture.

* German alps (south east, bavaria)

* Wattenmeer (north sea coast) and the northern coast

* The Rhine-area (Germany's vineyard and full with castles, also Cologne) in Germany's west. The area between Freiburg and Karlsruhe isn't as littered with castles as the more northern regions, allows for an easy trip into France (e.g. Strasbourg) though.

* The Lake of Constance (big lake for european standards, on the cross between Austria, Switzerland and Germany)

* Our neighbours Denmark, Netherlands, France, Switzerland and Austria (Salzburg!)


The standard mode of payment in Germany is cash or EC-card (basically your bank-card). Cash is I think still more prevalent, but EC card is quite oftne used for groceries, large purchases, train tickets etc. Credit cards are a rather rare phenomena (few people have them unless they travel to places like the US). Most large-ish places (e.g. train ticket vending machines, hotels) should accept a credit card though. I'd recommend carrying some cash though just to be safe when a place doesn't accept cards. I'd say one or two days worth of cash-reserves should be fine, maybe 100 EUR, esp. if you make the major purchases (e.g. train passes, hotels, car rentals, ...) in advance. There are LOADS of ATMs , esp. in the city centers. Check if your bank has an agreement with a german bank for free cash withdrawal (I think BoA has one with Deutsche Bank) as this would probably be the most convenient way. Cash exchanges are fairly rare outside of airports.

Germany in general is a fairly safe place. Still use common sense when travelling (do not leave valuables out of sight, wallet in the back pocket is stupid, ...).
Concerning violent crime: Weapons (esp. guns) are very rare in Germany as the police will rain fire on your ass. The worst that can happen (usually, exceptions apply) is getting your nose broken. Most violent crime involving strangers is alcohol fuelled, so (again, common sense) be cautios when dealing with drunk young males (or their female companions).
'
There are no real no-go areas in Germany, though there are some quarters in the big cities that I'd avoid walking through at night (can't think of any though). If you happen to be non-white, areas in the east (more prevalent in the rural areas) are more likely to have some nazis, so use extra precautions when travelling in these areas (if you are non-white). Berlin shouldn't be an issue.
Unless you are posing a threat (or are involved in a demonstration), german police in general are nice and helpful, esp. when compared to the US.

Concerning other areas: As usual, big cities attract more crime than more rural areas. Prague is a place where I'd use a bit more common sense (it's not bad at all, just offers more opportunities to get into trouble).

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"&gt;Fucking bullshit, that's the same as saying ""there's plenty of modern democratic countries that don't allow for gay marriage so it should be banned"".

I don't understand what you're saying here.

&gt;What about the politicians, are they not just as uninformed or misinformed about issues?
That's an argument strictly against democracy, it's essentially saying ""the people are stupid and can't think for themselves so we'll decide for them"".

Many of them are, but compared to the average citizen, they know quite a bit more about governance. This doesn't mean they're morally superior. It's just that I would prefer to keep a professional political ""class"" if you will, rather than random people picked off the street and put them in charge of governing a country.

&gt;Of course not in every issue, only in the issues the people want to have their voices heard. If Latvians didn't care, then it would be fine, but if the majority is clearly against it, why the fuck would you ever impose it on them?

How do you decide which issue the people want to be heard on? There are a lot of people who want to severely restrict immigration for specific ethnic and religious groups. There are people who want to restrict the rights of gays and transgenders. Dabbling in direct democracy too much can lead to tyranny of the majority, which is one of the reasons why most countries don't use referendums often. Just ten years ago, the majority of people in the United States wanted to ban gay marriage. If there was a public referendum held on that, it would have been banned in all fifty states and DC. At least some states allow gay marriage at present. Similarly, California uses public referendums extensively. A few years back, the public voted to impose term limits on state government representatives. This has made California's government dysfunctional. People who write a law are then kicked to the curb, making it so that the new legislators don't understand the law's function or intent. Additionally, it's undemocratic. In a representative democracy, you should be able to vote for the same person to represent your district/state/country as many times as you want. Term limits are a terrible idea in almost every aspect, yet the public supported them because it's a popular talking point.",0,1363995833,null,0,false,0,c90p2al,t3_1atcnz,t1_c90p2al,t1_c90olgp,null,1431673157,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Nineteen men – 15 from Saudi Arabia – did, and there was no imminent threat that Afghanistan would attack the US or another UN member country.

You can also apply for a so-called 'popular housing': you get put in a queue depending on your income and needs and once a designated house is available you get it for a very cheap rent or for free.

If you are unemployed (and not for being fired with due cause) you can get some aid money as long as you register with employment centers and accept whatever work they find for you. If you refuse a job you lose the aid.

Another form of aid is the 'cassa integrazione': if a company is in trouble it can ask for help and 'suspend' some employees. They will get (reduced) wages paid by the state while the company tries to right itself up.

In some cases you can also get 'family support' money, depending on your job and the state of your family.

Rquirements mostly involve getting your income and family make-up certified. The whole thing can be complex, but there are several help centers, usually mantained by unions, than can take care of most of the forms and help you along.  

Unfortunately the last few years have hit the budgets hard, so many benefits are being reduced or cut. Many towns are struggling to fund all these programs, and so is the state as a whole, so it might be very hard to survive on aid money alone.

The once mighty industrial base withered away. This is a long story, I can expand on this.


Nominal average wage does increase but the real wage (adjusted to consumer prices) keeps stagnant for last decade (a relative success, during 90s it went down). [Statistics (in Czech).](http://www.finance.cz/makrodata-eu/trh-prace/statistiky/mzda/)


The export part of the economy is powered by low added value manufacturers who didn't found someone cheaper yet (e.g. Foxconn which moved final assembly of computers here from Ireland).  The high-value industry with own R&amp;D mostly disappeared (Skoda Car is notable large exception).


The debt was around 15% of GDP in early 90s (and slightly decreasing). It is now over 43% and growing very fast in recent years. [Czech wikipedia page with graph](http://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%A1tn%C3%AD_dluh_%C4%8Cesk%C3%A9_republiky)

Drinnen saßen stehend Leute,
schweigend ins Gespräch vertieft,
als ein totgeschossner Hase,
auf der Sandbank Schlittschuh lief.

Und der Wagen fuhr im Trabe,
rückwärts einen Berg hinauf.
Droben zog ein alter Rabe
grade eine Turmuhr auf.

Ringsumher herrscht tiefes schweigen
und mit fürchterlichem Krach,
spielen in des Grases Zweigen
zwei Kamele lautlos Schach.

Und auf einer roten Parkbank, 
die blau angestrichen war,
saß ein blondgelockter Jüngling
mit kohlrabenschwarzem Haar.

Neben ihm ne alte Schrulle,
zählte kaum erst 16 Jahr,
In der Hand ne' Butterstulle,
die mit Schmalz bestrichen war.

Droben auf dem Apfelbaume,
der sehr süße Birnen trug,
hing des Frühlings letzte Pflaume
und an Nüssen noch genug.

Von der regennassen Straße
wirbelte der Staub empor
und der Junge bei der Hitze 
mächtig an den Ohren fror.

Beide Hände in den Taschen
hielt er sich die Augen zu.
Denn er konnte nicht ertragen,
wie nach Veilchen roch die Kuh.

Holder Engel, süßer Bengel,
furchtbar liebes Trampeltier.
Du hast Augen wie Sardellen,
alle Ochsen gleichen Dir.

Und zwei Fische liefen munter,
durch das Blaue Kornfeld hin.
Endlich ging die Sonne unter 
und der graue Tag erschien.

Und das alles dichtet Goethe
Als er in der Morgenröte
Liegend auf dem Nachttopf saß
Und dabei die Zeitung las.

Some things I'd like to mention: the public opinion was that the Italian marines, while under trial, should never have been allowed to return to Italy, either for Christmas or for the recent elections. There was public outrage against the Indian Central government when the Italian government said that the sailors would not return to India for the trial.

As an Indian myself, I'd imagine that the verdict would least likely carry a death sentence, regardless of any diplomatic agreements, as the death sentence in India is reserved for ""the rarest of rare"" cases. Even in the event of a death sentence, the accused can appeal to the President for pardon.  

It has also been debated whether India had jurisdiction where the crime was committed, India claims that it happened in Indian waters, while Italy claims that it happened in international waters.

Although sensible, this violates basic EU principles of equality irrespective of the size of the country and its national economy

I think the main problem is their attitude and lack of effective communication. German leaders come across more like accountants when it comes to EU issues than politicians. I think this is the case with the EU in general; national politics seem to take priority over Europe. This is why unification of the banking sector for instance has taken so long. Every measure towards EU integrations means less power for national politicians.

Also, what adds to the problem is the fact that Germany is singled out as paying more, whereas technically it's the EU paying. The more German politicians speak about the need for bailouts and their terms, the less EU officials get to talk about them. So it ends up looking like a German and not an European project.

Finally, in all this the emphasis is on money. However, the EU is not just an economic union; it's primarily political and cultural.

It's just as annoying when Germans start nagging about how much they pay when no German fucking ever took a single look at some real numbers. It's just a *feeling* that is based more on what they are being fed by their national media more than practical realities.


Germans collect criticism and hate because they are very disrespectful, arrogant, and ignorant in times when millions of people in many countries have existential fears. It's going to get a lot worse before it gets better because the initial reaction of Germans is to be more arrogant and ignorant which is only more fuel for hate. I actually believe that's a good thing because I see a lot of Germans now looking at themselves and their magnificent assholishness, and rethinking their approach to others in Europe. It might be harsh but it's teaching Germans a lesson in respecting the others while at the same time it gives a chance for others to know who's their fried in the *happy* EU family. 

Angela Merkel is just as hated and [ridiculed](http://www.dickes-en.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/menopause_merkel-425x566.jpg) by at least 1/3 of Germans themselves. It doesn't mean a thing.

The way the bailouts are handled helps particular groups within the receiving countries and totally destroy others. They come with an agenda of deregulation and privatisation that absolutely destroys the social fabric and the economies of the receiving countries, which was not the best one to begin with. 

Furthermore, most bailout receiving countries cannot compete with Germany in terms of either quality of products or ability to produce. Thus direct competition (and a unified free market)  simply crushes them. If EU needs to continue existing, you need direct wealth transfers mechanisms from the more affluent countries to the poorer ones. You also need a state big enough to support directly people through providential structures, something the EU is categorically against. 

Thus, without any form of protectionism, half-working democracies and with bailouts helping mostly a corrupted elite most people in the periphery see their lives   with  no prospects whatsoever and need to funnel their anger somewhere.  The rational thing to do is an EU break up, and as I've said before, EU is like 1976 USSR, it has failed, but what else is there to do?

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Of course they had to join, because the government promised to join the euro area with the signature of a head of state, and later approved by the referendum. 

They promised to join a Euro where *the rules were applied*. Where *no one was bailing any one else out*. Where the debt was a maximum 60 % of GDP. The Euro they promised to join do not even exist any more.

&gt;. If you don't follow your promises and obligations, what good are you for, then?

Exactly. Why haven't any of the countries in the Eurozone (apart from Finland and Estonia) bothered to fullfill internation treateis? Why are they willfully breaking them? Why can't they do as they promised. *They* have caused this mess, *not* any other country. Shouldn't they actually begin to take responsibility and clean it up firsts? Where is the responsibility? If they regret it, they should fix it. If you mess something up, it your job to fix it. 

&gt;Because there were no mechanisms to give the power to the EU to actually allow to impose itself, if a country is violating the rules of a treaty. Now, with the fiscal compact and other treaties, EU has the power to even fine countries which are not follow the treaties. It's late, but better than never.

You do not seem to understand, the Maastrich treaty and the Euro convergence criterias *still applies*. One has only tightened up the rules, a bit, but how those are being followed, does still remiains to be seen. I am sure you have read the articles that France, who promised to follow them (as in at least attempting to go in the right direction)already are murmuring about not having to pay fines for their projected 3,7% deficit. 

And, as you understand, that *since the rules still apply* it means that *no one is bailing any one else out* and *each country is responsible for their own debt*. Are you saying that the Eurozone is following that rule? It is not what I am hearing on the news.

So, once again, the Eurzone has decided to maybe follow some of the rules, if it suits them., perhaps. We will see..

How the Eurozone, can ask anyone to join while still, *breaking the rules every single day* and still *demand* that countries join in a currency union that is the opposite of what they promised, and where **still** treaties are not worth the paper it is written on, is beyond understanding. 

But please, prove me wrong. I would love it. Are the bailouts stopping today (as written in the treaty). Is the ECB stopping buying individual bonds from countries to support them? Fines for everyone not heading in the right direction with their deficit, or with the debt? 

The fact is, that the Eurozone caused this mess by a) having an incorrectly constructed Euro and b) not giving a shit about any rules. So, I think it is up to the Eurozone to fix it before telling anyone else to join.

true,khthon,PORT,Portugal. Exit. EU. NOW.,"United Europe means financial solidarity. If you're not interested in that, then why even create a EU in the first place? Why the common currency? 

As Portugal provides for it's poorer regions, so do the richer countries need provide for their poorest neighbors. And richer incomes are taxed  more (or at least should) to help those poorer. It's a basic principle that almost everyone now wants to end, so as to protect the rich and this dangerous social asymmetry. 

* The EU meant money, which was indirectly given to Northern companies and banks. It meant a new market to these companies. A win/win situation. Now, in retrospective, it meant a playground, where they could corrupt and unlock subsidies/EU cash. And debt was encouraged because it meant profit for the banks. Regulation was relaxed and little or no audits were made by the many EU institutions designed to oversee them. 

* Agreed that we must contribute proportionally with our share. No one refuses that. But at this moment, with the current clusterfuck, it's very crippling. 

* Should we compare ourselves to Somalia also? Yes, Eastern countries have it worse but it's all about prospects of change. They are growing and there is economic health. They are not in decline. Besides, you can't even compare them. Why would you even bring that up? You have a two patients. One is quickly and positively recovering from grave illness and the other is worsening and on soon to be on a lifeline. Who would worry you most? Again, prospects is what counts.

* That's a grey are. Overall, we didn't. And we blame ourselves for letting corruption take hold. But there was very little control/regulation on the part of the EU. That happened because corporate and financial interests at play didn't want that. The same logic that still allows tax loopholes, offshore banking, different tax rates across the EU, laxed regulation. And our markets were subsidized to become dependent from outside help. Again, those corporate and financial interests at play. We gave up farming. We gave up fishing. We gave up textiles and some manufacturing. We gave access to our natural resources and exclusive economic zones. In turn, we'd import from other stronger EU countries. Now, with current interest rates and rising cost of logistics, food and other goods are too costly to import. Oil is more expensive. Our dependency of foreign imports hurts the deficit.  The interest rates paid to banks are high but that suits them. The bailouts also go back into those same banks and corporations that feed our small country. 15 or even 30% interest rates are a very appealing prizes. There is no interest in our recovery. Only in now reforming our country. Privatizing essential areas like water, energy, even health and social security. These are the Troika demands. And other EU and non EU companies  are buying these up at garage sale prices. Much like the former USSR in 1990. Northern economies still have financing. Their companies pay low interest rates for credit and can afford their way into our weak and now cheap country. We have no credit lines. Our economy is depressed. We take what we got. And our companies are dying at alarming rates because money just isn't accessible to them. 

This is the death of a country. And all of this happens because corporate interests trumps EU ideals. We're becoming colonies and our people slaves. 

Now, people higher in the North, believe this is a problem exclusive to Southern Europe. It isn't. We were just the weakest link. The game continues. Other countries will capitulate to those same corporate and financial interests, even mighty Germany. This EU is owned. The EU is dead.

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;I don't understand what you're saying here.

I'm saying ""there is a very good reason why modern democracies are representative democracies rather than direct democracies"" is meaningless.

&gt;Many of them are, but compared to the average citizen, they know quite a bit more about governance.

They're still just as clever as the ordinary Joe.

&gt;It's just that I would prefer to keep a professional political ""class"" if you will, rather than random people picked off the street and put them in charge of governing a country.

You're a random person picked off the street, does that invalidate your views as an individual?

Are you telling me ""oh, we can't let random people decide what's best for a country, what do Latvians know about joining the euro? oh, we do need the wise politicians to lead them in the right directions and do what's best for them whether they want it or not!""??

&gt;How do you decide which issue the people want to be heard on?

Easy, in the issues the people petition and try to held a referendum. Again, look at Switzerland.

&gt;There are a lot of people who want to severely restrict immigration for specific ethnic and religious groups. There are people who want to restrict the rights of gays and transgenders.

There are a lot of politicians who want to severely restrict immigration for specific ethnic and religious groups. There are politicians who want to restrict the rights of gays and transgenders.

There are a lot of people who want to facilitate immigration for all ethnic and religious groups. There are people who want to grant equal rights to gays and transgenders.

&gt;Dabbling in direct democracy too much can lead to tyranny of the majority, which is one of the reasons why most countries don't use referendums often.

And ignoring the will of the people leads to tyranny of the minority ruling class. Your arguments against direct democracy are ludicrous, sorry, they work just as well against democracy itself.

&gt;Just ten years ago, the majority of people in the United States wanted to ban gay marriage. If there was a public referendum held on that, it would have been banned in all fifty states and DC.

""I support democracy but only when most people support my views"" = ""I don't support democracy"".

Heck, even the most repressive of dictators are supportive of such a system, that's the opposite of being pro-democracy, that's using democracy when it suits you and trampling all over it when the people at large disagree with you.

Anyway, Portugal had two abortion referendums, [one in 1998](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_abortion_referendum,_1998) that failed and [another in 2007](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_abortion_referendum,_2007) that passed, now the issue is dead and the problem was solved. What about the USA, how's your abortion debate there? If direct democracy sucks so much, if the representatives need to impose on the people what's actually good for them, why are there still so many people there going on and on about abortion and how it should be banned?

From where I'm standing, sure, imposing things speeds things up but it doesn't solve the underlining issue whereas real democracy may take its time but is incredibly effective in actually dealing with the problem.

&gt;A few years back, the public voted to impose term limits on state government representatives. This has made California's government dysfunctional.

Then make a new referendum repealing it.

&gt;People who write a law are then kicked to the curb, making it so that the new legislators don't understand the law's function or intent. Additionally, it's undemocratic.

""Oh, democracy is so complicated, why can't we just decide things for ourselves and impose it on others?""

&gt;In a representative democracy, you should be able to vote for the same person to represent your district/state/country as many times as you want.

Here there are also plenty of term limits and we don't have a direct democracy. Besides, if you do think there should be no term limits, why don't you organise yourself with like-minded people and try to hold a referendum to abolish those? Oh right, you just spent a lot of your time arguing against direct democracy.. oh well, I'm sure your representatives will fix that for you just as well :)

&gt;Term limits are a terrible idea in almost every aspect, yet the public supported them because it's a popular talking point.

You know what's really a terrible idea? Arguing against direct democracy because you think the people at large are stupid.

One is quickly and positively recovering from grave illness and the other is worsening and on soon to be on a lifeline. Who would worry you most?

The difference is clear, we keep on playing the socialist game whereas they're focused on allowing the market to operate freely.

&gt;We gave up farming. We gave up fishing. We gave up textiles and some manufacturing.

We still have plenty of those and some of it heavily subsidies by the EU.

&gt;We gave access to our natural resources and exclusive economic zones.

What, you think we should restrict that just like they never restricted theirs to us?

&gt;Oil is more expensive.

Would be much more expensive with the escudo.

&gt;Our dependency of foreign imports hurts the deficit.

So you'd restrict imports and go full protectionist and mercantilist?

&gt;The interest rates paid to banks are high but that suits them. The bailouts also go back into those same banks and corporations that feed our small country. 15 or even 30% interest rates are a very appealing prizes.

We agreed to those.

&gt;There is no interest in our recovery. Only in now reforming our country. Privatizing essential areas like water, energy, even health and social security. These are the Troika demands.

Those part of the recovery, they should have been privatised a long time ago, we'd have never got into the mess we're in with the public debt if we had kept our state small but no, ""hurr durr everything should be free"" that people such as you keep on spouting brought us this debt and now of course we completely fucked up the economy.

&gt;And other EU and non EU companies are buying these up at garage sale prices.

Then sell them higher.

&gt;Our economy is depressed.

And I'm depressed of hearing the same old bullshit policies which the socialists would implement for relieving the current pain - never mind that it was them and those policies that buried us this deep.

&gt;This is the death of a country.

Which we brought upon ourselves because even when the EU was giving us free money, we squandered it. Please do compare us with Poland and Estonia and the like, they came from much worse and are now speeding past us - when you realise that it's because we're still trying to cling on to the idea of the paternalistic state that should provide everything for us, perhaps then you and most people will stop supporting such short-sighted measures.

Not True. There were parts in Greek society (at least) complaining before the bubble. Parties voted against the Maastricht treaty. You can't generalise like that. 


&gt;   And during this crisis alone the EU have slashed Greece's debt by more than €40 bn, and given you about €130 bn in bailout money and aid. Not to mention the IMF loans of more than €240 bn.

Loans that are for creating a society that I DO NOT WANT, that benefit 3% of Greek population and are strangling everybody else. The same strangle in the lower classes that EU policies advocate and push for.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; United Europe means financial solidarity. If you're not interested in that, then why even create a EU in the first place? Why the common currency? 

No. United Europe means level playing field where the country of origin of a citizen or company doesn't matter, they can all compete under the same rules.

&gt; As Portugal provides for it's poorer regions, so do the richer countries need provide for their poorest neighbors. And richer incomes are taxed more (or at least should) to help those poorer. It's a basic principle that almost everyone now wants to end, so as to protect the rich and this dangerous social asymmetry. 

That was a false principle. What the society at large needs to do is to level the playing field by giving out opportunities, this applies to people, regions and countries. However if people, regions or countries fail to use opportunities provided to them, then it is their own fault and they need to take responsibility of it, if not then we have situation where there will eternal subsidies for failed.

&gt; The EU meant money, which was indirectly given to Northern companies and banks. It meant a new market to these companies. A win/win situation. Now, in retrospective, it meant a playground, where they could corrupt and unlock subsidies/EU cash. And debt was encouraged because it meant profit for the banks. Regulation was relaxed and little or no audits were made by the many EU institutions designed to oversee them. 

Nope. For small countries such as Finland the EU has meant a level playing field. It has meant that bigger countries haven't been able to subsidize their own industries and companies, that they haven't been able to prevent entry of foreign competitors via usage of legislation or via building indirect barriers of entry such as national technical standards. 

&gt; Agreed that we must contribute proportionally with our share. No one refuses that. But at this moment, with the current clusterfuck, it's very crippling. 

That is though luck. 

&gt; Should we compare ourselves to Somalia also? Yes, Eastern countries have it worse but it's all about prospects of change. They are growing and there is economic health. They are not in decline. Besides, you can't even compare them. Why would you even bring that up? You have a two patients. One is quickly and positively recovering from grave illness and the other is worsening and on soon to be on a lifeline. Who would worry you most? Again, prospects is what counts.

Somalia isn't EU member state. The reason to compare southern European situation to eastern Europe is that eastern Europeans in absolute terms have it worst, yes, economic indicators are better, but at the end of the day they have less money and less money means that you have less everything from consumption, housing, food, housing, etc.. Lets put some numbers here, lets compare GDP per capita figures from 2011.

* Portugal 22,359 USd
* Estonia 16,568 USd
* Latvia 13,618 USd
* Lithuania 13,262 USd
* Romania 8,875 USd
* Bulgaria 7,308 USd

All the Baltic countries had a big banking crash in 2008/2009, for example GDP of Estonia dropped over 5% in 2008 and then 13,9% in 2009, and unemployment jumped over 17%. However the Estonian state didn't need any bailout, they slashed all of their public spending, citizens endured huge hardship while all of the time they kept their currency’s peg with the Euro. So if the people of Estonia could endure it, and lets face it, even in better days their living standards were lower than in southern EU state, then why can't the same and more expected from southerners?

&gt; Again, those corporate and financial interests at play. We gave up farming. We gave up fishing. We gave up textiles and some manufacturing. We gave access to our natural resources and exclusive economic zones. 

It has been a global trend for the last few hundred years that value of agriculture had been steadily going down. In case of textile and manufacturing industries, the change that you described already happened in Finland in 80s and 90s just due to market changes. The fact of the matter is that with or without EU, South-East Asia and China produce textiles and low value manufacturing with much lower prices than we ever can. The only choice is to let industries go and concentrate on developing new markets and new industries. For example in developed countries there is a trend of lower paper consumption, now the Finnish and Swedish pulp and paper industries could either just die or develop and entry new markets such as biofuels and biomaterials that they are right now doing.

&gt; In turn, we'd import from other stronger EU countries. Now, with current interest rates and rising cost of logistics, food and other goods are too costly to import. Oil is more expensive. Our dependency of foreign imports hurts the deficit

That calls for increased entrepreneurship and opening up of the markets. For example again poorer countries like Estonia are in fast track of trying to entry more developed industries, Skype for example was mainly developed in Estonia.

&gt; Privatizing essential areas like water, energy, even health and social security. These are the Troika demands.

Energy and health market liberalization in the Nordics has meant more competition and keeping prices lower than they are in other European countries. Also commodities like water needs to run like private companies are run because if you don't bill at least the cost of operations from the end users, then you are effectively subsidizing them.

&gt; This is the death of a country. And all of this happens because corporate interests trumps EU ideals. We're becoming colonies and our people slaves. 

You might want to take a trip to Russia and especially places outside the big cities to see what happens to a country that for almost 100 years had no corporations.

&gt; Now, people higher in the North, believe this is a problem exclusive to Southern Europe. It isn't. We were just the weakest link. The game continues. Other countries will capitulate to those same corporate and financial interests, even mighty Germany. This EU is owned. The EU is dead. And it will end, badly.

true,[deleted],null,null,"They were both justified retrospectively:

**Afghanistan** - There was a direct attack upon the US by a foreign government supported and housed group, not going in was impossible, if we had not, that country would be the world's #1 terrorist haven and another 9/11 would have almost certainly happened.

It's worth remembering, that even the (rightly) furious US at the time gave the Taliban the option of turning over Bin Laden and the invasion would've been averted. That was a pretty measured response from a wounded and cornered beast, so war was actually the option of last resort.

On a more emotional note; the Taliban were arseholes and freeing the Afghan people was the right thing to do. Nothing is perfect but girls (and boys) get educated and live an infinitely better life in that country now.

**Iraq** - People have such a revisionist history on this, most people believed that they had WMD, politicians were operating on what was thought to be good intelligence, Saddam was breaking UN resolutions left right and centre, they wanted us to believe they had them.

Now there was certainly an element of confirmation bias there (people were hearing what they wanted to) and probably at least some ""unfinished business"" for Bush Jr. from his dad but this idea that it was some huge corporate conspiracy is just foolish; and has been disproven by the fact that we did not end up being the primary beneficiaries of Iraq's oil reserves by a long shot.

As for the evil ""military industrial complex"", of course defence contractors will earn money from a war but the numbers just don't add up, I think the largest American company got a 20% increase in yearly turnover worth about one week of waging the war, hardly an impetus to invade.

With all of that said, removing Saddam was *the right thing to do*, he was truly evil and anyone who tries to tell me how great and stable a leader he was is going to have me puke in their face.

Think about how Iraq would look right now if he was still in power, the chances are that the population would have started an uprising and been brutally crushed, it would look like Syria x10. It's hard to understand the concept of theoretical outcomes when you already know what you know but I truly believe that if we had not intervened that millions of innocents would've died and another genocide would have been committed. Nobody would've stopped him from levelling cities like we did in Libya.

On a less dramatic tense, Iraqi lives were miserable under Saddam, every aspect of their daily lives was gripped by an iron fist and despite all the problems they are now free and the green shoots are now there. What it boils down to is that in 20 years Iraq will still be a democracy and its people will decide their own destiny - how can you say they would've been better being systematically eliminated by an evil dictator?

None of that talks about the execution of it, which in Iraq's case was certainly shambolic (especially for us), some people think we should've gone in and come out ultra quickly which does make strategic sense but I'm quite proud of the fact that we didn't cut and run, took responsibility and began to rebuild. However imperfect, that was morals triumphing over mercenary tendencies.

Intervention isn't always right but we had no choice in Afghanistan and even though the initial reasons for Iraq were wrong, it was still morally right and I stand by that and my part in both.",0,1364046862,null,0,1364050350,0,c90yfec,t3_1ato8r,t1_c90yfec,t3_1ato8r,null,1431677651,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Apprezzo lo sforzo della Scotti e della Bolognesi, ma la Bosisio e la Stagni sono irraggiungibili per quanto riguarda Marge e Bart: non solo perché sono le voci storiche, ma anche perché sono vicinissime alle voci originali della Kavner e della Cartwright (era per quello che erano state scelte, quando il doppiaggio italiano era ancora sopraffino e, IMHO, uno dei migliori al mondo) - la distanza con le voci originali era quasi nulla, e l'unico anello debole (ma solo sulla carta, almeno fino a qualche tempo fa) era Accolla, la cui voce non è mai stata vicinissima a quella di Castellaneta.

Già, Accolla: secondo alcuni insider sembra che si sia rotto i coglioni di doppiare i Simpson e che continui solo per i $$$ (peraltro portando a casa non solo lo stipendio da doppiatore ma anche quello da direttore di doppiaggio), e questo andrebbe ad aggiungersi a non ben precisati problemi di salute. Basta questo a giustificare l'*enorme* tracollo che ha subito la voce di Homer negli ultimi due anni (ho visto solo un paio di episodi nuovi ma, cazzo, Homer era veramente irriconoscibile!)? Secondo me no, c'è sotto qualcos'altro - probabilmente beghe interne al mondo del doppiaggio italiano, peraltro un po' troppo self-referential.

L'abbandono di Mario Milita, storica voce di Abe Simpson (ora doppiato da Caprio, aka Peter Griffin - non lo si può sentire) per problemi alle corde vocali, non ha sicuramente aiutato.

As I wrote [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1amwve/comparison_of_the_banking_sectors_of_eu_countries/c8yuolz), that table is the result of some rough calculations I did for myself, but I thought that others might want to check it out as well. Newspapers make much noise but we could use some *real* data.

You can't really tell which ones are ""bad"", there are many factors that influence sustainability. As I noted in the table, the red ones are the ones above EU average. Cyprus compares favourably to Luxembourg in both indices (assets to capital, assets to GDP).

&gt; Back to Cyprus,you still haven't discussed the black money.

As a matter of fact I did, that's why I linked to the discussion in my previous comment. Let me copy some bits.

* ""I see no honest way to calculate what is the *real* percentage of non-EU money, because EU and non-EU countries and/or businesses might be used as intermediaries.""

* ""... there is no honest way to know the ultimate origin of the money. They might travel through various countries before they end up there. The same goes for money ending up in Switzerland or Liechtenstein. The important thing to remember is that there is a free market, and that businesses compete in a free market. So, one can't go around and say ""no Swedish money in Finland"" or ""no Russian money in Cyprus"". This doesn't work. Ultimately, the only countries that can investigate what their citizens do are the countries of origin. Sweden, Cyprus, or any other country does not have the legal tools Russia, for example, has in order to investigate alleged mobsters.""

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; I like many of your posts and comments, but I think that you have the tendency to jump into conclusions about what some people think -- or do not think.

Please do not underestimate me. I do not jump to conclusions; I painstakingly make as many observations as I can and try to draw the most probable conclusions. The fact that you have not seen me study the crisis and krattr's response to it does not mean that I have not done so. 

&gt; But when someone posts some numbers, it doesn't mean that (s)he agrees with every aspect of how the numbers came to be. 

My argument was not based on this singular submission; that would be stupid. 

&gt; As a matter of fact, OP was critical of the Troika's inability to comprehend that [...]

Of course all Greeks (among others) are critical over the obviously broken parts of the ""memorandum"". However, if one consistently misrepresents news to cast them in a positive light in relation to the outcomes of the bailout project, then to me they are committing a grave sin. You can't say ""the numbers don't work out"" and at the same time submit news about how Greece is making it and everything is turning out all right. 

If the programme is fundamentally broken, then things will go wrong. If the programme is good, then things will go well. If you say that the programme is bad but things are going well you are undermining your own argument. That is what krattr is doing: he submits half-truths and in doing so undermines his own criticism of the memorandum conditions.

&gt; Further, I recall past discussions where all Greeks here, no matter their political affiliation, agreed that nobody can throw anyone outside of the Eurozone. The Euro is not owned by a few countries, but is a common currency.

I do not agree with that. The ECB can threaten you that it will not provide liquidity to your banks. If the ECB stops printing money and sending it to your banks, then your banks go bust unless you print your own currency. It's pretty straightforward and can be arranged; it's actually happening with Cyprus right now.

&gt; It would be better to focus on more constructive approaches. The mentality ""us"" vs ""the others"", especially if the supposed ""others"" are among your own people is not helpful.

I *am* being constructive. Constructive criticism is a constructive approach after all. Sure, my tone is frustrated but that's because I've had some incredibly frustrating long discussions with the OP. In my mind, I'm just trying to reveal the truth. If krattr consistently tries to conceal it, I think I have every right to call him out on it, even if it seems harsh.

In the Great Depression the economy shrank around 20-25%. 

Greece is dealing with a full-blown Great Depression and they still have there dignity, if other countries such as your own were dealing with a Great Depression of this magnitude the entire country would go nuts.

Greek government betrayed its own people with the help of the northern Eu governments which were all giddy to give any type of loan, knowing full well that the interest rates would rise soon and greece would not be able to pay it off. Then when the economy fully crashed, the germans put in a puppet government and have been controlling things since. 

Do you not see how the citizens of a country would be angry if they see there country going into a Great Depression and then seeing a puppet government put in place? The greeks just see what the EU really is all about finally, nothing to do with Peace or euro-pride. It is about fear and control and putting the northern EU Bankers above all else.

true,khthon,PORT,Portugal. Exit. EU. NOW.,"Level playing field. A most vacuous reply sure to win the masses. It only means fairness in the rules, which is kind of an obvious and implied. So in essence, an open market with advantages mostly leaning towards the bigger/richer companies. Equality in treatment does not mean equality of success and the success depends not just on entrepreneurship and resourcefulness but also the economic and logistic backing of their own countries, access to lines of credit, entrepreneurial culture and experience and of course the lobbying might when deciding how bigger shares each country got. Portugal had very little influence or power.  

Lets talk about chances or probability to succeed... Portugal was hardly on favourable terms. Nowhere near the economic might to take on the competition. And it was never supposed to. Portuguese companies could only expect to outcompete others at market niches or outside the EU.

Btw: Fiscal and financial solidarity is not a false principle. It's a basic constitutional principle. You are certainly subject to it, unless you're some oligarch with money stashed in some offshore account. 

Society needs to level the playing field. What does that mean exactly? Fairness in accessing opportunities? How about the chances of succeeding? Do they get factored in? What are the chances of my company getting access to credit at sane interest rates when competing against German companies? Add to that that many are based in lower tax countries like Ireland or the Netherlands and with unregulated/untaxed money laundering through offshores? Taxes our country will never see. Ridiculous situations the EU turns a blind eye to. Does this cannibalistic approach mean a level playing field or a killing field? I think the latter..

And what are the chances of our children accessing education when Troika demands steep budget cuts that are pushing for higher tuitions, pushing young people away from education? Want to compare tutitions in Northern Europe against Southern Europe? How about the fairness in accessing health when old people are left to die from cancer because rational cuts took money for treatment and medication. Want to talk living costs?

And privatization has not improved through competition. Just the opposite. Where did you get that data?

What you mention essentially addresses nothing and at most is an Utopian vision of an homogeneous Europe that doesn't exist and likely won't. Leave your country and witness the despair caused by those out of touch with European reality. Go South if you want to see a dramatic decades long reversal.

You can keep bringing up Eastern European countries as examples but they have their own problems despite growth. The statistics are poorly made and much of the people's plight is muffled. Also, these statistics are being made by the same EU that failed to forecast the current problems. I wouldn't discard the plundering of fresh EU funds by unregulated and unchecked corporate assault. Much like what happened in Southern Europe. I wouldn't be surprised if many countries are buying up unneeded submarines, weapons and high priced infrastructure. That is the way of the EU. Channeling EU taxpayer money to these big players.

I don't see companies or corporations as enemies, I see the current EU and some heads of state as enemies of Europe. All this promiscuity and laxing of regulation is essentially cannibalizing Europe. Nonsensical tax policies. Corporate interests trump the necessities of the people. And if threatened, there is always the racism card to be used. Pit them against each other while we feast.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;The Euro isn't that badly constructed, but it does heavily favor countries with higher productivity and punishes those with lower productivity and this was known from the beginning. The plan was that to fix this flaw Nordic countries in general and Germany particularly would in effect make wealth transfers from the north to south as to prevent this exact problem, but that part was left unsaid, since giving money away was never going to be an election winning strategy.

That is badly constructed to me, that one ""forgot"" to calculate with the losses in internal competitiveness. Extremely bad. They knew it was going to happen, but choose to ignore it, because if they had said it (to north and south) it would have been a no.

. One also has to add, that apart from the *massive* transfers that will have to occur, we also need debt reconstructuring, fixing the souths banks, + massive investements - for several decades. Not taking that into account is extremely bad constructed.

&gt;Fast forward 15 years, the Euro is the currency of most countries in the EU, but the wealth transfers that would balance the trade sheets were forgotten.

The bad construction is part of the reason yes, but another reason is that the Euro countries do not care more about treaties/laws and regulations than they do about toilet paper. It wouldn't have stopped the crises (loss in internal competitiveness would have occured nevertheless) but it would not have been *as* bad, if for example Greece never had been let in (since it debt/GDP ratio was fake) - but still bad. So, not following treaties is an additional sin. And the fact that there is a world wide credit crises doesn't really help either.

Nobody asked Germany to give out money. It's a **loan** and Germany is participating proportionally in that loan as it should.

But right now they're sacrificing an entire currency union's credibility for peanuts. Peanuts that everyone's going to get back, eventually, at the expense of a small country which can only offer sunshine and a tiny service sector. They forget that we have neither the capacity nor the raw materials needed for a heavy manufacturing industry. For all this moralising about money laundering, you'd expect other countries to sort themselves out first, and then offer suggestions on how we can avoid starvation.

Not only that, they forced a member of that union to go begging to a loan shark, while also forgetting that Cyprus could be a much needed alternative to dependency from Russian gas. How do you thing all this bad blood will affect future exploration and drilling negotiations? That's right, let's give everything to the Israelis. This can only end well for a European country right in the middle of the shittiest, most combustible region of the planet.

You know what Putin was asking for in exchange for a tiny loan? First dibs on eastern Mediterranean gas reserves. Had our president accepted that, Europe would be vendor-locked in Gazprom's supply routes from all directions.

Can you see now why the EU has become the laughing stock of the USA, Russia and China? This couldn't have been handled worse. I cannot imagine how we're going to deal with Spain and Italy when (not if) the time comes. I fear for our future, both as a Cypriot and a European citizen.

&gt;But its ties to Russia are part of a far more difficult geostrategic conundrum Cyprus has presented to the EU since it joined the bloc eight years ago, as part of a deal to gain Greek support for including eight former Warsaw Pact members at the same time.

&gt;Most obvious has been its four-decade stand-off with Turkey, which invaded and divided the island in 1974. Cyprus has not only blocked progress on Turkey’s membership of the EU but it has prevented the EU from working more closely with Nato to co-ordinate European defence policies.

&gt;The EU had hopes of securing the island’s reunification as a condition of membership but voters in the Greek south rejected a UN-brokered plan – even as Turkish Cypriots backed it – earning the enmity of many in Brussels.

&gt;Chris Patten, the Briton who served as the EU’s foreign policy chief during the Cypriot negotiations, was quoted in a 2004 US diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks as saying he would “only want to dine with [Cypriot leaders] if you have a very long spoon”.

&gt;Mr Christofias made clear he did not view the EU presidency as a time for detente. He referred to Turkey as a “colonial power” and insisted Ankara had only taken a harder line since the Arab spring it helped inspire.
“There was a very serious turn by the Turkish leadership which became much harder, more cynical and more intransigent,” he said.

What does that say about respect? And, if you can not respect the rules, what is the next rule that is going to be ignored.

&gt; You are part of the problem, not of the solution.

You do not seem to understand what a currency union is. A currency union is supposed to be something *good*, something *beneficial. If one has to threaten and bully countries to join, then something is wrong with the union. A good start would be to actually to take a look at what is wrong with the *Euro*. To blame the current crises and the extremely bad constructed Euro on countries *outside* not only reeks of desperation, it also says that you have absolutely no idea what the problem really is. 

To give you a hint. With the construction of the Euro, it is Economics 101 that the cheaper countries with low productivity would loose in internal competitiveness. This is also what has happend, in fact, the Portugal/Greece/Spain lost up to 30 % of their competitiveness (measured in units of labour costs, Eurostat) up until 2008 (it is more now). To offset that the other countries would have to make massive, and permanent transfers, for decades, to the south. In addition to that, they also need their banks to be propped up, debt reconstruturing and of course, massive investments- for decades. Please compare it with another currency union, when DDR joined with BRD in 1990 to make Germany. Just as the GIIPS, DDR had lower cost/lower productivity, and immediately had a loss in competitiveness and high unemployment. Germany however transferred *trillions*, made sure they hade the basic social structure (hospitals, unemployment benefits etc) and made massive investments. In addition to that, the DDR had no foreign debt to speak of and the banks were safe. Still, 23 years later, the productivity and unemployment is still lower in (former) DDR, and Germany is still transferring over 100 billion to DDR, each year. 


None of that is happening to the GIIPS countries, so of course it is all going to hell. Add to that a bad bank save and a crises management straight out of  hell. To top it off, almost all countries in the EZ considers treaties something marginally less worth than toilet paper. The crises would have happened anyway, internal competitiveness (or loss in it) works that way, it is science, but it would have been less bad if the rules actually had been followed (for one, Greece wouldn't have been let in). 


Oh, and to top it off, a global credit crises.


It is this absolute mess, where basically no one is a) following the rules that they were supposed to follow, and they are not even intending to, years to come b) no one is actually trying to deal with the root of the problem, the incorrectly constructed Euro.

Instead, people are behaving like you, blaming it all on the Greeks, Germans, etc. Or, in your case, blaming it on the Swedes, which is, if you had half a knowledge of Economics, beyond ludicrous.

true,YaDunGoofed,ANAR,Black Square,"NOW, you have an argument!

&gt;Harold Wilson devalued and ranted about how 'the pound in your pocket' wouldn't change in value. It was followed by a decade of disastrous high inflation with British industries collapsing daily

You argue that Wilson devalued the pound to terrible effect. Yet:

&gt;In economic terms, Wilson's first three years in office were dominated by an **ultimately doomed effort to stave off the devaluation** of the pound. He **inherited an unusually large external deficit** on the balance of trade. This partly reflected the preceding government's expansive fiscal policy in the run-up to the 1964 election, and the incoming Wilson team tightened the fiscal stance in response. **Many British economists advocated devaluation, but Wilson resisted**, reportedly in part out of concern that Labour, which had previously devalued sterling in 1949, would become tagged as ""the party of devaluation"". In the latter half of 1967, however, an attempt was made to prevent the recession in activity from going too far in the form of a stimulus to consumer durable spending through an easing of credit, which in turn prevented a winter rise in unemployment.
After a costly battle, **market pressures forced the government into devaluation in 1967**. Wilson was much criticised for a broadcast in which he assured listeners that the ""pound in your pocket"" had not lost its value. It was widely forgotten that his next sentence had been ""prices will rise"". Economic performance did show some improvement after the devaluation, as economists had predicted. **The devaluation, with accompanying austerity measures, successfully restored the balance of payments to [surplus by 1969](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Wilson)** 

To sum up: He inherited an overvalued pound and was eventually forced to devalue it *due to market pressures*(despite him not wanting to), which restored the balance of payments within 2 years.

I would argue this devaluation was a success given the options and would have worked out even better if he had done it earlier. I think you forget that devaluation isn't done (usually) to simply fuck people out of their money, it's a necessary act to counter a negative balance of trade.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"&gt;Seeing how all other large empires have failed at some point or in some way or the other

I'd just like to point some thing out from a historical perspective. Nothing ever lasts forever. Not even the continents will last, nor will the earth. Just because some thing will at some point end does not mean it is a bad club to join. Additionally, no nation state (like Norway or America) has lasted forever and I doubt one will. Does this mean that Norway is a bad country? Obviously not. I hope you see my point.

Additionally I'd like to point out that the EU is in absolutely no way an empire. 

(Extract from the New Oxford American Dictionary)

&gt;1 an extensive group of states or countries under **a single** supreme authority, formerly esp. an emperor or empress 
empire (adj.)
: [in names ] the Roman Empire.

&gt;*  a government in which the head of state is an emperor or empress.
* a large commercial organization owned or controlled by **one** person or group : her business empire grew.
*  an extensive operation or sphere of activity controlled by **one** person or group : the kitchen had once been the ladies' empire.
*  **supreme political power** over several countries when exercised by a **single** authority : he encouraged the Greeks in their dream of empire in Asia Minor.
*  (archaic) **absolute** control over a person or group.

From this we can see that at least one but ideally both the attributes of a single body having control over the periphery *or* a governing body having *supreme* control over the periphery.

In the EU sovereignty and power is shared between the central body of the EU and the member states, with the member states holding absolute sovereignty in that they can leave at any time. Additionally the EU can only legislate on certain areas. So the EU does not match the criteria of an empire, though if you *really* want to try and distort the definition of the word, you could probably wedge the EU into it, if you really were trying very hard and cutting a lot of corners. But the EU does not easily fit because it has neither absolute power, nor is it vested in a single body as the member states make up a powerful part of the EU.",0,1364061366,null,0,false,0,c911xlx,t3_1ausrb,t1_c911xlx,t1_c90yffe,null,1431679304,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

The lack of consumer spending is the problem. They won't come close to being 'the next Euro meltdown' or whatever people might call it.

Unter dem Aspekt des Bezugs zur außersprachlichen Realität und unter Referenzaspekten werden fiktionale von nichtfiktionalen Texten unterschieden, Gebrauchstexte (pragmatische Texte) von
literarischen/poetischen Texten. Nach Jakobson dominiert in der Poesie die poetische Funktion der Sprache im Vergleich zur referentiellen. Das poetische Zeichen verweise nicht eindeutig auf etwas, sondern lasse sich in mehrfacher Weise interpretieren.
""Der Vorrang der poetischen Funktion vor der referentiellen löscht die Referenz nicht aus, sondern macht sie doppeldeutig."" (Jakobson 1972 (1966): 127)
Schmidt bezeichnet Fiktionalität als textsemantische Kategorie in
ästhetischer Kommunikation (Schmidt 1972: 64). Danach sind fiktionale Texte situationsabstrakt (66) und polyfunktional (67), sie ""enthalten Leerstellen, die von jedem Rezipienten anders ausgefüllt [. . .] werden können"" (67). Polyfunktional vertextete Textkonstituenten sind nach Schmidt ""strukturell polyvalent, d. h. semantisch unterdeterminiert, funktional überspezifiziert sowie pseudoreferentiell"" (70).
Beaugrande/Dressler kritisieren (unter Hinweis auf Weinrich 1966) die Gleichsetzung literarischer mit fiktionalen Texten, da es auch fiktionale Texte gebe, die nicht literarisch sind, z. B.

&gt; Why is it that Russian children, even the lazier ones, breeze along from letter blocks to War and Peace without having to sacrifice any valuable snowball-tossing time, while American children, and their teachers, struggle mightily but fail to succeed? The answer is obvious: it is the fault of the fucking English! Not the long-suffering English people, mind you, but of the aristocratic ponces and twits who have lorded over them for centuries, and who are responsible for contriving and perpetuating the ridiculous thing called the English “spelling system.” 

Orlov has also proposed a new alphabet for the English that fully grasps its phonological features [here](http://cluborlov.blogspot.com/2012/12/applied-anarchy-part-iii-design-phase.html). It looks [fascinating](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dmYr0uPPvm4/UMkLtWqA6GI/AAAAAAAADeQ/Z0w89RNbWWE/s1600/Jabberwocky.png).

true,[deleted],null,null,"Finnish is a rather interesting language and you can't really cover any of it in a post. 

-Depending on the dialect, we can have 15-17 cases (standard finnish (the language you'd write in) only has 15)

-We have tons of clitics that allow us to express the mood of any word in a sentence to an insane degree without needing to change our tone of voice at all (also makes written finnish more lively than written english, since english relies on tone of voice more). 

-We conjugate the word no in a negative verb. This combined with clitics means we have hundreds of possible words for the word no, each for a different tone and grammatical person.

-We have vowel harmony

-We have consistent spelling

-Pronouns are unnecessary half the time due to verbs as well as nouns and adjectives being able to refer to the party that plays some role in the sentence. ""Juoksin autolleni"" = I ran to my car. (Notice how there aren't pronouns there)

-Due to the way our grammar allows for modifying words to create nouns, verbs, adjectives, or whatever, our vocabulary is very logical (book = kirja, author = kirjailija, library = kirjasto, to mark down = kirjata, write = kirjoittaa , letter = kirje, etc) and lots of our words come from a smaller set of root words which then get modified to convey more exact meaning

-We have very free word order

-We have compound words, which allows me to create words like viestipalstakirjoitusaiesuunnitelmatoteutustapa, which is something I just made up to fit the setting (reddit)

-My dialect is one that resembles estonian in many ways with its shortened words and some grammatical features. Lots of our vocabulary is also loaned from english, and relatively new grammatical features have popped up due to english having an influence here.

-Most words have tens of thousands of possible forms depending on the role of the word in the sentence. This is because of cases, clitics, and all the possible derived forms you can make from any word.

-We have perhaps the most versatile profanity out there. The word vittu (literally means cunt, loose translation is fuck) can form glorious sentences like ""Vitun vittuilijat vittuilee vittuilijoille vitusta vitun vitutta vittujen vituissa vitun vittuilulla vituttavasti vituttaen vittuilijoita vitutellen vituttavia vitun vittuilijoita"" (you could go on forever)",0,1364069300,null,0,1364070301,0,c9144r2,t3_1avedj,t1_c9144r2,t3_1avedj,null,1431680338,49,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,49

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"Whilst I agree that the written and spoken forms of English are extremely different I don't strictly speaking see this as a bad thing. It makes it harder to learn for those who learn to speak first and then to write. However, it allows for a deeper understanding of what's been written. English words are often made up of lots of little chunks: Suffixes, prefixes and usually some Latin, Greek or French in the middle. Whilst our pronunciation of the prefix, middle and suffix will not reflect spelling, it does allow us to gain a deeper understanding of the meaning which might be lost if the language was written purely phonetically.

Additionally, if we were to write purely in phonetic terms, it means that the written form would change at a near constant speed. This is how language works. Having a standardised spelling system ensures that any English speaker can always be understand, so long as they are using the same dialect (note: dialect =/= accent). When I speak I can pronounce these words in all manner of ways, but when they are spelled they are spelled one way. That one way will be universally understood. If you speak, then you will not be universally understood. 

We've had a standardised spelling system for some thing like 300 hundred years. These sorts of problems are bound to arise and it's amazing that it's only as bad as it is. But even in the next 300 years, I'm not sure I'd change it.

As such, Frisian is a separate language from Dutch, but has underwent - a lot- of Dutch influence of course. Many think that Dutch has a lot of influence from English, but it hardly compares to the influence of Dutch in Frisian. 


In-post edit; I now notice you say ""of BEING Frisian vs Dutch"" rather than about the language. &lt;_&lt; Oops. Difference in that case is minimal.

* During the Middle Ages the Arabic-derived words in the mix above words was higher than today, mainly because the concepts were specific to the situation in the Peninsula and have since then either disappeared, been replaced by Latin words or became less well-known (example: in Brazil they still use the word ""almoxarifado"" for a common stocking area, whereas in Europe we use the terms ""economato""... note that ""almoxarifado"" is derived from a territorial division in the Middle Ages and related to the word ""xerife"")
* During the Renaissance there was a reintroduction of Latin and Greek words, some of who displaced the previous ones.
* There is a project number of 1000 words of Arabic origin; in this are included words which are also present in most other languages (e.g. ""cotton"" is Arabic,  like ""algodão"").
* Most words beginning with ""al"" are actually *not* Arabic, but Latin. This is especially true for almost all verbs. This one is quite tricky since people have assumed that ""al"" means ""Arabic word"" when it's a common prefix in Latin as well (and generally say that things like ""almoço"" - lunch - and ""além""  - over there - are Arabic when they are in fact Latin)
* Most Portuguese names and surnames have a Germanic origin or an Hebrew/Aramaic origin (via the Bible)
* Several distinguishing sounds are indeed generally related to the influence of Celtic, but to which extent it is had to know
* ""Oxalá"" is a common saying in Portuguese and Spanish, and is of Arabic origin, but it wasn't obtained from Muslims but, like almost all the other words, from the [mozarabs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozarab), which were Christian natives living under Muslim rule and which spoke Arabic or Mozarabic - this included Visigoths, and reminds me what would latter happen in Jerusalem after the Cruzades.
* Germanic vocabulary is mostly related to warfare",0,1364072058,null,0,1364072329,0,c914vu8,t3_1avedj,t1_c914vu8,t1_c914i53,null,1431680693,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

-It has two genders for nouns, one or two cases (depending on who you ask) and no conjugation of verbs depending on the subject, thus making it really easy to learn to read or write.

-It is very hard to talk and understand for foreigners because it is very fast and monotone and without clear indication when words end and begin. Our silly ""singing"" Norwegian neighbours tell us we speak with a potato in our mouths.

Those things don't grew on trees and we have to import the raw materials and the Energy we need in the manufacturing progress for it. And they would become cheaper with a stronger Euro, which basically means the production cost would decrease and we would be able to adjust the prices of our products.

And not only that, a stronger € would also strengthen our internal market, which means the citizens could afford to buy all the nice things we manufacture, simply because we would have more money available (which would be a great thing because it would improve our trade *in*balance).

* It is related to the Central Asian Turkic languages (Uzbek, Turkmen, Kyrgyz, etc.) and to Mongolian. It has lots of loan words from Persian, Arabic, Greek, and French though. 
* It has vowel harmony but no gender, like Finnish (there is even one word for he/she/it).
* It has agglutination like German, so you can make really long words. One of the famous ones is çekoslovakyalılaştıramadıklarımızdanmışsınız, which means, ""you appear to be one of those whom we were unable to turn into a Czechoslovakian.""
* A lot of our verbs are a Persian word with ""etmek"" or ""yapmak"" afterwards (e.g., imza etmek - to sign, kabul etmek - to accept). 
* Other verbs are formed with agglutination off of a root. For example bakabilirim means ""I can see"": ""bak"" see - ""-bil"" able - ""ir"" aorist tense - ""im"" I. 
* The word order is usually subject-object-verb. In really long sentences the subject can be very far away from the verb. However, since there are lots of cases, you can actually be very free with the word order. 
* The negative in verbs is in the middle of the verb, not at the end or beginning (e.g. konuşmadım - I didn't speak v. konuştum - I spoke). 
* There is an inferential tense. 
* There is totally consistent spelling, nothing irregular, I think like in Italian and Finnish. Just so people know: C makes a hard ""J"" sound, and Ğ is silent but lengthens to syllable before it, Ş makes the sh sound in Engish and Ç makes the ch sound (like in cheese).

Remember that if the Cypriot parliament does nothing, then Cyprus collapses; we’re going to need a big show of political unity to prevent that. And so far, the only political unity we’ve seen has been against the bailout, not for it.

Finnish is one of the oldest languages in the world. The Fenno-Ugric language group is very unique in the world and has survived hardly to this century, but many of its languages are dying away. Finnish and Mari, Estonia and Hungary are the most strongest from that tree.

Tolkien was so mesmerized of Finnish that he thought that the Elvs (Elvish) in the LOTR spoke that kinda language.

Here's a good example of the language, the number 10. It is ""Kymmenen"". It actually means ""Kämmenet"" which is ""Hands"". There is five fingers in one hand so two hands...
