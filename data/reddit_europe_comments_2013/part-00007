In France taxes are paying for healthcare, education and infrastructure. Some of the most valuable assets any society can boast about.

Yes, and healthcare, education and infrastructure was already paid for with the former tax rates. What is the 75% rate achieving other than making the wealthy leaving the country, reducing overall tax revenues and increasing the weight of taxation on the middle and lower classes, actually?

&gt;The problem for governments is that they are the ultimate risk takers: no private entity is going to take a massive risk in creating a new industry unless the risk is underwritten by government in various ways.

The problem for governments is that they don't have the same incentives to maximise the benefits and minimise the costs as the taxpayers pay for the difference. They can invest a lot on stupid shit that doesn't pay out because they were pressured to by special interest groups.

There's a reason why in Portugal RTP, the state-owned TV, is an huge burden to the taxpayers whereas SIC and TV, two privately-owned TV stations, offer the same service without needing taxpayer money.

damn you make fine conversation…

&gt; was already paid for with the former tax rates

apparently not, because states across Europe are implementing austerity measures…

&gt; What is the 75% rate achieving

not much. The state will not see much money coming in from there but the perception will be that even the rich are making a contribution thus making it easier to implement belt tightening measures.

&gt; The problem for governments is that they don't have the same incentives to maximise the benefits and minimise the costs

not true. There are inefficient private businesses (some big banks come to mind) that corner a market and keep chugging on. It's up to you and me to pressure public entities to become more transparent and efficient.

One other thing: private enterprise is only interested in profit and will slash anything that gets in the way. Government has a mandate to the people to provide a stable environment in which a healthy society can grow.

&gt; whereas SIC and TV, two privately-owned TV stations, offer the same service without needing taxpayer money

but do they offer programming that is critical of their major stakeholders and advertising sponsors? do they produce programming that has value to the consumer instead of to the advertiser?

I guess you don't care much about these things…

Yes, I know it won't be these draconian laws, but they do have a negative impact on your overall competitiveness, it won't be much of an issue on the next year or so but it will have its toll as time goes by. It always does.

&gt;""France is in free fall"" is an abusive title which, anyway, was referring only to competitivity, not the budget.

They're interconnected, a state with an uncompetitive economy has an harder time balancing its budget, and unfortunately France is further restricting the free market and already needs to increase taxes to balance its budget.

I personally wouldn't care too much if you were some country in Asia or South America but no, you're France, your economy is huge and you're at the heart of Europe, you going down the same road we did a decade ago is no joke, I really don't want to see the European project fail because one after another countries couldn't balance their budgets and had to rely on the support of the rest of the EU.

There's a lot more people leaving the countries in austerity, in case you haven't left the house or turned on the news for a year. As for Depardieu, I'm pretty sure France gives him more in subsidies for his movies than they get out of him.

&gt;And there's also populist politicians that want to pander to the workers by making the whole economy more uncompetitive

I don't know the details in France, but there's also the populist politician who wants to pander to the rich by cutting their taxes. I mean, by that argument, just cut all social benefits and let companies hire and fire at will, even for an hour, and you'll have the most competitive economy in the world. The reality is, security increases productivity as well.

 It's a balance, and it's also a choice of what society you want to live in: China is extremely competitive, yet neo-liberals don't move there. And I wish that was the lowest model they had for Europe, but it's much worse.

&gt;Sure, there is. Though I wonder if you can afford these ""necessary"" investments when your economy is failing and you're just piling on the debt and leaving it for future generations.

*Yawn.* Predictable. And yet, there's no social debt to be paid, countries can just have massive unemployment for years with no long term influence on the economy, crime, health and everywhere else, right?

I did, unlike most people, I had Geography in my 11th grade, we studied extensively CAP and its goals and effects and all that. Even Portugal, a net receiver, lost a lot to CAP as it forced us to downsize production at a time we needed to increase it. And then came all the new plans and environmental concerns and we were fine to produce again if it was biological or we could opt to not produce at all and get paid for it. And this went on for some time, even my own grandparents had a vineyard but they only started cultivating when CAP gave them money and they stopped when CAP paid them to stop. It's just bullshit wasting and telling me ""9 out of 10 people think the EU caring about farming is good"" is retarded, why don't you first tell people how CAP actually is, the actual effects it has, the expense it requires from the taxpayers and then ask them ""know that you know how CAP works, do we need it?""?

Is there any European country with employement-at-will?

The budget argument stemmed from your ""investement in housing argument"". The fact that the deficit is shrinking shows you that it is possible to make necessary investments (the lack of which is probably the biggest way austerity can screw things up) and reduce the deficit by both cutting spendings and increasing taxes (the most lucrative increases being probably the 41%-&gt;45% for the top rate and 19.6%-&gt;20% for the VAT.)

Given the alternative, frankly yes. If you look a bit in the recent French political history, the Socialist party is the only one who has really reformed anything (which is a bit biased, since the only socialist government in recent history was Jospin).

Note also that the socialist party is somewhat more economically liberal than the UMP (never a right-wing minister would have said Jospin ""the State cannot solve everything"").

true,uat2d,PORT,oink,"&gt;There's a lot more people leaving the countries in austerity, in case you haven't left the house or turned on the news for a year.

Not because of austerity but because of the taxes which haven't been cut like the rest of the public spending.

&gt;As for Depardieu, I'm pretty sure France gives him more in subsidies for his movies than they get out of him.

Now there's a good idea, instead of increasing taxes, cutting spending in those subsidies. Really, subsidies in the film industry? How has that waste not been cut already?

&gt;I don't know the details in France, but there's also the populist politician who wants to pander to the rich by cutting their taxes.

Pander to the rich? How does that even work? That politician will get the support of 5% of the electorate at the expense of some 50% who might see that as very unfair?

&gt;I mean, by that argument, just cut all social benefits and let companies hire and fire at will, even for an hour, and you'll have the most competitive economy in the world.

Competitiveness isn't just that, but I have to ask you, why only for an hour? For the most part companies fire and hire at will in the USA and in the UK, and they're better there than for example here where there's massive fees in order to fire someone and there's also all the paperwork required and after some years it's basically impossible to fire people which leads to people not having to work as hard as they don't risk losing their job and overall competitiveness goes down and even if you have a guy straight out of university that's eager to work and will work more for less, that person can be unemployed for long periods of time because companies already have people employed and can't fire them because of out laws even though the people working there are much less productive than the young people looking for a job and so it's no surprise that here it's harder to fire 5 guys than it is to shut down an whole plant and send 150 people straight into unemployment, making them unemployed for life because, well, the other businesses can't fire people and hire new ones even if the people looking for a job are more fit. Good going with all the ""workers rights"" bullshit and the unemployment it creates, learn from the Brits and the Yanks and the Swiss as they don't have any of this shit and everybody is better off and their unemployment rate is much lower.

&gt;The reality is, security increases productivity as well.

How so? I'm still young so I have to be productive, but imagine I was 35, how will security make me more productive?

If anything, it will make me less productive as I know for a fact the company I work in would have to pay dearly to fire me and so even I work half or am paid twice what someone in their 25 years does, I don't have to be productive because the labour laws protect me at the expense of more qualified workers.

&gt;It's a balance, and it's also a choice of what society you want to live in: China is extremely competitive, yet neo-liberals don't move there.

China isn't competitive, China works on slave labour. If you don't allow your workers to go home and place nets to avoid them from killing themselves. Hopefully industrialisation will make this obsolete just like it made Africans or oxen.

&gt;And yet, there's no social debt to be paid, countries can just have massive unemployment for years with no long term influence on the economy, crime, health and everywhere else, right?

No, it's the opposite. But if you're serious about these issues and want to fight unemployment, you'd best lower the spending to be able to afford lowering taxes and help bringing jobs back into our country.

&gt;Sometime in the last century many people died to have social rights, and the economy was better off.

Social rights only exist when you can afford them. If the economy doesn't improve, all the people that died fighting for the social rights will have died in vain, if you want to preserve the social rights, you best stop with the tax burden on it and allow it to grow, it's the only way you'll sustain and preserve those social rights.",0,1357931120,null,0,false,0,c7v6ddd,t3_16d2n6,t1_c7v6ddd,t1_c7v5rkp,null,1430928870,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

I don't know about your politics that much, truth be told, but what I do know is that this diarrhoea of bad policies being implemented in France only came when Hollande took office. I wouldn't be that excited about reforms when they're for the worse.

&gt;Note also that the socialist party is somewhat more economically liberal than the UMP (never a right-wing minister would have said Jospin ""the State cannot solve everything""). But it is true that they are far less pro-capitalism (which is not a contradiction in a European country: less regulation/intervention, but the remaining intervention are aimed at not giving the capital too much power).

More economically liberal? They why are they trying to restrict so much?

Oh, and as for the anti-capitalism, I personally think that's utter nonsense and I think it shows, they could be milking the fat cow that are the wealthy but now they can't as fat cows like Depardieu surprisingly enough don't like being taxes at 75% and are doing everything to avoid paying it at all.

Much to your surprise this is the catholic church's answer: 

&gt; It is necessary to state firmly once more that nothing and no one can in any way permit the killing of an innocent human being, whether a fetus or an embryo, an infant or an adult, an old person, or one suffering from an incurable disease, or a person who is dying. Furthermore, no one is permitted to ask for this act of killing, either for himself or herself or for another person entrusted to his or her care, nor can he or she consent to it, either explicitly or implicitly. Nor can any authority legitimately recommend or permit such an action. For it is a question of the violation of the divine law, an offense against the dignity of the human person, a crime against life, and an attack on humanity.

There are a few differences across regions. For example, auxiliars in Madrid work 16 hours a week (the rest of us are 12-15) and make 1000 euro/month because the cost of living is much higher. The rest of us make 700.

A girl in greece marries another Greek orthodox . . that is how it has been since ancient times . . and if a greek fell in love with a slavic they would be outcasted and forced to move to a different country.

This is the same thing Jews do . . 99% of jewish marriages are between other jewish people and has always been so to protect there heritage.

Even in modern times, inside greece 99.99% of marriages are between a greek woman and man. Very rarely do you see anything different although it does happen recently since greek culture is alot more liberal then it used to be . . but in Ancient times? I cannot even imagine how conservative they must have been considering how conservative they are now . . I am greek i would know this.

Are you smoking ganja or something? [You should try some even better stuff: here](http://static1.fjcdn.com/thumbnails/comments/How+about+a+nice+can+of+science+_57e75420f1fdb6bd1ab327e86225d578.gif)

Since you don't give a fuck about the issue, and you are still picking a side, can you be specific on what grounds you are making the decision on this? Cause it is  similar to how I don't give fuck about Kashmir or the Falklands, but personally, I keep my mouth shut and stay neutral.  So honestly on what kind of information other than ""no fucks given"" have you decided that the Skopjans are right? 

Is it because you are under the impression that you are fighting nationalism? We could all agree on a name like Slavic Macedonia, but they'll start jumping up and down that they are not Slavic. They are not Slavic contrary to DNA evidence, their language is not 95% Bulgaric contrary to what glosologists will tell, they don't give a shit about historians either and claim Ancient Macedonian ancestry, next they'll claim they're also the descendants of lord Xenu and start selling power balance bracelets imbued with gypsy skopjan voodoo.

Or you get all teary eyed cause those poor people have the right to call themselves whatever they want? Well what about the Northern Greeks, fuck them right? What's exactly the fucking difference between skopjans and northern greeks having the right to be known the way they fucking want again? 

I guess Greece should start posing millitary threats as in the Falklands and Kashmir if that's what gets you on. We'll be like rename the place to ""Former Roma Republic of Tito's Impressionable Ultra-Nationalist Bitches"" or else invasion, and then all of a sudden Europe will take it seriously. If it comes to arbitrary bullshit Greece can do that way better than the Skopjans if they wanted to.

I wouldn't block Skopjans being in the EU just because of the name, even more so when they owe nothing to Europeans and we are still being ungrateful debt niggers deep in economical dysfunctional shit, but no matter what good natured and reasonable way I try to approach this, what the Skopjans seem to want is fucking inane, and fucking insults logic. 



""Nothing that I've said comes even close to Greece petulantly blocking Macedonian accession to the EU over a reason so inane that any writer would deem it too ridiculous to put to pen were it not the sad reality. ""

Are you delusional or something? I can find fifteen dozen multiple phd in history people at pretty fucking prestigious universities worldwide, that would easily agree that Skopja is conducting mass scale historical manipulation with mainly nationalist motives. Are you sure you are not the one who's ridiculous here vs 99% of the people studying history?

It still isn't a reason to block Skopja, but your whole point that ""Greeks have no right to complain cause they are not as bright as Ancient Greeks"" is nonsensical. History should always be a scientifical field and not [something to be written by whoever gets to succeed](http://qph.cf.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a7b22a0d696cfb7b355711e1460f9f08). I am not *clinging to the past blah blah blah* fucking bullshit, I just don't want them called that way it's baseless and freaking stupid, plus I call myself Macedonian, I AM Macedonian, and if they want to call themselves Macedonian, then they'll first have to sit on my big, fat, Macedonian dick. Alexander himself declared to be Greek, how can Skopjans claim to be Macedonian but NOT Greek, that's like just pure mathematics and common sense, [are you dumb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Chronology_(Fomenko\) ) can you even like recite the multiplication table, do you even lift bro???

I'm sorry I have history experts suggesting Skopja is manipulating history, and me and the historians are being inane, while Skopjans and their 50s Cold War propaganda are being sensible? Come again? ... My amigo... You should check

true,Perky_Goth,PORT,Portugal,"&gt;Not because of austerity but because of the taxes which haven't been cut like the rest of the public spending.

That is austerity. And more will continue to leave if taxes ever lower because you'll be fucked if something bad ever happens to you.

&gt;Now there's a good idea, instead of increasing taxes, cutting spending in those subsidies. Really, subsidies in the film industry? How has that waste not been cut already?

Because culture, like transportation, health, education, social security, police, army, fireman and so on have a value of their own which can't be measured by ROIs. As an example in the corporate world, no one can put a real ROI on their investment in social media, but every company knows it must do something.

&gt;Pander to the rich? How does that even work? 

I have no idea. People like you believe managers, economists, bank owners and so on are enlightened demigods who are well above the common pleb and should not follow the same rules and ideals, not unlike feudalistic systems, maybe because they feel that if they work hard enough, they'll belong there. It'll take a few more centuries for people to see each other as equals and see honest work as a very valuable thing.

&gt; there's massive fees in order to fire someone and there's also all the paperwork required and after some years it's basically impossible to fire people

The OECD debunked that it was hard to fire in this country years ago, but oh well... You offer no solution either, you just say we should replace older workers *who will not find another job* with younger ones who have less responsibilities and no families to take care of and thus can work very long hours for little pay, completely bypassing the fact that this will massively lower wages and work conditions while also lowering the birth rate. If I knew you IRL I'd bet real money that that is going to inevitably happen in the short term, because it's basically the whole IMF modus operandi (except the birth rate, that's just reality).

There's to ways to deal with employment without creating scores of unemployable people, either you give protection to their jobs as long as they work well, or you support them and create opportunities for when then get laid off. The IMF supports simply not caring about them regardless of how productive they could still be. I have no idea how that's remotely comparable to the US and the UK.

&gt;How so? I'm still young so I have to be productive, but imagine I was 35, how will security make me more productive?

How will fearing for your paycheck every day or fearing getting sick help you to be creative and open minded? Studies show it makes you a worse employer because you're much less focused on what you're doing and more stressed, and instead thinking whether you're going to please the boss or not. It works somewhat better for repetitive jobs like factory workers, I guess. 

And I don't mean I want people to be unfirable, in case that isn't obvious.

&gt; I don't have to be productive because the labour laws protect me at the expense of more qualified workers.
Yeah, everyone I know wants to be a drag on society... you should change friends if that's your experience. 

You can point out many ways in which *some* state employees had somewhat exaggerated rights *ten years ago*, but that never stopped private companies from finding ways of firing at will. Seriously, just restructure the company and end the necessity of their post, or close the company and open another one down the street while transferring assets.

While you can also find many other people who live of entitlements with no intention of ever working a day in their lives, there's also people who really have extremely debilitating diseases or are unemployed for so long that they are completely unemployable, but I find that no reason for them to have to choose whether to live a life of begging or to die of hunger because, honestly, the opportunists still amounts to peanuts compared to a BPN or a few worthless dams. 

&gt;China isn't competitive, China works on slave labour. 

You say that, and yet all neo-liberals promote is getting us closer and closer to their work conditions, with no point where we should stop. Huge dissonance there. Possible mandatory overtime with little pay, lots of possible reasons for firing, barely livable paychecks, minimal and expensive healthcare (at least 5% of a minimum wage to have a pap smear, ffs), overcrowded schools with overworked teachers, expensive options to address legal issues, puny pensions, minimal public transportation...

Seriously, it's about what society you want to live in, one where you can be content with what you have, or one where only those who have the strength and will to do anything to ascend can fit in.

&gt;If you don't allow your workers to go home and place nets to avoid them from killing themselves. 
Much as I dislike it, it has been disproved. Suicide rates are not that much worse per capita, if at all. Many of them work overtime willingly to have more money, just like neo-liberals say society should work.

&gt; No, it's the opposite. But if you're serious about these issues and want to fight unemployment, you'd best lower the spending to be able to afford lowering taxes and help bringing jobs back into our country.

I'm all for it. When are we going to stop paying rent for essential monopolistic services that are increasing quickly in price and giving away profitable (or that would be without either political shenanigans or if they wouldn't have to provide for intangible services) public companies? Or audit and renegotiate the unpayable debt? Why are we still paying more to private schools? Why are we paying ridiculous amounts for a km of highway?

What I am not willing to support, because I'm a human being, is throwing people on the streets because they lost their job or got sick and can't afford to be cured, or to completely destroy the quality of the public schools and transportation. Guess what, 50% of people are below average and I find they still deserve to not live in squaller fearing for their job no matter how much they work.

&gt;Social rights only exist when you can afford them. If the economy doesn't improve, all the people that died fighting for the social rights will have died in vain

They died in vain because their successors took it all for granted and will only fight again when they get all taken away again. There will be very minor social rights 10 years from now to protect, so I don't know which ones you think we'll maintain.

I'm not much of an economic student, but most people who are are full of shit and treat whatever theories they read as provable science, so I'll say this: the economy grew in a much more stable way when social rights appeared. Now they're all being taken away to support a boom and bust economy where the 1% takes the profits and everyone else pays the bill. There's no end to this, they aren't content, and governments aren't fining them enough or putting people in jail, so there's no real incentive to not abuse ponzi schemes.

I live in Galicia, and the cost of living is very low. I always eat at home, I NEVER eat out, unless I'm traveling. I try to spend as little as possible per week. Also, almost everyone in this program does private English lessons on the side. They are in VERY high demand. I teach 5 lessons per week, sometimes 6 or 7, and I charge 10 euro per hour (a lot of people charge more, like 12-15, some people even somehow get 20/hour). So by the end of the week, I make at least an extra 50 euro. By the end of the month I make about 900-950 euro altogether. 


Rent in my area is very low, between 120-200 euro for your own room in an apartment. I also am paying back student loans, and I manage to travel around or out of the country at least once a month. 700 euro doesn't sound like a lot of money, but I manage to pay all of my bills and travel and still have a bit left over. You just have to budget your money and probably live a little more frugally than you do at home.


Also, just for some perspective, so far within Spain I've been to Galicia, Madrid, and Valencia, and it is very possible to get a glass of (good) wine for under 2 euro and they bring you pinchos (a piece of bread usually with some kind of topping) for free with your drink. This is very common throughout Spain. You can almost always find a bar or two that has shots for a euro, or a beer for the same price. Going out here is very cheap. I like to go out frequently, and since it's so cheap, it really doesn't even seem like I'm cutting into my budget.

I think verlan cannot evolve forever.

As far as a social life goes, I live in a medium (on the smaller side) city and there are a lot of Americans who live here as well. I joined the facebook group for this program (there is one already going for th 2013-14 school year, I'll PM it to you) and the people who were going to live in the same city as me friended me and we talked a little bit before we arrived. I moved into an apartment with one of them, with another American across the hall. I also live with two Spanish girls and getting to know their friends is really fun as well.


Another great resource to use to build a new social life is to get involved with the Erasmus community in your area. If you want to be in Madrid, they will absolutely have one. Erasmus is the name of the international exchange programs for university students here in Europe. In my small city, there are people here from France, England, Portugal,  Germany, Italy, Romania, and probably more. They always have activities together and they always post their bar events and other activities on facebook for anyone to join. They are really helpful-- they will help you get settled to an apartment if you need help and they are very welcoming. I went out with them to a few bars at the beginning and we all went horseback riding together one weekend in a nearby village. I'm decent friends with a few of them and we usually see each other out on weekends. 


Almost everyone who's coming to this program comes alone. You definitely won't be the only one without friends, and as much as I hate to say it, Facebook is a really good resource. It's how I met my closest friend here as well as our casual acquaintances around town. When I got here, I slept for a few hours in my hotel the first night and I went out that night with Erasmus and immediately made one friend, and she really helped me get comfortable here and offered to help me find an apartment. The next day I met the American girl who I'm really close to, and soon after I met my roommates. The first few days are the hardest,  but you'll find that you'll make fast (and good) friends. Everyone doing this program has a story of why they came and all that, and they'll want to share it with you. I hope that helps. Feel free to ask any more questions, I've been here for about 4 months now and it's the best decision I ever made.",0,1357990800,null,0,false,0,c7vkemj,t3_16dlii,t1_c7vkemj,t1_c7vk6bg,null,1430936044,1,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,1

It's a very beautiful place. The town is nestled between huge mountainous hills, with the river running through the middle and the ocean about twenty minutes away. The central part of Bilbao is all very very compact and close together and walkable. There is abundant public transportation - metro, tram, funiculars, buses, and you can walk everywhere. You can take a twenty minute metro ride out to the beach towns. 

The food is good, lots of pinxos. Alcohol is expensive, but seems to be able the same as the rest of Spain. I haven't found that many good places to go out yet - if you're into metal there seem to be a ton a bars with very very angry music happening and tons of people inside. 

There are a lot of beautiful parks and plazas, tons of places for shopping if that's your thing, and a lot of museums. I've only been to the guggenheim so far but there's also a fines arts museum and a museum of basque culture. 

It is a pretty small town but it feels bigger than I expected. I'd read before I got here that the population was about 300,000. The entire metro area actually comes to about a million and there are always people out in the streets and the city feels very alive.

I don't know if any of this is remotely useful. I think it looks like a very beautiful and fun place to spend the next couple months.

&gt;That is austerity. And more will continue to leave if taxes ever lower because you'll be fucked if something bad ever happens to you.

No, austerity is not that, austerity is cutting excessive public spending, look it up. And no, taxes do need to come down and they're being used by the government wastefully, let me keep my money and I'll take great care of it, certainly much better than the guys in the AR. And no, I don't need the government to act as insurance against my will, instead of them taxing me and giving it back in case they think I need it, let me keep my money and I'll use it myself if the need occurs.

Unlike what you might think, there's no free lunches, for the government to provide if first needs to take away. I say we cut the middle man for a lot of shit as clearly it isn't doing its job right. If people get to pay less taxes they'll also be less dependent on the government.

&gt;Because culture, like transportation, health, education, social security, police, army, fireman and so on have a value of their own which can't be measured by ROIs. As an example in the corporate world, no one can put a real ROI on their investment in social media, but every company knows it must do something.

Health and education and safety and justice, you're right on those, if we get careless on those, the whole economy benefits from those. But culture and that shit, no way, Hollywood and all of that is achieved without any public investment, let people keep their money as that's what's necessary, if the people then want culture, let them pursuit it on their own, let's not subsidise a tv station like RTP2 which then nobody watches anyway even though it's all paid for by the taxpayers.

[Please read Bastiat on this](http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html#theatres_fine_arts).

&gt;I have no idea. People like you believe managers, economists, bank owners and so on are enlightened demigods who are well above the common pleb and should not follow the same rules and ideals, not unlike feudalistic systems, maybe because they feel that if they work hard enough, they'll belong there. It'll take a few more centuries for people to see each other as equals and see honest work as a very valuable thing.

What the fuck are you talking about? I'm just saying that the state shouldn't restrict the free market like it has been doing for ages, anyone could be a manager or a business owner if the state didn't have to make things so difficult with all the bureaucracy and taxes and regulation and laws and waiting periods, we're only missing out a lot on this whereas other countries have their economy much better and their unemployment much lower just because they don't restrict their economy like that and don't get into massive debts while pandering to everyone with public works that everybody now wants to get rid of because of how wasteful it all was and nobody is happy now that they have to pay for it.

&gt;The OECD debunked that it was hard to fire in this country years ago, but oh well...

They must have confused Portugal for Peru or something like that then, the fees you must pay to fire someone are massive and it's no wonder our unemployment is so high now given that there's such a restriction to employment.

&gt;You offer no solution either, you just say we should replace older workers who will not find another job with younger ones who have less responsibilities and no families to take care of and thus can work very long hours for little pay, completely bypassing the fact that this will massively lower wages and work conditions while also lowering the birth rate. If I knew you IRL I'd bet real money that that is going to inevitably happen in the short term, because it's basically the whole IMF modus operandi (except the birth rate, that's just reality).

I did give you the solution, liberalise the labour market and let everybody hire and fire at will. While we're at it, slash the bureaucracy required to create companies. That way, businesses will be free to hire whomever they want as even if that person ends up being a burden to the company, it can then be fired and not drag the business down and also people that do end up unemployed will also have a much easier time creating their own employment as opposed to sitting around waiting for someone to employ them.

&gt;There's to ways to deal with employment without creating scores of unemployable people, either you give protection to their jobs as long as they work well, or you support them and create opportunities for when then get laid off. The IMF supports simply not caring about them regardless of how productive they could still be. I have no idea how that's remotely comparable to the US and the UK.

In the US or the UK people can fire you almost on the spot, not so much here where the whole notion is taboo and so companies sink much more slowly because they simply can't compete and in the end it's everybody that has to pay for the lack of productivity of some workers, which is not fair at all.

btw, there's no reason to give them protection while they have their jobs as long as they work well as if that's the case, it's already in the best interest of the business that that worker is well taken care off otherwise he might go work for the competition. What you're suggesting would require yet another burden on the ever decreasing number of taxpayers which on its own promotes even more unemployment.

&gt;How will fearing for your paycheck every day or fearing getting sick help you to be creative and open minded?

If you're productive, you have nothing to fear, you'll only benefit from this. If you're not productive, then I'd worry because you can get fired and that's how it should be, it should never be everyone paying for one's lack of productivity.

&gt;Studies show it makes you a worse employer because you're much less focused on what you're doing and more stressed, and instead thinking whether you're going to please the boss or not. It works somewhat better for repetitive jobs like factory workers, I guess. 

What about it? Is trying to show to your boss how much of a great worker you are a bad thing?

Oh, and please stop looking at it always from the employee side, what about the employer which might have to close the plant in 6 months time because there's 5 workers not doing their job properly and he can't fire them and now there's more people slacking off as they've started to notice that workers that don't bother as much aren't penalised?

&gt;You can point out many ways in which some state employees had somewhat exaggerated rights ten years ago, but that never stopped private companies from finding ways of firing at will. Seriously, just restructure the company and end the necessity of their post, or close the company and open another one down the street while transferring assets.

Which is still too much of an hassle and that's also costly which leads to that company being less productive and competitive. It should be much simpler to hire and fire and also to start a business.

&gt;While you can also find many other people who live of entitlements with no intention of ever working a day in their lives, there's also people who really have extremely debilitating diseases or are unemployed for so long that they are completely unemployable, but I find that no reason for them to have to choose whether to live a life of begging or to die of hunger because, honestly, the opportunists still amounts to peanuts compared to a BPN or a few worthless dams. 

People with extremely debilitating diseases shouldn't be a burden on companies, at most they should be at the care of social security or the NHS. If you want to take care of those, great, so do I, but let's not put the burden on people that want to get a job done, that way what you're promoting is unemployment for the rest of the guys in that company as if it's not beneficial for a company to hire someone with such a disability, then that's money they won't have to spend in hiring some other worker like a guy straight out of college or someone from some other company which closed down and this worker has valuable knowledge in the business.

As for the unemployable, that's a problem for the education system and social care, again, not for companies, if you shove them off into working businesses and then wonder why those working businesses suddenly don't work so well, then you're doing something wrong. You want to give these people benefits and invest on their education, fine, but do that while minimising their costs for companies that do want to get work done.

As for their weight compared to BPN or damns, they're still very heavy, don't neglect the weight that can have on an economy, the unemployment you're facing is because of these factors. Though you're right, the state bailing out BPN was a massive mistake (it should have been better regulated to prevent what happened from ever happening) and all the dams we built are nowadays still a great expense for all of society.

&gt;You say that, and yet all neo-liberals promote is getting us closer and closer to their work conditions, with no point where we should stop. Huge dissonance there. Possible mandatory overtime with little pay, lots of possible reasons for firing, barely livable paychecks, minimal and expensive healthcare (at least 5% of a minimum wage to have a pap smear, ffs), overcrowded schools with overworked teachers, expensive options to address legal issues, puny pensions, minimal public transportation...

No, it's nothing like that, if anything these measures would turn us more into the UK or Switzerland. The mandatory overtime with little pay would end the moment unemployment went down (which would happen if it was more profitable and more easy to employ here), the low pay checks we already have and these would only go up with a reduction in unemployment as companies would lose much of their bargaining position, the minimum wage should be reformed so that its value wasn't decided by the state but rather by the worker, the employer and the labour union (just like it happens in countries like Austria, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Finland - all countries in a much better situation than us), public schools do need reform, the justice system as well, pensions should be managed much better as the current system isn't sustainable for not even 10 years and public transportation should be privatised as we already spend loads of money on it and the private sector provides the same service much more efficiently, not to mention we already spent massive amount of money on the roads.

&gt;When are we going to stop paying rent for essential monopolistic services that are increasing quickly in price and giving away profitable (or that would be without either political shenanigans or if they wouldn't have to provide for intangible services) public companies?

The moment the state leaves that business and the companies are left on their own and without taxpayer funding having to compete with the rest of us mortals by the same rules.

&gt;Or audit and renegotiate the unpayable debt?

I don't know, though we must also not follow Greece into that path of defaulting, Socrates made the deals, now Coelho is paying for it and he can't force Socrates to cough up the money. Yes, it's bullshit.

&gt;Why are we still paying more to private schools?

Because our public schools not always can provide the same service. I did my high school on a private one and it was the state that paid for it because my area of study wasn't available in the eb2/3 I was in, and I should tell you, it was a school much better managed than all the public ones I was in.

&gt;Why are we paying ridiculous amounts for a km of highway?

Because our state is corrupted. Not that we need those highways anyway, in the EU, only Luxembourg has more roads per square kilometre than us.

&gt;What I am not willing to support, because I'm a human being, is throwing people on the streets because they lost their job or got sick and can't afford to be cured, or to completely destroy the quality of the public schools and transportation. Guess what, 50% of people are below average and I find they still deserve to not live in squaller fearing for their job no matter how much they work.

I also don't support that. Though I also don't support a nanny-state where more and more people abuse the system and less and less people are working to pay for it, that's not sustainable at all, if you give benefits to it you must first do everything to prevent people from abusing the system, you have to control the beneficiaries and you must be able to pay for it without creating a great burden on the rest of society - if these guarantees are made, we'll be able to preserve our welfare state, if wise-asses that continue to game the system go unchecked, it's definitely going to fail.

&gt;They died in vain because their successors took it all for granted and will only fight again when they get all taken away again. There will be very minor social rights 10 years from now to protect, so I don't know which ones you think we'll maintain.

More the reason for us to improve our economy so that we can live with dignity again, let's look at the cases of success such as the UK, Switzerland, Finland or Austria, let's do our utmost to improve business conditions as opposed to restrict them, let's actively work to promote employment instead of adding expenses to possible employers, let's create an environment where businesses can succeed and not where the businesses we do have are forced to leave or move some place else, let's not go down the same path of the cases of failure such as Greece, Venezuela, Argentina, the former GDR or other countries in the Eastern Bloc as it couldn't be clearer that for us to live with dignity we must first allow businesses to flourish and not the other way around.

&gt;the economy grew in a much more stable way when social rights appeared. 

False, our economy grew when we joined the EU and the restrictions to competition from the Estado Novo were lifted, not to mention that we stopped squandering money in Africa and instead got money from Europe to squander on ourselves.

&gt;Now they're all being taken away to support a boom and bust economy where the 1% takes the profits and everyone else pays the bill.

Take your socialist rhetoric elsewhere, there's no 1% taking all the profits, in Portugal what you do have is an environment that kills the competitiveness of any business and inept governments and corrupt politicians that either offer special favours to interest groups or act against the private sector to pander to the masses - what we need to do is liberalise the market and remove the barriers to competition, so that anyone can own a business and this stupid ""oh, the evil companies"" bullshit dies down, for this to happen there also needs to be an environment where there's a reduced tax burden and reduced public spending, let people keep their money and let them spend it on their own, it's the only way that the economy can flourish, it's if people are free to start a business and if it's them the ones that get to keep their wage as opposed to the government restricting the entry of new agents in the market and taxes people and is the one who decides what it should buy with our money (like the PPPs or the state-owned companies which are an immense amount of pain and waste to our country).

&gt;There's no end to this, they aren't content, and governments aren't fining them enough or putting people in jail, so there's no real incentive to not abuse ponzi schemes. No one is pointing out where the theft of rights will stop for a reason.

Bilbao is like a small Barcelona to say the least. Mountains, beaches, bars, clubs, shops, museums, cathedrals, etc. We have the 5th largest metropolitan area in spain. Bilbao is very densely populated (the neighboring town of Santutxu is the most densely populated area in all of Europe!) 
Like Barcelona and Catalan, Bilbao is part of Pais Vasco, the Basque Country. Be in for a cultural shock. They are not spaniards here, they are basques (although 90% of the language used is spanish). Get ready to learn a little basque.
People here are super nice. The food is awesome and i love the beaches you can get to by the metro (Sopelana, Barrika, Plentzia). Also check out Las Arenas, and Romo, towns closer to the coast that have great bar scenes and Americans to find occasionally. The metro is the cleanest i've ever been on, and has won many awards for its design and quality.
There is always stuff going on in Bilbao, concerts at Bilborock, Alhondiga, and sometimes outdoor music in the Arenal. Also every Sat and sunday mornings in the Plaza Nueva (part of Casco Viejo) there are flea markets and tons of pintxos (tapas in basque). The Arriaga opera house is one of the most beautiful in the world. I would say fuck the Guggenheim, its overrated and more beautiful from the outside.

Take a plane to Athens and check out the Acropolis and Museum for a full day, take pictures etc. A full day from 8 AM to 8 PM at acropolis will get you the full experience.

AFter that take a quick flight to one of the many islands. Each island has its own unique personality so choose which one fits you the best.

Santoroini - ROmantic paradise, honeymoon capital of Europe and very laid back friendly villagers . . Seeing a mountain up in the middle of nowwhere in Romania is fun but can you seriously beat a Volcano? 

Mykonos - Party island on one side and extremely slow paced villages on the other. GOod mix of party and beign able to just relax in a peaceful setting.

Rhodes - Old city in the capital is a 1,000 year old castle city built by the Knights Templars. Massive castle city still in perfect condition, some of the best clubs and bar streets in Greece are in there . . get crazy at night and during daytime, really fun to walk and take pictures. Also has countless other things to do like kitesurfing, waterpark, ancient ruins,perfect beaches.

There are tiny tiny islands like Halki which only has 150 residents and no cars, its fun to go there to exprience a completely different world and relax.

Best part going from island to island is easy and fast by plane. most flights are like 30-40 minutes. Or you can take a boat ride.

    * Sinistra Ecologia Libertà (Left Ecology Freedom): leftist party led by Puglia's Governor Nichi Vendola, currently not in parliament, worth around 5%.

    * Centro Democratico (Democratic Centre): Recently formed Centre party led by a former member of PD and a former member of the crumbling IDV party.
* Centre Right: Yet to be named supposedly Centre-Right coalition led by Berlusconi.
    * Popolo della Libertà (Peopole of Freedom): Berlusconi's Party
    * Lega Nord (Northern League): on-off Berlusconi allies, Northern Italy indipendentists, arguably xenophobic.
    * Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy): part of Berlusconi's party which seceded from PdL (maybe)
    * La Destra (The Right): right party led by former LAzio region's governor Storace (maybe)
* Con Monti Per L'Italia (With Monti for Italy): Monti's centrist Coalition
    * Monti's List: Monti-picked people from Italy's industry leaders and other prominent figures
    * Unione di Centro (Centre Union): centrist party which has always supported Monti.
    * Futuro e Libertà Per L'Italia (Future and Freedom for Italy): party that seceded from Berlusconi's party last year, contributing to his demise. Led by a former neo-fascist who is now sometimes more progressive than Italy's centre-left. Worth around 2% according to polls.
* Movimento 5 Stelle (5 Star Movement): Internet-aware protest movement (but they probably don't like to be called that) led by former comedian Beppe Grillo
* Rivoluzione Civile (Civil Revolution): led by magistrate Antonio Ingroia, apparently uniting pieces of the crumbling IDV party, the small Green Party and Italy's many communist parties.

It is, and that case isn't being made, when it should be.  That isn't to say that there isn't need for reform within the EU nor does it mean that the UK shouldn't be presenting what it sees as the right direction for the EU and working to achieve as much of that as possible.  

&gt;You are too dependent on the financial sector, and everything associated with it. Work your factories, work your land.

This however is a little absurd.  The UK does depend overly on its financial sector (and that does need to change) but it also needs to retain its competitiveness there, what is right for the Eurozone isn't necessarily what is right for the UK (and joining the Euro or even facing the same regulations as Eurozone countries in regard to fiscal or monetary policy is not in the interests of the UK..).  

The UK does produce goods and work its farms etc, it exports too and it's trade balance is getting better, rather than worse.. However the financial services that the UK provides to the world does represent a significant chunk of GDP (around 9% now) but then in Germany it represents more than 6%..  More to the point, the split between Industry  and the service sector broadly is fairly similar between the UK and Germany, 71% services in Germany and 77 in the UK..

&gt;Don't fight imaginary enemies, this is our neighbourhood, we are in this together.

We are all facing different problems and don't all have the same outlook on where we want to go.  That isn't a bad thing.

Rispetto ad un mese fa le novità sono sostanzialmente due: l'indebolimento di Monti e il recupero di Berlusconi.

* Indebolimento di Monti. L'idea che, al di là delle fumisterie sulla salita in politica, l'operazione di Monti abbia più del giochetto tatticista e partitocratico che della grande rifondazione della vita pubblica italiana inizia a passare e ad avere un riflesso nei sondaggi. Questo è dovuto a due fattori: a) trattare con la gente del calibro di Casini e Fini si è rivelato assai più logorante di quanto Monti credesse. La trattativa è stata lunga e complessa e che per settimane l'alto e nobile progetto di Monti si sia tradotto (davanti agli occhi del mondo) in estenuanti trattative da suk magrebino sui posti in lista per il Senato in Calabria ha pesato sull'elettorato; b) l'operazione che Monti aveva in testa (prendere i voti di Berlusconi facendo a meno di Berlusconi) non sta funzionando, perché i voti di apparato del Pdl sono rimasti dov'erano (tradotto: a parte Mario Mauro che un po' di voti ciellini in Lombardia ce li ha nessun cosiddetto portatore d'acqua ha mollato Berlusconi per passare con Monti) e perché quelli di opinione ancora nicchiano

* Recupero di Berlusconi. Come prevedibile, l'uomo in campagna elettorale funziona. L'operazione Santoro è l'emblema perfetto di questo, ed è prevedibile che altro seguirà. A questo punto l'obiettivo di Berlusconi diventa uno: retrocedere Monti e il centro nella serie B dei partitini medio-piccoli e far passare il concetto che gli unici attori politici degni di questo nome sono lui e Bersani. All'apparenza la faccenda è anche nobile (passa il concetto della strenua difesa dell'impianto bipolarista contro il ritorno alla palude della prima repubblica), ma la verità è che la cosa a Berlusconi serve come clausola di sopravvivenza per non essere tagliato fuori dall'accordo postelettorale tra Pd e Monti: l'unico modo che Berlusconi ha per provare a non farsi cinque anni all'opposizione è di fare arrivare in Parlamento un Monti con numeri tanto piccoli da rendere le sue grosse pretese (l'uomo ha già fatto capire chiaramente che per meno di Palazzo Chigi lui nemmeno risponde al telefono) indigeribili. A quel punto Berlusconi, che numeri più grossi (e per questo rassicuranti) di Monti li avrà di sicuro si presenta col sorrisone e dice caro Bersani, vuoi vedere che se io e te ci mettiamo a discutere il prezzo che ti faccio io è dieci volte meglio di quello che ti fa Monti? (Le prove generali di questo abboccamento stanno uscendo in questi giorni mediante aperture di Berlusconi al Pd su gay, riforme, accordi postelettorali eccetera)

Beware of too good deals. 

The problem in Paris is that most appartments are managed by agencies. Hence you have to pass though them to rent. It's safer, but more expensive.

With agencies, most of the time, you have to pay the equivalent of a month's rent to them for their services. Then, you have to pay your first month of rent to the landlord/owner, and also a ""caution"" which represent another month of rent.

So, the best thing is to try to find a landlord/owner that rent directly, harder, but less expensive.

There is also a government help (I think it's the city of Paris that pays that) that can help people arriving in France by paying another kind of agency that does the work of looking for an appartment for you.

[Basil Fawlty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Fawlty) has more chances in running [the new Shangri-La hotel at the Shard](http://www.shangri-la.com/london/shangrila/pre-opening/).

Golden Dawn and some other parties got their protest vote; most of their voters wanted to punish ""the establishment's"" inability to deal with pressing issues (illegal immigration being one of them). They're performing in their show right now, and they'll be back to obscurity in a few years' time, when the state's wrinkles are ironed out. Golden Dawn is part of the system: they just do the the dirty work. Most of their MPs are bourgeois in every sense of the word, don't believe the hype. Their most extreme wing is comprised of a handful of people running around with some youngsters and causing some damage, but they're not capable of doing this in the long run. They know it.

I understand that most people abroad don't have the ability to follow Golden Dawn's case closely, and see how their tone changed after the elections. Most foreign correspondents reproduce stories some Greek leftist journalists are feeding to them. These people conveniently forget to feed them stories about the long term damage the ""anti-establishment"" groups were/are doing, because these groups are associated with the parties these journalists support. Some people disagree with the theory of ""two extremes"" (far-left &amp; far-right), but in reality they're doing the same work (although the far-left is hipper, having a better PR department).

* [Monday December 17, 2012](http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_17/12/2012_474876) - Businessman Lavrentis Lavrentiadis, who owned a controlling stake in Proton Bank, was remanded in custody at Korydallos Prison in Athens on Monday as details of the case file against him showed he is being accused of being part of an “organized team” that knowingly plundered the lender’s funds to finance the entrepreneur’s companies.

true,Heiminator,null,null,"Basically, Offenbach and Frankfurt were both supposed to be founding clubs of the german football league, but then the league decided that only one club from that area was allowed to join instantly, so that there was room left for other teams from other cities. Frankfurt was chosen. This pisses off Offenbach to this day, as they never recovered from that setback. 

Add to that the traditional rivalry that usually occurs between neighboring cities, and the fact that Frankfurt is really rich while Offenbach is quite poor, and you have one of the fiercest rivalries in all of football. Both clubs are also known as troublemakers in german football, Frankfurt especially has one of the fiercest, most violent Ultra scenes in Germany, to the point that Frankfurt games are almost always classified as high-risk games, which means lots more police and security around the stadium.

This is serious business around here, when the two clubs meet in the league cup, which happens once every few years, it turns the entire region into a frenzy. Radio stations broadcast ""peace summits"", where they try to remind people not to burn down the entire stadion on match day for weeks in advance. The last time they played the Derby, they played it in the smaller Offenbach stadium. They had to send over 2000 policemen to keep the 5000 Frankfurt fans in line, and the second Frankfurt scored the first goal the entire block erupted in Fireworks.

A friend of mine from Frankfurt married a girl from Offenbach and got her pregnant two years ago. He made it really clear that his first child would be born in Frankfurt, not Offenbach, no matter what. His wife started to be in labour on the Offenbach side of the River Main, which separates the two cities. He put his wife in the car, ignored the first hospital on his way because it was still on the Offenbach side, crossed the river and drove her to the first hospital on the Frankfurt side. That's how fierce this rivalry is around here :-)

Oh, and to add to the ""Ten faggots and a nigger"" thing, it's a reference to the fact that Offenbach was the first german club to have a non-white player in the professional leagues.

true,krattr,null,null,"I'm the first one to criticize the incompetence of *some* Greek politicians, but there are many issues here.

First, it's not illegal to hold bank accounts in Switzerland, Germany, or any other country. In fact, many Greeks transferred their life savings to these countries, because they were afraid of a change of currency. Some of them even sold land or houses, as prices were plummeting, hoping to use the money in an economy they perceive(d) as more stable. That's why you'll see deposits with large amounts of money, even from ""ordinary"" people. (For what it's worth, a change of currency was out of the question for me, from the beginning of the crisis.)

Second, the list was not obtained using legal means. Germany and other EU countries face(d) similar challenges. For example, the 2008 Liechtenstein tax affair is not completely over yet, investigations are ongoing.

Time for some backstory.

The Lagarde List was given to the Greek authorities in 2010. Papaconstantinou, a former Finance Minister, decided that a court would not accept a file on that CD as proof for any wrongdoing, and asked his colleagues to check if the tax office could find anything shady about the 20 biggest depositors in this list. Venizelos, which took over from Papaconstantinou, says that he didn't find any CD.

Here's where we enter the realm of party politics, because: a) Papaconstantinou did not name the person that he gave the original CD, b) Venizelos retained a copy of the ""list"" on a USB stick AFTER leaving his post in the Ministry, c) Papaconstantinou is associated with Papandreou, the former PM, d) Venizelos regularly leaves hints that Papandreou's side undermines his leadership (he succeeded Papandreou as PASOK leader), and e) there are claims that Papaconstantinou removed the names of 3 of his relatives from this list (which would be stupid, if he wanted to hide anything he would not hold a flashing sign saying ""hey everybody, I'm removing ONLY my relatives"").

On the other side of the fence, Laliotis, which was widely regarded as the person doing the dirty work for PASOK, is said to be working with PASOK's faction that left for SYRIZA, a small leftist party that got much bigger after the recent elections and is contesting PASOK's dominance in the centre-left side of the political spectrum. Laliotis does not get along with Venizelos. SYRIZA took the leadership of the Opposition in the Parliament, and following some unfortunate statements from its MPs, the Lagarde List issue is its raison d'être. TV stations love this, it's a Pakula-worthy mystery and TV zombies love a good gossip.

In reality, even if you tax all the people found in the list, with the highest amount of tax for deposits, whether they evaded tax or not, the state coffers would not feel any significant weight.

If you like old architecture better to go to Cracow, Toruń, Malbork, Lublin, Gdańsk, Zamość, maybe Wrocław. If you like nature - see mountains (Bieszczady, Beskidy, Karkonosze, Pieniny, Tatry), Mazury lakeland, Białowieża primordial forest, Baltic seaside. Polesie is also great.

Warsaw is business city, not touristic city.

Also Warsaw will be the most expansive in Poland, followed by seaside, Tatry mountains and Cracow. It will be still much cheaper than western Europe (or even Prague, for that matter), but in these less known cities prices are adjusted for Poles, so everything is 1.5 - 3 times less expansive. I mean 44 cm pizza in restaurant is 4-8 euro, and beer in pub is 1-1.5 euro in places outside the most famous.

And if you can travel outside EU go to Ukraine to see L'viv city. It's magical. Even better than Cracow and Prague I think. And prices are ridicoulously cheap. Like half of these in Poland.

Now of course, not all this is the fault of or has been engineered by the Germans.

But that old one, ""Never let a decent crisis go to waste,"" has been so well played by the Germans and how ....

So it looks like the choice for the Brits is whether to stay in and get stuffed or withdraw and suffer before making the inevitable comeback.

I think we should also be informed by Bonaparte's Continental System.

Obviously, I am not suggesting that an attempt to exclude the UK from European markets would lead to fisticuffs but that it would be unworkable; like the continental system.

Even most people in Poland never been to Lublin (and everybody have been in Cracow). Last year we've finally built airport, so it's not a problem any longer.

Lublin has pretty and unique Old Town (original buildings, not rebuilt decorations like Warsaw), and people actually live in its Old Town (unlike Cracow, where every tenament house in centrum was turned into tourist attraction). It has unique architecture style (called Lublin renneisance) very different from western Poland. I think only Cracow and Toruń in Poland have better Old Towns (Toruń is another underestimated city in Poland when it comes to architecture - its medieval Old Town is stunning). Cracow is great, but very crowded, and twice as expansive as Lublin or Toruń (cause prices are adjusted for foreigners).

There are a lot of dairy products and pork products that come from Felanitx and Artá, so there are probably some farms out there as well.  I have lived on the mainland of Spain too, in Andalucía (Granada, Sevilla) and found that Mallorca seemed to have a better quality of vegetables, fruit, dairy, meat - which I attributed to it growing most of what you can buy in stores.  I think it would be the perfect place for you two, or maybe Menorca or Ibiza (though I haven't been to either).  All this being said, I'm not sure at all about the water rights.

Hmm, dubito.

Parte dell'elettorato PD digerirebbe male un accordo con Monti (che può chiedere quello che vuole, ma comunque Napolitano gli presenta il conto), ma un accordo con Berlusconi sarebbe un suicidio.  Poi, che Silvio ci provi è un altro discorso...

Monti si è indebolito come persona, ma non come voti. Nel suo piccolo ha circa il doppio dei voti di Casini nel 2008, quindi non va così male. Probabilmente perderà qualcosa da qua al 24 febbraio, come pure Grillo, ma comunque rimane l'ago della bilancia.

Considerando solo il caso in cui il PD non ha la maggioranza al Senato. Bersani dovrebbe avere la maggioranza assoluta o quasi alla camera (47-48% circa).  La vera domanda è chi prenderà più senatori tra SEL (che ha percentuali basse ma si gode il premio di maggioranza fornitogli dal PD) e Monti (che rischia per gli sbarramenti, vedi mia spiegazione della legge elettorale).

Perché alleandosi con Monti, Bersani rischia di perdere Vendola. Io non mi stupirei di un fuggi fuggi dal Pdl verso Monti _dopo_ le elezioni (una volta evitato il rischio sbarramento) con conseguente alleanza Bersani-Monti.

However, lets hypothetically consider the notion that Shetland remains within the UK, they'd have right to a large chunk of the oil right?

Not quite.

It's a pretty long read, so I'll highlight the relevant bits (Can't actually copy / paste from the PDF)

Page 105 (Drawing illustrating what a potential EEZ would look like if Orkney and Shetland remained within the UK)

Further moving onto addressing the article however:

&gt;Shetland’s residents have traditionally been hostile to Scottish independence and prefer Westminster government to that from Holyrood.

I view that with HEAVY amounts of scepticism. The Shetlanders are hostile towards any form of mainland rule, the drive I see there is for greater local rule, not for London rule.

&gt;Mr Scott challenged the First Minister to “accept that fact”. When Shetland's local authority held a referendum 35 years ago asking if residents wanted to be part of an independent Scotland, the result was nine to one against.

35 years ago. Is the man having a laugh?

35 years ago, Thatcher was electable. 

35 years ago, Scotland was in the grip of poverty, and had the worst standards of living in Western Europe.

Non è che rischia, spera. L'unica cosa di cui ha bisogno è una situazione dei numeri tale da consentirgli di far passare la rinuncia a Vendola - ovviamente imposta da Monti in modo draconiano - come doloroso ma necessario sacrificio a maggior gloria della governabilità. Bersani sono quindici anni che in un modo o nell'altro viene mandato a casa dall'alleato di sinistra con cui sta governando, e la tentazione di scongiurare in partenza l'eventualità tutto sommato è umana

Il che porta a

&gt; Io non mi stupirei di un fuggi fuggi dal Pdl verso Monti dopo le elezioni 

Qui invece il rischio è più che concreto. Tanto che ci si gioca a carte anche abbastanza scoperte. Da una parte Monti dichiara apertamente di avere questo in testa (vedi il passaggio sull'auspicio della ""cooperazione tra i punti riformisti che sono in ogni partito"" che ha fatto [nel suo pippone](http://tg24.sky.it/tg24/politica/2013/01/12/mario_monti_pd_fassina_berlusconi_bersani.html) di stamattina) e di voler provare a fare dopo il voto quell'operazione di disarticolazione forzata di Pdl e Pd che prima non gli era riuscita. Dall'altra Berlusconi si sta apparecchiando delle liste per il Senato dove i meno fedeli sono Dell'Utri e Fede e che gli consentono di opporre una mutanda in tungsteno ai tentativi di penetrazione di Monti.

C'è però da tenere conto di un altro aspetto. Ovvero che il prossimo Parlamento, specie all'inizio, avrà una mobilità spaventosa. Per il combinato disposto della necessità di imbullonare una maggioranza sia pure col pallottoliere e dell'inesperienza totale di un numero mai così alto di parlamentari, le transumanze intergruppo saranno massicce. E Monti qui rischia almeno quanto i partiti. L'unico scenario in cui Monti attrae e basta è quello dove è andato molto meglio di Sel, ha un saldo senatori talmente vantaggioso da poter fare qualsiasi prezzo, la gente borderline dei partiti capisce che di là ci sono più prospettive che di qua e sente l'improvviso bisogno di andare a rafforzare l'area moderata. Ma se Monti va meno che benissimo i ruoli si ribaltano e ad attrarre diventano i partiti (soprattutto il Pd). Nel caso, squadre squilibratissime: di qua vecchi volponi che le hanno viste e fatte tutte, di là distinti signori che fino a un mese fa facevano altro e che sono entrati in Parlamento salendo (e nemmeno sempre con tutto questo entusiasmo) sopra un taxi.

Let me guess... Marseille ? Toulouse ? Montpellier ?

No, it is not natural behaviour, and he only wants to get in your pants, like every guy you would say, but he definitely has no consideration for the other gender. Kissing one other on the cheeks without prior consent is borderline sexual harassment.
You can only kiss someone on the cheeks only after formal introduction. It can be used in the professional environment but only on the same hierarchy level, ie you would certainly not kiss with your boss or someone in HR.

Also, he was wearing sportswear, right ?

The point of this little game: 

It is a national sport in our slums for youngsters to aboard nice looking girls in the street to get their number. The point is not seduction but pure machism and domination amongst the social group. These people are only after trophies, and certainly not seduction or romance.
