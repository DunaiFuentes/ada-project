*""4.2 EU funding 
In Spain (according to the Oscar Faber Study), 1994 to mid-1999 resources (actual expenditure including Structural and Cohesion Funds as well as EIB, and national resources) focussed on road (77%), rail (16.5%), ports (3.8%), air (1.6%), other / mixed modes (1.2%). One reason provided for lower expenditure on rail projects is that project design is more demanding and implementation more complicated than for roads.   
The Objective 1 Ex Post Evaluation (1994-1999) mentions that 19% of total SF resources (excluding CF) are dedicated to roads, 2% to rail, around 1% to ports and 1% to airports. The year 1999 marks an increasing focus on rail, and the Strategic Reference Framework for 2000-2006 introduces a focus on high-speed rail, improved road access to France and Portugal and improved port conditions.   
Looking at the Cohesion Fund allocations during 2002-2004, it is noteworthy that EU contributions worth 3,333.5 million € went to rail, followed by 837.6 million € for maritime transport, and only 430.6 million € for road transport.   
4.3 Other sources of financing 
This section gives an overview of other sources of financing for transport infrastructure.""*  
 
*""EIB The EIB has provided a substantial number of loans (more than 200) in the period 1994- 2006 amounting to in total approximately 22.2 bn€. The overall distribution of loans is: road 28%, rail 23%, urban public transport 24%, aviation 22% and ports 3%.   
The last decade the loans for the rail sector are dominated by the investments done in the high speed rail lines.   
The urban public transport loans are almost all related to feasibility studies and construction of new metro lines in Barcelona, Madrid, Malaga, Seville, Valencia and Bilbao. It also includes loans for the purchase and lease of rolling stock.   
Part of the recent EIB loans is also dedicated to PPP projects, especially in the road sector namely motorways (Santiago Brion, de Los Vinedos) and in urban public transport for the metro in Madrid.""*

And folk begin tae tak the gate.

Gettin fou and unco happy,

The mosses, watters, slaps and styles, 

That lie between us and oor hame, 

Whaur sits oor sulky, sullen dame, 

Gathering her brow like gathering storm, 

Nursing her wrath tae keep it warm.



This truth fand honest Tam O'Shanter,

Auld Ayr, wham na'er a toon surpasses, 

Fur honest men and bonny lassies! 

Oh Tam, hadst thou but been sae wise, 

And taen thy ain wife Kate's advice, 

She told thee weel thou wast a skellum, 

A blethering, blustering drunken blellum, 

That fae November til October, 

Ae market day, thou wisnae sober, 

And in the Lord's Hoose, 

Even oan Sunday, 

Thou drank wi Kirkton Jean til Monday! 

She prophesised that, late or soon, 

Thou would be found drowned deep in Doon,

I forgot what it was exactly but it was very well written just after WW2 at a time where everyone wanted to make the most just society in Germany, also the fact that WW2 happened made for a constitution without alot of the loopholes and exemption clauses in the text. Also the texts are really clear and clean cut, no vague definitions. 

Only thing I kinda dislike is the specific term ""Germans"" in the constitution, A lot of rights are only for Germans and immigrants could be excluded if the text was interpret very strictly. 
(Though EU law ensures that countries need to treat all EU citizens the same, resulting in the fact that you could read EU citizens instead of Germans)

Another thing I really like is that the constitution is actually used. this might sound weird, But in the Netherlands we don't have a constitutional court. basically, if we want any rights protected in some sort of constitution here we need to look at European and worldwide treaties.

true,rumnscurvy,Centre,Centre,"Tours is nice and all but definitely the quieter and smaller of the three. It *does* boast the highest bar density in the country, its medieval quarter is essentially wall to wall eateries and bars, it's a lot of fun. But I guess if you're bringing the kids, this may not be very high on your priorities list! The region is also very nice for family visits, there's a big range of zoos, aquariums and kid-friendly museums around. When they're a bit older they can start touring the many, many castles and gardens littered all around the valley, there is a lot to do! Coming from abroad, the Tours region is purportedly the region of France with the least accent, or the clearest French. Both Strasbourg and Montpellier have a somewhat pronounced accent (nothing like Marseilles or Lille, but still noteworthy)

I believe you may be right in thinking that Tours would be cheapest in terms of housing, in that the city itself is quite small but has really big metropolitan area, several times the area of the town itself. Many of those outer towns, still very much connected to the city itself (if only by the public transport services) would offer you affordable accommodation. Don't try and get one in the city centre, especially if you intend to drive, it can be quite difficult to navigate by car in some of the central areas. The area around the university is fine though, it's no trouble at all to access it, being built in parts right next to a major axis.  

Strasbourg and Montpellier are both much, much bigger cities, which has its advantages but is also more hassle of course. Since I haven't actually studied at the University of Tours I find myself stretched to comment on its quality, but I would say that unless you're studying something related to medicine, your academic prospects would be best fulfilled elsewhere. The university is large enough to offer a big range of courses but not famous enough to attract a broad range of people from all over the country. The proximity with Paris doesn't help, of course, the university suffers from brain drain quite a bit.

true,brdtwrk,UNSA,United States of America,"As an American living in Germany, here are some of my favorite things about Germany:

- The beauty of the landscape: I live in one of the more rural areas of Germany. Everything is green rolling hills with deep forested ridges where the rivers and streams flow. This makes for many wonderful hiking trails, stunning vistas around castles, and gorgeous river towns along the Mosel and Rhine. I've been living here over 2 years and still I am wowed and feel so lucky to live here. And of course Bavaria's mountains are incredible.

- Everything has such a longstanding history that can be traced back much much longer than the US has even been a country. There's a village near me that recently celebrated it's 800th anniversary. That is just so awesome to me.

- Hefeweizen: Ooh hefeweizen how I love you. I never really liked beer until I came to Germany and had a hefeweizen. Now I can't get enough. König Ludwig, Rothaus, Hofbräuhaus, Erdinger, etc. All so very delicious.

- Schnitzel: What can I say? Schnitzel is great! It's a fairly plain dish, even with some kind of topping on it, but I still enjoy tasting it at any restaurant that has it. Except for that shitty frozen schniztel you find at very touristy places.

- The very logical way the German culture operates, from how they interact with people (which can sometimes be misconstrued as coldness by my fellow Americans), to the way the laws are constructed.

My wife and I absolutely love Germany and German culture. We have a great relationship with our landlord/friends. My only wish is that I had more time and energy to devote to really learning the German language. My skills can get me through a restaurant visit but that's about the extent.",0,1376083541,null,0,false,0,cbki7ru,t3_1k0v6l,t1_cbki7ru,t3_1k0v6l,null,1429885113,18,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,18

No. You don't need any kind of visa. You have the right to live and work in the EU.

No. The only way you can lose your American citizenship is if you renounce or if you get naturalized in countries that don't allow duel citizenship. But you'll need to file American taxes no matter where you live.

Yes.

If you get married then after three years of continual PR in Germany and with adequate knowledge of German and the legal system and the country she could apply for German citizenship but she would be required to renounce her American citizenship first or she will automatically lose it.

Yes. That's the only option for at lest 3 years anyway. Also, being a student wont count towards her years of PR. I'm not sure if she would be allowed to work or if she would need to obtain a work permit if you're married. [Here](http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/Infoservice/FAQ/ArbeitenLebenDeutschland/06-Ehepartner.html?nn=479790) is information on it.

Just be aware that renouncing American citizenship can cause you issues in the future. If you ever plan to move back to the US getting a visa can be much harder. And even though as a German citizenship she has an automatic 3 month tourist visa, the government isn't very nice to Americans who renounce and there's always the chance she could be forbidden from entering even though she is married to a citizen. Like the government really really doesn't like when people renounce. They give out fake numbers to make it seem like less people renounce than actually do and when people do renounce they close the entire embassy. And the US is only making it harder for citizens to live abroad. Banks are often refusing Americans because there's more hassle on them because of new laws.

Of course, as an American citizen living abroad you're double taxed so even if you moved to the EU and never lived in the US again you will need to file a tax return every year (and the paperwork is insanely confusing from what I understand) and if you make over $95k you will need to pay taxes in both countries.

&gt; I assume that German citizenship implies EU citizenship.

EU citizenship doesn't actually exist. It's just a term people use to refer to the fact that people who are citizens of EU countries can live and work anywhere in the EU. It's just a technicality, but just so you don't think EU citizenship is an actual thing.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Haven't been there since 1976, but there were a number of things I loved about Germany. The BEER. Coming from the land of weak beer (back then), my first two German beers kicked my ass. Also, it comes in 8-packs, and is delicious.

I liked how neat and tidy everything was. Towns, villages, peoples yards, all pretty clean and appearing *organized*. There were even people who would pick up sticks in the forest! Okay, that might have been a little obsessive. Roads were all well-kept, and it seemed like there was interest in keeping them in good condition. Houses even had ""decorations"" or artwork on the outside of them, at least in Aschaffenburg.

Going to some of the smaller villages was like traveling back in time. Seriously, if it hadn't been for the modern vehicles and pavement.... Also, 2.56 Marks to the Dollar was another plus. Too bad I was a lowly private with no money.

All the Turks in the parks in Frankfurt had chunks of hashish, camel shit, or waxy concoctions hidden under nearby bushes. Hopefully you would find the first guy, and he wouldn't rob you.

Never got over to East Germany, but did get to ""hang out"" at the border area a couple times during field exercises. The guard towers seemed pretty well constructed, and trying to cross seemed like it would have presented a real challenge. Well, as a person. Those tank divisions would have sliced right through the Fulda Gap in no time. Ha, our expected lifespan in case of war was 3 minutes. 

There seemed to be an old castle on virtually every hilltop. I saw so many piles of stone in various conditions, as I drove around through the woods in my jeep. Also, for some reason, those elevated chair seat things were kinda cool. Right in the edge of the woods, overlooking the fields. They were about 10 or 12 feet high, and would be like a super tall chair, with a 10 foot ladder on the front. They were everywhere, but I never found out what that was all about. 

The German people were friendly, and the ones I met seemed smart and well educated. People in the small villages could be a bit standoffish, but that was probably due more to being a clueless young American soldier (often in a convoy of 20-30 vehicles) than anything else. Really, I loved the food, the beer, and the people. Germany is a great country.",0,1376092315,null,0,false,0,cbkl6l8,t3_1k0v6l,t1_cbkl6l8,t3_1k0v6l,null,1429883717,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

In some parts of the word there just hadn't been any crops that allowed people to harvest enough of a surplus to free others of agricultural work. In others there hadn't been animals that could be domesticated for their meat or even put before a plow. If your entire population is tied down doing agricultural work just to have enough to eat, there's nobody who can specialize in crafts or innovate.  

There's much more to it, though, well worth watching.

true,Maldorno,null,null,"&gt;Ben quand tu trouves les arguments de quelqu'un ridicule, ça détermine quand même ton opinion des personnes qui les défendent.

L'opinion chez Eolas précède les arguments. C'est un peu le principe d'une veille citoyenne. C'est son opinion qui préside à la création de son blog en premier lieu. 

&gt;Mais comment tu veux dire, de façon respectueuse et neutre, que des gens déclament des mensonges sur des sujets qu'ils ne comprennent pas du tout ?

Quels mensonges ? Eolas parle de droit, bien. Mais la cuistrerie qui l'étouffe lui fait prendre pour argent comptant des propos dont il ignore ( peut-être sciemment ) la portée en ne se mettant pas à la portée de ceux qui les disent. 

&gt;Parce que objectivement, ils ont eu un amateurisme législatif total et les libérations de criminels qui vont surement bientôt avoir lieu

L'erreur est humaine, hein. Qui n'a pas vu la faute ? Les juristes du ministère qui ont écrit la loi, les juristes du conseil d'Etat qui ont émis un avis sur cette loi, les parlementaires des commissions des deux chambres qui l'ont étudiée, les parlementaires qui ont voté la loi. Outre le fait que traiter le Conseil d'Etat de caniche UMP est risible, le Parlement est responsable dans son entier qu'un texte de piètre qualité soit voté. Ce qui m'énerve, c'est qu'Eolas le sait parfaitement mais il fait du rabattage politique. 

&gt;ainsi que la condamnation de la France dans le cadre des gardes à vues, qui ont invalidé presque un an de PV de GAV, le montrent bien. 

Eolas a beau être parfait, l'application de certaines jurisprudences européennes n'est pas si simple que ça. Peut-être que les gouvernements UMP successifs ont pensé avoir fait les ajustements nécessaires, alors que ce n'était pas le cas. Peut-être ont-ils joué la montre sous la pression des syndicats de police qui leur juraient que la GAV était le seul moyen de faire leur boulot. La France étant inréformable, ils ont choisi de porter leur attention sur un autre front. 

&gt;Mais comment tu veux dire, de façon respectueuse et neutre, que des gens déclament des mensonges sur des sujets qu'ils ne comprennent pas du tout ?

Tout simplement parce qu'en tant que juriste, il est parfaitement et totalement conscient qu'il est excessivement facile de prendre dans la masse d'idiots des paroles idiotes, de les monter en mayonnaise pour jeter le discrédit sans pour autant avoir apporté quoique ce soit au débat. Dans le fond, qu'on soit d'accord ou pas, il est évident que l'adoption du mariage amène au prochain combat qui est la PMA, puis au suivant qui est la GPA. Personne n'en doute. Que des politiciens démago ou des manifestants incultes l'expriment mal ( Frigide Barjot, c'est pas une intellectuelle, je pense qu'on l'a compris ) ne change pas grand chose. 

Cette attitude de je-sais-tout est justifiée quand il s'attaquait à des ministres, elle ne l'est pas quand il s'agit de taper indistinctement sur des gens qui ont aussi le droit d'avoir une opinion. Il donne l'impression de démontrer quelque chose mais ce n'est pas le cas.

Then the working bit is totally stereotype. We're not robots that work from 8 to 5. We also have our chit-chat and stuff. Also the working hours really depend on the job. For example, if you're working in an administrative job, most of the time you can choose to start sometime between 7 to 9:30. 

As someone else said, the Kindergarden bit is totally nuts. I've never heard about a Waldkindergarten. The average Kindergarden doesn't look like that.

PGP relies in part on public key encryption, which is a type of encryption in which you have a public key and a private key. The public key can be shared with as many people as you want (it's usually on servers for ease of use even). 

Then, if someone wants to send you a message they encrypt it using your *public key*. The beauty of this technique is that you're the only one who can decrypt that message, since it takes the *private key* belonging to the public key to do that. Of course, that private key is usually encrypted with a passphrase as well.

Edit: [this flowchart](http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/dynimg/IC155063.gif) explains it way better than I do.

There is no real alternative for the car in NL, the only alternative there is in public transport is practically equally or more expensive. Given this economic choice, people will choose the car because it allows more freedom. And it is much quicker in all cases.

I've lived in Amsterdam and worked in Utrecht, commuted daily. The cost by public transport would be around 18€ a day. The cost by car  around 16€ (inlcuding all taxes, etc.) That's how expensive our public transport is. If you wonder why everybody drives a car, that's why. There is hardly an alternative, only when you live and work close to the station.

Paying extra just because you happen to live within the bounds of a city... that's not a realistic solution. A realistic solution is lowering the cost of public transport, but since it is privatised (thank you neo-liberals) we don't have that power anymore.

Tens of thousands of customers sued their banks and won in court. The laws are in effect, but still largely ignored. Since the abuses were ongoing for several years, if forced to pay back the money, banks may find themselves short 1bil EUR, losses not easily sustainable in such times. Therefore, in the interests of the financial system, the government, central bank and IMF are determined to overturn the law or to retroactively make those practices legal, even against EU law.

true,la_pluie,null,null,"**PRICE**

* The cheapest tickets are called the ""Billet Francilien"" which is open to everyone. However, there are also certain conditions like you just need to book the tickets at least 5 days before the date of visit.

*Until September 30* - The price of the 1 day/1 park Billet Francilien Adult is 39€ during the week and 45€ during the weekend, while the 1 day/2 parks Adult costs 49€. 

*Until November 7* - The price of the regular ticket for 1 day/1 park Adult costs 62€, while the 1 day/2 parks Adult costs 74€.

(Note - you can't buy the tickets now and use them for your visit after the listed dates.)

* If you're willing to work a bit harder, there are always people scalping discounted Disneyland tickets on [LeBonCoin](http://www.leboncoin.fr/billetterie/offres/ile_de_france/?f=a&amp;th=1&amp;q=disneyland) - a popular French version of Craigslist. Watch out for scams and all that jazz though.

* Sometimes [Groupon](https://www.groupon.fr/mon-compte/imprimer/4CECA36134) will offer deals to Disneyland. I attached my already-used purchase to give you an idea. 


**TRANSPORTATION**

* Metro/RER A - The cheapest and fastest option if you're arriving from within the city. Cost is 15.65€ for a ""Mobilis"" ticket which you can use multiple times all day from Paris in zone 1 to all the way to Disneyland in zone 5. The RER is the name for the set of trains that service the suburb Ile-de-France area outside of Paris and the A line is the one you need to take. The stop is Marne-la-Vallée – Chessy and takes about 45 minutes.
(Note - RER A gets extremely crowded with both tourists and residents alike. Beware of pickpockets. Also be wary of what time the metro/RER closes. It depends on the day, but usually after midnight.)

* [Disneyland Paris Express](http://disneylandparis-express.com/) - If you want a more hassle-free experience, this is the one to take. For 82€, you are offered a round trip shuttle transportation and entry to one park of your choosing (for 89€, you get both parks) The pickup is from assorted locations around Paris but runs at a very particular schedule (8ish AM pickup and 8 PM departure from Disneyland). Unfortunately, this is not advisable if you want to stay late to watch the fireworks.

* Eurostar - Only if you're arriving from London St. Pancras. 

**DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PARKS**

* Disneyland Park - Similar to the traditional Disney ""theme"" park because it centers around the fairy tale aspects and familiar Disney characters. So yes, you will find many more of the princesses here. It is the original thus larger with more rides, restaurants, boutiques. Sleeping Beauty's castle can be found here, with a really cool hidden dragon lair underneath. The Disney Dreams! nighttime spectacular including fireworks, water fountains, lasers, animated projections, and other special effects takes place with the castle as the backdrop. 

* Walt Disney Studios - More of an ""attraction"" park with more thrilling rides and multiple live-audience shows. Much smaller but with equally long lines. Fun to go if you have the time, but not all that necessary for one day visits.

(Note - if you've been to the American Disney parks, you should note that the Paris Disney parks are roller-coaster heavy and that alcohol is served on the premises. Also, while there are designated smoking areas, they are largely ignored and security really isn't enforced.

**TIPS**

* It will be unforgivingly wet and cold during December/January. Bring an umbrella and wear water-resistant shoes.. You won't regret that extra pair of socks.

* Everyone tends to arrive in the morning/early afternoon, which makes the lines horrendous. However, I have noticed that the majority of families drop off like flies come early evening (4-7). Less kids = less lines. You can do yourself a favor by sleeping a couple extra hours and arriving in the afternoon. That extra energy will keep you to the fireworks at night and the long ride back later on.

* If you need a break, stop at the Hyperion Ampitheatre where there are tons of seating, a eating hall (burgers), and Disney cartoon shorts on repeat. During December, they should have holiday singers as well.

* It's called Disneyland Paris now.. They changed their name about 20 years ago.


Source - I'm obsessed with Disney if you haven't guessed by now. I also lived in Paris for the past 3 years and visited the parks 6 times within that time. If you have anymore questions, just ask and I'd be happy to help!

It has been deteriorating for two decades. 

Also, health care is free and of good quality. High taxes and expensive shop prices, though, which I personally consider a reasonable trade-off for important public services everyone uses.

I do understand that there still is a very high number of people who suffer from depression and high suicide and alcoholism rates, despite good public services and ranking high on happiest country indexes. Can anyone explain this? Is it the long winters?

Clearly (if you insist on it being a choice) the choice that people make now when they are faced with this choice is in most cases staying wherever they live. Taking in consideration friends, relatives, services and their personal economical situation. Which are much more important for a persons well-being than a nice job and should be prioritised by any sane person.

If you are young and not specifically tied to a location by partner, child, services, family, friends and/or financial commitments like a loan on a house... than your reaction is somewhat understandable. But it's not realistic. Your solution is taxing the pursuit of a happy and stable life.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"By ""secret"" you mean in a secure manner (as opposed to in a clandestine way, which would be pointless since ""they"" can see you sending encrypted mail)? 

If so, then it depends if you can verify the other person's identity e.g., by phone or Skype. PGP uses key pairs of a public and a private key. The latter you always keep to yourself, but as the name implies the public key can (even should) be as widely distributed as possible. You can simply send it by unencrypted mail or publish it on your website. They have a finger print (a cryptographic hash, think of it as a check sum), so if you know the other person's voice you can simply call and verify it to rule out any tampering before you add it to your key ring.

After you have securely exchanged keys with somebody, you can securely share any other keys in your key ring. The way a private/public key pair works is that whatever gets encrypted with your public key can only be decrypted with your private one, but it also works the other way round. That is, what you encrypt with your *private* key can only be decrypted with your *public* key. This is neat property means that you can sign documents -- you generate its hash and encrypt it with your *private* key. The recipient then decrypts this signature with your ~~*private*~~ Edit: *public* (d'oh!) key, generates the hash of the document, and compares. If the hashes match, then the signature is valid and must have been sent by you (well, by somebody who has access to your private key).

So, let's say that after you've securely exchanged keys you need the key of a third person, whom you don't know well enough to be able to verify the keys with yourself. If someone you have securely exchanged keys with does, that one can sign the third person's key. You can then add that key to your key ring and mark it as trust worthy after verifying the signature of the person you already have a good key from. That person essentially vouches for the third person's key.  
Keys can be signed by many others, and each signature includes a rating of confidence the signatory party has in the key's authenticity. If enough people you trust have signed it with a good confidence rating, you can add your own signature to it, thereby improving the ""web of trust"".",0,1376127677,null,0,1376134621,0,cbku3nc,t3_1k14xo,t1_cbku3nc,t1_cbknaoh,null,1429879485,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

For Germany, first real German state in the modern sense, the second reich only started in 1871.

It is a concept based on a shared language and a shared culture. So it does not have to do that much with unification or even the different kind of state forms we went through since 1871.

Why should I feel sympathy for the Serbs, of all nations that suffered perceived injustices throughout history? See as a Hungarian I don't really do feel for them, they massacred at least 40,000 Hungarian civilians in Vojvodina at the end of WW2, often brutally torturing them, like impalement etc. In my opinion most Orthodox Slavic peoples (Russians and Serbians at least) are really pathetic losers full of butthurt and false bravado, fake masculinity, they also think that they were the only ones who were victims of injustices throughout history, that they were always on the ""good"" side and that the evil Western world is so, so ungrateful for their supposed good deeds. Maybe only Arabs beat them in that regard.
So I'd say Serbs had it coming, that's what you get when you're starting a war to keep together an empire (the former Yugoslavia) or at least to create a Greater Serbia, then losing 4 wars in 10 years and also when you count on Mother Russia as your big brother that will protect you from the evil West. The result was as one might expect  Now they don't laugh. Neither did all those Arab countries who counted on the same with Soviet Union/Russia.

Cette loi ne change strictement rien à la situation parfaitement bancale qu'on a: les PMA et GPA faites à l'étranger sont, comme avant, légalisées par l'adoption. La seule nouveauté est que les homos peuvent désormais adopter en couple et ne sont plus obligés de désigner un parent comme tuteur légal et l'autre comme conjoint-accessoire.

Eolas d'ailleurs parle de cette situation, en profite pour la tacler et trouve qu'on devrait arrêter l'hypocrisie et rendre PMA et GPA légales en France avec un cadre respectant les droits de chacun. Je suis pas sur d'être de son avis, mais il a le mérité de l'exposer et d'être cohérent.

&gt; On a aussi le droit de ne pas vouloir vivre sous la coupe d'un technocésariste qui mêle le ""j'ai raison"" à l'""aimez-moi"".

Qui vous force à lire son blog ou à l'aimer ? 

&gt; Donc seuls les comparses d'Eolas sont appelés à se prononcer ? Si les cons ne votaient pas, on n'aurait plus ce genre de problèmes, non ? Etc, etc. La nouvelle gauche est vraiment ultra-réactionnaire, en vérité.

Gni ? Mais vous avez tout à fait le droit de dire des conneries, et on a tout à fait le droit de les dénoncer. On est en démocratie. Je vois pas trop le rapport avec la gauche à vrai dire. Savoir de quoi on parle n'est pas vraiment corrélé à une couleur politique...

&gt; Oué, ok. C'est exactement ce que je dis. Il y a une absence de volonté de voir le point de vue adverse.

Quand y a une incapacité à l'exprimer de façon cohérente ou à répondre aux arguments des contradicteurs, faut pas trop pleurer. Comme dans tous les mouvements sociaux (de droite comme de gauche) les messages sont nombreux, tous un peu différents, parfois un peu vagues. C'est pas trop nouveau. Mais dans les mouvements cohérents, souvent, on peut pointer vers des intellectuels qui tentent de le défendre, d'y amener des arguments cohérents. Vous avez qui comme telle figure de proue ? J'aimerais bien voir ses réponses à Eolas.

Dés la promulgation de la loi, des magistrats ont vu la faute et l'ont signalée. C'est pas remonté. L'erreur est humaine, mais on dit également que l'erreur devient une faute quand on refuse de la corriger. Moi aussi je connais des dictons à deux sous.

&gt; Peut-être que les gouvernements UMP successifs ont pensé avoir fait les ajustements nécessaires, alors que ce n'était pas le cas.

Oui, ils l'ont prétendu en tous cas, malgré des jugements contraires de la CEDH qu'ils ont simplement ignorés. Erreur, erreur et faute. C'était des mauvais.

Ben voyons. C'est vrai que l'UMP n'a jamais réussi à passer des lois de réforme judiciaire (presque une par an)...

true,PointAndClick,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt;Then choose another job closer to home

The entire reason that people get jobs further away is because it's a better job than they can get closer to home. And they don't want to leave their place for a variety of reasons, and those reasons are fine. There is nothing wrong with it. And the point is that it should not be forced with taxes. 

The question was, how do we get less cars on the road. Than more taxation clearly is not the answer. You force more people into jobs closer to home that they do not want, are not satisfying, etc. Or you force people away from family friends, and all the things I mentioned.

&gt; It is up to each and every person to evaluate if that's acceptable to them and make their choices accordingly.

So the point is, how is taxing car ownership in cities going to help people make choices? If anything it is forcing people into behavior they didn't choose, being perfectly happy working an hour away. 

And again, let me reiterate, there is no alternative in our public transportation system. So these natural and completely sane choices that people make choosing a job and choosing a place to live, are not being accommodated for in terms of public transport. And now you say, well people need to stop being normal and make normal choices, they just need to suck it up and live somewhere else or work somewhere else. Because we need less cars on the road, you're willing to do that? 

The simple solution is making public transport cheaper and more accessible so that people can go where they want and do what they want, what they would have otherwise only been realistically able to do with a car. We need to create an alternative. Not force people to change their lives, it's not fair and it's not realistic to belief that people will.",0,1376133622,null,0,false,0,cbkus8h,t3_1k1wi6,t1_cbkus8h,t1_cbku6b6,null,1429879166,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Much of Dublin is red-brick terraces built for workers over the years. They used red-brick because empty cargo boats coming from England would use cheap red cinderblocks as ballast, these would be unloaded in Dublin, replaced with cargo, and shipped out. The cinderblocks were then used to build houses. [You can see a fairly typical old style Dublin street here.](https://maps.google.ie/maps?q=Manor+Street,+Dublin&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=53.35168,-6.286129&amp;spn=0.000609,0.001321&amp;sll=54.115746,-9.166789&amp;sspn=0.027268,0.084543&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Manor+St,+Dublin,+County+Dublin+City&amp;z=20&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.35168,-6.286129&amp;panoid=3GrVXmi7GUvNcY-61Lsdjw&amp;cbp=12,96.81,,0,5.03) There's also the more upmarket georgian townhouses in more well off areas, [you can see an example of these here](https://maps.google.ie/maps?q=Henrietta+Street,+Dublin&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=53.35244,-6.269914&amp;spn=0.001218,0.002642&amp;sll=53.335383,-6.240835&amp;sspn=0.027574,0.084543&amp;oq=Henrietta+Street&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Henrietta+St,+Dublin,+County+Dublin&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.35244,-6.269914&amp;panoid=vJozlWnFAdPMQkXCSpXQFQ&amp;cbp=12,330.17,,0,-11.15) as you can see, many of these are in disrepair. In terms of newer developments, much of the south city dates from the 1950s, many council flats were built and many still exist, such as [these](https://maps.google.ie/maps?q=Dolphin%27s+Barn,+Dublin&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=53.334185,-6.29449&amp;spn=0.003447,0.010568&amp;sll=53.345838,-6.267958&amp;sspn=0.027567,0.084543&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Dolphins+Barn,+County+Dublin&amp;z=17&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.333776,-6.295389&amp;panoid=YxyuBEzWn-8hgxqD2nqs3Q&amp;cbp=12,217.75,,0,0), you also see many of these in the North inner city, they have a bad reputation for crime and drugs, but actually many of the flats have strong, active communities, maintaining a good standard of living for everyone there, some are definitely bad though. In the older, poorer suburbs, a lot of houses were built to exactly the same design over miles and miles of it. Crumlin, Kimmage, Walkinstown and parts of Tallaght have [exactly this design](https://maps.google.ie/maps?q=Slievemore+Road,+Dublin&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=53.328145,-6.316311&amp;spn=0.001724,0.005284&amp;sll=53.333775,-6.295391&amp;sspn=0.003472,0.010568&amp;oq=Slievemore+&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Slievemore+Rd,+Dublin,+County+Dublin&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.328145,-6.316311&amp;panoid=w-Re4JBAB7wUGBFZ1JDouw&amp;cbp=12,312.16,,0,5.57). 

A lot of Dublin's commuter belt outside the M50, and suburbs of other cities would look pretty much like [this, with the green area in the middle, and newish houses surrounding.](https://maps.google.ie/maps?q=Earlsfort+Terrace,+Lucan&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=53.346903,-6.420898&amp;spn=0.001723,0.005284&amp;sll=53.334525,-6.258237&amp;sspn=0.006894,0.021136&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Earlsfort+Rd,+Lucan,+County+Dublin&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.346903,-6.420898&amp;panoid=kjaIUXX_jxeQKyVL3Hrl0Q&amp;cbp=12,244.71,,0,5.21)

Other cities would be similar with some distinctive characteristics, on the west coast you get limestone thick walls and small windows on older houses to resist the wind, and different stone depending on the area.

More modern houses are painted yellow (why), with plastic double-glazing, and are more open plan with larger rooms. A lot of these were built in the 2000s and many lie abandoned or unfinished beside small villages after the crash in 2008. [Here's one where people actually live](https://maps.google.ie/maps?q=Boyle,+Co.+Roscommon&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=53.974125,-8.28262&amp;spn=0.00171,0.005284&amp;sll=53.35506,-6.427002&amp;sspn=0.055122,0.169086&amp;oq=Boyle,+Co+Ros&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Boyle,+County+Roscommon&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.974125,-8.28262&amp;panoid=pKeCZjM0ydfDHTCq6xKhxA&amp;cbp=12,181.65,,0,-0.46)

Out in rural areas, most houses are one-storey, with large gardens, large windows, sort of extended bungalos with extensions and outbuildings all over the place. [Example here](https://maps.google.ie/maps?q=Boyle,+Co.+Roscommon&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=53.901887,-8.255758&amp;spn=0.000857,0.002642&amp;sll=53.35506,-6.427002&amp;sspn=0.055122,0.169086&amp;oq=Boyle,+Co+Ros&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Boyle,+County+Roscommon&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.901887,-8.255758&amp;panoid=LfB2pUUsbGnYnjqrnBrLeA&amp;cbp=12,121.62,,0,9.32) another, better example [here](https://maps.google.ie/maps?q=Boyle,+Co.+Roscommon&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=53.820672,-8.226702&amp;spn=0.000858,0.002642&amp;sll=53.35506,-6.427002&amp;sspn=0.055122,0.169086&amp;oq=Boyle,+Co+Ros&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Boyle,+County+Roscommon&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.820672,-8.226702&amp;panoid=75BA9Mof5E29Td8muvF0cQ&amp;cbp=12,89.5,,0,11.06&amp;z=19)",0,1376134192,null,0,1376144844,0,cbkuul7,t3_1k2ybf,t1_cbkuul7,t3_1k2ybf,null,1429879136,42,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,42

I don't care about the shitty conditions they live in. It's not my problem. Also, before you call Italy a mediocre country I should probably tell you that the HDI in Italy is higher than the one in the UK.

Also, I won't let them die because they are from another country. If they decided that they wan to cross the sea and risk their lives that's their problem. Not ours.

But I reccomend student's camp bases in Poland during summer - they are great for camping and very cheap. They are open during summer (usually june-august or september), you pay around $2 for a night in own tent, $3-$4 for a night in rented tent, or in a house (some bases have houses) there's campfire and free boiled water, some clean stream nearby for bathing, and these bases are spaced so that you can go from one to another in one day, and visit whole Polish mountains, and some other places. Usually there's some small village not too far, so you can buy basic food etc (and it's cheap, cause these places are the poorest in Poland).

You can also camp on somebodys terrain, but you have to ask for permission first. Many people agree. You cannot camp on the tourist trails (there are national park guards walking them quite often and they will fine you if you do).

No, I'm telling you that the long-term trend is for rising production efficiency, so the basic necessities of life take less and less people to produce. The recent happenings are just one step along the road. Doubtlessly some short term events and trends will reverse it a bit, but the tendency will be towards more unemployment: all employers have an individual interest to reduce their labor cost as much as possible, and as prices fall that will also cause wages to fall.

Happy to hear you know him! His books are treasures. Having red some of his novels is generally considered part of basic civilization over here (*Sinuhe, egyptiläinen* being the most popular must read). 

My personal favs:  
[Mikael Karvajalka &amp; Mikael Hakim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventurer_%28novel%29)  
[Johannes Angelos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Angel_%28Waltari%29)  
[Sinuhe, egyptiläinen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Egyptian)  
[Turms kuolematon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Etruscan)  

&gt; oh! Also his children - and detective stories are enjoyable.

Some of his *Komisario Palmu* detective stories were filmed in early '60s. The movies are actually quite good and Finnish classics (except the crappy last one). My fav one: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054001/

Also Michael Curtiz and Darryl F. Zanuck made [a spectacle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Egyptian_%28film%29) based on the historical novel *Sinuhe, egyptiläinen*, but you know Hollywood... 

Despite the movie (or because of it) Mika Waltari's *The Egyptian* remained the most sold foreign novel in the US until Umberto Eco's 'The Name of the Rose' surpassed it in the '80s.

&gt; ""No, per favore. Non scendiamo al livello infimo di dire “ma si era portato il passamontagna”, perché è anche peggio del “ma ha raccolto l’estintore”.
&gt;
&gt; A Genova ce l’avevo pure io, con me, il passamontagna (o meglio, il sottocasco di cotone), pur non avendo la minima intenzione di bruciare né assaltare camionette. Non ho avuto bisogno di usarlo, però ce l’avevo in tasca, per precauzione minima. Perché non sai mai cosa può succedere, a te, intorno a te, malgrado te, e in un contesto in cui basta essere filmati *vicino* a uno scontro per essere condannati ad anni e anni di galera, in cui basta essere passati di lì mezzo minuto prima proprio mentre una videocamera inquisiva ‘ndo cojo cojo, ci mancherebbe altro che uno si offre sorridente all’inquisizione, magari dicendo pure: “Cheese”.
Se si può ostacolare o rallentare in qualche modo questo modo macellaiesco di attribuire responsabilità penali, si fa. Avviene in tutto il mondo. Poi, se non succede nulla che costringa a travisarsi, benissimo. Ma il fatto che uno si porti dietro qualcosa per non essere identificato è puro illuminismo, per quel che mi riguarda, e va visto con la massima laicità. Per cui, “aveva il passamontagna” è un non-argomento.
&gt;
&gt; E’ un po’ come sentire quelli che dopo il 15 ottobre inveivano contro chiunque avesse un casco. Ricordo un marasma di commenti iper-forcaioli sotto le foto di una fila di manifestanti col casco *incordonati*. Era palesemente un servizio d’ordine, per quanto minimale. Quella gente stava cercando di mantenere saldo il proprio spezzone nel marasma, e possibilmente di portare a casa la propria gente senza rompersi il cranio. Ma per i commentatori da social network, quasi tutti *totali analfabeti di piazza*, quelli erano devastatori, in galera, in galera. Erano devastatori… perché avevano il casco!
&gt; Il casco l’ho portato anch’io a tanti cortei, per anni, e non mi è mai capitato di devastare un cazzo. L’ho portato perché non mi va di farmi spaccare la testa da un tonfa solo per non dare appigli ai moralisti.
Il casco è uno strumento di protezione dalla violenza. Certo, può essere anche usato come strumento offensivo… Ma in quel caso ce l’hai in mano, non in testa.""",0,1376142026,null,0,false,0,cbkw0f3,t3_1jubux,t1_cbkw0f3,t1_cbjex1r,null,1429878594,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

Tutta la bufera è nata perché qualcuno ha chiamato l'ispettrice, ed è stata lei a gettare benzina sul fuoco, insieme ai professori rompiscatole che aggiungono preghierine sotto i crocifissi e fanno firmare ai ragazzi lettere in cui si dichiarano ""turbati dall'assenza del crocifisso"".

E col senno di poi tutta questa disavventura è riuscita a svelare gli altarini. Molte persone, vicepreside in primis, hanno cambiato casacca per amor di tranquillità – allora perché hanno fatto storie per appendere il crocifisso?

E soprattutto, a questo punto le irregolarità della visita dell'ispettrice richiedono spiegazioni: il presidente di commissione che non viene avvertito, le insinuazioni sulla provenienza e la religione dell'autore dell'articolo, la professoressa che scappa in lacrime e chiede di andare all'ospedale, l'accenno a ""registrazioni e deposizioni"", l'evidente impreparazione – sia legale che umana – dell'ispettrice.

Houses depend on what part of the country you're in. I can only really speak for the area I'm from. I'm from Rijeka which features a mish-mash of various architectural styles of the different states that have held the city.

The buildings that survived WWII in the center are of the type you'd find in any larger central European city which makes sense considering they were built during Austrian, Hungarian, and Italian administration. There's a river canyon that stretches north from the center which features terraced almost-villas on both sides - they're small apartment buildings now. [This] (http://croatia.hr/Images/t900x600-14606/croatia_news_rijeka_001.jpg) picture shows a bit of all of these.

The post-WWII/socialist/communist period saw a lot of reconstruction and development of the city which included the building of hundreds of Soviet-style apartment buildings. However, given the uneven terrain, they are not arranged into blocs but are sprinkled haphazardly throughout. They come in tall (10-15+ stories) and short (5-6 stories max) variants with the short variant often coming in long chains of connected buildings. [This] (http://i.imgur.com/WVVt5.jpg) sort of the shows how they're tossed about.

There are also single-family homes sprinkled about, particularly in the outer suburbs. There are also lots of unfinished houses in those areas and in suburban/non-urban areas across the country. Finally, some more modern buildings have been built in the last 10-15 years but they're a very small minority.

Smaller, touristy coastal towns feature large, often bright pastel-colored houses, featuring several small apartments that are rented out to tourists during the summer. Unfortunately, they're becoming more and more gaudy, like [this] (http://www.hrvatskaapartmani.hr/EasyEdit/UserFiles/Photos/privatni-apartman-malinska-hrvatska-apartmani-malinska-otok-krk/privatni-apartman-malinska-hrvatska-apartmani-malinska-otok-krk-3_550_413.jpeg) one.",0,1376143852,null,0,1376144132,0,cbkwdfv,t3_1k2ybf,t1_cbkwdfv,t3_1k2ybf,null,1429878425,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

I went through my college for a couple of immersion programs, but I knew that they offered similar programs to nearby high schools. You could also try contacting either the nearby embassy or consulate for the country you'd like to study in. On that note, make sure to research which country you want to study in, as it will greatly impact the type of Spanish you'll learn.

From personal experience, Ecuador's Spanish is equivalent to English's Midwestern accent. They are both a bit slower and enunciated well. If you learn Ecuadorian Spanish, most people should understand you, except for some word choice. It seems like the Internet says Spain is the best place though. Either in Castilla y León or Andalusia. Personally, I think if you plan on coming back to the States, learn the Andalusian or Ecuadorian Spanish, because the accent in northern Spain is a bit ""different.""

I've never been an exchange student, but I've heard it's quite difficult but equally rewarding. However, if you can't afford the exchange program, try looking for summer work/travel programs. They may only last a month to three months, but it'll give some experience sooner than later, and will make your more competitive if you were to apply for other programs or grants (Boren Grant) or Cultural Ambassadors Program in Spain. Actually, I just got admitted into said program, but it is a job instead of an exchange program. You work as essentially a TA in a bilingual school and help the students to learn English, mostly by just talking to them. Unfortunately, they want recent college graduates, but in case you still want to in several years: http://www.mecd.gob.es/eeuu/convocatorias-programas/convocatorias-eeuu/auxiliares-conversacion-eeuu.html

You'll have a tough time if you want to stay out until after the mètro closes, but you're near the lovely Canal St Martin, Parc Buttes-Chaumont, and the metro will take you wherever you want to go during the day. The first time I ever went to Paris, I was not far away from where you'll be staying, and I had such a wonderful time in that 2 weeks that I moved to France. When I was living in Paris, I was near Mètro République and every morning I took the mètro to school, just down the sidewalk from your hostel.

They will serve you beer in plastic cups so you can sit outside along the canal and enjoy the view. When you return the cup, you get one euro back.

Another great place is [Sésame](http://www.au-sesame.com/) (51, Quai de Valmy).

Breakfast ends at 11AM. The atmosphere is lovely and the employees are very nice and welcoming. At night time it is a cool, chill bar. Free WiFi.

* A Waldkindergarten is really something special and not the norm.

* If you are extremely lucky, you can get Bayern Munich tickets for 15€, but usually it's almost impossible to get any ticket at all (because almost all places are season tickets and only a few thousand are given to the other team - so they were very lucky to get some of those). If you want a ticket it's more like upwards of 150€ from eBay.

* As a journalist he would have a hard time to get any job at all, if he wasn't doing a documentary for the BBC. He certainly wouldn't get a job at Faber Castell earning over 2000 € without any training whatsoever. (I know, it was meant to show the workplace of an ""average German"", but you might get the wrong impression that it's easy to get high paying jobs in Germany, which in fact isn't easy at all.)

A distinguished algebraist Olga Taussky-Todd described a luncheon, during which Noether, wholly engrossed in a discussion of mathematics, ""gesticulated wildly"" as she ate and ""spilled her food constantly and wiped it off from her dress, completely unperturbed"".[51] Appearance-conscious students cringed as she retrieved the handkerchief from her blouse and ignored the increasing disarray of her hair during a lecture. Two female students once approached her during a break in a two-hour class to express their concern, but they were unable to break through the energetic mathematics discussion she was having with other students.[52]

Every day in Vienna the amount of unsold bread sent back to be disposed of is enough to supply Austria’s second-largest city, Graz. Around 350,000 hectares of agricultural land, above all in Latin America, are dedicated to the cultivation of soybeans to feed Austria’s livestock while one quarter of the local population starves. Every European eats ten kilograms a year of artificially irrigated greenhouse vegetables from southern Spain, with water shortages the result.

In We Feed The World, Austrian filmmaker Erwin Wagenhofer traces the origins of the food we eat. His journey takes him to France, Spain, Romania, Switzerland, Brazil and back to Austria. Leading us through the film is an interview with Jean Ziegler, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food.

We Feed The World is a film about food and globalisation, fishermen and farmers, long-distance lorry drivers and high-powered corporate executives, the flow of goods and cash flow–a film about scarcity amid plenty. With its unforgettable images, the film provides insight into the production of our food and answers the question what world hunger has to do with us.

To help you understand I recommend watching this film. Here's a trailer:

If not doing as well as Americans in fractions is detrimental to my education then by all means, as they *need* to do it a lot and spend time learning them. Yet in a decimal system those are not that important anyway and that effort can be spent learning something else more useful.

You made a typo that makes things confusing: the cheaper fare is the *saver* fare, not safer. OP, Deutsche Bahn offers two kinds of tickets. One is flexible and doesn't tie you to a specific train, although you still have to pick dates of travel. This means it's okay if you sleep in and catch a later train than planned, or stop in a town for a few hours and then continue. The discounted fares mean you book a ticket to take one specific train. You need that take that one train, not the train that travels the same route but leaves two hours earlier. You can save a lot of money by buying these tickets, but you need to know your travel plans ahead of time since the tickets are so inflexible. (Also, the earlier you book, the cheaper they'll be. Look into getting a BahnCard 25 if you're going to travel a lot; they are 25 euro for four months or 41 [if you can get the discounted price] or 61 euros for a year and you get 25% off most tickets. Sometimes there are expections, like group tickets that let you save so much money already that they don't allow you to combine the offer with a BahnCard. MAKE SURE YOU CANCEL THE CARD AT LEAST SIX WEEKS BEFORE IT EXPIRES, or they'll automatically send you a new one and you'll get a bill for a one-year BC.)",0,1376151378,null,0,false,0,cbkyblo,t3_1k0o5t,t1_cbkyblo,t1_cbk6lto,null,1429877516,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

The [Spanish autonomous community of the Basque Country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euskadi) has, as of 2012, a population of aprox. 2.2 million (this does not include Navarre and Iparralde, which are part of the Greater Basque Country; adding those it would be more or less 3 million), then larger than other European states such as Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia, Luxembourg or Iceland, among others ( [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_population) ).

Some pro-independence parties have shown willingness to applicate to accede the European Union in the case independency is achieved. I believe there is general acceptance, and willingness, to continue being part of the EU (of couse, we would have to applicate again, we know). We are aware as well than an hypothetical application to the EU could be frustrated by a veto by Spain, France or any other country that could not have between its interests to have an independent Basque Country inside the EU, and I am talking of couse of states with separatists regions as Italy, Germany or the UK. 

We want no more rights than any other recognized sovereign state would have. When we say ""our right to decide"", we mean our right to be asked about our future, something that has been sistematically denied by the Spanish authorities.

For general critique of Finnish education system your best sources would be us educators (yeah, I am) and related studies and publications. A very good starting point would be [OPH](http://www.oph.fi/english).

Just to add:  
We never planned to have a system for 'the best education system in the world', whatever that means. We planned for *egality*, nutrition, having breaks, safe enviroment, etc... I don't know if you grasp the huge social  change that happened here, or how to explain that process and all the hard work that was done to do it, but as a poignant example: as recently as '30s poor children were sold in auctions in Finland.

We do invest quite a lot in education for good reasons. But it never was the plan to be 'the best in the world' like there was a competition about it. Honestly we were pretty much surprised how well Finland has been ranked, and to a Finn such ranking feels even a bit embarassing as it was a complete surprise.

EDIT2: There is no secret sauce into it. We've been doing well because we've been serious about it for very long time. I actually hate it when Finland gets touted as 'the best'. There's plenty to improve. And now that we're there on the top it suddenly turns into a competition to keep that position. Which is detrimental.  

I honestly hope we drop from top 10 and no-one pays us attention any more, and we can continue to do our thing in peace without ridiculous rankings like that blog post. I'm good at my job, but it does feel kinda bad when it gets internationally downplayed by ''a professor of mathematics at a Wisconsin university' who knows absolutely nothing about it with his olden genious ability of doing freaking irrelevant fractions. 

If Finland drops from top ten, then everyone else can go 'ha ha', and that's much better position - as over here we can once again concentrate on to just doing our thing instead of pointless explaining.

So please do it, World. Please drop us from top 10. We'd all be better if you did. Do it.",0,1376158433,null,0,1376167216,0,cbl0i7v,t3_1k0rlt,t1_cbl0i7v,t1_cbkyp9l,null,1429876425,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I notably want to address the question of this video basically saying immigrants can join in for Basque independence, and the mention of foreign (ie, non-Basque, non-Spanish or non-French) names like ""Omar"" and ""Mamadu"". 

What's the justification for independence if it's not on an ethnic basis? What are Basques? Are they just a language then? Considering at least the Spanish Basque country has large autonomy and all, how would independence make things gratifyingly different if an independent Basque country disregards ethnic differentiation, and joins the EU, and basically does everything the same as an autonomous region.

To me it seems in that case they just want to have their country on a map, and that's it.

I'm not trying to be rude or insulting. If Basque people want to have their own nation I'd support it. But while I understand ""right wing independent movements"" who differentiate themselves on an ethnic line, who consider they're a different people and thus should have a country, I don't get multikulti independence movements, as ultimately, the multikulti aspect kind of defeats the purpose of being a different sovereign nation/people.

true,Affelar,DENK,Denmark,"I volunteer at a Red Cross Youth Camp for underprivileged children. This summer was my third year as a helper, and I'm definitely coming back next year.

A lot of the kids at the camp come from homes where there is some sort of neglect, maybe their parents have psychological issues, or they live in poverty. This means that some of the kids don't act age-appropriate, but then again some of the other ones seem just 'normal'.

Usually you are responsible for 2-4 kids, i.e.: you send them to bed, wake them up and keep track of their clothes and so forth. This year I had a rather large kid with ADHD that went off on rampages I think 4 times in the one week the camp takes place, so there are certain challenges that are interesting to try to handle, as I have little experience in childcare. This is one of the main points of the camp as I understand it. These kids have plenty of professional adults to look after them in their daily lives, so the volunteers are just regular young adults that want to hang out with them.

I came involved through a friend who had done it before, otherwise I would have never heard about it or even considered volunteering for anything - I just hadn't crossed my mind.

And what keeps me going is the great camaraderie that exists with the other volunteers. It’s properly the only group setting I have been in through the years, that is completely drama-free. It’s also very manageable, because it only takes up one weekend in the spring and then nine days in July of your time and most expenses are paid.

I was cleaning the hornbills water bowl (used a brush) and refilling it. When I left the cage to get some water I forgot the brush.
I came back inside and the hornbill had grabbed it and ran behind a bush.

I spent 20 mins running around the bush after this hornbill until finally someone else who worked there (small crowd watching at this point), came in to block it off.

true,metroxed,EUSK,Basque Country,"The thing in Navarre is rather complex, more than what most people think. Navarre is traditionally divided into two halves; the northern one and southern one, with Pamplona in the middle. They both feel Navarrese to the core, but the northerners also feel (and are) Basque, while the southerners don't. This goes back to the times of the actual Kingdom of Navarre; Basque was spoken in the northern half and Navarro-Aragonese (later replaced by Spanish) in the southern half. If you've ever been to Navarre, you can tell the differences really quick; the architecture, etc. The linguistic policies still show this division: [map here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Navarra_-_Zonificacion_linguistica.svg). 

What does this mean? That southern Navare is not traditionally Basque, and as a result, they don't (and with every right) feel Basque. Northern Navarrese vote mostly for pro-independence parties, like Geroa Bai (Basque Nationalist Party) and EHBildu, most southerners vote for traditional Spanish parties and/or other regional parties. 

Yet, all this does not mean they're excluded; they will be welcomed if they want to be part of it, and, I believe, respected if they don't want to. ",0,1376163571,null,0,false,0,cbl22pq,t3_1k3brm,t1_cbl22pq,t1_cbl009v,null,1429875693,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Now, let's have some facts about nationalism and independentism, extracted from [this 2012-2013 survey](http://cdn.20minutos.es/adj/2013/06/05/2275.pdf) [PDF] (CIS is the main organizaction in Spain when it comes to sociological studies. Even though it's part of the central government, it's considered to be highly unbiased)

1.  Euskadi is not as nationalist as OP suggest. On a scale from 1 to 10 (1 being no nationalist at all, and 10 very nationalist), the average is just 5.41 (page 22)
2.  **48,7 of people from the Basque Autonomous community are against independence.** On the other hand, just 35.6% of the people support independence from Spain. Any other poll in the last years has shown pretty much the same numbers.
3.  By far, most people (38,6%) feel as Spaniard as Basque (page 23)

The previous data refers only to the [Basque community (Euskadi)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euskadi), which is, by very far, the most nationalist of the three regions that form the larger Basque Country (Euskal Herria), which also includes Navarre (antother Spanish region) and a part of France. Let's see how Basque Nationalism is doing in those two regions:

1. In the [last regional election in Navarre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navarrese_parliamentary_election,_2011), 65% of the people voted for non-nationalist, pro-Spain parties. The most voted party (34,5%) was UPN, strongly opposed to Basque nationalism. ***Just a mere 28,7% of the people voted for basque nationalist parties in Navarre*** (namely, NA-Bai and Bildu).
2. In the French region [(Iparralde)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iparralde) thing are even worse for Basque nationalist. From the linked wiki article:

*There is a Basque nationalist political movement, born in 1963 with the Embata mouvement (forbidden in 1974) and now with Abertzaleen Batasuna and others, which seeks a split of Pyrénées-Atlantiques into two French departments: Pays Basque and Béarn; some other nationalist parties are EAJ, EA and Batasuna which have a reduced, almost symbolic presence, especially when compared to the southern Basque Country. These political parties historically receive fewer than 15% of the vote in the district elections.*


So, in essence, contrarily to what OP suggests, the Basque Country is largely not nationalist, not even in Euskadi. Asking for the independence of two regions where nationalist parties get less than 30% and 15% of the votes is just insane and ridiculous. Even in Euskadi, where people oppose secession by a large margin, this whole thing is anything but crazy.",0,1376164410,null,0,1376164610,0,cbl2bkf,t3_1k3brm,t1_cbl2bkf,t3_1k3brm,null,1429875578,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

The UK voting system is based on ""[first-past-the-post](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting)"", so the actual number of people voting for a party only has a rough correlation with the number of MPs that they get.

I suspect if the UK elections used something more akin to proportional representation (as per Scottish elections, which use [AMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additional_Member_System)) then people would not feel quite so disconnected. I don't think the problem is not being able to sway the result (sometimes you win, sometimes you lose), it's more that you feel that your vote was disproportionally under-represented.

It has a VERY debated history that follows the last 20 years of Italian history, and a quite complex situation, because being levied at town-level it differs from town to town.

The tax (ICI, imposta comunale sugli immobili) was intreoduced in the nineties, in order to give to the ""comuni"" (municipalities) some authonomy (i.e. they could decide how much tax to ask, and how to spend it)

The tax is quite un-popular with Italians, and has often been subject of electoral propaganda, like in the 2006 campaign, when on a televised debate in the last date before the elections, Berlusconi promised removing the tax if he won (he didn't).

The debate went on, in 2011 the tax was replaced by a Berlusconi government with another tax, (IMU, imposta municipale unica), without substantially changing the matter.

During the 2013 campaign Berlusconi again promised removing the tax (he went further, promising he would give back what Italians had already paid).

Now we have a left-right coalition, with Berlusconi's party in the goverment.

Berlusconi has just been sentenced to a 4-years sentence for tax dodging that will also makes him not electable. This is very dangerous for him (if he is not an MP, many other trials against him will be revived).

Basically his party is saying ""Berlusconi's sentence must be somehow blocked, or we'll withdraw from the goverment"". Berlusconi seems to be preparing for a new campaign, and once again (in these very last days) says that IMU must be paid back to Italians.

We have two separate words for them: ""Russkiy"" and ""Rossiyanin"". The Bolsheviks also heavily promoted Judaism as a separate ethnicity, encouraging Jews to speak Yiddish and even tried to create an Israel-like ""homeland"" (in Siberia. LOL) for them. See Jewish Autonomous Oblast. Any way, most of Lenin's closest associates, like Trotsky, Kamenev and Zinoviev (all pseudonyms) were Jews from all over the Russian Empire. The ""father"" of the Soviet secret police, the CheKa (later NKVD, later KGB) was a Polish Jew named ""Iron"" Felix Dzerzhinsky. His giant statue in front of the KGB headquarters was toppled by the restive Russian people in 1991, following the hard-liner/KGB coup attempt. 

Stalin (nee Dzhugashvilli) was as Georgian as they come. He spoke Russian with a thick accent and had a disdain for vodka, preferring Georgian wine and Armenian cognac. Make no mistake, Georgians are extremely culturally different from Russians - their language is about as discernible as Chinese and despite (mostly) being fellow Orthodox Christians, their culture is a lot more traditionalist and well... ""Asiatic"". When Hitler spoke about the ""Asiatic cruelty"" of the Bolshevik regime, he was partially right. 

As far as nostalgia/administration for Stalin... I visited Georgia just before the Collapse of the USSR. By then, we all knew that Stalin was a giant asshole - even worse than what Khrushchev made him out to be. This is why I was blown away by the fact that, every rural Georgian home that I visited, had a big portrait of Stalin hanging in the main room. As far as I know, the only remaining major statue of Stalin still standing anywhere in the former USSR, is located in the main square of Stalin's home town of Gori, Georgia. I know a guy who was part of the Russian contingent which briefly occupied Gori in 2008. Him and most other guys really wanted to blow that statue up, but received strict orders not to do anything to it, in order to prevent further antagonizing the locals. By far, the biggest modern Stalinist that I personally knew, was a pure-bred Ukrainian. So, this phenomena is not just restricted to elderly Russians. Also, the whole thing can partially be attributed to a form of the ""Stockholm Syndrome"", where a victim/hostage begins to develop feelings of strong empathy and admiration for their oppressor/brutalizer. 

As far as Russian opposition, how am I wrong?!? One just has to look at pictures of any major Russian opposition rally and see the red Communist and National Bolshevik flags everywhere in the crowd. Explain that. 

Russia is like this big, drunk, ragged old bear. It almost looks cute and comically weak just sitting there on his ass, propped up against a tree. It will let you get close, stare and laugh, poke it and even hit it with a stick a few times. But, it's still a bear. You push it far enough, it will sober up, get off his ass and tear you to pieces.

False. Look pregunta 38:
""Pregunta 38 
Y en concreto, ¿estaría Ud. totalmente a favor, más bien a favor, más bien en contra o totalmente en contra de que el País Vasco fuera independiente?""

That's not identity - that's ""would you support/oppose independence?"". And the answer to that question is that 48% of the people oppose it, while only 38% support it.

&gt;more than 50% of the population voted in the last elections for one pro-independence party, either the more moderate Basque Nationalist Party or EH Bildu.

That's true, but you omit a few details:

1. Only a fraction of those who vote for PNV actually support independence. A large part of their voters just has some special love for Euskadi, and would probably be in favor of more autonomy (Plan Ibarretxe, for example). But being in favor of an independent country, that's another story.
2. Nationalist parties had a very slight majority because bothe PP and PSOE (the two main pro-Spain parties) have been losing a shitload of votes because of the crisis (not only in Euskadi, but everywhre else).
3. When you talk about independence, you include Iparralde and Navarre, which, as you know and i just proved in my previous post, could hardly care less about it. You abertzales like to talk a lot about democracy, but it's kinda hilarious that you want to annex two regions where 70 and 85% of the people oppose said annexation. For some reason, you are completely blind to both 30 years of Navarre voting for the Spanish, anti-nationalist right wing and the very poor results (10%) in Iparralde. Every time I see a map of Euskal Herria, I can't help but laugh a bit.

Polls -including the most recent Euskobarometros- clearly indicate that, unlike in Catalonia, most people oppose independence. Now, if those polls were to include Iparralde and navarre, the results would be simply hilarious.

Oh, and for what is worth, I'm not a ""facha"". In fact, I support nationalist movement in Catalonia. The difference is that there the majority of the people support independence by a pretty large margin.

true,TheEndgame,NORW,Norway,"I can start off by saying that despite what people think there are some problems in Norway aswell. These problems are more about how public services are run. Since there is an election in one month (9. Sept) these are the things the parties want to fix:

- Infrastructure: The infrastructure in Norway is in need of a serious upgrade. There has been a few reports that have stated that we will have to use around 77 billion Euros to get the roads to a decent european standard. Sweden is building 8 times more road than us every year, and that without road tolls. In Norway new projects, which there has been more of, are mostly financed using road tolls. Railways are also something which we need to build more of. Right now it is the ""intercity triangle"" which is the most debated when it comes to rail. This is a ""triangle"" of railroads that run from Oslo to Skien, Lillehammer and Halden. They are planning to build double tracks on all of these streches, but it will take 10 years to complete. This is a major discussion, how long it takes to build things. Mostly because of bureaucrats wanting a say in everything.

- Health: There is a problem in Norway with long waiting lists for patients. Some parties want to buy services from private hospitals to get rid of the queues. There are also big problems with bureaucrats in the health sector. The doctors say they use more time on papers than on operating patients.

- Dependancy on oil and the country turning uncompetative: Because of the oil, our wages have gone skyrocketing. At the same time the taxes and other charges have increased, which creates a spiral of increasing costs. Norwegian wages are 60% over the European average and this causes problems for sectors that aren't connected to the oil and gas sector.

- EU/EEA and agriculture: There is of course some people that want out of the EEA. At the same time the two largest parties want to join the EU. Even though that is the case, most people want to keep it the way it is now. Even though that means we get no vote in the EU parlament and have to pay the same prize as EU countries while not getting the full benefits. Agriculture is also a popular topic. The ruling coalition government has the Centre Party (farmers party) in it. This party is not very fond of the EU and is very protectionistic. They are the ones who added the 400% toll on imported cheese and other agriculture products. Each year we use 2,5 billion Euroes to subsidize agriculture which isnt profitable at all. The cost goes to the consumers, which have to pay the highest food prizes in Europe, and has the least amount of products in our stores. If you are not in the city you only have 1 (!) brand of milk, which comes from the farmers cooperative. In the cities you may get two brands.

- Immigration: This is one of the hottest topics in our debate climate. There is some resistance from the EU opposers which say that workers from the EU are ""stealing"" jobs from our youth and pressing the wages down. The construction sector is now containing mostly eastern european workers. Some people question the qualifications these workers have and if they get payed a proper wage. We also have the typical asylum debate. A recent hot topic was about asylum seekers kids which have to leave the country even if they spoke Norwegian and were integrated into the society. In most of the families that get sent out the parents have given wrong information to the authorities when it comes to their identity. This is also related to how long it takes to get an answer on the asylum application. In other words, bureaucrats. There has also been a Roma/gypsy debate of what we should do to the ones who come here to beg. Some people want to try and help them while some people know it doesn't work and want to get them out of here so we can rather help them where they come from.

- Environment and drilling for oil outside the Lofoten islands: The three largest parties want to drill for oil outside the Lofoten islands. Many people are very concerned about what will happen to the environment in this area as it is a very large fishing area. Many people fear a large oil spill. On the other end people want the oil age to last for a long time and think this is a golden opportunity for the northern parts of the country to bloom. This is a region which have suffered a large population decrease as the young people want to move to the cities. 

Wow, that turned out to be a long text!

They had a colonial empire before WW1, so it doesn't make sense to say a lack of colonial empire was the reason they tried to conquer Europe in WW1. It was only disassembled because France really just wanted to curbstomp Germany into ruin. Which meant fascism could take over the most powerful European nation.

I have an explanation for that and it doesn't include any kind of malice from the Catalan speaking side. 

Consider this, you grow up in a place where everybody you have ever met, regardless the language they speak at home, speaks/understands Catalan and Spanish. Everyone has their preferred language, that causes that bilingual conversations are a very common thing (with people speaking in one language and getting answers in the other). 

Someone asks me something in Spanish, and I answer in Catalan (because it's easier and more natural for me). That's normal. The opposite also happens. 

For me, the strange thing is finding someone who speaks Spanish and doesn't know a word of Catalan. It's something ingrained in my brain, if he/she speaks Spanish,  he/she also understands Catalan.

Not that it matters, because Bavaria is big and conservative. The CSU exceeds the 5% limit quite handily on Bavarian votes alone.

You abertzales like to talk a lot about democracy, but it's kinda hilarious that you want to annex two regions where 70 and 85% of the people oppose said annexation. For some reason, you are completely blind to both 30 years of Navarre voting for the Spanish, anti-nationalist right wing and the very poor results (10%) in Iparralde. Every time I see a map of Euskal Herria, I can't help but laugh a bit.

I get what you're saying. Let me start by saying that I'm not actually an abertzale. You use the word ""annexation"", a word I would not use, at least not when referring to Iparralde; they're the Basque Country too; I would use the word ""unite"", better. About Navarre... well, I'm pretty aware that an important amount of their population does not feel Basque (and would be delusional for my part to say they do), but northern Navarre does. They even use the ikurriña in their squares and town halls, despite it getting forbidden (thanks to UPN!). I don't like using historical justifications for things, but let's remember that the Vascones (the predecessors of the modern Basques) were native of central Navarre, as well as the Basque language. 

I'm aware as well that an hypothetical independence would not include the *whole* Euskal Herria (Euskadi + Navarre or northern Navarre + Iparralde), at least not at the beginning; most likely it would only be Euskadi. But as I say, I am confident it would be only the beginning, just the first step. Time will tell, really. The French Basques might not be really interested as for now, but they are actually (and have been for years now) asking the French central government for more autonomy; they want their own department (currently they're part of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques). It is something that has been denied, now and with previous governments as well, but it *is* the start of something. 

&gt;PS: Nice to see an intelligent, passionate Basque in reddit, even if we certainly don't agree on this little conflict of ours ;)

true,hotbowlofsoup,NETH,The Netherlands,"It all depends on what your definition of lovely is.

To us, houses from before the 1920's seem cute and are like little doll houses. But to the people living in them in those days they were cramped, filthy, unhealthy, dark and shabby.

So when they came up with stuff[ like this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Onderlangs_Betondorp_Amsterdam_5.jpg/800px-Onderlangs_Betondorp_Amsterdam_5.jpg) in the 1920's. Comfortable, spacious, green, light, affordable housing, it seemed like a blessing to them. 

People always wonder how old buildings from before the war got demolished over the years. But they forget the living conditions in those houses, before the 1980's, were below par.

Then when the car became affordable in later decades, the old cities of the Netherlands, not build for cars at all, seemed even more hopelessly obsolete.
In the seventies still, people were glad to get out of the cramped old houses and streets of Amsterdam, into the new,  houses of Almere and the [Bijlmermeer](http://www.pieterboersmaphotography.com/archief/bijlmer/slides/Hogevecht%20%20Bijlmermeer%2002-1971.1981-10.jpg).

The [population of Amsterdam](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/nl/timeline/f5aa586d25539e186985dfaaea529e92.png) went from 870,000 in 1963 to 680,00 in 1984. Amsterdam still hasn't recovered from that. That's why there were plans in the 1960's to turn the canals into motorways. In Utrecht they even started with a similar ridiculous plan (which they're now trying to turn back).

I guess I digress. But it shows how places like Almere and the sorts didn't come out of nowhere. The old housing, we now think of as charming, just didn't work either in those days.

We lost the war, had to pay war retalations to the Soviets, find room for all the people evacuated from Karelia and do this all while the Soviets were keeping a close eye on us. There was a shortage of many essential building materials. Personally I think the 50's house you see in the picture looks quite nice in real, maybe the grey colorscale makes it look more harsh in the picture. Unlike the Swedes in top post, I tried to find realistic depictions of different building types around Helsinki area. They have been of course renovated quite many times and the insides are usually quite modern.

Urbanization hit hard in the 60's and most people in cities live in these fast build ""neighbourhood units"" (lähiö). They usually look nicer than the one in picture. In countryside builings are bigger detached houses with own yard. But it's hard to think typical Finnish building as they vary quite much, you can use Google's street view to have a own look.

One thing that doesn't actually work that well in Finland and in Helsinki especially is the real estate market. Finns pay more for less. There is a shortage of affordable housing.
