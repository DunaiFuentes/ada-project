It's well known that the American society is far more pro-capitalist than people in Europe and there's the two-party system, so the Democratic party has to pander to the mainstream voters, who on average are more tolerant of capitalism. But if we take the more radical folks who congregate on reddit or in the Occupy movement, or they're university professors, they're the ones who are very intollerant of capitalism and at the same time they're promoting ""diversity"" and all the Neo-Marxist bullshit.

Your notion of ""oppression"" is also completely wrong and twisted. I don't understand what's wrong about rounding up Latinos, because they're more likely to commit crimes or to be illegal immigrants, so it's natural they should be subject to more scrutiny. The same goes for the ""stop an frisk"" program in NY, where people like you are constantly whining how ""racist"" it is.  

And homosexuals have more rights in the US than in most European countries, it's just a complete nonsense to say that they're being oppressed.

He was also a war hero who led the grassroots anti-fascist resistance movement that drove out occupying forces with minimal outside help. He was an icon (fueled by propaganda, of course, but there was truth behind it) and he was lauded by a large part of the public.

There's also the matter of Yugoslavia's decline and eventual dissolution coinciding with his death. Many feel that the successor states have failed to provide the same prosperity and security that they enjoyed during Yugoslavia.

Finally, as an aside, I wouldn't really call the regime communist, but rather one based on [socialist self-management] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_self-management#Europe).

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;However, many would argue that there should be an asterisk added to it. Tito cannot be mentioned in the same sentence with the likes of Hitler, Stalin, Ceausescu, Pinochet, Pol Pot, etc.

Well, he murderded thousands, and oppressed millions. That he was better a  murdered less than his contemporaries, does not make him a good guy. Also, that he only murded in the beginning (mostly) is because afterwards there were not that many more, and he had already shown what would happen. So, really, it does not make him a good guy, or an honorable guy. He did not allow to much opposition, not at all. 

&gt;e relative prosperity, freedom, and quality of life (that approached some western European figures) that followed.

Of the Eastern countries DDR had it best. One do no see them honoring Honecker, who had far, far less killed than Tito. Don't you think it would be weird giving Mrs Honecker a state funeral, generally reserved for Adenauer and people like him?

B) Besides, if I understand the economic side of it he took a lot of loans Yugoslavia in no way could afford and thus laid the groundwork for later economic problems later on. Had he lived he would have had to face them too. Why would anyone honour that? 


&gt;Finally, as an aside, I wouldn't really call the regime communist, but rather one based on socialist self-management. Certain communist figures were respected, but the system was quite different from what was practiced in the Warsaw Pact nations.

OK, I'll stop calling him that, thanks. But what did he call himself? 


&gt;Serbia, as the legal successor, is honoring the widow of a former head of state (who is not vilified to the extent of the above mentioned dictators).


But a former head of state *that was a dictator who had thousands killed and millions oppressed*. He oppressed anyone who wanted an independent Croatia etc (and didn't he punish them for Ustasja or however it is spelled) and thus laid the groundwork for the war that followed, really. 

I mean, I can understand that one can leave the woman alone, but frankly, what Serbia is doing is giving the highest honour they can to a man who was a dictator, laid the groundworks for both a civil war and a bad economy and had thousands killed (or is it hundreds of thousands with all the ethnic Germans). I mean, he is part of the Serbian history, and he was by all accounts a very interesting man, but one should not  overlook the things I just mentioned, at least I don't think so.

Theoretically in the last elections the UK Labour Party could have formed such a coalition with Parties such as the Greens and the SNP as well as the Lib Dems, but for various reasons - including acknowledgement that the UK general public is used to a first past the post winner takes all system - and a fear of giving small parties too much influence in Westminster they abandoned coalition talks.

* It's not just the additive chemicals in the fracking fluid, but also the contamination which the fluid picks up by being pumped through what is basically an oil field. Usually the fluid is so contaminated by the time it reaches the surface, it can't be treated using conventional waste treatment methods. In the US they often leave these fluids in plastic-lined open air ponds, and wait for them to evaporate.

* Preventing fracking fluids from contaminating the ground-water relies on the integrity of the well-casing, which is not necessarily assured.

* Fracking requires the use of enormous amounts of water, which have to be taken from local resources, or shipped in.

* A lot of the original fracking projects vented to air after the initial rush of gas had been recovered. That meant that people in the general area were exposed to a lot of nasties from the site, basically a random mix of volatile organic chemicals, which aren't great for health.

* Fracking requires many well casings to be drilled to fully exploit a shale bed, which means a high burden of general development. In UK parlance, that means turning green-field into brown-field sites.

* I'm not so bothered about seismic problems, but there's that.

* In terms of GHG, the benefits/drawbacks are heavily disputed. Some studies say that the process releases enough methane to cancel out the benefits of burning natural gas over coal.

Tito was far more than just a dictator. He was a very important person for our history. He did a lot of bad things but he did a lot of good things too. If it weren't for him we would have fallen under the Soviets.If it weren't for him we would not have been able to travel abroad (including Western Europe and the US), to watch foreign media. Believe it or not even communism had its good sides (gasp). Most older people feal life was better back then. We had better standards of living than all our neighbors (Romania, Hungary etc...). Not the case today. He was an important symbol of Yugoslavia for a long time and what it meant. I don't see how you don't understand these things. And it's not just Serbia that respects him. There were normal common people that traveled en mass to Jovanka's funeral from Macedonia to Slovenia.

true,DeepSeaDweller,CROA,Croatia,"&gt;Well, he murderded thousands, and oppressed millions. That he was better a murdered less than his contemporaries, does not make him a good guy.

Well, many of the killings took place in the form of summary executions of axis soldiers and collaborators and were carried in the immediate aftermath of their capture. They were done with the intent of payback for the crimes they committed as well as to prevent them from remaining active in the postwar period and posing a threat to the new state. The Ustaše leadership of the war-time fascist puppet Independent State of Croatia started out as an underground organization that carried out terrorist attacks (most notably the [assassination of King Alexander in Marseille] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Yugoslavia#Assassination) during the interwar period and it's not a stretch to believe they would have resumed such activities. Unfortunately, many innocents were caught in this dragnet and perished. Detentions began in 1948 when Yugoslavia split from the Soviet-dominated eastern bloc and were carried out against anybody that demonstrated signs of sympathizing with the Soviet Union.

&gt;Also, that he only murded in the beginning (mostly) is because afterwards there were not that many more, and he had already shown what would happen.

The killings took place predominantly during the lawlessness of the end of WWII.

&gt;So, really, it does not make him a good guy, or an honorable guy. He did not allow to much opposition, not at all.

No, but given what we know now, who came out of WWII in a good and honorable light? The Soviets raped and pillaged eastern Europe, the western allies bombed parts of Germany and Japan into the stone age.

&gt;Of the Eastern countries DDR had it best. One do no see them honoring Honecker, who had far, far less killed than Tito. Don't you think it would be weird giving Mrs Honecker a state funeral, generally reserved for Adenauer and people like him?

The DDR had the most pervasive secret police force the world has ever seen. There were absolutely no freedoms, no freedom of movement, and their access to consumer goods was severely restricted and limited. The DDR went from flying high during the later interwar period and first half of the war to being destroyed and dominated by the Soviets in the following decades.

&gt;B) Besides, if I understand the economic side of it he took a lot of loans Yugoslavia in no way could afford and thus laid the groundwork for later economic problems later on. Had he lived he would have had to face them too. Why would anyone honour that?

Yes, Yugoslavia's economy was heavily dependent on foreign loans and had difficulties in repaying them. I believe they took loans to pay loans. At any rate, Yugoslavia was in a position in which they could get loans based on their geopolitical position in the Cold War. Also, like I said, the average citizen didn't really feel the strain of this too often. People had jobs and could put food on the table and splurge on luxuries every so often.

&gt;OK, I'll stop calling him that, thanks. But what did he call himself?

I believe it was worker's self-management (*radničko samoupravljanje*).

&gt;He oppressed anyone who wanted an independent Croatia etc (and didn't he punish them for Ustasja or however it is spelled)

The only case where an area was punished was, I believe, western Herzegovina and the Dalmatian hinterland. These areas were largely ignored during development and to this day remain relatively underdeveloped. Then again, these areas are also very difficult climate and landscape-wise. This area (they are next to each other) produced a large number of Ustaša members and leaders and were (correctly, IMO) perceived as harboring/sharing the same sentiments that the movement espoused.

Yugoslav authorities suppressed all nationalist movements. Well, except for the Serbian nationalism that Milošević used to gain a dominant share of power within the federal leadership in the late 80's that eventually led to its demise.",0,1382831514,null,0,false,0,cd0b061,t3_1p90b4,t1_cd0b061,t1_cd0a3r7,null,1428972412,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4
true,Reilly616,EURO,European Union,"I appreciate the effort, but that didn't help at all I'm afraid. Luxembourg uses a system of informateur/formateur to negotiate governing coalitions, like Belgium for example. The formateur who is appointed to find a coalition capable of forming a majority (and successfully does so) will usually become PM (see di Rupo in Belgium). 

In Luxembourg, CSV won 23 seats, LSAP won 13, DP 13, the Greens 6, ADR 3, and the Left 2 (60 seats in total).

So, CSV are the obvious choice to form the Government, and normally Junker would be the formateur, then the PM. *But* LSAP, DP, and the Greens want to form a coalition without CSV (and CSV cannot reach a majority without at least one of them), so a formateur has been appointed from within those three parties to chair the negotiations (and probably become PM at the end of them). All fine so far.

My question is simply this: Why was the leader of DP appointed formateur rather than the leader of LSAP? LSAP received more votes than DP in the election. Of the three, one would imagine that LSAP would be the lead party in the coalition - only marginally of course, since they won the same number of seats, but marginally would still give them the PM (and logically the role of formateur in the negotiations). If the most popular party (CSV) is not in the coalition, then the second most popular party (LSAP) should surely be given first dibs on the post of PM (unless and until this becomes a sticking point during negotiations).",0,1382831542,null,0,1382831768,0,cd0b0hu,t3_1p9neo,t1_cd0b0hu,t1_cd0a4vf,null,1428972408,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

What about your neighbours Austria etc? DDR btw had better standards then you.

He took a lot of loans that you couldn't afford that messed up your economy afterwards. He also oppressed stuff like croatian independence, had mass deportations and thus laid the groundworks for the collapse.

You are an idiot. He has no power. We *do* elect our prime minister, but you must honestly be so stupid that you think we are a dictatorship under a king.

&gt; You won't listen.

I am. What the Serbs  are saying is that since Tito was less of a dictator than Stalin and his ilkes, he is not really a bad dictator, since he only had thousands murderd, not million. Also, he oppressed people but less than in *some* other dictatorships. Also, Yugoslavia was not as poor as Romania and Hungary, so he deserves to be honoured. You ignore the loans he took, and the thousands murders, the peopel deported and the oppression, since there are worse people around (which is true). With that reasoning Gadaffi was a cool guy, and Castro is a top notch dude.

#1 will inmediately identify you as a foreigner, as (at least in spain) we never say ""estoy caliente"" when refering to horny. We would say ""estoy cachondo"" or some other of the many mor subtle ways of saying the same thing.

#2: [There's even a song about the many names spanish masculinity has.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSLTnbvFy3g) (lyrics in video description)

#3: This is kinda funny because there's very few ways you can say ""I'm gonna run"" making sure nobody can make the pun. Still, ""voy a correrme"" does not mean ""I'm gonna run"" under any circumstances. And ""Me voy a correr"" can be said confortably in both contexts, the same way you can say ""I'm coming"".

#4 is a typical primary school joke.

#5 In spanish, ""coño"" means the, er, organ. It's not an adjective, it's a noun. So, yeah, you're asking for something to fuck with in the worst and most ackward way possible. The correspondent adjective would be ""coñazo"", and it's not nearly as offensive and not used in the same contexts as in english.

#7 Is specially funny, because when we swear, the most common way to start is ""me cago en..."". I don't think there's a good way to translate it, but when a spaniard is (very) upset, he will likely say one of the following:
* Me cago en todo (very general) ""I shit in everything""
* Me cago en dios (for atheists only, very general) ""I shit in god""
* Me cago en todo lo que se menea (a valid substitute to ...en todo) ""I shit in everything that moves""
* Me cago en ti (not as used as the following) ""I shit in you""
* Me cago en tu padre/madre (commonly used among friends) ""I shit in your father/mother""

You can combine them all:

* Me cago en dios, en ti, en tus muertos, en tu padre, y en la puta madre que te parió. ""I shit in god, in you, in your dead (read: your dead relatives), in your father and in your whore who gave birth to you"". This is truly offensive.

true,Raevinn,NETH,The Netherlands,"Nice video, guess it was pretty bad back then for some reason but honestly... everyone i talk to thinks what's happening today is disgraceful. 

I had to pay 2200 euro's for my driver's license (car) and 1400 euro's for my motorcycle license. My mother had to pay 50 guldens (25 euro's) for her motorcycle license and 120 guldens (~60 euro's) for her car license. They where allowed to practice on the road without anyone watching or giving a damn (hello accidents) and had a pathetic exam where all you had to do was show that you knew how to control your vehicle.

I currently pay 103 euro's a month for owning a car (road tax) and regular gas is 1,73 euro's a liter. These prices are going up in 2014. 

Cars that are older are currently free from road tax because hardly anyone drives one and those that do tend to own a ""classic"" because they have a special love for them and own a modern car on the side. This is being cancelled in 2014 and cars now have to be 40 years or older and are banned from use in December, January and February in order to get a ""road tax cut"" where you have to pay 102 euro's a year for owning one.

Car sales where low because we have a ridiculous and illegal tax called ""BPM"" which put a tax depending on how much co2 a car emits which makes a car several thousands of euro's more expensive than any other country in the world. To advance the sales of motor vehicles the government said that cars that don't emit much get a road tax and bpm tax break thus people got interested and started spending money. Our current government promised it wouldn't use the car as a ""cow to milk"". Politicians being politicians, they lied. They are now, also, making everyone that bought one of these cars pay full price. Seeing as these ""hybrid"" and ""electric"" cars weigh quite a bit and our road taxes are based on a car's weight, it's a good amount of money they will have to pay thus people are desperate to get rid of them but hardly anyone's biting.

So, in most cases it's foolish to think most of us ""enjoy"" cycling when most of us really just grab a bicycle because it's cheaper and both owning a car and public transportation is something a lot of people can't afford anymore.

-The plaza St Jaume, where the generalitat is, is roughly located in the same place where the center of the Roman city of Barcelo was.

-Santa Eulalia is the patron saint of Barcelona (this is well known). The gothic cathedral (the big one) is dedicated to her (this is more or less known). The cathedral has an small area where plants and 13 white geese are kept, one for every torture Eulalia went trough in the hands of romans (this is not well known in my experience).

-Park Guell was original meant to be a housing district for the wealthy. It was re-purposed as a park.

-The Barcelona - Real Madrid rivalry has a very interest historical origin linked with the civil war. Many people saw the Barcelona team a strong representation of the Catalan people who were one of the biggest opposer to Franco and saw Madrid as a symbol as Franco's central government. Anyone who has gone to a game knows it is still a vent to the many catalan - madrid political conflicts.

-Some people point to a young Gaudi as a the designer for the piping system for the fountain in the Parc de la Ciutadella.

-This one is well known by many, but the Barceloneta's sand is not natural. It is brought from somewhere else (if anyone knows where please do tell).

true,almodozo,null,null,"From what I understand -- but I'm an outsider! Any Czechs reading along, please do tell me where you think I'm wrong! -- there are roughly three groups of people shoring up communist support, though these three obviously overlap in various ways. 

From the *least* important to the *most* important, I would guess:

3) Previously apolitical young people and poor or working class people who have become disgruntled with the excesses and dysfunctionalities of postcommunist capitalism.

2) Protest voters who have become disillusioned and angry about the pervasive corruption of the mainstream parties of both left and right. The communists were never allowed in national government since 1989, and one upside in that is that they've never gotten dirty hands in all the privatization and corruption scandals, so they're seen as 'clean'. Since these elections emerge from particularly deep corruption scandals, that's a powerful card.

1) Pensioners and other mostly old people who are nostalgic for the old communist system. 

The last group, from what I understand, actually does still form the bedrock of the party, which is reflected in the party's very stable support throughout the postcommunist period, especially in comparison with the seesaw of other parties. (The party's vote in national elections has never dropped below 10% or surpassed 20%).

If such strong nostalgia for the former totalitarian system seems strange, especially considering that the Czech communists were the only ones in the region not to change their name and not to transform their ideology into a kind of mishmash of (neo)liberalism and social-democracy, it should be kept in mind that: 

(a) some degree of nostalgia for the old days of guaranteed employment etc among a substantial minority of the population is common enough across even Central Europe (not even talking about the former Soviet Union). This is reflected both in the results of ex-communist parties, which outside the Czech Republic may have changed their names and ideologies but can still rely on this kind of nostalgia too, and in opinion polls from over these two+ decades that have explicitly asked for opinions about the old vs the new system.

(b) historically, the Czech lands were the only part of Central Europe, along with Eastern Germany, where communism truly was strong before WW2 and especially directly after WW2. Before the war, the communist party consistently got 10% of the vote in Czechoslovakia, and this vote was overwhelmingly concentrated in the Czech part of the country. After the war, there were actually still mostly free elections in 1947, and the Communists became the largest party of Czechoslovakia in those elections, with some 30% of the vote (and more than that in the Czech parts). 

Compare that with Hungary, which also still had largely free elections after the war, but where the communists got stuck at just 17% (arguably encouraging the Stalinists to clamp down a lot harder than they did in Czechoslovakia). And even that was relatively strong compared with Poland and Romania - in Romania, the communists had all of 1,000 members coming out of WW2 and was soon thrust into a position of dictatorial control without much of any cadre or popular constituency (which perhaps makes it unsurprising that it developed the most violent dictatorship of the whole region),

So, considering the surprising endurance of geographical political traditions even across decades and profound systemic changes, that might also play a role.

It's not just old people though, for sure. Already back in the late-90s I met a Czech girl who had been just 12 or so in 1989, and to my great surprise turned out to be an ardent communist. She sincerely argued things like how Vaclav Havel had only been stopped from publishing in communist Czechoslovakia because he was just a really bad writer. :-/",0,1382845000,null,0,1382845461,0,cd0f8ce,t3_1p93pj,t1_cd0f8ce,t1_cd05c4a,null,1428970411,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

The social-democrats don't have a majority, not with communist supporrt either.

Babis has said he doesn't want his ANO to govern with the social-democrats.

If we take him on his word, the only social-democratic-led government would have to be one with support from not just the communists, but also Okamura's *Dawn* party AND the Christian-Democrats. That sounds ... unrealistic, no? To put it lightly?

If he's bluffing to get a better negotiation position, how is an CSSD/ANO coalition supposed to work? Could it work?

As an outsider looking in and just looking at the numbers, a new center-right government actually suddenly looks a lot more feasible. ANO + TOP + ODS + Christian Democrats = 103 seats. And if either the ODS, licking its wounds, or the Christian Democrats would refuse to join, they could govern with Dawn instead - even if that's presumably a risky venture in the mid/long term.

Am I missing something, though? I haven't been following too closely. Would TOP consider itself above governing with Babis?

Second question: how will Milos Zeman's influence be impacted by these results? On the one hand, his pet party, SPOZ, crashed and burnt, with just 1.5%, even though he pesonally featured on their posters and everything.

Qu'est ce qu'on considère comme enfant non autonome ? J'entends par là qu'effectivement, on peut considérer que jusqu'à la majorité, un enfant n'est pas autonome. On peut éventuellement étendre cela jusqu'à la fin des études. Ou l'obtention d'un premier emploi ? La question n'est pas si évidente que cela.

Ceci étant, je suis partagé. Je pense qu'il est nécessaire de garder une petite part d'héritage. L'imposition actuelle considère un abattement jusqu'à 100 000 euros, suivi de taux progressifs. On pourrait tout à fait relever fortement ses taux voire très fortement pour ces tranches.

Ceci étant, le problème est de savoir comment le gouvernement va gérer cette fabuleuse rentrée de patrimoine notamment immobilier au regard du coût de celui-ci. Remise sur le marché au prix du marché ? Avec un prix plus proche de la réalité, pour autant qu'on puisse définir une ""réalité"" du prix du marché. Remise en location dans un cadre HLM ou consorts ?
Et quel impact cela a sur les propriétaires actuels qui se sont endettés au prix du marché ? Je ne parle pas ici des propriétaires d'immeubles entiers, mais de ceux qui possèdent juste leur appartement, leur maison ou éventuellement une résidence secondaire.

Et cela nécessiterait de reformer le droit des entreprises. En effet, une entreprise est considérée comme une personne morale, à la différence près qu'elle n'est pas susceptible de déceder. Dans quelle mesure ne risque-t-on pas que ces biens remis sur le marché à un prix modéré ne soient pas rachetées par des entreprises qui maintiendront de fait un prix de l'offre élevé ?

Dans quelle mesure cela ne risque-t-il pas de créer une nouvelle crise ? Bien que nous n'en soyons pas vraiment à une de plus. Cela fait 40 ans qu'on va de crise en crise ;)",0,1382849365,null,0,false,0,cd0gifj,t3_1p4gsb,t1_cd0gifj,t1_cd00gw8,null,1428969814,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"Culturally, Kazakhstan is certainly not European.  Traditional Kazakhs (not Russians, Germans, Greeks, etc who were moved there during WWII) are steppe people, much like the Mongolians, and their customs are more closely aligned with that culture than that of, say, Germany or France, or even Russia to a certain extent (this is excluding the shared Soviet culture, of course).  This also holds linguistically; Kazakh is very similar to Turkish, and speakers of both languages can understand each other with relative ease.  One thing to note, though -- Kazakh was not a written language for quite some time.  

One more thing about culture -- Kazakhstan was incredibly diverse since Soviet times, when displaced immigrants started to come in after the war.  Thus, you had a number of Russians, Germans, Greeks, and others living together in one country.  A large majority have since left, but small segments remain.  Meanwhile, the number of Chinese and Korean immigrants has grown and there are a number of Indian students going there for university.

The country didn't truly begin to industrialize until WWII, when the entertainment and other industries were moved there to keep them going during the war.  Add to that the fact that KZ is a large country with a small population, and you have a perfect desert wasteland to test nuclear and aerospace products, thus helping grow those industries, too.  Kazakhstan also has prime natural resources -- if it's on a periodic table, it most likely can be found in Kazakhstan.  At one point, Kazakhstan was also known for its apple -- in fact, the name of the former capital, Almaty, means ""father apple"" in Kazakh.

Note, though, that this industrialization had a number of health effects on the people, some more noticeable than others.  The air in the majors cities isn't particularly clean, and the climate is dry.  Other health issues also persist, especially thyroid issues (in both men and women), and stem from various sources: salt, for example, wasn't iodized until 1999 (iodine deficiencies affect thyroids).  I'm not an expert on health issues by any means, so this is what I know so far.

The country itself is slowly modernizing.  The capital was moved from Almaty, near the China border, to Astana (closer to Europe).  A curious fact about Astana: it was not designed by architects, but by current president Narsultan Nazarbayev, who has been in charge since the last days of the Soviet Union.  Almaty finally created a long awaited Metro system, and has been building infrastructure quickly -- it's a completely different country now, physically, than 20 years ago.

I said I would take ownership but of the three lawyers spoken to they all said this is not possible as the liability is with the service holder.

In the end we went with a lawyer who drafted a new letter which was signed by her mum and then sent with the lawyers letter saying they aren't getting any money.

I paid the €250 lawyers bill.

&gt; Guarda proprio ultimamente i nostri studi sull'autoprotezione degli aeromobili stanno venendo presi in considerazione per l'impiego su velivoli di linee civili.

Parli di contromisure per i missili degli alleati? No, grazie. Mi assumo il rischio di un'altra Ustica pur di non aggiungere più pazzia al teatrino della sicurezza.

&gt;Poi la società sei tu, cittadino italiano: se ritieni che la spesa militare vada ulteriormente ridotta, dai il tuo voto alla parte politica che ti promette di farlo. Democrazia.

Io sono un cittadino di serie B - ho più doveri e la metà dei diritti - ma nemmeno un cittadino italiano non può fare quello che suggerisci semplicemente perché non c'è nessuno disposto a tagliare le spese militari e a uscire dagli accordi che mandano le forze armate italiane a sparare per la pace all'estero.

&gt;Nessuno di noi mira ai civili.

È difficile mirare da un aereo che deve evitare la difesa antiaerea sopra la Libia. O da un posto di blocco verso un'auto che non si ferma in Iraq. O da un veicolo blindato verso un *black moving object* in Afganistan. Comunque, ciò che conta è l'intenzione, il rispetto degli ordini, la costituzione, l'uniforme e un bel piatto di pasta. I problemi etici sono roba per civili che stano confortevolmente a casa e giudicano con fretta cose che non capiscono invece di utilizzare il loro tempo in maniera più produttiva...

It is the people of this country who determine the positions of our political parties, not the semi-mythical professors you guys fear so much.

I'd ask what scares you so much about not living in a white-majority country, but I really don't care how you justify hatred to yourself. I've never heard of homosexualism. Does that mean you don't think gay people should be able to get married, raise families, etc? Or do you just lack any ability to empathize with groups aren't a part of, or to conceive that they might face problems you don't face?

Then you contradict yourself. You decry us as Neo-Marxists, citing a group that predates WWII, then say we didn't exist until '89. I don't know enough about Czech politics to say, but we have a liberal tradition in the states that can trace itself back to our colonial envoys to Parliament. We've been pushing you assholes to retreat since before the republic was ever founded!

Did the Irish invasion destroy America? I think not. Will the Latino invasion? Hell no. Like those before it, the German migrants and the Asian migrants and the Irish migrants, the influx of Latin immigrants is tempering the our nation's steel. No country ('cept maybe Canada) can rival the extent of personal, family forged international bonds that America can call on, simply because of the liberal tradition of economic integration through universal participation in the market. And guys like you are doing your damnedest to make sure Europe never has that ability, that your cultures remain fractured.

It isn't the dominant language is a number of contexts, especially if you're trading with someone in China, and even where it is used as an intermediary language, it often bears little resemblance to what a native English speaker of any descent would classify as ""English"".

If you want to communicate effectively with someone, the fewer languages there are between you the better. You may think that learning, say, Dutch is irrelevant, since there are only about 28 million speakers worldwide. But you couldn't possibly meet 28 million people in your lifetime. It's entirely possible to life an *entire life*, and be rich and happy and make all the necessary business connections and friends that you could ever wish for *only in Dutch*. The same goes for smaller languages, like Norwegian (about 5 million speakers) or even tiny ones like Icelandic (about 500,000 speakers).

Lato negativo del sesso a pagamento? il fatto che i ragazzini passino davanti a posti del genere e perdano di vista il valore del rapporto con una donna, dell'amore, della fatica di costruire attorno al proprio desiderio e curiosita' per l'altro sesso, lo stimolo a voler costruire un qualcosa di piu', una famiglia, una storia, una continuazione di se'. In parole povere a banalizzare il rapporto con l'altro sesso, ecco.

Pero' considerata la situazione italiana, i punti elencati da chi promuove questa raccolta firma sono tutti giusti, e aggiungo il fatto (datemi del lucroso) che si evita che un sacco di soldi vadano all'estero.

Prendi per esempio la Svizzera o altri paesi, io e degli amici andiamo in Austria molto spesso, li la prostituzione e' legalizzata e regolamentata, ci sono un sacco di FKK club e una marea di italiani si fanno il viaggio fino a li' per trovare quello che in Italia o non c'e' o c'e' a squallidissime condizioni.
Apprendo da La Repubblica che ne stanno aprendo un nuovissimo mega bordello proprio al confine di tarvisio, immaginati i viaggi della speranza-fetish

Un altro vantaggio e' che, sempre a quanto capito, il fatto che ci sia regolamentazione fa si che le ""professioniste"" possano esercitare solo se in possesso di licenza rilasciata dal governo a fronte di visite mediche periodiche (settimanali? mensili? boh...) superate.
D'altro canto questo potrebbe dare un'eccessiva ed effimera sicurezza sull'uso di metodi contracettivi... anche questo e' un lato negativo.

Fatto sta che in paesi come quelli teutonici, questa e' la cultura ormai da decenni, mentre qui in Italia anche se introdotta, potrebbe andare fuori controllo...soprattutto con quello che passano le nostre televisioni, il mix case chiuse +  sedere di gnocche costantemente in mostra in prima serata potrebbe essere fatale per la crescita dei piu' giovani...

&gt;Parli di contromisure per i missili degli alleati? No, grazie. Mi assumo il rischio di un'altra Ustica pur di non aggiungere più pazzia al teatrino della sicurezza.

Parlo di contromisure in maniera generale e non scenderò nei dettagli. Ma immagino che tu sia un esperto anche in questo campo, per poterti assumere certe responsabilità con cotanta leggerezza. Buon per te: è importante avere certezze nella vita. Usa gli strumenti che la nostra Costituzione ti garantisce per portare avanti le tue idee.


&gt;Io sono un cittadino di serie B - ho più doveri e la metà dei diritti - ma nemmeno un cittadino italiano non può fare quello che suggerisci semplicemente perché non c'è nessuno disposto a tagliare le spese militari e a uscire dagli accordi che mandano le forze armate italiane a sparare per la pace all'estero.

Non esistono cittadini di serie B, o sei cittadino italiano oppure no. Ricontrolla la Costituzione. E laddove ti venga riservato un trattamento da ""serie B"" hai tutto il diritto di alzare la voce e ribellarti.  

Le spese militari vengono tagliate eccome. Tant'è che le nostre basi cadono a pezzi e per garantire un minimo di efficienza si fanno salti mortali. Eppure a parte le chiacchiere da sigaretta nessuno si fa da parte, mai, e tutti fanno il massimo. 


&gt;È difficile mirare da un aereo che deve evitare la difesa antiaerea sopra la Libia. O da un posto di blocco verso un'auto che non si ferma in Iraq. O da un veicolo blindato verso un *black moving object* in Afganistan. 

Si è difficile. Quand'è stata l'ultima volta che hai provato? 

&gt;Comunque, ciò che conta è l'intenzione, il rispetto degli ordini, la costituzione, l'uniforme e un bel piatto di pasta. 

Le prime quattro si. La quinta se vuoi prenditela pure. Se questa discussione deve vertere sul malcelato disprezzo o peggio ancora su una gelosia infondata, meglio cederti un piatto di pasta. La qualità del rancio non posso assicurartela, dovrai accontentarti.

&gt;I problemi etici sono roba per civili che stano confortevolmente a casa e giudicano con fretta cose che non capiscono invece di utilizzare il loro tempo in maniera più produttiva...

No, non tutti i civili, abbiamo grandissimo rispetto. Proprio tu in particolare, avendo a più riprese dimostrato quanto ridotta sia la tua percezione sia del mondo militare sia del sistema difesa. E il bello è che contesti fatti assodati.



&gt;Sì. È la parola di un governo che ogni tanto tratta con la mafia contro la parola dei giornalisti che non vogliono campare cent'anni in pace. 

Chissà. Io ho visto anche giornalisti che ""da fonti certe"" hanno rovinato per sempre la reputazione di persone poi trovate innocenti in sede di giudizio. Guarda, le verità assolute non esistono, da nessuna parte. Il tuo punto resta:
A) non provato. Non basta un link ad un articolo per fare verità.
B) del tutto inconsistente. Credi che sia solo il nostro Paese a tenere accordi con le tribù locali? 

Nota finale: ho notato che, a parte elementi selezionati in modo da poter riversare ulteriore bile ingiustificata, stai evitando di rispondere alle mie domande. Io finora sono stato abbastanza rispettoso da riprendere le tue punto per punto. Anche il sarcasmo gratuito. Mi perdonerai se alle volte ti ho risposto per le rime: è che mi infastidisce quando - senza fondamento - si offende il lavoro altrui.

«Jaufre Rudel di Blaia fu un uomo molto cortese, principe di Blaia. E si innamorò della contessa di Tripoli, senza vederla, per il bene che ne aveva sentito dire dai pellegrini che venivano da Antiochia. E fece su di lei molte canzoni con delle belle melodie e semplici parole. E per la volontà di vederla, si fece crociato e si mise per mare, e in nave si ammalò e fu condotto a Tripoli, in un albergo, come morto. E fu fatto sapere alla contessa ed ella andò da lui, al suo letto, e lo prese tra le sue braccia. Ed egli seppe che quella era la contessa, e in quel momento recuperò l'udito e il respiro e ringraziò Dio per averlo tenuto in vita fino a che potesse vederla; e così morì tra le sue braccia. E lei lo fece seppellire con grandi onori nella casa del Tempio; e poi, quel giorno stesso, si fece monaca, per il dolore che ebbe per la morte di lui».",0,1382868965,null,0,false,0,cd0jyc0,t3_1pb18h,t1_cd0jyc0,t1_cd0jxot,null,1428968209,7,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,7

http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2013-10/nsa-uerberwachung-merkel-interview-foschepoth/komplettansicht

He mentions a change of the German constitution in 1968 (the so called ""Notstandsgesetze"", state of emergency laws, which changed Article 10 of the constitution guaranteeing the invulnerability of privacy in mail and telecommunications by adding a 2nd paragraph which states ""Limits can only be implemented on the basis of a law. If the limit serves to protect the liberal-democratic fundamental order or the existence of the federal government or one of the federal states, the law can state that those affected will not be informed and that instead of legal process there will be review by organs appointed by the parliament."" - very rough translation of German constitutional legalese)

In the same part he also refers to an additional treaty from 1959 to the NATO troops statute which according to him guarantees the same privileges for intelligence services of US, UK and France and he says that this is still valid today:
""Die gleichen geheimdienstlichen Rechte der drei Westmächte waren aber längst im Zusatzvertrag zum Nato-Truppenstatut von 1959 dauerhaft gesichert. Die gelten bis heute.""
But while finding a changelog to the German constitution is quite easy, I couldn't find the original text of the 1959 online, only a modified version from 1993, so I'm not sure what article of the treaty he refers to.",0,1382873210,null,0,false,0,cd0kgc5,t3_1paooo,t1_cd0kgc5,t1_cd0gytw,null,1428967975,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

*Law*

* Cyprus upholds EU law approximately half the time, reports the EU Commission. “Cyprus has found it particularly challenging to transpose EU directives in policy areas such as: health and consumers (7 new late transposition infringement cases), transport (6), and internal market and services (4) [...] Nineteen complaints dealt with home affairs, most of them on incorrect refusal of asylum requests and restrictive admission of third-country students [note: see *Economy* segment below] while 17 dealt with restricting freedom to provide services and regulated professions that people perceived as interventions to the market. Sixteen complaints on justice issues mostly focused on the residence rights for EU citizens’ third-country partners and unfair consumer contracts. Other complaints still spoke of nationality-based discrimination on public transport and “flaws in nature protection, urban waste-water treatment and car taxation”[[CM]](http://cyprus-mail.com/2013/10/24/cyprus-midway-on-eu-infringement-index/)

* Greek Cypriot businessmen take advantage of Pyla's special circumstances (a village that's still inhabited by both G/Cs and T/Cs though it falls within the DMZ and is only partially controlled by ROC) and set up their businesses in Turkish Cypriot properties, to avoid paying electricity, water and VAT, giving them an advantage over businesses operating in areas that ROC controls effectively [[ANT1]](http://www.ant1iwo.com/kypros/2013/10/24/telos-sthn-ekmetalleysh-t-k-perioysiwn-s/)

true,LowProF1le,null,null,"Objectively speaking, Finnish is 'better' than English because it has a reasonably small vocabulary that almost all speakers can operate with (the size of the Finnish vocabulary is about 20% of the English vocabulary). Most words make internal sense as there are relatively few loan words. It's really easy to work out the meanings of Finnish words even if you've never come across a certain word before. For example, the Finnish word for 'ambition' (try and figure that one out by yourself!) is 'kunnianhimo', which literally means 'lust for glory/honour'. And this is the way most words are formed, they are logical and make sense. Also, spelling is phonetic, which saves years of work. It takes a Finnish child about 6 months to learn to read and write. After this skill has been acquired, all new words can be added to the system with zero effort, whereas in English you have to learn the different illogical spellings for each new word, for the rest of your life. 

Also, the most educated Finns and the least educated Finns do not sound like they come from different planets, which in my opinion is the case in English. 

I find it interesting that you find English good for its brevity. I often deal with both Finnish and English texts, and the English translations of Finnish texts are always longer, sometimes by up to 20%. Finnish is economical and to the point. 

Of course we all tend to prefer our first language, which might make my ramblings a bit irrelevent :)

Just gonna say my personal opinion about people making *really* long news roundup posts in this thread. Whilst I, personally, am very grateful that people are putting in so much effort to create really long and very informative selections of the news in their countries every week; I think I should also say that because they are so long and detailed it might become very difficult to find the time to read. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that there's a real benefit in making shorter and more concise posts in this thread. I have absolutely no problem with there being longer posts because they are just so well researched and so in depth, however I, personally, I would really like there to also be some posts or comments which condense the larger posts into something more manageable, and easily prioritise the more relevant ones. 

I'm sure it would be beneficial to know what other people's views on longer verses shorter posts are. Thanks",0,1382877234,null,0,false,0,cd0kyo8,t3_1pb5ep,t1_cd0kyo8,t3_1pb5ep,null,1428967738,30,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,30

No. This is from their program ([English link](http://www.kscm.cz/our-party/our-programms/39786/)):

&gt;The formation of employee enterprise councils will be promoted, the rights of unions strengthened and all forms of participation by employees in the management of the enterprises supported, ranging from the minimal right to information about the operations and objectives of the enterprise up to participation in decision-making and profit-sharing. Conditions will be created which will allow employees to buy or lease enterprises. 

I had never actually read the program before, but some of it is interesting. They want to promote local production by cutting down on agricultural imports and investing in agri-tech. They talk about protecting the environment: 

&gt;Penalties for damaging the living environment will be increased, and there will be stricter regulation of waste disposal. Damage caused by excessive use of motor vehicles will be reduced by supporting general access to public transport and an enhanced role for railway transport. 

Helping small business:

&gt;Small- and medium-size businesses will be given special protection and assistance, including guarantees for loans and leasing arrangements, support for good-quality products and regional programmes, help with the repayment of loans, programmes assisting new small firms and, in the case of the smallest firms, simplified accounting methods and easier contacts with official offices. 

And protecting workers in larger businesses in crisis:

&gt;Managements of firms which are experiencing difficulties will not be allowed to maintain their own incomes at the expense of employees, whether it be by threatening their rights or redundancies, tax evasion or other illegitimate practices. 

They say they will abolish the senate (insert *Star Wars* reference here), and lower pay for politicians.

true,zebutron,null,null,"In my opinion the best way is to track down each link back in history. Start with family names, first and last, that emigrated to the US. I am assuming you are from the US. The information you find there will give you the next step. http://www.ellisisland.org/ is a good place to start. After you find the ship and the port it left from, you can look for the trail from there. Some of the information on the Ellis island site may also give the passengers original place or residence but this isn't always the case. If the person you are tracking came from a port like Hamburg or Bremen, you can check their records and cross reference the name and place of origin. 

http://immigrantships.net/bremenproj/bremenproject.html


There are other sites like this. I haven't used this one.  I would try to stick with the places that are not charging you money for such information since it is available free of charge through the German government. 

The reason I am mentioning tracking each step back is that, through time, the facts get a little distorted. Family might say that their ancestors were from X but really they only left from X and were born in Y. If you can find solid evidence of where they really came from then you will have a better time tracking down more specifics. Some people just say the largest city nearby. 
 

Some church records are online. There are people who are still doing this sort of genealogy and transcribing the records.

However, a proxy can have it's own SSL certificate. When you try to connect to your destination host, the proxy can simply use it's own SSL cert to establish the connection between proxy and you, and anoither SSL connection between proxy and your desired host.

If fascists are able to sway public opinion to their side by publicity, then there's obviously a much bigger issue at hand and curtailing freedom of speech isn't going to solve it.  

Neo-Nazis are allowed to openly march through the streets in America, but America remains the most pro-Jewish country on the planet besides Israel and absolutely everyone in America hates Nazis.  But, if the same neo-Nazis were thrown in jail for marching through the streets, they could draw impressionable people to their side by going on about how ""ZOG"" wants to silence them - which is exactly what they do in other countries.

I find this interesting. From what I understand, despite the fact that Russia has a fair few minority groups who are technically considered Russian, many Russians seem to think that the term Russian should only apply to (non-Ukrainan/Belarussian) Slavic Orthdox Christians that most people think of when they think of Russians. The government (as far as I know) doesn't seem bothered to dissuade people of this view. 

But by strengthening the idea of an officially Russian Islam, could the state be trying to be more inclusive of people like Chechens and immigrants from the 'stans? It seems to be a wise way to curb terrorism (among the Chechens) and very forward-thinking, considering current demographic tends in Russia (immigration, Muslims tending to have lower alcohol/drug use and higher birthrates than other groups, etc).

* Center-right UMP Party leader, Copé, has said he's against automatic citizenship for children born in France. (Pretty easy to read between the lines here: he doesn't want ""dem dirty ay-rabs and gyps"" becoming French because they're born in France.)  
* Titan CEO Maurice Taylor, who infamously called French workers ""lazy,"" now does a u-turn and offers to buy the Goodyear factory in Amiens (northern France).

It's annoying to think not only is the US spying/stealing information on everyone, especially when people thought they were an allied state. And that most likely they used their technology firms such as Microsoft and Google to their advantage for this mass theft of information. But that the government themselves probably either didn't give a shit or let them do it and even assisted them.

There's multiple layers of anger and it's directed at lots of different people. 

Besides, if the US is allowed to have information about everyone and everything in this country, are we allowed to have the same about the US? I doubt it very much. So that's another thing too. The relationship is obviously very lop sided.

I just want the government to at least try and stop the US in its mass theft of information and surveillance. You might not succeed all the time, espionage happens everywhere, but for fucks sake, at least try and act like you're a sovereign state.

For most immigrants, whether the applicant has sufficient English skills is what the company will be most worried about. When applicants come from Italy or Poland, a company like Maersk wants to see evidence of English skills, but doesn't ask for evidence of Danish skills. The main exceptions are jobs in the service industry. You cannot work at most stores or restaurants without speaking Danish.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Les mensonges imaginaires de journalistes qui n'ont pas compris que la technique de diabolisation renforce le FN.

Nulle part il est ou dit que les immigrés ""nous envahissent"". Nulle part il est dit que ""La prochaine immigration sera asiatique"". Ou que ""la France ""championne d’Europe"" de l’immigration légale"". Ce sont des inventions pour caricaturer une position politique.

D'autre part 

1. Les immigrés n’ont ""jamais été aussi nombreux"". En proportion, c'est à peu près stable. En nombre total c'est vrai : Selon les recensements partiels de l’INSEE, il y avait 3 771 000 étrangers en France en 2009 contre 3 338 000 en 1999, chiffre auquel il faut rajouter les naturalisations.

2. Les expulsions ""ont ralenti"" sous François Hollande : [Source](http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2013/10/08/01016-20131008ARTFIG00588-clandestins-la-police-francaise-relache-son-effort.php).     
Extrait : le rythme moyen d'éloignement des étrangers en situation irrégulière est passé de 100 personnes par jour l'an dernier à 60 par jour pour les huit premiers mois de l'année
3. Les immigrés ""servent le grand patronat"" ? Vrai : [Rapport du CAE](http://ingiagzennay.free.fr/Immigration-Gilles-Saint-Paul.pdf). L'argument est ridicule et sous entend que 90% des immigrés ne travaillent pas (comment vivent-ils ? doit-on s'étonner de leur pauvreté dans ce cas ?). Un petit rappel de [Francis Bouygues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5dsEMl_F0Y)...
4. Les ""salaires baissent"" à cause des immigrés ? Vrai : [Rapport du CAE](http://ingiagzennay.free.fr/Immigration-Gilles-Saint-Paul.pdf). C'est prouvé partout pour les emplois non qualifiés. Dans ce cas, soit l'immigration empêche la hausse des salaires (l'immigré n'a pas le choix) soit elle augmente le chômage.
5. En augmentant le critère de ressources à 1,5 SMIC au lieu de 1 RSA, on divise le regroupement familial par 10 (-80 000 immigrés).     
Reste à appliquer le droit d'asile : aucun accord à renégocier, 70% des demandes sont à rejeter (30 000 renvois / an)

Enfin, je terminerai en dénonçant le mythe que l'immigration rapporte : l'immigration a, selon [le dernier rapport de l'OCDE](http://www.english.rfi.fr/africa/20130614-immigrants-contribute-more-they-cost-oecd-reports-finds), un impact fiscal négatif de 0,52% du PIB en France :

Ce qui me gène avec la social-démocratie c'est l'endoctrinement de la population. A un moment plus personne ne se rend compte que l'Etat est partout. Tu en es un parfait exemple. 

&gt; Capitalisme de connivence entre États et multinationales. Aggravé par un système financier mal maîtrise et malhonnête et encore pire.

La connivence n'est là que parce que l'état a un périmètre d'intervention trop large.

&gt; En gros, il y avait trop de pognon n'importe où sauf dans le travail. C'est une crise de la profitabilité bien marxiste comme il faut. Avec de belles défaillances de marché qui contredisent l'utopie de l'autorégulation.

T'as réussi à parler de la valeur travail, de Marx avant d'expliquer que l'échec d'un marché avec plein d'interventionnisme des états montrait que l'autorégulation ne marchait pas. Kamoulox!

&gt; Diversion pour faire oublier son impuissance. Ces lois ne sont pas appliquées. C'est l'application de la loi qui compte.

J'en parlerais à mon inspecteur du travail...

Merci de rappeler qu'un bon régime socialiste ne va pas sans un minimum de nationalisme.

La dépense publique est destructrice de richesse. Le phénomène s'autoalimente, toujours moins de demande, toujours plus de dépense publique...

&gt; Les multinationales et les super riches qui ont le pouvoir n'ont jamais été aussi peu taxés. Exemple parmi d'autres de la soumission des États et des problèmes du capitalisme de connivence.

true,Rc72,EURO,European Union,"&gt; The software patent issue is pretty much a US thing.

While European patent practice is somewhat stricter, excluding for instance business-related patents, plenty of patents related to software are granted and upheld in court.

The Apple vs. Samsung fight, in Germany and other European courts, has involved so far not only trade dress (more precisely, registered designs), but also patents, most notably Apple's [European patent EP 1 964 022 B1](http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?FT=D&amp;date=20100310&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;CC=EP&amp;NR=1964022B1&amp;KC=B1&amp;ND=1) on ""slide-to-unlock"". Samsung has retaliated with patents on wireless signal processing that are essential to the UMTS standard.

The important difference between Europe and the US is not so much the criteria for granting and maintaining patents, but how patent litigation is carried out: in the US litigation is ridiculously expensive, and the loser in a lawsuit is rarely forced to cover the legal costs of the winning party. This has promoted the growth of so-called ""patent trolls"", who buy up patents and use threats of litigation to extort royalty payments from third parties, even if they don't even remotely infringe the patent and/or the patent is manifestly invalid: it's cheaper to pay the royalties than to litigate...

true,DeepSeaDweller,CROA,Croatia,"&gt;Something that didn't include forcing people into a state that failed little over half a dozen years earlier?

Such as? Who would have led any other push? Whose support would they have had? The Partisans were overwhelmingly the largest force in the area and they facilitated the creation of the federation. Individual nationalist causes had no legitimacy having just pursued policies of genocide, ethnic cleansing, and xenophobia against ethnic minorities (Serbs, Croats, Albanians, and Bosnian Muslims were guilty of some or all of these).

Additionally, I wouldn't say it was the same state. Efforts were taken to decentralize power relative to the kingdom, something that non-Serb politicians and parties fought for during the interwar period.

&gt;And you think it was different in other parts of Eastern Europe? Have you ever bothered checking what the literacy rates were in Poland? At the end of Austria-Hungary, literacy rates in Poland were below 10%, whereas on the territory of Slovenia and Croatia they were 30-40%. Should Poles look with nostalgia at the Soviet dominated communist era because it raised their literacy levels to western standards?

&gt;Do you think Baltics had it better outside of cities? Native populations had attrocious levels of literacy and no industry. They should also be thankful for what SSSR did to them!

&gt;Yet despite all that ""culture"" that Krakow had, Krakow's county had a literacy rate lower than that of Zagreb whereas the other nearby counties had a literacy level more than three times lower than the average for Croatia. And that's in the ""progressive"" Slesian part of the country.

I didn't know these figures, but I don't think they're particularly relevant. Maybe I was wrong about how far behind we were, but it doesn't mean that Tito's Yugoslavia and the eastern bloc did not educate the masses. Something that capitalists, fascists, democrats, what-have-you did not accomplish. Education is one of the positive legacies of the period, nobody denies this.

I will address this though,

&gt;They were centers of culture, attracting Central European foreigners (Germans, Jews, Hungarians) in the same way Ljubljana, Zagreb, Osijek, Rijeka, etc. attracted.

They were centers of culture as well as education (I failed to mention this in my last post) and attracted people from all over Europe. Those cities you mentioned attracted people from their immediate rural areas, such as Slavonia, Zagorje, Bosnia, Gorski Kotar, Lika, Herzegovina, Dalmatia, etc. They are incomparable.

""In Ausnahmesituationen katastrophischen Ausmaßes""

Dieser Begriff ist so schwammig, theoretisch ist die Bundeswehr also in jeder Situation zu rufen, die potentiell in einer Katastrophe münden könnte. Ausnahmesituation muss hier nicht einmal beachtet werden, da jede Abweichung vom Normalzustand ja eine Ausnahmesituation darstellt.

Was wäre also ""katastrophischen Ausmaßes? Volksprotest mit dem Ziel die Regierung zu stürzen? Durchaus, nachher installiert der Mob noch einen Diktator. 

Bestrebungen Deutschland aus Europa zu lösen? Terrorakte? Entlaufene Kühe die auf den Reichstag stürmen? 

Das andere Problem: Der Verfassungsbruch kann immer erst im Nachhinein beanstandet werden. Dies ging bei einem Absolutverbot nicht. Da konnte man eben nicht die Bundeswehr vor dem Reichstag aufziehen und in die Menge schießen lassen, es war strikt verboten. Heute macht man das und lässt sich danach die Verfassungswidrigkeit bescheinigen. Wen störts? Darauf steht ja keine Strafe.

[Weiter mit dem Niederschießen von Aufständen im Rahmen der europäischen Rechtsprechung:](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertrag_von_Lissabon#Grundrechtecharta_und_Beitritt_zur_Europ.C3.A4ischen_Menschenrechtskonvention)

Man lese und staune: 

Erläuterungen zu Art. 2 Abs. 2 Europäischen Menschenrechtskonvention:

„Eine Tötung wird nicht als Verletzung dieses Artikels betrachtet, wenn sie durch eine Gewaltanwendung verursacht wird, die unbedingt erforderlich ist, um

a) jemanden gegen rechtswidrige Gewalt zu verteidigen;

b) jemanden rechtmäßig festzunehmen oder jemanden, dem die Freiheit rechtmäßig entzogen ist, an der Flucht zu hindern;

**c) einen Aufruhr oder Aufstand rechtmäßig niederzuschlagen“**

Abgesehen davon, dass a) und b) schon völlig indiskutabel sind, ist c) ja wohl der Rückfall in längst vergessene Zeiten. Da darf der Staat also losmetzeln wenn es ihm ans Eingemachte geht? Also nicht nur einen Aufstand vom Volke sondern sogar schon bei Aufruhr? 

Was wenn die Banken über die Regierung demnächst einfach einen Teil unserer Vermögens beschlagnahmen so wie in Papieren des IWF vorgesehen? Ist ein Bankrun ein Aufruhr? Die sind ja systemrelvant, was wenn das dann zusammenbricht? Was wenn sich das Volk dagegen wehrt? Gleich die Bundeswehr schicken oder lieber erst durch die Polizei knüppeln lassen?

Und wie sieht es aus wenn dies in einem Land der EU passiert? Darf man da Amtshilfe leisten? Französische Polizisten haben ja schon fröhlich auf deutsche Castorgegner eingedroschen, aus den Gesetzen lässt sich auch ohne weiteres eine militärische Unterstützung von EU Staaten konstruieren. Im schlimmsten Fall wird das eben alles danach als verfassungswidrig abgetan, aber das hatten wir ja weiter oben schon.

Hitler kam an die Macht und ließ sich einfach ermächtigen. Heute macht man es subtil, kein Mensch glaubt doch heute mehr, dass es sich bei der Totalüberwachung und der ganzen Antiterrormilitarisierung der Polizeien um Maßnahmen zum Schutz der Bürger handelt. Die sind zum Feind geworden, dem man Unkontrollierbarkeit vorwirft.

Jedes System richtet sich gegen die, welche es seiner Macht berauben können. Der König kerkert den Bastard seiner Frau ein, der Diktator lässt die Opposition einsperren und erschießen und die Demokratie entmachtet das Volk, den Souverän.

Die EU ist eine einwandfreie Plutokratie mit faschistischen Zügen. Wie man sieht ist sie auch die Begründung dafür in Deutschland Unruhen mit Waffengewalt zu bekämpfen und das Parlament bei Bundeswehreinsätzen nicht mehr befragen zu müssen.

Wer im Kosovo Massengräber ausgehoben und in Afghanistan Deutschland ""verteidigt"" hat wird wohl auch eine gesündere Einstellung zu Kriegen haben als jemand der durch völlig bekloppte Äußerungen zu völkerrechtswidrigen Interventionen einen auf Mann machen will.

Und vielleicht sollte man den heute völlig ungebildeten Soldaten auch ein wenig Militärliteratur zu lesen geben, die nicht von irgendeinem rot/grünen Kriegstreiber geschrieben wurde:

A professional soldier understands that war means killing people, war means maiming people, war means families left without fathers and mothers. All you have to do is hold your first dying soldier in your arms, and have that terribly futile feeling that his life is flowing out and you can’t do anything about it. Then you understand the horror of war.
Any soldier worth his salt should be antiwar. And still there are things worth fighting for.

It struck me that the preservation of the buildings and monuments called your attention but I guess that it makes kind of sense as you come from the States (please don't take this the wrong way, I don't mean it in a disrespectful way) I find that in Spain there is little or no respect for public property in big cities and unfortunately we don't seem to cherish all the historical sites that we have. Unfortunately I think is a matter of education and as the situation is now, good education in general is going to be something difficult to come by for the new generations.

As for the youth in Spain, you got it right. Despair is affecting the majority of under 25's as unemployment in that age ups to more than 50%. This has to do with the fact that up until know, what was promoted both by the government and society was to get as many graduates as possible. I was raised under the idea that the more you studied the more likely you would get a good job and easier access to education for low-income families made possible for everyone to go to University. Now we find ourselves with an overage of graduates that can't get a job because there is not enough demand for high qualified people. And on the other hand you have all the people that left school to work in the building industry which was access to money without too much effort. 

This subject could do for a veeery long post and I definitely don't want to sound arrogant in my opinions on the matter so will leave it for now. You can always PM me.

true,salad-dressing,HUNG,Hungary,"I would have guessed that the percentage was higher than just 6% (although that number was for the entire country, not Transylvania), but after 3 generations, the cultures have intermarried, and the 3rd generation now, while perhaps still holding onto Hungarian family names, are mixed-ethnicity, and may likely no longer feel such a close tie to their grandparent's and parents' native land that they'd fight for autonomy. I really can't see this ever happening. After Trianon, the Romanian government moved ethnic Romanian families into Transylvania so as to dilute the region, and that has certainly come to fruition. The Empire of Austria-Hungary certainly overstepped their bounds, and took many lands to which they had no rightful claim. When they were punished after the wars, they lost many lands to which they did have rightful claim. It's somewhat unfortunate, but it was the cost of going too far. Bratislava (Pozsony) is another example of a city which was purely Hungarian for 900 years prior to the World Wars, and it was just taken away. Large parts of Transylvania fall into that same category, including Cluj (Kolozsvár), but far too much time has passed since the two World Wars (during which time there was something of a back and forth). The amount of people that believe strongly enough in this to protest for it is nowhere near enough. Most Hungarians have long ago accepted this as a reality, and I think most Transylvanians have too.

I also have a problem with the damages awards requested.

For Transylvania (meaning Transylvania proper+Partium+Banat) it's about 20%.

&gt;After Trianon, the Romanian government moved ethnic Romanian families into Transylvania so as to dilute the region, and that has certainly come to fruition.

I don't think that was very extensive. Also a lot of Hungarians moved out after WW1 and more did after WW2 fearing reprisals, especially in more mixed areas. The strongest change was in the cities, where rapid urbanisation during the Communist times brought a lot of Romanians from the surrounding countryside, which I mentioned [in another comment (but that's not such a strange phenomenon actually)](http://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/1p4dtj/the_ethnic_groups_of_austriahungary_in_1910/ccz8brs?context=3)

true,drakeisatool,DENK,Denmark,"I can recommend readting the paper that the article links to. It's not even that long.

I see several problems with this framework - of course, if it's somehow accepted by the EU council, the implementation details are still up to the individual country. Then again, EU rules have a tendency to pass into national law as a kind of fait accompli, and if the rules aren't adopted, the country can face heavy criticism for it.

There are several problems with the suggested rules. A major one for Denmark would be that several of the proposed rules would be in violation of our constitution; there is a paragraph which states that censorship shall never be implemented. I expect other EU countries have similar paragrahs in their constitutions.

This flies in the face of the suggestions that media moderate their content in order to prevent the spreading of intolerance.

Additionally, it's problematic to punish ""overt approval of a totalitarian ideology"" and public approval or denial of genocide. For one, these definitions are vague - what constitutes a totalitarian ideology? Nazism is generally accepted as totalitarian, so I guess a Nazi march would be punishable under the new framework. But how about state communism? 

It's not unusual to see groups carrying the Hammer and Sickle flag as part of larger demonstrations here in Denmark. Should that be punishable too?

The main rule of the paper is that intolerance shouldn't be tolerated. General muslim-bashing aside, wouldn't the Salafist movement be subject to heavy sanctions then? 

Another thing that disturbs me is that anti-feminism is on the list of intolerance. But feminism is a large and diverse institution. If you support the idea of gender equality, but think the feminist movement is headed in the wrong direction, should your speech be sanctioned? How about if you have critique of your government's attempt at implementing feminist inspired law, is that enough? How about if you identify as a part of the feminist movement, but are critical of a prominent feminist figure? Should you be worried that you would be accused of being anti-feminist and punished?

I'm using antifeminism as an example, but really it could be any of the different intolerances you could be accused of, where appropriate. It's a well known tactic to shut an opponent up by accusing them of (and hopefully, getting them convicted for :D) doing something illegal. 

These kind of rules enable this behaviour and will not help people coexist as is the intention.

The Moose bar is great too, for new years it was a mad men theme and if you came dressed you got a drink, I got so shit faced. Theres also The galway is also pretty good. You can dance (not a club) and no one would blink an eye. Those are where I like to go, im sure a french person will come up with some other place.

In which country is Dallas, Texas? Miami, Florida? San Diego, California? Would you say those cities are in the United States? Or are those cities in Mexico? Within these massive cities, one may hear the Spanish language spoken as often as the English language. Either now, or in the not too distant future. In many US cities, especially in the south, Spanish is native language spoken by a majority of the local population. Yet these cities are not in Mexico. 

That applies here as well. Bratislava was right on the border with Austria to the west, and with more Slavic territories to the north. Of course you were going to hear those 3 languages spoken by many people. That does not negate the fact that the city was inside the borders of Hungary from the 900's until the 1900's. At no point in time was the city of Bratislava not within the borders of Hungary for almost one thousand years.

Recentemente, ho concluso che l'invenzione della semina e dell'aratro a bue sono databili precisamente al 190000 AC.

L'equazione mi ha permesso inoltre di datare l'introduzione della battuta per raccogliere la frutta al 27000 AC, e l'imbuto per le tette al 12000 AC. Molto più recentemente, nel 1300 DC, le anfore si sono evolute a bicchieri.

If you do decide to go, be SURE to buy your tickets on line ahead of time because the lines to buy tickets are long. But my recommendation is to save that visit for another time. The palace will still be there.

I would skip the aquarium-- it's a very unimpressive and expensive one. The Jardin des Plantes' menagerie is the one from the book Madeline (""to the Tiger in the zoo/Madeline just said 'Pooh! Pooh!'"") and it is fun for children. The Grande Galerie de l'évolution suggested by deLamartine above is also spectacular. Outside, on the Jardin des Plantes side, there is a carousel with dinosaurs instead of the usual carousel animals; but I don't know if it will be open in the winter. 

A boat ride in the Seine should be fun for a child too.

D'accord avec toi, mais ce n'est pas une raison pour mélanger des problématiques. 

Le problème des ressources des étudiants (orphelins ou non) est indépendant de celui de l'héritage. Le Danemark donne une énorme allocation pour les étudiants, sous réserve de réussite. Ça peut être une solution. D'autres mécanismes de transmission du patrimoine des vivants existent. Toujours est il que [les 5 % les mieux dotés en détiennent à eux seuls 35 % et les 1 %, 17 %](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=ip1380). Ces inégalités vont en s'aggravant.

Le problème de la rigidité du marché de l'immobilier n'a pas non plus grand chose à voir avec les successions. Comme je te l'ai dit il y a actuellement 100 000 logements vacants mais les prix ne baissent que très peu (1% de baisse en un an). Le marché de l'immobilier est donc assez peu influencé par l'offre.

Et rappelons que seuls [57% des ménages](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=T10F072) sont propriétaires (en 2007). Permettre d'augmenter cette proportion particulièrement faible me parait être une bonne chose, dans le cas d'une baisse généralisée des prix.

&gt;Tous ces sujets s'entremèlent et c'est ce qui me semble être toute la difficulté de gouverner.

C'est pour cela qu'avant de parler des risques éventuelles, il vaut mieux établir un lien, et chiffrer tes propos avec des sources.

&gt;Et je maintiens que dans la mesure où nous discutions sur Internet, il n'est pas peut-être pas essentiel de se prendre complètement au sérieux ;)

La partita è iniziata bene, dato che l'airone Caracciolo ha subito insaccato di testa nella porta del Parma sotto gli sguardi attoniti di Amauri e Gargano.

Eravamo sull'1 a 0 però, quando si è reso spiacevolmente protagonista quel cornuto dell'arbitro:  ha subito fischiato un rigore a favore del Parma. Noi ovviamente gli abbiamo iastemmato i meglio morti e quando i crociati hanno pareggiato gli abbiamo caldamente consigliato di andare a zappare la terra.

Subito dopo pericolosissimo il numero 27, Juan Antonio che però spara alto con un tiro che ci ha fatto cascare le palle.
Poi però purtroppo il Parma ha insaccato per l'1-2, mentre l'1-3 è avvenuto per mano di Acquah.

Nel finale di gara ancora protagonista la nostra squadra del cuore con una clamorosa traversa che ci ha fatto bestemmiare Cristo e la famiglia sua tutta. Che culo. Che culo.

Alla fine, i tifosi Parmensi si sono presi un po' troppa confidenza con l'esultare e abbiamo finito per pigliarci a mazzate. Io stessa ne ho accoltellato uno e ora sono in manette.

At a substantially higher income I would most certainly travel back and forth between -

Tokyo, Manhattan, London, Paris, Florence, island Croatia, Amsterdam, Hong Kong, San Francisco and maybe Berlin and some parts of Australia. These are all very expensive and urban locales, and since I am  awkward with loneliness and anxiety, I would need sufficient money to cushion myself. I'd rent furnished apartments and stay in each place 1-2 months. I tried Tenerife and it was horrible. I had a look at Serbia and it terrified me. I had a look at Milan and it was dreary but interesting. San Francisco looked apocalyptic but given sufficient income it offers some amazing range of options. Washington DC was quite for a while but I certainly wouldn't want to live in such a vile and corrupt place. 

I'd need to more than quadruple my current income for my full range of plans. This is not very likely at this stage.

It should exist, but Bratislava should not have been a part of it. Like it says in the link you posted...at the onset of WWI, the city was 42% German (Austrian), 41% Hungarian, and 15% Slovakian.

true,salad-dressing,HUNG,Hungary,"From Wikipedia: Bratislava

The first written reference to a settlement named ""Brezalauspurc"" dates to **907** and is related to a battle, during which a **Bavarian army was defeated by the Hungarians.** It is connected to the fall of Great Moravia, already weakened by its own inner decline and under the attacks of the Hungarians. 

In the 10th century, the territory of Pressburg (what would later become Pozsony county) became part of Hungary (called ""the Kingdom of Hungary"" from 1000). It developed as a key economic and administrative centre on the kingdom's frontier. This strategic position destined the city to be the site of frequent attacks and battles, but also brought it economic development and high political status. It was granted its first known ""town privileges"" in 1291 by the Hungarian King Andrew III, and was declared a free royal town in 1405 by King Sigismund. In 1436 he authorized the town to use its own coat of arms.

The Kingdom of Hungary was defeated by the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Mohács in 1526. The Turks besieged and damaged Pressburg, but failed to conquer it. Owing to Ottoman advances into Hungarian territory, **the city was designated the new capital of Hungary in 1536**, becoming part of the Austrian Habsburg monarchy and marking the beginning of a new era. The city became a coronation town and the seat of kings, archbishops (1543), the nobility and all major organisations and offices. Between 1536 and 1830, eleven Hungarian kings and queens were crowned at St. Martin's Cathedral. The 17th century was marked by anti-Habsburg uprisings, fighting with the Turks, floods, plagues and other disasters, which diminished the population.

But you should read it. You and some others seem to think that the city was never really Hungarian. That's what I'm arguing against. I don't think we have a right to claim it as ours in the present day. But you and some others are mistaken when you say those cities were never Hungarian.

From Wikipedia: Bratislava

The first written reference to a settlement named ""Brezalauspurc"" dates to **907** and is related to a battle, during which a **Bavarian army was defeated by the Hungarians.** It is connected to the fall of Great Moravia, already weakened by its own inner decline and under the attacks of the Hungarians.

In the **10th century**, the territory of Pressburg (what would later become Pozsony county) became part of Hungary (called ""the Kingdom of Hungary"" from 1000). It developed as a key economic and administrative centre on the kingdom's frontier. This strategic position destined the city to be the site of frequent attacks and battles, but also brought it economic development and high political status. It was granted its first known ""town privileges"" in 1291 by the Hungarian King Andrew III, and was declared a free royal town in 1405 by King Sigismund. In 1436 he authorized the town to use its own coat of arms.

The Kingdom of Hungary was defeated by the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Mohács in 1526. The Turks besieged and damaged Pressburg, but failed to conquer it. Owing to Ottoman advances into Hungarian territory, **the city was designated the new capital of Hungary in 1536**, becoming part of the Austrian Habsburg monarchy and marking the beginning of a new era. The city became a coronation town and the seat of kings, archbishops (1543), the nobility and all major organisations and offices. Between 1536 and 1830, eleven Hungarian kings and queens were crowned at St. Martin's Cathedral. The 17th century was marked by anti-Habsburg uprisings, fighting with the Turks, floods, plagues and other disasters, which diminished the population. Coronation of Maria Theresa in 1741

**Pressburg flourished during the 18th-century reign of Queen Maria Theresa, becoming the largest and most important town in Hungary.**

It matters when it's a high number. When it's just 100 people protesting then you can dismiss them as loonies. When it's a significant portion of the population then it means serious business. People don't just go out and waste their Sunday on a political issue they don't care about.

You can continue to claim that they have perfect rights and that Romania follows all conventions and everyone is guaranteed everything but that is obviously not true if you have people demanding more rights.

That's a false policy because the referendum would obviously be held on the territory of the whole country and the majority will reject it. And I believe a referendum about territorial change would be illegal anyway, according to the current constitution...

In various parts of Romania you can hear legends about how a non-Székely Romanian can easily run into conflicts with Székelys over trivial issues, while traveling through the areas where the latter live. However, I've never known someone in person who actually had any xenophobic problems with Székelys. I think this animosity has thrived by itself amongst both Romanians and Székelys / Hungarians because both parties have been strongly traumatized by historical events that split their ethnics up dramatically.

* What I find dangerous is that in the last couple of years, the nationalistic rhetoric has been ramped up amongst Székelys, fueled both by a strongly degraded Hungarian political class (which has become a problem at the European level) and by a weak Székely political class in Romania. One of their major parties has been in all Romanian governments since 1989 but they've been cut out of the current government. Thus, those politicians can't easily steal money anymore and so they proceeded to use a nationalistic political rhetoric amongst Székelys in order to maintain their position against other rising Székely political parties. This in-fighting actually hurts the Székelys because all their votes need to go to a single party in order for it to pass the 5% of votes required to get into parliament. So political fragmentation amongst Székelys leads to their politicians becoming rabid for money / power which leads to nationalistic political rhetorics which inevitably will lead to more serious problems.

* I actually wish the Székelys politicians would understand and address the concerns of the other Romanians. Unfortunately, they come through as simple minded and arrogant, blindingly pushing for radical movements that would help the Székelys with the ""only"" cost being that the other 90%+ of Romanians should just ""suck it"". This coupled with their comical inability to speak Romanian makes them 100% rejects amongst the 90%+ of the Romanian population that actually has to agree with whatever changes they wish for. I, for one, am for maximum autonomy granted to various Romanian regions because this would get politicians closer to the people and would split the power now crystallized in a central structure, in Bucharest, that is hard to break and deeply infected with cross-party corruption. The split would benefit all Romanians and would be of special interest to Székelys. That's why I'm frustrated by their common, greedy politicians, incapable to see this great opportunity that they could intelligently champion for all Romanians with the Székelys getting some bonus benefits.

The House of Habsburg was one of the most important royal houses of Europe. The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs between 1438 and 1740. The house also produced kings of Bohemia, England, Germany, Hungary, Croatia, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, as well as rulers of several Dutch and Italian countries.

Following periods of successive habitation by Celts, Romans, Huns, Slavs, Gepids, and Avars, the foundation of Hungary was laid in the late 9th century by the Hungarian grand prince Árpád. His great-grandson Saint Stephen I ascended to the throne in 1000 AD, converting the country to a Christian kingdom. **The Kingdom of Hungary existed for 946 years** and at various points was regarded as one of the cultural centers of the Western world. After the Battle of Mohács and about 150 years of partial Ottoman occupation (1541–1699), Hungary became part of the Habsburg Empire, and later formed part of the Austro–Hungarian Empire (1867–1918).

Faux : 

Le rapport complet est [ici](http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/economics/oecd-economic-surveys-european-union-2012_eco_surveys-eur-2012-en#page1). L'OCDE préconise de diminuer largement les allocations familiales, chômage et retraite. Dans ces conditions, l'immigration est souhaitable et bénéfique. Dans ces conditions seulement.

&gt;le travail des immigrés ne « concurrencerait » qu’une fraction du salariat issu des anciennes vagues d’immigration

À nouveau faux. Cela a été prouvé [au Royaume-Uni](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/9004733/Immigation-does-keep-Britons-out-of-jobs-government-committee-admits.html), pour l'immigration hors-UE. Par contre, dès qu'on prend en compte l'immigration intra-UE, les chiffres changent.

C'est [la même chose en France](http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2012/06/15/les-descendants-d-immigres-plus-exposes-au-chomage-que-les-immigres_1719482_3224.html), il faut distinguer les immigrés hors-UE des autres dans les études.

&gt;Si la France optait pour une « immigration zéro », ce n’est pas 3 % du PIB supplémentaire qu’il faudrait trouver à l’horizon 2050 pour financer la protection sociale, mais 5 % du PIB

Comme déjà dit ailleurs, et confirmé par l'OCDE que tu cites pourtant, l'immigration a en France un impact négatif sur les recettes fiscales. S'en servir pour justifier un gain est donc absurde. Et encore une fois, on oublie de comptabiliser le coût en infrastructure et en intégration. Voir par exemple [cette étude au Royaume-Uni](http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/6869/1/MPRA_paper_6869.pdf).

Et c'est ce que rappelait Maurice Allais, le seul prix Nobel français d'économie :

*Les raisonnements économiques sur l'immigration sont ici généralement tout à fait superficiels . C'est un fait que dans les différents pays, le capital national reproductible est de l'ordre de quatre fois le revenu national. Il en résulte que lorsqu'un travailleur immigré supplémentaire arrive, il faudra finalement pour réaliser les infrastructures nécessaires (logements, hôpitaux, écoles, universités, infrastructures de toutes sortes, installations industrielles, etc....) une épargne supplémentaire égale à quatre fois le salaire annuel de ce travailleur.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;Could the Supreme court order something that would change the system?

""Change the system"" is vague.  The Supreme Court has the final say about interpretations of the Constitution, but it cannot literally change the wording of the Constitution.  It can only interpret words differently, and it is supposed to be restricted, at least somewhat, by precedent.  While technically the Court could interpret the Constitution in extremely radical ways, it fears the popular backlash that might result.  It's analogous to the Queen of England's power to veto legislation, which she rarely exercises (and never exercises on important issues) because of the fear that the public wouldn't stand for it, and possibly also due to her believing that it would be inappropriate to exercise power that way.  The same applies to the Court's interpretative power.

Changing the words of the actual Constitution would require either 1) a supermajority of Congress and a supermajority of the state legislatures to approve the amendment, or 2) a Constitutional Convention to which each state would send delegates for the purpose of changing the Constitution.  Method 1 has has happened before, but today it would be impossible to get 75% or more of Congress to agree to anything.  Method 2 has not happened since 1783 and would be very dangerous, as the Convention would get to make as many changes as it could agree upon, and I bet the state legislatures would appoint delegates for the purpose of benefiting one of the two political parties, not the overall good of the nation.",0,1382922456,null,0,1382922641,0,cd10aci,t3_1pbj5b,t1_cd10aci,t1_cd0yhng,null,1428960445,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;I was thinking about a paragragh that granted a fair voting system, that may forbade something like gerrymandering.

The Court can't add language to the Constitution, so it couldn't insert a new paragraph.  It also can't take initiative, meaning that it can only review court cases that others have brought.  

Here's an example.  

1)  The First Amendment says that Congress shall not infringe the right to free speech. 

2) Congress passes a law that restricts the amount of money that individuals and organizations can donate to politicians.

3) A wealthy person thinks that this law violates his 1st Amendment right to free speech.

4) He goes to court to get the law overturned.

5) Initially, at the district court (trial court; the lowest level of the court system), he loses.  So he appeals to his circuit court (an appellate court; the intermediate level of the federal court system, which reviews the decisions of district courts but doesn't take new evidence into consideration).

6)  Again, he loses at the appellate level, so he appeals to the Supreme Court.  If the Supreme Court decides to review his case, then and only then can it begin to influence this issue.

7) The Supreme Court now has to judge if the previous court correctly interpreted the 1st Amendment.  When this actually happened recently (the *Citizens United* case), the Supreme Court interpreted the word ""speech"" to include ""donation of money for political causes,"" based on the argument that such donations express support for a political idea.

The US system is idealistic, there wasn't much in terms of practical experience to look at. It's based on geography, and the idealistic assumption that people from one electoral district would elect the most able representative to defend their district's interest in a chamber where reason would prevail.  
The flaw, IMHO, lies in this assumption. In reality, regional considerations play a minor role in political convictions, and as a result the parties emerged as electoral clubs to bundle votes of similarly thinking people behind a common candidate, and the FPTP system dictates that there can only two dominant parties which are primarily concerned with keeping the other guy from winning. That's what makes it so polarized and inherently destructive.

The German constitution was written when there already was a lot of experience with other systems, not least our own from the Weimar Republic. In some ways, it's German Democracy 2.0, now with [Fortified Democracy™](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streitbare_Demokratie). They took the Weimar Constitution, looked at everything that had lead to instability and loopholes that were exploited by the Nazis (""Interesting, it doesn't say anywhere that you can't be chancellor and president at the same time, apparently we have to make it explicit.""), and fixed it. This brought us concepts like e.g., the *constructive* vote of non-confidence. In the Weimar Republic, the Nazis and the Communists sometimes voted together to remove the chancellor from office, but of course couldn't agree on a common candidate to replace him. Now, chancellors are removed from office by simply electing a new one, so there's no gap. It goes on like this; if you want to properly understand the Basic Law, you have to look at the Weimar Constitution and how Hitler came to power, it's actually quite fascinating.

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"Here's another perspective: the U.S. Constitution is very difficult to change because it is not meant to be changed unless a huge majority of the population agrees on it. This is designed, essentially, to prevent a group of Jacobins from making radical changes to the structure of the government without the consent of a large majority of the population. By making the obstacles to changing the fundamental structure of government very high, the authors of the Constitution sought to limit any social upheaval from unpopular governmental changes by requiring at least a hefty proportion of the population to be on board with any potential change to the structure of government. The system isn't meant to be hard to change because it's perfect as it is, but so that it isn't changed without the consent of most of the population, because otherwise you'll have civil wars and revolutions all over the place.

I think you're confusing the Constitution with just our laws generally. We have all kinds of crazy old laws (especially in Massachusetts, which was settled by zealous Calvinists), but none of those are in the Constitution.
